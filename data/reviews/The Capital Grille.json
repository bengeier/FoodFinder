{"text":"Excellent dry-aged beef. You won' find a better one in town. And you will pay dearly for it.  Similar in atmosphere and menu to Morton's, the Capital Grille is located on the ground floor of the former Lazarus building at the corner of Wood & Fifth.  Expect dark paneled wood, a massively overpriced (300% and up) wine list, and oil paintings of Pittsburgh's forefathers (including Mr. Rogers).  The little things, like impeccable service by the bartenders, and umbrellas to your car on rainy nights by the valet staff, are refereshing.   Regarding the food - appetizers were just ok. I'd give a big thumbs up to the any of the dry aged steaks (simple and delicious and the house speciality) and a thumbs down to the Filet Oscar (Filet Mignon topped with lump crabmeat and a bearnaise sauce).  Also, please do yourself a favor and order the truffle fries (if you like truffles) - these are to die for. Desserts are nothing special - I'd give a pass on the key lime pie.   When I go back, it's straight to the dry aged steak and truffle fries for me."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Perfect burger! Great salad & had nice dessert options, but I was too stuffed to try any of them. Will leave room next time:) will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time trying this restaurant after driving by it countless times. Why did we wait so long. We were there early on a Wednesday and the place was packed so I'd definitely suggest a reservation.  We started with wedge salads where you get almost a whole head of lettuce. Excellent bleu cheese dressing with hunks of bacon to go with it almost fills you up right there.  We both had steaks and both were cooked perfectly. My wife's filet melted in her mouth. My kona crusted NY strip had tons of flavor and very little waste. We both thought the mashed potatoes were really good but were starting to run out of room and we couldn't skip dessert.  The flourless chocolate cake is a winner but I suspect anything you get here will satisfy you.   Chuck, our server, was awesome and the service from everyone all night was perfect. We won't wait so long for a return visit."}
{"text":"Capital Grille is one of our favorites. We've been many times & to many locations...all have been good but tonight was great! If in Vegas ask for Raul Barajas! He is exceptional! My husband & I split a ribeye Kona crusted (not on the menu but suggested by Raul). It was amazing. He treated us to champagne & dessert as it was our anniversary...that's never happened before. He's genuine & made it a great celebration."}
{"text":"Honestly, next time we're in the mood for a good steak we're going to get in the car, drive directly to Fresh Market and purchase the premium filets. They are about half the price, but more importantly the quality of the meat is superior.  My husband enjoyed his lobster bisque and the lobster mac and cheese had several large chunks of lobster that were tender and perfect. My tomato salad came with underripe overly thick slices of tomato on top (which generally made the whole thing look unnappetizing). I'd say it's a reasonable request that if a tomato salad is offered you'd better have ripe tomato, no? Under the thick slices there were some very tasty red, gold, and chocolate colored grape tomatoes that had marinated in the balsamic nicely- those were really good and I did enjoy that part.  Overall the reason we went to Capital Grille in the first place was to enjoy some steak, they fell squarely in the category of mediocre and when taking into account price point Id say sub par. There are better places for the price point, we won't be back unless my husband has a craving for the lobster mac and cheese . . ."}
{"text":"What a great experience.  The service was some of the best I've ever had in any restaurant and the \"Generous Pour\" wine sampling was fabulous.  Our waitress, Michelle, was extremely knowledgeable about the menu items as well as the wine she was serving us...that's a HUGE plus in my book. We started off by sharing their fried calamari tossed with cherry peppers...fabulous!  We then shared the house chopped salad, which was full of great stuff and tossed in a light vinegarette dressing.  I liked more than my wife did.  For our entree, we shared the delmonico steak, lobster mac and cheese and creamed spinach.  We had a problem with the steak because it was way over cooked.  Michelle cheerfully took it back, apologized and brought us a new one along with all new fresh sides.  The steak was just ok and we really should've ordered the porterhouse but the sides were just rediculously good.  She then proceeded to buy us 2 desserts of our choice...carrot cake (special) and chocolate hazelnut cake (on the menu).  The carrot cake was one of the best I've ever had but the chocolate cake just ok. Through each course Michelle brought us more wine tastings and I believe we had 7 overall. It was great night and even though the steak was not a favorite, I would return again and simply pick a different one."}
{"text":"Every experience at the Capital Grille exceeds our expectation. It is like being with family. From the food, cocktails, leadership and the servers, you could not ask for a better dining experience. Thanks to Brian, Travis, Sabrina and Oscar for making us so comfortable and appreciated."}
{"text":"This is one of the nicest restaurants I have ever been too.  Fantastic food and excellent service. If you are looking for a great meal downtown Pittsburgh look no more .  Top notch.  Avoid Franco's downtown. Note: Capital grill is not cheap, but the good is delicious, the atmosphere is nice and the staff treats you like royalty.  Great Resturant for special occasions."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in town due to both work and an Anniversary weekend.  We were staying right down the street from this location and decided to try it out.  First, the service is amazing.  Steve L. was our waiter and the guy was pure class.  He was extremely attentive and went through the menu with us since it was our first time at the restaurant.    I have the 14oz strip steak (medium) and it was cooked perfectly.  Tender enough to cut with a fork. My wife got the salmon and said that it was cooked perfectly and had amazing taste.  We got two sides, Truffle Fries and Cream Corn.  The corn had a smoky flavor to it and was awesome.  The fries were ridiculously good.  Not sure how they fry them up, but they were so crunchy on the outside, but nice and soft on the inside.  One thing though, the sides are not HUGE, but a large portion, perfect for two people to share.   Overall, this is definitely a 5 star experience worth the price.  Kudos to Steve and team on an awesome restaurant!!  I will for certain visit again when in town for business."}
{"text":"My first experience with The Capital Grille was at their new restaurant in downtown Seattle, which has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants. So, when I saw that there was one directly across the street from my hotel in Vegas I thought \"hey, why not!\" The room wasn't ready yet anyway, and I was famished so I headed over.  Sitting at the bar, because there's no better place to meet people and have a good time in any Vegas restaurant, I ordered my newly discovered favorite appetizer - the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella. The flavor was great (it was cheese wrapped in meat after all) but the presentation was not quite up to Seattle standards. I guess maybe they don't need to try as hard because they've been around for several more years than their Seattle counterpart.  Overall the restaurant itself was very similar (surprise, it's a chain) with dark wood, brass, and paintings of famous people, most of which I don't even recognize. But it does come off a little cheesy, especially seeing that the Vegas Capital Grille is located in a mall. Oh well. At least I still have Seattle!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful and one of the best meals I have had. We went for our anniversary and thanksgiving. We started with a Caesar salad, then we both had the filet and South African lobster tail. This was to die for. I eat Maine lobster quite regularly and it doesn't even compare. For sides we split the lobster Mac and cheese and the sweet corn and bacon, I highly recommend them. Chuck Bunting was our waiter and made sure everything was perfect. He was great."}
{"text":"After sitting at our table for 30 minutes and not getting any service, we left.  But not before the hostess said thanks for coming in. Needles to say I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Amazing Food and Amazing Service. The entire staff is extremely professional and seems to care about what they do. Extensive wine selection as well. My Steak, the bone in Rib Eye, was unreal and done perfectly! Lobster Mac is out of this world and the Coconut Cream Pie is to die for. I just read Eirk P's review and it sounds to me like he is perhaps an employee of City Hall or maybe he thought he went to Capital Grille but was actually at Denny's ;-)"}
{"text":"I celebrated my 21st birthday in the one in LA and my 24th birthday in Pittsburgh in November last year (lol I know it's been so long) but I liked it.  I made a reservation and told them it's for birthday.  I walked in, the hostess was helping me to take care my coat and led us to the table that was decorated with colorful pieces.  Food and service was very good too."}
{"text":"The steaks are good/average and the atmosphere and location is great.  My favorite was the calamari appetizer that comes with red and green peppers with a unique sauce, very delicious!  It was abit pricey!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks were great as was service. We were a bit late for our reservation but they were very accommodating."}
{"text":"I've eaten here literally dozens of time over the years and it's just consistently good. Capital Grille won't surprise you with much different from time to time, but it is consistently good, and that's worth a lot. Their staff is extremely well trained, friendly but never intrusive. Rarely, if ever, have I had a meal here that doesn't leave everyone very satisfied. Great for intimate dinners or groups, excellent for lunch, too."}
{"text":"Delmonico steak is my favorite. No. 1 steakhouse for me! I love everything....atmosphere, customer service, lobster mac and cheese! Can't go wrong at Capital Grille!"}
{"text":"Having been to the Chicago location, I knew I was in for a treat.    While the steak (Delmonico 22oz)  was amazing as usual, what really stood out were the appetizers of Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarella with Vine Ripe Tomatoes, the Lobster/Crab Cakes  and the side of Lobster Mac 'N' Cheese. I would go back for these items alone.    The only problem we encountered was the empty hostess station when we arrived. Even though we made a reservation, between waiting for the hostess to appear and sitting at the bar, we had to wait about 15min for them to \"put our table together\". I was disappointed to see that when we were finally taken to the dinning room we had been seated at a booth. For a group of four guys, this isn't an ideal seating situation.   In the end, the food and wine made it easy to overlook the poor service at the hostess station. If you're out there celebrating an important event, I recommend The Capital Grille."}
{"text":"My wife, of 3 days at the time, and I were in Vegas for our honeymoon. We decided to have a romantic dinner at Capital Grille since we were already familiar with this chain restaurant. After telling them that we were in town for our honeymoon, they asked us why we were in town, we were seated right next to the window overlooking the Strip. I have a feeling that those tables are left open for honeymooning couples. The food of course is great although some of the entrees may seem a bit small portion wise. But the portion of the side dishes make up for it. Arrive at this place good and hungry if you do not want to waste any food."}
{"text":"Enjoyed great food.Being a Vegetarian, was a bit skeptical about joining my friends to a Steak House. But was pretty surprised at the vegetarian choices that they had to offer ( not on the menu). I went for a nice appetizer with freshly made goat cheese. The main course was a entree of ginger rice with some very nice veggies laced with balsamic. To all the vegetarians out there wanting to try it out - just go ahead - you won't regret it. Last but not the least Katie provided an awesome service."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic!  My wife and I had a lovely evening at the Capital Grille and will certainly return on future trips to Pittsburgh.  We had initially planned on going to Ruth's Chris, which is a personal favourite, but we were given a $50 gift card to Capital Grille which was enough to prompt us to give it a try.   The ambiance was very fine, calling to mind an era regrettably passed.  We began with a drink at the bar, and there the bartender was very helpful in taking us through the menu.  He also let us sample an excellent house martini made with pineapple and vodka.    For dinner we had a very nice Franciscan wine from Napa.  My wife had salmon and I filet mignon.  The steak was juicy and well prepared, though I must dash it ever so slightly as I had ordered it without mushrooms, which did not happen.  Our sides were mashed potatoes and cream spinach.  The spinach was particularly fine.    The service was beyond excellent - the waiters clearly take great pride in their work and execute it with pinpoint precision.  A lovely evening hopefully soon to be repeated.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"Last minute Sunday evening dinner made all the better by the excellent service we received. From front of the house to waitstaff we couldn't have been treated better. Others have done a great job reviewing the food and wines so there's no need for me to add anything there. What I will tell you is that with all due respect to CJS's May 2016 review, our experience was very different and we would highly recommend Capital Grille Scottsdale. By the way, they make one of the best Sidecar cocktails I've ever had."}
{"text":"I loved this place! We had about 15 people in our party so we had several appetizers, I particularly liked the crab cakes. The sides were served family style and there was more than enough to go around. I ordered the New York strip. It was cooked just right and the flavor was outstanding. The service was exceptional in every way. The only negative for me was it was a little loud for intimate conversation."}
{"text":"For the past 10 years, The Capital Grille has been still our all time favorite!   One can never beat the service, great classic menu and the ambience of the Phoenix/Camelback restaurant is the best!"}
{"text":"Well worth the money, even on a busy night the waiters are still very attentive to your every need. Great selection of wine, the calamari tossed in peppers was AMAZING and the lobster Mac n cheese is awesome. Highly recommend dining here if you ever visit Vegas."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for birthday dinner and we were impressed with their service. We can't comment much on the steak at this time because we couldn't taste the steak this time. But we want to praise them for their great service and professionalism. 4 stars all go to their service. Not 5 star yet because we can't comment on the steak yet.....maybe 5 stars next time after we go back again next time. Please read on for what they have done right below:   We ordered steaks but couldn't really taste it as we ordered our steak medium well, but the steak came out burned outside and rare inside. My husband's was a porterhouse, and mine was a rib-eye. my rib-eye did have a portion that is more like a medium, so I ate that part, at least still better than the steak I had earlier somewhere for lunch. My husband's porterhouse was medium on the edge, and pretty rare when it got closer to the bone. We didn't want to ask for cooking them more as the outside was very burned up (basically black). So we tried to eat the part that is more like a medium, and considered taking the rare part home, But when we got to the pretty rare part, we were still hungry and we think we couldn't handle the bloody taste anymore, it was also hard to chew on with the rareness, so we asked them to grill them some more. I guess at that point, they noticed that the steaks were burned outside and rare inside (they probably wonder why we didn't say anything earlier), and after grilling them some more, the outside got even more black and the inside was not yet medium well. So the manager came out and apologized to us very professionally and sincerely. And they said they would take care of the steaks. We were a bit surprised because we haven't experienced such kind of professionalism in restaurants for quite a long time. And they still continue to serve us sincerely after they said they would take care of the steaks. The server still kept saying happy birthday to me, and they still gave me the complimentary birthday dessert after they said they would pay for our steaks. The dessert tasted good and the presentation was good too. So at the end, there was no bill at all and we could have just walked away without paying anything. They didn't even leave a tab on the table at the end (the black thing that holds the bill when you ask for the check), meaning they are not pressuring us to leave tip. What a good ethics and attitude! In fact, we wanted to tip them even more instead because of all the good business ethics and professional service! We estimated how much the meal would have been if the steaks didn't come out wrong, then we calculate the tip off that amount. I think we gave more than 20% tip. They deserve the tip money though the steaks came out as a mistake. Since there was no tab, we gave the tip directly to the server.   There was no upsetness though the steaks were messed up. We were pleased and we think we would go back again to give it a try again in the future. Again, professionalism and service are very crucial in restaurant business. Of course good food is important too."}
{"text":"De auto's voor de deur deden me al vermoeden dat de prijzen op de menu kaart ook bedoeld waren voor mensen die geen salarisstrookje meer krijgen. Voor 2 hoofdgerechten en 2 glazen wijn mochten we inclusief fooi 150 dollar afrekenen. En om nou te zeggen dat je er iets bijzonders voor terug kreeg; niet echt dus. De irritant opdringerige ober wist de gerechten wel bijzonder te laten klinken, maar het was uiteindelijk niks meer dan een matige steak met gesmolten blauwe kaas en een boel gefrituurde uien er boven op. Tenzij je heel erg graag veel geld betaald in een zaak die meer aandacht heeft voor het interieur dan voor het eten, zou ik doorlopen naar Seasons 52 waar je beide krijgt."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience.  The location was perfect, the Chilean sea bass was cooked to perfection and the mango sorbet was the best I've had! The service was top quality and the details of our experience were completely on point.  I think the only down side was the price, bring a lot of money."}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday night.  Bar was just about full but a seat was waiting for me.  The bar tender (pedee) greeted me immediately and got me started with a drink and the menu.  I didn't really need a steak after this weekend (i know this is the capital grill) so I ordered the sea bass with shitake mushrooms.   Wow, it was really good.  It was cooked to prefection! The guy sitting next to me got truffled fries, they smelled really but I refrained from grabbing one... his burger also looked good but I was focused!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant for a perfect steak.. this is where I come for my birthday and for any time I feel like some comfort food.. From the moment you walk in, you have a feeling that all is well and that life is good..   try the kona crusted steak with the lobster mac n cheese and layonaise potatoes on the side!!!  heaven!!!!"}
{"text":"We were celebrating a birthday so they do a little extra and give you a birthday card and decorate the table with those little confetti things. They also surprised us with a free mini dessert that had a tiny cheescake and chocolate cake. Thanks! We had Andy as the server and he took the time to explain every item and cocktail and was overall very attentive. They butterflied my filet mignon since I ordered it medium-well. However, it was a little over cooked which was a bit disappointing since it cost over $40 for that 1 item, but all other food was very good. The sides like a baked potato or truffle fries are $11 each which is absurd since the cost for that is about $1, so you pay an extra $10 to be able to sit in their dining room and eat it!    The decor inside is very nice and definitely a place you want to take someone to impress them!  Would go back, but a meal for two was $200 so only visiting on special occasions."}
{"text":"This is my second time eating a CG, the first time was for lunch and I had a Rib Eye sandwich that was OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! This time was dinner and it was equally as good.  I had sole and my wife and daughter split the lamb.  Service was impeccable, food was fantastic! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This here the place fer all us political types in the state capitol (capital?) area. Heck when me broncos and I wanna get our stiff drinks and rare steaks, The Capital Grille gives us a.....................thrill! Robert Sedona usually dines here twice a week. The service is A+ and the valet is right out front. Some might say the menu prices are to high, but poor people shouldn't eat here anyhow. Cesar salads are the best in town. For a fossil like me, we like them dishes that were invented in the days of the Bible. The best food came outta ancient Rome, and the Capital Grille does ancient like Sam Fox does wine bars. Try the baked and cheesy appetizers. MMMMMMMMMMMMM! If y'all get there early fer yer 5 p.m. dinner reservation like I tend to do, sit at the bar and order a Martini. Makes me feel like one of them Njew Yorkers! For class atmosphere, tip top service, innovative food, strong spirits and more wood interior than a Lumber Liquidators storefront, Capital Grille is the spot. Huzzah! Great time! -RS"}
{"text":"Capital Grille has awesome food I'd go back.  Each time I go it takes a while to get my meal.  Other than slow service the food is excellent!"}
{"text":"Do not go unless wearing a suit...was ignored while sitting at the bar (my suit jacket was off)...as people filled in around me they were offered water and menus...I waited 15 minutes and was offered neither...total disappointment as there's so many other great places I can pay $15 for a martini for..."}
{"text":"This place is super. The decor is very nice. The staff are very professional and helpful. During our meal the managers on duty both came by to say hello and to make sure we were having a lovely time. I really enjoyed the lamb chops with a side of mushrooms and I paired it with a yummy Pinot Noir! The valet remembered my friend's name when he dropped of his car and it has been a while since he was there!! Impressive!"}
{"text":"We were (belatedly) celebrating our anniversary, and were given an excellent cozy table with celebratory decorations. Rob, our server, was very attentive but unobtrusive, and Bryce, the manager, checked on us several times. They allowed us to bring a special wine from my cellar. Spinach salad, and lobster and crab cakes both excellent. We split a 24 ounce Porterhouse, perfectly done, tender and juicy, with two sides. They readily honored a gift certificate given to us by a friend, and even comp'd us the remaining balance. We even took a fair amount of leftovers, enough for dinner tomorrow night. This was everything a special occasion dinner should be! We left looking forward to our next dinner there."}
{"text":"My first time here.  The signature cheeseburger and Parmesan truffle fries are to die for.  I love the decor and atmosphere.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the stakes and the atmosphere - a nice place to eat after shopping at the fashon mall. The service was phenomenal as well."}
{"text":"Unbelievable Thanksgiving.    This is the way to celebrate Thanksgiving -- Capital Grille style.  Starting with the best Mojitos in PHX served up by Joe (who hails from FL). The staff's usual attention to detail that exemplifies Capital Grille -- Stephanie led that parade.  Next was the calamari appetizer followed with traditional turkey dinner, and lobster mac and cheese.  My spouse had non-traditional bone in filet steak Oscar with twice baked potato.    I think we started a new tradition for Thanksgiving -- skip the work and be thankful for The Capital Grille"}
{"text":"Came here today for my last meal in Vegas and don't regret it! Easily the best meal I've had all weekend ! The view is great and ambience calm very business like dress code is probably business casual but we actually walked in with jeans and flip flops .  Our server, Miri was excellent, very nice and Served us well. She filled our waters constantly and always making sure we were ok.  I ordered the cheeseburger with truffle fries and the hubby ordered the crab/lobster burger. Both of them were heavenly!! Not sure though if it's cause I haven't eaten beef in like 2 +weeks... But I thought he burger was sook good, I only could eat half but it was defineyly juicy, tender and the bacon added tucked undernthe melted cheese added good flavor.  The truffle fries were to die for ... They came out hot and crush topped with Parmesan cheese and truffle oil... Easily one of the best fries I have ever had!! The crab burger came with some tasty tartar sauce and tasted very fresh not too breast. Mostly crab . I also had a bloody Maria which was delicious as well but would have liked to get a olive or two... overall it was a very good meal for a good price ( considering las Vegas drip coffee is almost $4 a cup) a $18 burger is about right ! Yum"}
{"text":"First, the good - the location for us is great, we usually stay at the Venetian or Palazzo, the menu has many options from dry aged steak to and seafood choices, and if you can get seated by the windows, the view is awesome.   Our most recent experience was NOT pleasant.  We made reservation for 7:30pm for Saturday.   We arrived a bit early ~ 7:15pm and were told they could seat us closer to our reservation time.  As we walked by the dining area to the bar, we did notice multiple tables that were open.  We were seated at 7:50 after having two drinks, in itself is no big deal. Everything went fine with ordering, etc, but things went astray when our food arrived.  I had ordered a filet mignon (medium rare) and my wife ordered lamb chops (medium).  My filet was cooked fine, however, my wife's lamb chops were over-cooked AND medium rare.  How they could be cooked differently, I don't know.  We waited for the server to come by but he didn't.  After a few minutes, a person came to fill our water and we asked for her to find our server.  A couple of minutes passed and she found someone else to ask what was the problem.  He noted they were not prepared correctly and took them away.  Isn't it the server's responsibility to come and check if we are satisfied with our food?  During this time, I ate about half my meal while my wife waited for her chops.  The manager (Robert Clark) did come to apologize and asked if he could take my filet and re-heat it so we could eat together.  I also asked him to take the asparagus as they were cold and had gotten wilted.  It took over 15 more minutes before our dinner came to us.  Mr. Clark brought my wife's dinner to insure it met with our expectations, which this time it was prepared as requested.  Their second most popular item should not take so long to be sent out, especially if it is for a client that has been waiting so long. The server brought us our bill and apologized.  At the end of the day what's the big deal?  I ate half my meal believing my wife's would be brought within a few minutes, but instead she waited for her entrée about 30 minutes after finishing our salads.  This is suppose to be a quality steakhouse. This was the second time this happened.  The previous time, my Delmonico steak was not prepared property and that too took an inordinate amount of time to get back my entrée.  In neither instance did we receive more than an apology, taking the entrée off the bill, free dessert, nothing.  High-quality restaurants should not only apologize for their mistakes; they should make up for them.  Last, in comparing a similar price-point establishment we have been to Delmonico's in the Venetian at least a half-dozen times and have NEVER had to send anything back.  I could only say the view won't overcome the service again."}
{"text":"We have a fabulous meal at the Capital Grille...so many options and all delicious...our only complaint is that the wine we ordered was listed as a 2008 and it arrived as a 2010..we were told that was what they had and no price difference.  It was very young..but we drank it anyway...."}
{"text":"Capital Grill = Dry Aged Steak.   Thats all you need to know.  Go there for that alone.  The rest is good, great even but its the Dry Aged Steak that makes this place and the entire chain a must eat at experience.  My girlfriend has a number of food allergies that means she can't eat spices and other things that are normal in meals to make them taste good.  So I took her here and she could not believe how good a steak without any add ons could taste.  I was the only one to drink and they have a fabulous range (best I've ever seen) of half bottle wines.  You have to specifically ask for the half bottle menu."}
{"text":"A big thank you to The Capital Grill team for making my anniversary so memorable.  Thank you for the strip view table with lovely heart confetti all over, along with the handwritten note.  Little things like that goes a long way with me and it was definitely appreciated.  Been to many steakhouses in my lifetime and I have to say, my steak wasn't the best steak I ever had, but I'm still giving this place a five star for stellar service and attention to details!"}
{"text":"Dined at the bar on a Fri night. Food was very good. Service was awful! Did receive a warm, prompt, friendly greeting, but it went downhill from there. After we ordered our 1st round of drinks, we had to beg for any additional service. I realize that the bartender had to mange a busy service bar, but the other bartender was busy waiting on a single customer and sneaking away to text. I find it unacceptable that the bartender working directly in front of us, refused to scan the bar or even make eye contact even though it was very obvious that our drinks were empty as well as or plates.Final straw was when we asked for our check. Sever delivered check, watched me place my CC in the server book and walked away to talk with her workmate. I guess her buddy was more important than her income. I rarely do this, she received a meager 10% for her very poor service."}
{"text":"My favorite place on the strip for great food.  Heather, my favorite server, is attentive and friendly.  I've been in a lot recently and Heather always remembers me and takes great care of me.  The managers are visible and the food is always spot on."}
{"text":"Reservations were running behind on Valentine's Day, but we managed to snag a seat at the bar while we waited. It took 20 minutes to get a drink from the bartender. By the time we got our drinks, our table was ready. The service was great. We started with smoked salmon as an appetizer, which we enjoyed. The lobster bisque was delicious. It took a long time for our entrees to come out. I understand the kitchen was probably slammed because of Valentine's Day, but other tables were getting their entrees much faster than we were. One steak was over cooked (ordered medium rare plus and delivered closer to medium well) and the other was under cooked (ordered medium rare plus and delivered medium rare to rare). The only flavor the steak had was the char on the outside, and I was disappointed to learn that their steaks aren't even prime! They are choice steaks! We added a lobster tale on the side which was good but a bit over cooked. The lobster Mac and cheese was great."}
{"text":"One of the best steakhouses I've ever been to. The quality of the food is the best in the business, and our server was knowledgeable about everything on the menu, including the color of the beef we would get based on how we wanted it done. Great service speed as well. It is expensive, but anything that's the best of the best is expensive."}
{"text":"I'm staying at the trump international so after a walk through the mall across the street I found my self wanting to eat a nice steak dinner. First time I've been to capital grille and I can say I was very impressed, I had the filet mignon with the asparagus and a glass of the house red wine and it was all amazing. Unfortunately I didn't have the appetite for desert when it was all said and done. The service was very good even though I sat at the bar so I could watch tv I still felt like a very prioritized customer by the guy behind the bar. A bit pricey but It was well worth it for my steak was grilled to perfection and I have no complaints. Oh there was some obnoxious \"millionaires\" bragging about their Ferraris and houses but It was nothing to me because I was so focused on my food!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. The steak was well seasoned and cooked to perfection. Lobster Mac and Cheese was creamy and flavorful. The truffle fries were crispy and spiced well. They made a special birthday even more special with a card and dessert. Our waiter and servers were perfect. Attentive but not obtrusive. The wine selection was massive and the prices very reasonable. We selected a wonderful and rare Greek red. The ambiance is wonderful and most tables have a great view. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My Husband & I had dinner at the Scottsdale location Saturday night Valentines Day weekend.  The place was packed and like always the food & service was exceptional!!!!  The best part is we got to see James the manager who we had met in Vegas Capital Grille las year (he told us he was moving to Phx).  We also had the pleasure to speak with Brian another manager who we met before, then we got to meet Sabrina the 3rd manager on duty that night.  We told them how well their whole staff works, every single one of them were working hard.  Actually we even saw the managers clearing tables & serving meals.  The food was fabulous again, cooked to perfection and served nice an hot.  I always get the chicken dish, my Husband had the seared tenderloin with lobster tails. Sides were grilled asparagus & fingerling potatoes.  Love those potatoes!!!!  Again both meals were exceptional!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!!! We have been going here twice a year for a few years now. Love sitting by the window with a view of the strip.  The Food & Service has always been awesome!  We ask to be seated with Frankie from Philly he is a professional, funny and awesome waiter.  My Husband always gets the Oysters & I a salad for appetizers.  As for the entree my husband always gets a steak (always tries different ones) as for me I always get the chicken Entree.  Over the past several years they have changed the Chicken  dish but they never disappoint it is always moist and delicious.  The grilled Asparagus is to die for.  Wine selection is fantastic!!!!!  Looking forward to our next visit to Vegas an another exceptional meal at The Capital Grill!!!"}
{"text":"First time dining there last night with a group of coworkers and their guests. We went early since these kind of dinners always take awhile. Our server Terry was very knowledgeable and accommodating. Being a vegetarian, he was especially kind to me and saw to it that I was taken care with recommendations.  I had the shaved brussel sprouts salad minus the bacon as an entree: great flavor and texture, but a bit over dressed. The group shared several sides including: mashed potatoes, so creamy and rich Asparagus, a little oily and with charred tips Golden beets with goat cheese, sweet and delicate And of course the lobster Mac n cheese, which I did not have but heard was excellent We took dessert to go: I chose the coconut cream pie, we were told it is a top seller. Big enough for two. Sweet and creamy with a crunchy coconut crisp, so delicious A wonderful evening"}
{"text":"We were staying at the Wynn Hotel and decided try this restaurant after watching the 7 PM La Reve show. The restaurant is located at the Fashion Show Mall just across the hotel. We pick this restaurant based on the recommendation of Yelp and Open table. Reservation was done through Open Table.  The place is elegant with dark wood paneling all around. It is located at the third floor corner of the building fronting the Las Vegas Strip and the view is gorgeous.  My wife and I both ordered the Bone-in Kona Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin and shared a wedge salad. We also ordered fresh creme spinach and Vidalia onion rings for our side.   Overall, the service is very attentive and good. The ambiance is great. The portions are big and more than enough even if you are starving.The steak is comparable with the other good higher end steakhouses. I still prefers Mastro's but will not hesitate to come back nor recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have dined at the Biltmore location, and always enjoyed it, but drifted to the variety of fine dining spots in N Scottsdale in the interim. After a few mediocre experiences at these other places, we decided to try the Capital Grille in Scottsdale - it was a perfect meal!  The check-in was very pleasant,and handled quickly on a very busy evening. Giovanni took great care of us (attentive but non-intrusive service), and we never had to wait long for anything! The menu has so many tasty options, and  the dishes we ordered were prepared to perfection (and I am a bit picky!!). Kudos to the staff, the Chefs, and the management - they all clearly take pride in what they do!"}
{"text":"Great dinner tonight with good friends. Lobster bisque, crab and lobster cakes with an added lobster tail, filet and lobster for my husband. Good wine. Richest carrot cake."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Service is world-class. Love the Bar. Great people! A hidden Vegas gem..."}
{"text":"foods good , service is poor and pretentious . servers are doing you a favor by taking your order . not going back ."}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING food, and even better service!!!! The spicy calamari appetizer dish is to die for! Most amazing flavor... Everything they have here is truly one of a kind! You won't ever be disappointed !!"}
{"text":"Disappointing experience at the grill. Two of our groups 4 steaks were not cooked correctly, waiter was not at all knowledgable about wines leading to a well below experience.  Obviously the prices were still the same.  It will be some time before I return if at all"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the service and the ambience, and my husband raved about everything, from the fresh bread to his steak. My steak was okay, it was fairly undercooked in the middle but the outside was charred- not my favorite. Plus I added the Gorgonzola cheese with wine sauce and I wasn't impressed. Also, the lobster mac n' cheese wasn't super tasty either.   I wouldn't mind going back, but for a substantial check like that I expect my tastebuds to be more satisfied!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and excellent service. LOVED the porcini rubbed delmonico."}
{"text":"Just got back from dinner here.  Have to say the whole experience was awesome.  We showed up without reservation yet they were able to seat us right away.  Had the aged Porter house and Lobster mac and cheese.  Was one of best steaks I have ever had.  The mac and cheese was light and had lots of lobster chunks.  Our waiter, Chris Garcia was exceptional.  We will be back and have recommended it to my friends.  AWESOME place"}
{"text":"Could not be sadder to post this review.  We ate here tonight for my birthday. We had a 13yr old, a senior and 2 middle aged folks.   Senior and 13yr old order from the $39 menu and we ordered a couple of wonderful Delmonicos like we always do.   Our steaks were great. The others were horrible. The senior did not want to send it back because she just isn't that way. The Childs needed to go back. It was dry and tough and horribly over flavored with Morrells.   By the time her replacement dish came we were all done and ready for dessert. Waitress just said \"I'll just wrap it up\". What like she shouldn't eat?!!?  Anyway long story short is it was horrible service and they did not even offer to remove one of the awful meals.   Very disappointed in Capital Grille. This location anyway. The one in Ft Lauderdale was always great. The North Scottsdale one ruined my birthday and failed with terrible service and an absent manager.  Booo!  Since this is our neighborhood Capital Grille I would assume eventually we will have to try it again another day and I hope to god come back here and edit this review."}
{"text":"kona rubbed steak and a bottle of Jordan Cab. tough to beat.   Place is a little dark....otherwise a great steakhouse."}
{"text":"Went here for a business dinner with vendors on a Wed. night and the server could not have been more rude. Two of us got steak and lobster, instead of med-rare like we asked, we both ended up with med-well. We tried to send them back but the server was no where to be found. We finally had to get the busser to assist us. Busser was great,  but the manager who came out had a real whatever attitude about it. Our initial waiter returned without saying a word, cleared our glasses of water and then stormed off w/o saying a word. He then threw hostile looks over at us, it was extremely awkward. Then they pulled him from our table and another waiter took his place. It was a big let down."}
{"text":"Outstanding NY strip, Med Rare and perfect. Great business meal with clients ans superb service. Tremendous wine list as you'd expect for a Vegas steak house.   Cap Grille never disappoints.   Date of visit. Jan 7 2016."}
{"text":"What a classy spot. We took a couple here to celebrate their anniversary. It could not have been a better choice. The room is beautifully appointed with celeb portraits. We were seated by a window with a great view. Rose petals decorated the table. Four of us were served sparkling wine (gratis), and the celebrants were presented with a card. We  dined on chowder and French onion soup with our assortment of fresh breads. The salmon was moist and tender; swordfish delicate and flavorful. Four generous lamb chops and filet rounded out our varied selections. We   shared fantastic au gratin potatoes and creamed spinach. Then the  waiter brought a dessert platter for the anniversary couple which they  shared after extinguishing the candles. We loved the light cheesecake,  chocolate cake, and berries with our coffee. Dessert was also comped.  Wonderful service was provided throughout. Minor criticism: coffee was a  bit weak. This is top notch dining and well worth the price."}
{"text":"I have been to The capital Grille in the past, but this one in particular was exceptional. the food and service are expected, but what made the experience was my server Charles Corrieri. he was oustanding. he took the time to review the day menu options and guide me thru the menu. He recommended the asparagus citrus bisque, which I have to say was absolutely amazing. I was well cared for as I dined solo. I highly recommend dining here during your stay in Vegas as a fine dining experience. the chef offered a note to me as well. I thought it was a nice gesture. I will be back and sure to ask for my favorite server Charles."}
{"text":"The good:  Mac and cheese was perfect Easy valet parking Manager tried to rectify a bad situation Citrus salmon was perfectly done  The bad:  The chopped salad was drenched in dressing and the lettuce pieces were huge.  The service - the staff seemed busy with larger parties and we were an afterthought.  The salad plate wasn't cleared before steaks came... Made for a crowded table.  We asked for our wine to be served with dinner and we had to ask for it after the food came out (next time we will just ask for it right away!)  One of our 4 wasn't happy with the color of his steak...(I find the interpretation of rare/medium/well varies) After a send back the color was better but the steak was covered in a liquid... They said it was au jus but the first steak didn't have it...the manager was kind enough to take it off the bill...the other two steaks were above average but not as good as we were expecting.  I wanted to like this steakhouse - there is one down the street from me in DC and I had heard good things.  The steak and service didn't justify the price and hype.  I would travel to Arlington or East of the River to have Ray's instead."}
{"text":"My family visited for my son's 30th birthday. The table was decorated and a card signed by all the employees addressed to my son was at his spot. The food was perfect from the lobster bisque to the trio of ice cream. It's a favorite place of ours."}
{"text":"OK, so I Yelp on a curve.  My expectations of quality, technique, ambiance, flavor, service, seasoning, skill, knowledge, presentation and value are directly proportionate to the dollars spent and the locality in which it is enjoyed.   I can not apply the same degree of criticism at Torchy's for $10 as I do at Per Se for $500 ... although they both deserve 5 stars based on the above criteria.  This brings me to The Capital Grille in Charlotte....    Design and decor get high ratings for the old school, old boys steak house feel. However more modern interpretations like Houston's/Hillstone or J.Alexander's score higher and feel better.   The service was knowledgeable, but rushed, and not attentive.Not bad in any way but not what I would expect from a place that seems so polished, pretentious and more importantly so expensive. Lets just say I have had much better service for half the price... ( recently Acme in Chapel Hill but I have yet to get to that review)  Food ... OK $40 an entree  ala carte, $10 sides, those are NYC, LA, SF  prices. I expect it to be of comparable quality...... Sadly it was not.    The menu list \"daily seafood feature\", when I asked it was, I was told filet(beef) medallions with scallops .... sorry Chef .... that may feature seafood, but it is not a \"seafood feature\" !    Between the 2 of us we had -   Cedar Plank salmon, slightly over cooked, vastly under seasoned ( my better half rarely salts anything she did this)  Bone in NY ordered mid-rare, received very much on the rare side, slightly cold, flavor was good, but undercooked and served with a slightly roasted shallot that was still crunchy (not cooked enough), not the sweet, soft, unctuousness that it could have been.  Potato gratin ( $10) needed an extra 15 min. in the oven, the potatoes were not cooked through... and there was a very very strong raw garlic flavor, AND there was plastic wrap inside ! .. In fairness I understand this happens occasionally and it and the dessert were comped, however I see a trend of sloppiness with the food that should not be happening at this price point.  Grilled Asparagus ($10) it was ok ... but just ok.   Dessert creme brule, ......nothing special...  thin  not very crisp carmel, made worse by too many wet berries, and a strawberry fan garnish which even in the darkly lit dining room (as opposed to the kitchen) I could see was past its prime.  it was a $50 dinner for more than $150, so I think that   \"Meh. I've experienced better\" sums it up ............ 2 stars"}
{"text":"At the grills bar and waited for service for along time. I understand it was a busy time. Everyone had their drinks and water. I had none of them. The bartender took my order and proceeded to serve everyone else. Water too.  I had no water. She finally looked at me and saw my disappointment and didn't say a word. I go there frequently and find the quality of the new bartenders is amazingly LACKING.  I called management. I don't think they care."}
{"text":"Just had one of the absolute best meal experiences in recent memory. I had the filet with shallot butter glaze......cooked to perfection, extremely tender and flavorful! Kelly, our server, was knowledgable, professional,  efficient and friendly.  Just a great meal, great service and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Being a French onion soup addict, I have tried it everywhere in Vegas that I have been to that serves it. This has been the most consistent all around. It is savory, nutty, the bread and cheese both hold their consistency the way they're supposed to. Also, if you happen to sit at the bar, Pam, one of the bartenders, is AMAZING. She remembers us from the second time we went there and always takes the best care of us! We love you Pam!!  The other food is amazing as well, by the way, but the soup is a must!"}
{"text":"Our dinner there was delightful. I was pleasantly surprised since it is a chain steakhouse. I expected good steak but it was quite well rounded. We were seated almost immediately at 7pm on a Sunday night. The server was very nice and answered alot of pointed questions about the menu and content. We both have dietary restrictions so we definitely put him through his paces. He never got frustrated with us even though we shared a few things. We both got salads. Mine was the chopped salad and was delightful. Then I got the filet mignon medium rare and my friend got the lobster tail. Mine was cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious. Sometimes simple is really best. Thank heavens the steak was way too much meat for me to eat so I didn't have to glare  piercingly at the basket of fresh warm rolls for long. Even so I'm relatively certain they turned to yucky charcoal under my gaze. We were too full to even complain about not getting to order dessert. I took the steak home for a yummy lunch the next day and all was well. Of course we got up to leave and I promptly left the steak at the table....I ran out front and by the time I got back to the table it was whisked away. But all the while they were chasing me down trying to give it too me. I thought that was a nice extra step. Even with the plethora of classic steakhouses out there...I would still go to Capital Grille again if the opportunity and desire arouse."}
{"text":"It is nice not to have to go through a Casino full of smoke to get to an upscale restaurant.  There is easy access parking and even valet..  The food was exceptional and our waitress was wonderful.  The view is nice and the restaurant feels very posh without being stuffy.  We will return."}
{"text":"Searched yelp all the reviews for the best of steak & lobster and we selected The Capital Grille and was not disappointed.  It was our anniversary and my husband's 65th B-Day and was pleasantly surprised with complementry champagne.  We had the prosciutto wrapped  mozzarella, filet  mignonette Oscar, 2 lb lobster tail de -shelled, and the sautéed spinach.  The spinach was a little blain but everything else was fantastic.  For desert my husband had the cream brûlée and I had the flourless chocolate cake both excellent.  The service was fantastic a call out to our waiter Jason Sherry for a wonderful dinning experience."}
{"text":"Dinner Sunday evening was amazing. I started with the French Onion soup and then the Delmonico steak. Each was excellent. The perfect finish for me was the Cheesecake which was smooth and creamy like I prefer. Ralph was our attentive and engaging waiter and the manager Matt stopped by to ensure our experience was top notch which it was.  We are looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"This place has a good happy hour . Burger pair with wine $25.00. We went there for my fiancée birthday."}
{"text":"Lots of buzz about The Capital Grille...Had dinner there tonight and although it probably isn't suited for the veggies, I still had plenty of delicious items to nosh on.  Started off with the bread basket - there were a varieties of breads, I chose the pumpernickel with raisins, it was soft and fresh.    Next, I opted to go with light fare for dinner:  1. Chopped Salad - romaine and iceberg lettuces, corn, asparagus tips, artichoke hearts, tomatoes, crunchy parmesan croutons, all served with a side of house made ranch...Fresh and lovely. 2. Truffle Fries w/ parmesan - Oh yeah, baby!  In conclusion, I thought my dinner was excellent...Furthermore, if I could ever be tempted out of being a veggie by some delectable piece of meat, I honestly believe that a dry aged steak at The Capital Grille would be a prime candidate.  P.S. Our waiter was a sweetheart."}
{"text":"The hubby brought me here for our Anniversary dinner. I loved the dim lighting and the nice Anniversary table layout they had for us. The mignon was very good and not to mention the complimentary dessert to help celebrate our special day. It was lovely."}
{"text":"::slurp slurp::  Deliciousness.  Even if you never have the food here, the pineapple Stoli martini is indescribable. Hence, my description: slurp slurp. That's all one could hear. Ahhhh...  On a serious note, the Stoli Vodka is infused for weeks with pineapple, then iced, and...voila....the Pineapple Stoli Martini is ready. Sometimes, simplicity makes for the best cocktails. Sure you can jump through hoops and do a backflip (which would be entertaining), but it doesn't mean it is worth it for me to test my taste buds.  The food here is awesome as well. We had the truffle fries, clam chowder, chopped salad and the crab and lobster cakes. All were delicious!   A little less delicious? The prices. BUT...that is to be expected with some places, the Capital Grille being one of them.  The service was outstanding. It better be!  My meal of choice at the Capital Grille: two Pineapple Stoli Martinis and their bread. Sold and done. Next, please roll me outside, chauffeur me home and tuck me in! Thanks."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Capital Grille all across the States.  I have eaten at this location a number of times including two times this week.  Sarah, Kevin and Methune are fantastic.  The food is always top notch including the new menu items.  Tonight, Sarah provided exceptional service and charm that added value to my experience.  Kevin and Methune also provided quality service earlier this week.  Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is exceptional, the atmosphere, the service, the food. We had a party of 15 and they were accommodating. I had a delicious berry cocktail, the lobster mac n cheese, a bowl of French onion soup topped off with fresh onion bread. All of that and my bill was $42! Not bad for a nice place like this. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place was ok, not good, not bad, but ok.For the price it should have been kick-ass.   I went here couple weeks ago with a friend and while the service was attentive it was borderline annoying.I can get my own calamari, you don't need to serve me when you don't have gloved hands. Ugh just let me do it please? If I dont eat everything, Its not that the food inst good its just i will finish eating and stop eating. If my friend and I haven't eaten anything in 5 mins it means WERE DONE. thanks  The food was fine. Its nothing I haven't seen anywhere else. For an appetizer we had the pan-fried calamari. It was okay, the wrapped lemon was a cute touch but i mean honesty the calamari was too battered and not crisp enough. For an entree I had the Sushi grade tuna. It was cooked perfectly. THe sauces were fun but not one that i completely loved. I had a side of assperagus and it was amazing. I always seem to get the overcooked asperagus but this time they were perfect and served with hollandaise.   I dont think for the price I would come back. Not worth it but I guess this place is perfect for those who wanna flaunt money"}
{"text":"If there were 6 stars I could leave I would. We have a Capital Grill back home in Chicago but have never visited. I had the lamb chops and my wife had the filet. We both split the gratin potatoes since the side portions are so big(recommendation of our server) and I'll say the best lamb chop I have ever had. Cooked perfectly and a very large portion, 4 large chops. I took our server's recommendation and tried their balsamic to drizzle over he chop and was delicious. My wife's filet was also very good, of course I had to try it. Not the best filet I have had but still worth every penny. Drinks were well prepared and tasty. If you have room for desert hands down get the cheesecake! I'll let it speak for itself. Server was great and very helpful with the menu."}
{"text":"It was the reason to use Yelp.  Last winter my family went to Vegas. One day we were shopping in the fashion show, my mom wanted to have some steak for dinner. So I yelped and found this grille had the highest rate. The view was very nice.  The steak there were tasty. My father ordered lamb and I tried a little bit. They are so good. Definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"Jim was our server. Ask for him when you come. He made the night great. Excellent wine list and the coconut cream pie is the best dessert you will ever have. Worthy every yummy calorie.  We went for dinner, but have also been for lunch. Lobster bisque is great and enjoyed the spinach salad (has a warm bacon dressing) traditional yummy steak house fare served here. But seriously, try the coconut cream pie."}
{"text":"Food was ok but I was disappointed for the price I was paying.  Maybe my expectations were too high but when I see the menu and description, I am expecting perfection in a steak and I was disappointed.  Wait staff was attentive but not overly friendly.  I will probably go elsewhere for a high end meal in the future."}
{"text":"My Wife had read that the bar at the Capital Grille had a good menu and after checking the reviews it appeared to be a good choice. We went to the restaurant and were greeted by a very attentive hostess who immediately began to seat us. We asked if we could sit in the bar and she said yes and seated us in the bar.  the bar was empty as the restaurant had just opened however there was a bartender there preparing for the day. She greeted us very nicely and brought us the menus. She then explained the various items on the menu that we asked about and then took our orders. As she was leaving my wife made a comment to me about my birthday however I did not know the bartender had heard the comment.  The bartender then brought us our wine and appetizer which was incredible. We tried the Ahi Tuna Sashimi which was incredible. After that we had the Capital Grille Burger and truffle fries which was also incredible. For desert we had the flourless chocolate cake and once again it was incredible, especially with a glass of port.  After a great meal the check was delivered to us at which time the bartender said that it was my Birthday and that they recognize this and provided our appetizer and the desert at no charge; what a wonderful thing to hear.   We had a great time, great food, great wine and outstanding service. We will be back."}
{"text":"Still the best steak i have ever had.  Amazing every time Im here.  Pricey but worth it"}
{"text":"We had a really nice experience. Our server was Monica and she was so helpful. She gave great recommendations on the menu. The atmosphere and the food was great . We left there happy and full... Whenever we go to Vegas we will definitely go  to Capital Grille again."}
{"text":"Capital Grill is Classy Vegas with spectacular service. The quality of food is Great, although a bit on the pricey side but well worth the experience."}
{"text":"It's an exquisite establishment from all points of view: location, atmosphere/decor, service, and of course, menu! Catering to the most discriminate palate, we are not only treating ourselves there, but take pleasure in taking along our local and out of town friends, in the knowledge that it will not disappoint...and it never did! The staff is friendly and knowledgeable in both, the individual menu items as well as the well assorted wine list. And (as even in the best places in the world!) the inevitable gaffe happens, Stacey Urbin (the manager) is there to step in with prompt, impeccable professionalism and everything is taken care of in an elegant and distinguished manner befitting the establishment! A place catering to the most refined taste(s), sure not to disappoint under any aspect!"}
{"text":"Came here for a coworkers fancy birthday dinner. We had a party of 14 and they were able to cater to us with excellent service and class. Not only did they have great service, but the food was amazing. I ordered the filet mignon (rare) and it melted like butter in my mouth. The lobster mac n' cheese was also very delicious. A lot of delectable choices for wine as well.  It's at a great location in Uptown Charlotte which allowed us to walk to the bars/clubs after dinner."}
{"text":"Awesome service by Alex. Better pricing than casinos too.  Wait was 30 min past reservation however"}
{"text":"Do Not miss out on the rib eye sandwich!! Incredible taste and tenderness! Beautiful restaurant and service outstanding.. I had a salad with shrimp, sounds like I should have had the wedge. Anyway, nice place, tough parking. But just a tourist so not too concerned about that. I did hear from our server however they may be opening one in Costa Mesa CA?? Hope so. Enjoy  Stars for the Sandwich and service. Not crazy about the salad a little pricey for so so salad."}
{"text":"The ambiance was great. Food awesome. Service the best and super friendly. But it was very expensive. We paid  $300+ per couple with a drink before dinner, appetizers and main course. One bottle of $60 wine. No dessert."}
{"text":"An amazing evening and restaurant....Capital Grille was perfection at its finest!  Ken Fauth provided flawless service, and his suggestions were perfect!   The restaurant greeted us with warmth and made our 17th Anniversary truly memorable and enjoyable!  Thank you Capital Grille and Ken!!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed our impromptu date night here. I had never been to Capital before and my husband and I each ordered the Porterhouse which did not disappoint. The scalloped potatoes and brussel sprouts were a good addition and came with more than enough for two people to share, superb side dishes! Rebecca our server was informative and courteous. I come to expect a level of professionalism when paying a considerable amount for a meal and unfortunately the experience was just not up to par on the prices they command in that ice teas were brought initially and then never refilled after the meal had started. A bottle of wine would have likely been ordered had we been checked on until after our meal was finished but we were not. In using the restroom I did find servers and hostesses that were in the customer bathroom complaining about whos got whos tables which just left a really bad impression. I just feel like the overall experience based upon these occurrences left a bad taste in my mouth, a finer dining experience should behold a level of professionalism that was just not delivered."}
{"text":"I love how the staff treat you like royalty whenever you go to the Capital Grille.  I went with the 24 ounce Porthouse steak, medium rare.  It was cooked more on the rare side, but that was more than OK with me as the steak was one of the best I've ever had.  The coconut cream pie was a total bust, however.  Avoid that like the plague (I've had much better even at a place like Eat n Park).  The terrible dessert is not enough to keep me from coming back, however.  I'm already looking forward to the next visit."}
{"text":"We rented out the outside patio for my wedding reception. The service was fantastic, the food delicious and the wine, superb. We requested a champagne toast and passed hors d'oeuvres to begin the evening, and was not disappointed to walk in and have a glass of champagne waiting for me. All of our guests had a lovely time. My only two issues were simply that I wish we had had a bit more time during the cocktail portion to mingle; also the lights on the trees just outside the patio were not lit, which I had requested. Nonetheless, these were minor issues and the evening went off without a true hitch!"}
{"text":"Went back to Capital Grille in early May and had another wonderful time. We dined in the Bar area so that we could Watch the NHL Playoffs as well as NFL draft. The Bar Tender took care of us and Ralph my waiter from my last visit dropped in to say Hello. The Sirlion was tender and full of flavor. The Hazelnut cake a great cap to a great diner. This places not only delivers a great meal but the service is the best."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal at Capital Grill and this location is no exception. I've been to this location several times however, this was my first visit for lunch. I had the Chilean Sea Bass. The portion was large for lunch but very tasty. My only critique would be too much broth in the bowl and it turned soupy, otherwise great. I thought because it was lunch time and 11:15AM  I'd be able to find a parking space. No way. Just valet park and save yourself the time. Overall great experience, the server was extremely kind, knowledgeable and pleasant."}
{"text":"Voted the best Steakhouse in PGH for a reason.   Good Downtown location, valet service, solid wine list, the lobster bisque is absolutely incredible, Filet Oscar done to perfection. Need I say more  The creepy picture of Fred Rogers right behind me in the dining room almost made this a 4 star. But I suppose I can't hold that against them ;)"}
{"text":"FABULOUS!!  Visited the Capital Grille for dinner on New Year's Eve and was extremely impressed with the atmosphere, wait staff and the food was just plain amazing.  I devoured the huge portion of lobster and crab stuffed shrimp.  Our sides were mashed potatos and asparagus with hollandaise...both were great.  Our bill was $209 for 4 people...some may think its a little pricey but I think it was well worth it and would certainly do it all over again with no hesitation.  The one and only complaint I have is that the menus are HUGE....huge to the point that I nearly cleared all of the glasses off the table when attempting to order...BUT food that great deserves to be displayed on a small billboard!"}
{"text":"We came here once for the Mothers Day brunch and were really, really wowed by the indescribably delicious food and impeccable service. Everything -- every single detail was flawless.  The prime rib and the lobster eggs benedict just sent us swooning, and that was before we hit the desserts.  Fabulous restaurant, and I'm hoping my sons will take me there again.  It's awfully pricey for their wallets, so maybe not.  But if your budget allows it, this is one terrific place to dine."}
{"text":"Hit The Capital Grille while in Vegas for my good friends 50th! We had a group of 16 that grew to 19 and the staff was awesome! Great service and fair price for great food right on the strip where all other places wanted to charge crazy prices for a group this large. Awesome service and all the food came out quick and together!!!!"}
{"text":"The joke in our household is, forget Disney, this is my happiest place on earth haha. My husband always knows this is a slam dunk, home run, ultimate wife pleaser treat.  We are sort of stuck in our traditional menu choices so can't speak for experiencing everything on the menu. Our go to delights are always the bone in ribeyes (Oscar style for me, plain for hubby), calamari and lobster Mac. We've had other sides and all have been good and others in our group have enjoyed various other entrees, all have been good. I just seem to stick to my same old favorite, stomp my feet and want to cry ultimate bites. I know it's ridiculous that I have this relationship with this particular meal.   We have celebrated many special occasions here (over the years since it opened) and the staff has always made every effort to acknowledge our event. I feel the service is always on point regardless of our occasion (or none at all) and even if we've had kids and grandkids with. They pay attention to detail and accommodate requests and often even seat us with our favorite servers upon request or by chance.   It's a very upscale restaurant that offers high end food and prices comparable to other restaurants on the same level and they deliver an experience that reflects what you pay for. We notice all kinds of customer combinations from families, dates, older, younger, formally dressed to resort casual and casual and every customer is equally attended to. Sometimes people might be out or coming from somewhere and not all dressed up but don't let that stop you from going.  Heck I will do the walk of shame in shorts and flip flops to get my ribeye if I have to haha. Nothing can be absolutely perfect all the time but this place is consistently darn near. In the rare event something is off, they are Lightening quick to re-fire or offer another option to give their customers the experience they look forward to and expect. They care about their customers and the combination of their long term staff and repeat customers creates a warm and friendly rapport that you look forward to and appreciate when you come in.   We've been in on some holidays when it's crazy busy (like Mother's Day and Valentine's Day) and it can be a little more hectic but food has still been on point. We didn't feel rushed or neglected and have never been made to feel uncomfortable asking for something we needed or sharing a concern if something was off. We've brought family from out of town who come from the land of beef (hard core steak snobs) and even they have said \"wow this was the best steak they've ever had\". Not sure if we are supposed to compare to other restaurants in our review but in my honest opinion CG blows Flemings, Morton's and Ruth Chris away. We cheat once in a while at other places just to check them out and always regret it and spend our dinner comparing it to CG. Oh and I'm always too full (always have leftovers) but try hard to make room for a couple bites of their delicious sorbet when they have my favorite flavors."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for Valentine's dinner. Food was terrific and the service was excellent. We had an amazing night.   Starting with the fresh oysters, they are so fresh that I can taste the ocean. My husband doesn't like raw food but he ate 3. With that kind of quality for only $18 for half dozen, it's totally worth the price.   Calamari was crisp. I was surprised it can be tasted that good with the hot peppers. Must try!  Steak tartare, a little bit dry but not too bad. I had better :)  Lobster crab cakes, not too special. $20 for only 2 pieces, I think you can skip it.     We had the rib eye for main course, and the steak cooked to perfection with the fries on the side. One of the best steaks in town.  Also like their wine list. We ordered half bottle of red wine and it's enough for 2.  5 starts!! Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"It was a bit busier so we had to wait a little longer for our appetizer and initial drinks, but then each course came at a good pace.   Our server, Greg, was super friendly and very sweet and helpful with wine pairings!     The steaks were juicy and literally do melt in your mouth.  The Gorgonzola Porcini Rubbed Sirloin was very flavorful and has a great Cabernet Reduction with it - delicious!!   The Cheesecake is Creme Brule style but delicious!  A good portion for 2 people, rich but delicious!!   Wines are perfectly matched with the food, could be a slightly bigger portion but they were excellent."}
{"text":"Our host Dan (Daniel) is great in guiding us through the menu. We had Porterhouse, Scallops, and wild mushroom.  We are definitely going back for Christmas."}
{"text":"We went there last night. What a waste! The salads came out fine but we waited about 45 minutes for steak and asparagus. How long does it take to grill a steak? Sorry but we won't be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed a fabulous dinner in the bar. We ordered from the bar menu . The shrimp in the skillet was described perfectly by our waiter Nathan(who was terrific) and it was delicious. So was the lobster Mac and cheese. The staff was very attentive so the service was superb and so was the food."}
{"text":"I am a steakhouse regular.  It is the only food I really like and so I know what to expect for what kind of money.  This place is not worth the money.  I am not saying they are over priced...the area, the clientele and the overall perception of the place warrants a higher priced dining experience...what I am saying is Capital Grille does not belong in this arena.    The visit was disappointing at best.  My husband and I showed 15 minutes early and got seated quickly...good!    We ordered a drink and when they arrived ordered app.'s and entree's at the same time.  We had some bread with our drinks while waiting for app.'s...the table got \"crumby\" and you would expect that in this type of restaurant they would pull out their handy-dandy table scrappers...nope...I just kept sweeping it to the egde...whatever!  As a matter if fact, no one attempted to clear glasses, plates...I had to make eye contact with them and kind of \"offer\" to give them what I wanted off the table...HORRIBLE!!!    So, the app.'s arrive and they are sub standard...I ordered a capese like app. (Beefsteak Tomato -Mozzarella cheese- Basil)..the point is the Tomato...they're the point of the dish...they were Green and not even close to ripe..ok...whatever...I eat around it basically.  My husband had Oysters...no crackers and had to beg for Tabasco...ok...we move forward...1 full hour went by before our server finally said they were having trouble in the kitchen...could they buy us a drink to tide us over.  I said no but only because we were headed for drinks afterwards and I really didn't want to end up wasted.  5 minutes later...he shows with drinks and says they are compliments of the manager as they know we have been waiting.  At this point my husband and I are not off the wall pissed but we're getting tired of sitting there and are hungry to boot...now add more alcohol.....DISASTER!  So, food finally arrives..I ordered the filet medium well...came Red...didn't bother to send it back...ate half and called it a day.  My husband ordered the Ribeye...it was just plain fat.  Now, it is a steak that needs fat to taste as good as it does...but this, again, was sub standard.  He had to cut awat 1/2 of it to get to decent meat!   Here comes the kicker...  We pay our bill and get out of there (no manager ever came to the table to apologize for the crap visit)...  We go to the bar that we were meeting people at and my husband starts to feel \"funky\" and not in a good way!!  He was telling the people in our party about Capital Grille when one of them says. \"I should have called Health and Sanitation on them last time I was there...I got food poisioning from my dinner\".  That was it...!!  We ended up leaving and going home where my husband proceeded to get sick...ALL NIGHT LONG!!!  Horrible visit ...terribly disappointing...and obviously charging way too much money for sub standard food...!  It was like a bait and switch with out the actual advertising how high end the meat is...its assumed that its higher end at $40-$50 a piece...well not by me.  DONE!  Wouldn't go back here for FREE!!!!!  We have always been fans of Mastro's Steakhouse and only went here because someone gave us a gift certificate...WE\"RE STICKING WITH MASTRO'S...You get what you pay for there and EVERYTHING IS A PLUS-TOP OF THE LINE!!"}
{"text":"A great experience!  Mixed drinks were great and true to the descriptions in their iPad menu.  The tuna tar-tar and the calamari was spot on. Tuna was super fresh and calamari was light and satisfying.  Steak choices were amazing with all different cuts prepped in many different ways.. desert choices were great and delicious.  Chocolate lava cake was amazing and the coconut cream pie was phenomenal.   The best part of the dining experience was one of the best servers we have ever had at any kind of restaurant..Ricky Reyes, our server was amazing. Attentive and accommodating.  Always nearby where he brought us everything we needed..  when we go back.. we will be asking for him specifically.  I highly recommend capital rille for a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Debated a while between 4-5 stars.  Went on a weeknight for a business diner.  There was 3 of us, we ordered the shrimp cocktail and all had wedge salads that were very good.  I had the Delmonaco bone in ribeye, and they both had filet.  It was a good steak but  $45 seems a bit much for a steak with nothing else.  We also had asparagus and au gratin potatoes - the potatoes were just OK - I like mine more cheezy and these were very creamy with bread crumbs on top that I didn't really care for.  The service was outstanding.  We all had a few drinks - bonus that they have Dogfish Head IPA and I'm sure the bill was over $300 but luckily for me, I didn't have to pay."}
{"text":"While one of the best steaks I have ever eaten was in a cowboy bar outside of Dallas where there were more teeth on the floor than in the average patron's mouth. I have come to believe that most of us generally desire that unique union of a robust menu composed of carefully planned and executed dishes with a splash of unique drinks, a dazzling wine selection, excellent service that offer suggestions to round out a dining experience, and finally an atmosphere that lets us focus on our palette not our survival instincts. If your generally in agreement with me then the Capital Grille is right up your prospective alley and will definitely set the bar higher.   While the steaks are absolutely excellent, they take a great amount of pride and care in the preparation of everything. Starting with the appetizers, the oyster and shellfish platters were well done and exceptionally fresh especially when you consider we are in the middle of the desert. The Kona Sirlon was cooked to absolute perfection and the rub composed of coffee and other seasonings gave you all the more reason to linger over every bite. The dinner service was absolutely perfect, he remained observant and ensured we were taken care of without being obtrusive seemingly allowing us to dine from the horn of plenty."}
{"text":"Great place. Love the lobster bisque. Onion Straws The dry aged steaks and ribeye are always good. I've always had a great meal at the capital Grille."}
{"text":"\"My husband Ted and I celebrated his b-day with dinner here March 22nd. I must say this wonderful restaurant \"pulled out all the stops\" to make our evening so memorable.  When we arrived and shown to our table, we were surprised to find colorful b-day confetti spread over the tablecloth.  Also propped against the candle was a card thanking us for picking this restaurant to celebrate his big day.  We'd requested Jill, our favorite server, because she's so friendly, attentive and knowledgeable about all things, not only on the food menu, but the extensive wine list as well.  After a delicious dinner of shrimp cocktails, Australian lobster tails and wonderful marinated mushrooms, we were further surprised with a beautifully decorated dessert with \"Happy B-day\" written in chocolate.  On this dish was a small cheesecake and a chocolate/coffee dessert to share - free of charge.  Jill took our photo, developed and framed it, then presented it to us as a wonderful remembrance of a fantastic dinner and evening.  How could you make a celebratory dinner any better?  Thank you so much to Jill and the Capital Grille for such a fantastic experience!\"  To quote the famous expression \"We'll be back!\""}
{"text":"I wouldn't suggest trying Capital Grille during major events because the food quality decreases. I am a major fan of their lobster Mac and cheese and was craving it during Valentine's Day. I ordered take out and when I got home I barely had any lobster(3 claws) and the amount of pasta was minimal."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Capital Grille for our anniversary and we are glad we did.  When we arrived our table had Rose Petals and a card on the table.  The food and service was excellent.  My husband had the Porterhouse Steak and I had the Sirloin and it was cooked to perfection. Chris P. was our server and he was very attentive.  I would highly recommend The Capital Grille and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Went there recently with my team from work.   I went with the signature steak - the porchini crusted porterhouse.  It was good but not great.  Very fatty.  Sides were ok but not great.   I'm not rushing back."}
{"text":"I had lunch here. Chef's choice deserve a try;) The fillet mignon with onion and mushroom is tasty!"}
{"text":"Sublime!!!    The service was beyond belief, our waiter Ken was charming,  attentive and very knowledgeable .  The food was perfection...loved every dish we had, from the crab cakes and lamb chops to the flourless chocolate cake and cheesecake. It was an adventure in dining and a memorable evening.  All at our table will be back!"}
{"text":"Exceptional overall! Food is fantastic, highly recommend requesting Joe McFadden as your server. He is effortlessly friendly, culinary knowledgeable, and wonderful at selecting the perfect wine.  This is The Spot to go to when visiting the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Wonderful servicd Great atmosphere Will definitely return all the way from Columbia,  SC"}
{"text":"Having recently moved to the Burgh, my wife and I decided to make our first visit during Restaurant Week and we were not disappointed.  We went on a weeknight and set reservations as recommended by the front desk when I called. The service was attentive with the staff not hovering despite the crowd. When our server  T arrived, we mentioned that we were celebrating and wanted to have a leisurely meal and she absolutely delivered. We asked to see the Restaurant week menu along with the standard menu (with the HUGE wine menu). Our questions were met with careful consideration and suggestions for options were all great.  We both had the  RW specials with Caesar Salads,  Filets topped with Grilled Shrimp, shared sides of green beans, mashed potatoes and the FABULOUS Lobster Mac n Cheese. Salad was excellent but could have had a few more croutons. The steaks were exactly as ordered and were delivered in a very tasty au jus. The shrimp were much more than we expected both in quantity, size and flavor. My wife is not much of a potato eater but had a second helping of the mashed, especially the skins. The best surprise was the Lobster Mac n Cheese with lots of lobster, thick, rich, creamy sauce that invited us to eat more and more. Very decadent. Great comfort food.  Highly recommend it. Dessert was also included in the fixed meal and server T suggested the choices might narrow as the evening went on so we were kept up on what was available as the meal progressed. We both opted for the cheesecake, but due to allergies omitted the berries/sauce. It arrived with a creme brulee topping with a light fluffy center and a firm homemade crust . The portion was just enough to top off a delightful meal ( we took leftovers of everything and are enjoying it again tonight)  Decor was very men's club and a little over the top, but warm. All in all the dinner and entire experience was memorable. Our server stuck around to chat when possible and was very personable, and is definitely an asset to the Grille.  We will definitely return and hope to try other dishes , but would be glad to request the same server as she was that good.  Thanks for making our anniversary even more special..."}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say. From the onion bread to the spicy calamari cooked to perfection my appetizers were delicious. Also ordered the scallops as well as the lobster mac n cheese which is heavenly to say the least. Wish I could come back everyday!!"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of the Capital Grille being from Boston.  This addition did not fail.  Great food, great service and well done drinks.  Thanks as well for the wonderful Truffle fries.  They were wonderful!!"}
{"text":"Our business group had take out for lunch.  I had the Lobster & Crab Burger, along with an order of clam chowder.    Chowder - not the best, or worst.  A little above average.  Good texture, and taste was good, not too salty or bland Lobster & Crab Burger - this is the reason, I'm giving 5 stars.  Very good burger.  Unlike most crab burgers, this one had little filling such as bread.  It was filled with mostly crab and lobster meat.  The sauce that comes on the side was a tangy tarted based sauce.    I will try again when I can afford another $30 lunch."}
{"text":"I recently went here for the first time with family members.  On the appearance level, this restaurant has a very suave upscale look. The lighting and decor make for a very pleasing atmosphere. Also, the waitstaff are very pleasant and hospitable.  The downside of this restaurant is that the food is very overpriced considering the portions. I ordered the salmon ($35.00) which was served with a side of green beans. I asked if I also could have a side order of rice. I was given two scoups of sticky white rice and charged $6.00 extra.   The salmon itself was good, but the serving was much TOO SMALL for a $35.00 charge.  When I left the restaurant, I was still hungry. My food bill total for the entree, soft drink and tip was $50.00+.  Bottom line: Not worth the money. If I'm going to spend $50.00 on a meal, the plate should be filled."}
{"text":"The BEST meal that I have ever had! I enjoyed the steak with lobster tails. The steam was made to perfection and the lobster (which was removed from the shells) melted in my mouth! I also enjoyed the lobster bisque which also contained large pieces of lobster.  The wait staff was top notch!  The only negative was that the valet parking staff wasn't too friendly! However, from the time I walked through the front door until I left the restaurant everything was A-1"}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant for my recent birthday.  Wow, great view, especially at night if you attain a window seat.  The appetizer we devoured was Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarella with Vine Ripe Tomatoes...great!  I had the steak & lobster (note very light on lobster in this meal-small portion) with side of fries drizzled with truffle oil...this alone is worth the meal! My husband had the dry aged sirloin with asparagus & dessert creme brulee.  We had enough food to make another meal for the next day! Atmosphere, service and meal were one of the best I have experienced...a glass of nice champagne finished the evening off nicely.  Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Best bar in town! I am very particular about my Martinis.......the bartendes at CG know their s**t. Add that to great food and awesome location......can't beat evening! !"}
{"text":"The filet mignon with lobster mac I would definitely have as a last meal.  My husband and I come here for special occasions and we both would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"The Capital Grille is always a destination whenever I visit my sister here. It is elegant and impressive. We were there recently and both had a cup of French onion soup, filet mignon and grilled asparagus. The soup was piping hot, incredibly delicious and nicely presented. The filet was perfectly cooked medium rare and had terrific flavor. The top half of asparagus were good the bottom parts were somewhat woody. Our server, Shay, was perfectly professional with a delightful personality. She was quite attentive. Other staff were friendly and welcoming, checking frequently to see that everything was as it should be. Would highly recommend the Capital Grille for highly prized food and pleasant ambience."}
{"text":"I had the fish of the day - Halibut (a common special). Waitress recommended it Oscar style AND so do I. It was absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Bottom line, save your money and go to Mastros. I'm not a fan of capital grill but decided to give it a shot since I hadn't been there for ages.  Old country club decor, servers that can barely crack a smile, and the food is a poor value. The good dishes were the lobster crab cake appetizer which had large chunks of lobster and a fresh corn salsa, and the spinach salad.  Both of our steaks were ordered med rare and came out rare. We sent them back and the filet was ok but my kc strip was still rare in the center. The filet was very bland even though it was served with a pathetic portion of cippolini onions, mushrooms, and a sauce. The kc strip with roquefort cheese and crispy onions on top could have been amazing if cooked properly though it can't really hold a candle to Mastros. Dessert was unimpressive as well and really uninspired. Obviously left feeling disappointed and bewildered how this place stays in business with so many amazing restaurants around..."}
{"text":"You are always made to feel special when dining here.  The service is top notch, the food is yum.  Capital Grill never disappoints from the time you are greeted at the door tell you leave you will feel like their most important guest!"}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype.   My bro-in-laws girl always raved about this place...we surprised her and took her here last night for her b-day, $775 tab for 7 people, basically it was $1K with a good tip, and nothing we ate was amazing...and that was the consensus from everyone. Average at best, had much better elsewhere for less money.  Atmosphere was pretty nice, service was sub-par/slow, bar was very slow at getting drinks out, food was fast and presented really nice but unfortunately we all ordered med-rare streaks/lamb and all came to the table med/overcooked...would think their line cooks could get the temps right for the price. Sides were good, birthday girl was happy overall which is all that matters as it was for her, but I would not recommend this place for the price nor will I be going back soon.  My wife read they were bought out by Red Lobster Corp or something, which probably hasn't helped anything."}
{"text":"We had one of the best experiences at a steakhouse ever. Went to vegas for husbands birthday and this dinner made our trip. The food was great, and the ambiance overlooking the strip at night was remarkable!! But the manager, Andrew Weintraub, went above and beyond by comping the entire meal because our waitress admit-tingly forgot to mention the nightly specials which included a bone-in filet. It was no biggie, the filet husband ordered was great. We didn't ask nor expect such a righteous and generous move. What a great experience! And we will definitely visit here again."}
{"text":"Always good food, the delmonico rubbed filet is amazing, a group of nine of us and everything was great!  Great staff!"}
{"text":"Oscar was fantastic. Great service and great food.  I've been to numerous capital grilles. This particular location was more like a Denny's. Disorganized and messy."}
{"text":"Pro: Filet mignon is amazing  Con: Stuffy environment"}
{"text":"Service was average. Had to send steak back as it was crunchy on the outside. Potatoes Au Gratin seemed like something out of a box. Waitress brought another member of our party the incorrect wine. Valet took 45 minutes to get our car. In general, a disappointing experience. Won't be back."}
{"text":"*Caveat: lunch review!  This place is so fancy the Diet Coke comes in little glass bottles.  I think the poor waiter brought me about 5 of them over the lunch.  I sure hope they recycle--if not I'm going back and dropping this to 3 stars.  Great place for a business lunch with a wide selection of salads, sandwiches, and burgers.  You could of course go all out on the steak, but this has always seemed a bit heavy for me over lunch and I'm basically T-Rex when it comes to steak.  I had the lobster and crab burger and it was excellent.  Impeccable service and attention to detail, would definitely do lunch again.  Quiet enough to talk without raising your voice.  Not sure if it would be worth a dinner trip, as there is nothing unique here--typical formula for a steak house that you can find all over the Valley/US of A/World.  If you're in the area though it's a nice place with a menu that will please most diners."}
{"text":"One of the best Steakhouses, always consistent. Great food and service. You can people watch at the bar"}
{"text":"The service is always phenomenal! I had the burger which was cooked perfectly and delicious! My husband had sliced ribeye ordered med rare came out med well plus. He was disappointed, but he has a strict never send anything back policy.  It was my birthday and they decorated the table and brought  me dessert on the house. Very nice touch.  No trip to TCG would be complete without a round of Stoli Doli's!! So good!!  We will be back."}
{"text":"MMM. The Captial Grill, this is a place you know what to expect. Excellent steak and sides, some good appetizers and really good service.   On my last visit, We ordered the Filet au Poivre, cream spinach, au gratin potatoes, crab and lobster cakes, lobster bisque and creme brulee. Everything was prepared perfectly. The steaks were cooked spot on, the sides couldnt have been tastier. The peppercorns on the au poivre were so good, toasted well and just complement the filet nicely.   I definitely recomend this place if your looking for a nice upscale place for dinner with really good steaks."}
{"text":"This is a great place. From the outside the place is inviting  and once inside everything is great. The service is really good.  The food is good and tasty. I wish I was told I ordered too much. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical about going to Capital Grille where I was part of a party celebrating my friend's birthday but I must say I was very pleasently surprised. Everything was immaculate starting from the decor and a view through service and food. Appetizers were outstanding - fried calamaries with jalopeno and red peppers were melting in my mouth and I could not stop eating them. My salmon was very well prepared and a portion was very generous; i tried my friend's steaks and they were  all perfectly prepared and delicious. Service was extremely attentive. Well deserved five stars"}
{"text":"Had never been to Charlotte, NC before or to this restaurant but all I have to say is Wow!  Amazing meal as I had the Filet Minon and it was one of the best meals I have ever eaten.  As and added bonus the waiter pointed out that the DT Suh from the Miami Dolphins was at the next table over and when he got done I went and asked for his autograph and he was very nice and gave it to me.  This place was incredible from the moment we walked in to the moment we left.  It is on the very expensive side but well worth every dime we paid.  I would recommend this place to anyone visiting who wants an upscale atmosphere and a great top notch dinner."}
{"text":"This is one of the best dinners I have had celebrating my birthday and was my first time at the restaurant.  Parking was convenient, the table was ready and decorated with a happy birthday note on the table.  We were offered complementary champagne.  Portions were huge, the steak was tender and I had the best dessert ever, the flour less chocolate espresso cake.  Service was impeccable, the view was great and the next day they called to make sure we enjoyed ourselves.  I will definately return soon."}
{"text":"With so many 5 star reviews this restaurant seemed to be an easy choice. Must of had a bad night tonight.  Waiter screwed up my order and the place was so loud and busy servers couldn't even squeeze past people."}
{"text":"Very nice steaks.  Very nice strip views.    The calamari is the best I've ever had.  The wine list is long and there are lots of good inexpensive options.    The filet at lunch is probably the best steak deal in Las vegas."}
{"text":"We were a little early,so we sat in the lounge while waiting for our table. The bar menu looks great...need to go back and nosh in there sometime! Anyway, our meal was wonderful. Our server was a little stiff, not very warm, but...oh well.Sometimes I wonder if they get annoyed because we don't drink alcohol...we spend $ on the food. We had the caprese salad(excellent), I had the tenderloin with poached lobster and my husband had the sirloin. Both steaks had amazing flavor and sear to them. The lobster was succulent! We shared a side of the mashed pots...best restaurant mashed I've ever had. Finished with a creme brulee and blood orange sorbet with biscotti...both very tasty and perfectly portioned. I've been in the restaurant industry for years...including fine dining. Had our server been just a little bit more personable, I would have rated it a 5. We still tipped 25%...but a smile now and then would have been nice."}
{"text":"This is my favorite steakhouse! Their appetizers, salad are well made and delicious. The steaks are cooked to exactly to the diner's request. Great place to begin night on the town in uptown Charlotte or celebrate an important event."}
{"text":"Once again, Capital Grille is leaps and bounds better than any other fine dining restaurant in Charlotte, NC.    I absolutely love this restaurant!  Service is spot on, and the food prepared perfectly.    Scott was our waiter and he is outstanding.  Great sense of humor, all the while very knowledgable of the menu.    My friends and I came to Charlotte to celebrate our friend's 50th birthday.  We started our evening at a lovely table outside with cocktails.  The pineapple infused martini is heavenly.  The Arnold Palmer cocktail was nice, but I probably will not chose that cocktail on my next visit.  The birthday girl had a tasty Bohemian.     The three of us shared a mouth watering ribeye and a side order of lobster macaroni.  I hear this particular side dish is very popular.  We each had a chopped salad.  The salad was a mixture of amazing flavor, but portion of salad a bit large.  None of us finished our salads.  We polished off our pleasant dining experience with a glass of cognac.  Heavenly!  Then our waiter Scott surprised the table with a delicious cheesecake and a slice of chocolate heaven on a dessert plate!  Scott was great and our celebration was perfect for our friend.    The road noise was a bit bothersome, but Charlotte is a happening city and I would dine outside again in a skinny minute."}
{"text":"I was able to treat my family to dinner during my mom's visit from Puerto Rico. Many of my family haven't yet experienced TCG Phoenix yet, however I have many times. Each time I return I am blown away by the knowledge of the servers and the high level of customer service.   Terry W. was our server this time and not only was I greeted with a warm welcome and a hug (He's been my server before), he also introduced himself and shook hands with everyone in my party. He was friendly, made conversation, and I'm pretty sure became friends with my mother - they were exchanging travel stories and even continued the evening speaking to each other in French! I can't say enough about great things about Terry. I will be requesting him for myself, and my guests in the future. Even my 9  month old nephew lit up every time Terry came around! He is a gem and a wonderful asset to The Capital Grille. **Tip: Your server will always have the best recommendation for you if you aren't sure what you want, but can tell them what you like.**  Torri M. is such a wonderful person. She's sweet, friendly, and always on top of things. I have worked with her for years, and I can't thank her enough for her generosity and kindness. I always look forward to seeing and speaking with her!  Great food & service is great food & service - chain or not. The Capital Grille Phoenix definitely sets the bar to new heights for excellence in service. Any restaurant that wants to consider themselves to be a competitor in Food & Beverage should look to TGC Phoenix as a role model. They will always have my business."}
{"text":"I was really hoping to love this place but I just left feeling disappointed. I will start with the pros- the service was AMAZING. We could not have asked for better service. The salads were good, the lobster macaroni was to die for, bread was fresh, and the wine was great. Ok, now the negatives. Three out of the four of us ordered the filet and it was literally served at room temperature and did not blow any of us away. I was not a huge fan of the decor and the lobster \"add on\" was average tasting. My husband and I typically go to Ruth Chris on special occasions for steak and Capital Grille filet didn't even compare. The whole time I was wishing we had went to Ruth Chris instead. If I were rating them on the lobster macaroni and creme brulee I would give them 5 stars, but this is a steak house. For the high price tag the steaks should be exceptional and it just didn't do anything for me. Bummer."}
{"text":"I have been to this location 2 times.  Both times the food was excellent.  The lobster mac and cheese is a great side and would highly recommend if you must choose just 1.  But all the sides are excellent.  As for the steak itself....they are great.  The bone-in Kona crusted is my personal favorite, however, you really cant go wrong with any of the suggestions.  The service is exactly what you would expect from this type of a restaurant.  I only give this 4 stars, as I had to wait for about 20 minutes for a table, even though I made a reservation 2 weeks in advance.  Also, the table they eventually sat us at had no one sitting at it for the 20 minutes that we waited.  If it was not for this, it would be 5 stars.  Also, a bit pricey, but it is relative to any other steak house.  Creme brulee was also very good."}
{"text":"I recently celebrated my 24th bday in Vegas. I ordered the kona crusted filet and it was amazing. I also had their signature martini, the stoli doli. To my knowledge it's pineapple soaked in stoli vodka for weeks. Our waiter was as knowledgable as could be of everything from the drinks to the vegetables. I will make this must stop everytime I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Wow! Such a great place, they really went above and beyond. We went for our  anniversary and our first time. To start the service was unbeatable. The menu was great, my husband ordered the surf and turf special and they brought him crab legs rather than the lobster tail that he ordered. The waiter immediately noticed the mistake and brought us out a lobster tail after letting us enjoy the crab legs while we waited. We received complimentary dessert and champagne for our anniversary as well as a picture and card to remember the occasion. We were beyond impressed with the entire experience! We will be going back again and again."}
{"text":"This was my first time hear, had no idea what to order, so I asked the waitress.  I went with all her recommendations and it couldn't have been better.  Started off with the \"wedge\" salad, which I have never been a fan of wedge salads, but I ate every last bit.  The bacon and blue cheese dressing were enough to make me want to like my plate clean.  Then had the Porcini Rubbed Delmonico with 12-year aged Balsamic and the mac and cheese.  If you go you HAVE to have the Mac and Cheese with Lobster, it is to die for!  My boyfriend kept raving about it, and to be honest I didn't really believe him.  Not until I took that first bite, I was done for!  All the flavors just melt in your mount and bland into this amazing deliciousness, really it's that good."}
{"text":"First time here and excellent food and service. We requested a window table and great view. Tuna was excellent and steaks. We had crime brûlée and coconut pie for dessert, both amazing"}
{"text":"Five Stars for service !!!!!!  Four stars for food !! 4.5 overall score   Great restaurant with awesome service and good food. Give the food 4 stars. Good high quality food. Absolutely better than average. Definitely going to get your money's worth.   FOOD: Ordered 2lb lobster with jumbo shrimp cocktail. Shrimp were fresh and served with a cocktail sauce that was familiar but with a little kick. Would recommend.  The lobster was cool to perfection. Recommend letting the lobster cool a bit before eating. They brought mine piping hot and the taste was off. Hard to explain but trust me as soon as it cooled off, the lovely taste of lobster was obtained. $25/lb I find it was a great value.  Definitely recommended to lobster lovers. 2lbs is more than enough. Would suggest sharing. I've had better, but happy to come back for Seconds.   SERVICE:  is where this place stands out above the rest.  Everyone from the receptionist to the manager greeted us with appreciation and pleasant attitudes. They were very attentive to my comfort and happiness. Never had to ask for a refill on my water or ice tea. (My biggest pet peeve). My server Melissa (red head) was pretty much awesome in every way. She asked me How everything was and told her that I had 4 claws with my lobster. She informed me that I should of only had 2 claws and told me she would talk to the manager about it. The manager came by and talked to me. He assured me that this was highly unusual and he would investigate it further. Thinking he would just give me an excuse, I was surprised when he apologized and would replace my lobster with a new one. I just wanted to trade in 2 claws for more tail but he gave me everything to make sure I was happy. Kuddos guys because actions like this makes me happy to spend 30 minutes of my life to tell all the restaurant goers to eat here. If you're not happy, they will try to make you leave that you are important enough to have you coming back for more. Great job guys !!!!  Best service ever !!"}
{"text":"Twin lobster tails: extremely overcooked and tasteless. Was going to get whole main lobster and waiter suggested these were much better. I think they just had overstocked trying to get rid of :-(. Very slow service. Told waiter at the start we had to leave by 6:15 yet he dragged his feet getting one piece of cheese cake in the end waiting almost ten minutes for it. I won't eat at this location again. On the plus side they have the best bread basket anywhere.  I must say the restaurant did call and offer to make it right so you can't really ask for any more then that. No ones perfect all the time."}
{"text":"Had my wedding reception last Saturday in one of their private rooms. I could not be happier with the room, the wait staff, and especially the food! Thank you Jackie for helping me put it all together."}
{"text":"Not really sure what the hype is about this place.  Great service though.  I ordered the \"Roast Chicken\" but was dry and overcooked.  Tasted like a $6 Rotisserie chicken from your nearby grocery store. NOT worth paying $28 **************I don't recommend their \"Roast Chicken\".  Their \"Lobster Bisque Soup\" was OK"}
{"text":"Returned to The Capital Grille to celebrate a birthday and of course the meal and the service were peerless. I had my usual, Filet Mignon and my wife had a seafood dish special. I don't know how they do it but the steak was better than the last time, which was great, and my wife couldn't stop complimenting the choice she had made. As to our waiter, Michael Fitzgerald, he was very knowledgeable and attentive. As Michael was describing the specials and discussing our wine selection my appetite only increased.  Of course we will return to The Capital Grille and we hope that Michael is available to assist us in our search for the perfect meal."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness what a treat.  Went here the first time for my birthday and then again tonight for a celebration. Both times we went here the food is flawless. I mean, cooked to perfection. So far, we've tried:  - French Onion Soup - Caesar Salad - Tomato/Mozzarella  - Bone-in Kona NY Strip - Bone-in Filet (special) - Dry Aged Porterhouse. - Mushrooms - Potatoes Gratin  Apart from the potatoes which were a bit too creamy for my liking, everything has been wonderful. I'd definitely go with the mushrooms - they pair perfectly with steaks. Yum.  Tonight was especially great because of our server - Angelo. Not only was he professional (like everyone at the restaurant) but he was incredibly knowledgeable and funny to boot. Who your server is can really make or break the evening and we were lucky to have Angelo help us out. He answered our questions (Should we go with the porterhouse or ribeye? What's the difference between wet and dry aging?) and was a pleasure.   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The Capital Grille is so good. They have a drink called the Stoli Doli where they take fresh pineapple and soak it in vodka for several days and then drain out the vodka and serve it cold. It is the best drink I have ever had. They have a great variety of steaks and an even better seafood menu. Its a good place to go on a date."}
{"text":"Made reservations for this place a week in advance BF asked for a window table and everything was confirmed and ready to go. We went there on a Thur in the evening in attempts to \"beat the crowd\" when we walked in the place was empty (typical for a weekday) we gave the hostess (she was nice) out name and she asked another lady a question (quietly) NOW as l mentioned before the place was EMPTY only one other table. She quickly sat us in the first table closest to the register/hostess station, which was weird because we specifically asked for and confirmed a window table (guess we looked like we might run out on the bill) We took that in stride and just tried to enjoy the meal, food was decent enough, filet mignon was nicely cooked but lobster Mac and cheese was the highlight. The server was nice but he NEVER checked on us, we both had salads to start, entree and a dessert and he NEVER refilled out drink even ONCE never even asked if we needed anything else. Needless to say the service was less than perfect, guess we also look like bad tippers. We have been to and frequented MANY fine dining establishments in Vegas and this is by far the worst l was ever treated. lm never going back, the service was horrible and they seem too presumptuous and judgmental. Don't go here l would try Tender at the Luxor or even Delfrisco's for better food and service"}
{"text":"The food & service are amazing! We have never had a disappointing experience at The Capital Grill. If you're eating light but still want to treat yourself, try the spinach salad with grilled shrimp, the shrimp are HUGE! Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Food and beverages were outstanding. We ate a shrimp appetizer and then steak and crab. We sampled deserts that were delicious. Our server, Darrel was fantastic! A high end steak house like this is not cheap, so everything had better be perfect, and it was."}
{"text":"I booked a reservation for four on Wednesday night and ended up having a fifth join our party. We arrived on time but the fifth person and the window seat request caused a slight delay. Corey the manager was gracious and kept us informed on the status of our table, he even bought us three appetizers because of the delay. As for the meal it was as awesome as ever. The food was cooked properly and was delicious. My guests were very impressed with the level of service and attention. Don't hesitate to dine here but know you get what you pay for and make sure you make reservations in advance, the wait at 7:00 on a Wednesday can be two hours or more."}
{"text":"Everything about the place is first rate.  Food and service are hard to beat.  But the prices are very strong.  I go once or twice a year and afterwards always ask the question, Was it worth it.  I guess my answer is a marginal yes. Once or twice a year."}
{"text":"From take out orders to large lunch parties, the staff at Capital Grille has always made lunch outings truly amazing.   We recently celebrated a colleague's 30th anniversary...the attention to details (from greeting to special glass of Prosecco, vase of pink roses to go, and the special touch to the cake we brought in) was immaculate and the customer service was above and beyond. Thanks for always being the greatest at making our dining experience so spectacularly flawless!"}
{"text":"Amazing. I have paid more money on a steak and it was not nearly as good as the steak I had here.   I am not a huge fan of the decor, a little boring for my taste, but it does read classy expensive establishment. The wait staff is attentive and very friendly.   Absolutely loved the lobster and the calamari. My boyfriend got the porcini aged balsamic steak and I highly recommend it. Couldn't resist stealing a good portion of his steak. They have a nice wine list and delicious espresso that I had in place of desert.   Great place for an anniversary dinner or anytime you are in the mood for a great meal and have the money to spend on it."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of visiting the Capital Grille on Saturday August 20, 2016....the place is awesome and the atmosphere is great.....sat at the bar and had the pleasure of meeting Rachel and see and old friend Nate whom I met years ago at Mitchell's Fish Market and Flemings Steakhouse.  Everything from the moment you walk in sets the mood....you must try it I don't think you will be disappointed.   Check out my pics from my bar menu."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant. The first experience I had at Capital Grille was in Los Angeles at the Beverly Center. From that moment on this was my FAVORITE restaurant. The food and service at any location is superb. I always get the rack of lamb with macaroni and cheese (no lobster) and their creamy bacon corn! This food will have your mouth watering every time you think about it! I went to this particular location on Valentine's Day with my husband. Everyone from the front desk hostess to the bartender and waiter was phenomenal! To have your service just as spectacular as the food is a win win combination. The atmosphere is warm and inviting and very intimate. They have a killer wine list and your waiter will break everyone of them down for you! Capital Grille is a 5 star dining experience for sure! I recommend anyone to try it at least once!"}
{"text":"Heard many good reviews about it. Decided to go there and it was delicious. It is a bit expensive but your defiantly getting your money's worth. I will defiantly be back. The Filet is to die for. Everything I had was absolutely delicious! Do not hesitate to go."}
{"text":"I used to go here a lot with clients or colleagues. I really like the bar - great bartenders, very professional. The food however is nothing to write home about. It is definitely not worth the premium they're charging. The filet I had last time was pretty much done instead of medium and it did not have any taste to it either. Del Frisco's in South Park is much better (but pricey as well)."}
{"text":"Capital Grille does not disappoint. Made a last minute dinner reservation for 9 people and they were able to accommodate. Wait staff was very attentive and the meal was outstanding. I have been to several Capital Grille locations and this was by far my favorite. With 9 people, they did not automatically add a gratuity so be sure to check your bill if you have a large party."}
{"text":"Last night was epic, seafood tower, tuna tartare, Chilean sea bass, steamed spinach, asparagus & NY strip. Fabulous! !! If you sit at the bar Petee will take great care of you."}
{"text":"We love the ambiance at Capital Grille! When making reservations we always request a booth closest to the windows for a view of the strip during the evenings. The wine list is tasteful with half bottle's available. Do to the fact that we expect and require stellar service, we also request a Sr. Server to tend to our table. With this, we have yet to be disappointed with the service.  Our coarse usually consists of the French Onion Soup, which comes in a large portion (enough to share), House Salad, Crab Cakes and the Fillet Mignon. We enjoy our steaks cooked medium and unlike a lot of other steak houses, the temp is just right every time. The Au Gratin Potatoes are sinfully delectable and quite a treat.  A definite recommendation for a quiet couple's night in Vegas!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to cap off a nice business and pleasure trip to Las Vegas by dining at The Capital Grille. In a word - FANTASTIC! First, the restaurant is beautiful with nice views of the Strip. Second, the entire staff, including our server Eric were especially kind and attentive and treated us as very special guests. And third - the food is fabulous in both presentation and taste. Excellent wine and a great steak!  The Capital Grille is truly one of the finest restaurants in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"You know, I have been to Capitol Grille in Las Vegas and in Scottsdale, but dammit, I have yet to make it into the Dining Room!  I love this place, it has the nicest bar area and Ichibod, the bartender in Las Vegas made me one of the best Lemon Drops I've ever had.  He's probably one of the nicest guys you ever want to meet also!    The Stoli Doli is pretty good too.  I must go back and try the food.  BF loves it.  I love the atmosphere.  Very romantic, comfortable and service is great."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. The food is great. I usually get the mango salmon salad which is my favorite. I have tried the French onion soup as well and it is delicious! The staff is very friendly and the service is great. The place itself is very nice inside. I definitely recommend Capital Grille!"}
{"text":"Today my family and I went to capital grill for their first Easter Brunch. We were told over the phone that the menu would be a la carte which wasn't true. When we sat down we had so many different waitresses our orders and drinks came out wrong and we had to order multiple times.  The food was still good but the service was not up to par.  Nice try capital grill but stick to what you know."}
{"text":"Food was awesome and the Stoli Doli  was great!  Service was great...atmosphere was top notche!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband loved our dining experience here. We started off with the calamari which was delicious and served with buttery hot peppers.  Me and the hubby both ordered the NY strip steak and agreed that it was one of the best strip steaks we had ever had. The flavor and texture was perfect. The sides we chose were also very very good. I had the green beans which were very flavorful and my husband tried the truffle fries again super good though a little low on the salt per my taste.   Their desserts were also quite good. The berries with creme anglaise was as good as berries with creme can taste. The hubby had a flourless chocolate cake that was quite decadent. Overall superb service, great decor/ambiance and splendid food."}
{"text":"I love this place. My husband and I eat here every time we come to Vegas. Staff is always polite. Food is always fantastic. Lobster mac and potatoes au gratin are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"We entertained our extended family of 15 for Easter brunch and the food and service were terrific. CG is consistently great with the quality of food and service.  Plus the view of the strip is a nice plus. Thanks for another great meal!!"}
{"text":"The food and service have always met our expectations for this caliber restaurant. That's why we chose to have dinner there tonight to celebrate  anniversary # 33. But tonight was exceptional. In addition to the expected excellent food, Stacy, Managing Partner, and our server Terry provided an unexpectedly high level of service that makes this night memorable. THE place to make a special occasion truly special."}
{"text":"I eat at Capital Grille quite a lot, however, my last experience a couple of days ago was not the best.  I ordered a special order for a fish burger made with sea bass.  When I received the bill, it was $31.00!!!!!.  When I questioned it, Peter said he would go and rerun the bill for a regular fish burger but then came back and said \"they said the reason is you are paying for an entree\". The waiter Peter did not tell me that I was paying the price for an entrée. If I had known, I would have ordered the entire entrée and not PAY $31.00 for a &?**! BURGER AND FRIES!!!  UNACCEPTABLE!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! We had a late lunch; it was elegant, relaxed, unhurried, and delicious.   From the moment we entered the establishment, we were greeted by friendly and courteous hostesses, seated immediately (we had reservations), and our waiter, Ken, was delightful. The pacing was perfect; from the drinks to the bread to the taking of the order to the meal being served. My dining companion had the scallops \"plate\".  The salad was beautiful in color and texture, had just the right amount of dressing, and wasn't too large.  The scallops were as delicious as Ken had described.  The risotto was perfect. I had the salmon and avocado salad, which was done to perfection.  The portion was generous without being overwhelming.  This restaurant just moved to the top of our list; the chef and kitchen staff are outstanding, service is superb yet unobtrusive, and ambiance is spot on. We were celebrating a birthday, and the dessert was artistically presented as well as  delicious without being too much.  The cheesecake with creme brule topping was light and creamy, the chocolate flourless cake satisfied even the most discriminating chocolate lover, the berries were fresh, and the strawberry reduction added just the right touch to the dish"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for our year anniversary. They were prepared of course with champagne, a wax sealed note, and rose petals on the table. They even went the extra mile and made sure that we had a window seat with a view of the Strip. The ambiance was very nice, as expected, as this was our first visit to the Capital Grille location in Vegas.   Service: Jeff was awesome. He was personable and provided everything that we needed and wanted. In addition he was very attentive, as were the other servers who brought out our food.   We ordered:  1. Appetizer: Shrimp cocktail - the shrimp were huge and had a good flavor. This was my second time having these and they did not disappoint.   2. Soup: Lobster Bisque - Good as expected. Had more claw meat than expected but still good. they even brought out extra sherry to tweak it to our liking.   3. Filet Oscar- My husband had this entree. The crab was really good. He said it was really good.   4. A La Carte Side - Creamed Corn- Very good. It was double roasted so there was good flavor and a bit of a crunch. Needed a bit of salt. But as expected. Reminded me of my mom's creamed corn which it is a good thing.  5. Seared Tenderloin with Butter Poached Lobster Tail - This was my entree and it was delicious. The steak was tender and cooked to perfection. The lobster was also tender and was a generous portion.   All and all the experience was amazing and worth the money. They pamper you and show keen attention to detail. I look forward to coming here in the future. Jeff even brought out samples of a drink that was really refreshing. I don't remember the name but the drink had fresh pineapple derivative."}
{"text":"Always a great job and the waitstaff are topnotch.  If there's anything amiss, they fix it right away.  The lady who brings your water and bread, Cherry, is as sweet as they come and starts your experience off on the right foot every time.  Between all the Capital Grilles in DC and NY, I eat at one at least once per week and they are consistently good."}
{"text":"Not the best steak house from what I have seen, even between Capital Grills. The one in DC has better steaks."}
{"text":"All around great experience. Went there for our anniversary and when we arrived, the table was covered in little hearts and every employee we encountered said happy anniversary. The waiter was great. He took time to go over wine/drink !emus, as well as the food menu. I ordered the filet Oscar with parmesan truffle oil fries... Both of which were so delicious. Capital is !y new favorite steak house in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Dined with a large group on a Saturday evening. We had a variety of steaks all were cooked perfectly and delicious, best in Vegas. The calamari app was the best we've ever had, perfect. My only complaint was the dessert. Two in our group got the ice cream trio, not only was it partially melted very small scoops but there were no \"fresh baked cookies\"  served with it like the menu stated. Disappointing dessert for an otherwise delicious meal."}
{"text":"I arranged a company dinner here and got some groans for choosing a \"chain restaurant\". Whatever. This CG follows suite of many others with outstanding service and even better food. The simple but delicious Stoli Dolis were great and we thoroughly enjoyed our visit. After our meal everyone relented that a solid choice was made. You can't go wrong with any CG location. My only wish is that there were more room in their bar area; it's a little tight."}
{"text":"I have been to the Capital Grille numerous times before.  This past time was OK, and with so many choices in Scottsdale to eat at, this may be my last time as a result.    My wife and I decided to go up there as a result of AZ Restaurant Week, as Cap Grille was participating, so it was a great excuse to get out of the house on a week night.  They had, like most places a preset menu that had a few choices at a more than usually reasonable price.    The food was very good.  No complaints there, but the service was very average or below average.  The time between the end of my steak and dessert was 45 minutes... truly.  Our server was hardly around after the beginning of the meal, and the table across from us was having the same issues.  It was a busy night, so I get that.  However, they are always adequately staffed to handle the dinner crowd, so this was pretty surprising.    My impression was, that because my wife and I were there for the Restaurant Week special, we got a toned down version of their normally impeccable service..."}
{"text":"I'm torn. I could care less about price if it's worth it. Ex: food is spectacular, service is spectacular. I went for a very early NYE dinner (think before the 6pm hour, so def not crowded). There was good and bad. Good: the dirty vodka martini was spot on. The Brussels sprouts were phenomenal!! The cheesecake made me cry tears of joy while I ate it, and I hate cheesecake. Oh dear lord, it was good.  The BAD: umm, my steak. The first one, a waiter-not ours-set down was not what I ordered. A second \"correct\" one was quickly brought to me...but after 4 or 5 bites, I realized-either this is the worlds most flavorless ribeye, or again, I was served the wrong steak. However, I had eaten into it and didn't want to send back-even my husband agreed it probably wasn't the ribeye I'd ordered. And the service-also not good. The waiter at the table next to us chatted them up, asked about their plans, hell-even told them the specials. Something our waiter never did. I'd loved to have known so I could have ordered some. Ours disappeared after the steaks hit. No checking to see if things were ok, no follow up. My martini ran dry. My husbands beer ran dry. We saw our waiter briefly when he asked if we wanted dessert. I did indeed!! But had I known it would show up about 30 min later, well, I might have passed. Cheesecake, y'all. Nothing exotic, Halfway through desert, our waiter reappeared to simply drop the check and leave. I paid while eating, then decided I was full and would love to have a box for the dessert I paid for. So we sat. And waited. And waited. And WAAAAAIIIITEDDDDD.  Mind you, it's maybe 6:30 pm at this point.   So I won't go back. For the price point-I need great, not ok. All I needed in life was a kick ass steak and vodka martini. I got half. There's better places to blow your money, y'all."}
{"text":"Condor's Piece of Daily Advice:  If a hot, Low Rider bikini model tosses a vodka martini in your face and walks out leaving the tab, there is no better place to be than the Capital Grille at the Biltmore Fashion Park. The bartender was quick with a linen napkin to wipe my face and refreshed the Campari and Coke I had begun. My depression was short and my solace began with the Bar Menu Lamb, a dozen fresh oysters with a hint of vinegar, and a native of San Diego who works as a corporate jet stewardess named Linda. I'll be back to the Capital Grille as soon as I return from San Diego!"}
{"text":"Completely enjoyed this place. We had a party of 15 and the service and food was fantastic. I had the Oscar Filet and it was delicious. The sides are truly special...I loved all the potato sides. The advice they gave us on wine was great as well. Fully satisfied with our meal here."}
{"text":"Great service and wines. Best calamari in town"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Restaurant was a wee bit loud for my taste."}
{"text":"A bit pricey, but always tasty and great service. Second time in a row their wine list has been wrong compared to what was served and they didn't offer anything to make this right."}
{"text":"This is probably the best steak house in Las Vegas. They have an impressive wine list. The food is exceptional. The steaks are excellent. You have to try the lobster bisque."}
{"text":"Pro: The food was delicious and the restaurant is beautiful. Very upscale..You can smell the luxury and money coming in/out the restaurant. No wait time, no reservations needed as we just popped in for lunch. We were seated rite away!    Cons: food came out luke warm. The server was not attentive, and I'm not sure why as the place was not busy at the time. Lest just say his tip went to the other server who had to pick up ours slack. If you don't earn it you don't get it."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night and oh my word! The Porcini Rubbed Delmonico with 15-Year Aged Balsamic was out of this world. The portion was huge & everyone at the table was blown away. I also had the fries with truffle oil and the lobster mac- yum & yum! Husband tried lobster bisque and it was phenomenal. I also had the house Cabernet and it was exquisite. I highly recommend for a beautiful evening."}
{"text":"We were greeted with \" Happy Annversiary\" and two glasses of Champagne.  I though the champagne was actually quite delicious.  We had lobster-crab cakes for appetizers.  There was quite a bit of lobster in the cakes and they were scrumptious.  We shared a 10 oz Filet  which was plenty for us.  It was cooked to perfection.  We had scalloped potatoes and asparagus which we took home left overs.  They had one of our favorite wines from Chandon Domaine which I have not seen in a resturant before. They brought us out 2 small desserts: one on each end of plate with Happy Anniversary in the middle.  They took our picture with their camera and provided us with the picture.  Our waiter was superb along with the service.  The managers made sure we were happy by checking on us several times."}
{"text":"An incredible dining experience. Classy ambiance - dark wood decor and soft lighting. From looking around the dining room, it's apparent this Pittsburgh location draws many business professionals after work.  Service was top notch.... some of the best I've ever received. Our waiter, Greg, was personable, knowledgeable, and very accommodating. I inquired about 2 of the reds on the wine list and he described them and then brought me samples to help me decide. My husband tried the Stoli Doli signature drink and enjoyed that too.  Greg was also very well versed in the menu items and offered suggestions (fyi - they were aged steaks, Kona steak, Porcini steak, lobster mac & cheese, truffle fries, Stoli Doli drink).  I mentioned that I wasn't too hungry and thought I'd get something small and different from my husband's choice so we could share. He offered to split our meals on each plate, so we ended up with a Surf and Turf meal. In addition lobster mac 'n cheese side dish is to die for and includes giant pieces of lobster...   One last tip - free Valet parking at the door!! Make this your first stop in the city and return for your car later. Tip the valet generously and you still make out well.  A wonderful meal from start to finish! No doubt we'll be returning to try more of the menu items, next time from their new location (currently under construction) across from the King of Prussia Mall."}
{"text":"The Capital Grille is really good and consistent.  I've been to two locations, one in Boston and the other in Vegas.  Both had impressive food and great service.  Our waiter in Vegas provided good suggestions on which entree to pick and paired it with a nice Pinot Noir.  I had the filet oscar and finished off my meal with their signature coconut cream pie dessert.  Yum.  I would rate it five stars, but I am hesitant to rank any corporate franchise that high.  Its close though."}
{"text":"Everything is fine at the Capital Grille. The lobster mac and cheese is very good and Rebecca took great care of us, but there's nothing remarkable about this place.   I can't say there was anything bad about the food, it's just over priced. I had the salmon. I can't say that it was any better than the much more reasonably priced Salmon at Atria's. Actually they both pale in comparison to the salmon I get at the café at Giant Eagle Market District.   For the price, I just expected to be wowed."}
{"text":"Our party of six enjoyed the entire fine dining experience; bone-in steaks, lamb chops, Chilean sea bass were all cooked to perfection.  Our table overlooking the strip provided a nice view of the Las Vegas night life.  The dining experience was topped off with the excellent service and staff.  Enough cannot be said about our waiter, Frankie Storione.  Not only was Frankie very knowledgeable about the menu, he was a one-man show.  Very entertaining, humorous and witty, but professional the whole night through  When, not if, we return, we will ask for Frankie!"}
{"text":"Exelant!! Very good food! Fresh, ditaild, flaxible, good service. Divine desert, exelant chiz cake and chocolate cake!"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've visited one of my old favorites. I can tell you that they have not missed a beat. Excellent food, well prepared and presented beautifully. The staff is friendly from the moment you walk in the door. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and made some great suggestions for my party of four. It was my brothers first time to this establishment and he had the prawns and filet which he said was delicious. We are planning to have dinner there again next week.  Thank you Capitol Grille for always making my experience a wonderful time. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Hey, It's The Capital Grill - so you know the food and atmosphere are going to be very high quality - and this one is no different.  Excellent food, beautiful inside, nice and quiet (but not too quiet).  I always seem to be coming here for lunch and not dinner - and it is the perfect place for a business lunch: good food, swift service, and you are able to have a conversation without shouting.   Very 'classic' interior - yeah, like a DC restaurant inside the beltway where people discuss politics, business and clandestine wars.  There is only one downside - the parking... which is consistently awful ... they almost force you to get valet parking since the rope off most of the nearby parking for valet only - so your choices are to walk far (and be late) or pay for valet.  They are right next door to a similarly high quality Maggiano's, so I am not sure they can do much about it. But the parking problem is enough that it warrants special mention."}
{"text":"Very happy I gave this a try.  Everything was cooked perfectly.   I had the tenderloins with lobster tails,  lobster mac and cheese,  sweet corn with jalapeños and the spinach salad to start.   All around great experience"}
{"text":"A somewhat old school, straight up really good steakhouse....probably a 4.5 star-er great attentive and nice service--especially the guy (forgot his name it he's been there for 20 years) who does a DEAD ON impression of Quint from Jaws.  'A little shaking, a little tenderizing, and down you go...'  menu highlights were the spicy calamari, the bone marrow basted filet and the bone in ribeye.    Sides were good, but not incredible.  But maybe that's because the steaks were stellar!  Can't speak for desert, way too full for that."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch. Came here on a Friday and we had multiple people serving us and they were all on point. The meat was good but I would not put it on the same level as Steak 44 or Dominic's. it is a solid option in a great location. it is my fav spot for a \"power lunch.\""}
{"text":"Wife and I got the chicken. Food took a long time and the chicken was overcooked and dry. The potatoes were tasteless.We got two  club sodas that came to 7.50. In my opinion it was a waste of money. We don't mind paying for a good meal but this was entirely overpriced and the food was not what I would expect from  a high-class restaurant and furthermore it took 20 minutes to get the check. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Really exceptional restaurant. Great service and michelin star quality food.  Good steaks are expected from a quality steak house, so it's hard to break the standard and really impress me. Their dry-aged steaks are phenomenal. Just for yukks, I used my fork to cut the last half of my steak, and it cut like butter!  Gotta reiterate how great the service was. Really top notch professionals - not once did I have to look around for a server when I wanted something. THey anticipated without \"hovering.\" I hate hoverers more than I hate servers who ignore you. There is a fine balance, and Capital Grille hits it squarely.  Again on the service - they were very busy, but it didn't seem like it because they were so unflappable."}
{"text":"Our go to place for a big night out and steak. It has it all...great service, atmosphere and food quality. Wine and spirit selection is also very food."}
{"text":"We ate here before the Coldplay concert. We had a party of 8 and the service was perfect! The restaurant was packed and we were served in a very timely manner.   The food was fabulous. The wine list was even more impressive! I can't wait to go back. I didn't get to enjoy dessert. Next time!!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I decided to dine at the Capital Grill for a special anniversary.  This was our first time at the restaurant, and we left with a lack luster impression.  The service was subpar at best.  After being seated, we waited for a good 5-10 minutes before being greeted.  Our table was partially set, and we needed to ask for napkins halfway through our first course. Our waitress was far from attentive, and it was obvious she did not want to be working.  After mildly checking from across the way on how our dinner was, she quickly rushed to take our dessert order and our bill was on the table before dessert even came out. While we can usually overlook bad service for good food, there wasn't much to be desired when it came to taste and presentation.  We both ordered a Caesar salad, which I've seen plated more appealingly at you local pub.  At $10 a salad, I guess we just expected to see more than a plate half scattered with lettuce and 2 croutons. My fiancé had a steak, which he did say was delicious, and we split a nice batch of their truffle fries.  I got their vegetarian pasta, it was ok - lacked flavor, but I recognized it was a steak house and pasta isn't a speciality. Maybe it was an off night for the kitchen and staff - regardless - we won't be rushing back or recommending it to anyone."}
{"text":"Came here for an Anniversary & it was love at first bite. Made reservations highlighting that it was my anniversary, was looking for a nice view etc. We got that and more. Ordered the delmonico rib eye 12 yr old aged Balsamic, Cream Corn w/Bacon & Lobster Mac & Cheese...the food came out and I damn near fainted. UNBELIEVABLY good, the knife fell into the steak effortlessly. Very juicy, tender. Worth the price. For desert they surprised us with a free cheesecake, glaze & berries on the side. THEE BEST cheesecake, not too rich, tasty & just right. The staff & our waiter Jason was amazing. Beautiful view, lovely decor.  I've never given anything 5 but this place deserves it."}
{"text":"Awesomeness  I had the best corn soup ever so good  Food was worth the cost  I would go back"}
{"text":"i really loved my dining expereince at the LV location,came to eat here to celebrate my stephs bday. we decided on lunch time since we didnt want to be too full to get our drink on for the night time festivites.they took us to our tablewith a great view of the strip looking towards the wynn.they brought us some very fresh bread a room temp butter.we ordered the cesar salad, 14 oz steak, lobster mac and cheese,asparugus spears with hollandaise sauce.the steak was so juicty and tender, a great portion.also the lobster chunks in the mac, was sufficient, we ordered cheesecake and flourless chocalte cake. the service was great, everyone was very nice and attentive.i will most defiently go there again, i cant wait to try the costa mesa location."}
{"text":"Well, as I write this I am waiting slightly on the edge of patiently and completely pissed for my glass of wine that I ordered. My 2 friends have received their cocktails 15 minutes before. We aren't fancy people but we were in need of a delicious meal and we chose this restaurant. We had eaten at the one in Denver and had the best experience. Amazing service and the food was wonderful. Right now I feel like we are being overlooked since we aren't wearing blue hued plaid in the general business casual attire. We are regular people who just landed in Las Vegas looking for a good meal. I will update my review if and when I receive my food.   Update: Ad I put my phone down, my wine arrived and shortly there after our food. We ordered another round of drinks and enjoyed our delicious food. Our server was very nice and we were in for a nice surprise when he dropped off our check. They comped the 2nd round of drinks. It was a very nice gesture and we appreciate it. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Overall had a great meal. I ordered the 10oz fillet, while she ordered the porterhouse. Both were cooked perfectly, as were the brussel sprout and au gratin sides.  We were celebrating a bit of an anniversary, so our server brought out a complimentary dessert, which was also excellent.  My only suggestion for improvement would be for the staff to undergo some training regarding handling and pouring wine, and handling the dishware. Our guy handled our wine glasses like a beer pint, when he should have reached and poured where they were. Also needed to properly protect the table when pouring (a little spillage).  I also noticed another table where a different server brought new bread plates and carried them with his thumb right in the middle of the eating surface.  I know a few people who would have complained and sent them back, but we're not that demanding.  Again.....excellent meal....prepared perfectly.......with friendly service.  But I would expect so for expensive fine dining. If management reads this review, hopefully they  use as opportunity for the staff to ensure their customer's experience is as flawless as the meal."}
{"text":"As of this writing their details on Yelp say they don't do takeout. However, I didn't read that and they said they do takeout when I called. I suggest you skip it if you're looking for takeout.  I got a filet which was cooked correctly but was not a $50 steak. I've had better for half the price. When I picked it up the kid who brought it out had not thought to include utensils. Luckily the friendly bartender asked him, but when I got back to my hotel I found this kid's idea of takeout utensils was three forks. So I got to tear apart my steak like some sort of well off caveman.   The night prior, the Italian place one floor down packaged my food well, included bread and butter and separated cold desert from warm dinner into two bags. Looking for takeout in the area? Try Maggiano's before this place."}
{"text":"Dined last night at Capital Grille. This is another \"go to\" place for business dinners.  Notes:   Sat in the bar for a glass of wine before dinner. I asked bartender to open something fresh. He was more than happy to comply. The bottle was still at room temperature, which in Phoenix generally means too warm. Places of this caliber should serve red wines at the right temp!  Capital Grille, like a lot of high-end steak houses in the Phoenix area, seem to have run off their highly experienced \"professional\" wait staff over the past couple of years. I'm sure this saves the business a few dollars in overhead, but I miss the ambiance created by highly trained waiters. Nevertheless, our server was anxious to please. (The \"busboy\" was clueless.)  I order the steak au poivre. It was excellent. Better than I recall from the last visit.  Drank a 2006 Col Solare with dinner. Special price at $100 per bottle. This was a great deal for this wine."}
{"text":"4.25 stars  Sooooooooooo delicious!   Tried:  - calamari with hot cherry peppers (If you're a calamari fan, this is for you. Crunchy with a little heat and generous proportions)  - french onion soup -- YES YES YES! If I went back, I would order the crock and not just the measly cup. If your doctor has put you on a low sodium diet, step away (and pass your crock to moi.)  - butter poached lobster (kill me now) and beef tenderloins  [My meal. Lobster was divine. Not one big lobster tail but a few small ones [like 1/3 the size of the palm of my hand]. Meat was good but not amazing.]  - Porcini Rubbed Delmonico with 12-Year Aged Balsamic [aka rib eye, but double check that. Deeeeelicious. And insanely large at 22 oz. Great flavor at medium rare. (it should be a crime to cook up steak above medium rare. A crime!)]  - Kona rubbed Delmonico. [the kona rub was all my stepmom could talk about before we got there. Has a coffee-meets-chocolate sort of flavor. And, while it's a \"rub\" like the porcini, the kona comes off as more of a sauce. Seriously tasty but I'm not sure I could personally down 22 oz. of it. Would get this and the porcini or a seafood dish and share.]  - Asparagus (good - not mushy)  - side of mushrooms (also delicious)  - Au gratin (massive. Didn't try it myself but told it was creamy goodness)  Remember: all the meats are a la carte, so be prepared to get some sides.   Dessert was acceptable but not mind blowing (and thus I shed a single baby tear). We got the cheesecake (fluffy while still being fairly dense) and the berries with cream (tasty). Both were good -- indeed, some loved the cheesecake -- but I would have appreciated some different options (e.g., a chocolate cake that wasn't super dark and dense).   Oh! And the service there is abso-friggin-lutley fantastic. Our dinner party consisted of two men and two women. When the waitress came to take our order she asked us the most genius question: \"Ladies, would you like to order first or last?\"  Is that not awesome! So often I'm expected to go first but, surprise surprise, don't know what I want yet. That simple question let us choose in a seamless way. Fantastic! I only wish I remembered her name! All I know is she loved Garth Brooks! :)   Absolutely would return!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my steak and gourmet fries, on another occasion I had a cheeseburger that rocked me. The service is great and the atmosphere is incredible. Went with a group of people and we reserved a private room."}
{"text":"This has always been our favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. My husband and I dined here last night for Valentine's Day. In the past, we always received superb service. However, our first server last night was horrible. There was heart confetti on the table and I received a red rose (my husband requested this), but the server took her time coming to our table. She had another large group and was clearly rushed. She did not place the napkin in our laps. When I asked her about this, she balked and informed me that she was not trained to do that. Not only do servers place the napkin in your lap, they match the napkin to your slacks, skirt or dress. When I told her this, she snapped, \"Do you want another server?\" We said yes. This was a special dinner for us and the restaurant is expensive, but worth the price for exceptional food and service. Thankfully, Koy stepped in as our server, and he was incredible. Our first server should be fired. She alone will ruin the reputation of this wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"Made a special request for the ribeye since it's not on the lunch menu. Asked for medium rare and brussels sprouts. The steak has really great flavor but it came out as medium well. The brussels sprouts are to die for though! Told my server and the manager came, made sure the steak was nice and bloody, replaced my brussels sprouts too, and said lunch is on them. Great food, great service and accountability as well."}
{"text":"If you're sitting at the bar to get a quick bit to eat, I promise you that you won't be disappointed.  My bartender (native Boston) was friendly, conversational and provided great recommendations and service.  Try the bar menu especially the lamb lollipops.  Off of the regular menu, the beef carpaccio with arugula and lemon vinaigrette was simple and clean.  Very refreshing.  But last but not least, cheesecake with berries was a dessert made for two.  It was light and airy...simply heaven.  I look forward to having a full dining experience there."}
{"text":"Its a WOW.....from the moment you open the door, its a pleasant experience.  The decor, the lighting, the way the restaurant is set up, sets the expectation of a fine dining experience.  The Servers introduced themselves, acknowledging you by name.  Everything is explained , care and attention is paid to every detail.  Wine and cocktails were excellent, as well as the appetizers. Soup was out of this world with huge lumps of lobster in it!   Main course was served with care  and inquiries as to if they were exactly as we ordered. Our steaks were cooked exactly as requested and could be cut with your fork.  Outstanding cuts of meat.  The sides were huge and the lobster mac and cheese was outstanding.  Desserts were excellent and again huge portions.   We had so much food that we needed to take a fair amount home.  Which is unusual for us.  The servers took the remaining food, boxed them up in cute boxes, wrote exactly what was in each box and sealed them to prevent  spills.   They were packed into large bags!    The servers in subtle ways, did everything needed before we asked, before we needed it and made it a worry free, no stress dining experience.  Yes we will be back!"}
{"text":"I made reservations for NYE probably around 3 weeks in advance. I am a student so going to what is supposed to be one of the city's elite steakhouses was going to be a treat. My girlfriend and I had 9:15 reservations and it took until about 9:30-9:45 to be seated which is understandable and the bar staff was wonderful while we waited. It was all downhill from there. We were both dressed extremely nice even better than some of the older patrons that were there who were wearing polo shirts and tshirts with sports coats.  That did not matter since we were 10 years younger than every other patron.  Our service was terrible which I suspect was due to the fact that we were the youngest people in the restaurant. It took 20-30 min to receive my bud light. I ordered the kona crusted strip medium rare and the only part of the steak that was slightly pink was the part near the bone. My girlfriend ordered the wedge salad with an added chicken breast with a side of au graten potatoes. Her meal was good other than the fact that once she finished 1/4 of her food the wait staff repeatedly asked if we would like a to go box to which I eventually caved and agreed to in order to get out of the dining area. I have been a waiter and bar tender for years to pay my way through law school so I understand when the restaurant is busy. Understanding this I did not feel it was appropriate at the time to complain to the manager. That being said, the service we received was inexcusable. I felt the wait staff was snoody and treated us with minimalistic attention because we were the youngest people in the restaurant. I would advise young couples against a romantic date night here and to try one of the many other options in Charlotte.  It does not matter how long a steak is dry aged when it is cooked to the point of shoe leather. I will never eat at this restaurant again after the disrespect we received on what was supposed to be a romantic and very enjoyable dinner."}
{"text":"First and foremost, I would like to thank you The Capital Grill team for having our Anniversary dinner date so amazing and memorable. Thank you guys for setting up the table and window setting that I requested for my Anniversary surprise for my husband last night. You guys made it so special for us. I would say it was perfect moment for us, the food were so delicious, great service and the ambiance were so romantic. Thank you also for our server last night named \"Erik O'nell\" for the great service.. Thanks also for the complimentary Anniversary dessert. You guys rock! Will come back again and recommend to all our friends.."}
{"text":"I've always noticed the Capital Grille when I went to Biltmore, but thanks to last month's yelp event I finally got a chance to try out some menu items and I've been back twice this month.   It's the kind of place that you want reservations for, but we made a spur of the moment decision on a Friday night and got lucky enough to find a spot to at the bar. The wine menu is extensive, as you would expect it to be for the prices/quality of food. The steak portions are large and the Kona crusted sirloin we ordered was plenty for two (the kitchen split it for us). It was perfectly medium rare. The bread basket and sides were both good, but not the main reason you'd want to come.  Yesterday we went back to try the lunch plates menu and sat in the restaurant area. The service here was spot-on and we were in and out in an hour. Both the burger and mini tenderloin were great choices.  The ricotta cheesecake was a delicious, albeit overfilling, finishing touch.  There's a slight men's-club feeling to the place and I wouldn't describe it as trendy, but I'd have no problems going back for a solid steak."}
{"text":"The Capital Grille is my favorite of the franchised high-end steakhouses.  In Las Vegas, we waited for about 10 minutes for a table & the service was very friendly & attentive.  The restaurant was crowded & noisy (of course, it's Vegas!).    I ordered the ice berg lettuce wedge with blue cheese dressing... the combination of the two was perfect & I finished the whole thing.  I ordered the aged ribeye medium rare and a side of creamed spinach (I know, I'm so old fashioned).  It was the best steak I have had in a very long time.   I just love a really good-quality steak without the bells & whistles...  sorry, some people might want to rub kona coffee on a good steak but that's just blasphemous.  However, there are exceptions... my friend ordered the porchini-rubbed ribeye with balsamic vinegar and he shared slice w/ me... it was out-of-this world!  That's what I'll order next time.  The creamed spinach was also very good... you can taste the quality ingredients. Not the nasty, frozen, formulaic stuff like Boston Market makes.    Overall, if you are looking for an excellent, high-end steak and meal, try The Capital Grille before you go any of the other high-end steakhouses."}
{"text":"This place is exceptional! On 7/7/17 my family and I were celebrating 2 birthdays, and Derek, our server, made the celebration memorable and remarkable. Derek explained the menu items with skill and detailed how each menu item is prepared with scientific specificity. In addition, Derek decorated the table with stars, presented 2 birthday cards to us, and brought us a refreshing tomato, watermelon, cucumber salad. This was a special Birthday appetizer that was on the house. After we finished our entrées, Derek continued the Birthday celebration by bringing us specially prepared desserts. These desserts were: a chocolate gluten free cake and a cheesecake that was everything and more. The manager, Brad, was very friendly and personable. He greeted our table several times throughout the dinner. I highly recommend The Capital Grille. Make sure you ask for Derek when you make your reservation."}
{"text":"Best place to eat in Vegas Bar None! Well worth every penny! Awesome view & great service! We'll see you again soon!"}
{"text":"This steakhouse is atop the Fashion Show Mall with a fantastic view of the the Wynn and views of the Strip.  I started my meal with the salty and sour prosciutto wrapped melted Mozzarella that was evenly balanced with the sweetness of the mini vine ripe tomatoes and crostini.  I also had the garlicky fried calamari with cherry peppers.  It wasn't as spicy as I expected, but the tangy peppers added kick to the calamari.  For a salad, I had to have the stinky stuff....sweet onions on thick slices of tomatoes that was sprinkled with a Vinaigrette and roquefort cheese...so delicious.  I followed this with the Porcini Rubbed Delmonico Steak with 8-Year Aged Balsamic.  I asked for a medium which turned out a little more drier and cooked than I expected.  It seems they run more on the well done side, rather than most restaurants running mor to the rare side.  This brought it down to 3 stars.  I also accompanied the steak with some creamed spinach and potatoes au gratin.  The stars went back to 4 after finishing off with.the most delicious coconut cream pie. Each bite had the crunches of roasted coconut shavings mixed with perfect sweetness of coconut cream.  Oh yeah, this place also serves Samuel Smith Old Brewery Pale Ale."}
{"text":"The food was amazing as always.  The calamari is probably my favorite thing on the menu.  The peppers are the perfect mix of sweet & spicy and the calamari is fried to perfection (a couple of extra seconds can result in rubber tires).  Our server was Angel & she was so sweet.  She was just the right mix of friendly & attentive without hovering or taking away from the dining experience."}
{"text":"Don't always need reservations. Have walked in a few times without reservations. The wine menu is great and the pineapple martini is delicious. The kitchen is very accommodating to allergies. The ribeye is amazing and I also always enjoy a seafood dish such as the salmon."}
{"text":"After running around all darn night and morning getting ready for my vacay I decided to stop in the capital grill for lunch. I was greeted immediately upon my arrival and the hostess stand checked my coat and luggage. It wasn't busy at all for a Thursday afternoon I would have to blame it on the rain because the menu options were superb. I was torn I came in to try out the restaurant week menu but I couldn't take my eyes off the lobster roll and Parmesan truffle . I ordered a goose Bloody Mary which was decent heavy on the goose which I prefer...The bartender Katie was kinda distanced at first but me and another patron got her talking and she warmed up quickly:). As shown in my pics the serving size for the fries and the roll was good for a lunch portion . Now when I think of Parmesan truffle fries I think of shoestring style fries I was presented with thick cut fries with no Parmesan....now don't get me wrong y'all know I haven't met a fry I didn't like . It's just I had a different thing pictured.  The lobster roll could've had more seasoning it was pretty bland The brioche roll was to die for. Was I dissatisfied with my lunch noooo I was way to hungry for that was I blown away... not this time"}
{"text":"We just celebrated our anniversary here the other night and it was outstanding! Top notch service! Everyone was so nice and all wished us a happy anniversary. Our table was covered in rose petals and little hearts when we arrived and had a nice card on the table. Our server Tim was not only an wonderful server, he was full of knowledge on menus and could describe and recommend things to us. I would return here in the future to celebrate many more things!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to spend our anniversary dinner here and we were so happy with the experience. Everything was delicious and the entire staff was wonderful and welcoming and the table was even decorated with a lovely handwritten note and a rose. No less than 5 different staff members stopped by our table to wish us a happy anniversary and check in to see if everything was going well. Our server, Coco, was very friendly, accommodating, and prompt. 10/10 WOULD RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"Amazing service and food. Went here for the wife's bday and they set up the table with decor and had a hand written birthday note when we got there. Would def recommend this place."}
{"text":"I would give zero Stars if I could. The service was incredibly slow took us over three hours to have our dinner. The food was not good at all. This side dishes were all too greasy / buttery, and the steak had absolutely no taste. I had lunch there before and because it was so good I couldn't wait to go back. My husband and I will never go back. We know of many awesome places to drop $250."}
{"text":"While the food is good; it is not great for the price paid.  What truly tarnished a nice night out was the service.  Once the waiter learned that we were not interested in wine service or having him walk us thru his electronic wine list he seemed to have an attitude.  Surly is not a good way to start the night.   I'm sorry even in scottsdale spending $150 a person does not deserve having the waiter turn his nose up at you.  We ordered our first round of drinks and the waiter managed to spill my friend's Cosmo shaker and ended up dripping it down the side of my blouse.  Never said he was sorry.  Entrees were tasty....asparagus was very woody...should have been trimmed or peeled.  Had a similar meal at ocean club on Thanksgiving for about the same price and it was fabulous with the BEST waiter.  Want a nice night out definitely go there instead of capital grill.  Besides wasn't thrilled with having a giant portrait of Barry Goldwater and several stuffed animal \"trophies\" hanging on the wall and watching me eat.  Won't be back...to many other options."}
{"text":"There are few must haves on the menu, but don't save room for dessert, take a few desserts to go for later at home or save them for breakfast.   As could be expected, the filet mignon is amazing and always prepared as ordered. One special note is to look for the dark brown bread containing sweet white raisins in the free bread basket. That bread is something to seek out by itself.  One incredible appetizer is the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella. Every bite leaves you wanting one more.  And take home some dessert. You will be happy you did."}
{"text":"Capital Grill surpasses my expectations.  The lobster Mac and cheese was amazing.  Whatever cheeses are going into that make it worth the order.  I ordered the bone in ribeye with aged balsamic and some sort of mushroom sauce.  In the past these types of flavoring a overpower the steak, but here it was cooked just right.  Really enjoyed my meal.    Additionally service was great despite it being packed.  We were here for my brothers birthday.  Even though it was a busy Friday night they gave him a nice card with confetti on the table.  And also gave a great complimentary dessert with a mini cheesecake and flourless chocolate cake, both tasty even though we were stuffed at this point!"}
{"text":"my boyfriend took me here for my birthday and i had lovely experience. dang the waiter here was just so super! i actually really liked the their grilled mushroom side. that was really really delicious. my steak i wasn't  very impressed with.  it was lovely dining experience but i think i've had better food for the price of the bill.  I'm not complaining on anything i just think at the high end restaurant like this i walk in expecting great service and food, but to say i give 5 will be overrated. i've only had very few 5 star experience and this could well be one of them being in the lovely atmosphere and the service, but i don't think it was a five star food, and even though my steak was cooked the way i wanted it and the decor of the plate was very nice, i've had better steaks, although their sides were surprisingly delicious! i think i think its fair to give 4 stars but i don't know if i'll be back there unless i get invited out."}
{"text":"Great experience. What a night out dining and enjoying the company of friends should be in a refined and thoughtful environment. Strong style references to austere, stoic, masculine, upscale country club, with low lighting and dark cherry wood grain walls. A unique vintage luxury.  The the appetizers and entrees reflect that class of dining. A feeling of power and fulfillment in the company of friends that makes you wish you could as for and select an appropriate cigar, sit back and watch the other patrons and listen to your friends."}
{"text":"This is by far my most favorite restaurant! The service is impeccable and the food is awesome! I've celebrated my birthday here and special occasions. I experienced issues with one of my reservations and the hostess helped me out and provided me stellar service."}
{"text":"This is by far my most favorite restaurant! The service is impeccable and the food is awesome! I've celebrated my birthday here and special occasions. The Capital Grille definitely lives up to its expectations."}
{"text":"The lobster mac n cheese is to die for!  Steaks are always cooked to perfection, very consistently, slow or busy times.  Great service, great food, nice wine list...what more could you ask for? Well, maybe chocolate lava cake!"}
{"text":"Had a late lunch here on 3 May, 2017.  Gina was our server.  Gina, Gina, Gina - thanks for the great service, and playful banter!  The food was excellent.  I ate the steak Oscar, and the wife had a Cobb salad with sirloin steak.  This was an excellent meal, with superior service - basically everything one looks for in a Vegas experience.  On the way out I told Gina that my wife recommended a 7% tip, at which time Gina told me \"don't get hit by any cars on the strip\" (thankfully none hit me).  Gina got slightly more than 7% - as I was only kidding, and so was she.  I'm pretty sure we both had as much fun as adults can have while keeping their clothes on.  I would definitely return to this establishment."}
{"text":"The best steak in town New York strip was cooked to Perfection medium rare arugula salad was not even on the menu but they made us one with shaved Parmesan cheese and tomatoes awesome"}
{"text":"Now this is what a Vegas steak and seafood place should look like.  Soaring exterior, interior a mix of Frank Lloyd Wright and Stargate Atlantis, view right down the strip.  Servers in bow ties and very businesslike.  We went for the Mahi mahi and the seared citrus salmon. The sauce on the Mahi had an odd mineral flavor.  Not a flaw just not to my taste.  The salmon, always on the menu, was just to my taste.  The French beans and heirloom tomatoes were great.  And don't fail to look at the back page of the wine book (not just the list inside the menu) for the promotions.  Anything that they bought in volume and is not selling during the downturn is about 50% off.  The Byron Pinot was a bargain at $49.  It's easy to get in at 6:30, but by 8pm, even on a weeknight, it's packed."}
{"text":"Excellent food and drinks. My steak was perfect, med-rare. The staff is friendly and attentive. There seems to be an older crowd when I go. The atmosphere is nice. Make sure to use your table manners here. It's pricey, but it's to be expected from an upscale restaurant and well worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing!  We came in for Thanksgiving dinner and were not disappointed. From the lobster & crab cakes (2 come in an order we added a 3rd so we could each have one thank goodness because we would have been fighting over them) the scallops (like butta) the turkey dinner which was a very generous portion of turkey & mashed potatoes - to the great wine list and our AWESOME server Jeannie L I can't wait to go back and try everything else on the menu.   The pumpkin cheesecake to end the night was the best way to finish up a lovely meal."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant downtown. When you first arrive take advantage of the free valet parking. Finding a place to park around the restaurant is not enjoyable and when you have free valet, take advantage of it.  We have always made a reservation, never had any problems. I'm not sure how it works with walk-in's but i'm sure they would do their best to accommodate.  The service is wonderful. The wine list is amazingly large. They have a glass room in the dining room where you can see all the wines by bottle that they have. It's a menu in itself.  The menu is al-a-carte so it can get pricey especially when adding on wine.   Chopped Salad is delicious. They have a olive vinaigrette dressing with it that is outstanding. I would continually go back here just for this salad.   The dry aged steaks are very good. The filet Oscar is excellent.  Truffle fries and the lobster mac and cheese are to die for. You cannot leave here without trying them."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to get a top-notch meal. Their aged steaks are cooked and seasoned to perfection. It is extremely pricey, but the size of the meat and savory taste is well worth it. This place is great for special occasion and couples. A couple will easily spend $200."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. I had a steak that was to die for. The restaurant is a little darker than I would like however and if you go in casual clothes they treat you like your less important than their usual guests. We had an early dinner here with family. A total of 5 guests and they put us at the worst table they had right next to the waiters station. We asked to be moved but were told that the other tables in the restaurant were reserved even though we had a reservation as well. Nobody came in the entire time we were there either so I personally felt like they didn't think we would spend money because we were dressed casually so they put us at a bad table even though we did not cheap out on any of our orders and left a good tip.  3 stars for judging people when you shouldn't."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed it. Not over priced for what it is. Was it the best steak I've ever eaten, no, but it was damn good. Starters and sides were huge and very tasty. There's an excellent wine tasting offer $28 for four different types of Red or White, wines were mostly very good and a great deal at $28 for as much as you want. Will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Came here on Valentine's Day with a big group of 16 and had an amazing time. Service was amazing and loved the view of the strip. I had gotten the ribeye with the 15 year old aged balsamic. I've never had such an amazing deal. It was so flavorful and soft. Reasonably priced. $50-60 a plate. All sides are a la carte. The mashed potatoes were so creamy.This restaurant is a gem! One of my favorites. We'll be coming back again."}
{"text":"The food and service is top notch. I get the same thing every time and it's awesome. Porcini Custer Delmonico, lobster mac and cheese, and creamed spinach. Add some bourbon and I'm in heaven. My wife and I go here for every birthday, anniversary, New Years, etc. Love it!"}
{"text":"I've heard great things about the food but I was disappointed. We had a reservation, arrived on time but were not seated for 20 minutes. Service was friendly and knowledgable but it took forever to get our entrees - about 45 minutes AFTER our appetizer was finished and gone. I ordered Steak Oscar and I'm pretty sure they had grill running WAY too hot - my steak was crispified on the outside and rare on the inside. The desserts were the highlight of the meal and they had a good selection of wines by the glass. My first impression: overpriced and overrated."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night fantastic atmosphere and views of the strip. The staff was very nice and attentive. Food was excellent , the Prosciutto wrapped mozzarella was wonderful, Steak cooked to perfection, Lobster, Asparagus and Lobster Mac n Cheese. Even though I never eat coconut cream pie theirs was Divine it is THE best dessert I have ever had! Hands down. I highly suggest you give this restaurant a try if you like fine dining please try The Capitol Grille."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here last night. Our waiter Shawn was super! The crab cakes, lobster mac and cheese dish were delicious."}
{"text":"The whole experience was wonderful. I was a little worried when we got there because we asked to be seated somewhere else and the hostess was definitely not happy about it. When we pay good money for a meal I expect the best of service. Our waiter, Travis, was the best. Very knowledgeable and courteous. I would love to have him again when we return.  We had their speciality pineapple vodka soaked cocktail. Delicious.  We ordered two appetizers, the crab cakes and calamari with spicy peppers. Both tasted wonderful. I would suggest eating the crab cakes first because the peppers from the calamari slightly took over my palate. The bread basket they served was elegant and the butter very fresh and tasty.  Dinner was tenderloin with lobster tail with two sides of creamed corn and bacon and the roasted mushrooms. Simple, tasty, and went well with the meat.  We finished off the evening with coffee (was SO happy it was piping hot and strong) and dessert, flourless chocolate espresso cake and the coconut cream cake! Both were absolutely to die for, and a must have. Great evening."}
{"text":"The decor, food, and service are outstanding. It is on the more expensive side, especially for dinner. Do lunch if you want the experience yet need to moderate your costs."}
{"text":"A welcome respite from the holiday shopping crowds. This is a realtively new addition to the area (so I'm told) and I'm happy to have found it here. Definitely a cut above other offerings in the area. I especially appreciate the jazz music. I recommend the signature Stoli Doli cocktail. Service is generally uneven in this city, but I have to hand it to the staff here. I want to compliment Amanda for making this out-of-town guest feel right at home. I will be sure to visit again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. This is the most delicious place I've been to for a looong time. Bone-in Kona with Au Gratin Potatoes is heavenly. Absolutely got hooked on this place. (And I do go to nice places a lot..)"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. I've been here for both lunch and dinner.  My favorite thing to get for lunch is the Dry Aged Sirloin salad. I was surprised at the amount of steak provided. It's a pretty generous amount.  The clam chowder, wedge salad, and Bone-in Kona crusted dry aged sirloin are all also beyond tasty. As for dessert, the creme brulee and the fresh strawberries Capital Grille are all sure to satisfy your sweet tooth.  Service is excellent. Not as stuffy as I would expect a place like this to be, which I appreciate.  I'd eat here way more often, if only my wallet would allow."}
{"text":"Based on special WIne Tasting event @ Bar.  {Otherwise i could NEVER see how i could/would dine here - case in point: initially seated in dinning room. Took quite a while to have our (very snotty & uppity) server apporach us.  We inidicated we were doing their special event, and OMG did he ever show he did NOT want any part of THAT with US}  We (ThankFully) asked to be moved to lounge area which only had 2 other tables being served.  (I just KNEW we would have had a more than terrible  time with Mr. Crabby Pants had we stayed in his section).  We were promptly moved, seated & served in very quick succession.  Turned out BEST decsion.  We were given professional & informative tastings of wines from Napa & South Africa.    Although this was a fun, different and good little event, and we really enjoyed it, it was NO where near as great an experience that we had at the CG in North Scottsdale 2 weeks earlier, ie: NITE and DAY difference.  (pours were half the size, and they were extremely hesitant, if at all, to give another taste of 1 which u may have liked....  I WOULD go back to N. Scottsdale for a Wine & Dine but i would never suggest getting a \"10\" on the Snob-O-Factor here."}
{"text":"Had the BEST wine tasting experince in my life.  (and i've had QUITE a few).  This was experienced in their swanky bar area, in a sexy booth.   Oscar, you were BEYOND your beck and call.  Seriously, you were amazing, informative, helpful, professional, the whole package deal.  Your Service Was Impecable.  So, we had about 12 wines to choose from, 1/2 from Napa, 1/2 from South Africa.  And we are NOT talking 1oz pours here, they were given in beautiful, large crystal goblets.  (I so hate little wine glass which sell for 25 cents).  (and yes, we had them ALL :-)  These were free poured, let me tell you!  And they gave a great little booklet of the wine, year, description to keep and log your tasting notes.    Hubby and I played hookie on this beautful Thursday afternoon, and it was divine.    I sure hope they have this even again, cuz i am so THERE.  Oh, i guess i should mention we did have some food - haha - the crispy roasted half chicky was YUM, and so were the truffle fries - omg."}
{"text":"Great view, delicious food, nice service, reasonable pricing.  All in my party had wine, various steaks, a few sides and an after dinner drink.  Total came to $120/head, all in.  Reasonable.  I had an 8oz fillet that was topped with approx 3oz of deliciously fresh crab meat that just had a hint of a delicious sauce.  What a great combo.  Not revolutionary, but the steak came out perfect to my order (M-rare) and was of very high quality beef.  Definitely a top 10 steak for me of all time.    Please request a strip view and take some time to look over the well stocked wine list.   You will be right across from the Wynn and have a beautiful sight in front of you.  This was the beginning of our Vegas trip and set things off right."}
{"text":"Having eaten at the other upscale steakhouse chains such as Morton's, Ruth's Chris, etc., we pretty much had our expectations in check prior to visiting The Capital Grille for the first time.  We ate at the bar, which was quite nice.  Had the Calamari appetizer, which was quite good.  Calamari was fresh, and it was very tasty overall (served with jalapeno peppers).  Later sampled the Crabcake appetizer, which was very nice as well.  The bread selection was excellent.  Went with the 10 oz filet, which was perfectly cooked (Medium +), butterflied, and extra blackened.  While I would have preferred a bit more seasoning, it was a perfect cut of meat, again - perfectly cooked.  Exceeded my expectation.  Had the Lobster-Mac, which was decent, but a little underwhelming.  We have had similar Mac dishes elsewhere, and have been more impressed (Truluck in Florida and Birches in Baltimore).  Also tried the Filet Oscar, and was not nearly as impressed.  Felt it wasn't cooked properly (also Medium +, but not butterflied, which may have accounted for this difference).  Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner. Had the filet been seasoned a bit more, I might have gone with 5 stars."}
{"text":"Used to be great.  For how pricey the food is, it lacks flavor.  Filet was over cooked, and definitely not worth the money.  Not sure if I will return."}
{"text":"A nearly perfect dinner. My husband and I took my meat and potato loving parents to Capital Grille for restaurant week. The service was impeccable. Our waiter was knowledgable and very accommodating. I don't eat meat and hate salmon which were the options for restaurant week. He got me bass.It was so good. It was perfectly cooked and seasoned to perfection. . The lobster mac and cheese was great as a side. It was creamy and not fishy. The calamari appetizer was perfect. It had peppers which made it spicy. My husband and parents got the prime rib and said it was great. The meal was expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD and SUPERIOR DINING EXPERIENCE well worth the money.  The service is attentive and exceptional.  The wine and cocktails are boozey and top notch.  This chain knows what it's doing.  You won't leave disappointed."}
{"text":"This was absolutely outstanding! You can have a floor to ceiling view of the Strip while you dine.  Perfect ambience for conversing, no loud music. Our server, Jeff, was excellent, always there when we wanted him, but never bugging us.  The food was perfect, done exactly as we wished. The sides are large and meant for sharing.  This will be my new go to place for fine dining in a relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amelia, our server, was excellent! The food was better than at some of the Food Network chefs' restaurants we also ate at. The attention to detail, including a personalized birthday card, was overwhelming. Best restaurant I've been to anywhere."}
{"text":"Every time my wife and I eat here we are always appreciative of the excellent service and consistently outstanding food.  We have never ordered anything that we did not thoroughly enjoy."}
{"text":"On a rare night out with my wife, when our daughter's in the capable hands of others, we made reservations for the Capital Grille.   Having eaten there before, courtesy of someone else's expense account, I readily knew what we were in for; a throwback to the dining days where the wait staff dressed formally (and wore name tags), and the interior was tastefully decorated in rich mahogany and imported leather, where an above-average steak can be savored and where the bartender truly knows how to mix a quality martini. In other words, this place oozes of old money, but you don't have to dress to the nines in order to enjoy service here; as long as you don't dress like you're about to attend a GWAR concert, you won't be denied service.  Our attentive waitress, Beth, could not have been more instrumental in helping us decide what to eat. I was jonesing for a good red wine, but I wasn't much in the mood to down an entire bottle on my own (my wife doesn't like red wine, and I don't like white, so that negates our wine choosing); she recommended a rich and full-bodied Rioja by the glass, so smooth and elegant that I would have enjoyed another glass were I more inclined to do so.  We started with the prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella, lightly sauteed and garnished with fresh basil and vine tomatoes. Absolutely lovely, and the prosciutto is from Parma, and not the poser variety most restaurants and delis try to pawn off on you. The crostinis were a delight as well. My wife also enjoyed a wedge salad with a tangy blue cheese dressing.  As for the main event, my wife chose the lobster and crab-stuffed shrimp; think of this as looking akin to a stuffed tomato, lightly glazed and very delicious. I went for the steak Au Poivre, rubbed with peppercorns and served with a cognac (Courvoisier?) sauce. Oh. My. GOODNESS! Tender, with a swift bite to it, thanks to the peppercorns. We shared a neatly-prepped side of sauteed spinach, and the parmesan truffle fries; this was perhaps the only disappointment, as the fries seemed to lack the prerequisite amount of parmesan so as to not make the fries taste like, well, fries.  We topped off our gastric orgy with an off-the-menu layered carrot cake, large enough for two. There was no way we could finish it, but, man, we gave it our best.  $180 for dinner? Yeah, so what? It was SO WORTH IT!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch sites. Easy to get in. Great service. Excellent options making it difficult to choose. Andy was my waiter. He's first class."}
{"text":"I brought my boyfriend here to celebrate his 21 birthday. From the moment of booking reservation to dinner everything was splendid. The hostesses prepared a beautiful booth with a few topped with confetti & b-day card. Our server did his job, but nothing out of the world to remember his name. The girl server assistant was wonderful. I really can't remember her name? She made sure we had everything we need. I'm surprised she's not a server yet. We started of with the cold fish platte. OMG! it was so good. The oysters are fantastic. We had the spinach salad/ filet mignon/ Porter house. We got auto gratin potatoes/ lobster Mac n cheese/mushrooms. All very tasty. Overall love the experience."}
{"text":"Why would I go to a restaurant and hope for the worst?  Because I'm a snob and as a snob I was convinced that The Capital Grille would fall short of my extremely high expectations.  Not so.  Bread basket: Outstanding onion bread, a pumpernickel/golden raisin bread, and some crisp cracker bread.  Nice all around.  Extensive wines by the bottle with some great values to be had.  I did not check by the glass.  Our wine was decanted artfully at our table and the staff had a ready knowledge of the vineyard and year we had selected.  Husband had:  Oysters -  Blue point tonight, small this time of year so no big surprise there, well prepared and delicious.  Lamb chop - Perfectly flavored and cooked, Frenched, the definition of how to prepare and cook a lamb chop perfectly.  Potato Au Gratin - Typical steakhouse Au gratin.  Excellent flavor, huge portion, guaranteed to please a crowd (or anyone that loves a delicious cheesy crusted potato).  I had:  Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarella - You can't imagine how good this is....a lovely thin slice of prosciutto cooked to crisp perfection wrapped around a fresh piece of mozzarella cheese, with just the right amount of melt but not escaping the prosciutto shell.  A parmesan toast and tomato salad round this out.  You might as well as shaved gold on the side.  Sliced filet - I'm not going to go into detail, just know that the answer is YES! (Is it fantastic? Is it cooked to perfection? Is the flavor wonderful? Is it a great cut?)  Asparagus with Hollendaise - Awesome stuff.  Nice to have a great hollendaise that I didn't have to prepare.  Service - Our server was so outstanding I'm going to contact the manager at this location.  Atmosphere - We had a corner table that gave us great privacy.  We could not hear our neighbors."}
{"text":"Service was top notch, and setting was even better.   I have no complaints.  Bring lots of money, though, in fact if you are even thinking of trying not to spend too much, this is not the place.    Wish I could afford to dine here regularly."}
{"text":"We went to Capital Grille on Tuesday night.  It turned out to be their opening day.  We made reservations on OpenTable and were seated at a nice booth.  The booth was so large, though, that the servers had to hand us our food to set down ourselves.  Not a problem, just unusual.  The food was delicious - kona rubbed bone-in strip and sliced filet - both cooked perfectly.  The Brussels spouts for a side were tasty as well.  The service was excellent (our server was Mark).  Mark asked us how our weekend was and we mentioned that we had celebrated our anniversary.  He surprised us with dessert on a plate that had \"happy anniversary\" written in chocolate.  Both desserts were wonderful - cheesecake and flourless torte.  We will return.  Recommend it for a special dinner."}
{"text":"Top notch!  The food is always fantastic. The staff is very professional but not stuffy.  Love the rich wood decor"}
{"text":"Service is terrible on easter!!!!!   I come her all the time and never have any issues but today has truly been an awful experience!!!!!  3 hours to eat and I have a bunch of kids with me how awful!!!!  I hope this is just a bad experience and not the usual for Easter!!!!"}
{"text":"Went to this place with my colleagues as were in town for work. We had to drive around twice to get the valet parking as the place was packed. This was sign that a right place was picked for dinner.  Food- We were eight people so ordered a lot of items from each section so get ready to read a long review!   Appetizers: Pan fried Calamari with hot cherry peppers- As the name suggests it was hot. It was not too crispy and little on the softer side. But the flavor and taste was really good. I would give it 4/5 because I like calamari a little crispy. There is no sauce that comes with it so if you want one,you need to ask. A few of my co-workers could not handle the spice so if you don't eat medium spicy,this is not for you!  Pork belly with tomato jam- the portion was really small like really small which was good I think as the dish was not too good in taste. It tasted soggy and the tomato jam was overpowering the bacon taste. I would not recommend it personally.  Truffle fries- I would say that this was my favorite out of all the appetizers! A must try! The portions are not too bad either and good enough to share with 2-3 people.  Brussels sprouts with bacon- Perfect amount of oil and flavor. Nothing too fancy or unique, if you don't want anything else then sure go for it otherwise there are better options like the fries!  They also serve various kinds of breads which also fills you up so decide your appetizers accordingly.  Main course:  I do not eat steak so I decided to go with Chilean sea bass with mushroom soy broth- it was good, the broth had a nice aroma and was tasting perfect with the fish! So if you like something with not too much spices, do not eat steak and want something very neutral in taste and easy to finish then I would recommend this.  My co-workers ordered steak but they had one comment in common that even medium rare was overdone which reduced the juice and flavor. I have no comments on that as I know nothing about steak!  Sides: - Lobster Mac and cheese- The lobster comes in giant pieces mixed in Mac and cheese. I was expecting very small pieces mixed well in Mac and cheese but that was not the case. The taste was good, top was crispy, and it's Mac and cheese (I don't know what else to say). Definitely recommended!  - Mashed potatoes - it made a good side for people who ordered steak as Steak does not come with any side. It was good and definitely worth getting if you are getting steak.  - Asparagus - I thought it was very oily so I couldn't eat more than one bite. I could taste the oil.   Dessert: - New York cheese cake - We ordered that because they had no more Creme Brûlée but the top part tasted exactly the same. 4/5  - Warm Double chocolate cake- it's chocolate lava cake with ice cream on the side. I love chocolate so I would say that this was my fav dessert! 5/5  - Fruit sorbet - I did not like it much, found it too tangy but I guess it's because I am not a sorbet fan. But there are better options in my opinion so why go for this!  - Trio of handcrafted ice creams- This does not come with \"cookies\" as the description says! There was this one biscotti looking cookie that is very hard to break and three ice creams with one scoop each.   Drinks- They have a good wine list! I got the Cabernet - \"Frank\" , liked it!   Overall comments - The service was great, ambience was really good, good music in the background , our server was very attentive and very honest about the recommendations. I would definitely recommend it as a good place for a special occasion, date night, or work lunches/dinners. It is definitely pricey but the service, food, ambience is equal to the price.   Sorry, I only have 2 pictures to share - My main course and the chocolate dessert!   Cheers and live,laugh and love!"}
{"text":"I ate at this restraurant on Tuesday,August 2nd about 6;00pm since it was close to treasure island hotel where I was staying for a few days and I decided to have a nice dinner while in Vegas.     I have to say the service was very good and had a table next to the window. The issue was with the filet mignon I ordered  for 50.00 and is just the meat a la cart. On my first bite I found it dry with no taste and not what I was expecting for 50.00!  I did order a Caesar salad for an additional 12.00 but was just a Caesar salad , nothing special. I should have refused this order at that time but by the time I had my dinner the restaurant was busy .."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife while on vacation in Scottsdale for our 22nd wedding anniversary. It is quite an upscale restaurant with prices and service to match. I ordered lobster bisque (excellent) and lamb chops and my wife ordered the filet with Gorgonzola and Cabernet reduction. My wife described her meal as perfect, while my chops were more rare than I preferred and with a lot of gristle, but flavor was excellent.  We had grilled asparagus and smashed potatoes for sides (served family style), that were both excellent. Since it was our anniversary they had the table decorated, gave us a complimentary dessert that was awesome (plate had \"happy anniversary\" written in chocolate) and a complimentary photo. Overall the Restaurant was excellent for food, service, and wine selection, but quite pricey (4 of 5 stars is for value)"}
{"text":"Hosted 10 guest last night.  Service was slow, they were understaffed.  Steaks were tough, and the fish lacked taste.  Will think twice to come here again.  Hosted another party at Del Frisco's the night before, and they did a great job.  Service and food were spot on."}
{"text":"Wonderful time had here. The services and food was tasty and enjoyed the cocktails too. Never a bad meal whenever I'm here."}
{"text":"This place is classy .. Ambiance is good .. Service is good too .. I'm not a wine person .. But if you are it's good .. Food -- quantity is good .. I tried calamari .. Which was good. Trio miniature ice cream - ice cream was good , but the cookies served with that was not good .. I kinda of dint like the way they served water ..  But overall this place is ok . I don't want to go back again ."}
{"text":"We have been to capital grill countless times. The food is always terrific. The service is always great. We went in tonight for our 5 year wedding anniversary. They asked us when we walked in if we were celebrating anything and we told them. We waited for a few minutes and they quickly put together a table with rose pedals and a card. We thought that was a very nice gesture and we ordered our meal which I mentioned was terrific.  After our meal they brought us 2 glasses of champagne. Another nice gesture, after, they brought us a mini desert that was delicious, and they also took a nice photo that they printed and gave to us before we left. I love this restaurant and even if they just gave us a card and rose pedals it made us feel special, but they went above and beyond to a point that there is no doubt that any celebration will be at the capital grill. Couldn't have been more pleased it was just a great evening. Thanks everyone!"}
{"text":"People who really appreciate delicious, well prepared food will be quite satisfied with this restaurant. The ambience is classy and sophisticated with upscale decor. This place is wonderful especially for celebrating special occasions. My husband and I recently went there for his birthday. The staff made sure that the table was decorated for the occasion. Also a nice birthday card was placed on the table for him. Based on prior reviews, we tried the lobster mac and cheese. It was fabulous. Also the steaks were in the top 2 that we've ever had anywhere. In addition the service was excellent. We're looking forward to returning to Capital Grille soon."}
{"text":"Not only fabulous food and ambiance, but a wonderful spot to host sophisticated and impressive client dinners. We dined this week with a large group and the food and service couldn't have been better. Rocco was our main waiter and simply amazing, as were all of the staff that we encountered including the lovely manager and Allison, the wine manager. 5 Stars!!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner for three. Waitress was suburb. Had drinks first then a great French wine upgraded by the som. Had a fine bone in filet prepared as ordered. Other steaks also just as ordered. Usual side were as excepted. Great service, food and wine make for a perfect evening. Nice cream brûlée to finish"}
{"text":"I went to this place 12 years ago with my dad when I was 16 and was in heaven.  At 16 and being from the country side, you can imagine how great it was for me, a young teen who already eats like a goat.  My wife and I went on restaurant week and maybe it was due to price, but the steak was plain to me.  I was disappointed because I was expecting wow.  Guess I need to pick from regular menu instead of restaurant week menu!  Everything else was great though.  I will come back again because I know it is stiil a great place."}
{"text":"More posh than Posh, Capital Grille is the stuffy resturant that will totally get you laid. lol..., the food is good, the service is TOP notch. I cannot even begin to tell you!! ARGH! I'm getting ahead of myself... *deep breath* Let me begin...  It was Resturant Week and me and my neighbor Sharrita chose to come here for a couple of reasons: Meat and Creme Brulee. What ever homesick girl needs to feel better. :)  We entered the very clean and classy and dare i say it - swanky setting with their hostesses who ware blazers and they were very welcoming and were very glad to seat a yelper. (they asked how I heard about Resturant Week when I called for reservations) Our waiter - dang I can't remember his name! he was so attentative and had one of those table sweeper type thingies and he recommended I try the best drink of the night - the Stoli Doli. Fresh pineapple stewed with Stoli vodka for atleast a WEEK before it's dispensed for sweet drink lovers (like me) smooth, delicious and slightly sweet. I was in love.   We had standard salads, nothing to write yelp about. I had the Filet Mingon and she had this steak that was sliced in half (if I remember) it came with veggies, again nothing to really write yelp about but everything was so yummy. The steak was well rested and cooked perfectly. I was very impressed.    One slight issue: we saw creme brulee on the menu on  the resturant week's website but when we got to the resturant, it wasn't there - boo... but our ever amazing waiter worked it out for us! YAY!! Thank Goodness he did because it was insanely good.  If you want a place that is swank, seriously fancy (I'm from the rez okay - so this is crazy fancy in my world)  and has GREAT service and even better steak... this is the place for you! But you better have the cash to pay for it all! lol but if you have the money honey and a need to wine and dine then trust me sweetie Capital Grille has the time! Just call ahead for reservations!"}
{"text":"Well, well... I thought I knew what a good cheesecake was. It was quite wonderful to be proven wrong.  That aside, lovely ambiance, a professional and courteous staff, delicious food that not only didn't disappoint, but went above and beyond my expectations. I'll make a very minor complaint and note that there was a bit of banging noise by where I was seated, probably coming from the kitchen-- it wasn't terribly loud so it didn't bother me much, though it was fairly consistent throughout the meal. Other than that bit of nitpicking, though... I can't think of a reason I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Steak was some what tuff for the price. Had the spinach and had to add salt for flavor. They measured my $20.00 glass of wine to the tee. Wedged salad was fantastic. Service was good but for me this is not a place I will rush back too. Perhaps a little over rated."}
{"text":"This place and the service was amazing! The meal, ambience and people was worth every penny! Charles was amazing and very attentive.  I recommend this place to everyone! The lamb chops were to DIE for and so was the coconut creme pie! I love this place and will be back."}
{"text":"My family and I visited for lunch during Pittsburgh Restaurant Week.   Our reservation was confirmed through the OpenTable app, and we were politely greeted and promptly seated upon arrival.  Although there was quite a difference in the restaurant week pricing versus the actual menu prices, service and quality were not compromised.    Unfortunately, the field greens and tomato salad listed on the restaurant week website had been changed to a wedge salad at the restaurant.  Since I don't eat pork or like blue cheese, I opted for the only other selection of clam chowder.  I never eat clam chowder (personal preference) but I was actually pleased with the taste and consistency.  For the entree course, we all ordered the dry aged sirloin with roasted pepper, fresh mozzarella, and arugula salad - wow!  My one complaint is that my steak was a bit underdone, but I switched with my brother who didn't mind a more rare steak.  The steak was a quality cut of beef, and the side dish was the perfect accompaniment.  For dessert, we all opted for the creme brûlée with fresh berries.  This dessert selection was another deviation from the online menu, but a pleasant surprise since it was absolutely delicious.  I've visited other Pittsburgh steakhouses that boast the same quality and service as The Capital Grille, but none can compare to this experience.  My parents didn't stop talking about this meal for weeks, and even tried to replicate it at home.  Thank you for a great experience!  P.S.- I've already booked a reservation for my parent's upcoming anniversary."}
{"text":"Our waiter who's name was Chris was such a Ahole!! Whenever he decided to make an appearance at our table which didnt happen very often he was very rude and condescending. Most of the night we had to order drinks from other Waiters as they walked passed our table because Chris was out smoking butts. Also after we ordered 4+ bottles of average priced wine for the table he said \"you must be cheap and want a hangover\"!! It was a $1,400 bill!! F him!! Definitely do not recommend this Capital grill"}
{"text":"This place is bootleg.  Been to several Capital Grille's and imo, the only one worth visiting more than once is in Boston.  I will say the steak is good and this place would earn 3-4 stars in other cities, but in comparing it to other LV steakhouses, it's a 2.     Other minor dig - it has way too much of an \"expense account\" vibe - definitely not conducive to a fun Vegas evening."}
{"text":"When we first started going to Capital Grill, I was really blown away by the quality of the food and the care they put into all elements of the dining experience. Not much has changed.  STEAK: We ordered the wrong steaks tonight. It has clearly been a while since we've been here. After consulting with our waiter, we we ordered the ribeye, NOT the porcini rubbed rib eye that we love. I ordered my steak \"medium rare plus\". I like that label. I tried to explain to the waiter that I wanted my steak between medium and medium rare. When the waiter appeared confused, I told him that if the steak wasn't medium, I'd rather they erred on the side of medium rare than medium well. He THEN suggested medium rare plus. I don't eat steak out very often, so that designation may be common knowledge to others. It was new to me. The meat was...a bit off tonight, but I chalk that up to my disappointment at not having the right steak. It was cooked nicely and seasoned well, but I was not a fan of something I tasted in the beef and the sauce that accompanied it.  SIDE DISHES: We had a salad, potatoes au gratin, and green beans. We skipped their delicious calamari and seafood platter. Everything was done well. The potatoes were a tad bit under seasoned, but certainly nothing to worry about.   SERVICE: This is where CG usually shines. But not so much tonight. Good establishments can have an off night, or an off employee. But when you come to a place like this, you are expecting polished service. The host was a Professional (capital P). He was on the phone, dealing with clients, directing the secondary host, and organizing the tables around a large party in the venue. All at the same time.  The bussers were attentive and one woman even came and refolded my husband's napkin while he was away from the table. I like all of those touches. The waiter was well meaning, but not up to CG standards. Little things like drinks being poured in the wrong glasses (not our waiter's fault), missed oppotunities for menu clarification, or knowing the daily specials don't amount to much. Unless a guest is less than excited about her meal.  WHAT HAS CHANGED: I don't know if I have changed or CG has. I never saw Capital Grill as a modern \"old school\" steak house before. I did tonight. The dishes were all very typical and expected, but there was a heaviness and lack of ingenuity to the meal. I know a steakhouse isn't looking to wow its customers with modern twists on old standbys, but the food should be impeccable. Beautifully seasoned and cooked. Even though I was directed to the wrong steak, it should have been the best quality meat and  the steak should have stood up on its own. I wasn't and it didn't.    VALET: It's a mess and they will have you waiting in the heat to pick up your car. Not good, but not CG's fault.  Capital Grill has an old-school feel. The decor is modern and sleek, but the offerings reflect more of what Vegas was than what it is today.  In spite of that, CG is still a solid choice for a delicious meal. A flawed meal a CG is still head and shoulders above many other places in town.   I will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE their Cheesecake, it's our absolute favorite! Every time we go there we're greeted with friendly people even though we only order our cheesecakes to go. The bartenders who take our order are great and get our orders out quickly! Can't wait to actually sit down for a nice dinner soon!"}
{"text":"Ending my three days in charlotte with a superb ny strip steak with simply astonishing flavor. This place serves an elite steak that would hard to equal or best anywhere. I have never been impressed with the sides steak houses serve and The Capital does not distinguish itself in this area either. The Malbec they carry by the glass was well above average (Catena 2013) and the chocolate icecream a true winner. I rarely visit steak houses but was glad i decided to risk it this time. Memorable!"}
{"text":"As a repeat diner at several Capital Grille establishments across the country, I've come to set my expectations pretty high.  I have been disappointed before and I have been pleased.  Last Friday night was the latter.  We had 7 people in our little group and the staff and the service were exceptional and the food and wine was great.  Many thanks CG !!  We will be back."}
{"text":"Fancy pants alert! This place was well worth the money. Made reservations and were seated right away.  The bread that came out before was delicious. They had probably 5-6 different types of bread in a basket, so if you're picky about your grains, you have options. A friend and I split the Delmonico steak and Lobster Mac & Cheese (AND an entire bottle of wine... YOLO!) I appreciate that the staff here knew we were splitting, so they came out with the steak cut in half for us. The food was great! Steak was cooked perfectly and the Lobster Mac & Cheese was not lacking in lobster and was probably the best lobster mac & cheese I've ever had in my entire life (I've only had it about maybe 4 times, though). We were so stuffed afterwards.   I docked one star because of an incident we saw while they were seating another table. The couple was seated in a booth that did not have place settings, so I believe it was the manager at the time that shot the server a nasty look, kind of like \"Why the hell would you seat them there. Are you dumb?\" I kind of felt bad for the server because there was nothing she could do. It almost felt degrading. And on top of that, the manager wasn't hiding her emotions. Basically anyone in the restaurant could have seen it happen. If you have constructive criticism, do it behind closed doors. Not where people can openly see you treat someone with a nasty attitude. Hope the employees here are treated well!"}
{"text":"Manager is idiot. Had 4 meals(left-overs) that were thrown away and was given free app on next visit. Good luck getting me BACK!! :( save money Flemings is better!H"}
{"text":"Service was impeccable (Dominic) the filet was prepared perfectly. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food and wine tasted excellent when my party of 4 ate here in early January, but two of us ended up with food poisoning afterwards - we shared the warm spinach salad with bacon that evening. It's too bad because I would have given a 4 star rating otherwise."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to a Capital Grill. The people and service were very good. But we were a bit disappointed with the food.   From the beginning:  - the complimentary shrimp small plate was very tasty, a good start.  - my Caesar salad was nothing special. My wife's felt her wedge was overpowered by the dressing but I thought it was ok. It was large. Consider sharing.  - we both considered seafood but got the delmonico med rare. It was cooked appropriately but was not exceptionally tasty - the asparagus side was burned. It was replaced with a better prepared dish - they brought a complimentary lobster Mac and cheese because we weren't fond of the Caesar salad. Nice. But it was fairly dry.  - a complimentary crime brûlée was served for my birthday. I love creme brûlée but this was denser than I like.   Again, the servers and manager were very nice and accommodating. But for us the food was only ok."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service. The waiter accused me of working there when I clearly did not. I was trying to enjoy a night out with my girlfriend. I will not be returning because of such rude service...."}
{"text":"I took some Business Clients to Capital Grill and what an Amazing Place to go for a great Meal. The Service was some of the best I have had and their food even better. I would recommend them to anyone."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here Sunday night for dinner during Restaurant Week.  Obviously, we made reservations in advance and were seated immediately.   We decided to order a bottle of wine cause we were celebrating that evening. All the wines are on a tablet, which was really neat cause you could easily scroll through the bottles and filter. We ended up settling on a Zin/Shiraz blend. It was absolutely delish....I wish I got the name of it!  Since we were dining for restaurant week ($35 per person), the menu was limited. However, I would love to return cause I heard their lobster mac was fantastic! I decided on the clam chowder, 8oz filet mignon, and chocolate flourless espresso cake. My husband picked the wedge salad, ribeye (i think it was crazy big like 14 oz) and chocolate flourless cake.   Unfortunately, the clam chowder wasn't anything special. I have a huge love for chowders and this one simply didnt do anythign for me. I took a bite of my husbands salad and it was very good. Our steaks came out next. They were cooked absolutely perfectly! The filet mignon literally melted in my mouth. My husbands steak was seasoned so well. This is definitely where Capital Grille shined! The shared potatoes that came with it were perfect. Additionally, the meal came with shared green beans. I thought the green beans weren't cooked enough, but that is just a personal preference. The taste was excellent though. Lastly, the desserts. Oh my gosh, rasberries, cream, and the fudge like cake. Perfection. That dessert was spot on!  There was one small incident that I wasn't super thrilled with how it was handled. The waiter brought over our steaks and sides. In the few seconds it took me to grab my fork and knife and almost cut into my steak, my husband (and at the same time, the waiter) realized he brought over the wrong steaks. Like, our entire order was for a different table. Literally, not a big deal at all. Misstakes happen. However, without even an apology he grabbed all the plates, including the veggie sides (that come with all restaurant week meals!) and cleared our table. It was just awkward cause he made something that wasnt a big deal into a scene. Our neighbors sitting beside us literally leaned over and said they couldnt believe he did that and took the sides off the table too. Additionally, I would never complain about this, but the new steak I got was definitely not as nice looking or as large of a cut (not that it completely mattered cause I didnt even eat all my steak anyways) as the one that was accidentally served to me. Felt like I got the reject one! However, it was delicious and we just moved on."}
{"text":"Has lunch here and I have to say the service was spot on.  Everyone was friendly and helpful.  The food was great.  The mashed potatoes...  I could eat way more than I should.  They have figured out how to make the taste so good which is surprising because they are so easy to make but most restaurants just can't seem to make them very well.  With the exception of The Capital Grill I can show them how to make them perfect...  Eat here for sure... you will not be disappointed..."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere, the food is always great and consistently good.  Service excellent. We've dined here many times and never have been disappointed."}
{"text":"The Capital Grille in downtown Charlotte is an excellent restaurant with fine service, welcoming people, and great food. Just be ready to pay the piper when you leave!  Ambiance: This place is a fine establishment, which you notice walking in. They greet you warmly, take your coat, and do the right things when you enter.  The restaurant was quite busy, and noisy as well. We were fortunate having a large group, so we were seated in a dining area where we could close a set of doors. This helped tremendously!  Wine choices are plentiful, they did a fine job with mixed drinks and everyone was pleased with the drinks.  Food was also excellent. We had several appetizers and they were all good to excellent. I really enjoyed the Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarella with Vine Ripe Tomatoes. Slightly crispy, and delicious.  For the main, I chose the 10 oz. filet, which came perfectly prepared. The pumpkin cheesecake for dessert was very nice, but a little too sweet I think.  Overall, the meal for our group was excellent. The price for this meal was over our normal expectations, even for Charlotte. It was the only slight disappointment in our group's evening."}
{"text":"We decided to leave The Encore and try a new restaurant and are we glad we did! How is it after all our trips to Vegas we have never eaten at this restaurant? The entire evening was perfect. We had an amazing view and the best waiter we have ever had. We had Frankie for our server. He was engaging but not intrusive. He made great recommendations which we went with. Most of the table had the Delmonico rib eye. We had calamari, asparagus, potatoes. We split three deserts. Everything was great. The steaks were so good we are still talking about it. Thanks for a wonderful experience. We were told they have a location in Beverly Hills which we will try."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for our 24th wedding anniversary and I could go on and on about the food, service & experience but below sums it up. This is one of the best restaurants in the Country and deserves all the accolades it receives. There are no weaknesses and the dining experience is outstanding.  From the crab appetizer to the dry aged bone-in NY Strip to the lobster mac & cheese this place hits high marks across the board. David, our waiter, was a delight and perfectly attentive. Thank you Capital Grille for a memorable experience and outstanding meal. See you again."}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight at Capital Grille. First of all we were almost 40 minutes late for our reservation. We called 15 minutes prior to arrival to inform them and they were very accommodating even though the restaurant was packed when we arrived our table was ready and the service was impeccable.  The bone in ribeye had the perfect marbling which meant the flavor was delicious. I also recommend the au gratin potatoes and please save room for the amazing coconut cream pie."}
{"text":"Outstanding first visit! My server Amy made it special. I had the lobster and crab burger and lobster bisque. The atmosphere was high end. The food and service were exceptional. Can't wait to go back to further explore the menu."}
{"text":"Are you the type of person that requires being seen in an expensive, overly pretentious restaurant so that you can wear it as a status symbol?  Or maybe you're a gansta who dresses like CiLo Green and wants to show the hunny's (yes, a group of them out with one man) a night on the town.  Or maybe you are a group of ladies who can't figure out why the Bravo TV Channel passed Charlotte over for the next cast of Real Housewives?  If you fall into any of these three categories, this is the joint for you.  In all honesty, I have seen all three scenarios mentioned above play out during each of the three times I've been to this restaurant (as for the third scenario, there must have been a Real Housewives convention or something in town...there were no fewer than 5 tables of cougars decked to the 9's trying to impress SOMEone....)  The food is good, not great.  Their steaks are great cuts of meat, but I can get their roasted chicken off the rotisserie at Harris Teeter, and their fish is always dry.  I won't harp on their oysters, as it was out-of-season when I got them, and that's not a fair shake, but still....No Bueno.  Go for the top tier steak...steer clear of apps. and other proteins.  The service, managers, and hostesses here are all as pretentious as the surroundings.  Funny story; my friends got turned away due to the places dress code.  They weren't given that reason, but come on...they walked into an empty restaurant, were given elevator eyes by the hostess, and were told that all the empty tables had \"reservations attached to them\".  And we are not talking bums off the street here...this was a Brooks Brothers and TRCW wearin' couple!  Bottom line...leave the jeans at home for this place...may even want to throw on a jacket to improve your chances with St. Peter at the Pearly Gates...I mean, the hostess at the podium.  Overall, if you feel the need to define your restaurant experience by how much you spend, and the number of \"important\" people sitting next to you, go here.  If you want good food, and don't feel like taking out a second mortgage on your home to enjoy a nice meal, pass on this one.  As far as high-end steakhouses go, might I suggest Ruth's Chris (right down the street) or Del Friscos (South Park) as better alternatives to this place?  Del Frisco's is my personal choice, due to the fact that I always see Ric Flair here, and he entertains me...WOOOOO!"}
{"text":"The food was above average but not as good as it used to be. The atmosphere has gone done hill. I sat in the bar and it seemed like I was in a sports bar instead of an upscale high-end establishment. The bar tender was polite and informative. The people eating at the bar were obnoxious and rude. Most likely will not return. Not like it was 10 years ago classy and upscale."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy.. great wine, great cosmos, great bread, great filet mignon, and even greater dessert. I was skeptical of whether the restaurant could easily accommodate a large group (over 20!), but they did a great job. I'll definitely have to return next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I can not say enough about this wonderful restaurant!  It is always a treat for us and we look forward to dining here.  Anytime we have a special event or want to guarantee that we will enjoy our evening we make plans that include the Capital Grille!  They make you feel special from the moment you walk in and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Great place  Highly recommend. Been there a few times always fantastic service . Pricing is great and servers are terrific"}
{"text":"Excellent service by John Harris, enjoyed the evening and the atmosphere... Great lobster and scallops... Great lamb chops and all details of our evening was just nice  Welcoming floor managers and we were seated instantly on a Friday night honoring the reservation was an important nice quick first impression of our dinner. Thank you."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Great food and they make you feel as though you are the only customer in the place.  We come here for all our birthdays and anniversaries."}
{"text":"This place was good but I've had better steaks! Nice little place. Try it and see what you think."}
{"text":"Service lacking tonight. Maybe an off night."}
{"text":"A big THANK YOU to Capital Grille, Ann (the event coordinator) and the servers who helped us with my brother's dinner rehearsal.  We had 34 guests in the Biltmore Room.  The food was amazing and I can honestly say, I have dealt with many vendors and this event was seamless.  They went above and beyond to make our night special.  I feel horrible that I forgot the head server's name, but he was THE BEST.  Thank you!  I highly recommend this venue if anyone is looking to host a private event.  THANK YOU ANN AND CAPITAL GRILLE!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. We chose to go out to eat here as we had only heard great things about Capital Grille. We will never return to this establishment for a meal again.   Our waiter was very nice and the decor of the restaurant is beautiful as well. For starters I got the mozzarella basil tomato salad. It was pretty good so no complaints there. I chose the special of the night for my entree which was three small steaks prepared in three signature ways. I loved two of them the balsamic one was pretty bad but not inedible. Our water glasses were left empty several times which I thought was weird considering how much a meal like this costs. My husband ordered the porterhouse and he asked for it to be medium. Well it was bordering on the side of well-done and I tasted his and didn't like it at all. He thought it was very dry and it wasn't hot it seemed as though it had been sitting around before they brought it out to us. Honestly the steaks he grills from Teeter have more flavor than this dish. This was obviously very disappointing but we just thought ok not worth the money but we would possibly return for the specialty dishes at a future date.   The main reason I am giving a one star review is because I woke up in the middle of the night with awful stomach pains and have been sick for the past 10 hours. My husband was nauseas but not as sick as me.  We didn't sleep practically at all last night and because of this i would never ever return here. I would recommend grilling steaks on your own grill and not wasting a ton of money to get an underwhelming sickening experience."}
{"text":"Got lost in the \"most confusing mall in america\" while trying to find the entrance; which is tucked behind the food court. Use the valet. Best steak I've had in a long time. Service is great, but A/V didn't work in the small meeting room we reserved. Shirmp cocktail was huge and fresh, dessert platter had cheesecake, chocolate cake and creme brule, awesome! While I didn't pay the bill myself, I know it was pricey."}
{"text":"Last minute decision to grab some chow here but have been here many times before and love the atmosphere as well as the food... For a Darden owned chain they do a pretty darn good job not being a red lobster!   We ordered light and had the Brussell Sprouts w bacon... What's not better with a little bacon? We also had the tenderloin sliders off the bar menu which were amazing... Gorgonzola and fried mushrooms along with great little rolls- amazing! Hungry again just thinking about it"}
{"text":"The Tomahawk ribeye was a sight to behold in it self.  We had a group of 14 large hungry men and every aspect was spot on. From the great and attentive service to the perfect cook on every steak it was fantastic. I will look for a capital grill where ever I travel"}
{"text":"Went for restaurant week in January. We were seated in about 15 mins or so. The ambience is nice. We had the $45 add on with the bone in kona crusted dry age NY strip. Nice size but lacked flavor. Mashed potatoes and green beans were good. The different variety of bread brought to the table was very delicious. Will visit again."}
{"text":"One of my fav spots for dinner, steaks are delicious and a great spot for restaurant week"}
{"text":"Usually come here for special occasions .... My sons favorite place to celebrate his B-day, Their steaks are delish so are their wines, Filet mignon and sam's mashed potatoes and the grilled asparagus never disappoints. Great view of the strip celebrated New Year's Eve here last year and got to see all the fireworks without having to deal with the crowd on the strip."}
{"text":"Average.  Good appetizers. Nice staff. Great views. Decent selection of wine. Loved the mozzarella and tomato salad! My main course was not great very disappointed. It was plain. (I had the herb chicken with mushroom risotto) I love risotto this one had no flavor and was not creamy not even sticky. The chicken was very very plain no flavor."}
{"text":"If you don't like this place, you don't like any place.  If you don't have 300 bucks to spend DO NOT GO.  Food-EXCELLENT.  Service- EXCELLENT drinks-EXCELLENT.  Eating there is like being on a cruise.  It is by far the best resturant in Charlotte, maybe the USA.  I have been there 10 times and will continue to go.  BTW the valet parking is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Ooh La La, Capital Grille is the most Ritzy and detail oriented restaurant in Charlotte, to help you understand what I mean allow me to tell a little story:  It was my Girlfriend's Birthday and I wanted to make a good impression on her, so I decided to take her to Capital grille in Uptown Charlotte.  I called and made reservations, they were very nice and completely accommodating over the phone.  We arrive on time for our reservations and we are greeted by the hostess who is the first to tell my girlfriend Happy Birthday, everyone inn the restaurant from the servers to the bus boys said hello to us and wished my girl a happy birthday.  When we arrived at the table it was covered in a very classy looking glitter and decorations specifically yfor the occasion.  They made us feel like movie stars, and she thought I was amazing because I had set all this up, but really it was all Capital Grille. So right away the service has set the scene for us to have an excellent night.  Then came the food, we started with a round of gin and tonics, good, and a crab cake appetizer which was amazing, chunks of perfectly seasoned crab meat, and just enough to wet our appetites for the main course.  She ordered the fillet Mignon, and I got the porterhouse.  It was spectacular.  The meat is aged in a glassed in room, which you can see when you first walk in, and tastes incredibly rich, with many layers of flavor, from the smoked grilled aspect to the texture of the aged beef, ummm, I even took the bone home and gnawed on it the next day, it was that good.  The mashed potatoes were really good too.  Capital grille is perfect for special occasions, a little pricey, but when you're celebrating, this is the place to go all out."}
{"text":"Love this place. I'd order just the lobster Mac n cheese and be happy, and full. It is not incredibly noisy here, so conversation  isn't hard to have over dinner."}
{"text":"While in Vegas, we had two really good standout meals. One being at The Capital Grille.   Our party of 5 arrived a few minutes early for our 8pm reservation Friday, May 05, 2017. We were quickly escorted to our table where we were immediately greeted by our server. I ordered the filet. My guy ordered the seared tenderloin with butter poached lobster tail. Two others in our group also ordered the seared tenderloin with butter poached lobster tails and another ordered the dry aged NY strip au poivre with courvoisier cream. To share, the lobster mac 'n' cheese.   Excellent steaks. Attentive, personable waitstaff."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to dine here a day before Valentine's Day. Upon arriving, we were asked if we had a reservation. Oops! Thankfully we were able to get a booth before the dinner rush. Our server was Les, who was fabulous! He was extremely pleasant, knowledgeable with the menu, made several food and alcohol recommendations, and always showed up at the right moment. I appreciate servers who are attentive, but not overbearing, and take the initiative. The atmosphere was nice and the food and alcohol were great! I've always wanted to try Capital Grille thanks to Trisha Paytas. (;   Tab breakdown: Large Pellegrino @ $7.50 Dirty Titos Martini @ $14.00 Calamari appetizer @ $19.00 Roasted Swordfish @ $47.00 2 Lobster Mac N' Cheese @ $38.00 Total was $135.85, excluding tip    We left happy and well fed! Saving room for dessert is on the bucket list."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful.  Expensive? Yes.  Worth it?  Yes.  Especially if you are celebrating any special occasion.  Our meal cost close to $200 for two of us with drinks and tip but we were given so many freebies and such great service it was well worth it!  Free appetizer, free glass of wine, free birthday dessert sampler AND two free glasses of champagne!     Plus the food was extraordinary and well worth the price.  The Chilean sea bass was so full of richness and flavor!  The lobster mac and cheese was amazingly tender and my boyfriends steak had not a single piece of fat or gristle.  Everything was lovely and delicious!"}
{"text":"Not a good experience!!  The server staff isn't up to par with what a high end steak place should be. First the server argued with me when I asked about the Kona Steak and stopped him once he said coffee was in the rub. He said you can't taste it and I said I dislike coffee a lot and I probably would and he wanted to argue about it. Second, the staff came and took our plates and appetizer before we were done with it and we had to get up and track him down to get it back. Third, the side and steak came out about 10 mins apart. Fourth, the medium rare I requested came out blood red and cold it was so rare. Fifth the lobster mac had shell pieces from the lobster that I thought cracked a tooth it hurt so bad. Sixth, the server hands the bill to someone other then myself even though my name was on the reservation. All in all this was a VERY BAD experience at one of my favorite steak houses. Worst part about was I was trying to close a deal with clients and the bad service was the topic of conversation instead of my closing."}
{"text":"Excellente  viande griller et vue sur l hôtel encore et Wynn ou nous avons séjourné 4 nuits . C fabuleux le crabe cake !!"}
{"text":"Amazing AMAZING food. Still day dreaming about it. Terri, our server, was phenomenal. He really knew what he was talking about, had tons of recommendations, was attentive, polite, and all around pleasant to be around. Will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Friends of ours made plans to have dinner for our shared wedding anniversary.  The service and the food couldn't be beat!  It was a wonderfully memorable experience and we have pictures (that our waitress happily offered to take) to show for it :)"}
{"text":"I went here for Valentines and it was so worth it! Very classy! The service was amazing! The lobster mac& cheese was to die for. We also ordered the calamari seriously so delish. Def coming back!"}
{"text":"OMG! Expensive but worth every penny! I will remember this place for the rest of my life... Celebrated 10 year wedding anniversary, and first time to Charlotte, NC. Made reservations on-line in advance, and hubby called to arrange special seating for romantic dinner. They exceeded our expectations! Felt like they literally rolled out red carpet for us.. Private booth, table decorated (rose and card), complementary champagne & dessert, waiter Alex was top notch! We felt like stars.. Food was delicious. We both had the special of the night, recommended by our waiter. I had the Cod and Risotto, hubby had Filet Mignon (cut like butter). He only wished his came with a side, but I had plenty risotto to share with him. Want to go back already!"}
{"text":"It was my second time dining at Capital Grille and I'm Sure there will be a third eventually. The prices are a tad bit more affordable compared to the fancy steak houses in and around LV. The service is top notch and every waiter is so personable and funny. They are honest about what food and drink they think would be best suited for you.. which can take some pressure of you.  The Gorgonzola NY strip is great... but the kona crusted NY strip I ate earlier in the year from there was a hair better I thought. My wife's bone in filet was a juicy piece of meat n melted in your mouth, but watch out for the steep price. The sautéed mushrooms were great as a side. You can't go wrong with mushrooms doused in butter.  I love the fact they knew it was my birthday and left me a card from the staff and a free dessert at meals end. Very nice touch!  Take advantage of their unlimited wine pours for $28. It's only around for the summer and they use 10 highly rated wines. Not $5 wines you can buy at cvs. You can definitely take advantage but I'm sure you'll be a drunkard by the end of the meal.  Capital grille is a top notch establishment and you should give it a try!"}
{"text":"We went to the Capital Grille for a pre-penguins game meal with family friends.  I was stunned by the prices.  The high end experience was a change of pace to my normal pre game meal, but It's difficult to really find a way to enjoy your meal when you know the costs are so exorbitant.  The food, however, tasted fantastic and if you have the money available it is a fantastic option for higher-end dining in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Average. Personally not worth the price. The food is nothing to write home about but the drinks Bradley poured were fantastic.   Bradley was very nice and polite. We sat at his bar at 5pm as they opened and he gave us his undecided attention. Thanks again Bradley."}
{"text":"This steakhouse is at the top of my list!  Very nice ambiance (we were seated by the window so we had a nice view of the strip).  Service is impeccable and food is delicious.  You absolutely have to try the Delmonico steak.  It's huge so I suggest sharing.  Sides were tasty and big enough for sharing as well.  I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We went to The Capital Grille last week for the first time. First thing I noticed was the average age of the customers., which I would say was about 70. Nothing wrong with that.  My boyfriend ordered the filet, which was the best we've ever eaten. Like butter. I had the bone in sirloin which was okay. The green beans and makes potatoes were average at best.   Or waiter Ken was a bit pretentious which was a strange and off putting. Personality aside, the service was definitely lacking.  Bottom line, we'll never go back. If I want to drop $200 on a meal, I'll go to the Salt Cellar or the Rolerij."}
{"text":"Took my step-mom and nephew for birthday/vegas visit trip.  Everything was awesome.  Stephanie McCool is an exceptional server!  Defiantly ask for her she is awesome.  Steaks melt in your mouth and everything is tasty.  Great place for steak!"}
{"text":"I had such a great experience here!! When my date made the reservation he said we were celebrating my birthday. They had fully decorated the table with confetti and glitter and gave me a birthday card. The service all night was phenomenal as was the food. Then a birthday dessert was brought as another surprise. I loved it all. They really know how to treat the birthday girl."}
{"text":"Several visits ..All aspects top rate..Wine, appetizers,sides ..Steak tooo salty on most occasions..One so salty almost unable to eat, but took home to save in stew but still so salty just threw out ..Will avoid steak here as Lobster etc good.."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful meal and service at this restaurant. Our server, Jill Giles, showed a genuine interest in our enjoyment, was very kind and personable, and ensured that what we ordered would be to our enjoyment. We ordered the Ribeye Sandwich and the 8 ounce filet. Both of these came out hot and fresh, and one again Jill made sure we were more than pleasantly satisfied with what we had ordered. Javier and Saul, our server assistants were very kind and pleasantly assisted us with anything we asked.  Thank you Capital Grille for an excellent dining experience!"}
{"text":"the food was excellent and both the host and waitress were excellent. most steakhouses like mccormick and schmidt or ruth's chris are pricy and have smaller portions. despite the hefty price, capital grille is the only steakhouse that actually serves you a large enough portion that you feel satisfied. it was definitely worth the price tag. not something i'd do every month but certainly for special occasions."}
{"text":"As correctly predicted by my last review, I ordered the Lobster and Crab sandwich(think lightly fried crab cake with lobster) along with a bowl of the Clam Chowder.  Each dish stands on it's own.  The Clam Chowder was hot, tasty, fragrant, and not overdone --- Clams cooked as they should be, and perfect for the cold weather we've had recently.  The lobster and crab cake sandwich was a nice size, served on a toasted bun, with greens, and was lightly fried as mentioned.  I think mine could have been fried longer, and perhaps could have stuck together a little better --- but overall it was excellent.  Part of the issue was the larger pieces of lobster, and it's hard to complain about that!  This was an expensive but tasty extravagance for lunch. The capital grille gets it right again!  P.S. I think I'm worth it. :)"}
{"text":"Gorgonzola Filet was phenomenal & my Dad enjoyed his turkey dinner last night! Terry was our server and he was great! Definitely asking for him next time we go!!"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Capital Grille, but my recent experience was a huge disappointment. I ordered a filet medium rare, which came out super dry, with almost no flavor at all. I asked for grilled onions with my steak, and received what looked like a dried out, halved onion that had been on the flat top for a few seconds. The spinach was not evenly cooked (some came out looking like spinach salad, and some parts were wilted), and was not flavorful. My husband's scallops were also dry and overcooked. The lobster macaroni was pretty good, but overall, the food was exceedingly sub-par from what I have come to expect from Capital Grille, and what their prices are. It was the kind of meal I would expect from Applebees. Del Frisco's is a much better fine dining experience in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Wow.  The absolute best burger in the world... and I've had many.  I've been to all those burger specialty places, places that have $20 burgers, etc.  There is no burger better than this one.  (only available by special request for dinner though - come for lunch to have it otherwise).  Their steaks are great too.  Classy place and not cheap, but an amazing view of the strip on the 3rd floor of Fashion Show Mall across from the Wynn.    If you want to impress your girl, bring her here..."}
{"text":"What a great evening. We came here after seeing \"O.\"  Amazing food and incredible service. Kristen gave us amazing service as did Jeff. Thanks to both of you for an amazing evening!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Capital Grille!!!! My husband & I sat at the bar tonight to celebrate. Our bartender Alex was amazing! Wagyu and Wine feature was great, but it was really Alex who made the night special. The Capital Grille staff always delivers :)"}
{"text":"The best food I've eaten in my entire life. I came from Indiana and may never eat here again, but I will never forget the delicious, perfectly crafted food I enjoyed here. I made sure to try a bite of every dish ordered by my family. The variety of incredible flavor I observed, proved irrefutably to me, that whatever you order here, will be the highest quality food you've ever had.  The lobster was flawless. Perfectly cooked and juicy. None of it was dry. The steaks were indescribably incredible. You have to order it one level more cooked than you actually want it though. Medium =  medium rare, medium rare = rare, rare = raw, etc. no matter how you order it though, the outside will be charred beautifully, and flavor will burst from every bite."}
{"text":"I had the fried lobster tail couple weeks ago now they dnt hve it please get that bk on menu"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that you have to ask for Coco at this location.  Coco (how can you forget that name?) was the difference between a good experience and a great one!  She knew the wines, the menu, timing etc.  The food was delicious (ribeye, creamed spinach, au gratin) was all done perfectly and served hot even though it was a late dinner you would have thought it was earlier with the energy level.  It was worth the time and money and I am going back even though I am an out-of-towner!!"}
{"text":"Ok so we went here to celebrate our 35th anniversary.  They gave us a seat by the windows - what an awesome view!  The food was great.  Alex, our server gave us wonderful recommendations on both food and wine.  I had a bone In rib eye special, hubby had a lobster tail and we were both In Heaven!  The wedge salad was great, as was the Brussels sprouts side dish.  They comped us a wonderful dessert, chocolate mousse and a light cheesecake brûlée.  It was a fabulous dinner and venue.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wen't to Capital Grille for my birthday dinner. I hadn't been here since I was in High School. From what I remembered it was really good. Of course everything is a la carte. I ended up only having Lobster Mac and Cheese. (I'd already had a recovery meal after party #1) It was okay. Could have used a boost in flavor somewhere. Maybe some salt. My biggest concern was my drink. Is that bad? I'm concerned with my drink. Anyway, I ordered a Sidecar. It came in a goblet style glass full of ice. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong. Are Sidecars not to be served up? With actual Cognac? I figured Capital would know better than that. Other than that my large group was served well. They even threw some berries on a platter with my cake that my friends brought. Nice touch. Oh, and we saw celebrities, like face to face. Thank goodness CIAA will be back for six more years!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, however small salad portions.  I ordered the basil tomato salad it was ok but very small.  The calamari was great a better portion and was not over cooked.  I had a glass of wine that was recommended by the server good but not great.     The reason for the 2 star loss is that the service was just so so.  My sister had to wait a long time to get her wine and the server did not explain the chef's specials, we had to ask him.  Slow service and it was not a full house.  Waters ran empty and trying to get him to come by more than twice was hard.  We had another server who was not in our section that did a better job.  I would go here again just hope to get a good server with more wine knowledge."}
{"text":"Oh wow. It really doesn't get any better than this. I have been to CG a couple times before, but this last meal was really spectacular - and thank goodness because we were celebrating my sister's birthday. We took part in the \"Generous Pour\" that was $27 to try 7 different wines. You could try all whites, all reds, a mixture, or every single one of them if you wanted to. It was a great deal and the wines were spectacular and all very unique.  We tried the lobster mac and cheese with all of our steaks. We had someone order the filet mignon, someone order a strip steak and someone else the coffee encrusted bone-in steak and they were all top notch.   Our waiter, Francisco Barrajas, was exceptional and added to our incredible experience. Although we did not order an appetizer, he brought one out to us because our meal was \"taking longer than expected.\" We were not worried, as we were enjoying ourselves, the view and the fabulous wines. Of course the three different steaks we ordered were amazing and Francisco continued to make us feel like we were the only ones in the restaurant.   Also, we were too full for dessert but Francisco still brought out a creme brulee. WE'RE NOT WORTHY. Clearly that was delicious, too.  Exceptional all around and really a fun dining experience."}
{"text":"Service was excellent and my steak was made to perfection. Ambiance is great for dinner date or even business dinner with colleagues. The side dishes were just okay. The creamy spinach as bit on the salty side.  I wasn't impressed though with the tablet menu. My OCD was kicking in seeing the different finger smears on the screen."}
{"text":"Great lunch today. And Gio rocked it as server. Friendly and suggestive."}
{"text":"Had a great meal and our server was excellent. If I have to compare to other comparable steakhouses(Mastro's or Joe's Prime) I have to go 4 stars. Still excellent but not, at least my opinion, on the level with those two."}
{"text":"Dined at Capital Grille last night . We made an 8pm reservation and was seated in 5 min . Had a window seat of the strip , a beautiful view of it all . Only the attractiveness of my date could keep me from starring out the window . My Waiter , Michael Morris was incredible to us , attentive enough but not overbearing as some can be , which allowed us to enjoy our meal and each others company  My appreciation of Michael was reflected in his tip . My next visit , Michael I will ask to be Seated in your area .  Thank you again   The food presentation from the appetizers to the entrees were amazing and quite tasty all around , from my lobster tails and vegetables to her filet mignon with crab meat .  Why not 5 stars for this well deserving establishment ? Would be nice to see the days when people would dress well to go out and Not just the ladies . For what you you will pay to dine here , you owe it to your wive's and girlfriends to step it up in the dress dept . Im sure they will truly appreciate you for it .   There is an easy access elevator to the restaurant from the valet area for added convince ."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the Capital Grille. I just visited for my first time and had a great experience.  The service was top notch. The waiter was very helpful and always there whenever we needed anything. A manager even came by to check on us a couple of times. The valet recognized us and got our car quick when it was time to go. I can not recall the last time I had such excellent service.  We ordered a lot of food and shared with each other and I have to say that everything I tried was really good. I am usually not a steak person, but the steak here was probably the best steak I have ever had.  The only thing I really didn't like was that this restaurant was so expensive, but you get what you pay for, so I am sure that their prices were fair and reasonable, because both the food and service were outstanding."}
{"text":"had to drop a star because the server wasn't a good as the last time we were in had to ask for refills he didn't just do it he only can back around when he brought the food now the food was awesome I had the mushroom crusted steak that was grate wife had lamb chop the jelly that they served was the best that I ever had I think it was fig the salmon was good as well get the apple cobbler it was amazing"}
{"text":"**Review for Catering Services** I have been to many cocktail parties where Capital Grill has catered the food, most recently last night at the Scottsdale Mercedes dealership.  The servers are always incredibly professional and friendly. The food...oh the food. It is amazing! They do passed Hors d'oeuvres like no ones business! Some of my favorites include the lobster/crab cakes, lobster fritters, mushroom crostini and chocolate espresso tarts. If you need catering for a classy event THIS IS THE PLACE TO USE!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but it was excellent.  I had an extremely succulent order of crab legs with butter.  They were outstanding.  I also shared some of the best mashed potatoes I've ever had in my life!  I pondered dinging them a star on price, but you get what you pay for.  Know going into this place that it's an expensive steakhouse.  Disclaimer: I wasn't the one paying for the meal when I dined here.  The lighting was dim, and I could see this place being very romantic for special occasions.  If you plan to stay more than the two hour limit in the pay parking, just park in the free lot or garage behind Saks and Macy's.  Or just valet it if paying a little doesn't matter to you."}
{"text":"I guess I expected more from here...maybe because it's restaurant week the service was a little sub par. Our server Jessica started off with introducing the iPad and left. It had the drink selection on there. She gave our group restaurant week menus without asking us if that was the reason for our visit. She was able to answer questions we had.   Ordered the stoli doli. Pineapple infused vodka. I thought It was weak. Not just on alcohol but pineapple taste too. I've had this drink before at other places and it tasted better.  Salad was no problem.   Steak...we all paid for an upgrade to our steak.  I asked for medium to medium well. I received almost well and it was kind of dry. My friend wanted that and hers was cooked less so we switched. We made Jessica aware. She asked me if I wanted another one but it will be awhile. I knew they would be closing soon so I declined. As I got closer to the bone the steak was more rare. I stopped eating it. I showed Jessica and my bf took it to eat it. She said nothing about my complaint. My bf did get a nice dessert plate for his birthday. Overall it was an ok experience. Not sure if I will return."}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday celebration. I had the filet oscar style with the crab and asparagus. We also had sides of lobster mac and asparagus. I thought that the filet was tender and delicious. The oscar style tasted a bit sweet, I think I would have liked it to be more savory. The asparagus was normally-sized, at some restaurants I have had large asparagus. The lobster mac was delicious with big pieces of lobster and a crunchy topping. Their birthday decorations were cute. The dessert was coffee chocolate cake and a cheesecake. People who like coffee chocolate would like this cake, it was a bit like a flourless cake. People who like cheesecake would also like the cheesecake. The whipped cream tasted non-fat with low sugar. I liked how they put \"happy birthday\" on the plate, took a picture of us, and gave us a copy of the photo."}
{"text":"Very nice diner, the meat was excellent and the service exceptional. Alex made our diner the best experience."}
{"text":"I have been to Captial Grille quite a few times. This time we went for my brother's birthday. I was disappointed when he chose Capital Grille over City Hall, but whatever.  First, I will say that hostesses are very friendly. I do like when you go for a birthday they decorate the table and give the birthday person a nice card. For what it is worth, it is a nice addition.  My complaint is more with the waiter. The waiter comes over and the first thing he asked is what can he get us to drink. Well, no one wanted any alcohol, so we order pellegrino and diet coke. Well that was enough for the waiter to change his attitude and start being rude. I have noticed this is a regular response by waiters at more expensive restaurants. It is like what the heck do they care.  Next, the people were with are not big fish or shell fish eaters, so none of the appetizers were going to work for the table, which is fine because we are there for the steak.  We order salads and our steaks. Well maybe times have changed, but the salads were small. I swear they use to be big enough to share, not anymore.   When we went to order the sides, again the waiter gave me a WTF look. They have lobster mac and cheese. Last time we were at Capitol Grille, they very happily served the lobster on the side. Well this time, again there were people in the party that wanted mac and cheese but not fans of lobster, so I ask to have it seperated. He was liked appalled that I would ask such a thing. Again what does it matter to him.  Everyone enjoyed their steaks. Good quality, but I believe a little over priced.  Also, I just have to say what RECESSION?? THis place was packed and at $45 a pop for a steak, come on!"}
{"text":"Over hyped and over priced.  One expects to pay through the nose, but one expects much better food.  The steak is excellent, but the lobster -- both as a lobster bisque and as a salad -- leaves much to be desired.  The bisque was way too floury; the salad was tasteless.  We doubt we'll return."}
{"text":"Came here for an anniversary dinner and had a wonderful experience thanks to our waitress Nicole. We both had the filet which was absolutely delicious. Only (very minor) gripe was my medium filet seem closer to medium well. Lobster Mac n cheese was great too. This is the second time at a Capital Grille and to me, their steak is the best when compared to others like Maestro's and Ruth's Chris."}
{"text":"Just went here for a friend's Bachelor party and we had the private room along w/ our favorite waiter, ALEX.  I highly recommend all the appetizers, soups, and any steak in the Chef Selection area. You cannot go wrong. Don't forget about the Stoli Doli!  I'm also not a huge dessert, but make sure you get the Coconut cream pie, even if you do not like coconut!  Thank you Capital Grill, especially Alex, for years and years of stellar service.  This place is a great value for the food and service, compared to other possibilities in vegas."}
{"text":"For some strange reason, my mom wanted steak for her birthday dinner, and the good kind, not the kind I can get at Taco Bell for $2.99.   So off to The Capital Grille we went.   And we weren't disappointed... by the food at least. The food was blissful. From the perfectly cooked filet mignons, to the incredibly fresh shrimp cocktail, to the creamy and utterly delicious mashed potatoes with the right amount of lumpiness... it was 5* worthy.   However, the service did disappoint. Our server, an older gent who still had spring in his step, was kept so busy by his other tables at different corners of the restaurant, left us neglected for more than 25 minutes between service of the appetizers and checking in to see if we had finished. We had, and we'd finished our waters and sodas as well.   To the chefs at The Capital Grille... well done! To the waitstaff... sigh... just... sigh."}
{"text":"We went for an early dinner, 3pm, and the restaurant was not busy. Our wait staff was professional and courteous, but the food was nothing to brag about and hardly worth the $300 tab (no wine or alcohol). There were five in our party and three of our steaks were not done as we asked. Mine was cooked to the right color (pink center) but it was not hot! I mean, this is a steakhouse, you should NEVER have to send your steak back... The grilled asparagus was excellent as were the garlic mashed potatoes. But that is not what you go to a steakhouse for. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Now until November 19th, in the lounge area & for only $25, you can enjoy a beautiful glass of Caymus, Emmolo or Belle Glos, plus a huge WAGYU Burger!  What a remarkable way to end the last event, 'The Generous Pour' by starting this one 'Wine & Wagyu.'  Along with the fantastic bartender, Michael Giambrone & manager Jason Slaughter, you truly cannot ask for a better team to enjoy the view, perfectly made signature drinks & mouthwatering food.  Kudos to the chefs as well cause every time is better than the last.    I always take Giambrone's food recommendations & never regret them!  A friend of mine & I both tried The Grille's Waygu Cheeseburger which had Havarti, Fried Egg & Crispy Onions on top.  Cutting into it w/ the yolk oozing all over the burger was a perfect burger to start w/.  The other two burgers & wine look delicious also!  Now, I'll have to come back for them & will try the Emmolo next time.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Ok, I told you all that we were on a celebration romp through Charlotte and it ended at The Capital Grille. The hubs out did himself this time :-)   Let me begin by thanking our server Alissa, who was cordial, attentive, and upbeat the entire night. It was our first time at Capital Grille and I was so impressed with the ambiance of the restuarant. It looked like there were enough \"suits\" in the place to write a check to clear the federal deficit, but I liked that. The decor had an old world feel blended with a wall street vigor. The hostess was gracious and we were seated immediately and noticed the restaurant was quite busy for a Wednesday night.   Alissa explained the chef features for the night and we agreed to try it. We received complimentary champagne and I ordered the smoked salmon as an appetizer. It was a good portion and was served with aioli, capers, chopped onions, and crisp pita triangles. I enjoyed it immensely as smoked salmon is one of my favorites. The hubs ordered a salad, and we ordered the lobster mac-n-cheese and truffle fries for our son, the Gabe-meister (I kept theifing the lobster out of the mac-n-cheese it was soooo good) and the truffle fries were amazing, it had this parmasen flavor to it. I do not eat red meat regularly but wanted to try the feature 4 oz filet medallion at medium with a fennel based sauce. The hubs opted for the 12 oz. filet mignon at medium rare with crab (out of the shell) in butter sauce. Needless to say we enjoyed the meal and left completely satisfied and impressed with Capital Grille. The food was great but it was the service that really impressed, two managers came by and wished me a happy birthday and checked on us to see if everything was ok. VERY NICE TOUCH! :-)  For dessert, we brought our favorite cheesecake creme  iced cake from Harris Teeter, and yes the restaurant was fine with it. We shared cake with Alissa and she enjoyed it as well.  All-in-all, the Capital Grille has managed to produce quality, flavourful food and white glove service as a chain restaurant. We're requesting Alissa next time we visit :-)"}
{"text":"I want to give this place five stars, I really, really do. But I can't. I should preface this entire review by saying that the food absolutely gets 5 stars. One of the best meals Bobby and I have had in PGH to date.  Fortunately, they have valet service but unfortunately because of construction going on downtown it's a little confusing. You have to drive past the Capital Grille and the valet is on your right. When we were here last week, there seemed to be some sort of event going on so valet service took foreeeever to get our car back for us. We've been to this location a few times and every time, despite having reservations, we end up waiting in the lobby for a good 15 minutes. This is okay, and worth it for the food, but they definitely don't get you in right away, or at least not in our experience.  Surprisingly, between the wait to get in and the amount of time our server took between ordering/retrieving our drinks, we didn't even order dinner until 9:00pm. This was sort of frustrating, considering our 8:15 reservations. I don't mind slowly enjoying a nice meal and I can dig the European trend of doing so, but at least let us put the order in and bring us some bread and our starters!  On to the meal itself:  I started with the butternut squash soup and it was amazing! Seriously one of the best (if not the best) butternut squash soup I've had, and I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to squash. Absolutely delicious and the perfect way to start a meal after coming in off the cold street.  For my entree, I had the filet with some sort of gorgonzola crust and I-kid-you-not it was one of the best cuts of steak I've ever eaten. The preparation was absolutely fantastic. It was a perfect medium rare. The flavors of the gorgonzola crust and the small bit of sauce complimented the steak without overwhelming it. I cannot say enough how delicious this meal was!  Pro tip: order the lobster mac n' cheese side. So, so, so good.  At the end of the meal, we waited for awhile for our plates to be cleared. Service was just very slow that night. We noticed that our server had a very large party, so that probably contributed to the slower service. Every other time I've been to the Capital Grille, they have wiped down the tablecloths with the crumb catchers, and offered hot towel service. These amenities were not offered this time. Perhaps because our server was so busy? Or maybe the Capital Grille simply isn't doing this anymore? Not a big deal either way, but I noticed it and so I figured it was worth mentioning.  Our server brought out dessert for us, since it was Bobby's birthday. This was lovely, but we also ordered an additional dessert (the one he really wanted!) but unfortunately, it never came out. Our server was very friendly and apologetic and certainly rectified this on the receipt, but we were just overall a bit underwhelmed with our service this time around. For such a upscale place, we hold this establishment to a higher standard.  Fortunately, the food was so delicious (as always) that I'm only deducting one star for service. It is my sincere hope that this was simply a deviation from the norm in the service here. I know we've certainly experienced better at this location! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So, you may be wondering why vegetarians would go to a steakhouse. One word: Mike. My husband and I love this Capital Grille! Mike K. Is the best server ever. He is consistent, attentive, and provides great recommendations. The menu doesn't change frequently, but when you cater to a mostly stuffy, old-man type of crowd, change isn't usually easily accepted!   They have an excellent vegetarian pasta dish that is reasonably priced, several lovely, fresh salads, and yummy side items.  Your meal will cost you! But, it's worth it! Check out the menu online first to make sure you can find something you'll enjoy at a price you don't mind paying!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  Beautiful location overlooking the Strip.  it is a little weird to get to, on the 3rd floor of an otherwise 2-story mall.  Steak was tasty.  Reservation system on Yelp was VERY useful."}
{"text":"Had a great time, the appetizers were great \"I love the calamari with hot peppers!\"  The sides were so so but the steaks were great!  Service was top notch until the end, had reservation for 7 pm and sat us early.  But, seemed like they wanted to get us out, after dinner they did not ask if we wanted coffee or dessert and just handed the bill and seemed disappointed when we asked for coffee and after dinner drinks."}
{"text":"It's a new place, so maybe they are still getting their bearings, but still, the experience was somewhat disappointing. The food is good, but not stellar. I tried the lamb and fish, and both were well cooked, but overly salted.  The lobster bisque is very good, and their French onion soup is a good interpretation of the classic. Drinks are superb. Finally, the service was somewhat slow. At such an establishment you shouldn't have to wait for 10-15 minutes to get your entrees, especially if the place is half empty. Overall, a below expectations experience. Maybe they'll do better with time..."}
{"text":"First time there. Was very good. Similar to Morton's and Hyde Park. Everyone was very friendly and attended to our needs. Reservations are encouraged. Recommend the Kona filet. Fresh bread served. Recommend paying for valet parking for the convenience."}
{"text":"Scottsdale.  A place where I would love to raise kids a few years down the line.  The location is great.  Plenty of parking places.  Not sure why anyone would valet here unless you want to burn some cash.  The filet mignon was cooked exactly the way I wanted it.  The downside of this location is the service.  We had two waiters for our table, and took them forever to get our drinks, take our orders, clean our table, etc.    Side recommendation:  Mac and Cheese w/ Lobster =D"}
{"text":"Let's just start by saying that I rarely eat at chain restaurants. So the fact that I ended up at Capital Grille for Valentine's day is actually a little embarrassing. But the combination of a $100 gift card that was about to expire, a fond memory of steak tar tar and homemade potato chips at their bar, and a failure to make any other sort of reservation landed us there at about 8pm on Sunday night. I really wasn't feeling like anything fancy, so we decided to sit at the bar, nosh, and watch the Olympics.  First, cocktails. Mine: an expertly made Manhattan that was approximately the size of my head (hurray for oversized martini glasses!) My husbands: Hendricks, rocks, cucumber. Our bartender offered to go get cucumber slices from the kitchen as it was a garnish they typically had at the bar. Score 1 for Kevin the bartender.   Next, food order. This had the potential to be the low point of the evening when they informed me they no longer had the steak tar tar on the menu. Or the ketlle chips. I now wanted to cry. We settled for a caprese salad, beef carpaccio, and the lobster crab cakes. Salad came out promptly, was very tasty and nice presentation. And then...nothing. The other apps lagged for like 15 minutes and the bartender was visibly irritated at the kitchen and wait staff. Luckily I had a full drink in front of me and it was the skating pairs short program on TV so I really wasn't complaining. When the food did show up it was actually worth the wait. Nothing I would have changed about it at all.  For the dessert portion of the evening we decided to try a Colheita port, which the bartender described as a single vintage tawny port. My husband loves tawny port and they had one that was fairly reasonable but still in the Colheita category. Rounded it out with the flourless chocolate espresso cake. Sadly, we were informed they no longer carried our port selection. And then, not so sadly, they poured us a much more expensive version for the price of the other one! Oh, and the dessert itself - freaking amazing. Best chocolate torte I've had in a while.   The actual shocker of the evening was that they took the appetizers off the bill without us saying anything about it. This really wasn't necessary but I think it shows that this place really does have class and that they wanted us to know that wasn't up to their standard of service. Well played.  Oh, and, right before we left the bartender leaned over and said \"Come back on a day when it isn't a holiday and we'll get the kitchen to make you some steak tar tar.  They do it for me all the time.\" Bless you, sweet bartender man. And thank you for a lovely Valentine's day."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food, and great service. What more can you ask for? My husband and I went for our anniversary and we had an amazing time from start to finish. The drinks at the bar were delicious along with the bar nuts. Most people cringe at the thought of bar nuts but these are like a brittle with a small spice to them.    We then go to our table that is decorated with real rose petals and heart confetti.  For our appetizer we order the Shellfish platter which included one whole lobster which was separated for easy eating. Also there were six oysters and six shrimp. All of which were delicious.  My husband had the Sliced Filet Mignon, and I had the Gorgonzola and Truffle Crusted Dry Aged NY Strip.  We both asked for our meat to be cooked medium rare and they both came out textbook.  Both dishes were mouth watering and absolutely spectacular.  For desert we had a special anniversary plate made up for us, and was first asked if there was anything we didn't care for to which I responded coconut.  The waiter came out with a stunning plate with a chocolate espresso type cake and a to die for cheesecake that was so light, not heavy like most cheesecakes are. Also we got the Creme Brûlée, my favorite, which was absolutely heaven.   Everything on their menu looked amazing and I wanted to try all of it. I look foreword to our next visit."}
{"text":"This place here is totally awesome. It has low lights and jazz music playing in the background, hostesses,  waitresses and servers. The food came out hot and full of flavor. I had the lamb chops, soy brussel sprouts w/bacon, lobster mac n cheese and au gratin potatoes everything was delicious. Do bring your big check book, this place isn't for the faint at heart financially.  Do give it a try you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Very rarely do I find a restaurant that brings ALL the elements together: atmosphere, view, service, food, beverage, and more. This restaurant does just that.  I personally ordered a steak with melted gorgonzola cheese with a Cabernet Sauvignon reduction that was simply out-of-this-world. Their salads are incredible. Their bread \"basket\" is amazing. The view and atmosphere are unequalled, perhaps a direct competitor to Charlie Palmers at the 4-Seasons, but Palmer's has no view. Capital Grille overlooks the Las Vegas Blvd (strip). Cocktails prepared correctly, their wine suggestions turned out to be fabulous. The waiter did NOT bust into conversations, he patiently waited his turn to speak. First class. I just reviewed \"Giada\". What a night-and-day difference between the two restaurants. I highly recommend Capital Grille."}
{"text":"Two dozen oysters and a cup of lobster bisque. The lobster got in the way of the bisque . Impeccable service. Our waiter was great . He has his own business card.  Valet parking which is so efficient since parking is limited. Highly recommend. Now to visit my 800 other bookmarks and counting."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a must when in Las Vegas.  The food is delicious, the staff is courteous and the views are gorgeous.  Our server was fantastic.  Frankie Storione was funny, informative, made a point to remember my name. He made sure we were well taken care of, even gave us some extra potatoes- they're delicious !   I would have to recommend you ask to sit in his section. You will not regret it.   We ordered the filet mignon with the soy glazed Brussels sprouts and mashed potatoes.  If you're not a fan of Brussels sprouts- you will after trying these."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect, the drinks, the steak and the service. Was ever so glad to have chosen The Capital Grille for a special dinner. Every member of the staff was terrific, especially our waitress Jenn. She went way past the norm and made our night wonderful."}
{"text":"I brought a party of 11 there for a business dinner.  Waitress  was great, offered great choices and did not push extras. We had plenty to eat and everyone left happy as all Entrees were served as requested in  an attractive fashion .  I strongly recommend Capitol Grill ."}
{"text":"What a Capital Grille! This was quite a disappointing steakhouse to say the least - we had an awful seafood tower - the crab was dry and tasteless, and the other seafood was far from fresh. The waiter dropped calamari on my lap and didn't seem to care. My bone in ribeye was decent, but it didn't make up for everything else. At this price point this Capital Grille needs to clean up their act."}
{"text":"Went here for Easter brunch.  Thankfully someone knew that they do brunch for holidays since they do not show it on their website.  The brunch was spectacular!  Shrimp, crab, raw oysters, carving station with cuts of meat so tender no knife was needed.  The dessert choices kept kids and adults quite happy.  Some in our party took advantage of the personalized omlettes and loved them.  No one had room for the lobster eggs Benedict. Absolutely going back again."}
{"text":"We had dinner here during our 09' management retreat.  It was my first time at CG and I was definitely impressed with the quality of their food and customer service.    I had the Seared Tenderloin with Butter Poached Lobster, which was amazing.  We shared the cold shellfish platter for appetizer which was another great choice.  The oysters were really fresh.    I'm thinking of taking my boyfriend to the LV location over V-day weekend this year.  Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Always a favorite of mine. Usually go to Costa Mesa location but while in Vegas went to this one. Carlos was an amazing server definitely request him. Bone-in ribeye was cooked to perfection. FYI the cheesecake at capital grill is one of the best I've ever had. Thank you Carlos and capital grill."}
{"text":"I celebrated my birthday at Capital Grille, the Biltmore location.  Prior to my birthday dinner I've been to Capital Grille quite a few times in Washington, DC for business meetings and dinners, but never for a celebration.  Initially when my then - boyfriend said we were going to Capital Grille for my birthday dinner I kind of thought, \"Oh great -_-\" but smiled anyway.  When I arrived and sat down at my table I was soooooo happy.  My face lit up!  The menu was personalized to say, \"Happy Birthday Erica, Enjoy!\"  The table was lit with candles and a nice bottle of red wine was sitting there waiting on me.  I love when I have a reservation and the waitress calls me by name.  I really like that!  So immediately upon sitting down, the waitress greeted us, introduced herself and asked me if I wanted to start with any appetizers ... by Name.  We started with oysters on the half shell because no matter where I am, or what state I'm in I absolutely have to have oysters on the half shell if they're on the menu and a cup of clam chowder.  Delicious!  Absolutely no complaints there.  I'm not a huge, huge steak eater so we shared a steak dinner.  We ordered and shared the Gorgonzola and Truffle Dry Aged NY Strip with Cabernet Reduction, cooked Medium.  It was PERFECT!  Totally cooked to perfection.  I don't remember how many ounces the steak was but when we ordered it and asked to split it, the chef was kind enough to split it in the kitchen and served the steak on 2 plates.  It was huge!  I can't imagine eating that steak alone.  The Gorgonzola and Cabernet Reduction complimented the steak so much.  It was mouthwatering! For sides we shared the creamed spinach and Sam's Potatoes.  The creamed spinach was tasty, but the Sam's potatoes were out of this world good.  Get them with your steak ... you won't be disappointed.   Immediately upon wrapping up dinner our waitress and about 3 other servers came out of the kitchen with the most beautiful dessert plate that read ... Happy Birthday Erica, written beautifully in Raspberry sauce ... Yes ... I dipped my finger into that too!  I would highly recommend Capital Grille for business lunches and meetings, date night, a solo dinner or a celebratory dinner of some sort.  They pay so much attention to your requests ... It was a lovely dinner and I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Updating my review just to say how much I really do enjoy this establishment every time I come. I would recommend Michael 100x, he seriously is the best and never fails to make our experience perfect. Everyone else is so lovely as well but Michael really does go above and beyond. Another successful anniversary dinner thanks to Capital Grille, we vowed to do it more often because of how much we love it here."}
{"text":"This event was beyond amazing. It was such a fab event that I am so lucky it was my first Yelp event ever. The Capital Grille is a beautiful venue with really friendly staff and food that is TO. DIE. FOR. Tenderloin Sliders, I'm talking to you. The lobster rolls, shrimp and coconut cream pie don't hurt one bit either. Everything we taste-tested was delicious and we are already talking about heading out there for lunch/dinner again soon.  PS: Treat yourself to the raspberry champagne. You'll thank me later.   The event itself was effortlessly cool and a pleasant place to meet new Yelp friends. Thank you Lindsay and The Capital Grille for such an awesome event!"}
{"text":"The good: The dark bread and huge butter pat were great as was the spinach.   The bad: When they said the kona crusted sirloin was well marbled I thought they meant with fat, not gristle and silver skin. Mostly inedible. However they were super responsive and offered a new steak!  Great management."}
{"text":"Great Service, but just above average food.    We had a large group of 14 and service was perfect.  Quick drink orders, refills, food delivery and over the top attention.  Food was nothing special for the price.  I have been to many steak houses of the same level and there was no comparison in food.  I ordered the Kona Sirloin.  Tasted good, but the cut was not cooked to order (med rare) and tough.  I found out later that I was not the only person that was disappointed with their meal.  Sides were good, but no different than a mid-tier restaurant at half the price.  Drinks were ok.  For a high-end steak house I would have expected a better, more rare bourbon list.  Wine was interesting and good.    If I was with a smaller group I would have sent the steak back, but timing was an issue.  Would recommend trying another steak house."}
{"text":"Just Phenomenal. Everything. Ask for Rebecca, she's delight and has great taste!"}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our 2 year wedding anniversary here on a Friday night.  The interior is elegant and classy and the service is outstanding.  I got the stoli solo cocktail and my husband got the in fashion. Mine was delicious and my husband said his was one of the best old fashioneds he's ever had.  We had the wedge salad and crab cocktail for an appetizer. They were good, but nothing special or noteworthy.  However, our steaks were amazing. My husband got the coffee crusted steak with shallot butter and said it was amazing. I had the sliced filet with mushrooms, onions and fig sauce. The steak was cooked perfectly and the sauce added such a unique flavor, a little sweet, but SO good! We also had potatoes as a side that were delicious.  Our table was decorated with confetti and a happy anniversary card. And after our meal we received an anniversary dessert. It was so considerate and Capital Grille really goes above and beyond to make an occasion special. This is a fantastic spot for a special occasion or just a really great meal."}
{"text":"I have hit the Capital Grill twice now and neither time was impressive. I had the Ahi Steak and it was tasteless. I mean with sauces it was okay.. but nothing I would order again. The mushrooms were tasteless and the entire meal was forgettable. Service was good.. not great.. and its just isnt somewhere I will visit again."}
{"text":"Always wonderful!  The service is spectacular. Every time.   The steak is, of course, spectacular. There is nothing in this world that is more delicious that their Kona Crusted steak. Seriously.   It is the best place to eat in Pittsburgh. Always top shelf."}
{"text":"A good steakhouse with an even better view!! Even though there are much better higher end Steakhouses in Vegas, Capital Grill holds its own with an Amazing view of the strip if you are lucky enough to get a nicely situated window seat! Ask for it well in advance when making the reservation!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place and will be back when I come to Vegas. The steak was excellent, and the lobster bisque my wife had was as well."}
{"text":"I come here every chance I get when I come to las vegas.  Even though it is a chain, the steaks are very good here.    Lobster Mac is awesome!  I've had better steaks- but the bone in ribeye is hard to beat."}
{"text":"Everything a great steakhouse should be.  Excellent food, prepared exactly as requested ad/or described.  Among the best steaks in North America.  Extensive  wine list.  Cannot say enough good things about the place. My only caveat is that the wines are priced a bit higher than other, nearby restaurants.  The same bottle of Catena Malbec at the Capital Grille was $15 more than at the Yard House; still a great bottle for the money, and one is paying for the experience, but. . . .  Would eat here again and again.  Blows Morton's away."}
{"text":"Visited the Capital Grille with friends for dinner. Had the ribeye with lobster tail. Food was okay, didn't really appease the hype that I have heard from it. The lobster tail was  very tasty. Although the restaurant wasVery Pricey, good for special occasions or if you have cash to burn. Would go back."}
{"text":"We celebrated my dad's 80th birthday at the Scottsdale, Arizona Capital Grille. The staff was amazing from the initial scheduling of the event reservation through the entire evening. As always the food was exceptional. But it was the staff that made the evening what it was. They helped us decorate the room before the event. They made sure that we had refreshments while we were decorating. They served our meal efficiently and promptly. They cleared away the service items at the end of the meal so that we could enjoy the celebration cake together, which they prepared by the way. It was a memorable evening and my dad had a wonderful time. Thanks so much to the team at Capital Grill."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for mine and my girlfriends anniversary and let me say that it was one of the best dinner experiences we've ever had. Our server,who's name I cannot remember but was a rugby player, was extremely knowledgable on both the menu and drinks. Describing in detail about all ingredients and how how everything is prepared along with why they pair well together. He was very attentive and really knew how speak with us and the guest without making it awkward or bothersome. He really made our experience amazing! Sorry I don't remember his name because he really deserves recognition but I'm pretty sure he's the only rugby player there. They also set up our table with some nice decoration and wrote us a handwritten anniversary card.  The food was on a whole other level of delicious. We started off with the Lobster and crab cakes and the calamari. Both the best I've ever had! The calamari was nice and spicy but not to the point where it was uncomfortable to eat. The lobster/crab cakes tasted fresh and where nicely sized. Our main course was the tenderloins and butter-seared lobster. Best lobster tail I've ever had! The steak was juicy and perfectly cooked to temp. Our side to share was the lobster mac and cheese, let me just say it blew my mind! Not too salty or over cheesed  and had a good amount of lobster portioned in. Our server brought us complimentary dessert with \"happy anniversary\" written on the plate, which was really nice of him. Now I don't usually like cheese cake but this cheese cake was delicious and i loved it!   Overall wonderful food and service! The decor is very upscale and nice with a nice view of the strip!"}
{"text":"seriously....   very expensive and not worth it.  Had a $50+ steak and more than half of it was not near as good as what I cook at home.  We were with another older couple that like the ambiance and wait staff.  I was disappointed that our friend ordered a shrimp cocktail, a Mozzarella Tomato salad and a lobster tail and the waiter never commented on how much food he ordered.  the salad alone would have fed all four of us.  Just a simple - \"you could share the salad, it's plenty\" would have been OK, but nothing.  for two of us, a salad, a soup, a steak and a salmon dish with two glasses of reasonably priced wine ($13) and we were almost $200 with the tip (small at that).  That is my last time trying Capital Grill."}
{"text":"Amazing steaks and sides impeccable service from the friendly staff. One of our favor tires for special occasions. The porter house is one of my favorites but they also have a delicious seafood selection. Ah don't forget to try their Lobster Bisque. Also enjoying the Generous Pour which comes once a year with great wine selections. Cheers and Bon appetite"}
{"text":"Went to the Sunday Brunch.. Awesome food... Good service,, very enjoyable"}
{"text":"Free valet parking. Nice touch.  Had the stoli Doli, very smooth. You need to try it.  Calamari with cherry peppers , nice variation.  A new favorite.  Filet was cooked just how I love it.  The sides weren't as big as other steak houses, less to go around.  Overall, a very nice experience. Yes pricey but some things you need to try.   This is one of them."}
{"text":"Mozzarella, tomato and prosciutto appetizer was light and tasty, a perfect precursor to a good, juicy steak.  My sliced filet served on a bed of mushrooms and caramelized onions in a sumptuous jus was very tasty.  I'll be looking out for Restaurant Week deals like many others here."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant/bar with great view of the strip. Service was excellent and server was very knowledgeable and friendly. Yummy drinks in the bar that actually contained alcohol. Not watered down. Menu is a la carte with good size side dishes that you can share. Waygu beef special was amazing. Also the scallops. I asked for the scallops to be cooked a little more than the usual rare that you get. They were perfect. Friends had Delmonico steak and swordfish. Swordfish was disappointing. Almost raw and no flavor or seasoning. Lobster Mac and cheese was excellent. Grilled asparagus good but too salty. Overall, a fabulous meal and great service. Expensive but priced right for what you get."}
{"text":"I wanted to get a killer steak and we found our way to The Capital Grille. I am usually a bit gun shy with these high-end restaurants because they often times don't live up to the hype. This was NOT teh case with The Capital Grille! We made a reservation and were seated promptly. Our server was super personable and not snotty in the least bit, as I've experienced in the past with some of the high-end steakhouses. We were promptly sat and presented with menus and a drink menu. They had an extensive wine by the glass list and bottle list. WE started with the calimari with spicy peppers and pimento. Great dish, perfectly cooked fried calimari tossed with spicy peppers and garlic butter. i went with the house special, Kona crusted steak  (I switched the traditional sirloin for Delmonico) with shallot butter. Awesome, Awesome, Awesome! We also ordered the cream corn with bacon (most of the veggies, you can get in half orders and that's PLENTY for two people). The wife just had a cup of chowder and a great spinach salad with bacon, onions and bacon vinaigrette. All in all, great meal and awesome service. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch with some colleagues and had the tuna. It was a bit overcooked and clearly not fresh. The ball of rice was also okay. The green beans were steamed fine. My colleague's ribeye sandwich was apparently pretty good but why go here when youre not on business?"}
{"text":"BAM...they nailed it tonight.  I was offered a black Napkin when I walked in and all 3 of our steaks were perfectly cooked!  And dayum, that cheesecake. Best cheesecake I have ever tasted. Way to earn 5 stars, Capital Grille!!!!"}
{"text":"For service, we give Capital Grille an A+. From the greeter to the servers to management, we are always impressed with their commitment to making our experience memorable. Unfortunately, we are not huge fans of the food. No matter how we order, the steaks always come out badly charred. The desserts are fantastic."}
{"text":"Brand-new construction and beautiful building. It's located in the trendy Legacy Village. The service was friendly and overall good. Felt the prices were a bit high especially for Northeast Ohio. I ordered a bone in filet and it was $63. I feel like I spent less in Las Vegas or New York city but it was a good steak. The sides were good and cocktails are good. The only thing I didn't like was the crock of French onion soup. Was not that hot and was lacking flavor. Wanted to give Nathan a shout out behind the bar. Was very friendly and attentive employee. I will be back."}
{"text":"The epitome of a pompous corporate steakhouse.  Go there to show your friends, or tell yourself you can waste dining dollars, and for no other reason!  I guess it's the natural byproduct of an expense account banking town."}
{"text":"Linda worked to make our lunch party memorable and delicious.  the service and attention to detail was unparalleled.  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"The Capital Grille has pretty amazing food and service overall though the food took awhile to get to the table, it was worth the wait. You are looking to spend 15&up on a plate. The sides will cost you more since everything you order such as steaks, lobster, & etc come on its own with nothing else. Don't be surprise if you bill comes out to be 70& up."}
{"text":"Husband and I enjoyed an impromptu visit to this restaurant one snowy afternoon before heading to the Strip District.  We didn't have reservations, but we were able to be seated immediately.   There was a busy lunch crowd with people doing working lunches.   Husband ordered tenderloin sliders with the Parmesan truffle fries.  These were worth trip.  I chose roasted chicken with risotto.  Everything was excellent. Alfonso was our waiter.  In spite of having several tables, he couldn't have been friendlier or more attentive.  This is a pricey place for lunch for someone like me, but I will remember this visit."}
{"text":"Best restaurant downtown, no question about it.    Pricey but worth it for a special occasion.    I had the grilled salmon with a tomato and mango salad, it was fantastic, best piece of fish I have had in a while.    Older crowd is a detractor."}
{"text":"After eating it nearly every steakhouse in Scottsdale, I have to say I do think the food here was the best. And our waiter Kevin was fantastic. However the dated decor and heads of dead animals all over the walls (as well as a huge stuffed bald eagle right in the middle of one dining room) was completely depressing. I'm obviously a meat eater, but I don't need that with my dinner. It really bothered us and we won't return. We also thought it was odd the girl at the front desk had no idea how many locations this chain had or where it started. Seriously! Also there seemed to be plenty of staff, but no one was cleaning up the crumbs and food on the floor at the table next to us the entire time. This place could be a gold mine if they updated the interior and gave some of their staff better training. Honestly we would go all the time. But everyone in my office talks about how dated this place is. I hope they make some changes soon because we would love to go more"}
{"text":"If I could give 10 times 10 stars I would.    From the time you make a reservation to the check comes, nothing but 1st class.   I have visited many times with always Excellent Service, Food, And Libations.   What else can one say about such an outstanding run establishment.  Keep it up.  \"I'll be back\"!"}
{"text":"First visit to CG and had very pleasant experience. Not a fan of most chain restaurants, especially of the upscale, but CG lived up to its reputation. Had business lunch in a bit of a rush but my grilled salmon over Cesar salad was fresh and delicious. Service was accommodating for our group."}
{"text":"Incredible!!! One of my favorite restaurants!   Angel was a great server! She did everything right and can't say enough great things about her.   ·Butternut squash soup- sampled, very good but tasted like pumpkin pie and wasn't exactly what I was craving.   ·Salad- Very good - Always fresh! I like the parmesan  vinaigrette and the Cesar dressing best.   ·Mashed potatoes- Amazing! The best I've had in Charlotte!!!! I will be back for these time and time again!  ·Asparagus with lemon- perfectly cooked and tender. Really great flavors. If you like asparagus these are wonderful!   Friends dishes:  ·French Fries- I didn't care for them, but my friend really enjoyed them.   ·Tuna & rice- Really fabulous dish! My friend said it's by far one of the best in Charlotte.  ·Lobster - She said it was rubbery, and she wouldn't get it again.   ·Sword Fish - Excellent! My friend loved it!! She said it was the best.  ·Filet mignon- my friend said it was perfect and really good"}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night and it was horrible. Can truthfully say I would have rather had mc Donald's. I had the kona steak and it was tough and gritty. The scalloped potatoes are worse than steak 44, domincks, and ocean club for sure...they don't even compare. My girlfriend had the mushroom risotto and scallops and she said the scallops were the worst she had...I tried one and spit it out it was so chewy(I promise it was that bad) she then didn't eat the mushrooms on top and I said put them on my steak...I tried one and it too was like rubber...I guess they were dried mushrooms, which were disgusting. Expensive meal, crappy food, ruined our night. Wedge salad was the only good thing we had."}
{"text":"In boston I would frequent the Capital Grille. Never a mistake made by them and would always go in almost monthly. 6 weeks ago I had some friends in town and we decided to hit the capital grille. I had accidentally made my reservation for the wrong night but they accommodated us anyways which was much appreciated. The waiter was great but my steak came out extremely undercooked so I sent it back and they returned my same cut in half steak that was now burnt and I couldn't enjoy it but still had to pay. Meanwhile we had a 500 dollar tab- I find this unacceptable out of a restaurant this nice so will have to start frequenting Sullivan's who I am confident would make this right."}
{"text":"Exceptional food with an amazing view of the Las Vegas Strip truly a must see while in Las Vegas very attentive staff and knowledgeable about items on the menu five stars!"}
{"text":"Fantastic dining experience.  Bone in filetmwas to die for.  Carlos was an amazing server who went above and beyond to make our experience memorable.   Not cheap but a great value, food and service were outstanding."}
{"text":"We are big fans of Capital Grill and enjoy it for lunch, drinks, dinners, & special occasions. 5 stars! because they deliver all the goods ... food quality, service, professional grade staff, location, and ambience.  So, let's compare and contrast them to the competition; Ruth's Chris, Fleming's, Morton's, McCormick and Schmick's, Sullivan's, Chima, and BLT Steak.  Ruth's Chris ... feels like a prom-night teen dinner experience in comparison  Fleming's ... waaaay over-rated and unpolished, a tourist village, the fifties called and they want their restaurant back  Morton's ... elite, but stop pitching it to me, I'm already sitting at the table  McCormick and Schmick's ... eating fish in a large cafeteria setting with cheap carpeting  Sullivan's Steakhouse ... the opposite of Capital Grill, all-around bad  Chima Brazilian Steakhouse ... all you can stand to eat of B-level cuisine   BLT Steak ... their core competency is running a great hotel  You get the idea. I'm hard to please and I really like Capital Grill. The only minor ding I have for them is this. My wife and I have dined here for fifteen years; everything from late lunches to very special occasions. Why is it every time we are seated, the first question is; \"have you dined with us before?\""}
{"text":"Looks like we found our new favorite steakhouse! We tried their summer wine promotion called \"The generous pour.\" It was one of the best wine pairing experience. They have 7 wines, all 90+ rated, 4 reds and 3 white (pic attached) and for $28 per person you can have unlimited tastings of these 7 wines.  We ordered their sliced filet oscar with lump crab, filet mignon, fresh mozerella and basil salad and sweet corn soup. Everything was excellent.  Our server Chuck was the best! He was so efficient and funny! He got my husband a special dessert for his birthday. I can't wait to go back.   Update!! Of course service is still stellar, this time our server was Amy, so awesome, pleasant and efficient. Amy had us try cheesecake and if you are not a cheesecake fan like me, you gotta try their cheesecake! It's soooo good, has this creme brûlée like crust on top,  vanilla cookie crust on bottom and center is the perfect texture of  ricotta.. it's so good that I forgot to take a pic"}
{"text":"Food was fine. Service at the bar horrific.  Waited over 15 minutes to order a drink.  No bread until I asked.  Food took almost an hour.  Never asked if I wanted another drink.  I did but oh well."}
{"text":"I am so happy to have found this establishment. This steakhouse went above and beyond my expectations. The service, food and decor were outstanding.   We came here on a Saturday night to celebrate a birthday and they truly gave us the royal treatment. They sat us by the window overlooking the Vegas Strip, had the table decorated with birthday confetti and birthday card, gave us complimentary tastings of two drinks, and provided a generous  sampling of their desserts with a birthday candle.   The server Dominic was amazing and extremely helpful in helping us decide on our meal for the evening. He was a significant contributor to why we had such a fantastic time. Not only was he helpful with food recommendations but he also gave us tips on which casino games were statistically more likely to pay out and also asked some of his colleagues for recommendations on where to go to get the most bang for our buck. We were sort of new to the whole gambling world and appreciated his insights.   The food was AMAZING. My friend whose birthday we celebrated stated that her bone in fillet was THE BEST steak she had ever had. I had the bone in NY strip with Gorgonzola and savoured it to the last bite. I was amazed that I had almost finished the entire strip. They cooked both steaks perfectly (med rare). We ordered the Brussel sprouts with bacon and the mushroom plate for our sides and really enjoyed both. We were glad not to have ordered something more heavy because we were stuffed by the end of the meal. My friend and I also shared a bottle of red that we absolutely loved also. I am so happy they include ratings for the wines that are rated 90 points or higher so we were able to choose a bottle that was guaranteed to be good. I even took a photo of the bottle so I can try to purchase it elsewhere. The trio of desserts they provided were amazing as well. Our favorite was the coconut cream pie but the cheesecake and chocolate cake were also delicious. I have absolutely no criticisms to offer because the entire experience was remarkable.   Thank you Dominic and The Capital Grill for providing such a wonderful experience for my friend's birthday. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is for the rich kids that had never eaten any other fine food in the world other than steaks : ) Pricy steak (cow that is not even organically raised). Salmon that is farm raise(Atlantic). The steak that is almost tasteless. Veggies that are plain but buttery. The server was kind of racist (only asked what my white friend wants to drink, didn't ask me, and then brings me water). The only good thing about this place is the interior itself. The dinner alone was 83 dollars(split amount 3 people). If you have friends that want to get you there please steer them away because both of your stomach and wallet will leave unsatisfied."}
{"text":"What can I say, I heard it was a great place for steaks, but my 23 year old son, myself and my parents give it a 8/10. The other restaurant being a 10/10. So you would like to know what the other restaurant is, okay it's Durant's, outstanding service, food for the most discerning palate.   The ambiance at Capital Grille was stately and becoming of a steak restaurant. For the price I was expecting amazing. I was sadly disappointed. You can expect to pay $80-$100 person for soup/salad, entree, side dishes, no liquor, tax, and tip.   Our waitress was Janet, she was very pleasant. Unfortunately, her helpers didn't do their joy very well. We seemed to have to wait forever to have dirty dishes removed , water glasses refilled, or our order taken for desert. It has the feel of a chain restaurant, good but not great. We were new to Capital Grille. We went for my Mother's birthday. Not sure I'll be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Another excellent meal at Capital Grille. Salad was fresh and delightful as well as plentiful.  Bread basket fresh and delish especially the pumpernickel raisin bread.   Kona Sirloin steak grilled perfectly.   Chicken Confit expertly done and most of all NOT overcooked which is easy to do with chicken. Accompanied by fingerling potatoes, pearl onions, and au jus.  Just yummy.  Mashed potatoes needed a little salt but tasted very good.  Haricot verts (as the french say) were thin and delicate and cooked \"al dente\" -- to the tooth.  Nothing worse than overcooked string beans, but these were perfect.   AND LAST but not least.... the chocolate flourless cake............nothing short of amazing..... The service was extraordinary as usual.....  The place is expensive but NOT overpriced.  The food and service is worth every nickel.   I hate reading reviews where people say it is overpriced.  If you feel you don't want to pay their prices then don't go .  But don't eat their delicious, well prepared food and then complain about pricing.  You saw the menu going in.  If you have a lousy meal then I understand those complaints but I haven't had a bad meal there yet.   Kudos to the staff who work so hard to make us  patrons enjoy our meal from start to finish."}
{"text":"This is a must when my wife comes with me to Vegas.  I like the place but she loves it. The lobster bisque is the bomb."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I chose to dine in super late after a long day of meetings. Nonetheless, the service was exceptional. The food however was just ok. I ordered scallops which were not served hot. I also got potato and leak soup, which was different than expected (no chunks of potatoes, all purèed). On top of that we had several different appetizers at the table, but none stood out. Overall, I feel like the meal was overpriced for what I received."}
{"text":"This place has very good food.  The waiter Matthew was very attentive. The Lobster Roll was good, the tenderloin sliders very tender, great soup, yummy housemade great fruit soda.  20 bucks is the minimum.  I forgot to take pictures of the food.  My bad."}
{"text":"Very fancy place, we went wearing shorts and they didn't mind, considering its 100 degrees outside it makes sense :P I ordered the ginger tuna and my date had the roasted chicken, I forgot which chardonnay we had but they have a very impressive wine selection and it was perfect."}
{"text":"one of the best places I've found in the Charlotte area that I can actually eat and enjoy. this is my favorite place in all of North Carolina. best food. A+++++"}
{"text":"First off, the service was the best. Our server Randee took her time in providing a brief run down of the menu. She made suggestions which and we both never ran out of water or tea. The calamari was great, no need for any type of condiment that normally comes with a Calamari. The steak was phenomenal I am not a steak person, BUT i literally asked my husband if I could have his food .we made reservations for our Anniversary and they made it extra special with rose, card, complimentary desert and champagne Overall, it was great experience!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest- we only ate here because we were given a $100 gift card. This made a ridiculously expensive restaurant cost about as much as it would cost us on an average night out. We skipped drinks and dessert (we were really too full of other stuff anyway!) and our bill still came to $114 before tip. I was surprised that the dress code was so casual for such a nice place; my husband and I dressed up (hey, it's not every day that we eat so fancy!) but we saw folks there in shorts and flip flops, too.  We started with the delicious bread, and calamari. The calamari was spicy, and it would have been better with some sort of dipping sauce, but I guess that isn't classy enough for the Capital Grille! I just squeezed lemon juice all over my plate and it was delicious.  I ordered the citrus-glazed salmon for my entree, with a spinach salad and warm bacon dressing on the side. The salmon was a very generous portion that was very well done. I'm very picky when it comes to salmon and I found this to be fresh and delicious. The salmon also came resting on a generous bed of asparagus, onions, etc. which was an unexpected surprise as we'd been told that all sides were a la carte. I definitely could have skipped the spinach salad, just because I already had so much food and we were staying in a hotel without a mini fridge. But the salad itself was delicious- more of a dinner portion than a side, actually.  My husband ordered the steak and lobster. At $49 it was one of the more expensive entrees on the menu, yet is was a LOT smaller than my salmon (which was $33). He was disappointed at the size for that price, actually. But it still managed to be large enough that he couldn't finish it, with the bread and calamari he'd already eaten. The steak and lobster were both delicious, though.  The service was impeccable. Our server, Denise, was friendly and attentive and very knowledgeable. I would highly recommend the Capital Grille for anyone looking for a nice steak or seafood dinner."}
{"text":"I can't speak more highly of our visit to the Capital Grille last night!   We have eaten here maybe 7 times now and I have never been to a more consistently hospitable restaurant.   To preface, I spent 10 years in the service industry and would consider myself to have high restaurant standards compared to others. My family and friends hate eating with me because I know what good service is and expect it (as should anyone paying to have a meal prepared and served to their liking).   Now that you have the flavor of what kind of restaurant snob I am, let me tell you why The Capital Grille deserves five stars...  When we arrived for our reservation, we were politely greeted and promptly sat. I saw the sign for their HUGE wine event and as a non drinker immediately thought \"ugh, I hope they don't hate us because we aren't planning on drinking.\"   While our server was still with her other tables, our waters were filled, an iPad to browse wines and desserts was offered and bread brought to our table.   When our server Katie, whom I have never met, made it over to our table she warmly greeted us like we were regulars, using my name from our reservation. From there she fielded our questions and took our order.  On her recommendation, I ordered the surf and turf which consisted of a Filet and African Lobster Tail (I had only ever had the Maine tail), the hubby ordered a Filet and of course we ordered the Lobster Mac to share. To start we had a crock of French Onion soup (truly the best I've ever had) and the wedge salad (always good until I remember how much more I like the soup) that we shared. I was almost full before our meals came!  Our meals arrived, the presentation gorgeous, so excited to eat the biggest lobster tail I had ever seen! I cut into my filet, slightly undercooked but delicious. I'm a medium rare kind of girl so I'll take under vs over any day and I wasn't overly concerned because I had the huge tail and I could take the filet to eat the next day :) The hub's filet was cooked to perfection and the Lobster Mac was steamy and delicious as it always is.   Now the tail... It was beautiful and from Africa so I couldn't wait! To my disappointment, it had a really fishy taste to it :( since I've never had an African tail before and had nothing to compare it to, I wasn't going to say anything. Katie came over and could tell I didn't love it. I didn't want to make a big deal about it but within minutes she had whisked that away and came out with what I know and love- the Maine tails. I was so impressed and my tastebuds were dancing with delight!   After we were stuffed with deliciousness our table was cleared and scraped to the cloth. Katie presented us with a gift from the restaurant- a beautiful arrangement of 2 of their desserts and berries on a plate that had \"Just Married\" written in chocolate sauce. Not only was it so incredibly thoughtful and beautiful, it was delicious! We were so excited and felt so special!  If that wasn't enough, at some point during our meal Katie had asked us if there was a reason we weren't drinking and I shared with her that we just don't drink alcohol at all. I assumed she wanted to talk wines with us but she was respectful and that was it. After our dessert was cleared, she brought us over non-alcoholic sparkling soda with sorbet in martini glasses so we could have something to toast our wedding over!!! What an incredibly thoughtful gesture!!!!  Our visit was last night and as I am writing this review today, I know this will be an experience we will remember forever. Some of these reviews talk about the weird decor or overpriced food but I promise you there is no dollar amount you can put on making your guests feel like they are the only ones there and that all you want to do is make them happy.   My 5 stars clearly include the service, quality of the food, cleanliness of the restaurant and bathrooms and overall experience.   Thank you Capital Grille for a night to remember. I look forward to our next visit :)"}
{"text":"A nice sirloin steak (NY cut according to the waiter) would not be so thick and not be chewy either.  Dry aged steak?  They just aren't supposed to be chewy.  The side dishes were mediocre.  The bread on the other hand was nice because of the large selection they offer.  The raisin wheat bread was the best.    It didn't help that it was late and we were very hungry.    Again, steak is not supposed to be chewy.  One would expect much more for the price."}
{"text":"This place was great! my father made a reservation  before leaving Vegas and to doing some last minute shopping. Its a great place to have a family lunch/ dinner. the staff was so friendly and welcoming; they didn't even make us wait, they sat us right away.  I wish I remembered our servers name but she was phenomenal! she was so attentive and ready to answer any questions we had about menu items. I decided to order the French onion soup (Best I've ever had! I wish I ordered a bowl) and lobster and crab cake sandwich (It was okay), My mother ordered the burger (Delicious), My little sister ordered the filet mignon (Made to perfection), and my father ordered the clam chowder (So good!) and prim rib sandwich (The best meal at the table; wish I ordered this!). Prior to us ordering, however my father was complaining about the cheese on the sandwich, which if you knew my father at all he is extremely picky! So our waitress decided to bring him out a sample of the cheese that would come on the sandwich, lo and behold.. he loved it! I thank her for actually getting him to try something new! Once we were all done with our meals our server decided to bring us a complimentary cheesecake. this cheesecake was the most creamiest cheesecake I've ever eaten, words cannot even explain how delicious it was!   Overall I give this restaurant a 5 star rating! I give it 5 stars because of its excellence, quality, cleanliness, and amazing staff! I will definitely be coming back on my next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try The Capital Grille for so long because I heard how amazing their lobster Mac n Cheese was. Well, they were right...it was delicious! Normally, I wouldn't like that combination but it's actually the best mac n cheese I have ever had. I also ordered a filet and french onion soup. The soup was delicious!  The restaurant has a nice view of the strip and easy access from the Fashion Show Mall garage or the side valet. (by Trump Tower)  There are a lot of good steakhouses in town but The Capital Grille is my new favorite!"}
{"text":"The service and food were awesome. We are at the bar and the gentlemen working back there were great. They were super busy the entire time but they made it a point to chat with us. The food was out of this world and the portion sizes were large. I will definitely go back the next time I stay in the Downtown area."}
{"text":"So I was saving up for a delicious, pricey meal after a successful business event. I walked by the \"chain\" steakhouses like Ruth Chris or McCormick and Schmicks to go to what I thought was a more local joint... Well I should have done more research because it's another chain. But the wait staff was incredibly nice and helped me pick out a nice aged prime rib eye. I'm seriously excited for this steak... I get the steak and it looked great.  One bite into it and unfortunately it was disappointing. It lacked salt or really any seasoning even though this was one of their specialty steaks. The wonderful waitress offered to take it back but I was not going to let a quality steak go back. I know it's still a good steak but I should not have to add flavor to steal in this price point! I jokingly asked for A-1 but would never ruin a steak like that. It was still a decent meal and the wait staff was awesome, but I did leave underwhelmed and wishing I picked a different steak house."}
{"text":"Look no further than The Capital Grille for Las Vegas's most consistent Steak.  I was pretty excited when I was told we would be having dinner at Capitale Grille as part of a recent bachelor party weekend in Vegas. I am a huge devotee of this national chain - and I usually hate national chains - but everything from the service to the incredible Steaks makes Capitale Grille a best-in-class Steakhouse. The interior at Capital Grille exudes class with its dark woods, Tiffany chandeliers, and brass accents. The service has been just as polished as the brass railings on every occasion making this the go to spot for congratulatory dinners.   My current fave appetizer has to be the Steak Tartare with Truffle Deviled Egg although I am easily persuaded to the Smoked Salmon if company insists. As for a salad, it is summertime and the Caprese will never disappoint thanks to that wonderfully salty and loose cheese employed with the vine ripe tomato halves. I should also add that their Burger is seriously solid and features Chopped Sirloin, Smoked Bacon, and Sweet Onion. A must do for any power lunch (or otherwise).  As for Steak of choice? It is tough, The Capital Grille seems to sear an impeccable medium rare on anything and therefore I always find it a chore deciding what to get. My usual choice is their tremendous Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin with Shallot Butter because it is simply fantastic and the meat seems to melt as you chew. Another total win is the Snake River Farms Wagyu Filet, but be warned it is incredibly rich and flavorful. A little goes a very long way. The Dry Aged Steak au Poivre with Courvoisier Cream is another wonderful choice and boasts a Sirloin with a black peppercorn kick. All Steak should be enjoyed with an order of Au Gratin Potatoes to share with the table. Topped with potato chips (no, that is not Panko).  For the ladies, I would most certainly give a nod to the Filet Oscar with lump Dungeness Crab that is riddled with an intense Béarnaise sauce or go all in with the Seared Tenderloin with Butter Poached Lobster Tails. You really cannot lose.   I am a gigantic proponent of The Capital Grille's Steak creations and will be back next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Although service was excellent and the atmosphere, the food lacked flavor and spice. $300 later and was disappointed with the taste of our meals. Please don't  get me wrong the quality of the food was great just need something extra."}
{"text":"We went there while on business for my bosses retirement/birthday dinner.  The manager seated us in a private room and took care of every detail.  The food was spectacular.  I had the surf and turf and that was cooked perfectly.  My boss enjoyed the Lobster Bisque and loved it.  The wine selection was very complete and our server knew a lot about what we had to choose from.  Other guests ordered The salmon and the bone in filet.  They both were made perfectly!   And to add the perfect touch we did get a complementary birthday plate with chocolates and berries."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of friends because we wanted to have a nice steak dinner before we drove home the next day. What a restaurant! The outside had 2 lion sculptures to greet us as we walked past pillars to the front door. Once we went inside, the wood and all the paintings that surrounded us made us feel like we were in a big dining room of a wealthy person!kudos to whoever made the interior!  Now, onto the food! The bread was pretty good. Crusty rolls, a dark bread with fruit and nuts and a nice crispy lavosh. A good start.  My friend ordered the lobster bisque. So rich and creamy with big chunks of lobster! A definite must have if you love lobster.  Next, the steaks. I had the NY strip medium rare. One of the best steaks I've ever had. Very well seasoned. The second steak I've ever had without any A1. And I looooooove A1 sauce with steak if it's not seasoned enough or if it needs some kind of sauce.  For the sides, we got the potatoes au gratin and lobster mac and cheese. I love potatoes au gratin and these potatoes were just about perfect. Creamy and cheesy and perfectly done layers of potatoes with a crunchy Parmesan cheese crust. Absolutely delicious! The lobster mac and cheese was really good. Creamy sauce, al dente macaroni and big chunks of lobster with a crunchy panko breadcrumbs. Tasty but not as good as the potatoes au gratin.  This is one of the beat steakhouses I've ever been to. The ambiance and atmosphere just blew my mind! And our waiter Chris was the nicest, kindest waiter to me and my friends.   So if you have a craving for  great steak, great atmosphere and great service, look no further than the Capital Grille!"}
{"text":"Great place. A bit pricey. They catered for vegans which was great, but not much options."}
{"text":"Best steakhouse in Scottsdale.  Steaks are always done to perfection and not overly seasoned like they are at Mastro's and City Hall.  Wait staff is trained and knowledgeable about food preparation.  Wines are not over priced like other Scottsdale restaurants and served at the proper temperature.  Brian Schwartztrauber is the best General Manager in the city.  He is on top of his game and always interacts with his clientele adding to your dining experience.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Need no occasion, they make the day/night a special one! Absolute class from the minute your seated! Ambiance, staff and food were spectacular!  Angel our waitress was the best!!"}
{"text":"My favorite steakhouse in Charlotte! Yes it's a chain, but not every Capital Grille gets 5 stars from me. For example, the one in Chicago is 4, mainly due to ambiance. The was the first restaurant I went to when I moved to Charlotte and continues to be a place to go for dinner or dessert after dinner somewhere else. For me, the best cheesecake in town. Great patio for outdoor seating. Great open bar with top notch service. This is a place to indulge for dinner and wine. Both menus are impressive. Open kitchen concept makes the feeling in the restaurant a little more lively.  The Delmonico steak is great as well as the filet. Depending on the size of the lobster tail that night, getting it as an appetizer is a sure way to make the bill skyrocket, but hey, we only live once!"}
{"text":"Quite a splurge, but totally worth it. My brother and I both got cocktails. He the in fashion and I the mojito - both good. Our server, Tim, was super kind and helpful with suggestions. We ended up both getting ribeyes, he the Kona rubbed and I the balsamic. One of the best steaks I've had in my life. The roasted mushrooms on the side were amazing as well. Overall a fantastic meal and atmosphere"}
{"text":"Pretty expensive but a wonderful atmosphere and delicious food. I went with a group of 10 people and our server waited on us hand and foot. A friend in our group was pretty drunk when we got there, but the server was so patient and even laughed at his antics ( not that he was terrible, but a bit loud and constantly making lame jokes). I don't think there was anything anyone got that they didn't love. I had oysters on a half shell and a cup of clam chowder soup. Both were delicious. My husband had a steak which he devoured, plus we ordered 3 bottles of wine. Yikes! Definitely a big bill, but it was our friend's birthday so we had splurged a little. Will go here again for sure. Maybe we will try to not drink so much wine though next time. (it cost almost double compared to what you would pay at total wine or grocery store)."}
{"text":"Very upscale with excellent food. I had the surf and turf, which included sirloin and lobster tails, and were both cook to perfection. The lobster and macaroni and cheese was excellent.  The waitstaff was excellent and very attentive. All menu items are sold individually, so choosing entrées and adding sides can get expensive quickly. We were way too full to eat dessert.  Including the tip, the bill came to $175 without drinks, appetizers, or desserts. Plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Had a 50th anniversary luncheon at the restaurant on Thursday.  The entire staff greeted us with a card, a picture and a dessert.  The service and the food were wonderful.  The steak and fish dishes could not have been better.  It was a terrific experience and we will return soon."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a whim and were immediately told by the hostess that the restaurant is booked for the evening. We still proceeded to peruse the bar and there was a perfect empty table where we indulged in delicious wine and great food with fantastic service. Tourist trap expected and it was far beyond."}
{"text":"We were fortunate enough to be preview diners at this restaurant. We had not eaten at a Capital Grille previously. They were busy, but handled it well. Drinks were pricey, but eclectic and good. The Fire and Ice margarita, especially.  French onion soup was very good, the spinach salad, also. We had the sea scallops, which were very good, and the bone in filet mignon, which was excellent and cooked perfectly. They have family-style sides, and the lobster mac and cheese was to die for! To finish we had creme brulee, which was also excellent. Service was attentive and friendly. We will be back, but not often because steakhouses are pricey!"}
{"text":"So I had a date today. He asked me where I would like to go and one of my favorite restaurants to eat at is the Capital Grille. Yeah yeah I know, I might be a bit spoiled. The prices are not cheap, but what the heck, I wasn't paying. Just kidding, LOL. He was a very nice guy and very thoughtful and generous to take me to The Capital Grille. Who knows maybe this will go somewhere;) XOXO."}
{"text":"The interior is nice, in classic style.  The meal mostly is very good, everyone was happy with his/her entrees. filet minion was really good, salads are mostly pretty typical. The service is not bad. A bit slowly, but probably it is their idea - those who go to this restaurant are not in rush. Also, we had had a big menu card, and had no idea where to put it in between appetizers, salads and entrees as we need to order them consistently, like salads only after we done with appetizers and so on. They should think about that and provide some option to not to hold those big cards on hands all the time. This took off one star. It is pricy.  We have had dinner for 5, with vine, it costed more than $600. This is why I'm giving 3 stars. If it has a bit less prices it would be great, but so far it seems to me overpriced."}
{"text":"Absolutely what dining is supposed to be.  Amazing food & wine but most of all, the service (Frank was our waiter) and ambiance was top notch.  First time here but will definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This is certainly a fancy place so imagine how I felt getting off the elevator in shorts, a t-shirt and backward hat.  Despite my dress I was nicely welcomed by the hostess who directed me to an area set aside for our private group.  While there we were treated to all the appetizers and free booze we could handle.  I especially liked the chicken skewers prepared with some sort of Indian spice.  The Capital Grille is located inside the Fashion Show mall, but well away from the crowds.  The dining area has lots of windows with great views of the strip.  I would definitely come back here (properly dressed) for a date night or a business meal.  The have bottles of wine along the walls dedicated to famous people.  I especially took note of the Edward Kennedy bottle, since it was the evening of his memorial.  I can only give four stars right now because my experience was atypical.  But once I experience an actual meal here, I'm sure it will get a full five."}
{"text":"................Queens  Feast  2017...Excellent  steaks...Highly  recommend. ......yummmmm..........."}
{"text":"The Capital Grille is an upscale steak restaurant, located in Las Vegas' Fashion Show mall. I have been to the CG in Miami/Brickell several times, but just recently had ate at the one in Vegas. Service in both locations is very good and the food is delicious. We usually order:  -chopped salad -french onion soup -bone-in ribeye with chimichurri sauce -au gratin potatoes -sauteed spinich -sauteed mushrooms  All the sides are large enough for sharing and the chimicurri sauce is spiced just right.  CG is perfect for a client lunch or a semi-casual dinner with friends."}
{"text":"Nice classy restaurant with excellent steak and shellfish. My favorite part is that they took all the lobster out of the shell and served it so I didn't have to get my hands dirty. The steaks are a good sized portion and the white table cloths make for a fancy date night! Pricey but worth it and will recommend!"}
{"text":"FYI - the two stars is related to service during recent business dinner.  The main courses were excellent (I had the halibut and probably the best cut of fish I have eaten this year)!  The sides, mashed potatoes and creamed spinach were warm at best, when delivered to table and cold midway through meal.  Service was spotty from the location of our table, right on the corner of a busy pass through lane into the larger dining room.  Waiter disappeared for long stretches at a time.  Ordered a drink and thought I would have to go mix it myself.  After our main course he disappeared again and didn't ask if we wanted after dinner drinks/coffee.    We also got the vibe that they could care less about our business.  Indifferent service always gets me steamed.  Maybe an off night or maybe this is how they operate at this location.  I pass through Pittsburgh once or twice per year on business but probably won't be back to this location for a business dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing service. My server was Andy  he was attentive to my vast diet needs. The food was great I would of preferred a local company with regards to the fish and the shrimp was outsourced as well.  I would return definitely"}
{"text":"One of the best American Steakhouses. This is the second time I've been to this location, and I always leave feeling cared for. Pricey as hell, but well worth it. The food and service are impeccable."}
{"text":"Always a god choice. Last time I was there I got the steak tar tar and it was fabulous! The only downfall is that they have no beers on draft and not too many in bottles either, but they have really good cocktails. Good, fun place for a date but I usually go with my dad and just sit at the bar. The bar is also a god place to have a business meeting. They have my favorite little candies everywhere."}
{"text":"This is one of my FAVORITE places in Vegas ! The staff is always very professional and let me tell you these guys are on it! Thank you Maria, you rocked! And with a table of 10 she had her hands full... I am pretty sure by the end of the night she wanted to change her name as we called  for her so much. But she is a pro and everything was hot, well seasoned (thanks to chef) and delivered exactly at the right time!  Let's start with the calamari app and I love that they add hot cherry peppers into the calamari rings and tentacles, which is not for the faint of heart, it's spicy but delicious!  Then an order of the cast iron garlic shrimp which is also delicious! Get extra bread and enjoy the sauce in the pan!!  Then a couple of salads and one was the wedge with blue cheese and smoked bacon to which we ordered extra blue cheese and man did they bring a bucket of cheese! I could have just eaten the cheese! Quality blue is always my favorite. And they do it right!!! The table then enjoyed several of their lobsters which I find is always the best lobster and great quality in Vegas! I had Ahi tuna, which I tend to order a lot, and this was by far the best piece of AHI I had all week and I loved the sauces! The drinks and the desserts were also amazing!! We tried several different items and shared for the table!  Their martini's are an adult size not these mini me cocktails you get for $20 in these restaurants!  Their sides and are also worth mentioning as we enjoyed the truffle fries (a must), the lobster Mac and cheese which is Italian style so beautiful grated park on top of the pasta noodles then infused with lobster pieces and not to be missed the wild mushrooms...oh my!  For dessert we tried the house made desserts which includes the creme brûlée, the flourless chocolate espresso cake (super decadent), the warm double chocolate cake and finally the cheesecake.  I can only say I had one bite of the espresso cake and it was amazing!!! So frankly order away and enjoy!! You won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"I went here for restaurant week of Winter 2016.  Upon entering, warm greeting and the waiting area kept me cozy until my guest arrived. When seated, we had a very nice table in a not so crowded dining room, but gave us a great vantage point to be able to see everything that was going on.   Our server was very nice and attentive. I ordered a wedge salad, steak and cheesecake for dessert. The food was spot on and overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Just another amazing dinner at the Captial Grille Las Vegas!  You can't beat the strip view, beautiful restaurant and dynamite food.  Definitely do the Kona Sirloin and Lobster Mac and Cheese.  Thanks to our server Kristen C. for the awesome and professional service.  Everything was right on point and exactly how all my Captial Grille dining experiences have been.  Go check out this restaurant and ask for Kristen and a table with a view.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"In my opinion TCG is the best of all the upscale steakhouses in Pittsburgh. The waiters and waitresses are professional, super friendly, and know everything about the food they are serving you, as they should. Their assistants are also very professional and attentive, You'll never ask for a refill of water. The atmosphere is dark and sexy, many beautiful paintings hang on the walls. Best steaks you can get in Pittsburgh, hands down. I recommend the filet, gorgonzola and truffle crusted with cabernet reduction. The lobster mac and cheese is sinfully rich and filled with huge chunks of lobster. The truffle fries are as addicting as crack cocaine and the lobster bisque is perfect. One of my favorite restaurants in any city."}
{"text":"My boss treated myself and some coworkers here for lunch as our Holiday Meal.  I suggested this place because I had always heard good things.  I started with the French Onion Soup and then had the Shrimp and Grits as my entree.  I finished the meal with the Creme Brulee Cheesecake.  The French Onion Soup was tasty - nothing really remarkable to say.  I was pretty disappointed with my entree.  The shrimp were overcooked, rubbery and unable to be sliced with a fork.  The sauce that was over the dish was very thin, thus watering down the grits.  The dish was the consistency of soup.  The dessert was the best part of the meal.  The cheesecake was made with ricotta cheese and wasn't overly sweet.  Our server was helpful and attentive.  I was just rather unimpressed."}
{"text":"The Capital Grille has some pretty good steak, though I was not totally blown away -- everything was good, but there was nothing surprising or new. The wine selection is amazing, or maybe that was just the good taste of the guy in my group. Try the fresh berries with cream for dessert. Definitely better with an expense account!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, attentive service, a quiet retreat just above the LV strip. Capital Grille has everything you would expect out of a restaurant of this quality. As far as the food goes, I say you cannot go wrong with the Filet Oscar and the Banana Creme Pie."}
{"text":"A great night for our sons 21st bday celebration. Frankie, our waiter, was entertaining.  The porcini dusted rib eye was a perfect size to split with my wife and was as rich as it sounds with the added balsamic. Especially after the crab/lobster cakes and Caesar salad shared plates. The au graten potato's were not cooked enough for our us but still was tasty. Our sons  Kona crusted steak is not really as advertised. Not very crusted and not very seasoned    It was over cooked so maybe that contributed to the less than stellar plate. The free champagne and free bday desserts made up for the misses."}
{"text":"\"I'm in the mood for a juicy steak!\" are words that I rarely utter but  my experience at Capital Grille literally had me eating my words. On this night, my friends and I took advantage of The Capital Grille's Charlotte Restaurant Week menu that consisted of three courses. For my starter, I went with the Wedge salad topped with applewood smoked bacon and blue cheese. The salad was simply delicious and dressed perfectly with the right amount of dressing. For the second course, I chose the porcini rubbed tenderloin. This is the part where I drool... that steak, man that steak! That piece of meat was prepared and seasoned to perfection; it was hands down the best steak that I've ever had! This marvelous piece of heaven was served with green beans and mashed potatoes. And now for the grand finale: chocolate espresso cake (close your mouth) lol. This dessert was simply marvelous. The coffee and chocolate complimented each other making each bite better than the last. The texture of the cake was a hybrid between a mousse and a cake...very creamy. I can't end this review  without mentioning the impeccable service. We were seated nearly 20 minutes later than our reservation, but upon being seated, we were greeted and served with a smile for the remainder of our dining experience. Eating my words never tasted so good!"}
{"text":"I've never been so furious in a dining situation. I walked in without a reservation - the host could not have been more cold/rude. I didn't think much if it at first until he started seating others who walked in after me without reservations. I waited patiently until the point where I counted SIX open tables. At this point I have waited over an hour and fifteen minutes. It wasn't until I got visibly upset that I was seated. For a place that prides themselves on customer service they should be embarrassed. I can easily spend $100 on a dinner for one at a number of other restaurants down the street. Needless to say, I'll be taking my money elsewhere from now on and never come back."}
{"text":"I took some customers to Capital Grille this week.  Actually getting to the restaurant was difficult, at least for me, and I am pretty familiar with Uptown Charlotte.  Every turn that I needed to take was forbidden by either \"no left turn\" or \"no right turn\" signs.  I had to end up going several blocks out of my way and ultimately doing an illegal turn to get to the restaurant.  Finding parking is sort of difficult, as well.  From what I understand, Valet parking does not start until 6:00pm and I got to the restaurant at about 5:30pm.  I would recommend parking in the garage for the office building next door to the restaurant.  Capital Grille will validate your parking if you park there.  The food is very good, but also fairly expensive.  I had 8 people in my group and our total bill was right at $1,100.00 including tip.  This did include two bottles of mid-priced wine, though.  I had the 10 oz. Filet Mignon and it was very good.  As far as sides, I would recommend the Lobster Macaroni and Cheese and Au Gratin Potatoes.  We also got the seafood appetizer platter and it was decent, but nothing to write home about.  The desserts are large and very tasty."}
{"text":"Expected more than we received.  Steak was an excellent cut of meat but they delivered it crusty and just warm.  Lobster Mac and cheese was not good nor creamy potatoes-   Daryl our waiter was good, drinks- good , atmosphere was great.  Wish is would have been better"}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to eat here thanks to one of my friends very generous Christmas gift!! Ive only ever been in for drinks so dinner was a first!!  We sat in a big booth for just the 3 of us and I started with the Pineapple Stoli Doli and it is dangerous! I could have had like 10...I didn't but i could have! We started with the Shrimp Cocktail and Wagyu Beef Carpaccio both were good.   For my entree I had the Porcini Rubbed Delmonico Ribeye when it came out it was huge and perfectly cooked. We had gotten 3 sides starting with the Lobster Mac N Cheese which was very good, but like my friend said there was nothing that made it OMG!! We also had the Onion Rings, and Sauteed Spinach which were also good.  We had the Creme Brulee for dessert and that was perfectly lighter than I thought it was going to be and just the right amount of sweetness to finish the dinner.  Our server was very nice and helped when it came to picking out the wine and his suggestion was great we all enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Went here on the last day of Restaurant week for my friend's bachelor party.  They had an incredible $50 3-course prix fixed menu and got the wine tasting for $25.  While the food was top notch, the service from the staff and particularly our waiter Alex, was just incredible in every aspect.  Alex was very courteous and helpful in describing the menu items, made recommendations on the wine tasting and I think he was generous with the pourings since it was the last day of the promotion and they had some extra wine not on their normal menu.  We were his only table after another party left, so he was very attentive, but his bussers were also awesome.  The resturant week promotion also contributes to threequare.org which support local food banks so we got to make a positive contribution for our weekend of debauchery.  On to the food: I started out with the french onion soup, it's in a cup, so it's not a huge portion, but it was delicious.  Other folks got the caesar and wedge, no complaints from anyone on the starters.  I had the kona-crusted sirloin medium rare which I recommend.  It's on a hot plate so it cooks for a little bit.  Hint of coffee, but plenty of flavor in the crust and juicy meat.  The filets also got high marks from the bachelor, and the desserts were pretty good.  I don't like to frequent the same restaurants in Vegas since there's so much great food to try, but when they open a Capital Grille in San Diego, I'll be at the ribbon cutting!"}
{"text":"I came to the bar with a friend.  We had the crab cakes which were absolutely phenomenal.  2 heavily packed Crab and Lobster chunk patties, with a nice Aioli."}
{"text":"We went to Capital Grille during Restaurant Week and my steak was not good. I did a review on the site for Restaurant Week and the response from CG management was immediate and gracious. They rolled out the red carpet to give us a better experience and boy, did they deliver! The general manager came by our table, the marketing director. Every bite of food was delicious. It was our anniversary and the table was strewn with fresh rose petals. Excellent in every way!"}
{"text":"Great food and Atmosphere. Location is perfect to catch a bite before a show at the amphitheater. very Pricey though."}
{"text":"We arrived for our dinner reservation at 5pm, and the whole place was empty, Made our dinner a little bit awkward in such a large dining room to ourselves. The waiters were great and service good. The food was only alright. The steaks were really good, but I expected more for their prices. I could have eaten an equally delicious steak and asparagus somewhere else for half the price."}
{"text":"I was here for a business luncheon, and was very impressed by the quality of the food and the service. I had one of the lunch plate options, which included a creamy leak soup and steak hash. Delicious and full of flavor. The steak was perfectly grilled with a pink interior, and there was a great balance of steak to potato.  Will definitely be back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. The service excellent.  We ordered a Maker's Mark and the bourbon barely covered the bottom of the glass --disappointed  Otherwise a wonderful evening"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great burger in a great ambiance, look no further Capital Grille is your place! Centrally located in the heart of the city in the Biltmore, this burger joint is unlike any other.   Once you step foot into Capital Grill you already know that you are in beautiful decorated, and elegant establishment. The customer service is great starting with the greeter at the door, and the attentive waiters/waitresses staff. I constantly had my glass filled, as well as had a great breakdown of the beef (where it is from, what makes it so great, etc.) Additionally, the wines offered are smooth and vary in style but can be sampled.   The wine/burger combo is definitely a great promotion when available. Capital Grille is definitely great for a date night out, business meeting, or pretty much just for a great burger! Definitely one of the best burgers I have had to date."}
{"text":"This is our family's go-to favorite restaurant for special occasions, which is what we had this last visit, plus AZ Restaurant Week. Capital Grille's restaurant week menu was one of the best in the area. This restaurant is has great ambiance and the food is always exceptional. The front desk staff goes out of their way to make us feel welcome, as does the Managing Partner, Brian. My only observation over the past couple of years is that the service always starts out with a bang and then becomes rather average, which surprises me. All in all, it is very inconsistent. On our latest visit the restaurant was jammed due to restaurant week, but during the summer when there were not so many diners, the same impression regarding the service was true."}
{"text":"If you want to be treated like a queen or king...then bow down here. First, service is exceptional. They must have something in their computers cause every time we go they actually remember us...  Its pricey...but great places like this should be. And believe me, its money well spent. best steaks, appetizers, salads, deserts....why go further. Just make a reservation, dress nice and have a taste bud treat!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome! Great service and amazing food. I loved their green beans and fries."}
{"text":"Such a great date night!  Once we arrived our jackets were taken and we were quickly taken to our reserved booth. (Thanks to the FREE Open Table Android App)   Our server Melissa S was great! We told her that we were celebrating a late Valentine's Day and she brought us each a complimentary Champagne Toast. We both had the Adults Only Arnold Palmer as our cocktails. The bread basket featured some really tasty bread to hold us over until our salads came out.   We shared a delicious blue cheese and bacon wedge salad. The Applewood smoked bacon really made the salad. I just wish it had a little more blue cheese in the dressing.   The wife had the Dry Aged Steak au Poivre (Tender sirloin flavored with black peppercorn) with a side of creamed spinach and I had the Dry Aged Porterhouse with a side Lobster Mac & Cheese. They were both superb! My Porterhouse was cooked perfectly and was extremely tender and juicy. The mac & cheese was delicious and had a good bit of Lobster as well. We both shared the mac & cheese and creamed spinach. The creamed spinach is blended with a béchamel sauce which is good but, a little too salty for my taste.  For dessert we had the Chocolate Hazelnut Cake. So good.  The place was pretty packed our entire evening there but, our service never suffered. Our glasses were always full and when finished our plates were also whisked away quickly and without any fuss. Even the valet guys are nice. I'm having my yummy leftovers for lunch as we speak. I couldn't have asked for a better evening!"}
{"text":"Great food and outstanding service. Had the Mediterranean salad and was one of the best I've had. Great place for a business lunch."}
{"text":"It's not normally like me to eat at a steak house, or a chain at that, and it's certainly not like me to give a chain steakhouse a 5 star rating.  But I definitely tip my cap to Cap Grille.  It's obvious why Consumer Reports rated it the #1 chain in the country.  Sure it's expensive, but the quality of the service and food is superb.  I had met someone there for a \"business\" lunch so we were both wearing black slacks - immediately after being seated the host handed us black napkins so that we wouldn't get any white fuzz on our slacks. (Brilliant!) The waiter was very friendly and described all of the options for us in great detail.  We started with the calamari which was outstanding - it blew me away that seafood could be so good in the desert (it had probably come in on the same flight I did from Boston)!  We both had 10oz sirloin steaks encrusted in ground decaf Kona coffee with a butter sauce.  Exquisite.  The waiter and bus boys were very attentive the whole meal.    I didn't find cap grille to be pretentious at all.  I mean, all of the patrons wearing suits and it cost us $60pp incl tax and tip for an app, an entree, and a drink.  So if that is pretentious (and people seem to think that is what makes a place pretentious) then fine.  But I didn't find anyone to be super snotty or rude - the service was impeccable.   I would definitely go back here or to any other location, but only for an extra special occasion or if I can claim it as a business expense and get reimbursed!"}
{"text":"Great food, service, setting and views. Even the bread basket has several offerings. Prices are in-line with other great restaurants and food!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service! Perfect for a special occasion. The lobster mac-n-cheese is phenomenal. We'll be back for birthdays, anniversaries, and whenever we're just in the mood for a really great steak!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's relatively new (10 years?), but has a traditional steakhouse ambiance. It's a chain, but honors this town through its presidential portrait - inspired paintings of influential Nevadans and visitors to Las Vegas (Helen Stewart, Sarah Winnemucca and the Rat Pack, Howard Hughes, respectively). The service is top notch, impressive even to Las Vegas residents who are accustomed to a certain level of treatment. The food was wonderful - I loved my steak with the truffle crust and blue cheese topping, but next time will order a plain steak; I'm sure they'll do it \"right\" and it will shine without all the other flavors. Really nice personal touches, like learning our names and the little thank you note from the chef tied to the doggy bag."}
{"text":"A-MAZE-ING. Went here for my husband's birthday... Table was decorated with confetti and had a hand-written birthday card addressed to him.  Service was impeccable and food was delicious.  We had a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"O. M. G....this restaurant is amazing! My husband and I came here for our one year anniversary and  the Capital Grill went above and beyond to make our night special...  Service: the service is impeccable. The attention to detail was amazing. Our server was Jeff Spivey. I can't say enough good things about him. He went out of his way to make our night magical. He's amazing!! The entire capital grill team goes above and beyond for special occasions. They gave us complimentary champagne, decorated the table with hearts, gave us a hand written anniversary note, and complimentary dessert. It was beautiful!  Food: omggggg the food is amazing!!!! We got the Delmonico steak (now called the ribeye) and the lobster mac and cheese. The steak was one of the best I have ever had! It was so flavorful and juicy! The mac and cheese was out of this world! It had huge chunks of lobster and the cheese was so creamy!   My husband and I loved this place so much that we have decided to make this our annual anniversary restaurant! Thank you so much Capital Grill!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I REAAAALY wanted to have one of the best steaks in a while, but it just wasn't that great.  I'd give the food 4 stars at best, but the price was utterly ridiculous.  It was quite a busy night when I walked in this dimly lit restaurant with very prestigious decor.  We had reservations and were seated immediately.  We walked right past the local banking community at the bar.  The service was awesome, very attentive, but not quite stalking.  I felt I was splurging enough, so laid off the booze, but pretty credible wine selection.  The onion loaf bread was great.  Me and my date each had different salads, I had the Cesar which had mediocre quality Parmesan shavings on top.  The other was a basic chef's with a champagne vinaigrette.  Was good, nothing to write home about.  Then came the steaks.  We both ordered medium rare(as YOU should)  The tournedos with morel crust were raw in the middle but still pretty tasty.  Very subtle on the morel.  My kona rubbed sirloin was a little past medium.  $42 steak that wasn't even cooked right, WOW!  Decent flavor, but I could easily cook a better steak with a good beef an iron skillet and above average salt.  The sides lacked luster.  Just had some potatoes and greens.  Then came desert, SO GOOD.  We had a cheesecake and a flan of sorts.  Both were amazing.  They were pretty much the only reason that I didn't complain about the meal.  All in all, it was restaurant week and I know they just push people through, but I was thoroughly disappointed."}
{"text":"Had a bday dinner here with 9 of my friends.  Great experience and food was very good. We all ordered steak(different selections) and all were cook to order, which is impressive...10 steaks to all come out at the same time. We all order different appetizers lobster Mac, potatoes, French onion soup were all good nothing mind blowing but the  Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarella was very good.  But the service I'd give 5 stars.  Our server Chad(I think(hope)was his name was awesome. Just attentive enough, friendly, funny and very helpful.  The rest of the servers we're also spot on the whole night.... Waters were kept full, napkins were quickly refolding if anyone left the table. They brought my a card that had wished me a happy birthday and complementary dessert and Chad got hold table to sing me happy birthday. Good solid steakhouse I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I took my family here for Charlotte's Restaurant Week the other night to celebrate my dad's birthday. There were 5 of us. Let me just say, it was incredible. I've done the Restaurant Week thing before on numerous occasions and, it's very easy to come across servers and restaurants that are focused on getting you in and out as quickly as possible. This was absolutely not the case here.  Being that it was Restaurant Week, there was a set menu for us to choose from. Unfortunately, there was not a vegetarian option (my fiancee is vegetarian), however the server spoke with the chef and they were able to come up with an incredible vegetarian pasta that she loved. The server was very conscious to avoid any soups that had a meat broth as well. In addition, at no point were any of our water glasses ever empty, every interaction with the server was met with a smile, and what's more important, we never felt rushed. The server found out that it was my dad's birthday, and brought him a cheesecake with a candle for dessert (complementary).   As for the food, I can say that this was without a doubt the best steak I've ever had. The filet was so tender and cooked perfectly! For some perspective, I've eaten at Ruth's Chris, Del Friscos, and several other high-end steakhouses in addition to working at a very high-end country club. Capital Grille blew all of them out of the water.   I truly can't say enough about our experience. My dad said that it was the best birthday he'd had in a very long time, and attributed it to his experience at Capital Grille. If you are looking for a great place to eat, with great service, I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Love this place. I had the citrus salmon was Delish! I would recommend coming here again."}
{"text":"Absolute perfection! I have been to many steakhouses and this one ranks in the top three. I ordered the Delmonico steak cooked medium. It was tender and very delicious! My GF got the Kona steak and said it was amazing as well. The service is great. Our server Nicole was amazingly warm and very knowledgeable. She recommended the Delmonico to me and I appreciated it. Go here for a good dinner, nice atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"It's simple, really. If you want great food, ambiance and service - guaranteed, go to The Capital Grille. Sit at the bar, have Juan treat you like you deserve to be treated and enjoy the experience.  Great food, ambiance and service."}
{"text":"Despite an initial service hiccup, the staff at Capital Grille more than compensated for this upon learning of our wait. Service thereafter was seamless, high-touch - special kudos to certified trainer Michelle Underwood (?)  Ranked in order of recommendation:  24 oz. Dry-Aged Porterhouse - perfectly medium rare. 3 of us enjoyed this equally much. Lobster/Crab-stuffed Shrimp - this was a beautiful entree but too rich, would strongly recommend sharing. Spinach salad w/warm bacon dressing, onions, mushrooms - delicious. Lobster mac - found this too crunchy - heavily crusted (not light as panko typically might suggest), has a few lobster lump pieces.  Generous wine list with a wide range of tastes and price points is a plus."}
{"text":"All I really have to say is...this place is AMAZING. Classic ambiance, Delicious food, fantastic service, potent wine and dreamy dessert. The food at the capital grill is well worth the price.   I ordered the balsamic wagyu burger. It was heavenly. I decided to have it served medium and this was the perfect choice.  It was so savory and juicy. I also elected to have the truffle oil fries. OH MY GOD. I think they were the best fries I've ever had in my entire life. For dessert, I ordered the cheesecake. The cook fired the top to give it a small crunch. I'm not a huge dessert fan, so I don't think I really appreciated the time it took to create such a beautiful dish, so I'll include a photograph.   I don't think I've ever been in a restaurant that has made me want to come back the very next day, so props to the capital grill!"}
{"text":"my wife and i decide to celebrate our 7th aniversariy having a nice dinner so after shooping at the mall we went to the capital grille, and a hostest who was on the phone tellus to wait for our table, after 7  to 10 minutes i askher if we can go to take a drink at the bar in the mean time, so she just point the way to the bar, we ordered a cuple of glasses of champagne, and after 2 glasses we finaly get our table, rigth on the window, facing las vegas boulevard, super nice view, so one waiter named francisco, come and great us and askus if we were ready to order, but a that time we didint look the menus yet so i askhim about cheffs specials and he toldme  thay are sold out, so im ordered the calamari apetizer, soo   gooooood, the spicy chilis what they put on them make them realy spicy and delicius, i get the porcini rub rib eye, and my wife the coffe steak, the food was exclelent, but im was tryng to surprise my wife with a nice bottle of red wine and the server never show up with the wine list again, because im iskhim to check the real wine list, the expensive one, so when we almost were finish he come back and give me the wine list, a little vit late, because i was finish whit my steak but i still take a look, great seleccion, if i will get that a little bit early i will get at list one of thee opus one of theyr list but its ok nex time at list i know they have on so we order desert  the cococnut pie, so rich and sweet so we going to come back at list for desert"}
{"text":"So disappointed in our meal. Not sure if they have new chef or cooking staff, but every part of our meal was bad. Shrimp Cocktail - shrimp totally over cooked & hard. Shaved Brussel Sprouts salad - chewy. Filet Mignon (medium cook)- burnt on the outside. Scallops - Porcini rub recommended, but it was so salty. Scallops were sandy too. For $200+ -totally dissatisfied. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"We went Saturday night and had an amazing Ribeye, Porterhouse, Lobster Mac and Cheese, and side of asparagus. Everything was perfectly cooked, service was beyond fantastic. Great dinner and we look forward to our next meal here. We have been to this location approximately 10 times in the last few years and each visit is the same great experience. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Always like the food here. If you're in the area the capital Grille has great steaks but you will pay for it so be prepared. Always go hungry and treat yourself once in a while"}
{"text":"The bone in filet off the menu is the absolute best! The truffle fries are second to none.  Probably one of the top burgers, maybe only second to JG Melon in NYC.  The service is always top notch.  We prefer the bar to the main dinning room."}
{"text":"Food was good, but not blown away by the taste. Somewhat overpriced. Service was so-so. Ambiance is decent."}
{"text":"My mouth is watering just thinking of the Capital Grille in Charlotte. I don't get to come here that often considering the price tag, but when I do, it's always nothing short of super fantastic. This particular Capital Grille is very classy from the service to decor to the selections of food and wine. The staff is very attentive, professional and informative. The food is insanely delicious and could feed you for days on end!   Capital Grille, hands down, receives my Best Cheesecake in Charlotte award! I usually describe their cheesecake as this: \"It's a NY cheesecake, with a cookie dough-like crust instead of a graham cracker crust, and with a creme-brulee sugar-flambeed topping.\" It's freakin' unbelievable! I would get just that cheesecake to-go on a random night if I ever wanted to!   But I digress... They also have a nice patio on the sidewalk of Tryon and 5th St. if you fancy people-watching while you enjoy a 4 course meal. They've also just added a lunch bites menu that is for those who need to eat and run at a much smaller price than their usual dinner fare.  Capital Grille is just the place to go if you're looking to impress business clients, for a classy date night or for a special occasion with family or friends. Make a reservation and be prepared to eat/drink like royalty and drop money like you're makin' it rain!"}
{"text":"Awesome location with incredible strip views! We've been here many times & always order the same thing because it's our little tradition and bottom line absolutely delicious! The porcini rubbed delmonico  steak is phenomenal, the lobster mac & cheese is creamy goodness & we love this place for these two things on the menu.  I also enjoy the little special touches for our special occasions like complimentary champagne for V Day or dessert for any special occasions. They decorate your table & hand write you a card, it's always appreciated.  Everything on the menu is great & the ambiance is perfect for a classy steak house."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. My husband and I frequented this place 1-2x a week and often ate at the bar. Ask for Paul the bartender-he is very competent, but also entertaining. He treated us very well, and always remembers your name.   I am a fan of the food. It is quality. I especially like the lobster mac and cheese. Despite its priceness, it is worth it. I am from Boston, and have been to Maine many times, so you can't expect to get cheap lobster in Charlotte, NC. The steaks are good-to be expected, but I was surprised at how delicious the cheeseburger was. I am a big cheeseburger fanatic and the meat is very supple and quality. The added sauces you can dip or put on the burger are a huge bonus.   The capital grille is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"As usual, another great experience.  The special of the night was a tomahawk veal chop.  Outstanding!  Since a special occasion, added the lobster tail.  Again-outstanding.  $100 for this combination, but it was a birthday celebration so we celebrated.  Only disappointment was the valet parking which previously was complimentary is now $8.  Not sure if that was all for the employee parking the car so I handed her a $10 and said thank you.  Management might want to rethink this decision.  We spent over $325 for my wife and I.  Not too much to expect free parking!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to come here and first time trying it out and I was impressed!  First and foremost, the hostess greeted us right away.  She was very friendly.  Restaurant was very nice inside, nice view of the Las Vegas Strip.  We first started with apps which we had oysters, lobster and calamari and shrimp.  All was very good!! Oysters were nice and cold and being in Las Vegas surprisingly; tasted fresh.  Lobster was served cold but it was very tasty. The calamari was pretty good.  It defiantly had a some kick to it due to the  peperoncini and peppers mixed it. And the shrimp were huge; could use a little more cocktail sauce but the apps were great!  Now on to my entree all I have to say was YUMM!!!  I ordered the sea bass and it was awesome!!! It was cooked perfectly, tasted great.  I would highly recommend this entree.  My boyfriend ordered the steak and lobster and he said that it was just the right amount of food due to if you order some of the steaks they are huge! His steak was cooked perfectly; just the way he liked it and the lobster was on top with some creamy sauce as the base.    Our sides were corn, Au gratin potatoes and lobster mac-n-cheese and asparagus.  The sides were good I just have to say if you order the corn, Au Gratin Potatoes and the loster mac-n-cheese, it's all based with cream sauce and bread crumbs.  I've heard from several people that the lobster mac-n-cheese was very good but I wouldn't rate it as a 5.  It was alright.  I expected it to be a little more cheesy and the noodles could of been more of the traditional way to where the cheese can get inside of the noodles instead of using a egg noodles.  All in all, I will definately go there again!!!"}
{"text":"I came to Capital Grille to celebrate an anniversary with my boyfriend and it was such a pleasant experience.   Our server was Maria and she was AMAZING. She was very attentive and she was so sweet, making our experience a great one.   For an appetizer we decided on the calamari. Maybe it was the jalapeños, but the dish tasted like nachos. LOL. Not like it was a bad thing, it just caught me by surprise. It's pretty spicy, so if you're not a fan of spice, this is your warning.   For my entree, I got the Kona crusted NY Strip. It was MASSIVE. But so delectable. It was a melt-in-your-mouth kind of steak, but unfortunately I wasn't able to finish it because it was so big. :( but it tasted even greater the next day for lunch LOL.   Along with the entrees, my boyfriend and I shared the lobster mac 'n' cheese as a side. SO SO CREAMY, and they were not greedy with the lobster. All the sides are more than big enough for two, so plan accordingly. ¯\_(?)_/¯   For a cocktail, I decided on the House Cosmo--sweet and tangy, just like how I like it. :)   I see myself coming to Capital Grille for all my special occasion dinners."}
{"text":"what a great experience. my son is in the navy and has been for 4 years now.  we had not scene him in almost 2 years and wanted to not only be with him but to take him out for a nice dinner. i heard many good things about the capital grille so we decided to take him there.  beside for myself and my partner, there was my son, my daughter and 2 friends.  we had just picked my son up at the airport and seeing my son come off that plane and seeing my son in his navy clothes made me tear up because i was so proud of him.  my son was shocked that we were taking him to dinner at the capital grille.  when we arrived there, we only had to wait a couple minutes to be seated so make sure that you make a reservation.    the manager had come to our table and asked how we where doing which was very nice.  he said that there was a guest of theres that would like us to have a drink on that person and thanking my son for his service to our country.  that was so cool of that person.  i told our waiter that this was a special occasion after not seeing my son for so long and if she would come to our table with 4-5 different appitizers which she did.  she came with 2 orders of prsciutto wrapped mozzarella, lobster and crab cakes, fresh mozzareliia/tomato/ basi, calamari, and fresh oysters on the half shell.  our waiter even asked if there was anything else and we added 3 orders of chopped salad which we all split among us all and a couple of us ordered the lobster bisc soup and that was really good.  we all ordered steaks.  we ordered the aged porterhuse steak, fillet mignon, and delmonico steak.  we had lobster and cheese mac, green beans, and creamed spinich.  we all had the berries and ice cream for desert.  we also have some leftovers and even the leftovers were great the next day.  the manager had come back to our table when we were almost finished and asked if we enjoyed our meal.  it was all positive comments.  he thanked us for coming and and he thanked my son for his service,  that made me very proud.  our waitrer then brought us our bill and it said paid.  i asked the waiter that i thought there was a problem with the bill and she said that the manager had taken care of this and told me that it was their pleasure to take care of this and thanked me for my sons service.    not only was this a fantastic meal, this had to have been a $800 dollar tab and for them to do that was a great jesture on their part.  the waiter was taken care of very nicely.  thank you capital grille for everything!"}
{"text":"This place was definitely worth the wait!   I met some girlfriends for Restaurant Week. It's always super busy bit with our early evening reservations we didn't feel rushed through our meal at all.   The service and wine selections were phenomenal. Our glasses were always full, we didn't ever have to ask for anything and  our waitress offered excellent wine pairing selections with our dinner.   For my meal I ordered the Caesar salad, filet cooked medium well and creme brûlée cheesecake for dessert.   The salad was just average. Nothing really special but the steak and cheesecake were absolutely fantastic. The steak was cooked perfectly and so tender!!! I enjoyed every single bite. And the creme brûlée topping in the cheesecake was a nice spin on such a classic dessert.   I'd absolutely go again."}
{"text":"I'm going to be honest I was nervous about coming here because of the reviews. Me and my husband made reservations for our anniversary celebration. Everyone here treated us nice. They had our table ready with decorations and we even got a card saying happy anniversary. Also gave us some roses which were beautiful and dessert, wine. They literally spoiled us! You guys have to try this place out. I will definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend during the height of the G-20 Conference in September 2009 as we could not find another restaurant OPEN.   Jessica, our server, was fantastic.  She was helpful and prompt and I get the feeling that she would be that way regardless of the number of tables  in her charge for the evening.   The food was excellent, as can be expected, but pricey, as should be expected.  When the time came for after dinner beverages, we chose scotch.  My selection was nearly out, partial pour, so they gave it to me on the house, a nice touch.   Everything we ordered was cooked to perfection, piping hot and delicious."}
{"text":"This is an excellent steak house for the price.  It is more a medium priced place for a steak house.  2 people with sides, desert, and an app will cost about $200. We have always received great service and good food.  Came her for my wife's birthday and they had decorations set out on the table and made it extra special.  Will definitely be returning.  If you request it you can get a table by the window overlooking the strip.  Great view during the evening hours.  Only downfall is it is located at the fashion show mall.  They offer valet but during busy hours it get full.  You can park in the parking garages but it is quite a walk.  Makes it nice after dinner because you can walk your meal off a little.  Even with the parking it will not stop us from coming back."}
{"text":"This is our go to restaurant whenever we are in Vegas, and need a Top Notch place to take clients. They deliver every time!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals of my life.  Appetizer of oysters and a glass of cabernet.  Kona coffee rubbed steak, cooked perfectly, with a side of lobster mac and cheese and creamed spinach.  Finished with another glass of cabernet and a flourless chocolate espresso cake.  It gets no better."}
{"text":"I always find it funny how chain steakhouses go through the pomp and circumstance of \"explaining the menu.\"  Yes, it's a la carte.  Yes, I know we'll have to split some sides.  Yes, I know I can get my steak with some clever sauce on it.  That said, good place.  Eight of us went here.  Not cheap...two cocktails, a great steak, sides, and starters, and it ended up being about a hundred a head, but we were stuffed.  The lobster mac and cheese was a little scary but was actually quite good.  The steaks were big and the cocktails were too.  Friendly waiter, and a nice view of the strip.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"Amazing place!! Love it! The food is delicious. They have one of the best steaks ever!! And they were so nice! Definitely going back with the hubs!"}
{"text":"This is the classic Capital Grille experience.  And that is a classy, high-end one at that.  The product here is very similar to other Capital Grille's, so I will not go into detail.  The point I was wanting to make here is that I happened to be out with a co-worker who is a very experienced bar man who's also a bit of a foodie and really enjoys a good restaurant.  So, being a classy place, he started ordering some really traditional drinks that you just don't hear of much these days.  The bartender at this Capital Grille was definitely up to the measure required for CG staff and the high-end product they deliver.  A couple drinks we had made are a Baby Guiness (which I had never heard of myself).  Barman knew exactly what to do, even the pour over the back of a spoon.  Another was Sambuca, which was expertly paired with 3 coffee beans.  The guy knew what he was doing.  And it was done smartly.  Capital Grille - always a good fine dining experience."}
{"text":"This was a special event that we were looking forward to for a few weeks. One week prior, i went online to change our reservation from 6 to 6:30. I received s confirmation email immediately. When we showed up right around  6:30 the hostess (talker one with long get hair) copped an attitude telling me that our reservation was for 6. I showed her the confirmation for 6:30, which she begrudgingly agreed but qualified that i \"must have changed it on the web...\".  That was a bad way to start out out celebration dinner.  I told the maitre he graciously apologized.   Maria was our very attentive server and the team supporting her was well coordinated.  Except for the rude greeter, everyone used appropriate \"Ritz Carlton\" language and backed it up with very good service.  Oh, the food, Well it was top shelf."}
{"text":"I went there this past Saturday night in a party of seven that included two kids (12 and 14). I did not know that they had valet parking as that would have been very useful on a busy uptown Saturday night. Anyway, seating was very prompt as we had a reservation.  I was dressed up quite nicely but most of my party were casually dressed and no one felt uncomfortable. They do have a dress code but I understand that they are lenient.  The service was just so impeccable! Prompt but not intrusive, attentive, courteous, friendly but not overly so, just top notch.  Sorry I forgot our waitress name but she was very helpful in explaining the dishes so that even the kids could understand. Well the food was just outstanding also. We ordered a lot of appetizers to share and all of them were  delightful.  Special mention; the Pan Fried Calamari with hot peppers ( that sure didn't last long!), the creamy  Mashed  potatoes (the best I've ever had), the Lobster and Crab Cakes and the Lobster Mac'N' Cheese (just divinely delicious!). We also had various vegetable sides but I didn't sample many of those.  For the main courses, all the adults had different steaks on the menu. Mine was the Steak au Poivre with a creamy French sounding sauce. It was beautifully tender at medium rare and spiced just right. Everyone raved about their steaks. The kids had their Chicken tenders (?) which was not on the regular menu but the waitress arranged it. The ambience was classy but not stuffy. We were not loud but pretty chatty and never felt rushed or uncomfortable. The vibe was bustling but relaxed for the guests. Only one person had dessert, everyone else were too full. The bill ( which I didn't see fortunately, thanks bro!) must have been quite high but it was well worth it.  Everyone was happy, no complaints of any kind. Would absolutely go again on special occasions."}
{"text":"This place was two thumbs down. =( It's crazy expensive for really nothing special.  ugh, what a waist. I had the shrimp caesar salad and it would have been good except they drowned my lettuce in the dressing. I think they charged me $20 for it with only four shrimps... Are you kidding me? I don't remember what the two people I was with ordered but they were not satisfied at all.  Still hungry is what they were with the extremely small portions they were served.  For what they charge at this place you should be able to leave full and completely satisfied and WE DID NOT. The waiter was nice but in an annoying way and her uniform was three sizes to big for her, sorry it was annoying me.  When we went it was quiet because the place was practically empty. Whatever you live and learn. Won't ever visit the Capital Grill again. =:("}
{"text":"Service was great! Went there for weekday lunch.  Got the spinach bacon salad as my side and that could have been my whole meal.  Got the ribeye sandwich as my main course and that was scrumptious.  My BF got the swordfish and mashed potatoes.  I don't like fish but he said it was yummy.  The mashed potatoes were some of the best I've ever had.  My sandwich was even good leftover.  Will most certainly frequent this spot!"}
{"text":"The cheesecake was fabulous.  The customer service was lacking and the Seared Tuna was the worst I had ever had."}
{"text":"With a plethora of steakhouses all over the city it can be difficult to be among the top but this place does it.  It does it for a few reasons, the service is phenomenal, the food is fantastic, and the ambiance is classic yet cozy.    The steaks I have had here are different than your typical steakhouse which is what appeals to me.  The rubs and sauces are what truly differentiate this place from a majority of the others, not to mention my steak has been cooked perfectly here as opposed to many of the others (it shouldn't be a difficult process to cook a medium and not bring me a rare) .  Porcini rubbed Delmonico with aged balsamic was delicious and I recommend it as well as the lobster mac n cheese.  If you have the luck to get seated at a table where Tom is waiting on you than you have lucked out."}
{"text":"We had the best time at the Capital Grille.  We were seated in a very cozy table and enjoyed the martini and seafood platter we got.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance of this restaurant. The buzz. It's like a little bit of New York and Paris have arrived in Phoenix! The service is excellent and the food exquisite. We were a party of 5 and choose Lobster Bisque, Calamari, Fishcakes and Wedge Salad to begin. 3 of the party had steak and it was wonderful. I had the tuna. It was cooked to perfection seared on the outside and rare inside. So tender and delicious. The selection of wines are excellent and we started with the Riesling and continued with red. It is pricey. It is an expensive night out but if watching the cents is the least of your problems then you are in for a treat. Definitely a safe bet for any food snob or connoisseur!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty top notch! Complimentary valet parking make life easier when eating downtown. The atmosphere was great in the restaurant, busy for a Monday night when we went, so I found it a little loud. The food was great I had the sirloin,  43.00 dollars though was a little high for just a steak. The wine list was extremely long but the servers are well educated on it! We shared cheesecake for dessert and it was to die for. Overall very nice night out, however pricey for what it is."}
{"text":"Always fantastic food always fantastic service.  Travis is a Fantastic Chef, and Brian and Bo are fantastic managers who always make you feel like your the most important people in the place.  This is my favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"This is by far our favorite steakhouse, and our go to spot for special occasions!! We always ask for Terry, he is a fantastic server and always makes us feel like part of his family!! The food is great, the atmosphere is romantic and the staff is amazing!!!! Steaks are always cooked to perfection, and our glasses are never empty. The lobster bisque is the perfect way to start the meal, it's not on the menu, but they always have it!!"}
{"text":"We're from out of town and  came here thinkiing it was your typical grill type restrauant.  We realize right away when we entered and saw the decor that we had made a mistake.  So much for not noticing the dollar signs on Yelp.  However we made the best of the situation.  We skipped drinks and dessert.  The main entrees were delicious.  The service was amazing!  They were so attentive.  If we ever have a special occasion, this is a place we will choose."}
{"text":"You've got to come here during Restaurant Week to score a deal. Otherwise, it can get pretty expensive here. Came here for lunch during Restaurant Week and the deal was such a steal. For $16, you get a three course meal.    I thoroughly enjoyed my meal which consisted of a wedge salad, a sirloin, and a flourless chocolate espresso cake. Honestly, no complaints with the meal whatsoever. The salad was...well it's salad. The sirloin was well-seasoned and cooked exactly as ordered. And the cake was amazing, which I must say, the name is a little misleading. It's more like a cream or a fudge than a cake. However, was it the best meal I've had? I've had better. I feel that to get the best out of The Capital Grille, I would need to order the filet at dinner time.   I would definitely come back here again but I will probably wait for Restaurant Week to avoid paying full price. Yes, I am that cheap! Otherwise, the food is good and the dining experience here is nice!"}
{"text":"Great fish. We had the swordfish and halibut. Hubby said it was the best swordfish he's had in a long while. The halibut was good. The crab and lobster cake was made with panko flakes. If they had browned it a bit longer, it would have been good; the crab and lobster chunks were sweet, but the filling was mushy.  Our table mates enjoyed their steaks.  The wine was good. The service was surprisingly average."}
{"text":"First off, let me tell you if you haven't been to Capital Grille, you need to go! This is by far the best dining experience I have ever had.  I went to the one in Chicago twice and this was my first time in Pittsburgh and they were all exceptional.  Positives:   Staff is amazing they make you feel as if you are the owner of Capital Grille, they really know how to treat the customer.  They are always on top of drinks, refills, and making sure you are taken care of.  Food:  Amazing, amazing, amazing, PERIOD!  Negatives: None  Overall:  I have been to Morton's, I have been to Hyde Park, but nothing compares to The Capital Grille, it is worth the money.  I will always be a loyal customer of Capital Grille for always making my experience great."}
{"text":"We visited during a recent trip to Charlotte and attended for an anniversary dinner.  Before we continue, our dinner came to just over $200, so for that Im going to be EXTRA critical.    The pros: - Service was outstanding. We couldn't take a sip of water without it being refilled. Everyone was extra cordial, the table was available earlier than our reservation, food came out very timely and on point, drink selections were well received, they even made sure to tell wait staff if was our anniversary, many of whom thereafter gave us good wishes.  The cons: - The steak was *very* good, but I've had better.  My wife got a filet that she found to be very tender and enjoyable, but it wasn't a cut above anything she's had at other top steak restaurants.  I got the Kona enfused dry aged NY strip, and I found the flavor to be too much - the coffee added an unnecessary bitterness to the steak, I wish I went for straight-up steak, as there shouldn't be a need to \"mask\" its natural flavors/  I would definitely go to TCG again, and we enjoyed our meal.. but we didn't enjoy it on par with what we paid for our meal.  For that amount, I've been to Ruth's Chris a number of times, and I found the steak more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service.  The manager Kristen was awesome and so was our server Jeff. I highly recommend this restaurant for dinner."}
{"text":"Overpriced!  I've had just as good of filet mignon at Longhorn.  I guess I had a bad experience since we  got seated near a table with a bunch of roudy toddlers whos parents let them literally run around the table and almost bump into the waiters!   We should have moved!  For the price you pay, you want a nice, quite, enjoyable evening without hearing screaming kids!   Parents, leave your kids at home at a upscale restaurant!"}
{"text":"Was referred here by a friend, brought my wife here for our 20th anniversary and it was the perfect place. We made reservations and recommend you do the same, we walked in 5 min before our reservation and were promptly seated. We both opted for steak, mine was Kona crusted and was one of the best steaks I have had in a long time. Atmosphere was perfect, service was impeccable, definitely recommend.   Our waiter was Erik O'connell, he was well versed with all aspects of the restaurant which is a plus if you aren't great with wine pairings as their wine list is quite extensive."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVED this place. We ate here for our anniversary. We had a waiter named Eric and he was funny and entertaining. He gave us an iPad with all the drink specials. My boyfriend was boring and just got a crown and coke. I opted for their special stol-doli. It is pineapple infused vodka and they make it themselves. It was so smooth and good. Whenever I drink vodka, I usually cringe because I hate the taste of it. This drink was so smooth that you couldn't even taste the vodka! Its dangerous, I ended up having two without any thought haha For our appetizers we got a caesar salad and lobster bisque. The lobster bisque was so buttery and creamy and full of lobster chunks. I had ordered the salad but ended up taking the bisque from the boo lol Fo rmy main dish I got the tenderloin with lobster. It comes with two 4 ounce filet mignons and a lobster on top of each. It was very juicy and tender. Literally melt in your mouth. The boyfriend got the dry aged kona rubbed (im pretty sure I messed that up) bone in ribeye. IT WAS SOOOO GOOOD. We are cming back in two weeks just to eat this again. Yeah. It was that good. We also got the lobster mac and cheese which was so good. I am severely lactose intolerant so just imagine what I had to go through to eat this. But I ate most of it despite the consequences I would face later. lol. We had no room for dessert but we took the rest home. When you take it home, they attach this little card signed by the chef. My name is Sarah and my boyfriend's name is Rocco....the chef's name was SACCO! It was meant for us to eat here haha"}
{"text":"I had the porcini rubbed ribeye steak and it was unbelievable. The Capitol Grille is a steakhouse that has yet to disappoint me."}
{"text":"High quality in both service and food. How do they not have 5 stars? Some people are just too picky... I'd hate to see how they act at Chili's.   Anyway,  came here for a work lunch today and could not have been more impressed. The size of their shrimp for the shrimp cocktail was more than adequate,  they were fresh, and the cocktail sauce was deeelicious. Had the Mediterranean salad which I also thoroughly enjoyed. They were very generous with the servings of the chicken on top- it was hot, moist,  and sliced thin enough to be enhance the salad but not too thin where it was skimpy. Loved the pickled red peppers and heirloom tomatoes as a twist, too. Feta was fresh and the dressing was great.    Dessert: coconut cream pie and creme brulee. Both were fantastic. I don't normally like coconut, and I had 2 helpings!   Service: great, great, great, and even had a nice chat with the new manager.   Scottsdale location is closer, but I'd definitely like a \"next time\"... my husband's birthday is coming up!"}
{"text":"Just met the Capital Grille Chefs at Taste of Pepper Pike.  Hands down the best vendor here and there were many great ones.  The filet was so tender and slackening and the shallot butter sauce was to die for .  Definitely on our date night radar!"}
{"text":"We decided to celebrate my friend's birthday here & from the moment we walked in the door the hostesses were warm & welcoming. Our server, Lisa Marie, was adorable, friendly & knowledgeable. We each had a Stoli Doli (vodka infused with pineapple) Yum!!!  Since the 3 of us love to try different things we decided to order \"The Shareables\" and we loved all of our selections.   The? lobster Mac & cheese was awesome (best I've ever had & not too cheesy). The crab cakes with lobster were wonderful and loaded with chunks of lobster !!!  We also ordered creamed spinach, sautéed spinach & brussel sprouts.  We all loved everything.  Beautiful decor, wonderful service & delicious food -  I can't wait to return!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great fresh seafood platter, lobster mac and cheese, and lamb. Service is quite good.  Great for large groups also. I've been to a few holiday parties there. Always good food. Nice view of the strip."}
{"text":"the filet is always my go to at any steak house. but this filet melted in my mouth. they offer many sauce choices but I just prefer mine plain because it is so juicy by itself.  the service is top knotch. it was the perfect dinner for my vegas weekend."}
{"text":"5 stars for service, 4 stars for food and price, depending on what you order.  My husband and I were able to come in for their soft opening, which was a fantastic dining experience.  Our appetizers were the French onion soup and a spinach salad with bacon dressing. These were delicious, especially the French onion. Our entrees consisted of dry-aged bone-in tenderloin (phenomenal and one of the best I've ever tasted - well worth the $50) and pan-seared sea scallops. The portions are gigantic for a fancy restaurant (so well done), but I'd say I prefer if I had 3 gigantic scallops as opposed to several medium-sized ones, even for the price of $43.  The dish was tasty but these scallops were probably not as fresh as other seafood restaurants. I'd say this restaurant is a definite steakhouse. We also had the lobster Mac n' cheese side, which was very good, well cooked, had a good mix of lobster and nicely portioned.  For dessert, we had mixed berries, which was a nice way to finish our large dinner.  The freshly made lemonade with mint and freshly infused pineapple vodka cocktail were delicious.  I would order these again in a heartbeat.   Lastly, the service was excellent, so that and the dry-aged tenderloin is what I'd truly come back for.  OK decor and awesome wine display.  Our bill with tip would have come out to be around $220, though, so just a warning."}
{"text":"I. LOVE. CAPITAL. GRILLE.  I typically try and stray away from chain restaurants, especially ones I consider to be 'over-priced'. But this place is different. The staff is uber friendly and accommodating, and they have almost anything you'd desire to eat... all the way from soups, to burgers, to chicken, to various seafood entrees.   Appetizers: 10/10 would order the fried Calamari every time. Delicious, and with an added bonus of cherry & banana peppers thrown in.   Their lobster bisque is divine ... a must before each meal. Come hungry, or don't come at all.  Entrees: Their fish of the day is usually always a good call. For menu items, I love the Chilean Sea Bass, as well as the Seared Citrus Glazed Salmon. If you're looking for beef ... they use Wagyu beef and they're massive. The filet mignon is seared to perfection.     Dessert: All are made in house --- so you know they're made with love! The cheesecake with fresh berries in some of my favorite cheesecake, and the flourless chocolate espresso cake is heavenly.  From what I've seen, you can't go wrong with anything at this fine-dining establishment!"}
{"text":"I don't know where to start.  No.1 Randee Potter was by far the best waitress I have ever encountered. I can it say enough about her because it does no justice.  My girlfriend took me there for my birthday and the moment we walked in, the whole vibe was great. Jazz music with a nice setting.  Known for its seafood and steaks, ordered the only chicken plate (lol) and it was GOOD.  Then Randee brought put this cheesecake.... it was perfection with vanilla wafer crust... VANILLA WAFER CRUST!!!! I had to order another one to go.  All tjat being said. Randee Potter was the absolute best waitress. I cannot say that enough  And if she has a chance to read this, Thank you for the incredible experience"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here about a week after getting married. We had received a gift card and were excited to use it. We made our reservation for 8:00 because we had tickets to Zumanity at 10:00 thinking 2 hours would be enough time. We arrived on time at 8:00 and were informed that they were running about 10-15 minutes behind. We were asked to sit at the bar. Fine. We went and stood because there were no seats anywhere.   We were proceeded to be ignored by bartenders for at least 10 minutes before my husband got a Jack and ginger and I got a cranberry vodka. Not rocket science to make those drinks. So we were thinking that we'd get our table soon after. Not so. We waited another 20 minutes before being seated. One might expect that waiting 30 minutes for a table would mean we would get a nice table. Again not so. We were seated next to a two large loud groups. And by next to I mean if I stretched too much I would hit one of the ladies at the table next to me.   By the time we were seated, we were starving and knew what we wanted for appetizers but our server quickly disappeared and we did not see him for another 15 minutes. The only thing he did quickly was disappear.   It took us a full 2 hours to eat because the service was so slow. By the time we got out of there it was almost 11:00 and the mall the restaurant is located in was closed.   We missed our show and after attempts to reach management to discuss this experience to no avail, I promised that I would never ever return.   I cannot emphasize enough how horrible the service is here. DO NOT GO UNLESS YOU LIKE TO BE FRUSTRATED and wait."}
{"text":"We decided on Capital Grille for our anniversary dinner and I have to say this was one of the best dinners I've ever had.  We started with the lobster and crab cakes, which were served with a cold corn relish and house-made tarter sauce.  I appreciated the huge hunks of lobster in the cakes.  I had that night's special, which was a bone-in tenderloin.  That was the best steak I've ever eaten.  I paired it with the wine suggested by our waiter and the combo was incredible.  My husband had the porterhouse.  We also tried the lobster mac n cheese.  Amazing!!   I'm already looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Classy professional service from Megan!  She recommended the South African lobster and omg it was unreal.  She also treated myself and my girlfriend to a free dessert and a photo to take home!  Extremely well run place and well worth every cent. If you want to impress friends from out of town you have to bring them here !"}
{"text":"I went to \"The Capital Grille\" for my 21st birthday, years ago. I really enjoyed the views, environment, upscale dinning, and wonderful food!! I was able to spend my anniversary last week, here as well :) I actually booked my reservation through YELP! Which made it so easy. In the box I mention our celebration. Capital Grille went above and beyond with a letter from them, congratulating us. Also heart shaped decor was put on our table and free dessert for the occasion. The food was to die for! We ate till we couldn't anymore! :) Great people working there, from the waiters, to the bussers, and management! I'm sure if we met the kitchen, they'd be pretty awesome too! I'll be back sooner than later, that's for sure!!! Thanks for the wonderful experience and helping me celebrate my one year!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best steakhouses I've been to. While the prices are not cheap,  it is definitely worth it. If you order a steak and love crab try it oscar style. The steak is topped with crab and a decadent hollandaise sauce. If you love beets I'd recommend trying their beet salad with goat cheese. Simply delicious. You order your sides separately but they are all shareable. If you want a delicious meal with a great ambience go to capital grille, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian and was invited to a party at this restaurant. The veg. pasta was amazing and the appetizers and desserts were amazing!!! I can only imagine what the meat tasted like but everyone loved it."}
{"text":"omg, i went here for lunch, and it was so good! A little dim lighting for lunch, but it was delicious. Next time i will make sure to grab a drink too!"}
{"text":"This is my second 5 star in a row...and I don't give many.  My restaurant selections must getting better with age much like the 28 day dry aged steaks we had here last night!   I had the porterhouse and my wife the New York strip, both 28 day dry aged.  Without a doubt it was the best steak I have ever eaten.  Even better than the 40 day dry aged Himalayan sea salt ribeye steak I had at David Burke's in chitown.  No comparison really.   We had the calamari and roasted pepper appetizer and enjoyed it...could hardly eat it all.  Enjoyed our meal by splitting a yummy spinach salad topped with hot bacon dressing.  What a good night and good meal.  We were surprised with a \"first timer\" free dessert.  It was a two sided plate with a chocolate fudge-like delight on one side and a wonderful cheesecake fusion on the other...it was so good we even ate the 'words off the plate'...have to be there know this. Heart of the city which is nice and a wonderful decor and atmosphere.  Comp valet parking makes parking in the city a breeze!    Don't forget this place when you crave good food and especially steak!  They made our 20th anniversary dinner a wonderful night."}
{"text":"Maybe a steak restaurant wasn't the best choice for Turkey Day - pretty dry bird. Service was great though. BUT when I make a reservation a month in advance and request a window table, don't try to seat the 3 of us at a 2 top in a windowless private room that's otherwise occupied by a (loud) party of about 20. Nobody puts baby in the corner."}
{"text":"Food, service, and the view were excellent. It can seem very close in and crowded so if you're claustrophobic this may not be a great choice.   Other than that...this restaurant is on point. It's great for groups/parties and can also be a great romantic dining experience.   I had a chance to try the appetizer sampler. Amazing seafood!  I ordered the salmon, mashed potatoes, and lobster Mac n cheese. Also, all amazing!   And the excellent waiter recommended the Stoli Doli martini made from pineapple infused liquor was delish.   I recommend n def will return to try other menu items..."}
{"text":"The food is very good and the service is generally good too. The wine list, however, is misleading to the point of being fraudulent. They list wines with vintages and critic reviews in their iPad wine list but they substitute cheaper wines of newer vintages that do not have the same ratings. This happens consistently and the wait staff simply shrugs it off and says it's a corporate issue and they have no local control."}
{"text":"My Boss recommended this place if I was ever in Pheonix and it did not disappoint. The Food was excellent!!! Colette & Gabriels service was top notch,  wish they were in Hawaii!!!"}
{"text":"We came here for our anniversary. The service was excellent. Our waitress brought rose petals to the table and took the time to explain the menu. She recommended the Porcini Rubbed Delmonico with 12-Year Aged Balsamic. At first I thought, \"of course you would recommend the most expensive item on the menu, but what the heck. It's my anniversary!\" Let me tell you, it was the most phenomenal steak I've ever eaten. I'm talking melt-in-your-mouth delicious. On top of that - it was huge! We ordered crab cakes as an appetizer and they also had a very good flavor. She also brought out two complimentary desserts for us. The cheesecake was better than any other I've had. Rich, creamy, and perfect. The only \"downside\" is the price but if you're saving up for a special occasion then it's worth it. The price can very easily reach $100 per person but I haven't found better food anywhere else. I can't speak highly enough of how delicious this place is."}
{"text":"The staff is five stars all the way. Great rib eye steak with different types of rubs including coffee rub or a porcini mushroom and balsamic. Beautiful restaurant and extensive wine list... I had a pineapple infused martini which was sweet and smooth you could barley taste the Stoli Vodka. If you get a chance request Jamie for a server and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I would give the food a 4 star and the service seems to be slipping. The specials have some stipulations and never meet up with the sales pitch. The food is still very good and if you don't mind spending the money it is worth it."}
{"text":"Went back tonight, probably been here 10 times. My favorite steakhouse in Phoenix. Usually I have their porcini rubbed signature steak with balsamic, and sometimes the Filet Oscar. Tonight we did Alaskan King Crab legs, potatoes au gratin, lobster bisque, clam chowder, and crab/lobster cakes. OK, we shared, I ate most of it. Everything was fabulous, and the Crab legs were huge and sweet. Freakin Amazing. I know it's a chain restaurant, but the food is great and consistent, and the service is usually well above average. I always leave fat and happy."}
{"text":"Two words... Filet Mignon! My dinner was cooked to perfection, melt in your mouth like butter. The seasoning was on point and I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. We ordered sides for the table to share. Creamed Spinach was really good, I loved the flavor. The Brussels Sprout did not touch my plate but everyone else was raving about them so I can guess they were good. Fried calamari was pretty tasty as well. I have a few glasses of wine and was in heaven here.  The waitress was awesome, really friendly and efficient. She took everyone's order, it came out perfect. She definitely made it a better experience... which I love. The ambiance was nice and we really enjoyed ourselves.  This is a great date night place. I wouldn't bring my kids here for a regular dinner but date and dress up nights... YUP."}
{"text":"I made a reservation at Capital Grille to celebrate my friend's birthday. Although we arrived a few minutes early, we were seated immediately by a very gracious hostess who wished my friend a Happy Birthday on the way to our table.  The table itself was decorated with multi-colored shiny hearts and balloon shaped shiny ornaments. There was also a birthday card from the restaurant.  The restaurant itself is beautiful. It is all dark woods with classically set tables and highly trained wait staff.   We started with a shrimp cocktail and pan fried calamari with peppers. The shrimp were colossal sized and cooked (boiled or steamed) to perfection. They were extremely fresh and had the texture that can only be obtained from fresh shrimp. The calamari was one of the best dished that I have ever had and those who know me are aware that those words rarely come out of my mouth. Crunchy and crispy perfectly pan fried calamari in a mixture of various peppers. This dish is not for the faint of heart because it was spicy. But great spicy. The kind of spicy that makes you think it hurts so good.  For main courses we ordered the swordfish topped with a mixture of crab and a 22 ounce rib eye that was rubbed with porcini mushrooms. It was served mid rare exactly as ordered and was absolutely a culinary treat. I have had porcini before and of course I have eaten deliciously aged rib eyes but the combination of the two made for a memorable experience.  Capital Grille brought out a birthday dessert containing pieces of their famous creme brûlée style cheesecake and a chocolate cake. Cocktails were perfectly prepared and even the coffee was special.  This is a perfect place for a special occasion, a date or just a great meal. Finally I have to mention that the service was exemplary."}
{"text":"The perfect food, perfect location, perfect ambiance, perfect service all makes for the perfect experience. Hands down one of the most classiest and customer service oriented restaurants I have ever been to.   We were on our way to a concert and decided to get a bite before at a nice restaurant. Drove past the Cheesecake Factory and thought I wanted to try something different. As we were riding through the parking lot confused I just pulled up in this valet parking and said lets go and eat.  WOW did we stumble upon a gem. Upon walking in, we were greeted with a list of hosts who made us feel very welcomed. I was taken back by the decor and the surrounding of a vast array of vintage wines.   Everything about this place is first class. The service, the food, and setting. I ordered the Delmonico Steak and it was seasoned perfectly and cooked to perfection. As a order my steaks medium rare the quality of meat is priority, and the Delmonico did not disappoint. It is melt in your mouth quality steak.   The prices were what you would expect from a restaurant like that, however it is actually competitive with other prime steakhouses in the valley but you do not get this level of service.   Must visit Steakhouse for 2014!"}
{"text":"Love love this place!!!! Alex Guerrero is simply the best sever soooooo professional and patient. My steak was over cooked and fixed it right away no questions asked. Great customer service. Will be back in the future."}
{"text":"My boyfriend surprised me with a reservation here on my birthday and it was literally the best birthday dinner a girl could ask for :) I absolutely loved the presentation of confetti and card on the table and the great service here! Our waters were always filled up and people were so polite and always wanting to provide us service in any way. The drinks were strong and we absolutely loved the calamari here (very distinguished from any other calamari I have tried considering the added pepperoncini.  I had the surf n turf special while my boyfriend got the Porcini rubbed bone in ribeye (w the 15-year basalmic vinegar).  The filet on my dish was cooked perfectly and the lobster tail on mine was sweet.  The bone in ribeye definitely was paired well with the basalmic vinegar (really a nice flavor).  The portions were generous for the price and we definitely thought both meals were delicious and filling for the 2 of us.  For my birthday they gave us a dessert sampler of creme brulee and flourless chocolate espresso cake.  We thoroughly enjoyed the desserts and definitely will be back for more soon :)"}
{"text":"There is only one steak, and its name is ribeye!  Can't beat the ribeye cooked in the 1500 degree oven at CG.  What do you need for a good steak?  Quality meat, the right cut (and I go ribeye), minimal seasoning, and technique with a good hot oven! Started with the calamari, Rodney Strong Cabernet, spinach and bacon salad, finished with that great ribeye! Remember, its all about the marbling!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night, had reservations with a friend of mine.  They were great, we got stuck in a monster track jam and our cabbie had to go through the backroads so we were running late for the reservation but checking in along the way.  We showed up about 20 minutes late and, fortunately, they still seated us.  It wasn't super crowded at that point but it packed in right after.    The decor is nice and relaxing with a chill view.  It's not like a \"fake\" or forced Vegas experience, I don't think.  Just a nice steakhouse overlooking the back end of the strip.  We got a great waiter - Frankie.  It has to be part of a schtick but he looks and acts like a combo of Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro, ya know, the \"badda bing New Yahk\" thing.  Great guy, funny... very honest about the menu.  He told me the special and then said, \"But don't get that... get this...\"  I'm totally blowing it on this review, as I saved it a while ago but didn't finish it, but I forgot exactly what steak I got... sorry!  But, it was just stupid good.  My friend got a different kind - also amazing.  We had a combo of sides and starters, like salads, mashed potatoes, veggies, etc.  All good.  I get the impression that you can't go wrong here.  I'd definitely recommend but get a reservation - just to be safe.     Tip... don't try to find the damn hidden elevator in the parking garage below... you'll waste 15 minutes on a wild goose chase... just walk up the little stairs to the blvd, then take the escalator up."}
{"text":"Not as good as it was in the last few years.  Food is excellent but service and customer care not of proper quality for an establishment of this type."}
{"text":"Amazing experience! Great Great service! Highly recommend! Amazing martini service/pour.  Bountiful wine pours with their samplings.  Food was to die for.  If you want service, decor, and food, I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"The Capital Grille is a chain of restaurants that serve high quality American food. It is located on the strip right across the street from the Wynn Hotel. It's a little pricey but if you are ready to spend more than usual, this is a place to go and enjoy spending your time and eating. The atmosphere is classy and comfortable. If you are seated by the window, you'll have the amazing view of the boulevard. The wait stuff is professional and pleasant. They have a big selection of wines and a great bread basket as well. We ordered Lobster bisque. It was very rich and with big chunks of lobster. Their Steak is amazing, it is prepared as expected-without burning or drying out...  The dessert is good either. The caramelized cheesecake and flourless chocolate espresso cake are amazing with some berries on the side. That's a good way to finish your dinner and leave pleased and happy."}
{"text":"I'm still buzzed writing this review but I have to say my experience here was nothing short of amazing.  Service was exceptional.  The food was just fantastic.  We had the porterhouse, lump crab cocktail, fanny may oysters, and steak tartare.  UNBELIEVABLE!!!  And, don't get me started on the wine.  Elyse cab was delicious.  I would come back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"It's says a lot when a meal makes a person giggle like a teenager.  But that was my experience at The Capital Grille.  From the moment we were greeted at the door until our doggie bags (including a free sample of special seasoning salt) were delivered to our table, we couldn't have had a more pleasant experience or better meal.  My steak was done perfectly and the twice baked potatoes were the best I've ever had.  Much has been written about the lobster mac & cheese and every mouthful was worth a mention. The bartender made the best mojitos in the Valley and even dropped by our table to ensure our cocktails were to our liking!  It's not often that a bartender checks in on the diners.  Everything about The Capital Grille exceeded our expectations."}
{"text":"This was a party of 16. The Service was prompt and Erica our service was kind to us. The food was okay the mac and cheese specifically was great my salmon was very juicy and moist but I know several others in that party got their food was a bit overcooked. The reason I am giving it Up 3 stars specifically  because Our  waiter offered us drinks and food complimentary to the birthday girl. I repeatedlt said we did nir order rhe extra food. However, Once everyone got their check  everything that was said to be complementary was actually charged. I felt I was just it was deceitful however we did not want to make a big deal about it. It was my birthday and asked everyone not make a show of it but I I don't think that was fair."}
{"text":"Always a great time at these Elite events.   Would you say I am Yelp Elite cheerleader, a proponent of local to local connection, an ambassador to the savory styles of the unconventional dining?. uhhh Yes!  A lot of the time at any Elite event there is going to be certain things that are just implicit and expected. That being: raffles,  tasty food paired with great service, a great atmosphere of a business strutting its flare and Lindsey F.   All things necessary to foster a genuine hype in the yelp food community.  I can tell a great amount of effort and thought are placed into these events, but at the same time there is an essential arbitrary yet conciliatory uniqueness. This was sufficient, and served to conciliate the good will of the foody natives, with whom the congeniality of sentiment at certain points did more towards inspiring a friendly feeling than anything else that could have happened.   Basically, odds are you will find lik minded people (Julia T. and Maggie F.). It is those moments which make Yelp and all other community based companies strive. Flood the niche.  Thanks to CG and Yelp!  R\_"}

{"text":"This was my first visit to The Capital Grille and it did not disappoint! I wanted a really good steak for my 25th birthday dinner and found exactly what I was looking for. I made a reservation in advance and asked for a table with a view of the strip, and they were able to accommodate my request. We had to move our reservation back twice due to circumstances beyond our control... and they adjusted our reservation time with no problem. We started with a bottle of moscato and calamari for our appetizer. For our meal my SO and I each ordered the bone-in ribeye and shared creamed spinach, lobster mac & cheese, and mashed potatoes. The ribeye was easily the best steak I've ever had, it was seasoned & cooked to perfection. The sides were all wonderful. They definitely did not skimp on the lobster in the mac & cheese. They gave me a birthday dessert plate with a chocolate cake and a cheesecake. I didn't care for the chocolate cake but the cheesecake was great. Our meal came to just under $215 and it was worth every penny. i can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his 4th of July birthday (dinner on the 3rd). Capital Grille was my second choice -- my first choice was closed for the holiday weekend. And am I ever so glad it was.  When making a reservation I dropped that it was a birthday dinner. Upon checking in, the hostess immediately wished him a happy birthday by name and took us to a table adorned with a tasteful amount of birthday confetti and a card signed by the staff. Nice!  From there on out the service, food and ambiance was outstanding. It far exceeded my expectations from all the wonderful reviews I had read previously. Our waiter, Chad, was very helpful in helping us select items as we were a little overwhelmed by all the good reviews on yelp and the things people have told us personally. Drinks - a gin and tonic for him and a Stoli Doli for me. Appetizer was calamari, which was delicious. He got the 24 ounce porterhouse, which he ate every bit of. I had the bone-in kona crusted sirloin - AMAZING. A cup of lobster bisque is mandatory. The Lobster Mac and Cheese was an interesting grown-up take on the kid friendly dish. Not as creamy as the microwavable stuff, a little on the soupy side but it was definitely working. We got a creme brulee for dessert, which I discovered upon receiving the check that they comped it for the birthday.  The service is very well worth noting. I'm not big on fluff and getting my rear kissed as a customer, and the service exceeded standard customer service with genuine sincerity without flirting with that rear-kissing fakeness. Although I suspect if you are of that type that appreciates that, they'll do that too. The type of place that folds your napkin whenever you leave the table to use the restroom, but doesn't over-sir or over-madam you. My boyfriend and I are $2 pitcher, jeans and flip flop type diners but the service was welcoming and even though we were out of our usual element, we didn't feel like it.  I even got a follow-up phone call the next day asking how our dinner was!    My facebook status update right after dinner: \"I will be thinking about this meal for weeks.\""}
{"text":"Had an amazing 30th wedding anniversary dinner.  Attention to detail, going the extra mile etc. Food was outstanding. People bitching about the prices...shut it...it's an expensive restaurant.  You want cheap, head down to Eat N Puke.  This is a great place to celebrate very special occasions."}
{"text":"Capt. Grill is consistently good.  Great steaks, any steak. Truffle fries, lobster Mac n cheese, lobster bisque is a must. Salads are cold and crispy. Service the best. Thanks Kristen for the wine suggestions, and dessert selection. You're service is tops."}
{"text":"Wow, what a meal!  From start to finish a culinary carnival of delectible delights. Service was friendly and attentive, and our needs were always anticipated deftly by our awesome server, Jeff.  Our palatable pilgramage proceeded as follows:  Starters: FRENCH ONION SOUP, CHOPPED SALAD Soup was amazing - rich, satisfying and even though I didn't order it, I wished I had. Although I did stake claim to the melted cheese on the side of the bowl. which peeled off nicely and started the party in my mouth. Salad was good, but not very memorable.  Entrees:  SEARED SIRLOIN WITH BUTTER-POACHED LOBSTER, PORCINNI RUBBED PORTERHOUSE Hubba Hubba Hubba!  After my first bite of the lobster, all I could think was ... \"Why have I never had lobster like this before, and why would anyone ever want to eat it any other way!?\"  Truly a shell-fish shin-dig of buttery goodness.   My date's steak was amazing and so flavorful! Their balsamic reduction is killer, and my man spent the rest of the evening in beef bliss.  Sides: LOBSTER MAC & CHEESE and  SMASHED POTATOES THE best potatoes, evah! Perfectly seasoned and loaded with butter, they didn't need a thing except a delivery device to get them into my mouth ASAP! Thank God for spoons. Seriously spudalicious!  The mac & cheese was super good, though it could have used a bit more actual lobster chunks. Still it was super satisfying, creamy, and catapulted me into glorious cheesey gratification.  Desserts:  RASPBERRY CHEESECAKE and COCONUT CREAM PIE Jeff recommended the Coconut Cream Pie and boy, was he right! The crust tasted like a macaroon, which was a delightful twist.  A massively mouthwatering experience. My man ordered the cheesecake and it was excellent too.   Our evening at The Capital Grille exceeded our expectations on every level. From the wonderful portraits of Sammy, Frank, and Dean (among other Vegas legends) that greet you as you exit the valet elevator, to the classy service and sublime feast."}
{"text":"Alex knows his wine , and I request him every time!! You can't go wrong with anything you order one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas period"}
{"text":"Hubby and I decided to have a celebratory (new job) dinner, and were tempted by all the recent Yelp steak house debates to try Mastro's. But while going through a pile of mail I had set aside as junk, I found a $50 off postcard from AM-EX to Capital Grille. We decided to give it a try and save Mastro's for another time.  The service was fantastic. Our waiter, Reuben, was just the right amount of attentive (I hate being asked after practically every bite if everything is ok), and the other staff was also excellent.  We got a basket of bread to start, which also held some matzo-like crackers. Don't pass by the dark bread- I thought it was regular pumpernickel at first, but it had a wonderful crust with a soft and slightly fruity center- totally unexpected and delicious. We also received an amuse- a great little bruchetta topped with micro greens.  I ordered the caprese salad which was good, especially the yellow tomato slice, but I have had better mozzarella at Cibo. Hubby had the French Onion soup which came with a ridiculous amount of torch-melted cheese on top. The soup itself had great flavor (one of the best I've had), but could have been a little hotter for my taste. Hubby liked it the way it was.  For our entrees, Hubby got the Kona crusted sirloin (which was rubbed with a blend of decaf coffee powder, cocoa, and cinnamon) with shallot butter. He really enjoyed the flavor, although about half of his steak was really much more medium than medium rare. To me, the flavor was unexpected- I thought I would taste any one of the rub flavors before I tasted the steak, as they are all strong flavors. That was not the case, however- it was a subtle yet complex addition to the beef. I had the classic Delmonico rib-eye. Mine was perfectly done and quite tasty, although I must say that I have enjoyed my rib-eye at Bobby Q's every bit as much. The sides were fine- we tried the mushroom mix and the lobster mac n' cheese. We have been spoiled by our CraftSteak hen-of-the-woods mushroom ecstasy experience, so all else pales in comparison. I expected more from the mac- it was sort of mild and bland. I'm not sure what it needed- something that wouldn't overwhelm the lobster, but something nonetheless. Because we wanted to try a dessert, we took home plenty of food (the sides are large, and all share-able by 2-4 people).  We shared the coconut cream pie, which again was more than enough for two. It was in a tart style with a sugar cookie type crust, topped with a layer that we felt had cream cheese in it, then a layer of custard cream, covered by a mountain of fresh whipped barely sweetened cream and toasted coconut flakes. It was really delicious. The house blend coffee was truly outstanding, without even a hint of acidity. Hubby added Frangelico to his, and it was so good and rich that it did not need the cream he would have otherwise added.   All in all, Capital Grille gave us a very pleasant dining experience (aside from a couple of wasted chicks who were way too loud), and very good food."}
{"text":"Great Night in The Capital ! Friendly Staff and a great salmon dinner can't be beat !"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here last night for our 1st anniversary.  The food was amazing, however, the overall experience was subpar.  We arrived about 20 minutes early and went to the bar for a drink.  The bar was packed and very loud so we were really looking forward to sitting at at a nice quiet table but we were not.  Our table was right by the bar!  It was so loud and people were standing right by the table.  We were also disappointed to see people in hoodies and jeans the minute we walked in the door.  I was disappointed that there is not a dress code enforced.  Our waiter was very nice and attentive but we waited a long time in between courses.  We sat down at 7:30 and had an appetizer and salads.  Our steaks did not arrive till after 9.  Now I'm all about enjoying an evening out but that was too long to wait.  By the time our steaks arrived we weren't even hungry anymore because we had filled up on bread waiting.    For the price that we paid I do not think this place was worth it.  There are a lot better steakhouses in Pittsburgh for less money and you will receive a better overall experience!"}
{"text":"Wife and I stayed at Trump International for the weekend, and had come back from the day's outing. I'd heard of The Capital Grille in DC, and saw this one at the Fashion Show Mall (short walk from our hotel) so I made a reservation online and we went for dinner.  It was a Saturday night. They were busy, but not so much that it diminished the service one bit. From the personal greeting at the podium (I'd entered my last name online for the reservation, and the hostess used it; the person who took us to our table used it; and our waiter addressed us as Mr. and Mrs. when he introduced himself. I thought that was a nice touch.  Our waiter, Ryan, was everything a server should be. Personable, great sense of humor (while being appropriate at all times), completely knowledgeable of the menu, made great recommendations, and he was extremely efficient. There was also a young lady who ensured we never ran out of water. I think that might have been her only job, and she did it very well. (kidding, I'm sure she does other things, I just didn't see them).  We started with the spicy calamari appetizer, and it was delicious. We didn't finish it, because we wanted room for the entrees, but I can tell you it tasted nearly as good the next day warmed up in our NewWave. The variety of peppers really made the calamari flavors stand out, this may be the first time I had calamari without any dipping sauce, and I didn't miss the sauces at all.  I had the double cut lamb rib chops. There are 4 of them, about 12 ounces in total. I ordered them medium rare, and they were cooked perfectly. I love lamb when it's made right, and this was as good as it gets.  My wife had the bone-in ribeye, also medium rare. She loved it, and I had a bite and it was also cooked perfectly.   We had two sides to share, Sam's mashed potatoes (creamy and delicious) and maybe the best sweet corn I've ever had. It was fresh cut from the cob, as kernels were still together, and they mixed in some peppers and the combo of the sweet corn and spicy peppers was amazing. I mixed some in with the mashed potatoes, and it was great, but I found I preferred savoring each separately instead.  We shared the chocolate cake for dessert. It was good, can't say we were overly impressed but by then we'd had so much great food it might have just been us.   Prices are high for casual dining (our total with tip was about $270) but well worth it, IMO, for a special night out. The entire dining experience at The Capital Grille in Las Vegas was wonderful - they pamper you, make you feel special, and the food is delicious and the portions are generous.  Oh, one more example of the \"little touches\" they do to make your dinner special - we noticed my napkin was white, but my wife's was black, so she asked Ryan about it. He said they match the color to the clothing their guests are wearing - she had on a black dress, and he said that was so she wouldn't end up with white lint on her dress. Makes sense, but I've never seen that at any other restaurant, no matter how fancy."}
{"text":"I would rate this 5 stars if the food was better. Food was a 3, we ordered a filet and a porter house. Both tasted more like pot roast than steak. Service was the best I've ever seen before. We were celebrating our anniversary and they pulled out all the stops from putting a vase of flowers on the table, confetti and complimentary champagne and even 2 free desserts on a plate with happy anniversary spelled out in chocolate. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying this is one of the best steaks I've ever had!  This place is very bougie, so if you're looking to have a classy time, this is the place!  The interior reminds me of a man cave... like a very manly den back in the 50's!  I really loved that aspect of it.  The entire place is surrounded by huge windows to give you a great view............unless you're on the side facing the construction that's been sitting there for years.  Pretty sure they didn't bank on that happening when they built this place!  If you have an anniversary or other special occasion, they decorate your table all cute! Very romantic ;-)  Our server was amazing.  He was extremely friendly and didn't give off that snooty attitude that you sometimes get at fancy steak restaurants.  He explained the menu in detail, which usually I don't care for, but he was extremely helpful!    I got the seared tenderloin with lobster.  Be aware that the portion size is very small (he informed me this dish was \"for the ladies,\" and when I asked him why he explained that it was on the smaller side, so I was prepared.  Thanks again, helpful server!).  Despite this, I could only eat half of it, which was a huge shame because I couldn't take my leftovers with me :(  This was one of the most delicious meals I've had in my entire life.  My boyfriend's steak was also completely to die for.  We topped that off with the lobster mac and cheese, and oh my gosh- it was a meal to remember.  The only forgettable part about it was the Creme Brûlée.  Maybe we got a bad one, but it tasted like dirt and was completely the wrong texture- kind of grainy.  The only part that tasted good was the glaze on the top, so we scraped that part off and left the rest.  We probably should have said something, but I hate doing that so we didn't.  TL;DR I highly recommend Capital Grille and will be back time and time again for a romantic date :)"}
{"text":"As a corporate chain upscale steakhouse, this place does not jump to the top of my list for romantic dinner spots.  However,  it is most definitely a great place for a business lunch or dinner.   Since I am not a meat-eater, I can't comment on the steaks, but I've had their seared salmon and the seared tuna on separate occasions.  Both were expertly prepared.   I have been here for a private party as well and the service on each visit has been very good."}

{"text":"I had a $40 filet mignon at Ruth Chris a few days before eating here.  For the same price, the filet at Capital was 10 times better.  I would have paid double.  Amazing place, wonderful service, and everything we ate was beyond what we could have hoped for."}
{"text":"I had the tenderloin and lobster roll. It's probably the best lobster roll in the valley. The tenderloin was very tender, living up to it's namesake, and they put a wonderful medium cook on it. My only nit pick was that the drink menu didn't have prices on it and I was unpleasantly surprised when the drinks I ordered were more than I expected them to be."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited The Capital Grill last night to celebrate our first date night as a married couple, my wife's pregnancy, and my birthday.  Three huge life events, my birthday of course being the top of the list.  The Capital Grille and their team, specifically our server Terry, Micky, bartender Bryan, and future manager Stephanie, deserve the highest star score they could possibly receive here, they deserve an entire constellation!  Put the Milky Way up on their board.  It started with the greeting.  The hostess knew and acknowledged that we were celebrating so many special occasions.  She wished me happy birthday and my wife congrats.  When we were taken to our table it was decked out in celebratory swag with a card personally signed by the staff.  It was a touching gesture and we knew we were in for a treat.  The food was ridiculous.  We had the feta stuffed strawberries, awesome.  The calamari was cooked to perfection with just the right amount of spice that it didn't need any kind of sauce.  We shared the lobster bisque, SO MUCH LOBSTER!, and the mozzarella salad, legit!  Then we got to our mains!  I had the balsamic bone in ribeye.  It was cooked to perfection and I sat for 30 minutes eating it slowly to enjoy every amazing bite.  There was more than enough for me to save the bone and bring some home for my dog.  My wife enjoyed a pound of crab legs.  They were cracked to precision and so easy for her to eat.  We shared the brussel sprouts and lobster mac and cheese (don't skip this one!).  To finish it all off we shared a flourless chocolate cake and the best cheesecake I have ever had.  It was an incredible meal, but an even better dining experience.  There are SO MANY options for food, but it's the service and hospitality that truly separates one place from another, and The Capital Grille is lapping the pack with their team here.  Thanks again Terry, Micky, Bryan, and Stephanie for an experience my wife and I will be talking about for the rest of our lives."}
{"text":"Consistently tasty food with very generous portions.  My colleagues and I came here for a team dinner after a long day, and it was definitely a relaxing and pleasant experience.  The decor is muted, somewhat dark, a bit soothing.  I didn't have much interaction with the waiter, but have no service complaints.  My filet mignon was cooked perfectly and quite tasty, though not particularly exciting flavor-wise (e.g., no sauce or interesting seasoning... but some might prefer it that way, I admit).  The Caesar salad: crisp and delicious.  And the desserts?  Those were outstanding!  From the creme brulee to the cakes... mmmm!"}
{"text":"I don't give too many places 5 stars upon first reviews but there was something that put The Capital Grille in that category...  I made reservations for My Love's birthday weekend. We love dining out and this place was perfect because it isn't a place we'd go to every weekend. When reserving our table I mentioned that we'd be celebrating his birthday and they were ready for us!  We ordered the lobster and crab crab cakes, I had the surf and turf, he had the porterhouse steak and we shared the brussel sprouts. Everything tasted amazing. If I could've shoved those brussel sprouts in my purse I would've. They really were amazing! And his steak was one fit for a King. He enjoyed every bite, and enjoyed the bites he shared with me.  After dinner, he was presented with a complimentary dessert with \"Happy Birthday\" on the plate. It was a very nice presentation.  Here's where the 5 stars come in...when we first walked in the door we were greeted so warmly. While being shown to our table, every person we passed said hello, I mean EVERYONE! At one point, a manager came over to our table, said Happy Birthday, and engaged in small talk. Our waiter was also extremely helpful and pleasant. It felt as if everyone went out of their way to make us feel special. Now, it's not as if we walked in their wearing crowns or a birthday sash, so I'm thinking this...IS WHAT THEY DO! And we loved it."}
{"text":"Top Notch Food, Service and Views . You can keep your celebrity marked up steaks to yourself this place is for a true Carnivore.  That  seared crust on the rib eyes  are phenomenal with tenderness and juiciness inside , on occasion  a drizzle of a demi-glaze or chim churri sauce accompanied the bovine slab . Easy to get reservation,  across the street from the Wynn and modestly priced compared to other hyped up places."}
{"text":"One word - stodgy.   We decided to eat here after I received a gift card from a friend. I felt completely out of place. It wasn't very busy. Probably because it was way past the early bird witching hour. Or perhaps because there were three other fantastic steak places in a .5 mile radius *cough* Delmontico *cough*.  The worst part? As I sit here writing this review I can't even remember exactly what I ordered - some steak..knowing me it was a fatty of a rib eye. A good 50 dollar piece of meat should leave an impression on me and not just on my wallet.   So - come here if you like consistency (its a chain) not nothing really special."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience! Happened to stop in late Sunday night for dinner. Our waiter Jan was one of the most courteous, helpful and polite servers I've ever had. The French Onion soup was amazing and the Seared Tuna was a large portion of incredibly tasty fish with an excellent selection of dipping sauces. I will be back next time I am in Vegas and will check out the LA location!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with the other reviews, everything with this event was top notch!  The food was delicious, the drinks were fantastic, and the Capital Grille was nothing but class.  Drinks as soon as we walked in the door, wine, peach champagne cocktails and pineapple infused vodka (ranked as \"are you kidding me?!\" delicious).  Staff was everywhere to offer food or drinks, clean up a stray glass or plate, and accommodate our every request (glass of water, please).  Who doesn't love a gift bag of goodies and an invitation to come back for free lunch (again, \"are you kidding me?!\")  Haven't even started on the food yet.  Lobster rolls, tenderloin sliders, truffle fries, coconut creme pie, everything was FANTASTIC!!   The biggest shrimp I have ever enjoyed right next to the cool Yelp ice sculpture that proves YELP is the 'coolest!' (Ha!)  This was a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon!  Thank you YELP and thank you Capital Grille!!"}

{"text":"I honestly loved every minute in this place. Came here with my fam to celebrate my birthday. I was surprised to see birthday confetti on the table along with a birthday card. What a nice touch!   Our table was in a nice quiet corner right by the windows so we got a great view of the strip. Another nice touch!   Food was amazing! We started off with the fried calamari. It was tender and cooked oh so perfectly. I really liked that it came with hot peppers too. For the entree I got the scallops while the rest of the party got various cuts of steak. Sides we got was lobster Mac n' cheese, creamer spinach, and roasted mushrooms. Everything was cooked exceptionally well and loved that all the entrees came out at the same time! The dessert was a great way to end the meal. You get 2 free desserts for your birthday! One was a cheesecake and the other was a chocolate concoction...I can't remember exactly what it was but both tasted great!   Robert was our server and he was great! He was attentive and did a great job explaining the menu. Water was kept full and dirty dishes were cleared away quickly.   It is on the pricey side but definitely worth it! Great place for special occasions, date night, business...anything really!"}
{"text":"I had already wrote a review for the Grill in North Scottsdale, but this was my first time at the Biltmore location.  It is safe to assume that everything was an exemplary five star experience.  Was with a group, so we all ordered the signature Stoli Doli martini which was shaken so well that there was slight frost crystals floating on the top.  Great balance of Stoli and pineapple.  We all loved them!  Bread basket came out with pumpernickel and raisin, cheese onion and of course the lavash.    We all shared so the lamb medium rare excellent as well as the tuna served with 4 different sauces.  Perfect rare sear with the sauces some being spicy, one being soy and two others that unfortunately I didn't get to try do to my compatriots pounding the tune :)  Now of course one has to have the dessert.  So three were ordered-  first the flour less chocolate cake, always so phenomenal, especially if you like dark chocolate that isn't over sweetened.  The second dessert was the coconut cream pie that was remarkably good and lastly the cheesecake with berry side.  Instead of describing them in detail its sufficient to say less  than three minutes not one damn crumb remained of anything.  Service was A+ and made sure we were well taken care of."}
{"text":"I don't give out 5 stars unless everything is perfect start to finish.  Congrats Capital Grill as I wouldn't have wanted one thing different.  The first thing that came out was the bread basket that had lavash, onion and pumpernickel with raisin bread.  All really really good and served perfectly warm.  Fiancée ordered a salad, but let's not focus on that.  After all if you go to the Capital Grill, a salad should't be on your radar screen.  So ordered the porcini rubbed rib eye steak.  What can you say about perfection?  Served a perfect medium rare with the porcini rub and Cabernet hint in the sauce worked so well I could have ordered another one!!  Sides of mashed potatoes which were delicious and the asparagus cooked perfectly!  Matt the bartender paid attention to every little detail and recommended the seven layer chocolate cake.  Now not a dessert guy at all.  But who ever made that cake, stop by our house anytime to use our kitchen!!  A deliciously executed dessert that had cake and ganache with a vanilla creme glacé.  Trust me order this and you will be hooked."}
{"text":"How could you go wrong with the capital grill!? I love pretty much everything they serve. The coconut cream pie is a tradition at our house and we just love everything about this restaurant. Great food, service, and drinks thank you !"}
{"text":"As a business traveler, it is very important for me to rely on restaurants that provide consistent high quality food and service, and also cater to the local clientele.  No restaurant chain consistently meets or exceeds my high expectations, than the Capital Grille.  I stopped by the bar area today for a late lunch.  The bartender and wait staff were flawless in their service, and the shrimp/lobster patties were excellent.  When in Charlotte, I highly recommend the Capital Grille, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We were sat, the receptionist was nice. We waited for about 15 to 20 minutes and nobody came to our table so  we just walked out and left. No one stopped us:/ disappointing."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant!  We always go here when we are in town.  Food is absolutely fabulous!  The bone-in filet is the best steak on the planet.  Service is also wonderful.  Can not recommend this enough."}
{"text":"Excellent steaks, seafood and service!  Beautiful view of Las Vegas strip! Wayne Gorsek"}
{"text":"Dined here again last evening.  Food was exceptional in a very comfortable yet upscale setting."}
{"text":"Went for an early birthday dinner. We had the calamari with peppers as a starter with a basil gin martini and the bohemian all very good. The bohemian being the best out of both drinks. Not over sweet like many like it. For the main course we had the 22 oz Porterhouse steak and the Chef's Choice Filet Mignon with mushrooms.   We picked the Lobster Mac and Cheese and the Tomato, Basil, Mozzarella salad for our sides.  All excellent.  For dessert we had the cheesecake and the coconut cream pie.  It was a struggle at this point to eat a single bite more,  but it was so good we pushed through the pain.  Service was top notch and classic high end American style.  Everything came out quickly but at proper intervals.  Lucky for me the manager was a co-worker at a previous job and made sure we were well taken care of.  Definitely worth the $$$$ (dolla dolla bills yo - as Yelp says)."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed coming to Capital grille With my family. The staff are friendly and always welcoming. The food is good as it always is when I come in to eat. I'd probably rate this higher if I could."}
{"text":"This is by far the best steak house for service and price in Las Vegas! The calamari is the best I've ever had...and I've had lots! The cherry peppers are a perfect combo and always perfectly cooked. Even those who do not like calarmari always say it's great! If you're going to a steak house, you have to order a steak--all are great. Sides are amazing. If you like coconuts, the there's a fantastic dessert. Great wine selection. If you don't find just the perfect wine, ask for the captain's menu.   Service is always second to none. My fav server (John D) is gone :( but easily replaced with a few other alternates--Jimmy (handle bar moustache) and a newbie for me--Marc. They are all very friendly, fun and quite attentive. If everything doesn't come out just perfect, they ensure satisfaction.   There are many great things about this place and one of them, for sure, is consistency!  I always make this Capital Grille my choice whether entertaining for work or pleasure!"}
{"text":"I recently went to the Capital Grille for the first time.  For whatever reason we always chose other Steakhouses in Charlotte.  But I have to say that this place seemed to have that something extra.  Their customer service was excellent.  The servers went above and beyond which I don't always experience other places.  Not to mention the steak was cooked perfectly and the lobster mac was delicious as well."}
{"text":"This was a great restaurant. I went her for a conference and business meeting.  The waiters provided excellent service.  The steaks were amazing.  It was expensive, but it was good.  Don't forget to try the calamari."}
{"text":"What a lovely establishment. Boyfr took me for an impromptu date night after we had both gotten over headcolds, and we were seated in the backroom near a large, fun group who had just come from the Phoenix Open. Our waiter, Chris, was extremely knowledgeable and he made our evening extremely enjoyable.   Because it was our first time, we really enjoyed that Chris explained the menu, how the entrees and appetizers worked, the sides for sharing and went over the wine menu with us. I had a sauv, boyf went for a chilean cab (the only one on the menu and I highly reccommend it (I stole a sip)  We split a ceasar, that was delicious. I had the citrus glazed salmon, he had a filet and we split some mashed potatoes. The salmon basically melted apart and was absolutely delicious, as were the potatoes. He really enjoyed his filet, and took the rest home for our pup to have.   Before rolling ourselves to the car, we got into a great conversation with Chris about the midwest, his background in Aviation (we didn't mention that Boyf is a pilot) and the dinner felt like a conversation with old friends rather than a stuffy atmosphere.  I would highly reccommend this location for a great night out, and ask for Chris."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place! I've had the chance to eat dinner here as well as eat off-menu light bites when organizations I'm a member of have booked lunch here. I've also had the chance to enjoy a quick tour of their wine stocks, which honestly are impressive in and of themselves! Not only did I get a glimpse into the huge collection of wine but I found out that they have quite a system here to ensure that different wines are ready for serving throughout the night. So yep, when it comes to wine it's safe to say that these guys definitely know what they're doing.  Food wise, I can say after dining here during group outings that Capital Grille makes very delicious and tender meat dishes. I've had off-menu lamb bites and kabobs and can't even describe how tasty they were! The last time I was here for dinner I opted to stick to soup and salad, and believe it or not those options were just as satisfying as anything else I could have ordered. The bisque was thick and nicely seasoned, and the Caprese Salad was put together beautifully and drizzled with just the right amount of dressing - and hey, I love any place that doesn't drown its salads in dressing! And to finish my last meal off, I ordered the cheesecake with fresh seasonal berries. It was definitely one the best pieces of cheesecake that I've ever had, I think - it was both tasty and light and fluffy, so I left after eating feeling perfectly full rather than overstuffed from my delightful meal.  Service? No complaints. I've never had a problem here. The waiters here are always able to answer questions and help with meal and drink selections when we're having trouble picking what to pair with what. They've also always been quick to check on our waters, take away empty dishes, see if we need anything else - honestly they've always succeeded in making me feel like a special guest, which in a place as fancy and expensive as Capital Grille is always a good thing, I think!  I would absolutely come back for a big date or just to grab a drink and dessert, but unfortunately Capital Grille will always be a special occasion only sort of place. It's impossible to forget that the food here is expensive - particularly the steaks! - and while I don't mind paying for a high quality meal like the ones you can get here once in a while, those prices do mean that this place and my budget don't always mix well. Darn money, always ruining my fun!"}
{"text":"It was another true fine dinning experience !! Good things come with a price tag so indulge in a place with good ambience and great food as it is well worth it !! Carmen, Audrea and Andrea are awesome.  I am spoilt to the good service by Dwayne and Jose  !! They ensure I am having a great time !! Wine selections are amazing !!! Luv the desert selections as well !! Nick who is the managing partner was very pleasant. Would highly recommend this place.  Thanks DR MD"}
{"text":"Love the personalization! We arrived with only half our party, but we were seated and brought starter cocktails right away. Everyone (even the waiter) greeted my husband by name as we were seated (he made the reservation). I was suitably impressed.   The decor is top notch, muted and cozy lighting, just all around very pleasing.   Food is great, as is should be for how expensive this place is. I ordered the truffle fries because I heard how great they were, but they were nothing special.   My only complaint was that the ladies bathroom was dirty, i.e. towels and toilet paper all over the floor and in all the stalls. I thought that in a classy place such as this that they'd have someone keeping an eye on them, but it looked like they had not been cared for in a couple days."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of thier webpage and I got an email about a burger special .. so I went and had myself one.. FANTASTIC burger..    It was wagu beef with a fried egg and onion straws on the burger with a glass of Silver Oak included.. on yeah.. a side of truffle fries came with it also.. I'll just say my plate was clean when I  left and I almost  wanted to go back for dinner.. Its a  special only offered in the bar area .. FYI .. but the place was empty when I went around lunch time.   Yes.. I've eaten steaks here and  its also fantastic for that as well..  Burger was a  10!  but I still wanted bacon on  it too ! hahaahah"}
{"text":"Only my second time here but it was really good again. From making reservations to the valet, the customer service and attention to detail was great.   Our waiter, John, was very knowledgeable about the food and wine selection too.  All of our steaks were cooked as ordered.  The calamari and oyster appetizers were great. The shrimp cocktail were a bit tough to the bite.  Loved the wedge salad; there is something refreshing about the crispness of iceberg and their blue cheese dressing is not over powering with cheap blue cheese. I ordered the Dry aged porterhouse; very tender but there was a strip of gristle through the sirloin, making a third of the steak extremely chewy.  After eating our steaks, we were too full for dessert. We will return."}
{"text":"So far the best steakhouse, restaurant I'd ever eaten at. The friendliest service, treated me and my lady like kings and queens. They were extremely helpful with the menu, never rushed us. Our waitress, Michelle, great person, even suggested we share because the portions were huge. She was right, we shared the tenderloin and poched lobster and with an appitizer and desert in was more than enough. I can't wait to go back. A definite choice!"}
{"text":"Very nice evening with few friends. Lobster bisque was creamy with nice chunks of lobster. All the steaks  where perfectly done. Most importantly the service provided was spectacular."}
{"text":"Oh, I love Capital Grille.  For us, it's the standard bearer when it comes to a steakhouse.  So when we were in Vegas for our anniversary and needed someplace to celebrate the day, there was no question where we would go.  Of course the table was decorated when we got there and a handwritten note was waiting for us, with a wax seal.  We almost always order the same thing: lobster and crab cakes for an app, we both have a lettuce wedge for a salad.  I have the filet and the husband has the kona crusted ribeye.  We'll vary on what we have for dessert.  I love the Bohemian there - it's an awesome champagne drink that has raspberries in it.  It's almost worth a trip to the Grille just for that.  Anyway, our experience here was wonderful.  Our minor quibble is the lobster and crab cake weren't quite as good as we were used to, but everything else was spot on.  As they sometimes do, they came out with a complimentary dessert of a small cheesecake and espresso cake with \"Happy Anniversary\" written on the plate.  I really wish they would open a Capital Grille in the Bay Area."}
{"text":"We had a very nice time on our anniversary at the Capital Grille. The table was decorated with little heart confetti and they had left us a card with well wishes. Our server (who did a great job) brought us some fresh yellow roses for the table.   I had the shaved Brussels sprout salad as an appetizer and it was amazing. There were huge hunks of bacon in it. Husband had clam chowder and said it was very good.   For entrees, I had the sliced filet with mushrooms and fig sauce. It was delicious. My husband ordered the plain filet cooked medium, but it came out medium rare. We got lobster mac and cheese and mashed potatoes for sides. I was somewhat underwhelmed at the side items. The mac and cheese was too salty and the lobster was sparse. The mashed potatoes were over puréed.   Our server brought us dessert on the house for our anniversary. It was two miniature desserts: gluten free chocolate something or other and brûlée cheesecake. The chocolate thing was too rich for our taste, but the cheesecake? Oh my goodness, delicious!   I also had a really delightful Pinot noir with my meal. Can't remember the name of it but it was $11 per glass and I loved it.   Don't get me wrong -- this was a great experience -- however, it is my opinion that the prices here are designed to attract a certain clientele and repel others. I don't think it is exactly a reflection of the quality of the food. Just my two cents!  I would still recommend the Capital Grille for special occasions."}
{"text":"OK, so I have wanted to go to a Capital Grille for a while. Wife and I went tonight. Here is the review.  Capital Grille is the ONLY restaurant in its portfolio that Darden has not destroyed (yet). I am positive, that in time, they will, they just have not got around to it (yet.). CG was pretty good. I really enjoyed the Kona Coffee crusted steak and the lobster mac and cheese. The crab and lobster cakes were great. I also enjoyed the shrimp cocktail and sauce. The décor is faux stately which I do not like...but would if it were genuine. I guess that is the Darden touch....see it is already starting and it has only been a few years since Darden acquired it."}
{"text":"The capital grille never fails!  The lobster and crab stuffed shrimp is absolutely amazing and the parmesan truffle fries are to die for!  The service is always top notch and they are on top of refills.  The valet out front is awesome and of course the overall atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"Review #300!  When I am in Vegas I like to live it up (even more so when I win) so after a successful day of playing the tables my wife, kids, 2 friends, and I decided to visit one of their favorite restaurants The Capital Grille.  Our friends arrived first and ordered us a couple Stoli Dolis (I believe that is what its called).  I do not usually drink martinis but they were very good!  Great fresh pineapple flavor!  I like to go to The Palm back home but they are not super kid friendly when it comes to the menu but Capital Grille had a few perfect selections for my picky kids (mac and cheese and chicken strips).  Our dinners were great and the service was perfect.  My friend and I decided to go big and get some Louis XIII cognac to end our meal and they brought out a lovely silver serving platter along with the bottle (see my picture I posted).  I really enjoyed my visit to The Capital Grille and cant wait to go again."}
{"text":"Great romantic spot for an incredible meal. Strip views from huge windows, impeccable service, well age and cook steaks, great selection of appetizers and side dishes, and a fantastic wine list.  Negatives are that it's very expensive, and the wine list iPad is very cumbersome and difficult to use."}
{"text":"Normally this restaurant would be out of our price range, but my husband and I decided to try it during Restaurant Week. We were pretty underwhelmed, and agreed that they must have really been phoning it in on the restaurant week menu items. The food was fine, not great. The servers were very nice and friendly, but I expect more polished service at an upscale restaurant. The regular menu looked really good, so if we could have afforded that I'm sure we'd have enjoyed the food much more. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I try to get to Capital Grille every time I get to Vegas, and I come about twice a year.  The food is delectable, the steaks are A1, always cooked to perfection. They aim to please you, whatever it takes.  The service professionals are super friendly.  CG is just a wonderful place!  I love it!!"}
{"text":"By far the best steak house in Charlotte! Met our two daughters Friday after Thanksgiving for a lovely dinner.  10 oz filet was cooked to perfection with crab meat of equal flavor and ample quantity. My favorite side is the creamed spinach but the lobster mac and cheese is also amazing and loaded with lobster. My daughter had the crab lobster cake appetizer as a meal. Two four ounce cakes so generous she took one home. The tomato and mozzarella salad was fresh, tasty and had high quality balsamic to add to the flavor.  The wine list was expansive and high tech! Our server Amber was by far the highlight of the night. So professional, helpful, available, and yet not intrusive. We stayed several hours yet never felt rushed! We had more left overs than the Thanksgiving dinner and you can already guess what leftovers were eaten first! Great experience in every way!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Pretty much the word \"awesome\" sums up our entire dining experience! Hubby and I came here for our anniversary dinner. Capital Grille did not disappoint! We arrived early, and our table was ready for us. We were seated at a table with a view of the strip decorated with heart confetti and a handwritten  card. Our waiter, Raul, brought us a bread basket and complimentary  champagne. Service was impeccable! Raul was attentive but allowed us plenty of time to enjoy our meal in privacy. We dined on raw oysters, Delmonico steak for hubby, filets with butter poached lobster tails for me, roasted Brussels  sprouts  to share, and a complimentary dessert. Steaks were perfect and oysters were very fresh. Minor complaint (being picky here) was Brussels sprouts were a bit crunchy for our taste, but spot on with flavor.  Great experience, food, and service! Perfect Anniversary dinner! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Capital Grille is the epitome of the perfect steakhouse. The food, service, and ambiance are all amazing and totally worth the pricey bill.   I have celebrate several special occasions here and the waiters and waitresses have always gone above and beyond to ensure that it is a great night.   The steaks-AMAZING. I am not a huge fan of seafood, but the filet oscar with crab and Bernaise sauce on top is to die for. All of the sides are great to order for the table to share, too.   I have also heard that the lobster bisque is a must have.   Amazing desserts, cocktails and wine list as well.   Literally nothing bad to say about this place."}
{"text":"Food was great! The main lobster is so tender and the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella is amazing with the balsamic glaze. Although, what made my experience unlike any other was because our waiter, Ricky, was so attentive, personable, and generous!!!"}
{"text":"I consider myself fortunate enough to have had a business lunch here a few weeks back. The food was excellent. Steak and potatoes just what a man wants! It was very well done and finished with a 3 berry cheesecake. Worth the moolah!"}
{"text":"As Las Vegas locals we visit this Capital Grille location a couple of times a year.   First time we came here, we entered the Fashion Mall from the back entrance, hoping to find a place to eat that was a cut above a mall restaurant. We succeeded. The Capital Grill, located at the front of the mall, has a view of the Strip's Encore and Wynn hotels. I didn't have reservations, Yet, the restaurant was able to accommodate me and my partner despite a rather large party who took up most of the front part of the restaurant.  We also ate there last night for our anniversary and once again they did not disappoint. Starting with the reservationist, Mallory, the friendly greeting from the maître d' and the great Strip view from our table it was an outstanding experience. The service we received from our server Alex was exceptional. He asked about our time schedule and made sure we were on time for our show at The Wynn. We both decided on steak which is not always the case. I had the Delmonico while my wife had the sliced filet prepared with mushrooms and onions; both were delicious. The wedge salad was really nice as their blue cheese dressing is not overpowering. We tried the Truffle Fries for the first time and enjoyed them. Of course we had the stoli-doli which is their signature drink. Love them.   A while ago we tried the Lobster Mac 'N' Cheese and we found this dish to be amazing. The double-cut lamb chops were delicious and perfectly cooked, too. My wife marveled over this bone-in filet mignon with every bite. When we were first-time Capital Grille patrons, the restaurant sent us a complimentary dessert, which we matched with a dessert wine and a port. However, the coconut cream pie is our favorite dessert.  The wait staff were attentive and provided helpful suggestions on what to order. Those with large appetites will enjoy the steaks. Those with smaller appetites will likely take home a to-go bag. The cocktails were tasty. We were allowed to sip an talk prior to the start of our meal as long as we wanted.   It's tough to beat the combination of view, service and food that this Capital Grille provides. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner. The crab bisque was great. The bone in filet is to die for. Excellent service James was attentive but not intrusive. A must see ."}
{"text":"We celebrated our wedding anniversary tonight and the  service was amazing, our server was Amila she was just the best, thank you for making our night so enjoyable.. And the food was outstanding.."}
{"text":"I love this place. My first experience was awesome because my friend knew a few of the employees but since then I've been treated just like family. Today T. West served me at the bar but I've had lovely experiences with all staff.   Quick to make your order what you want to your liking. I've never sent anything back or ordered something not on the menu but they strive to accommodate requests.   Mark, Bob, John, Raoul, Gina etc are all excellent. They are smile all day. Good staff.   Always make the experience. The food is great too. The wine list is good. Love the Meiomi Pinot. Salmon salad- grilled. Mmmm. Steaks are pretty good too. Recommend the coconut cream pie. It's more like a cookie custard.   I'm a vey happy customer here."}
{"text":"The crab and lobster cake were great, lots of crab and big chunks of lobster.  Their steaks are not prime, but the dry aged delmonico with mushrooms was actually better then expected, a bit too salty though.    Service was good."}
{"text":"We love the Capital Grille. We've been to the ones in Las Vegas and Newport Beach, and the food is always consistently good. We had the surf and turf Caesar salad, french onion soup (which was excellent), the wedge salad and lobster bisque which was loaded with chunks of lobster.  Our server, Coco, was friendly, professional and very attentive.  Definitely a good place to go to if you want consistently good food and service."}
{"text":"Okay if you like bland and tasteless. I have turned down a many celebratory invites here over the years because I just don't find any pleasure in their offerings. I had a business lunch there once and didn't eat much of my food because we were so engaged in conversation. I realized later that I really was impressed with what I ordered, which must be why I didn't bother to eat. So, for that reason, I hadn't had the desire to dine there since. This weekend I decided to accept a birthday dinner invite and give them another try since it's been a few years. Terrible mistake! I ordered the chicken dish. Yeah, there's basically only one. It was so tasteless except for the char flavor, that I literally had taken one bite and decided my meal was over. My plate sat at the table for the remainder of the evening. The wait staff never once asked about it. Never offered to get me something else. Even when they asked if I wanted it boxed, never inquired about why I was throwing out a full plate. NEVER AGAIN! People love to splurge here, but there are much better options in CLT"}
{"text":"Another wonderful evening on Valentine's Day Wednesday. We were warmly greeted and seated quickly. Our servers, Cyndi was prompt and friendly as was her assistant, Brian. Both were very attentive and their service was excellent. We were seated at a booth with white table cloth sprinkled with heart shaped confetti, which set a nice tone for our Valentine meal.  Then the chef sent out wonderful smoked salmon Hors d'oeuvres and an assortment of warm breads with seasoned butter.  The calamari appetizer was wonderful and we ordered the seared beef tenderloin with butter poached lobster tail, which has become our favorite and it was cooked to perfection. The potatoes au gratin are a must order along with the roasted wild mushrooms. We were pleasantly surprised with a beautiful red rose mid meal and it made the evening extra special.  We ordered crem brule for dessert. Yum!! Thank you again Cyndi, Brian, Nick and Stephanie for your gracious service and another memorable meal at Capital Grill. Marsha and Mark"}
{"text":"By far best of the chain steakhouses.  We had a wonderful lunch here.  Excellent service by a 30 year steakhouse pro, Peter, a Hungarian native.  The Spinach Salad & Caesar, the Calamari with spicy cherry peppers, and the Filet were all phenomenal.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"What a night,  please go there and ask for David. Went to high school with him .we played football with the steelers offensive coordinator. He could have anything in life; he would prefer taking care of you."}
{"text":"Consistently Great! I can always count on Capital Grille to provide me with a wow experience whether it's for my birthday (fresh flowers on the table and personalized dessert) or a work celebration (complimentary appetizers and bottle of champagne) the service and dining experience are always exceptional. Most recently I tried the double cut lamb chops and omg they were so so good-well seasoned and prepped perfectly to my preferred temp. My all time favs and must have are the brussel sprouts, truffle fries and bone in-filet if they have it get it (it's like a ribeye/ filet hybrid, filet mignon's tenderness with more flavor)! And of course the desserts, it would be to hard to pick a favorite between the flourless chocolate cake and the cheesecake brûlée style both are magical and memorable. Can't wait for another reason to go back."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner with my wife. They had our table decorated with some birthday confetti and a hand written note.... nice touch!   Our Waiter was Charlie and he was a fantastic waiter. He really took care of us.   I had the salmon which was great and cooked to perfection. My wife had the filet oscar and we were shocked as to how much crab meat that put on top of her steak! The steak was completely covered in this huge pile of delicious, sweet crab meat. It was almost a meal by itself! We could have split her dish.   Most reviews mention the lobster Mac and cheese so we got that and yes, it is extremely delicious with big chunks of lobster. If we were to go back we would try something else though.   This place is expensive. It is a steakhouse but even so it is probably $20 per person more than your local steakhouse... but you are on the Las Vegas Strip so that is what you get.   Oh, we also tried the house signature cocktail the stoli doli and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite steakhouses in town. Second visit and it's just as amazing as the first. Our server knows his wines and food. His pairings are amazing. The food is always always always amazing. I can't say enough about it. Tonight we ordered ribeye and twin African lobster tails with a side of grilled asparagus. We complimented it with a bottle of North Valley, a Pinot Noir. It was all cooked to perfection. The 15 year balsamic was the best part. To finish it off, we got a cappuccino and a warm double chocolate cake. I can't say enough about this place."}
{"text":"This event was phenomenal and one word stands out: class. The atmosphere of Capital Grille, the establishment's staff, the food - elegant, all of these. My fellow elite yelpers have pretty much described the details of the experience of this event, so at this point this is what I could add: kudos to Lindsey, Gabi, and the rest of the yelp staff for organizing an event that has such panache, and introducing me to an establishment that is definitely a place to bring family and friends to for a truly spectacular dining experience."}
{"text":"My wife & I have always enjoyed our dining experience at the Capital Grille.  This last time however was not as perfect as we've experienced before.  We had a 7:15 reservation on Valentine's Day.  We got there around 6:30 to check-in then we headed to the bar for a pre-dinner cocktail.  Matt, the bartender greeted us, made us a couple of delicious drinks and was very friendly.  By 7:30 I noticed a hostess looking around for someone.  I thought maybe she was looking for us so I flagged her down.  Turns out she was looking for us but had the wrong description of my wife written down.  She was looking for my wife, wearing a maroon top and black bottom.  She had a backwards.  We were escorted to our table and when we arrived they were still getting it plated and ready.  Shortly after we sat, we noticed that every other lady had a red rose she was given by the seating hostess when they were presented with their table.  But not my wife?  Next, our waiter greeted us kindly.  Asked us if we'd like any special water.  I asked for Pellegrino.  About 5 minutes later, the same waiter comes from behind and fills our water glasses with his pitcher of tap water.  Wait a minute??? did he forget we just ordered Pellegrino?  After all, he was the one who took our order.  About a minute after getting the tap water poured, an asst. waiter comes out with our bottle of Pellegrino.  He looked a little confused when he saw our glasses already filled so he grabbed both glasses and left with them and brought fresh clean glasses.  Next, our waiter brought a basked of bread and butter.  After he was out of sight I noticed there were no bread plates on the table.  After 5 minutes our waiter returned and asked about the plates, he apologized and returned with some. It's all about details and consistency.  The hostess should have made sure that every lady got a rose and the waiter should have noticed we had no bread plates.  It's those little things that make a big impression.  Next, we really enjoyed the way the tables were decorated last year for Valentine's Day with little red confetti, a valentine card from the staff, etc...  This year, nothing but white tablecloths for everyone.  Having the table decorated is kind of fun and something we remembered.  The rest of the evening was great.  My wife got the gorgonzola truffle crusted NY strip with the cherry cab reduction.  Truly amazing actually.  I got the bone in rib-eye and it was cooked perfectly.  The sides were delicious and the cheesecake dessert is always a must.  Will we be back?  Yes, but not sure about Valentine's Day."}
{"text":"Always amazing! Absolutely the east French Onion soup anywhere (and I typically have it if it's on menu) get the Crock it easily feeds 2-3 people unless it's your meal. Great service and food always, but expected considering the prices. Nice location on the strip and adjacent to the Fashion Mall."}
{"text":"Our first stop after flying in from San Jose, CA and before attending Game 5 of the Stanley Cup Final was an incredibly prepared dinner at the Capital Grill in Pittsburgh. Our San Jose Sharks group was quite large almost filling the entire restaurant. Kenny, our waiter was \"Most Excellent\" and his attention to detail was spot on.   Immediately, Kenny brought a warm basket of breads.  The house-made pumpernickel bread with raisins was the highlight, and I will have to have it shipped to California. Kenny also had an excellent knowledge of the Wine list and recommended a unique full-bodied Pinot Noir from Oregon with flavors of cherry, red plum, and dark chocolate. One by one, course by course, the food arrived and placed on our table family style sharing all of the sides and appetizers. Of particular mention, was the perfectly prepared crispy Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarello with Vine Ripe Tomatoes. The Grilled Asparagus in Lemon Oil and the Scalloped Potatoes were delicate and brought to the table in a wonderful presentation. The filet mignon was a perfectly prepared Medium Rare. Kenny also arranged for a Pittsburgh Latte to go. Thank you very much to the entire staff and most especially Kenny for a wonderful \"Group Dining\" experience."}
{"text":"The apple pastry dessert was UNBELIEVABLE. I loved that the server gave me his card at the end of my meal and invited us back. They asked us if we had ever been to capital grille, and found out we were locals and treated us like GOLD! The brown bread was delicious. The blue cheese wedge was excellent. Also my friend wanted a baked potato because she is diabetic, and our server went out of his way to secure one for her from the kitchen! And it was delicious!!! Her filet mignon was outstanding. The silverware (especially the steak knives) is gorgeous. We also asked for a view table at the last minute and your staff accommodated us for that as well within 15 minutes. So we waited at the bar. The bartender was lovely and the bar area is spacious and warm. Also the design of the restaurant and the interior is absolutely stunning. The hostesses that greeted us when we arrived was welcoming and warm. The ladies room was clean and quiet - I love the paper towels (they are elegant). The attention  to detail and customer service in this restaurant is probably one of the best on the strip. One of my favorite things is the restaurant is QUIET (no blaring loud music where I have to scream over my meal at my friend). It was just right! I love CG and will absolutely recommend it every time. Oh did I say our meal was delicious? Ha! Just great 10 out of 10!"}
{"text":"If I could eat at The Capital Grille, every day, I would.  The service and the quality of food is impeccable!!! Sir Richard is a jewel and Armin is a diamond, they always make sure that your experience is one of a kind, whether I go with my husband on date night, to celebrate anniversary or birthdays or simply having a family dinner.  No two experiences are the same other than the quality of personal care that they provide. Oh don't let me get started about the chef's, every time we go there I try to take David home with me but he said his wife won't let him come...he he.  I Love, Love, Love this place."}
{"text":"I have definitely had better steaks than at the Capital Grille. However, they do have one dish that consistently makes my mouth water at the mere thought, and that is the lobster mac n' cheese. OMG I know it's served as a side dish but you can make that for me as my meal! Please be sure to try this dish when you visit. Overall, the fine dining was good and the service was great."}
{"text":"Overall we had a great experience at capital grille for restaurant week.  Food great, ambiance perfect, timing of courses was spot on.  Everything you expect for The Capital Grill.  Unfortunately service was a downfall, which I never see at this type of place. Our server Matthew was just a little odd.  He seemed to be a very fake person and I truly felt he was not enjoying his job.  I felt like I was being belittled the entire time.  Next time I done there I will specifically request NOT to have his as my server."}
{"text":"Valet is available  for parking. .they were slow bringing  us the bread appetizers.  They were quick to refill our water. We had appetizers  cocktail  shrimp  and oysters . They looked good but did not taste fresh.i ordered  crab legs with she'll but came without. The waiter misunderstood.  We had potatoes  Aug rating but came with a crust that I did not like. We ordered a steak that was undercooked.  Food was good but disappointed  with their mistakes"}
{"text":"It was my birthday on the Vegas Strip in July, 2014, and I chose this as the spot for my special birthday dinner with family.  We had reserved the table months before and Megan, a concierge, had decorated the table with happy birthday glittery confetti and a birthday card.  She was very welcoming in greeting us upon our arrival and showing us to our table overlooking the Strip.  This place does have very nice dark wooded decor.  After our stellar arrival, the visit became just average.  I ordered grilled salmon and it was very dry and bland.  I have had better at much less expensive restaurants.  Our server (I don't recall her name) was not very friendly and had an abrasive personality.  She was efficient enough, but not enough to make up for the lackluster food that came at a very high price tag!  I have had better meals at Applebee's for far less money!  In short, don't believe the hype about this place.  Save your money and go somewhere else in Vegas that always delivers well in food quality and service, such as Billy Bob's Steakhouse at Sam's Town!"}
{"text":"The wegde salad is wonderfully blue cheesy and always enjoy the entrees.  Also love there sorbets."}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch at an odd hour between lunch and dinner. The place was empty so we had the best server to ourselves and a great table.  This is one of those places where even for lunch, you are going to drop a dime to eat or drink the awesomeness.   I started with a cup of the clam chowder, then had the sliders along with the homemade grapefruit soda. YUM!  The french onion soup is really good too. My friend had that.  Everything was awesome. Normally this sort of place is too \"stuffy\" for my style - but I have to admit, the experience is always perfection. Our server brought us over a little amuse bouche' as well - the squash soup - so yummy - it tastes like the season."}
{"text":"Let's start with the service.  Andy was our waiter and he took care of everything we could possibly want.  He gave us great suggestions from the menu that helped with the overall experience.   We had a shrimp cocktail for a appetizer, it was served ice cold with the best horseradish ever.  We both had steak for our main course.  They serve dry aged beef.  You can cut it with a fork and the flavor is to die for. We had lobster macaroni and cheese.  Big chunks of lobster with very creamy cheese. Desert came with dinner for a birthday celebration.  Cheesecake and Chocolate cake both got an A. Sure hope this review helps people make a decision on where to dine in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I had a table for four last evening. We were thanking someone for help that they provided us all year long. I made a reservation about three weeks in advance. I typically thoroughly enjoy dining here. On this evening, not at all. We were seating in the lounge right next to the doorway. The foyer area was packed which allowed the bar and lounge to back up with unsafe crowding. The table was not a normal sized table for four. The waitress had to yell when speaking to us. There was little opportunity to have conversation with the noise level. I had countless ass in my face from people standing near the table. Constantly be bumped as well. At 6:30 pm they were out of shellfish platters and augratin potatoes. How can that happen? I can't afford to come here but once or twice a year. After spending about $440 with tip all I got was \"it's really crazy tonight. Come back another time, I'm sure it will better.\" Guess what it will probably be a long time. Again the food was good. But I come here for the full experience - no excuse was going to be acceptable. There are other overpriced steakhouses. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"The best of the best... top notch facility and quality food... filet hollandaise was unreal... pricewise is high but you get what you pay for.  Great dim atmosphere   My go to for special occasions"}
{"text":"I've only gone to the Capital Grille for work-sponsored lunches and dinners so it's easier for me to rank it higher since cost isn't really an issue. If I had to pay for it myself, it would end up as a more special occasion or i-need-a-pick-me-up-lunch type of place. I really like the Capital Grille because even though the focus is on higher end meat and seafood, the vegetarian options are particularly good which is hard to come by at most restaurants in the same category. The Cobb salad (you can get vegetarian) is great because it's big, filling, and fresh. The veggie plate you can special order is a perfect entree, and though it's basically just a combination of all the side veggie dishes I think the sum is definitely greater than the parts. There are buttery roasted mushrooms covered in garlic & rosemary & thyme, grilled asparagus, sauteed spinach, and roasted tomatoes that add a wonderful sweetness and acidity to the dish."}
{"text":"Went to CG again tonight and definitely redeemed itself. Had the lobster bisque soup for appi and shared the sliced filet mignon with cippolini onions and wild mushrooms with my girlfriend and was definitely very happy with this selection. The fresh warm hot rolls were exceptional as well. Definitely a fun time. May be even willing to give Bourbon Steak a second try...especially because it's so close to home!"}
{"text":"Went here for a group dinner and it was one of the worst experiences I have ever had in a restaurant. I got to the dinner late and had been seated for no less than 15 minutes before I was able to flag down a waiter to get a drink. Then when I attempted to place my order the waiter stood there and argued with me about what I ordered (apparently a co-worker was previously in my chair and moved to another table so I could take her spot). Regardless, I'm perfectly capable of remembering whether or not I placed an order. As such, I do not appreciate being argued with by my waiter and finally told that I would get what he thought I ordered and could deal with it then. When I finally got my well done New York Strip (yes I'm one of those people who doesn't enjoy my meat bleeding on my plate, terrible I know), I find that it is medium rare. Well done and medium rare are not the same thing... not even a little.. there are like 2 steps in between them. My steak was taken back and came back medium... still not well done like I originally ordered. Needless to say I will not be returning."}
{"text":"After an unpleasant experience at the Scottsdale store, we decided to try this store this week. We were glad we did. The place seemed to be as busy as the Scottsdale store was 7 days ago, including successive groups in the meeting room. Although it was hectic, staff seemed to have everything under control. The 601 was good, of course. The wine list was different but had good choices and our waitress Shay had good suggestions. She was very attentive and bus service was constant, management pitched in and other waiters kept track when she wasn't right there. What matters to us is service: lots of places have good food but when good service is lacking, we wonder what we pay for. The Cobb salad was good: Shay recommended a different preparation and while I couldn't see the difference, I appreciated the suggestion. The steak sandwich my wife had was good. My wife had berries with cream: nothing was wrong this week. We had the kind of experience we expect from Capital Grille that we missed at the Scottsdale store last week."}
{"text":"The place is nice and the atmosphere was great.  This place reminded me of  Peter Lugers in Brooklyn NY, when we entered. The steak quality was not of the Peter Lugers but was different. The Demonoco steak was delish!!!! The filet meon was so tender, the lobster wrapped in shrimp my wife said was good. The special last night was blacken bass and my nephew thought it was great . Over all a nice evening and good food and the service great all the way. My daughter spilled soda on her steak and the waiter takes it the kitchen and regrills the steak dry and brings it back to her and she was happy. The waiter tried to accommodate her when she requested a pickle they even had that for her ( she loves pickles). So she enjoyed her meal and that made my evening.  The lobster Mac was just like all the reviews very good, and happy we stopped in while in Vegas."}
{"text":"The only thing better than the service at this restaurant, truly is the food. All of the staff from the door, to the table, the check ins, and back out the door were incredibly polite and warm. The food was unexpectedly great - having the surf n turf special this far from an ocean. The filet and South African lobster were each so tender and full of distinct flavors. The lobster bisque was perfection . I was even beginning to think they put something special in the water !"}
{"text":"Worth every penny. Best steak I've ever had. I had the Kona sirloin and my boyfriend had the fillet and we were both in heaven. Steaks were perfectly cooked and seasoned. They melted in our mouths. Be prepared to spend about $40/steak. We shared the mashed potatoes and they were so creamy. The Caesar salads were ok. The wine list was a little overwhelming (well for us) but our waiter made some great suggestions. For dessert I had the flour-less chocolate cake, which was rich and my boyfriend had strawberries and ice cream (forget what it's called the Capital Grille or something like that) which was so good."}
{"text":"Friends introduced in to the Stoli Doli which I highly recommend. The Waygu burger and wine pairing is a great deal."}
{"text":"On our December trip to Las Vegas, staying at the Wynn Towers, we decided to have one dinner away from the hotel.  Because the cabs in Vegas are so dirty we wanted to be able to walk to a restaurant.  Since the Capital Grille is directly across the street from the Wynn Towers our choice was easily made.  We have never eaten at a Capital Grille, which , according to the manager Mathew Foody (yes, that is his real last name),  has 50 locations.  The entire meal was wonderful.  We first ordered the Prosciutto wrapped Mozzarella.  It was so good and enhanced with the fresh bread basket.  We also ordered a bottle of wine.  The cab was a 2009 Markham from Napa Valley.  At $48 I thought the price was very reasonable.   After eating this large portioned appetizer we decided to split the dry aged Porterhouse steak.  Again we were not disappointed. Ordering it medium rare the meat melted in your mouth. The creamed spinach side was to die for. We passed on the desert menu and instead had an after dinner drink in their beautiful bar.  Jessica, our waitperson, was the best.   She was very attentive and explained the menu with ease. She made our evening memorable.  Also, the manager kept checking on us to make sure we were thoroghly enjoying our dinner.  Kudos to Capital Grille in Las Vegas.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Who knew that Capital Grille has amazing lunch specials!? I went to Capital Grille today for lunch and was shocked at their affordable lunch prices. For $18, you can choose your choice of soup or salad and an entree! {And of course their amazing bread basket}. Their entree options include; Dry Aged Sirloin Steak Frites with Red Eye Jus, Maine Lobster Roll w/Salt & Vinegar Chips and Jumbo Shrimp with Israeli Couscous & White Wine Mushroom Broth, to name a few. I ordered the \"Cobb\" Salad & oh my goodness, it was seriously fabulous. The mustard dressing was so light and perfect. The steak was cooked to perfection, you could literally cut it with a fork. I will most definitely be back soon for this fabulous salad! It was worth every penny."}
{"text":"I have been to The Capital Grille probably 10 to 15 times. Most times I've been very impressed. Unfortunately the past two times were very disappointing. My wife and I visited in November for our anniversary. My wife ordered the filet cooked medium. They brought out a well done steak. Normally we wouldn't complain, but at $60 for a steak I expect top notch. Our waiter was great and immediately took it back and brought another in 5 minutes. Believe it or not it was also cooked too much! But it tasted good and they didn't charge us so we were happy.  We visited yesterday for my Mother in laws birthday. I ordered a strip steak for $50. To be totally honest it was one of the worst steaks I've ever had. Very tough and chewy. I've had better $10 steaks at Ponderosa. I'm not exaggerating. I took 4 bites and threw in the towel. I didn't want to make a fuse being with my in-laws, so I quietly asked for it to be wrapped up. It's sitting in my garbage can right now. I don't know if they're sourcing lower quality meat or what. For $50+ steaks, they should be excellent. The service was great as always, but the food was just awful. Frankly, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Just wanted to go for appetizer and desserts. Had French onion soup which was excellent and very filling. For dessert had house cheesecake and chocolate flourless torte. Both were absolutely top notch! Cheesecake was probably by far the best we ever had (puts Cheesecake factiry to shame) and flourless chocolate cake is right up there as well. Didn't  gave any main courses so can't comment on that. Prices are in line with upscale steakhouse, for our soup, 2 desserts, tea and coffee it was $50ish not including the tip. So be prepared to spend. Service is top notch. Very good experience."}
{"text":"Had a late night dinner after arriving to Vegas Friday night. Easily made a 10:30pm reservation and were seated immediately with a great view overlooking the strip. We started with lobster bisque (the best I've ever had) and a roasted beet and goat cheese salad (amazing, we all devoured this). Then we shared a few rib eyes and lobster mac n cheese. Finished off our meal with a delicious coconut cream pie. One was big enough for 5 of us. We were all so satisfied and can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Another fabulous meal and best service in town. Lobster bisque, sea bass, and coconut cream pie. Still thinking about it."}
{"text":"We came back today. We were apprehensive but things went very well.  Everything was great: food, service, etc. a real effort was made to make up for a prior bad experience. We would have continued to have meals there but this was a very good experience!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Capital Grill many times in the past and the service at this location was just horrible. We came in a little late. We had two servers neither of them wanted to take our order. When they did come to the table both were rude. We got up and left. Party of 8. A shame."}
{"text":"The food and service were fantastic, everything was extremely fresh and cooked to perfection.  Our server Sheri (spelling?) was amazing, and we never had to wait for anything.  Would reccommend to anyone in the Charlotte area!"}
{"text":"$120 for 4 drinks and a steak that was below par.  I went there with a friend of mine for cocktails and a light dinner.  We each had 2 drinks which were fine, but decided to share a steak entrée.  I can't cook but I bet I could grill one better in my backyard.  For $48, I expected the steak to be moist and flavorful, but it wasn't.  Even if it was only $20, it still would have been awful.  Service was very attentive so no complaints there, but for a place with a very limited menu, the offerings need to be superb.  This was not even close.  Definitely will not go back or recommend. Too many better places within a mile of this one."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum. For a chain Steakhouse they sure do it right. I have eaten here many times and am always floored at the level of service and the quality of their food. Tonight was a lobster bisque starter, bone in filet, lobster tail, brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes. Absolutely amazing! First off the soup. It was hot, creamy and full of lobster pieces. They topped it with a bit of truffle oil and it was creamy perfection. I have never had a bone in filet till tonight. I ordered it medium rare and it came perfect. The bone really added a nice flavor. If they offer it I would highly suggest it. The lobster tail was steamed and good. I love lobster and The Capital Grille knows how to do it well. Both sides were very good. Not to salty and plenty of each."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent and Frankie takes care of us like always every time I've been to Vegas."}
{"text":"If you are in Pittsburgh and need a great steak, go to Capital Grille.  Wine list was crazy good, food was farking good!  Service is exceptional.  Always crowded."}
{"text":"Steak tartare was amazing! I sat at the bar and the bartender was fun to talk to. We had a great conversation and she knew the menu well. I ordered the Ny strip and it was cooked to perfection. The lobster mac was amaizng. I really enjoyed my experience!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best wedge salad dressing I have ever had. I loved the salad so much, I barely had room to finish half of the fabulous cheeseburger. We ended up taking the desserts to go (flourless chocolate cake and cheesecake)....to share with the family at home. We waited to make our reservation until the end of the week....sadly, because we would have gone a 2nd time! Our server, Michael was efficient and attentive."}
{"text":"Just went here for my Bachelor party and we had the private room along w/ our favorite waiter, ALEX.  Boy, this place is the bizz. Great food, service, decor and prices, even by Vegas standards.  I highly recommend all the appetizers, soups, and any steak in the Chef Selection area. You cannot go wrong. Don't forget about the Stoli Doli!  I'm also not a huge dessert, but make sure you get the Coconut cream pie, even if you do not like coconut!  Thank you Capital Grill, especially Alex, for years and years of stellar service."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful date night at The Capital Grille. We set reservations using OpenTable, for 7:00 P.M. Once we arrived right at 7:00 they had our table ready for us and sat us within a few moments. It was a pretty busy Saturday night, so I am glad that we set reservations. Once we were seated we were immediately greeted by our waiter, who was dynamite! My glass was never half empty, our orders were 100% correct, and they have a special Mascato Di Asti that is only available to Prime Restaurants and Resorts. I loved the wine and asked him where I could buy a bottle, he explained that it is rare and usually snagged up by restaurants and top resorts first, which happens with limited selections. Without asking, he went and asked the Restaurant Director, who then brought us over a bottle at a discounted price to take home. Amazing service!  For an appetizer we ordered the Fresh Oysters, yummy! Excellent quality, cleaned, and great pairings. I am an avid steak guy and prefer my steaks either Blue Rare, Rare, Twice Seared, etc. So I ordered the Filet Oscar, Blue Rare and my steak was perfect! My wife ordered their Seared Tuna with Ginger Rice, which was excellent! You have to try their Lobster Mac and Cheese! WOWZA!!! We also ordered their Truffle French fries which were dynamite!  For dessert we had the Coconut Cream Pie and the Cheesecake. Out of this world!!!   This is a definite try for my upscale foodies."}
{"text":"Filet mignon. That's pretty much what I get every time we visit The Capital Grille. Long before my hubby and I moved to Charlotte, I came to Charlotte a few times on business trips and each of those business trips included a night out at The Capital Grille.  The quality and consistency of the steaks are what keep me coming back. The service is always fantastic and if you happen to mention before hand that you're celebrating an occasion, the staff provides little extras, like decorating your table with confetti, to help you celebrate.  Besides the filet, a few of my favorites are Pan Fried Calamari with Hot Cherry Peppers, Creamed Corn with Smoked Bacon,  and Sam's Mashed Potatoes. And I think the Chocolate Hazelnut Cake is a perfect way to end a perfect meal."}
{"text":"I've been going to capital grille since it opened here and its always been pretty good, but I went the other night and it was outstanding!  The Lamb chop appetizer is excellent!  The Porcini rubbed steak with the 15 year balsamic was out of this world as well.  Great service and one of the best views in town."}
{"text":"I'm not so sure why everyone is so in love with capital grille. I've had the filet & the lamb here and to be honest, I was not blown away. I personally really like my steak charred, so maybe I can be biased when it comes to reviewing their steaks. The lamb was a dissapointment to me completely. I did not enjoy how it was cooked, or how it was seasoned. I felt like the entrees were sub par. The Au gratin potatoes wer DELISH though. The Sam's mashed potatoes are probably the best mashed potatoes i've had at any steak house here."}
{"text":"Celebrated dropping our son off for college with his mother's birthday. Our server Carolann was delightful. She delivered complimentary champagne and dessert. We will be repeat customers!"}
{"text":"We had a fabulous anniversary dinner at The Capital Grille. Everyone was so amazing in helping us enjoy our special day. We were seated at a secluded booth with an anniversary card and heart confetti on the table.   We started with the signature calamari, always a favorite. My husband enjoyed the classic Caesar salad with shaved Parmesan and crunchy croutons while I enjoyed the spinach salad with large pieces of bacon, feta, mushrooms and purple onions. At Robbie, our waiters recommendation, I ordered the special, a 16 ounce bone in filet. I have never seen this on a menu before. WOW! It was superb. We finished the evening with a cappuccino and an anniversary dessert plate. We recommend The Capital Grille for any special occasion.  We will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Though I'm generally worn out on steakhouses, I have to give Capital Grille props for the best steak and steakhouse I've experienced. The Filet is melt-in-your-mouth tender and full of flavor. The atmosphere is upscale, corporate-feeling, but still manages to be fun and cozy with family-style sides and friendly waitstaff.   If I'm going to splurge on a steak, I'll be seeking out a Captial Grille."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you want great food out of the hustle and bustle of Vegas!  Service, food, and view was fantastic.  Our waiter Jimmy, was great.  Food is ala carte and portions are quite large.  Will return when I go back."}
{"text":"We celebrated our 26th Wedding Anniversary here and were treated like royalty. We ended up being  1 hr late for our original reservation at 8:00pm. I called them at 7:30pm, and they graciously moved us back AND kept our requested strip view table reserved. WTG!  Service was impeccable. The Stoli Doli cocktail  was superb, as was the tenderloin with lobster tails. We also split the spinach bacon salad (great) and a side of grilled asparagus (allright).  For our anniversary, they presented us with a complimentary dessert sampler of cheesecake (Greatness!!!) and a flourless chocolate cake (great). We liked both of those better than the scrumptuous looking but not tasting Coconut pie. The pie was essentially maybe a 1/2\" layer of cream-cheese like consistency coconut flavored filling, not very sweet at all, toppedwith a massive pile of whipped cream and caramel sauce with a wafer thin huge coconut cookie. The toppings and cookie were better than the pie itself we thought. Go with the cheesecake instead.  Great place though! If I had to choose between this place and our \"Go To\" steak house (Del Frisco's), I'd have to give the edge to Del's. The steaks are probably equal, but their desserts, sides, and their similar pineapple infused vodka drink (the V.I.P. Martini) is better and much bigger.  You'll have a great meal here though."}
{"text":"The Capital Grille was AMAZING! The bone in rib eye was utter perfection and probably the best steak I've ever had in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"LOBSTAHHH ANYONE!?  The food is EXCELLENT here, i was truly impressed.  Hubby took me out on a surprise dinner, i was fine with some wendys but no not for him lol. and boy was i happy he decided to go all out.  Atmosphere was intimate, some serious fine dining.  We started out with the lobster and crab cakes which melted in my mouth. Lobster can either be terrible or amazing depending on how its cooked, and Capital Grille got it right!  As if the lobster and crab cakes werent filling enough i decided to let hubby splurge and got the Filet Mignon. BAZINGAAAA! hit the spot, had me thinking i was in ruths chris or one of those high end steak houses. It was cooked to perfection, medium well, what else exists?! and a side of au gratin potatoes.  The service was unbeatable, the server was there for my every beck and call, so nice and attentive i really enjoyed being treated like royalty.  Pricing was very high, but for the quality of meal and service i got, i would say its 100% worth it.  Please try and make a reservation because it gets pretty packed in there. And make sure you get the coconut cream pie! tell em sasha sent you!"}
{"text":"Went here for my sister birthday celebration. I have to say I would not be returning here at all. My experience here was not great. The waiter (Jason) was very weird. I think he got high before he came to work. For some reason he felt it was ok to talk about smoking marijuana with our party. That was very unprofessional. The whole time he was at our table taking orders he kept looking down at my breast. After dinner he brought out spoons for everyone. He placed everyone spoon down on their napkins but when he got to me he pretended as if the spoon fell out his hand and the spoon landed right on my breast. Like seriously...so unprofessional and the food was not that great at all.   Will not be returning"}
{"text":"I went here for my best friends birthday! We were visiting Vegas for the weekend. She had many restaurant to choose from but I'm glad she choose this one. The service was amazing. The food was delicious and fresh. I had the scallops and lobster macaroni. I would have my own birthday celebration  here."}
{"text":"There were 6 of us for dinner and it was restaurant week. Their menu had a fish and several steak choices. I got the filet with their mashed potatoes and green beans. It was pretty good, although somewhat typical, but my husband's salmon was even better. They know how to make the outside crispy while the inside of the salmon is like butter. The plates all come out together with this sort of marching band presentation that really impresses diners. They're trying these new iPads for drink orders that don't work that well with only one per table....hard copy menus make more sense (we sometimes get carried away w technology!) rather than trying to pass one iPad around an entire table. Lastly, we needed separate checks and while offered, it took forever to process...."}
{"text":"I went here with one of my friends for a yelp event back in January and it was amazing. Well I went back to try their $16 lunch plates(as we had a certificate from the yelp event) and was a little less than impressed. Let  me start with saying the service from our waiter Sergio was amazing, he did a great job with everything and was very nice he was also courteous to ask us if we had any time constraints for our meal so that he could acccomodate. Now let me start on the food. I ordered the clam chowder followed by the Mini tenderloin sliders with green beans. The clam chowder was mediocre nothing to write home about, the sirloin sliders were ok. While one of my sliders was cooked to the perfect medium rare as I had asked the other one was closer to medium well and a little charred. The green beans while they did have great flavor they were unfortunately not very hot. John ordered the clam chowder followed by the Wagyu Cheeseburger and truffle Fries. The cheeseburger was overcooked he has asked for a medium and it came out well, the fried egg on top was not cooked nearly enough if it were mine I wouldn't of been able to eat it because it looked way to slimey, the truffle fries were about the only thing that was tasty on his plate. Overall I feel that for the meal it was 5 star pricing for 3 star quality with again the exception of the service. Maybe for dinner they are much better but I probably will not be back to try."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times.  It seems that it is getting exponentially worse.  I think the steaks are medicore and the crab crakes and sides don't do it for me either.  I do like the wine special that they run in the summer where you can sample multiple wines for an affordable price.  Their cheese cake is top notch, I will give them that."}
{"text":"Terrible attitude!! Made a Reservation with Open Table for 11pm. I show up in time to be told they are close since 10 something and of course can no longer seat me. Supposedly being a fine dining restaurant you should not have this kind of \"mistakes\" and make ppl waste their time coming all the way to your restaurant. And try to be a little bit more courteous since it was your bad and not mine. I use to kind of like this place, never coming back."}
{"text":"We went to the bar for drinks and appetizers before dinner. Unfortunately, they sat us right next to a door leading to the outside patio. There were a bunch of men who were  smoking on the outside patio and every time they opened the door to go to service them, the smoke from the patio almost choked us. Food and service were good but they should ban the smoking and get with the current times. Fine diners do not want to smell the stench."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner with a few friends last night!  First time coming here, always heard it was good but figured we'd try for ourselves.  Glad we did!  Two of us ordered Gorgonzola crusted filets, and 2 ordered seafood.  Both of the fish dishes were amazing, and our wives were very happy!  All the sides were incredible (MUST get the Brussels sprouts!!), and the deserts were just fantastic.  There was a small issue with my steak, wasn't cooked as ordered (which the waitress strongly agreed with), but what impressed me most was how they responded!  The manager personally came out and issued apologies on behalf of the kitchen, made it up to us with a food comp, and the new steak was prepared and tableside within 6-7 minutes.  No harm, no foul!  These things happen... how they respond is what sets places apart!  He seemed genuinely upset and embarrassed, not just typical lip service.    Overall, fantastic experience and we'll be coming back for sure!  Highly recommended for parties that want both great steak and seafood options!!"}
{"text":"Love capital Grille. Great location. Great food. Nice wine selection and amazing desserts!"}
{"text":"My visit on 9/2/16... I'd like to begin with saying, our waiter- Charles...was extremely polite & was very patient. He was very focused on our off the menu choices & was eager to please & make us feel welcomed! He was always smiling...giving you that warm & friendly feel & his attentiveness to our order was unmatched with his high level of service!! The Food, Drinks(Wine & Cocktails), & atmosphere was truly 5 Star as usual!!"}
{"text":"Can I just say that when my boyfriend expressed an interest in celebrating his birthday dinner at CG I was ok with that...but as a person who may have a steak only once a year..I wasn't thrilled. I had called ahead to say it was his birthday. From the time we walked in the front door until we left ( almost 3 hours later) we received the VIP treatment! Our table was sprinkled with glitter and tiny foil cakes etc. A birthday card had been provided. The General Manager and many other staff members stopped by to thank us for celebrating our special occasion there. The lobster- crab cakes were fabulous. We each had a salad..for me greens with pears, Gorgonzola and candied walnuts..and the steak..can I just say..the BEST steak that this reluctant meat eater has ever had!!! I had a porterhouse ( half went home with me to top a salad today ) and it was done to perfection! Each bite perfect. Boyfriend had ribeye..not a bite left over and we split some amazing grilled mushrooms. So fabulous. Ok and then dessert..the Grille provided a beautiful dessert accompanied by two glasses of champagne..a perfect, delicious, elegant ending to a perfect evening.  Thank you staff..you made us feel very special, the food was the very best and attention to detail was superlative! We won't be waiting for a special occasion to return!"}
{"text":"Delicious dinner, very high end experience. They make you feel right at home and really do treat you like royalty. The servers alone are not just pulled off the street, they are all in the food industry, and have been serving high end for multiple years. Treat yourself to capital grille!"}
{"text":"The view,the food & the service all deserve 5 stars! Alex was wonderful,my hubby & I celebrated our 6th wedding anniversary here & it was very romantic & we will definitely be going back here! We loved it!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome ambiance, decent service. I ordered the serloin steak which was perfect. Also had the mashed potatoes and asparagus and the calamari. All were fantastic. The calamari are serviced with spicy peppers.   Yum!"}
{"text":"I was very reluctant to write this review, but am so shocked that this happened, maybe it'll be of help to the restaurant.  First, let me say that the Manager was VERY professional & accommodating.  Our Buss Person was such a nice guy!  OK, here goes:  We were in for lunch (we like to go for lobster, since we've always had excellent meals).  We were seated and our waiter came to the table and informed us that it might be a longer wait than normal for us to order & get our meals.  This was the first thing he said.  He was shadowed by a new employee & I figured that it was probably difficult to train and wait tables - hence, the length of time.  We got our drinks - the exterior of my glass was sticky & looked dirty.  He took the glass and poured the ingredients into another glass (saw this-he was showing the new guy this \"procedure\").  I got the same drink with a new glass.  If a glass is dirty on the outside, what is it like on the inside?  We ordered. When we ordered the lobster, he hesitated & finally said \"yes, I guess we can do that\"  Firstly, we had the wedge salad.  It was indeed a wedge, with small green & red tomatoes.  We did not want the \"lardons\" which are like small pieces of rubber unchewable bacon - so we passed on that.  I asked the waiter specifically if they were still using those chewy things and he said yes.  The blue cheese dressing had no blue cheese chunks in it.  Prior to the salad, the bread came out with a piece of flat bread and 2 rolls like cement. The lobster came out along with the mashed potatoes.  There were so many skins in the potatoes that we had a hard time picking out the actual potatoes.  The lobster:  it was again... so tough we couldn't even cut it.  (taste of claws were good - they were more tender) - that's when we called for the Manager, who saw what we were dealing with and comped that portion of our meal - which was nice.  We then ordered 2 coconut cream pie desserts.  The pies were piled high with a completely tasteless cream (seriously-no flavor, sugar or anything), a crust that you (oh god, I hate to say it) could not get your fork into.  There was a paper thin layer of actual pie filling that was really good.  So!  There was so much wrong with meal, we were embarrassed to keep complaining!  Just glad to leave, but we felt like they were getting rid of old stuff in preparation for Valentine's Day."}
{"text":"Biz Dinner don't know what it cost but am sure was a lot. Had a bouillabaisse that had good seafood but very salty. For what we likely paid I thought fairly avg. I'm such a snob!"}
{"text":"I ate there last night with two friends for a can't-make-the-wedding-so I-want to-do-something-special for you dinner.  None of us were disappointed.  This was my third visit there and, like each time before, everything was superb.  The service was exemplary and the food...it continues to WOW.  My friends each had a steak.  I had the salmon.  We all felt that this was some of the best food we had ever eaten ANYWHERE.  Yes, the prices are insane.  But for a special occasion dinner, I can't think of a better place in Charlotte to go."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about this restaraunt! I took my mother there for her birthday and she left feeling special. The wait staff were absolutely wonderful. They were very attentive. We both ordered Halibut with a share of Lobster Mac and Cheese which by far is my favorite. For the sides we had the sautéed spinach and grilled aspargus. Absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant....the food, the waiter and waitresses are all outstanding!!! Cannot say enough about this place...it is consistently perfect in everyvwsy"}
{"text":"Not bad, but not my first choice for the area. The staff are friendly and the food is good, but it just feels too much like a man's club.  That being said, it is a great place for guys to go for dinner who are really looking for dinner. I think I need more... of something."}
{"text":"One of the best steakhouses in Charlotte, no doubt.  My most recent visit to the Capital Grille was because of a special occasion and by letting the restaurant know ahead of time, the staff went above and beyond what I expected. The attention to detail and the attention of Rebecca our waitress was amazing and made our evening special.  When it comes to the food, our appetizers were perfect and nice portioned sizes. My wife had the Pan Seared Chilean Sea Bass with Citrus and Pea Tendrils and it met her exacting standards. I had the Dry Aged Sirloin with Au Gratin Potatoes and both were cooked perfectly and the flavors impeccable. One thing to remember for some Yelpers out there is that the menu is a la carte so take that into consideration.  I would definitely recommend the Capital Grille for special occasions or just having a nice dining experience for groups or couples, you may want to leave the kids at home however."}
{"text":"My friend and I were on a 'budget' trip to Vegas (EG: not looking to splurge over $200 per person on dinner) and after some yelp research on his part, we decided to mosey on over here for a nice steak dinner.   We didn't have rezzies and yet they sat us by the floor-to-ceiling wall of windows with a spectacular view of the strip. BALLIN'.   Service was up-to-par and timely. When it came time to inquire about wines, I always like to ask for suggestions and almost without fail, servers will upsell and recommend the two highest priced wines. Initially I decided to pass on the wine as I already was struggling with a (really stiff!) Manhattan but after a couple bites of my steak, I waved another server down (ours was clearly occupied with the next table which had a party of 6, so I didn't want to interrupt her with my inability to make decisions the first go around) who asked if I liked Malbecs. \"ABSOLUTELY\". It was priced well, he mentioned it was one of his favourites and since it was not the most pricey wine on the list, I trusted his recommendation. It was a fabulous pairing.   We ordered french onion soup (cheesy goodness) which had a nice depth of flavour and wasn't overly salty, the lobster bisque special (this went really well with the Manhattans, strangely), and both of us had filet mignon with mine medium-rare.   Great, well-rounded experience."}
{"text":"I really want to thank Capital Grille for their exceptional service that we received. We came in after a Vegas elopement wedding and they completely took care of us. Rose petals on the table and perfect service that had many waiters coming over and speaking with us. This is how fine dining should be. Everything they did was right, and the food was exceptional- which is consistent with every Capital Grill experience we've had. I cannot recommend a restaurant more than I would recommend the Capital Grille."}
{"text":"Had dinner here yesterday, great food and service. I and my boyfriend shared a bone in rib eye, which is tasty and juicy. My parents shared a filet, which is in a smaller amount but they said it was wonderful. We actually had a group of 12 people and all satisfied with the food and services, definitely will come back again and might recommended to our friends."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant meal : calamari appetizer,  petit filet mignon medium well,  creamed spinach and scalloped potatoes with a stoli doli or three. I love the Vegas location. I always request the strip view. The service is impeccable.  This is a 'take your time and eat' place, not some where to go if you are in a rush. Its right at the mall, take the elevator up to this restaurant, and you're there. Windows all around, a fairly panoramic view no matter where you sit.  I love Capital Grille. Please, if you go - request the Stoli Doli. They have a glass 'barrell' where pineapple rings steeped in Stoli vodka. You can ask for a 'sample'. Its just such a delicious drink."}
{"text":"Capital grille gave me half bitten stake for my dinner. Im so disgusted. Worst place every"}
{"text":"After having experienced a business lunch at Capital Grill within the last year, I decided to treat my family (wife and two teenage boys) to a dinner at Capital Grill during Restaurant Week in Charlotte.  I thought is would be a very nice meal and someplace I had not taken them before.  Eating in the best restaurants in town and when we travel is not unusual.  The food was very hit-and-miss and so was the service.    Let's start with the food.  We ordered two appetizers for the table that were not part of restaurant week.  The Calamari and the Mozzarella wrapped cheese.  The calamari was excellent and cooked perfectly.  The Mozzarella was good but not the tastiest or smoothest mozzarella I have eaten.  Both were worthy.  For the first course, my oldest son had the clam chowder which he enjoyed.  The rest of us ordered the mixed field greens salad which was awful.  I have had a better side salad at Wendy's.  It was totally tasteless and un-inspired.  None of us even finished half the portion.  When the waiters helper asked if we were done, we told him to please take them away and how horrible they were.  The three men had the filet for our main course.  It was a very middle of the road filet.  I am not sure if they lowered their quality for restaurant week but it tasted no better than an Outback Steak.  Even my 15 year old recognized the poor quality of meat.  My wife had the Salmon which was better than the filet but nothing exciting.  She only ate half the portion and it was not worth packing up to take home.  The mashed potato side was amazing and the creamed spinach side was average.  The creme brulee and flourless chocolate cake for desert were both amazing.  I would recommend just hitting the bar for these late night after a show.    The service was also only marginal.  A big let down compared to the service received at lunch.  The waiter reached across the table versus walking around, and he plated the food close but not just right so you had to re-arrange the positioning of every dish before eating it.  The atmosphere is beautiful.  I would return for a business lunch but don't waste your time or money on dinner or taking someone you want to impress."}
{"text":"When I am in the mood for 5 stars, I go to the Capital Grille. I go in with very high expectations, and my visit to the one in Las Vegas had every single one fufilled (except of course, the one about Kate Beckinsdale falling in lust with me..but I digress...) Our waiter, David, was on point. He excelled in making us feel welcome, gave great tips on the menu, and was, overall, a great ambasador for the venue. The food was amazing, as usual. My steak au poivre was cooked exactly to specs...which is one reason I keep returning. Each course was exactly as one would hope for...well done!"}
{"text":"Came in for a corporate meeting and yelped steak houses.  The service was excellent from the hosts to the waiter. Food was delicious great place! !! I'll come again if ever in scotsdale!"}
{"text":"Wait staff attentive, food was flavorful. However the star of the show is the AMAZING CHEESE CAKE! My wife normally doesn't eat sweet, but she enjoyed it as much as I did. Not too tart or sweet but just right.    Yes I am a fan of CP!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal here as usual.  Filet great as usual.  One of the best calamari's in town."}
{"text":"Second-rate version of a great restaurateur. NYC my favorite. \"Be careful. The soup is very hot.\" I sent it back, It was cold. The server actually said this, no really, \"I felt it with my finger.\" What? You put your finger in my soup? I hope he meant the heat generated by the saucer under the cup of  French onion. The soup was very ordinary. My steak was adequate. Hard to import a restaurant, put it in a place like LV, and hope things will work out. Some of the celeb locations here are hot at times, but they do not keep up a consistent delivery of food and service. Best thing all of them have going for themselves is PR, which means hype."}
{"text":"I havent been here in about 8 years due to a bad meal I had long ago that I couldnt shake.  So I decided while I was Uptown having lunch to give it another go...it has been afterall about 8 years.  I have to say I was extremely impressed!  Everything was exceptional and well made.   Our waitress Alex was so sweet and knew the menu well and recommended the lobster bisque which wasnt on the menu.  It was perfection!  HUGE lumps of lobster meat swimming in a rich creamy broth.  OMG..it was so good.  Plus the truffle fries are the best Ive had in Charlotte so far!  The manger Bryce was so nice and accomodating.  He went out of his way to make the experience great.  Will not hesitate to return!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation the night before and requested a private booth. I was shocked when I arrived and they had a private booth waiting. Typically when I do that at restaurants, they never read the special instructions. Especially when it comes to seating. When we arrived the restaurant was really nice and clean and we were seated almost immediately.  The menu was very easy to understand and we really enjoyed having a lot of options. We ordered the crab and lobster cake appetizer and it was delicious. So delicious my husband did not want to share, but I made him. Ha! There were two crab and lobster cakes along with chilled corn.   I ordered a glass of Riesling which was delicious. It was semi sweet and I loved it! For dinner, I ordered the bone-in New York strip with Gorgonzola on top. It was absolutely amazing. We also ordered the mushroom as a side and the potatoes au gratin. Both were equally amazing.  The manager came over towards the end and address me by name and asked if I enjoyed everything. I really appreciate it that! It was very personable.  After dinner, they bought us two small desserts. The creme brulee cheesecake was amazing.   The restaurant was pretty pricey but it was worth every dime."}
{"text":"Capital Grille is amazing for special occasions! I went to celebrate my anniversary with my girlfriend and they outdid themselves. They decorate the table and also leave a \"Happy Anniversary\" card. Compared to Fahrenheit in Charlotte, Capital Grille takes the trophy! Amazing service and complimentary valet (something Fahrenheit doesn't offer). Lobster Mac & Cheese is a must have! We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"We had never tried The Capital Grille and decided to try it during Restaurant  Week. I believe it now tops the list as one  of our very favorites  !  We  were celebrating an anniversary and they had our table decorated  with red confetti hearts and rose petals. It  was such a special touch ! This restaurant  is so classy and goes  above and beyond . The food is amazing as was our waiter, Chris. He was one of the best waiters we have ever had anywhere. He takes great pride in his job.  If you are looking for a very memorable  dining experience ,  Capital  Grille  is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Why offer reservations if you can't seat a party within 30 minutes of their reservation time?  At least the group that complained ahead of us was offered drinks.  All we got was, \"Are you sure?  It shouldn't be but another 5 or so minutes.\"  (We had offered to sit outside, and there were a LOT of empty tables outside..shorthanded on a Saturday night?)    Fortunately, Inca's Peruvian restaurant in the same center saved the day (love the Lomo Saltado!)"}
{"text":"I've eaten there twice while traveling on business.  Both meals were outstanding.  The service was perfect and so was the food.  Everything about how this place is run is top-notch.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Ate at the CG for the first time during Restaurant Week while dropping our son off at Pitt  In short, it was amazing!  Coupled with Restaurant Week it was great value.   Food was delicious from the starters through to the desserts. Best selection of fresh baked breads. Steaks prepared perfectly. Mashed potatoes addictive.  Green beans even a veggie hater could appreciate.   Our server Kelley's attention to detail was spot on and the staff that supported her were always timely and smiling  Great overall experience."}
{"text":"Love! Spent another anniversary and were treated like royalty.  Food, Service and atmosphere are wonderful. They do know how to take care of their guests and even follow up the next day to make sure all was a great experience.  It is expensive, but worth it!"}
{"text":"I came to Las Vegas with my significant other for a post Valentine's Day, romantic weekend. We arrived Feb 16, 2018 and headed straight from the airport to Capital Grille for dinner. There are many great, celebrity owned, steakhouses in Las Vegas, but I felt we could not go wrong with the standard - Capital Grille - and were not disappointed. Alex, our waiter, was very knowledgeable about food and wine. He recommended the bone-in fillet mignon. Wow, packed with flavor and delicious, especially with sides of lobster mac and cheese, brussel  sprouts, and mashed potatoes. We washed it all down with a bottle of Ghost Block, a fantastic, reasonably-priced Cabernet Sauvignon which our waiter recommended. Bottom Line: Great service, great food and wine, and great atmosphere. What else is there to say?"}
{"text":"Excellent?!!! fantastic food, everything was perfect from the temperature of my boyfriend's filet to my mother watering salmon to our awesome waiter!! presentation of everything was exquisite. MUST order the brussel sprouts and lobster Mac and cheese !!! a bit pricey but definitely worth it!!! find a cheap bottle of wine on the menu and you have a perfect dinner."}
{"text":"This is a three star restaurant with five star prices. Food is good but nothing is great.   Steaks are about $50 a la carte. They are not anything to write home about.   Sides are fine. It's been an hour and I can't even remember what we had - not memorable.   Deserts were subpar. I had to wash down a bite of my bfs chocolate cake with a massive gulp of water. It came out cold and bad.   Charlotte has lots of other great restaurants I would recommend ahead of this capital grille."}
{"text":"Great place to have dinner on the strip. The waitress was very helpful, courteous and funny Great quality for the value. It is my second visit and I love it"}
{"text":"Capital Grille is probably the best chain run steakhouse that I have ever been to. That's saying a lot. Especially when we have dined at hundreds of high end steakhouses in AZ, CA, and NV from chains to local spots. What makes it so special? Well, read below to find out.   Service: We were greeted in a warm and friendly manner. They use a 3 person team and are constantly checking in throughout the meal. They constantly kept the drinks flowing and the water topped off. Top notch Service is expected at a high end steakhouse. This place should be writing the syllabus for \"How to Run A Steakhouse 101.\" Some of these \"other\" high end places in Phoenix might need a refresher course. Im looking at you Mastros.  Appetizers: They have this spicy calamari with peppercini/Italian hot pepper dish that IS and WILL be the bench standard for all future calamari dishes. I truly doubt that anyone will top this calamari dish. Gauntlet thrown.   Food: I had the dry aged new york strip. It was a coffee rubbed steak and grilled to perfection. I normally am a rib-eye guy. But this steak, rewrites the whole game plan. This steak had soooo much flavor I practically had a religious experience. The only thing that stopped me from becoming a full time parishioner was the limit on my AMEX. Wife had the tenderloin. It was spectacular as well. The lobster mac and cheese and mushrooms were also solid.   Bread: Warm and soft. Especially the pumpernickel and onion bread.   Dessert: Coconut Cream pie was heavenly. A solid finishing piece.   Atmosphere: Traditional steakhouse. Dark woods. Deer heads on the wall. Life sized oil paintings. I loved it."}
{"text":"First time here and I mean the view was amazing!!!! They were fast in seating our party. They start off by serving fresh warm bread with butter. The French  onion soup was better than anywhere else I've ever tried it. So flavored and seasoned to perfection. The Oscar filet steak was like heaven on a plate!! If you love lobster mac & cheese this is the best place to eat."}
{"text":"I have never been to brunch at Capital Grille until this last Easter Sunday. I have definitely been to Capital Grille on many other occasions and they have always been Great with a Capital G. I booked my reservation through yelp and received a call the day before to confirm.  We were sat in the middle of the main floor and requested we be sat next to the window and they had zero problems accommodating us.  Capital Grille is a real deal 5 Star steak dining experience. For brunch they offered a pre-fixed menu $50 a person with an option for endless mimosas or Bellini for $15. We ordered the Steak and eggs which was cooked to perfection. If you go to Capital Grille and like steak it's definitely the way to go but if you are more of a pescatarian you can't go wrong eating at this place either. I always order the shrimp cocktail and lump crab cake as an appetizer they have other great appetizers tuna carpaccio steak tartar amazing salads and more. I top that off with the surf n turf with mashed potatoes.  The brunch menu was a treat since they aren't normally open for brunch but we ordered shrimp and grits along with the grill lobster on top of some delicious quiche yummmm! The lobster and shrimp portions were more than enough as I left very satisfied and full to say the least. Capital Grille you know I will be back.!"}
{"text":"I had the 22 oz porterhouse steak and every pc was so perfectly done throughput from first bite to last. Literally every bite I shook my head and said how good it was. Also got the lobster mac. Very rich and enough for 2 Extremely attentive wait staff kept us filled with drinks and bread on the table. Well done"}
{"text":"This was our 1st visit to Capital Grill, and wont' be out last.  We had made reservations and despite being about 5 mins late (construction had us turned around) we were greeted with a smile, our coats taken and promptly taken to our table.  Once we were seated we were greeted by Maria, who was our server for the evening.  She gave us suggestions for the menu and the drink specials.  She was attentive but not over bearing.  The food was just amazing too.  My husband and I each had a different cut of steak which were both cooked perfectly.  We also got the asparagus, which we both love, but the seasoning was not to our liking but it wasn't disgusting.  We did get the lobster mac and cheese which was some of the best mac and cheese that I have ever had.  It was super creamy and had a good amount of lobster in.  Over all our visit was great.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food... fantastic service....incredible wine... delicious desserts... enjoyable outdoor dining....not the current trend of an environment so loud that you can't talk to your dinner partners... did I mention the amazing food????   Truly a fabulous evening from start to finish!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for my girlfriends bday. they definitely exceeded my expectation. service was excellent. they ushered us to a booth with the table decorated. then they sat us down and put roses and 2 glasses of champagne for us. took a picture of us and put it on a card. i was taken back. now onto the food.  Wagyu Carpachio - awesome. thinly sliced and generous portions Lobster Bisque - lots of lobster in the soup. not as creamy as most would have it. ++ for me Shrimp Cocktail - got 5 shrimps. and they were big shrimps. very fresh and juicy. Sesame crusted Ahi Tuna. if you dont like sushi, dont try it. difficult to cook. tasted a little bland to me IMO.  Porterhouse_ excellent cut. nothing else needed on top of the steak. cooked perfectly.   Night ended with a complimentary chocolate cake. awesome cake!.  Thank you Capital Grille!"}
{"text":"Good food and great atmosphere. Bartenders are awesome. Great wine list. Had the scallops in risotto and it was enjoyable."}
{"text":"I received a gift card for Capital Grille, so we decided to stop in and eat at the bar last weekend.  What a great experience - less stuffy, great bartenders, and lively atmosphere!    I started with a nice glass of a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc (nice pour), had a delicious and large shrimp cocktail, a super tasty wedge salad and an apple crostada that was out of this world to round out my perfect meal.  We'll definitely repeat this night...perfection!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic and the service was excellent. I had the dry aged sirloin with steak frites and the steak was perfect. We were all asking ourselves when we last had anything so good. The fries were crispy and thin and perfectly salted. The dressing on the mixed green salad was bland but let's face it, you go there for the steak not the salad. I certainly can't afford to be a regular here but wonderful treat to enjoy from time to time!"}
{"text":"If you like a great steak, great service, and lots of options you will love this place!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now so I think I am able to give a good overview. Ironically, both times I had George as a waiter (a nice asian gentleman)...he is HILARIOUS, and a great waiter. So shout out to him.  Pros: Everyone is super friendly, accommodating, etc. PARMESAN TRUFFLE FRIES Great wine by the glass selection fast service Super nice waiters  room for improvement: I ordered my steak Med Rare and it was most certainly rare. VERY rare. (I know some people don't know what Med Rare, or Med, etc really means, but I do.) Wedge salad= waste of money. Not really good, bulky to cut/eat.   Overall, I will def come back, especially because it's super convenient for my client. I would expect a steak place to cook a steak to my requested temperature and if I had more time I would have probably sent it back to be cooked more."}
{"text":"I'm a little disappointed, it seems like I've eaten here before and it wasn't so bad.   The caesar salad dressing tasted mostly of mayo.  They cooked my medium steak pretty well, but turned out they had switched my friend's steak and mine and his was supposed to be medium rare.  I feel a steak restaurant should know how to cook a steak.  The mashed potatoes were lumpy.  They tasted ok, and did not feel pasty but could've used some kind of flavor.  The green beans were actually pretty good.  The salmon was cooked well but the citrus based sauce was a bit too sweet.  The sauce that came on the steaks was better, but didn't have much flavor.  The steaks themselves could've used a bit of salt and pepper.  The creme brulee was pretty tasty as always but I wasn't a fan of the flourless espresso chocolate cake.    All in all, I don't think the experience and food is as put together as their competitors.  The waitress also seemed a bit joyless which didn't help the experience.  With so many better options, I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.  Maybe for lunch?"}
{"text":"New year's dinner not perfect as was  all the other numerous times throughout the last 20 years. Restaurant called and we had a pleasant conversation and we were invited back to make everything perfect as always 5 star! PERFECT HANDLING OF A DINNER GONE BAD! Excellent perfect customer service. This will stay our number 1 go to restaurant for our special occasions as Nd our special visiting guests!"}
{"text":"Very expensive. You get what you pay for. Our special occasion restaurant in Scottsdale. Filet mignon perfect, fish excellent, appetizers and dessert and service excellent. Always a wonderful dinner experience"}
{"text":"We were craving a steak so stopped in for an early dinner at the bar. The bartender/server Jimmie was attentive, efficient, and helpful with menu recommendations. The food - a veal chop and the porcini rubbed rib eye - were quality and cooked perfectly as was the potatoes au gratin and the Caesar salad was flavorful after a string of bland ones elsewhere recently. The two martinis were great, too. Had enough leftover steak to add to a salad and some potatoes for another dinner eating in the next night. The dining room is a very attractive atmosphere and the bar very comfortable. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This review is for any chocolate fiend or dessert freaks like me. I live in LA and absolutely love the Chocolate Hazelnut Cake at the Capital Grille in West Hollywood. It is one of the best desserts I have ever had in a restaurant. Unfortunately the same dessert is horribly disappointing at this location. I couldn't finish it. It was just sweet without flavor and a chore to eat. Boo.  With so many other wonderful places to eat in Las Vegas, there is no reason for me to come here."}
{"text":"NOT THAT SPECIAL  for the insane prices I expected  insanely good food but no it was only OK, my husband's steak was  was just that and when they prepare it with peppercorn it is way overpowering  all you can taste is the pepper no meat, My  \"freshest sea food in AZ\"  was a little dry. all in all it was fine but not for the price we definitely  wont be going back"}
{"text":"My business colleagues and I stopped here for Dinner last night.  We arrived at 6 at got a great booth in the main dining room.  Since we are CG regulars, there was no need to look at the menu.  We ordered  Old Fashioned Whiskies, Filets, Creamed Corn and Coconut Cream Pies for Desert.   That was it........pure bliss!  This is another fabulous CG location.  The Decor, food and service was awesome as usual.  The Managing Partner Armin Ahrabin was a great host.  CG rocks in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here yesterday for dinner and ordered the french onion soup, rib-eye steak, creamed spinach, truffled fries.  The onion soup was strong with huge amounts of cheese.....great flavor except the soup was so hot that it burned my mouth:(  The steak was super, super tasty.  The fries and creamed spinach were super good...perfect sides!!  THE VIEW and furnished interior is OUTFUCKING STANDING..........!!  One of the most beautiful restauants that I have been in.....love the seats....love the sights of the strip!.  Very romantic....."}
{"text":"Because I usually go to the Capital grille in midtown New York, while visiting sin city I decided I wanted steak, but didn't feel like trying something new so we (my boyfriend and I ) came here. Porterhouse steak was everything just like back home. My bf got the lobster tails which he stated were huge, which to him was a good thing. We shared the mash potatoes (which was awesome), and asparagus (which lacked that crunch I prefer, but the flavor was cool). Their cheesecake is good too, but ruth Chris' cheesecake is still better. Service was good our waiter was very attentive, and polite, which seemed to be the vibe we received from pretty much everyone out in vegas. All in all a good experience."}
{"text":"We had our holiday lunch with the Capital Grill and from start to finish, the service and food was amazing! Joe and the other waiters were very nice and patient with our group, answered questions and provided excellent service. I had the lobster & crab burger, we had mashed potatoes & green beans family style and the green beans, delicious!  I absolutely saved room for dessert and it was well worth it. The cheesecake is one of my favorite desserts and one of the best I've had. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Had an awesome meal for two. Seafood platter is a great value. Added a mozzarella salad - made daily we're told. Great salad. Wine tasting going on with generous pours. I like this place and shocked it wasn't included in the \"100 best\" by Cleveland.com. Really makes me question the validity of the list."}
{"text":"All the Capital Grilles I've ever been to have been wonderful... but if you go to this location be sure to ask for Juan. He's behind the bar sometimes and occasionally out on the floor. Regardless, you want him to take care of you because he just gets it. He always puts the customer first and isn't fake while doing so.   His employment there is a perfect marriage of a tremendous server/bartender doing their all in an upscale venue.   Top notch."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Ribeye steak was just OK. Good service, although maître d' was not the most welcoming. VERY loud (guy in the) bar."}
{"text":"Wonderful ambiance, food and most importantly, staff. Although I'm most familiar with the DC and Baltimore locations thank you Lisa and your staff for a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"OK, 1st I knew what to expect price wise. I was going to order the Butter Poached Lobster and Tenderloin most expensive item on menu at $52, but the server gave the \"Specials\" 1st and one was \"Surf & Turf\" Tenderloin and Lobster tail. Since this was what I wanted to begin with I ordered it. What a surprise when I got the bill. $90.00 just for my plate. No questions the place is upscale, food is done just right and service is great but come on $90 for \"Surf & Turf\". I guess if I had to suggest anything if you want a QUIET dinner don't go here. Wide open room with tables and some booths. If I'm going to pay this price I'm sure I can find another location, same quality, same service, same food with more ambience for the price."}
{"text":"I was blown away by both the food and service at the Capital Grille. My boyfriend and I celebrated our anniversary here and they made it truly remarkable from heart confetti on the table to a hand written anniversary card. As soon as we were seated, we were treated with celebratory champagne. I had the Gorgonzola and truffle crusted dry aged ny strip and my boyfriend had the 24 oz. dry aged porterhouse. We shared the asparagus risotto (delicious) and the lobster mac & cheese (out of this world)! Our waiter, Alex, was very knowledgeable and extremely tentative throughout or evening. We ended our meal with a special complementary anniversary dessert. This was without a doubt the best dinning experience I have ever had!!"}
{"text":"Great job, Chuck our waiter gets it!  I had the bone in filet and Shelly had a wonderful salmon dish   As good a martini as I've had any where  Every dish was right on the money, highly recommend"}
{"text":"Absolutely delectable.   I was here with a reservation for someone's birthday and their treatment of the reservation and their thought and effort into decorating our table in advance was beyond great. The service was awesome as well.  I had the lobster bisque which is by far one of the best lobster bisques I've had to date as well as their New York cut steak and sauteed mushrooms. Definitely one of the better places in Las Vegas to visit for steak."}
{"text":"My favorite yelp event next to the Science Center event last year....and quite the opposite.  Very intimate feel, the whole dining area was opened up to make room for us and we were offered a cocktail/glass of wine upon entering. (Nice touch, makes me feel like I'm entering a \"Real Housewives of the Depths of Hell\" mansion party and I LOVED IT)   The wine was flowing and the food was fantastic! My better half and I enjoyed Crab Cake Sliders, Mini Tenderloin Sandwiches, JUMBO shrimp cocktail and wayyyyyyy to many little Coconut Cream pies. Those little pie babies were like heroin...and not that nasty black tar shit either, the good stuff.   It was nice to see the sweet as pie Gabi M., looking absolutely smashing for just having a baby by the way. Actually, she looked like a person that didn't just have a baby so kudos woman!!  The staff and service was outstanding. We had quite a few conversations with the staff  and Sommelier regarding the wine menu and events and they were all knowledgeable and incredibly polite without being obnoxiously formal. It appears that they have a good read on their clientele and that's a plus in my book. All class, no sass. This experience will definitely bring us back to The Capital Grille for drinks, lunch or dinner.   Had a blast  and I look forward to the next event!"}
{"text":"We visited CG recently for my husband's birthday and had a wonderful meal, top notch service and a really great time! The center of the table was dusted with birthday confetti when we arrived which was a nice touch. We started with a chopped salad which was the low point of the meal. It wasnt bad but it wasnt good either. I found myself jealous of the cesar salad that someone else had ordered because it looked much better. However, the rest of the meal was near perfect so let me move along. I decided to order a special- a filet topped with lumb crabmeat and red pepper hollandaise. WOW. It was so tasty! It was also smaller than the regular filet which turned out to be a good thing. We shared the au gratin potatos and the lobster mac and cheese and both were phenomenal! They were both very rich, and the potatoes were especially incredible. Even the sprinkling of crust on top tasted delicious!   For dessert we shared the flourless chocolate cake and the creme brulee. I have honestly never tasted better creme brulee in my life. It was perfect! The cake was good too, and I'm not even a chocolate person. Our server took a picture of us after dinner and printed it for us, which was a very sweet thing to do. Thanks Capital Grill, just give the chopped salad a makeover."}
{"text":"My first review was a 5, but after Del Friscos has entered the mix, and then returning here, I can't say they are on the same lever (other than price)."}
{"text":"We had a party of 11 during a big conference that had most of the strip restaurants booked during this time so we reserved a few weeks out.  The service was absolutely wonderful and the food was exceptional.  Most people in our party had steaks which they were all happy with.  We also ordered a number of side dishes-- 6 or so for the table, which were great for sharing.  I'm not that into French fries but theirs are something else-- the truffle oil takes them to a whole new world.  The lobster mac was also amazing.  I was one of the few who had fish (sea bass) and another person had the ahi.  Really good as well.  We had some wine (I didn't order it so not sure what) that was good with comparable prices to other nice restaurants.  Their deserts are not to be missed.  The coconut cream pie (not typically my go to) was deslish as was the flourless chocolate cake."}
{"text":"I would find it hard not to give The Capital Grille Five Stars, since they try so hard with their service. But it becomes so much easier when the food is delicious.  North Scottsdale is not at a loss for good steak places.  Morton's is down the street in Kierland Commons and I haven't even begun thinking about the various incarnations of Mastro's in the area.  The list goes on.  I arrived at about five fifteen on a Thursday night and had my choice of either sitting in the bar area, or in the formal restaurant.  I chose the bar since I spotted a Toronto-Philly game on the TV and I was by myself.  The bar area is separated by a small divider and has seating for about two dozen or so.  Given all the wood you would think it would be noisy, but it isn't.  The Capital Grille has that old Union League Club feel to it.  My choice turned into a good one.  While I was enjoying their flavorful Carpaccio (a drizzling of oil and lemon over the arugula and Wagyu beef) someone was seated at the table next to me.  My neighbor had just come from a round of golf and was also dining stag, since it was girl's night out for his wife.  He ordered the Cedar Plank Salmon with a side of mushrooms and I the 22 oz. Delmonico Steak (bone-in Rib Eye).    Most of their steaks are in the $41-42 price range, I believe the chicken is $37-ish.  This is inline with most other steakhouses.  And, as with most steak places, the entree didn't come with any sides.   Steak places usually price the sides in the $7.00 to $10.00 range.  At The Capital Grille the sides are all $10.00.  The choices range from several different kinds of spinach or potatoes, along with some interesting items like Lobster Mac 'n Cheese and Creamed Corn with Bacon.  I decided to keep it simple and went with just the steak.  If you grill at home, you know you can marinate your meat or use a dry rub of some kind.  From my years in Chicago, I've become a big fan of the various rubs.  Overnight seems to produce the best results.  Here the rub is applied and cooked over a hot grill.  This method allows for the searing in of the outer part of the meat thus keeping in the flavor.  Weber Grill on State Street does the same thing.  I ordered my meat medium, which means medium rare everywhere else.  After finishing my carpaccio, the wait was about ten minutes or so.  I just love it!   Just as you start thinking of your meal, the wait staff appears with your steak knife, and you think...  it won't be long now.  It's almost Pavlovian!  Well, the Delmonico steak arrived and it didn't disappoint.  It was huge and seemed larger then the advertised 22 oz.  There was a little au jus on the plate.  They didn't offer any steak sauce and I didn't ask.  The meat was cooked to order and I used the au jus for dipping.  It was delicious.  Was it the best I ever had?  Well I would say it's was up there.  Maybe not Gene & Georgetti and Peter Luger-ish, but it was good!  My neighbor offered me a taste of his Salmon, I reluctantly offered him some of my steak.  The salmon was moist and not dry.  I'm normally not a big fresh water salmon fan.  I much prefer the salt water steelhead.  But his was good, too.  The damage came to $69 or so, before tip.  The service was impeccable and the Chef came around and visited us during our meal.  I had a nice conversation with him and found that he had started  with The Capital Grille in Denver and was with them for over ten years.  Nice touch!  BTW, The Capital Grille has just started offering a fixed $15.00 lunch menu.  So, I will be back.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Oysters and shrimp where great worth the money but the meat not worth it better meat elsewhere"}
{"text":"Excellent experience! Brandon took really great care of us. Capital Grille has always been a place I wanted to try and thanks to Restaurant Week, I did. My whole family did. The porcini rub on any steak is amazing! Sam's mashed potatoes was divine. I wish we could have taken a to go.  Tuna tartare, if you like sashimi it's an appetizer must. Always have to try lobster Mac n' cheese wherever I go....this was very good too. Its good to share with a friend or two. The flourless espresso cake was also very yummy. It is dark chocolate and heavenly. Creme Brûlée was classy and done right. Cocktails were also awesome. Bohemian was sweet and bubbly. Capital cosmo hit the right spot and the French 75 was also very pleasing. Thanks for the champagne, Brandon."}
{"text":"Had Mother's Day brunch!  Outstanding Lobster Frittata, excellent smoked salmon, delicious steak and mashed potatoes!!  Bottomless champagne and their fabulous cream brûlée! Joe Geppi was our server, and he is Fabulous!!!"}
{"text":"Worst meal iv ever had.  I could have gotten a better cooked steak at chilis.  For a medium cooked steak I got a charred steak with a raw center.  We also ordered a gorgonzola topped steak which was the worst we have ever had , a steak we order quite often at mastros, Flemings etc...it was so bad we sent it back and the waitress told us this steak is for everyone.  The only thing that tasted above avg was the lobster bisque.  Even their sides lobster Mac and cheese and creamed spinach were hard to take down.    Iv bee to Capitol grill off camelback several times and it had never been even close to the horrific meal.  So make the drive across town if you really want to eat here or better yet just go to somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of steakhouses and I must say the capital grille is hands down the best steak in the U.S.   There service is always impeccable.  Everything about the experience is top notch.  I always recommend them to everyone I know."}
{"text":"Truly Excellent.  We had had a great meal and adventure (celebrities) in the  Washington DC location, so when we saw one in Scottsdale, we selected it.  What  a super place.  Great ambience...paintings of local prominent people highlighted an elegant setting.  We just wanted a light dinner so selected  the cold seafood platter: 1lb lobster, 6 prawns and 6 fresh oysters.  We substituted fresh lump crab (you only have to ask) for the oysters.  After a spit wedge, it was just right. By the way, fresh, cold crisp lettuce, and good blue cheese dressing.  Nicely done.  We are from Cape Cod so we know lobster.  Perfectly cooked, so someone is watching.  Prawns and crab also correctly cooked and chilled.  Our friends split the bone in filet that was perfectly done.  The wine list was extensive and actually underpriced for the haughty Scottsdale area.  The least expensive Moet & Chardon Imperial anywhere.  Great Service with an attentive manager  that knew the food and the restaurant's history.  A must destination for a great dinner."}

{"text":"Went there the other night and we also had the waiter from hell....he was inattentive the whole evening. We had to ask other waiters to help us. The list could go on of all the things he didn't do...moreover...The Filet Mignon was dry and  the bone in steak that my husband had was tasteless. We have been there several times over the years and never had a bad experience...but this time it was enough to not go back or recommend it to our friends."}
{"text":"There is not much at fault with The Capital Grille and this location, in particular. The ambiance is great, the location ideal, and the food and service are, well, ok. To be brutally honest, I've only dined at a Darden restaurant twice in the past few years, and when my experience concluded, I understood why I won't again--there are better steakhouses in the Valley that out-compete The Capital Grille.  The experience wasn't as crisp and exacting as it should be for a higher-end restaurant. With the prices and reputation The Capital Grille has garnered since first opening its doors in 1990, my minimum expectation is perfection. Anything above perfection earns my loyalty.   We waited a bit too long for our table at 8:30 on a Saturday night, and we would have enjoyed sitting on the patio, but the offer wasn't extended. The restaurant didn't appear to be too busy as there were plenty of open tables, and I doubt there were many reservations after us, so why make your guests wait? Is the need to convenience your staff more important than to convenience your patrons? Food for thought.   Again, the fifteen minute wait for our bottle of Malbec to hit the table was just unnecessary. Maybe they had to stomp some grapes in the back. Maybe there's a lack of urgency. Whatever it is, it detracts from the experience.   The bone-in sirloin left much to be desired. Though cooked properly, the lack of seasoning and flavor were disappointing. Why I ordered a sirloin, I do not know. I think my mind saw 'bone-in' and equivocated it with a rib-eye. I had a couple bites of my girlfriend's filet, which was excellent.   In conclusion, if you have money for the finer things in life, go with the finest. Steak 44, Mastro's, and J&G can help you with that."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my wife and was looking forward to a good meal. Wonderful seating in a private booth and nice greeting when you sit down. Ordered French onion soup and cheese was so burnt I could not eat it as it tasted terrible. I wonder why a chef would prepare then serve, as well as why it would be allowed to leave kitchen. Also wondered why server would take it to the table. Wife ordered swordfish and it was literally raw. Had to send that back as well. This is not the way to have a nice meal by eating while the other person waits for the corrected meal. Prices are high which is fine, but then so should food standards. We have eaten here before and someday may again but for now no hurry to return."}
{"text":"Where do I start, I love this place the food is so good!! I have had fish, steak, lobster...etc here and it all has been on point! The Brussels sprouts salad is so delicious and the service is impeccable I have a very picky child and they service her to the \"spoiled zone\" lol  There dessert menu could be a little bigger but who cares, I do love the seasonal berries and cream dessert after a big fatty meal . Great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great fine dining steak house. The ambience is reminiscent of an old fashioned steak and seafood establishment with dark interior and rich fixtures. The staff operates with a high level of customer service driven ethic. They truly want you to enjoy your meal and  your experience is their focus. The steaks are amazing, cooked to perfection. Should you ever encounter an issue with the preparation of your food, it is readily rectified by the executive chef who will personally make sure you are satisfied with your meal. Great food, exquisite service."}
{"text":"Dined here on a Thursday night and we were sat at a lovely table by the window. The steak tartare and calamari were delicious, and they were big portions too. For our main course, one other and myself decided to split a steak and scallops dish, and they were nice enough to split it for us so we didn't have to do any work. The scallops were amazing; very fresh tasting and flavorful and came with a parsnip purée, mushrooms and asparagus. The Gorgonzola and truffle bone in NY was delicious as well, although I could barely taste the truffle, but I didn't mind as the steak was still great and prepared really well. The lobster mac and cheese and parm truffle fries were really good, but I would skip the brussel sprouts. They were just okay. Everyone else enjoyed their meals. We split the coconut creme pie for dessert and that was amazing. I would recommend it 100%.   I knocked off one star because our waiter, Alex, seemed very grumpy and demanded everything from our drinks down to our desserts. I understand that may be his personality and some people may like that, but gauge your guests. He was just not polite and put us all off a bit.   Overall, we had a good time and would come back for the food and ambience. Not so much the service."}
{"text":"I would like to give a shout out to Jimmy the bartender for his phenomenal service! I too am in the service industry and really appreciate when someone goes the extra mile for me!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a birthday lunch because it was the only \"high class\" restaurant that was open for lunch. I had the filet and it would have been fine if they had not put the steak on top of a Nasty beef broth. I had asparegus which seemed undercooked. The schrimp cocktail was descent and the creme brûlée was also descent. This place is no where close to Durnats or Ruth Chris. Definitely not worth the $70 including tip."}
{"text":"Top notch food and top notch service.  That is what you get at Capital Grille.  A few notes:  * The shrimp cocktail sauce lacks the kick of Mastro's \"atomic\" horseradish sauce and is blahhhhhhhh.  * I ordered the Delmonico steak which was awesome but I should not have gotten the porcini sauce/rub because I don't think balsamic vinegar belongs anywhere near a steak IMHO.  * Au Gratin potatoes had a wee too much garlic  * Lobster mac n' cheese = PHENOMENAL  Anyway, I wish I could eat here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day if money or having a heart attack wasn't an issue."}
{"text":"Went last Thursday for restaurant week.  Claim chowder...perfect.   Creme brûlée...perfect.   Sirloin special....grissely and disappointing.   My guest got the same and got the same grissely disappointment.    Atmosphere was nice and service was excellent."}
{"text":"We arrived a few minutes late (but called to give them a heads up) and apparently that meant waiting an extensive amount of time to be seated. Granted, I know how annoying it is not to be punctual, but it seemed a little excessive.  Steaks all arrived in the wrong temperature. Either undercooked or overcooked. Also, the tuna steaks had been seared (and in one case, completely cooked through) when the request was for them to be raw. Honestly, I don't know that any one out of our group of eight had one dish right.  The server was nice, and our table was a prime people watching spot.   I'd give them points on the desserts, the lobster mac n cheese and the Malbec.   But for the price, my expectations were high."}
{"text":"It's good. Had lobster soup first so later the sea bass didn't taste that great. But I had it packed and ate the rest in the next day, it was soooooooo good!"}
{"text":"BEST steakhouse I've ever been to. Fantastic service and AWESOME food! Steaks are phenomenal! Well worth every cent! George Lee has got to be the greatest server on the face of this earth!"}
{"text":"Attended last weeks deep pour opening event w several friends. A fantastic event!! The food was fantastic!! We ordered a wide variety of food including, bone in filets, king crab legs, halibut, and DELICIOUS LOBSTER MAC AND CHEESE!! The wines were both diverse and delicious. The pours were basically unlimited and well worth the additional $28 for each participating person. This particular RESTARAUNT is very well appointed and a pleasure to dine at! Our server was fantastic. Very attentive and extremely knowledgable about ALL THE WINES and of course each item on the menu. The only thing that keeps this dinner from being a perfect 10 was a strange item I found in my mushrooms!! I was eating them with my steak when I suddenly bit down on a hard object! Upon further inspection it appeared to be a piece of wood!!! Because my party was having a great time, I put it on the side until dinner was finished and discretely gave to our server to let the chef know of my discovery. As it so happens , one other guest also had s piece of wood in their food! Quickly the manager made his way to our table to inquire about what happened. We relayed the story and he said this happens often!!?? It has something to do with their mushroom vendor. Having had other items in my food experiences , I was interested in how this would be handled. Well his response was to ask if everything was alright and when we said yes he left! This was a first for me! NEVER have I had an experience in a high end restaurant, where the manager did not offer to buy us a desert or some similar token of apology!! Never mind that we were spending $700 + on dinner!! I eat at this eatery pretty regularly and this was just plain POOR management judgement! I have had ENTIRE meals comped for a single MYSTERY item on a plate , let alone two diners with the same experience! Despite this,the night was a rousing fun time!! Truly a missed opportunity for this manager  and the CAPITAL GRILLE CHAIN!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I had an amazing dinner. The food was delicious and our waiter Chuck was extremely helpful and accommodating. All in all it was a great start to an awesome night."}
{"text":"First let me start by saying the service was impeccable. Very attentive to refilling water, keeping bread on the table, checking in frequently. My main issue was with my entrée and went for lunch I ordered the Burrata salad which was under the salad section. This was not a salad at all, basically a burrata appetizer. Not nearly enough for lunch and definitely not a salad, it's a piece of burrata cheese, poached pears a piece of prosciutto and two very thin crostini's. I think this could easily be solved by just removing this from the salad menu and putting it under appetizers. Otherwise it was a nice restaurant."}
{"text":"The service was good and wait staff was very friendly so no complaints there.  However, if we really want to look critically at the Capital Grille I'm not so convinced I'll be back.  Very simple menu - which is good - but the prices are about 20% higher than they really need to be.  I had the dry aged new york strip and it was good, but it wasn't $46 good.  My girlfriend had the 10oz filet but it was dry (prepared medium) which is inexcusable for a place charging this much money.  Au Gratin Potatoes were good and we shared them as a side and the lobster bisque was also good.  I don't think this is a bad place to eat but the one thing I was missing was value.  If you need to impress someone just baed on how much money you can spend go ahead and go here but my meal at Rooster's was much better for less money. Just seems like there are some artificially inflated prices."}
{"text":"The Capital Grille is solid.  It has a more upscale feel then some other high end chain restaurants. The drinks are awesome and the food came out perfect.  From oysters, to bomb ass lobsters this place is pretty legit. Personally, I think the steaks were just a tiny bit above average.  Better than Fleming's, but not as good as Sullivan's. This is a great place for a date or a business dinner."}
{"text":"Have been here 3-4 times and it never disappoints.   I always usually go with the special or whatever the staff recommends that night, which has traditionally been steak. I have had a couple really well cooked steaks from The Capital Grille.   The prices are expensive and you can pretty much assume that you will be paying $100/person easy after drinks and an appetizer or desert. It is however very very good.   If you are in town do your self a favor and go grab a steak here."}
{"text":"I didnt order much, just two entrees and a side, but I can say my steaks were cooked perfectly. The service was friendly and the food was good. Very nice ambience. I would return."}
{"text":"Best steaks ever!! The best service ever!! The beat cheesecake I really liked this place the only little thing that bothered me was how rude two of the bartenders were but the rest of the staff great"}
{"text":"The best part about this place is the Truffle fries.. the steak was standard.. the Lobster was okay.. the dips.. were sub-standard.... it's not really worth it.. not coming back here anytime soon.. dont get me wrong the Truffle fries was delicious...but do you really wan't to patron a restaurant where it's best item on the menu is Fries?"}
{"text":"I came with my husband to his company's holiday lunch today. The drinks were great, but a better majority of our steaks were not cooked correctly. After spending several hundred dollars we were disappointed, but my husband and his staff were too sweet to say anything and simply ate parts of their meal and left the rest. For such quality food this was unexpected and very disappointing. Would love the opportunity to see if this was a rare thing or usual occurrence as he has many company outings and spends a great deal on his staff and clients."}
{"text":"There is no doubt in my mind that these Elite events are getting better and better. I can't even count the amount of times that the staff wanted to make sure that I was taken care of (even though I was clearly helping photograph the event). Every employee seemed to have woken up on the right side of their beds today.   Service aside, the food was wonderful and came out in fresh batches. I have three favorites...the tenderloin slider, the crab slider, and the coconut cream pie bites. To be absolutely redundant, the tenderloin slider was beautifully tender. It was almost like biting into butter (but not really...that's gross), and for a slider, had a generous helping of meat on it. The crab & lobster sliders were also delicious. They were salty, and buttery with a great slightly crunchy bun. It seemed like the bun was just slightly toasted so it added just a little bit of texture. Wrapping up my favorites were the dangerously tasty pie bites. I could have eaten a whole tray of them. They were definitely some of the better coconut pie creations that I've had.  Capital Grill is among the most generous of hosts for an Elite event. Thank you as always to every person involved. Also, it was great getting to see all of the Eiltes today. I had a good time chatting with a few of you, and I can't wait to see you soon!  ***Flickr Pics***  http://www.flickr.com/photos/yelp/sets/72157629092996001/"}
{"text":"I was trying to find an email address to send a complaint to the manager. But this is unfortunately not something that is made available on the website. So I guess I'll just have to write it here instead. I visited Las Vegas last year for thanksgiving with two friends and we had a really great dinner at Capital Grille. There was a mixup with the wine but it was all sorted out.  Therefore we also made a reservation a month a head when we returned last week celebrating my birthday and were very excited about it. We came a little early so our table weren't ready - fair enough. But then after waiting 20 min later than we book for we were seated in between the storage room and the restroom in an annex to the bar with televisions running and cellphones ringing off the hook. Not at all the atmosphere we experienced last time or what the prices reflects. The waiter was not bad but was not very attentive probably because we were so remote from the actual dinning hall. Ordering over a month ahead this is unacceptable. Then they need to limit the amount they are taking in instead! Also we again had issues with the wine,but this time it wasn't sorted out. So I had an undrinkable Riesling that I still paid for. When we were paying the waiter was very focused on getting her 15 % tips. I know that tips are almost mandatory in the us in contrary to where we from, and I don't mind paying them. But I still prefer that you still feel like it voluntary. I'm sorry because last year it was really great but this was my last time at capital grille."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in the one thing I really wanted to try here which was the Coconut Cream Pie. I visited this location just to try it out and was saddened by what was served. While the presentation was nice and the whip cream very tasty there was way more whip creme then there should have been for the size of the pie. The actual pie portion was about 5 inches round and the filling about 1 inch thick. However the whip creme was about 4 inches high. While the presentation was nice the ratio was all off and it ended up being a whip creme pie. I can appreciate that the chef wanted to make the dessert his own this was a miss in my opinion. The service was great for the most part although getting the check did take some time."}
{"text":"Capital Grille is consistently very good. It's this consistency that brings me back.   I've dined at many Capital Grilles in different cities, and they never let me down.   The steaks are top notch and always cooked to proper temperature. Medium is pink in the center, as expected. The meat always arrives very hot, as if it's straight off the grille (out, hot from the oven), which I really appreciate.   Sides are typical of a high-end steak house: potatoes several ways, some green vegetables, all served with enough for 2-3 to share.  Table bread is very good; don't miss the brown raisin bread, it's excellent.   Salads and deserts are also pretty standard fare for a good, old-school steak house. The wine list is vast.   But the SERVICE is impeccable. Servers are professional but warm, and they know all the specials and all the menu items. There are others who keep the drinks filled frequently.   So, yes, I highly recommend this Capital Grille location.   One final tip:  just valet park. You won't find anything better."}
{"text":"Yes, it's a chain. But man, is it incredible! The amazing Jonathan D. took me to TCG for a birthday lunch today where I enjoyed their combo lunch of Butternut Squash Bisque, Lobster Roll and Parmesan/Truffle Fries. He had the Wagyu Mushroom burger and seemed very pleased with it. For ~$20/each it truly doesn't get any better. In addition, the pre-meal bread was so fresh out of the oven, it was actually too hot to touch. Our server Tina noticed that I opened a gift before the meal, assumed it was my birthday, and provided us with dessert afterwards. What service!!! True - it isn't for everyday meals, but I say a special occasion can be a random Tuesday, so treat yourself!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. My father took me there for my birthday. When we got there (15 minutes early) the table was already set and waiting for us. The staff had showered the table with little happy birthday decorations. Thought it was a nice touch. Above and beyond that, The waitstaff was extremely professional and timely. There was always someone to refill my glass of water whenever it was halfway low. The recommendations from the server were on point, and I think we only waited about 15 minutes from the point of ordering till our food arrived at our table. The glazed salmon was amazing, and although you must order sides al a carte, the portions are pretty large. The restaurant general manager came over to wish me a happy birthday, and at the end of the night the server offered to take a group picture for us. I genuinely have nothing negative to say about this dining experience! Service was amazing, food was delicious, and the restaurant inside is beautiful."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!!! Knocked my socks off over and over again.  We had dinner here for our anniversary, first visit.  This place is above five stars.  We arrived a few min before our reservation and were immediately seated.  The restaurant is old school steak house.  Dark woods, red leather seats, huge paintings and also animal heads on the walls, I do not like that but I get that it goes with the decor.  Lighting is dim but not so much you can not see around the room but if you eyes are as bad as ours you may need a little flash light to read the menu. Service was perfect, not a single flaw.  If a waiter could win a academy award, then our server Chris Phillips would win. We started with the lump crab cocktail.  We are from the Pacific Northwest and very picky with AZ seafood.  The crab was moist and sweet and came with a delish sauce, I could of ate that all day.  Also the lobster bisque.  Best lobster bisque I ever had was at Salty's in WA and this is a competitor of theirs, fantastic! large lumps of lobster and absolutely amazing.  My husband had the porter house steak, amazing.  Perfectly cooked with a bit of a \"cooked over a charcoal bbq\" flavor.   I had the tenderloin with lobster tail and lobster butter sauce.  I could live in this dish.  Amazing!!!! At the end of this amazing meal we were treated with champagne and desert,  A fantastic chocolate cake with fresh real whip cream and amazing cheese cake with fresh berries. This has become my favorite restaurant in AZ hands down.  Can not wait to eat here again and again and again."}
{"text":"We visited the Capital Grille on our recent visit to Las Vegas.  This was our 4th visit and as always, we had a fabulous meal.  However, the best thing about the evening was our server, Stephanie, who gave us outstanding service.  She was attentive without being overbearing and provided us with everything possible in order for us to have a special night.  Stephanie was fun and personable and helped to make it a memorable evening."}
{"text":"I came here for a first date, and now this is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. The ambiance was perfect for the occasion. Our waiter was on point with his timing too! He only showed up at the best times and the food was rolled out in the same fashion. We started with calamari and a bottle of wine. The wine list is extensive. I was very impressed with the quality options. I ordered the filet mignon, and it was cooked perfectly (medium rare plus). We shared the lobster Mac and cheese, which was buttery, creamy, and delicious. We also shared the Brussels sprouts... so good and they were cooked with bacon. The dessert menu did have some great options, but I was stuffed by the end of the meal. I'm happy to know that this is actually a chain and can be found in many major cities."}
{"text":"Love Capital Grille and never had a problem there in the past but last night had the waiter from hell. Didn't know what Hendricks gin was. When we ordered wanted our steak pink and it came out well done. He kept saying medium well and I said NO!  Ordered a second round of drinks and he forgot to bring them to the table.   This is not the CG I've been going to for years. Chalk it off to a bad experience but hope they fired the waiter. For these prices expected a lot better experience."}
{"text":"Our waiter must have been on drugs. Asked for our steak pink and he kept saying medium well. Needless to say it came out medium well. We ordered a second round of drinks that he never delivered. Had to get the manager to get them from the bar.  This is really unusual for Capital Grille as we never had bad service or food there before. Probably won't go back as I hate to waste my money being that both food and service have gone so far downhill."}
{"text":"Took my husband here for his bday sometime in the beginning of November. I told then ahead of time that it was his birthday and the did really special things. It was expensive but he was happy the food was great and free v parking. Not bad at all would do it again. He says this place has the best steak. We even got a picture to take home."}
{"text":"I have had a few great experiences here. Both have been for work events so it was a large group and each time the service and food have been excellent. The kona steak is my favorite - the crust gives it great flavor. The steak has always been cooked properly. I enjoy the bread basket as it has a few different options to choose from. The mashed potatoes are very good as well. For dessert, I typically get the cheesecake which is excellent. Capital grille is in my top two for favorite steak places in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I really love this Capital Grille! This location at Biltmore has always been spot on. Made a reservation for our anniversary here the night before Valentines Day. We arrived about 10 minutes early and our car service was met with awesome valet guys. We sat at the bar and had pre-dinner cocktails. I've always been treated so well at this particular Capital Grille from valet to valet. I love that when your table is ready they take your tab and your drink for you to your table. This night was our anniversary of a year and our table had rose petals scattered all over it. How nice is that?! We started with a seafood tower. It's our one year and hey, relationships these days that last, deserve pomp and treats! Well.. We like bubbles and food! This seafood tower was divine and we aren't large people; as soon as it arrived, I knew we were in over our heads! Oh well, you only live once .. Spend well! Next we both ordered the filet mignons. My go to steak. I know they do it right and perfect it was this night. We opted for the mashed potatoes and a salad, as well. I think we both had two bites and were stuffed! Our waiter was spot on perfect. So friendly, you can see why Capital Grille is one of the top notch steak houses. He suggested the perfect merlot to pair our filet with and even brought us a complimentary vodka Stoli vanilla cream cordial after dinner drink, just because! As if we weren't stuffed enough and had not been spoiled by the staff enough on our special night, out comes a dessert tray with a chocolate cursive writing of, ' Happy Anniversary!', around several small dessert samplings. So wonderful! I love a classy restaurant like this that loves it's customers and shows it this way. It's a splurge and it's worth it, every single time! Oh.. We even got two little truffles in a cute little Capital Grille box to take home :-)"}
{"text":"My family and I had our first night of restaurant week at capital grill. My wife and daughter both ordered the filet mignon medium rare and I ordered the dry aged NY strip medium. All were cooked perfectly and paired with green beans and tomatoes and mashed potatoes. Atmosphere was very nice and well maintained. Staff was very pleasant and welcoming. The food overall was terrific. I personally did not care for the green beans and wish asparagus was paired with the meal instead. For desert I had the espresso cake and they ordered the creme brûlée. The cake in my opinion was much better than the pudding. I tried the pudding and was disappointed that it was not warm. I have had creme brûlée heated before from other restaurants and it's much better heated. We looked at the traditional menu and saw an excellent selection. Everything looked delicious. However the prices are startling. You can get similar quality and service for 15% cheaper at other restaurants. They are definitely worth trying but be prepared to have a nice chunk of cash to spend."}
{"text":"Capital Grille is now one of my new favorite steakhouses hands down. It's upscale elegant style and decor will impress you as you are dazzled by an enchanting birds eye view of The World Famous Las Vegas Strip. The Porcini bone-in ribeye is the way to go. It's a 15-year aged balsamic steak with a delicate porcini mushroom crust. Cooked to perfection ...with each tender bite you're chewing paradise. Pair the Porcini with some of its friends like roasted fingerling potatoes or grilled asparagus with lemon mosto and now it's a party! The clam chowder or Caesar salad are both great starters as well. The deserts are decadent & delicious! The entire staff took care of us all night with prompt, courteous service... and our server was excellent, giving us great recommendations along with exceptional customer service. If you're going to hit Vegas anytime soon....put The Capital Grille on your Vegas bucket list because this place is operating at a championship level."}
{"text":"best of the CG's I've been to service is outstanding as are all the entrees we've had here.  Came 2 nights in a row on this last trip.  Killer views of the strip and very romantic.  Chopped salad is my favorite anywhere.  Cheesecake is to die for."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here last night to celebrate his birthday and had a fabulous dining experience!  Our server Chris was very friendly and quick on response.  We were greeted with a decorated table and card which was such a nice surprise.  We ordered oysters on a half shell for an appetizer which were served with a couple of sauces...they were delicious.  For our entrees we chose the Delmonico Ribeye and the Fillet Oscar.  We shared both and I was amazed at how delicious everything was.  We also had the truffle fries which were a wonderful compliment to our steak meals. Our dinner was completed with a gorgeous dessert platter which was the highlight of our meal.  The cheesecake was the best cheesecake I have ever had....it was truly amazing!!!  When we left we even got a keepsake picture that was taken of us during our dinner. :)   We have eaten at several other local fine dining establishments that were great but we were extremely impressed with the food and staff at Capital Grille Scottsdale!  So glad we celebrated my husband's birthday with them!"}
{"text":"Have you ever finished dinner and immediately started fantasizing about eating it all over again? Yeah, me neither. But if I ever did, this would be the one.  Food: Beyond Excellent! I immediately had my eye on the 10 oz. Filet Mignon steak and ordered one cooked medium. Our waitress recommended various marinades and rubs, but the Kona coffee with shallot butter one piqued my interest. Well, it turned out to be \"I'm going to chew each and every bite of this ever so slowly so this lasts forever\" kinda delicious, tender and juicy.  We also all shared an order of the Lobster Mac 'N' Cheese, which was one of the best side dishes I've eaten in a long time. I probably could have just eaten a couple bowls of this and been happy the rest of the night. Dessert was Creme Brulee topped with blueberries, strawberries, raspberries and blackberries. Words cannot express what a delightful epilogue this was to the entire meal.  Service: Top-notch! Our waitress was over-the-top friendly. Although slightly animated, she was knowledgeable, prompt, friendly and resourceful the entire time. Our water glasses never dipped below half-full and she even comped one of our desserts and our post-dinner coffees. Granted, it's not a huge deal for what you pay for all the entrees and drinks (the wine list is longer than the menu), but it was not required, but much appreciated.  The good news is there are Capital Grille's all over the U.S. So, if you're smart, you'll make a reservation, throw on something nice, grab your wallet (fa sho) and enjoy a wonderful evening of wining and dining in style."}
{"text":"[Restaurant Week]  The service left me wanting for more. I didn't care for the decor Grand Manner slavery era portraits adorned the walls along with stuffed deer heads. I felt uncomfortable.    My steak had to be refired. Our bread was late to the table. The waiter complained about how many people were going to be coming through the restaurant for lunch.    The whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth. How many Steak resultants does one downtown need?"}
{"text":"I went here on Friday after hearing for years how amazing it was. I was not overly impressed,  mostly because the menu was not that exciting. The salad I had was amazing - it had pears, spiced nuts and bibb lettuce. I then ordered the tenderloin sliders...they were good, but nothing mind blowing.  Here is where they lost me...expensive truffle fries that weren't anything special.  Also, our waitress seemed overwhelmed and wasn't overly friendly.  Overall,  it was a good meal, but not worth the price."}
{"text":"We came here for mothers day. First off, our waiter, Justin, was hands down the most amazing server ever. Very personable and never a moment he didnt have a smile on his face. Im a server myself and this is the type of server i strive to be like. Secondly, our food, we all had the brunch special, filet mignon, it was cooked to perfection and the mashed potatoes with it were to die for. Sadly they ran out of creme brulee but he gave us the option to order anything off the regular dessert menu so we tried the cheesecake. It was delicious. And to top it all off. They were giving all the mothers a free certificate to pick out a necklace or earrings at Kendra Scott. My mother got a free $90 dollar necklace. Good job Capital Grille. We will for sure be back and will definitely be requesting Justin to serve us again."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. Bar side service is exceptional especially with Oscar on duty- a real pro!   Brian the GM runs a tight ship and trains and hires good people - highly recommend.  My favorite dishes are the crab Louie salad or the Caesar salad with anchovies.  Dinner the scallop are Devine and hard to beat the ribeye."}
{"text":"Being from out of town, I found myself a bit underdressed for the Capital Grille but none the less was served as if I was dressed to the nine's. The service here is impeccable and done mostly with a smile. My waiter was a bit too serious for his own good but everyone else was lovely.    Food wise, oh my, my, MY! Yum! I had the 14 oz. Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin - with shallot butter, which was far more steak then I'd normally ever have in one sitting but wow! It was so good I couldn't even leave a bite left on my plate. Cooked to perfection the meat with sharper taste of the shallot butter just melted in my mouth. It cames with the Sam's Mashed Potatoes & Fresh Creamed Spinach.  The potatoes were really tasty but the spinach I could've done without. This is easily enough food for two!  Ordered a Stoli Doli to go with my meal. It's the signature drink at Capital Grille and definitely worth having more than once.   And the Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake! Oh the cake... If people could live without sex by eating this cake, they'd be fat on flavor and taste of this amazing cake. By far one of the best flourless cakes I've ever had, rich in flavor, with the consistency of fudge."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?! This place has the most amazing lobster Mac n cheese IN THE WORLD. Honestly I don't think I've ever tasted anything, in my life, that tastes this good. It's just unbelievable. You cannot live one more day without trying this. Please go. I just want you to be happy so go eat the best Mac n cheese ever. PS- everything else is delish here too. Perfection- this place is perfection."}
{"text":"I love the Capital Grille, I love the Dining after Dark special offered by Capital Grille in the sumertime even more. The deals offered if you eat after eight at night any night of the week during the summer are mind boggling. The food is excellent, the service is even better. The Capital Grille's server named Sergio delivers a first class expierence to a tee. I would highly recomend requesting him if you decide to eat here for a special occasion."}
{"text":"YUM!  Writing this review makes me want to go back right now!!!  May I suggest you begin your meal with their signature drink?  It's called a \"stole-doli\" and its addictive!  It is served in a chilled martini glass.  It is pineapple infused vodka.  If you enjoy fresh seafood I highly recommend you order their seafood plateau.  It is in one word, INCREDIBLE!  Worth every $$$ you spend.  Great wine selection and amazing steaks.  The kona crusted steak is killer.  The fish is good too.  Ask for a window seat that faces the strip."}
{"text":"For a special evening out I made reservations at the capital grill as it was a close walk to the Venus for out after dinner plans.  I was not disappointed at all.  Everything from the wait staff to the food was excellent.  I got the 10 oz filet and it was good but I honestly enjoyed some of the other items I ordered more.  The white cheddar potato soup was such a comfort like soup.  I wish I could have that allllll the time.  We also got the Brussels sprouts as a side and they were outstanding.  It is pricey for the average person so there is no way I could afford to go often but for the \"special occasions\" I will return for sure."}
{"text":"We had a wine pairing meal here last evening with four couples. What an amazing experience! The food and wine were absolutely delectable and paired with perfection! The service from start to finish was awesome! We are so grateful for such a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"As far as a LUNCH goes, this is THE BEST lunch I've had in Charlotte since I came here in 2011! OK it's NOT cheap! That is a given. But I got the Ribeye Steak Sandwich with Havarti, Carmelized Onions and Parmesean Truffle Fries. As the pictures show, this was one hell of a \"sandwich!\" It was about a 12oz STEAK sandwiched in between 2 pieces of bread. UBER flavorful, thick, juicy and prepared perfectly Med/Medium Rare. I struggled to stay awake at my desk after lunch but this was OH SO good! I mean, SUPERBLY good! And it cost $24 with tip, but well worth it!  My lunch buddy got their cheeseburger, and that also was DELICIOUS! It had to be at least 10oz, bigger than most, and completely covered in cheese.  So if you want to splurge on a great lunch, this is THE place to come! Just bring a high limit credit card! Hey like I say, you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Capital Grill Rocks  Capital grill is great as always fantastic food, great service, wonderful patio too for patio dining in the winter in AZ. They have a deep cellar of wines and a wonderful GM - Brian Schwartztrauber & Executive Chef - Travis. Love the steaks and the lobster bisque is to die for. Both my spouse & I love the fantastic bread basket it is wonderful European breads. If you have a special meal Capital Grill is the place to go, great table setups for that special event like birthdays, anniversary's !  The water is never empty, The Glass of Wine & Wagyu Burger offer is great at $25. Their Kona rubbed beaf is killer, get the truffle fries they are to die for!  Capital Grill Scottsdale Location is type of restaurant you will Love!"}
{"text":"The Capital Grille is a steakhouse with superb service, a great wine list and excellent food.  I've eaten there about 3 times and have experienced wonderful food and extraordinary service.  The decor is very gentleman's club and over the top masculine.  I particularly like the Lobster Mac 'n' Cheese, which is gourmet comfort food.  Their wine list is heavy on the reds, and their strength is American wines.  I believe they have an extensive collection of over 2,000 bottles.    But honestly, people go here to impress a business client, or for a special occasion.  It's a great place to go if you are not picking up the tab and you want to feel pampered.  The menu is more diverse than both Ruth Chris and Mortons, when it comes to the food, I think the Capital Grille far outshines the competition.   The Sommelier is well trained and knows a lot about food pairings and making wine recommendations.     So overall, the Capital Grille is expensive, but at the same time high quality, and is always my first choice when recommending a steak house."}
{"text":"All aspects of the restaurant's service were way below my expectation for a restaurant of this caliber, with the exception of the valet.  The hostesses seemed disoriented and confused when I arrived and pointed to the table where the rest of my party had been seated rather than escorting me.   Our waitress would be a better fit at McDonald's than a high end establishment, she referred to me as \"Hun\" several times. She never asked if we wanted another bottle of wine. Her assistants were also inattentive to our needs (we requested water 3 times before our glasses were filled).   The highlight of my experience was my meal."}
{"text":"Definitely a \"Yay! I'm a fan\" kind of restaurant.  The ambiance was classy and romantic plus you get some great views of the strip. Came here on a late Sunday night and my boyfriend and I were completely satisfied with the food and service.  Decided to get some soup and salad before our entrees. My boyfriend got the Wedge with Bleu Cheese and Applewood Smoked Bacon. I got their special of the day...month? Creamy Potato Leek Soup. My waitress described it as an Au Gratin Potatoes in soup form. Anything potatoes I love so this was freakin fantastic!!!! I can't believe I chose that over Lobster Bisque.   I've heard so much about that infamous Lobster Mac n Cheese so I decided to get that as my entree. And yum....it's as good as everyone raved it to be!!!!!! They didn't skim you on the lobster either...4-5 big chunks that just melts in your mouth.  My boyfriend decided to try something different than what he normally goes for. He got the Gorgonzola and Truffle Crusted Filet Mignon with Cabernet Reduction and he really enjoyed it. He even said he would definitely do a repeat of this.  Valet service for Capital Grille is right around the corner from Top Shop and Forever 21. You just take the elevators up and it takes you right there to the restaurant. Very convenient. It's no surprise that we are going to add this to our many of the regular restaurants we will frequent often. Can't wait to be back!!!"}
{"text":"As far as a steakhouse.. eh..had much better..but I do love the bar.. the apps.. this is one of the places that I hang out with my Nascar buddies.. the bartenders are always on top of things..fun and on the ball. A great wine selection.. Food: I always try the filet..and usually Im disappointed.. 3x to be exact.. they cant seem to cook it correctly! I love the spinach salad.. and again, for 'hang time' ambience.. this is the place to start!"}
{"text":"Start with the parking.  Valet right at the door and the young man was pleasant and personable.  Angelo the server was excellent. Food very good. Long term management and it shows.  Kudos!"}
{"text":"My wife and I recently celebrated our wedding anniversary here and we could not have had a better meal.  The server was impeccable and the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"I love The Capital Grille! All of their steak options are great, you really cant go wrong. Whatever you do, you must order the Lobster Mac and cheese for your side!!!!! Its my favorite side dish in the world. Its so rich, creamy, delicious, and has large chunks of delicious lobster meat all throughout. You wont be dissapointed!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Capital Grille Scottsdale and the experience was wonderful. Janet was our server and was so kind and knowledgeable. So often you have a decent and expensive dinner with mediocre service, but not here! My husband had the T-bone and our son had the dry-aged rib-eye.  Both were perfectly cooked and tender. Smiles all around.  You must order the lobster mac and cheese and wedge salad.  Their blue-cheese dressing was so smooth and delicious.  We'll be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Great service by Coco. Went in for the first time today to celebrate my birthday and everything was excellent. Started with clam chowder soup. Hands down the best clam chowder soup I've ever had. Next course was the filet mignon. Perfectly cooked. We saw the lobster mac and cheese on yelp and discovered it wasn't on the lunch menu. The chef made an exception and let us order it. The steaks are reasonably priced and actually come with a side unlike some other steak houses in the valley. At this point we were stuffed and skipped on dessert. They came out with complimentary dessert which was delicious. Only took a few bites and took the rest home. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Mike, our server, was simply amazing! Best service I've ever had! The manager was great too, coming to check on us and making sure everything was to our liking. I will be back again and again, because of the excellent, 5 star service here!!!   The calamari, lobster crab cakes, and the scallops were delicious!   They made my fiancé's 35th birthday really memorable! Thank you Capital Grille!"}
{"text":"Always a nice spot to grab a drink or have dinner. I love this place if you are on a low carb diet and they are accommodating with food allergies. I love their pineapple vodka drink. Great for a date night."}
{"text":"Yes please restaurant week for giving me the reason to put on my fancy shoes and valet my late model ride at Capital grille uptown. We had a large group so we grabbed a drink at the bar while we waited on our party to arrive. We ended up enjoying dinner in their private dining room- hello fabulous service and an exclusive feel. This may have not been the best steak I ever had but some of my friends were kind enough to share and their entrees were stand outs. Salads and soups were just so-so but they do their meat right. Dessert was also amazing. Several months later I still remember the service and experience here. Highly recommend if you are rolling in the dough or looking for a special evening."}
{"text":"Everything was awesome! The food excellent, the service!! Everyone was so nice! And they had a nice touch , it was our anniversary they made us a greeting card and give us some free and deli dessert! Bravo!!!"}
{"text":"we made a reservation for 12 for a bachelorette party... and they sat us in a private room by the wine display, which was very nice. our waiter was very funny, polite and entertaining... best waiter i've ever had probably. :)  the only thing i didnt like... was the food. which would be the major thing. i would not come here again to a large sum on ok food... it was probably what i had tho, i had t a soup and salad since nothing else appealed to me. i dont eat steak and am not fond of big chunks of chicken... or lobster... so i guess i am bias.   the atmosphere was nice, but not something id want to do again."}
{"text":"Excellent environment and waitresses. Made my family feel welcome and not hesistant on the tip. Prices here are extremely reasonable. We ordered the porterhouse and bone in ribeye as main course, somebsalad and crab cakes. Crab cake is excellent, almost 100% crab and lobster. A must get. The porterhouse was NOT cooked perfectly. I ordered medium rare and I could taste everything from rare to well done. Yes. Well done. That said, it was seasoned and charred pretty well. I would recommend this place and I will revisit them if I go to vegas again and give them another chance. I think next time I will try a smaller piece of meat. Btw free parking is a plus, especially in vegas."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Steak cooked perfectly. Overpriced food and wine but always consistent."}
{"text":"This is the best steakhouse in Pittsburgh.  It is not the cheapest!!! However, it is the best service and the best food so you get what you pay for.  The Capital Grille has the best steak, and the best wine list among major steakhouses in the city of Pittsburgh.  Their Kona rubbed steaks are PHENOMENAL .  Their attention to detail on the service side of things is IMPECCABLE.  I highly recommend when attending a show at the Benedum (short walking distance).  If you have doggy bags, they will keep them in their cooler until after the show.  They will also let you leave your car with their valets while you attend the show."}
{"text":"First of all, I am not a chain restaurant guy.  Growing up in Manhattan and eating out almost every weekend.  Wasn't until I moved to pitt that I even considered trying this place but due to the lack of steakhouses I wasn't getting my \"proper\" fix so I had to.  Couldnt be happier that I made that initial decision.  Consistency is just what you get at The Capital Grille.  Superior service and a consistently delicious meal.  Expensive but for the quality of the steak Id say its well worth the trip.  If you want extraordinary service ask for Horacio, he will make your evening memorable and treat you like royalty.  Beautiful decor as well and not only is your server great but the entire staff is extremely attentive."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service by a young gentleman, Ryan. He had great recommendations and impeccable service. One of the best steaks that I've had! I had the bone-in filet with the Oscar (crab meat and sauce). I'm not much into chain restaurants, however, I would definitely come back and try another location."}
{"text":"Celebrating a special occasion. This is a place I would recommend. Valet makes it a breeze to get to considering it's in the heart of Downtown. The ambiance is very classy, romantic and they really pay attention to detail. To celebrate a birthday they put birthday themed confetti on the table. The drink menu and wine list was on an iPad. It was easy to navigate even if you are not tech savvy. I had the Stoli Doli a pineapple martini and it was good. The bread was delicious. I loved the lobster bisque it had a nice big chunk of lobster in it. I had the pan seared scallops with lobster mac which were phenomenal. The service was outstanding. They really impressed me. It was a fine dining experience and I would certainly go back. There are several menu items I want to try."}
{"text":"My wife and i decided to try Capital Grill Scottsdale for her birthday.The whole dining experience was top notch all the way.The steak we decided on was the was the bone in ribeye and it was fantastic,medium rare of  course.The spinach salads were first and we decided to split the lobster Mac and cheese,i was not sure of our choice with steak ,but it worked great with the steak.The service was the best we have had in any restaurant that we have been too.Im 69 years old and have been too many great restaurants but the service at capital grill beat all contenders.All i can say is to check it out for your self.Oh by    the way   our waiter was Joe he  answered all questions about the menue.The ribeye was a 10 by far the best steaks we have ever had.  Thanks Jim and Vicki!"}
{"text":"Did you know that the Capital Grill is doing their Generous Pour for the summer?  Me either!! I found out quickly enough though!   So first let me say - I was lucky enough to be seated in the section of the most amazing waitress I have had the pleasure of dining with in many years! Her name is Sharon - and if you are making a reservation - I would ask for her - because she turned a mediocre night for me into an Outstanding night.  Her personality and passion for what she does shines in every word she uses. I was intrigued and in awe from the first second!!  We ordered the wines - yes ALL of them! We drank well over our fair  share - and loved every second.  Let me describe dessert - Coconut Cream Pie - OH MY!!! Dreamy, decadent and a perfect ending to my feast.  I started with Beef Carpaccio - which was perfect. The simplicity of this dish was amazing.  Then I had the Swordfish - which was prepared perfectly. Most restaurants tend to over do this dish - but Capital Grill nailed it!  After all of my indulging, I was leaving and could not help but tell everyone, including Sharon what a treat she was.   The funny part is - she actually took the time to send me a thank you card in the mail. When was the last time anyone took that kind of time, in today's world?   I can't wait to go back and see Sharon again and of course have yummy food!!!"}
{"text":"I had never been to CG and decided to indulge myself a little while out of town on business. After a brief conversation with a foodie friend, I was directed to CG over Ruths Chris for a good steak experience.   Food: 1 Star   For fancy steakhouses, I only have Flemings and Mortons to compare to. I also have the wise words of my father who always told me that only poorly cooked steaks need steak sauce.   I've been to Flemings several times and every time it's always come seasoned perfectly. At Capital Grille in Charlotte, to my surprise and disappointment, I got a $60 bill and an unseasoned, tasteless steak to show for it. I did order some bleu cheese crumbles to go with it but it didn't mix well either. I ended up using the bleu for my mashed potatoes which made those a total hit!   But to goto a fancy shmancy steakhouse where you (or your company) is charged an arm and a leg and they can't even properly cook your steak for you is just criminal. I am assuming my problem was remote and hopefully only a local problem but it left a bad taste in my mouth for the next time I goto a nice steakhouse.   Service: 4 Star   Service was great, but obviously, who cares if you get crap at your plate?"}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I went here as part of restaurant week to try it out for the first time with the expectation that it would be very busy. Surprisingly the wait (with a reservation of course) was not too long and we were seated fairly quickly. The only downside to the night was being seated in a tiny back room with pretty terrible lighting and our waiter (Alex) was a little overbearing and uncomfortable.  However, the food completely made up for the atmosphere. I had an 8oz filet medium and it was AMAZING!! So juicy and perfectly cooked! I could not have imagined a better steak. Boyfriend had a 14oz New York Strip which he says is the best NY Strip he has ever had. We are both steak lovers but have become fairly picky about our steaks and these left us completely satisfied.  The wine selection was wonderful, unfortunately the red we chose was not my favorite. However that was completely our choice, not a recommendation so we take responsibility for that one. We would consider this a success and definitely a top choice for the next special occasion."}
{"text":"Very high quality food, service and atmosphere. On par with Ruth Chris and Mortons except bright and airy interior. Highest grade of beef in the ribeye sandwich, tenderloin cobb salad, and burger with truffle fries. Perfectly crisp Caesar salad. Really enjoyed our lunch."}
{"text":"Our recent party of five dined at Capital Grille in celebration of a business accomplishment. We found the food excellent and the service impeccable. The management went out of their way to accommodate us with a quiet round table that was fitting for the occasion. The dining ambience was subdued, elegant, and not over the top. Thanks to Sergio for a memorable evening."}
{"text":"Marvin was a pleasure to have as a waiter, so sincere and sweet! The food matched the service perfectly and was amazing, and the wine was just as excellence! 5 stars across the board! Even the hostess, Tashira was so fabulous and made us and our guest feel so welcomed!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place lacks for nothing. Superb food and top notch service. What more can you ask for?  I had lunch here recently and was simply amazed at the attention to detail. The staff was the epitome of \"professional,\" friendly and attentive. The decor is upscale, yet inviting. Most importantly, the food  was outstanding in every way. It was one of those times where you take a few extra bites past \"full\" because the flavor is THAT good.  Highlights: check out the Calamari appetizer, the Tenderloin Sliders, the Truffle Fries, and the Stoli Doli.  If there's one drawback to Capital Grille, it's the prices. This place is expensive. Still, if you go in knowing this in advance, you won't have anything else to gripe about. Capital Grille will take good care of you. I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"This is a very good steak house.  Very swanky place as well.  My husband really enjoys their filet mignon."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go to the Capital Grille in SoCal, but never got to doing this.  However, when I saw that there was one in Las Vegas while searching for a place to fine dine in Vegas, I immediately booked a reservation to celebrate my recent promotion.  Once we arrrived, we were seated immediately.  Our table was decorated with foil confetti in the shape of balloons and there was a card sealed with wax to congratulate me on my promotion.  I am impressed by this because I was expecting a table with a view that I requested since we were having a late dinner, but not the decorated table because I thought it was usually birthdays and anniversaries that  are given this.  We definitely had a nice view of the Las Vegas Strip.  Our waiter, Eric, was amazing!  He was very attentive to us even though he had to tend to a number of tables.  He took the time to explain how we can go through the wine list via a tablet.  He also suggested food items that we might enjoy and so we ordered some of these items and wow....delicious I must say!  Everything we ordered was very tasty...fresh oysters on a half shell, lobster bisque, kona rib eye, chilean sea bass, lobster mac and cheese, and brussel spouts!  Of course we couldn't eat everything so we brought it back to our hotel and stored it in the fridge for late night snacking.  Each item we brought back was boxed and labeled with the name of the food item and the bag had an attached label signed by the chef.  Wow!  Never seen that before and we've been fine dining forever.  Last but not least...we ordered the coconut dessert the I saw people raving about and it was exactly what I expected! Yummy!  To make it even better, Eric said it was on the house due to my promotion!  The \"wow\" factor kept going through the night, but the only negative thing was that after we were served our wine, it took at least 45 min to receive our appetizers.  However, I didn't take away any stars for this since everything else was amazing!"}
{"text":"My husband surprised me with dinner here for our 20th wedding anniversary. It was a perfect evening. We were warmly greeted and seated upon arrival. We had a table with red hearts and a nice anniversary card from Capital Grille. Our server, Ryan David, was exceptional. I know he had other tables but we felt like he was there just for us. The food was delicious. The shrimp cocktail was great and you must try the calamari. Yum! The steaks were juicy and flavorful. The lobster mac and cheese was decadent. I could eat it every day and still want more. We had a wine tasting special at our table. It was fun to see if we could guess what kind each was. The whites were easier than the reds. We had a complimentary dessert duo; cheesecake and something rich & chocolate. The cheesecake was my favorite. I love food and am not easily impressed but I was impressed with my meal. From beginning to end we thoroughly enjoyed every moment. Don Goodwin, the manager, came by our table to see if we were pleased with everything. We were. It was our first visit but it will not be our last. Please dine here at least once. You will be glad you did."}
{"text":"This is a rather fancy joint that has mistakenly let a poor, grungy, unrefined artsy type (me) in as a customer... twice. And they weren't even snooty towards me, but it may have been because of the massive quantities of wine my relatives were consuming. Both times I had the coffee-rubbed steak. it was excellent....great unique (at least, to me!) combination of flavors.   My parents threw my graduation party here, and we were seated in a private room closed off from the rest of the restaurant. It was really nice, quiet, and the wait staff was perfectly attentive... not too intrusive, but lurking politely nearby to refill drinks.  That's about all i can say for the place, really."}
{"text":"I try to take my grandma to dinner once a week so she can get out and about so this week decided to try this place   The walk was a good distance for my grandma they have valet and then you take an elevator to the 3rd floor.....   We were seated right away with no wait which was great    Our server was Michael awesome server very friendly  (talked a little fast sometimes I missed a few things he said but not a big deal )   We started with the coldfish platter was super yummy came with crab lobster oysters crab claws and shrimp a perfect mixture and enough so everyone can have some of each which is great    My grandma got the ribeye which was a big portion I was surprised at the size but that's great to pay for a steak and get a great size no one will complain about that!!! She LOVED her steak cook just how she liked it !! Wasn't dry I could see it had juices! I ordered the sea ball YUMMY (I eat a lot of steak when I go to steak houses) so I wanted to try something else.... But I must say I was very happy the sauce was perfect made the fish nice and juicy we got side orders of mash potatoes I LOVED Them I couldn't stop eating them... And a side of mushrooms we saved room for desert so we got some doggy bags   We got the warm chocolate cake it was good not my favorite of the night but it was yummy!!!   I would come back (my bill was around 300$) but it was worth it plus anything to see my grandma smile"}
{"text":"Always a great dining experience.  The filet doesn't get too much better.  Sides are tasty.  Salads and soups good.  It's a power diner place... red tie and jacket the norm, though not required.  Lively service staff, less romantic steakhouse than business place.  Not cheap, but you leave full of great beef.  One of my top 3 steakhouses in Phoenix.    And by the way, it's the best value on the entire Restaurant Week list.  I make it there every time, even while changing up the other restaurants.  And it's one of the ones I come back to to even when no special, because the food is very good.  This is probably the place I'd take an extra special client to if he flew into town.  Wish they had a daily happy hour."}
{"text":"Went in on a Saturday night, using a $50 gift certificate.  Ate at the bar, they actually offer a full menu at the bar which is great.  However, the bar tender's service is probably one of r worst I have experienced at an upscale restaurant.  When she realized that I had a gift certificate she started huffing and puffing.  Short hair middle age blonde lady. (I still tipped 25% of the entire bill with out he discount). Terrible terrible service, quite embarrassing for this type of establishment.  Other than that the food was great. :)"}
{"text":"Last night I dined at Capital Grille with my date to celebrate my birthday. This restaurant had really great reviews. I ordered the filet mignon with the Au Gratin potatoes and my date ordered the scallop dish. My steak was very tender and the sauce made it more flavorful but it was still bland for my liking. I didn't like the au gratin potatoes and my date didn't enjoy his scallops. The manager came by to check up on us and my date expressed his distaste for the scallop dish and was brought out a different scallop dish with 15 year old balsamic and it was delightful. I don't know if I would return to this restaurant. I wasn't blown away by the meal."}
{"text":"Worthy of five stars. I had the halibut; incredibly flavorful and cooked to perfection. Filet mignon to your expectations, I assure you.  fresh pecan Brussel sprout shaved smoked bacon goat cheese salad. However if you leave without the crème brûlée cheesecake then you might as well not gotten up in the morning -you missed the boat.  I will drive an hour for this cheesecake."}
{"text":"This was my first time there.  It was my 20th wedding anniversary. They had rose petals on my table. They gave us free champagne and (((my favorite dessert))) creme brulee!! mmmm. We forgot our camera, so our waitress KRISTEN  (The best waitress EVER)!! took a photo of us, and then printed it for us to take home. How is that for price-less SERVICE!! Thank you Kristen for making a moment in time, not just a memory. I will return there because of the wonderful service and to die for food. Signed Al & Angela Ghilarducci LV NV..   We give you 6 stars...."}
{"text":"Excellent night!!!! You get what you pay for. Superb food excellent service Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This review is only for holding an event here, not an individual dining experience.  Prefixe menu had good choices and food was good, not amazing but really good for a big group of about 25-30. The group was very high maintenance and the staff and servers did a stellar job serving and taking care of special needs. Service was too long, but not sure if that was intentional and they did nail the meals so I won't deduct points. They did a overall great job managing the event, would go back."}
{"text":"Was here last month, but only hung out at the bar. A nice bar with great service from the bartenders. The shrimp cocktail and calamari are good choices. I can't say enough good things about their signature drink...the Stoli Doli. It's pineapple infused vodka. Can be a bit dangerous after a while, since it tastes like a lighter, more refreshing pineapple juice. Bethany was awesome! She is friendly and knows how to have a good conversation. I'm sure I will be stopping my again."}
{"text":"Great as always!   This was our third visit in LV to the grille and it was awesome. We have visited other locations and this is one place I can always go and know it will be a great dinner."}
{"text":"Awesome, waited on me hand and foot, was a joy till the bill came but fuck it luxuries come at a price!!!"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic lunch today and it was my first time to Gapital Grill.  Our waiter was Nelson and he was excellent, very kind and professional.  I had the citrus salmon and my boyfriend had the filet.  We had calimari to start and the chocolate cake to finish.  All was cooked to perfection and seasoned just right.  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Food was decent but not extraordinary like I had expected for these prices.  We had salmon and the steak (which was very undercooked for a medium but we didn't complain).  Server was trying too hard to be our best friend and involve himself in our conversation, etc., although other helpers in the process were excellent and can't be faulted.  Place was only 50% full, There are so many other better choices I'm afraid we won't be back."}
{"text":"If I would have to choose three restaurants as the only places I can eat until I die, this would be one of them. How does  \"Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin with Caramelized Shallot Butter\" sound? Freakin AMAZING...(5+++*) The salad I had \"The Wedge\" was real fresh iceberg lettuce with tasty dressing and real big bacon pieces (4*).  The crab and lobster cake had huge pieces of crab leg and lobster in it which was definitely the best crab cake I ever had (5+++*).  Their signature Martini was delicious. Apparently they keep it inside a pineapple for about 14 days (5+*).  I wasn't a big fan of the mocca chocolate cake (2*) which was very rich and was probably just my wrong choice of dessert.   Go here for the best Dry aged steak, the best crab cake and amazing pineapple martinis."}
{"text":"This place rocks!! The lobster mac and cheese, Truffle fries, Calamari, Lobster Bisque.... Everything I tried was soooo good!! Their signature drink, Vodka infused pinapples...Mmmmm.... That was the best...if you want to have a really nice dinner on the Vegas strip this is a great place to go..."}
{"text":"...It is expensive... Ya! ...It is Classy and a lovely place to enjoy incredible food... Ya! ...it has a delightful and impressive menu... Ya!  Do they have the best staff to meet, seat and greet? You betta believe it...Nathan behind the bar, Adam tag teams behind the bar and on the floor and Blake is on the floor.  No one could ask for better service with a warm smile!  I love these guys and have followed them from one 5-Star foodie hang to the next...you will too!  I have enjoyed the steaks prepared perfectly, the Salmon exquisitely grilled and the lamb lollipops that make you want to order another. The sides all speak volumes of flavor and the desserts add more calories than you should count.  Nevertheless, these is one of my Favs!"}
{"text":"Sundays in uptown Charlotte during non-football season are just slightly more lively than a ghost town. As such, most of the better restaurants are closed, which is not exactly the most auspicious start to an evening out (in this particular case, Alton Brown's \"Eat Your Science\" tour stop at the Blumenthal). We settled on Capital Grille after finding our first few choices were not open, as I figured that they wouldn't be very busy and the meal should be pretty good.  Well, I was half right. They weren't very busy.  The specials tonight were a South African lobster tail ($45) and a bone-in filet mignon ($64). We ordered one of each, plus a mozzarella and tomato salad and a cup of lobster bisque for appetizers and sides of their lobster mac and cheese and asparagus. Also ordered a pineapple-infused vodka martini for the lady and a bottle of the La Giaretta ripasso-style valpolicella (a decent value at $55).  The martini was decent, the wine was very good. Then the food started arriving. The tomatoes in the mozzarella salad tasted like nothing, certainly not like the vine-ripened tomatoes described on the menu. A little sprinkle of salt, and they tasted like...well, salt. The fresh mozzarella was rubbery and crumbling, which is a time/temperature control issue. The lobster bisque was very tasty, but marred by at least two pieces of shell, one of which I felt in my throat when I swallowed it.  Main courses weren't an improvement. The lobster tail was okay, but nothing like the delicate flavor of cold water lobster. To their credit, the lobster was cooked properly, but definitely not worthy of the price tag. The filet...wow, what a disappointment. Ordered medium rare, and part of the steak WAS medium rare, but not most of it. The steak was fairly charred, and the first couple of centimeters on the side away from the bone were very well done. The next part was a beautiful medium-rare, which became progressively more rare as the meat approached the bone. I like rare beef so this wasn't a huge issue for me other than the fact that it wasn't how it was ordered. The bigger issue was the lack of flavor. \"Brushed with steak butter\" was how the dish was described, but there wasn't even a hint of butter flavor. The price of a filet is due to its incredible texture but the cut isn't the most flavorful, which is why filets are usually paired with a sauce. This steak really needed something more.  Sides: The lobster mac was very good, but a pretty meager portion for its $18 price tag. The asparagus ($11) was overcooked to the point that it was mushy. Because we were short on time due to our event at the Blumenthal, this was the only item I sent back. The replacement sent out by the kitchen was much better.  Once our waiter was told (he never inquired) that the meal was part of a birthday celebration (mine), he picked up our dessert menus and brought out a complimentary creme brulee along with two glasses of champagne. I'll admit, the creme brulee was as good as I've had in quite a while (excluding those made by yours truly). Excellent crust with the custard underneath still cool and creamy...no sweet scrambled eggs like seems to be the norm at John Dressler's restaurants.  The service was okay. Our waiter's wine presentation was a little off, and he managed to spill a bit while pouring. The worst part was his incredible overuse of the word \"perfect\" at every table interaction, especially when so much of the meal was anything but.  The name may be Capital Grille, but my experience was decidedly lowercase. Two stars for an incredibly forgettable yet pricey dining experience. I debated giving a single star, but I'll reserve that for my review of Alton Brown's performance."}
{"text":"We were so fortune to celebrate here with friends for a birthday...we received stellar service and fantastic food. Our server was very attentive and she made certain we were satisfied without interrupting our flow of conversation... in fact, everyone we encountered made our dinner special. The ambiance, the side-dishes (all were excellent), the main course and dessert/presentation made for a perfect evening.    Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is definitely as good as it gets. The service is impeccable. The atmosphere is wonderful. My favorite thing to order is the Porcini Delmonico (dry aged rib eye). You also gotta try the crab cakes, it comes with this fresh sweet corn salsa. mmm. A good place to celebrate or take a hot date to. Holla!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with our service in the bar. I celebrated my 50th with friends last year at this same restaurant but in the dining room and had an amazing experience! Great food and great service!  Last night at the bar I was with one of my best girlfriend of 27 years. We both were sitting at the bar. The bartenders never asked if we wanted a drink except when I first got there and wanted water while waiting for my friend. Once she arrived we had to flag down the bartender and he strangely enough only took her drink order and not mine. It was the same experience when I had to get the bartender in order to place my food order. He never asked me after even 30 minutes what I wanted to order. He proceeded to take my order and then not ask my girlfriend what she would like. It was very odd?! Each time our glass was empty they never bothered to ask if we wanted another one. This is a fancy place yet they didn't bother with giving us a cocktail napkin either. They were too busy taking care of groups with all men. We truly felt we were being ignored because we were women. The manager did take care of our bill. He wanted to make it right. Then he stuck his foot in his mouth with a non business like apology. Instead of acknowledging our feelings and saying I hope you give us another chance he chose to say his staff is excellent and didn't intend to ignore us. I was so polite saying his staff was very nice just not attentive at all to us but very attentive to all the men that sat after myself.  I love their food but after the way we were treated will not be going back. Frankly the manager was more concerned with checking bar tickets then taking the time to address our concerns. We had to wait quite some time for him to come over. I get better response from every other manager I've ever dealt with. Including to compliment them on their staff."}
{"text":"Met some friends here while on a recent trip to Las Vegas.  The service was great as was the food.  We had a table overlooking the strip so that was nice.  The steak and fish dishes all got good reviews from our table.  Dessert was amazing.  This is definitely a place we're coming back to our next time in town."}
{"text":"I'm sorry Capital Grille I really wanted to give you four stars but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. Your dining room is very nice and your staff so very polite and accommodating as saints.  I'll echo what Adam R. said and say that steakhouses are not usually my dining preference when choosing a place to eat at but I had really enjoyed the good eats at the Capital Grille Generous Pour event recently I decided to give it a shot. Warmly greeted at the door and reservations confirmed even though we had arrived a bit earlier than expected, their hospitality is as good as ever. The problem is I didn't exactly enjoy my meal as much as I would have hoped even though I still had a good time surrounded by friends and family.  Appetizers came out in a very timely manner once menu choices were made. I chose clam chowder based on a recommendation. Well it wasn't amazing but it wasn't bad either, a well made clam chowder is one of my favorite things to eat so this was a bit of a let down. My entree a Kona crusted dry aged sirloin was perfectly cooked and served with a nice composite shallot butter how old school! The only problem is that they didn't cook all the steaks as well as mine. One person had ordered a medium steak and it came out well done and extremely charred (It was comped when she mentioned it and the waiter and manager were very sorry and concerned about this so I'll have to thumbs up them for handling a situation so graciously). The shallot butter though didn't really add anything to the dish for me and the steak wasn't so flavorful that it could stand on it's own. The best part of the meal? Dessert! But not my dessert, I was talked up on the ice cream and decided to order it instead of creme brulee. Well that was a major mistake on my part. My whole meal had been heavy and if I had went with sorbet I might have been able to finish it, but I decided on ice cream. Peanut butter, chocolate, and vanilla ice cream was just too much to handle for me and I called it quits after a spoonful of each. The creme brulee was still as addictive as ever from what I tried on someone's plate though!  I would go back here just for the service alone. It's really nice to be treated like they really care about your visit. It might be a while before I head back though but cheers Capital Grille!"}
{"text":"If you really want to test a restaurant, go eat there as a single. A lot of high end restaurants, like Joe's seafood prime steak crab in Vegas, don't like single tables and they treat you like crap. Not at The Capital Grille!  They treated me like I was a VIP. Excellent service from Mike Sabini who gave me his card to request him next time. Who knew you could do that?  Anyway, got a nice table with a view of the strip. The lobster bisque was very nice, good ceaser salad and the filet Oscar style was fantastic.  Although you can find a really good steak elsewhere, The Capital Grille should be in your short list!"}
{"text":"Really good steak. Friendly wait staff. Everything is al a cart, so a little expensive. Would definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Wife had the wine/w the wagyu burger and truffle fries. What a great deal! Matt sure steered us the right way!  I had the lamb lollipops yummers...and the lobster mac and cheese another outstanding dish!!! Thanks to the staff at Capital Griile a true dining experience!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, delicious food and great atmosphere. It's pricy, but worth every penny.   The food was delicious. I had bites of the lobster mac and cheese, oysters, lobster with butter sauce and brussel sprouts. My filet was cooked medium rare to perfection and we ended with multiple desserts. The cheesecake was to die for!  We were in a group, but everyone could be heard and no one had to yell. Sometimes it's hard to be in a group for dinner, but it was effortless at this restaurant. Multiple servers helped us and I would go back over and over again.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I visited Capital Grille a couple months ago for the first time with family to celebrate my birthday, and I could not have asked for a better dining experience. Our server Eric provided phenomenal service, and was the perfect mix of helpful, knowledgeable, friendly and professional.  We also sat at a window table with a great view of the strip, which was a nice addition to Our experience. As for the food... It was, hands down, the best meal of my entire life!  We started off with an appetizer of Pan Fried Calamari and a round of delicious Stoli Dolis. From there we enjoyed the shareable Lobster Mac N Cheese and grilled asparagus.  All of these items were delicious, but the main course of Porcini Rubbed Delmonico Steak blew them all away! It was hot, juicy, delicious, and truly an exceptional dish.  I can not wait to celebrate my next special occasion at what, in one night, became my favorite restaurant in the world!"}
{"text":"Impressed with the service, food and atmosphere! Between the amazing food and great employees I have nothing but great things to say about this place!  My husband loves the lobster mac and cheese.. and he is not a picky eater.. so I was expecting it to be so so but man let me tell you... its AMAZING. A must have for mac and cheese lovers!  We sat at the bar tonight and both the bartenders were awesome! Very attentive and friendly. I like when servers actually get to know their customers.. I work in the industry so I pay attention to detail and that's huge to me!   I will definitely be back to this location mainly for the awesome service I I recieved at the bar tonight!"}
{"text":"This is a great steakhouse.  The feel is very east coast versus the Scottsdale flash that Mastros have.  I come here when I want to hear my date and have a good conversation with the people at the table.  I know it's a chain, but everyone that works there is on point, and the steaks are great as well.  Whether your sitting in the bar for a quick bite, or having a longer evening in the dining room, its all well worth the price of the meal.  Also, they're rarely busy, so I can usually get a table by calling for a reservation about 1 to 2 hours in advance which is nice."}
{"text":"We are fairly new to town and I was looking for a nice place for our anniversary. I made a reservation which I recommend even middle of the week. The service was too notch as it should be. The food was fantastically presented and tasted amazing. Aged steaks make the best steaks! The lobster Mac n cheese was to die for and the lobster was cooked to perfection. They have an extensive wine list as well. When I made my reservation I told them it was for an anniversary and we were surprised with some sweet treats at the end of our meal as well as some champagne.  Dress is business casual but jeans are acceptable."}
{"text":"I made a last minute reservation at the Capital Grille in Las Vegas for my then-girlfriend's birthday. During the reservation process, they asked if it was for a special occasion and I let them know it was.  We were not readily greeted upon arrival, but once we were, the service from then on out was amazing. The table was prepared with confetti and a handwritten birthday greeting from the staff. Very nice touch. The view was quite nice as well.  They also had a small wine tasting prepared for the two of us, and at the end of our meal, they also brought her a special desert tray. The food was wonderful, I ordered the filet mignon which was cooked to perfection. The sides and salad were also very good.  It was on the pricey side, but it's a high class restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip, so... to be expected.  I really have nothing to complain about. It was a stellar experience and I will return if the urge strikes again, and I am sure that it will."}
{"text":"Went lastnight and had the filet and lobster tail. The view, service and food was amazing! We will be back on our next trip to Vegas"}
{"text":"Had lunch there 12/27. I had french onion soup and filet mignon, my husband had clamchowder & dry aged ny strip with some wine. They were all good, not fantastic. We both ordered our steaks medium rare and two steaks were VERY different. Mine was almost rare and my husband's had no red center at all (too cooked). The service wasn't bad, but not excellent. Maybe because lunch fares are more casual? Noticed that they do offer cheaper lunch Plate menus($20 for appetizer+entree), so I might try that with some girlfriends next time. But for $150+tip for lunch, I wasn't too thrilled about my experience today."}
{"text":"Another fiver. I'm either too damn generous or I just don't go to enough dumps. Either way, suits me.  We started off with oysters on the half shell. I don't know what compels people to eat snot, horseradish and oil on a half shell, but, they do. I just simply don't get it.  Nothing like going to a steakhouse to get fish. I selected a delicious filet of halibut atop a sick good (albeit small) portion of spaetzel. I was with a rather large group, who almost universally, ordered filets. (They) had a few bottles of a recommended red wine with their steaks, and we all shared lobster mac & cheese, some green stuff, and braised mushrooms. I finished it off with a girly single espresso (with lemon peel) and the coconut cream pie. Awesome.   What a great environment, excellent service and ridiculous food. For a chain restaurant, I have to say, this one's creme de le creme... It was amazing food, good atmosphere, and surprisingly inexpensive. The bar tab was easily 1/2 of the bill, and with a party of 6, was still just a little more than $100 a person.  When in Scottsdale, turn left at the golf course (that's a joke... there's 12 trillion golf courses here) and find this place. It's good."}
{"text":"First off,  I went here during restaurant week.  Restaurant week is the greatest thing in the world because you get to eat at places like this for $30 a plate instead of the standard $50-$60.  That being said... this place is fantastic.  The meat is cooked perfectly, the french onion soup was great, and the creme brulee was the best I've ever had.  I've noted a few people say their meat was cooked improperly... I've never been one to send back food but at a steakhouse of this caliber, do so at anytime.  That being said.. please no wtf a medium rare steak looks like and what a medium well steak looks like.    Will be back.... during the summer when they have essentially the same deal if you dine after 8pm... otherwise the bills around here tend to look like car payments."}
{"text":"The service is top notch. The food ranges from good to awesome. The portions are filling and the presentation is pleasing.   Their claim to fame is a great steak.  I am not steak person but based on the comments of the folks I have dined with the steaks are flavorful. I've  had the sea bass and the ahi tuna.  Both were cooked to perfection  The creamed corn and lobster Mac and cheese are sinfully delightful.   The cheesecake is one of the best I've ever had.   The views are amazing and the seats are comfy.   It's not a place I'd go to every night but for a special occasion or to escape mundane dining this place is perfect."}
{"text":"Where to start with this review?  I will first start with the wonderful greeting at the door by the hostesses.  I am temporarily in a wheel chair and they just couldn't be quick enough to make sure we were able to get into the door without it being awkward for me.  We had a reservation so we were immediately seated, in a very comfortable spot where my chair wouldn't inconvenience other diners.  That is very important to me, because when I go out to dine, the last thing I want is for my experience to be ruined because of other diners not being considerate.   Next, we were greeted by our server Ken, who by the way happens to be about one of the best servers I think I have ever encountered in this type of establishment.  That isn't to say that our local haunts that we frequent often are not just as good because they are, but this is about this particular experience.  Ken was extremely knowledgeable about their very extensive wine list and very knowledgeable about the specials and how things in the kitchen were prepared.  The first thing we ordered were the lobster and crab cakes. We asked if they were more meat than breading and he informed us that they were very meaty and he wasn't exaggerating.  I have a very hard time eating much especially if bread is involved.   These were amazing.  I ordered the double bone lamb chops med rare and they came out perfectly, perfectly seasoned and were very good.  My husband ordered the steak delmonico (spelling) and he ordered it med rare also (there is no point in eating it any other way)  Well Ken actually suggested that my husband order this steak medium because of the way the marbling cooked, and so it was ordered medium and he was not steered wrong.  With that we shared the lobster mac & cheese, and wow, just wow.  I am not a lobster lover by any stretch because I've always found it to taste like dirt and be very tough.  I guess the difference here is claw meat rather than a tail. Whatever the difference was, we absolutely loved it.  The only issue of the whole night was SO MUCH FOOD. That isn't a bad thing, we have a teen at home, and how many teens get rack of lamb as a doggy bag?  We did take home some desserts to share with the young one.    Now to praise the management team.  It isn't all that unusual for managers to come to your table and ask how your meal is, but I have to say that Torri and Bow went out of their way to make sure we were having a wonderful experience, and we noticed that it seemed to be just the way of doing business at the Capital Grille.  It is so nice to be just an average joe and feel like you are a VIP on a night out.  So a personal thank you to both of them for making us feel so special.   In short, you can't go wrong here.  Excellent service, excellent food that is quite frankly just as simple as it gets, and beautifully done.  A peeve of mine is having a bunch of useless stuff on my plate that just gets thrown away.  Plating can be beautiful without all that, and the Capital Grille has that down."}
{"text":"I have gone here around 4-5 times with my family because the first time we went, everything was FANTASTIC! I got the chicken dish (which at the time was different than the one they have on their menu now) and some other members of my family got the filet mignon and we all shared the Au Gratin potatoes and mashed potatoes. Our first experience was fabulous. The steaks were done perfectly and my chicken was moist, delicious, and flavorful.   Unfortunately the experience has declined with each subsequent visit...  The very last time we went (early February of this year) was terrible. I had the chicken dish as well as the steaks that my family had and they were all horribly, horribly dry and bland. The chicken was the driest I've ever had in my LIFE- certainly not worth almost $30 I paid for it. And the steaks were overcooked as well! It was the biggest waste of money- I barely ate 1/3 of my meal, if even that. No one could finish their steaks either.  I'm giving The Capital Grille 2 stars because the first time we went was wonderful and all of the food was delicious. In addition, the service has always been pretty good and the atmosphere is nice. However, the experience's we've had since then have not been fitting for a restaurant of this caliber (and not to mention price). The Au Gratin potatoes have been consistently tasty, but how can you really mess up cheesy potatoes? We've been adamant on giving The Capital Grille a few more chances after the great first impression, but unfortunately we've learned that it is just too expensive of a risk after so many disappointments."}
{"text":"I have now been here for dinner twice  and can fully commit to the 5 star rating!  In December a friend brought my sister and I here for our Xmas present.  LeeAnn D's review summs up that experience perfectly except she left out the bread basket.  I swear I could have been happy just sitting there eating bread all night, it was such a great selection!  The last time I was here was for restaurant week.  As a thank you for the meal in Dec, the manager gave my friend a $50 gift card for a return visit that had to be used by beginning of Feb, so we decided to eat here again.  Mixed green salad was good, dressing on the side though otherwise it drowns the lettuce.  Porcini rubbed tournedos of beef were excellent, and I actually couldn't finish both.  The mashed potatos were probably the best I have ever had anywhere.  You just knew there was 3 sticks of butter and a ton of heavy cream in there, but they were simply amazing.  The creamed spinach however, tasted like soap, bleh.  Our server replaced them when we told her they tasted funny, but the 2nd batch just had a milder soapy flavor.  Still this was not enough to ruin an otherwise perfect meal.  Creme brulee to finish up and the chocolate espresso cake to go since my friend doesn't care for dessert, was a great ending to the meal.  With the gift card and the restaurant week pricing it made this meal with 4 glasses of wine and 2 cocktail about $43 pre tip.  Tip on the pre discounted amount and we still walked away paying $60 for a meal that could have been A LOT more expensive.  I almost felt like we were stealing since I know how pricey this place can be!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. I hardly ever give out five stars to a restaurant, but Capital Grille deserves it. Located where all the restaurants are outside Fashion Show Mall and on the second floor is Capital Grille. Upon walking in you are greeted with a very warm welcome from the staff and we were quickly seated. No matter where you get seated in the restaurant there is a nice view of the strip. First and foremost, our server Robert was very attentive and took great care of us. I asked if I could see the alcohol menu and he gave me this neat little tablet to show all the alcohol they had. Unfortunately I couldn't find my favorite alcoholic beverage on there, which is the Midori sour, so I asked Robert what was the closest thing they had to Midori sour. Luckily Robert told me not to worry as he stated they have basically every alcohol in stock.   Now for the food:  We ordered  -Calamari: Extremely yummy and full of flavors, an excellent appetizer.  -Bone in Kona: Prepared perfectly and packed with full of flavor.  -Bone in ribeye steak: Prepared perfectly, couldn't get any better.  -Scallops: Pure yumminess and you can taste the freshness.  -Seared tenderloin with two lobster tails: On the chef specials, HIGHLY recommend.  -Filet Mignon: Prepared perfectly just like all the other steaks, no sauce needed!  -Lobster Mac 'N' Cheese: Just get it. I could eat a bucket of it.  -Roasted Mushrooms: Love mushrooms and putting some on top of your steak just makes it even better.  -Creamed Spinach: TONS of flavor and when paired with your steak and roasted mushrooms, you experience taste to a whole new level.  Overall, Capital Grille is a very well managed restaurant as we had reservations at 7:45 and the place was PACKED yet everything ran smoothly and Robert kept checking on us to make sure if everything came out right.  Pros:  +Staff is very attentive +Steak is prepared just how you requested it +Beautiful view of the strip +Haven't tried the whole menu but everything sounds good +Very nice date spot +Staff is very professional  Cons:  -Place is a bit pricey (but well worth the price) -Place can be a bit hard to find if you're not familiar on where to park as it is on the Strip."}
{"text":"The food is good and the service is better. But the best way to enjoy this place is if someone else is paying!:)) I have to admit the reviews I was reading let me know I was not going to be disappointed and everything everyone said good about the place was correct. The drinks are done well and the steaks are very well done. The lobster bisque is less soup and more gravy, but it was good!!  A good place for a classy dinner, but save it for when someone tells you they want to take you out to dinner."}
{"text":"We had a 60+ person luncheon event here and I'd say the service and food were marginal. For example, I made the mistake of ordering my salad with dressing on the side. This caused 59 people to be served and one to sit and wait at least 15 minutes for lettuce and tomato assembly. These guys may be fine for dinner, but I'd never do another group event. They were a pain in the butt to deal with."}
{"text":"We had an incredible dinner and incredible service. From the moment we sat down until the moment we left everything went great and tasted great. The lobster crab cakes are delicious!!! The salad is large enough for two to share and those two things alone were filling. We did share the steak and lobster meal and glad we did. It was yummy and there was just enough for the two of us without having to cart leftovers home. We did get a complimentary dessert which was exceptional. The flour less chocolate cake was the best chocolate cake I have had anywhere. Would most certainly dine at this location again and again!!"}
{"text":"I really liked the ambiance of this place.  It was dark and felt cozy, yet upscale.  I ordered the Kona crusted Delmonico on the recommendation of one of my dinner mates, and had it cooked medium.  It was a phenomenal steak.  Cooked perfectly and seasoned just right.  I'm skipping ahead though, first I had a Brussels sprout salad.  I expected it to be some kind of warm cooked salad, but the Brussels sprouts were raw.  It was actually really good, and a bit unexpected.  With the entree we ordered sides to share including Brussels sprouts, potatoes au gratin, and asparagus.  I thought the cooked Brussels sprout side needed a bit more seasoning and was slightly under cooked.  The real star was the au gratin potatoes which were delicious.  The dessert!  Truth be told, I almost never get dessert.  However, I can often be swayed with the slightest suggestion if there is either creme brulee or coconut creme pie.  Capital Grille had the coconut pie.  It was awesome.  It's quite large, you would be safe splitting it.  The wait staff was very attentive.  Overall a great experience.  I will definitely return if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We had our office holiday party here last night.  It was an amazing experience! We had a great view of the Strip and the food was spectacular. I had the bone-in aged ribeye with a balsamic reduction, medium rare. Best steak I've had in a long time. Service was superb. It was quiet and elegant, the way a top tier restaurant should be. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Capital Grille in Chicago is hands down one of my favorites. Expected this to be somewhat similar, very disappointed. The ambience is okay but not what you'd expect. Service was subpar. Had to ask for the specials, ask for a drink menu, ask for a dessert menu. A lot of reaching over/past the customer. The plating of dishes seemed average. Unless you have some special connections to people who work here, I recommend Red."}
{"text":"First time at a Capital Grille. It was a friends birthday and the staff made it special. We went there for the steak and I can attest that this was the finest 10 oz filet ever! It was cooked to perfection and had great texture and flavor. Divine. For the $45 I expected nothing short of great and it was. We started off the meal with salads-a kale with peanut dressing and the field green salad. Both arrived dressed despite our request that dressing be on the side. We shared a side of asparagus which was nice but nothing exceptional. The complimentary birthday tasting was an added touch that was very appreciated. In a word-Go for the steak. That's what this place is all about and they know how to execute it beautifully."}
{"text":"Hands down best steak I've had in a long time. We came here to celebrate Melissa W's birthday. The food and service excelled on all levels.   I began with the lobster bisque. This creamy and delicious starter set the tone for the rest of the meal. Tender pieces of lobster whisked together in a warm roux, with a hint of cognac. Devoured in minutes.   My main course was the bone-in 16oz filet, cooked medium. Though not the healthiest of cuts, I've started to prefer steak selections with the bone because they're often more flavorful. This one was no exception. The doneness was excellent and the flavors were practically perfect. I'm not sure how you cook a marginally better steak.   On the side we chose the lobster mac and cheese. Thick melted cheese smothering soft elbow pasta and bits of lobster. If there's any leftover after the first round, you'll find it difficult to not go back for seconds. This is a served in a cast-iron dish.   We also had the Brussels sprouts with bacon. When this side dish first came out, I thought it was tremendous. As it cooled, the sprouts turned soft and not quite as good. Still, the first bites were worth it.   The wait staff made us all feel special the entire evening. I felt that they timed out their rotations well, never to bother us and yet never leaving us alone for too long. Overall, they went to great lengths to make sure we had an incredible experience. I highly recommend The Capital Grille - standing out as one of the best Steakhouses in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Consistently delicious meals and friendly service: what's not to love! Also appreciate that they're open on Thanksgiving as I like to get a quiet table in the bar there so I can have a special holiday meal without the hassle. All of their steaks are impeccable. Their crab and lobster cakes are delightfully savory."}
{"text":"Loved it again.  This is our second time eating here and it has been fabulous both times.  Really enjoyed it.  Service was awesome!"}
{"text":"I had always heard nothing but glowing and rave remarks about The Capital Grille for as long as I can remember. The past few years I have celebrated my birthday with friends at The Steakhouse at Circus Circus and, as much as I do love that place, we decided to try someplace different this year. Enter The Capital Grille. This was a slam dunk of a 5 star experience in every way and left me satisfied after an incredible meal and great memories with great friends!   (+) Service was outstanding! Our server for the evening, Mr Mike S., was helpful, attentive, and personable! He provided great details on options and details of different menu items. Actually everybody was great! Our drinks were always refilled in a timely fashion. The hostess was very friendly and engaging. Absolutely great service all across the board! (+) Food was absolutely incredible! I opted for the 24 ounce porterhouse ($55) cooked medium rare and it was sheer perfection! So juicy and tender. One of, if not the best, steak I've ever enjoyed in my life!  Plus I can't say enough good things about that Lobster Mac and Cheese!($19)  It absolutely melts in your mouth and I could have had several more portions easily! lol I cannot wait to have that again! (+) The room is absolutely elegant and cozy with great views of the strip to admire and appreciate! We were fortunate enough to be placed at a corner table where we all enjoyed the striking views of the strip all lit up at night! (+) We were there to celebrate my birthday and they added some really nice touches to the meal, such as confetti on the table and a nice card thanking you for spending the occasion there. It was quite nice. Plus, at the end of the night, they brought me a nice dessert tray with some awesome cheese cake and chocolate souffle! Very rich and very tasty!  This wasn't just a meal, but an experience! I simply loved my time here and am already making plans when we can go back! I cannot recommend experiencing this establishment strongly enough! Just do it!  5 stars.  Actually, one of the easiest 5 stars ever!"}
{"text":"I didn't leave a review the night of but I wanted to come back to write a short note...  This restaurant has THE BEST FILET MIGNON over all other restaurants I've been too including Herbs n Rye, Echo & Rigs, etc.  I had added the lobsters on top as well, and NEITHER OF THEM NEEDED DRESSINGS!! (I usually eat my steak with A1 and my seafood with butter).  Also, they decorated the table nicely for my boyfriend's birthday that evening.  Excellent cocktails.  Definitely a hole in the wall. I was born and raised in Vegas and out of all my times going to Fashion Show I never knew this restaurant existed. I tell this restaurant to everybody looking for a nice night out with their partner."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place that my bf has taken me for our anniversary.   The service was phenomenal. They knew it was our anniversary and they had rose petals and a card laid out for us on our table. The card read \"thank you for celebrating with us, from the Capital Grill.\" The server even came up to us and gave us some complimentary sparkling wine for our celebration. I was in awe at how well we were treated.   I ordered the veal and my bf ordered the lamb chops. We opted for creamed spinach and Au gratin potatoes for our sides.   While we waited for the food (which was a pretty quick wait) they gave us a complimentary bread assortment which was pretty tasty.   The food came out and I astonished; It looked so delicious! And boy did it taste even better! Both of our plates were bursting with flavor, and the sides were an awesome compliment.   The server checked up on us every 10 minutes or so to fill up our glasses and make sure everything was perfect. When we were almost done with our plates he told us to save some room because they had a \"surprise\" for us. Of course that put a couple big smiles on our faces!  We were just about done with our food when the server brought out a center cut piece of creme brulee cheesecake with a candle placed right in the middle for us. He said it was on the house from Capital Grill and that they hoped we really enjoyed our anniversary.   Mmmm, that cheesecake was sooo delicious! My mouth is drooling just thinking about it!  We had an exceptional dining experience here. I've never had such incredible service anywhere. I hope they stay the way that they are because we'll be sure to come back very soon!  Thank you for making our anniversary so wonderful!"}
{"text":"Due to time constraints we ordered take away for dinner. We ordered shrimp cocktail and lobster tail topped filet. Rebecca who took the order was extremely helpful. Brought food back to the Marriott at Mcdowell  mountain and it was delicious. Extra time was taken to separate the components of the dinner to ensure the quality upon dining and everything was cooked to perfection. If take away was this good I'm looking forward to coming back to dine in."}
{"text":"This was our first time to Capital Grille, decided to try it out for Restaurant Week. We got there early for a 9 pm reservation and surprisingly even the bar was full on a Wednesday night, so we went across the street for a drink. Guess not everybody is in their pajamas by that time like we are. Everything went smoothly, free valet parking, table was ready right away when we got back from our drink, excellent service (almost a rushed feeling though). However, i wasn't too impressed with the Caesar salad and honestly i was kind of disappointed with my filet. Filets are the only steak i really enjoy, but to me this just tasted like a normal steak, nothing special. Ruth's Chris wins in my book. The potatoes and spinach were a good side.  The highlight of the night was the Crème Brulée Cheesecake, it was awesome. Definitely a fan of that cheesecake and the atmosphere, but in comparison with other steakhouses, for me the meal was just OK."}
{"text":"Awesome dining experience!  After a round of golf, didn't really have time to change, so just went to dinner in golf shirt, shorts, and flip-flops.  If you're gonna roll like that, Vegas is definitely the place to do it.  Cuz you definitely cannot pull that off in NYC or Beverly Hills!  Prime beef grilled to perfection!  Had the Kona-crusted NY Strip. . . awesome!  And the lobster mac is unbelievable!  One thing that left me with a bit of a question mark.  Our waiter told us that the menu was all grass-fed???  However, no other info out there seems to confirm this.  The steak itself although delicious, did not taste like grass-fed.  No other info from the company itself.  And no other Yelper reviews confirming it... hmmmm?  Maybe someone can confirm for me?  Nonetheless, I'm a fan of the place.  Would be an even bigger fan if I can get the grass-fed option confirmed."}
{"text":"We have dined here many times and brought a guest this time. The atmosphere in the main dining room is very nice as in a warm gentleman's clubby room kind of way. There are great paintings on all the walls including a great one of Mr. Rogers and there are several mounted animal heads high-up on some walls.    Their bread and the selection is very good including the pumpernickel and lavash. They serve butter that is some the best you can get. \"European-style\" Cultured Butter I would say.  From the Bar we ordered a Grey Goose martini with blue cheese stuffed olives perfectly made and the olives were some of the best I have had. The apple martini was weak for some reason but had good taste. With dinner a bottle of Concha y Toro, Marques Casa de Concha 2010 Carmenere went so well with our steaks.  To start I had the Wedge salad that was pretty good for sure right up there with some of the best. The lettuce was appropriately extremely cold and crisp. While the blue cheese dressing was good indeed, it could have been a little stronger of the blue for my own taste, but the tomato wedges and the bacon were outstanding. The Onion soup was tasty with a great topping of oozy melted crusty cheese.  We also had Wagyu Beef Carpaccio that I would grade outstanding.  Specials of the night are always worth a review and discussion with your server. Tonight, one that sounded great was a preparation of wild pacific salmon, but we were here for the steaks tonight.  My dry age strip steak was a very flavorful piece of meat and the tenderloin with porcini sauce and the poached lobster was a super combination, tender and flavorful, decadent perhaps; just great . The filet that we asked to be treated with the Kona was very good. Also at our table we had he porterhouse which was a good size, nicely done and very tasty. To reiterate a bit, we enjoyed good flavor with all the steaks and all were prepared as ordered.  Service, first and last was outstanding. Our server's knowledge was just short of encyclopedic. Everything about everything on their menu and anything about all the food and perpetrations she was able to recite.  She was very professional, fast and prompt in an apparent effortless and smooth manner. Wine she knew all about, yes she did. \"Oh I think you would want that wine filtered\", so she decanted our wine as her own recommendation for what we had. \"Not going to finish the wine; want it back in the bottle\", not a problem and immediately it was done.  They are very busy on the weekends and when we arrived for our 8PM reservation the dining rooms were at 95 percent full. If you arrive without a reservation you might have a chance to eat in the lounge area high tops, bar, or the few tables in the area.   If you like great dining and great steak and can afford an upscale price; Capital Grill is worth the occasional experience."}
{"text":"I've eaten here and at other capital grills many times. Never reviewed. Although this is not the best place around it is always great. I can't say I have ever disappointed.  Tonight I had the special bone in strip. Cooked perfectly. Would highly recommend if looking for something a bit more exciting than a filet.  On the side we had green beans and mashed pots. The mashed was  absolutely delicious. Some of the best around.  All in all, this place is great. I love it."}
{"text":"We had a group of neighbors visit during restaurant week.  The steaks and veggies were just \"flat\" outstanding.   To us, it was perhaps the best in town. Service was superb.  Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Alex made our experience amazing. He started out by taking a group photo then recommended three entrees (Chilean sea bass/rib eye strips/filet mignon with mushrooms) and four sides (asparagus with lemon sauce/grilled Brussels sprouts/au gratin potatoes/macaroni cheese with lobster) for six of us to share. Perfect amount of food. Then the desserts--creme brulee with berries, cheesecake with berries, double chocolate cake with soaked cherries, and the best: coconut cream pie with caramel syrup. Amazing food for $46."}
{"text":"Where do I even begin? My husband and I went here to celebrate our 15-year Anniversary and it did not disappoint! The atmosphere was perfect. Our seating was perfect. The table was sprinkled with heart shaped confetti and contained a hand written Anniversary card.   The staff was superb. Our waitress was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. She made wonderful suggestions, brought us our courses at perfect intervals, ensured that we were enjoying our evening, and even went as far as to accommodate a tour of the kitchen upon request.   The food was delicious. Delicious actually doesn't do the food justice. We received a fresh bread basket and butter plate while reviewing the cocktail and wine list, as well as the menu. Then, we enjoyed a wonderful prosciutto wrapped mozzarella appetizer, a main course of Kona rubbed NY strip with shallot butter (for me), a porterhouse (for hubby), and Au Gratin potatoes (to share), and ended with the warm apple crostata for dessert.   And they also provided a complimentary champagne toast and mini dessert platter (with the best cheesecake and flourless chocolate cake I've ever tasted)!  This was our first visit and definitely won't be our last. DO NOT LET THE PRICE TAG CHASE YOU AWAY!!"}
{"text":"Love! I'm a huge Ruth's Chris fan but Capital never disappoints. Celebrated my bachelorette party there and was treated like royalty. So sweet!"}
{"text":"I had a fantastic experience here! Wonderful service everybody was on top of their game. Awesome wine selection and our steaks were cooked very well. I will be back."}
{"text":"Totally Family Friendly!!!  Came in with my 7 month old and the staff was just so accommodating.  My meal was anxiety free.  And, of course, great stakes, cooked to order."}
{"text":"Adhering to my new rule of never yelping until I've been somewhere more than once... Last night was our second time at the Capital Grille. Love it! Will be a go to date night place for sure.   5 Star - Service -  As good as I've had anywhere I've been. Maybe better. Which in Arizona might make it 6 star service considering the norms here.    5 Star - Atomosphere - Beautiful old school decor. A real \"white table cloth\" kind of place. Warm and inviting, quiet and comfortable.   4 Star - Food - Better than anything I've had in Arizona but not as good as several meals I've had in Portland/NYC/San Diego etc...So can't give it 5 stars. It's good, but for the price it should be AS GOOD as anything anywhere. Therefore the overall 4 star instead of 5 rating.   Wine list - I'm not great at evaluating wine lists compared to a true wineologist (you know what i mean). I only care if they have what I like and they do. So 5 star wine for me.   Can't say enough about the service though. Really really wonderful at every level."}
{"text":"April 21,2018 Just wanted to say thank you to Gwen, and her staff especially Rich our main server and Demetrius for an excellent time. All the staff at the Legacy Village location Lyndhurst Oh, we're 5 stars plus.  We celebrated our 5th anniversary there on April 21. It was so nice and made so special for us. There were extra personal touches like the card, gold confetti on the table, champagne toast and dessert tray ! Thank you so very much for making it a such a memorable occasion  Our only complaint was that the au gratin potato's weren't good. Taste like a box mix, potatoes undercooked and sauce didn't have a nice cheddar cheese flavor.  We'll be back though!"}
{"text":"I was recovering from a bender, so all I was hungry for was an appetizer.  They do their calamari Rhode Island style, which is my favorite.  It was very good and was larger than I expected, but a little too oily.  My friend enjoyed his steak a lot.  We sat at the bar and the bartender and watched football, laughing at the bartender who was dying along with her team.  I glanced at the wine list and was not impressed, which surprised me for a good steak house.  Not sure if anything about Capital Grille separates it from other Vegas restaurants."}
{"text":"The total package:  top flight service, ambiance, food and wine.  Highlights:  Oysters and shrimp cocktails paired with Champagne. Sliced filet with onions and mushrooms paired with \"The Prisoner\" red blend.  Server:  Joshua... new, but enthusiastic. Helped make the evening enjoyable.  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Until Del Frisco showed up, best steak and best wine list in town!!!  Now...it's a toss up.  Wait staff is extremely knowledgable and friendly.  Go light on the app's, everyone...the steaks are ridiculously large.  They've got one of those wine lists that is made for every single person that can walk through that door...great whites and great reds...excellence whether you're staying under 20 bucks, or if you're budget is big time.  Also, the bar out front is a great place to enjoy some happy hour and watch the cougars on the prowl...fun people watching."}
{"text":"Let's face it: if there is a better a la carte steakhouse open to non-members in all of North America, I want to know what and where!  The chain holds to consistent standards of excellence, known for their on-premises dry-aged prime cuts and superior service. The Las Vegas location holds up its end of the deal.    The atmosphere is what I'd call \"hunt club\" - dark rich woods, elegant but not overstated decor (in this location the unique feature is painted potraits of famous local entertainers). This location adds a 3rd-story view of the Wynn casino and surrounding neighborhood.   Service is imbeccable - timely, welcoming, classy, attentive, & knowledgable about fine cuisine.  Although the atmosphere is elegant and cuisine very high-end, the staff make you feel right at home (even if you arrived in merely a dressy casual fashion). A special mention is deserved for our waiter David.   Ah, but ultimately it's about the food. Let's start off with the Procuitto-wrapped mozzarella appetizer, served over mildly-oiled toasted crisps with cherry tomatoes and banana peppers. The combo of textures and flavors was on the money. My friend had the steak au pouvre with courvosier sauce. I'm not generally a big pepper steak fan but the tenderness, the rich sauce, and the just-right touch of pepper were a winner. My porcini-rubbed Delmonico may be the most exquisite such cut I've ever had; cooked to a PERFECT medium, melt-in-your-mouth juicy, with a delicate sweetness from the rub. Wow!  I somehow found a way to eat the whole cut.  Desert for me consisted of a homemade DARK chocolate ice cream that was so rich it should have come with bodyguards. A hint of mousse-like quality but clearly ice cream. Exquisite!  Overall: As my buddy Matt put it, an experience for all the senses. If the opportunity arises, I WILL return, as I have to the Captial Grille in Denver. My compliments to the staff, and Bon apetite to you lovers of fine cuisine!"}
{"text":"I've been loving Capital Grille for many years now. I was so happy when they finally opened one in Vegas (after being a frequent regular at the ones in Boston).  This place is a very manly steakhouse. Don't take your group of girls there!  It's all about fat hunks of aged beef grilled at extremely high temps and charred on the outside. Enjoy with a nice full Cabernet...  If you dare... the French onion soup (crock only please) is the BEST I've ever had (when I'm there on a good night... even when not it's excellent).   Go there with the guys and order what I always did... not on the menu anymore... 20 oz. NY Strip medium rare. If they say it's not on the menu insist! Don't worry about the size, take the rest home for a steak sandwich tomorrow... the key is the thickness of the meat. More like a mini roast that allows the outside to be nice and charred while the entire center is a really nice red.   Think 'that steak scene in the Matrix' (the movie) and you'll love this place."}
{"text":"Thanksgiving day dinner plate was pretty good.  turkey was a bit dry but large enough portions for leftovers for sure which was nice.  side dishes were excellent as always.  had to ask for extra gravy, but came fairly quickly.  daughters mac n' cheese was a bit blander than expected but not a bad thing considering it was for a child at the end of the day.  service was good, but our server seemed to have to go on break or something for about 1/2 hour 2/3 of the way through our meal which was unexpected.  fill-in waiter was fine until our original guy came back, but the change up was something not expected or experienced before at an establishment of this caliber.  the pumpkin cheesecake special dessert was EXCELLENT!  while convenient for sure, be prepared to wait awhile to get your car back from the complimentary valet service.  It was not busy when we asked for our car and it easily took 15-20 minutes.  overall a nice Thanksgiving afternoon."}
{"text":"Had what will definitely go down as one of my best meals ever here.  We had a big party, but the waiter and other servers were awesome and constantly made sure we were happy.  The calamari here is the best I have ever had, and there was tons of it!  My fish was cooked perfectly, and their deserts were great.  I still have the waiters business card for my next work outing there.  Yes, the waiter had business cards.  Who knew???"}
{"text":"The Capital Grille is everything you should expect when you see $$$$; food, wine list, service, and atmosphere are all outstanding. Last night, against my own advice, we ordered lobster tails even though the CG is really a steak place. They were excellent, but due to miscommunication (possibly on my part), the order was incorrect. Management resolved the issue immediately and generously to our complete satisfaction. Prices, of course, are high, so except for the 1%, this is a special occasion place."}
{"text":"Ten ounce filet was only about 8 ounces. Medium well steak was well done not medium well.  Bernese sauce had no flavor. Longhorn steak is better than a $200 dinner for 2. The mushrooms were very over cooked.  The cream bulee was weak with no temperature gradient and poor custard flavor.  We were quite disappointed The service was excellent. Food disappointing and expensive"}
{"text":"We went for lunch and everything was excellent.  First we had fried calamari which I don't usually eat but I tried their pan fried calamari with out chili peppers and it was a perfect combination.  The calamari was done perfectly, crispy and not rubbery and the cherry peppers gave it just the right amount of spiciness.  I had the lobster and crab burger on a brioche bun and it too was wonderful.  We had a side of their home made potato chips and they were great.  Well worth the trip if you want a fine dining lunch."}
{"text":"I sent my parents here for their 37th wedding anniversary dinner a few nights ago.  They came with a gift card that, for some reason, didn't work.  The gift card is good and I was just re-issued the card by darden.  Instead of trying to solve the issue and figure out a solution, the manager berated my parents and embarassed them in front of guests, showing a complete lack of class.    There are a lot of good steakhouses in Pittsburgh - spend your money somewhere that treats patrons with a bit more respect than this place."}
{"text":"Last night, my husband and friends dined at this location.  From the valet to hostess to server, we have never had a more enjoyable experience at a restaurant.  It was truly a VIP experience!  Our server, Ricky Reyes, thought of every detail - was attentive but not intrusive, knowledgeable and generous.  He was remarkable.  We were in the restaurant past closing and were never once pressured (or even aware) that we were the last patrons.  Each member of the team in (and out) of the restaurant were absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"Unbelievable food and service! Bring the checkbook though, but it's worth every penny!!"}
{"text":"With so many great places to eat in this city, it's hard to choose.  We wanted a steak and seafood place where we could stay on track nutritionally, eat a great meal, and not spend as much as a car payment. While it is part of a chain, this place had its own personality worthy of our sole big dinner out on this trip.  More importantly, the food was fantastic!   I ordered the spinach salad with mushrooms and bacon ($11) and the sliced filet with a fig essence Demi glacé and tiny onions (mid $40s). I initially had food envy at the sight of the BF's gorgeously seared scallops ($43) but my filet was fantastic.   The vibe is very warm and clubby lit by the soft glow of amber pendant lights. Good for a nice dinner with your sweetie or a group of close groups.  This is Las Vegas and the huge windows revealed the over the top advertising that is everywhere.  That was a little distracting but I'm not sure what can be done.  My boyfriend asked, \"What are you thinking?\" To which I replied, \"Just wondering if that's Donnie Osmond in the top high doing high kicks.\"  Just something to keep in mind if you want a romantic spot to bare your soul."}
{"text":"Great service.   Lots of food per dish.   Great view of the strip.  Tasty food and very good wine  Well managed place"}
{"text":"We had lunch at Capital Grille on Camelback, Phoenix. It was not very busy, but we were taken to the table immediately & the waiter approached us right away. I ordered the Grapefruit soda, & my companion ordered a Lemonade. Turned out the Grapefruit Soda was very bland, & almost tasteless; however the Lemonade is really good. I changed it to the lemonade. I ordered the Seared Salmon salad. My friend ordered the ribeye sandwich. Both were very good. Mine was very tasty!!!!"}
{"text":"Capital Grille never fails to impress me. I was passing by the restaurant about 3pm; & they still serve lunch. The receptionist was very friendly & took me to a table. The waiter was very attentive. I ordered the lunch  Ribeye steak sandwich. It was cooked to the right amount of doneness (medium). The outside of the steak was crunchy while the inside was pink & the steak was tender with good flavor. I always have a good dining experience at Capital Grille restaurant."}
{"text":"Ouch!!  It really hurts when you taste the best.  In fact you're probably jaded for life when you taste a plate that would give 'antonEgo' a second trip to his childhood.  I tasted the 'porcini rubbed delmonico with 12 year old aged balsamic vinegar' at the Capital Grille in Pittsburgh an I have officially spoiled my palate for life.  And service by Mr. Horacio Ruiz was truly incomparable.  A rating"}
{"text":"One thing I love about this place..  is David.  He's an awesome server and make sure to look after  your needs. Foodwise.. They  have the best steaks. I love their creamy clam chowder... The ambiance  is so relaxing. Very quiet."}
{"text":"I was disappointed here.  I've had much better Steak Tartare, and my Filet was delivered almost Tartare-like (after ordering it medium).  The sides, except for the potatoes au gratin were unimpressive (the creamed corn tasted like the kernels came straight off the cob). The magnum of Sliver Oak was good, though.  But overall, should have gone to Ruth's Chris."}
{"text":"Geez is this place pricey. It is also sort of a \"tiny food\" place where you don't get a lot for the cost. We only went because we had a huge gift card and still ended up paying more than we usually would for a night out.  Steak wasn't anything special, I wouldn't go back unless someone was paying for me. Staff was plenty helpful and friendly to us even though we were clearly out of our element with the expensive atmosphere."}
{"text":"Flawless service and reasonably priced gourmet cuisine are the hallmark of this fine establishment. I love it here. My Delmonico was absolute perfection, as was the bernaise sauce along with the sides.  My date had the lobster and crab stuffed shrimp, which if you think about it, is the oceanic equivalent of turducken.  Not that I'd ever eat turducken, but her ordering this dish caused me to rethink my entire value system. Maybe turducken is in my short-term future, who knows.   Which causes me to wonder why it's ok to stuff a tiny little shrimp with a bevy of other larger crustaceans in the first place. The turkey I get. It's a big motherfucker, capable of stuffing practically any other fowl inside of it. But a shrimp? If anything, they should stuff it with smaller crustaceans, like krill or something.  Anyways, I forgot what I was talking about. Oh yeah, Capital Grille. There are a lot of older people in here. One old woman in the booth next to ours was coughing up shit all through dinner which really sucked. I turned and gave her the skunk-eye, as if to say; 'Hey bitch, take your phlegmmy-ass outside and let me enjoy my meal', but she shot me a look right back, saying; 'Hey you little wad, I've got more money than anyone in this place and if I so choose, I'll dredge up as much phlegm as I want...now piss off and stop staring at me.'  All things considered, our meal was really good except for Sputum Queen in the next booth. I hope she gets pneumonia if she doesn't already. Bitch."}
{"text":"If you're not vegan or vegetarian, chances are good you've come here for a good beef entree. But a good cut of beef can be expensive, especially when the sides are sold separately. It's the middle of the week and you're low on cash.  What to do. What to do.  You're a carnivore right? Well it's high time you started acting like one, especially if you want to impress that date of yours. Go with the calve's liver. You heard right.  Calve's Liver.  At thirteen dollars, it's the least expensive entree Capital Grille serves up, but by far the most flavorful. Smothered in onions and bacon, this dish will have any purist begging for more with each mouth-watering bite.  And besides, you'll save big $$ on sides since it comes with all the onions and bacon.  You won't find this delight anywhere on the menu, but ask your server. On most days the chef has it available and will cook it to order. I always request well done, and unless you hail from a Twilight novel, owning a real penchant for the taste of blood, I recommend you do the same.  Also, it's worth mentioning how this was the first time I've ever gotten out of here for under a hundred bucks, but I did have to eat baby cow organs. Oh well, at least it wasn't a lung or something.  Here's another useful tip. This location has full-length oil paintings of prominent figures in Arizona history.  Don't let them sit you in the room facing Geronimo. I had to stare at that wagon-burner throughout my entire supper."}
{"text":"Big fan. Great food, very pricey but worth every penny. We had a great time. Great service and great food."}
{"text":"This is one of those places where you just have to let it happen. The service, the food, the comfortable space all come together to deliver a relaxed delicious dining experience. You know everything on the menu is going to be good, and you know the service is going to be good, and for most people it will be a *splurge* with as pricy a menu as any good steakhouse would have.   good for a romantic dinner for two or for a festive group. Elegant but not *whack you up side the head if you aren't in a jacket* dressy.   We found it by accident out walking one balmy evening on the strip. I looked up and saw the windows and could tell from the street what kind of experience it would be. Nothing that will surprise you or knock your socks off. Thats not what  The Capitol is about. Just lux, delivered well."}
{"text":"Grab your rich boyfriend and make him take you to Capital Grille.    The food is FANTASTIC...I had filet mignon and believe it or not the mac and cheese side is to DIE for.  The wine selection is incredibly extensive but our waiter knew exactly what would go well with our dinners.  Dessert was a must too here, we had creme brulee and some raspberry thing that almost sent me into extacsy.  As other reviews have stated, CP is pricey, but hey, you get what you pay for.    Parking is easy, located at the Biltmore they have valet but its not usually entirely necessary.    Service was prompt and polite and everyone is extremely buttoned-up.  A great place for celebrating a special occasion or just feeling fancy."}
{"text":"Never before have we had such an exceptional service from a restaurant in this city and I have lived here all my life.  The host sat us in a area that was to cold for my mother and they accommodated us right away. The waitress was able to take our order and answer all our crazy questions about the menu.  The food came and it was great!  Hands down the best Calamari I've had in a extremely long time!! The chilies in the mix are excellent and taste great!  The Onion soup is enough for 3 to 4 people and was super yummy and not as salty as it has been for me in the past. Now, our main course, our steaks were ordered medium rare and by golly I really like my steak mooing at me- but our steaks came out medium :( -- we were so sad because the meat, seasoning, sauce was great, but man- so, we called our waitress over, I had told her the issue and she was eager to see if the steaks were both medium to show the chef we cut the steaks from the bone to show her. Appalled at the fact that they were cooked incorrectly she quickly headed to the kitchen and the head chef began to re cook our steaks : while we waited our Mac and Lobster side came which was also amazing and had the Largest chunks of lobster I've seen in a Mac and lobster dish! The Maítre D came over and asked us if we would like a glass of wine while we waited but we did not drink and he us over another Mac and Lobster :) ! We were able to receive the steaks the way we wanted them and they were epic!  Desert we also ordered and boom it was great! Overall excellent experience even with the steak hiccup!"}
{"text":"We were craving a steak last Saturday and decided on the capital grille. We made reservations that morning and arrived at 9:30pm. Alex was our server and he did a great job. He explained the menu thoroughly and made suggestions. A few of us took his suggestions and were glad we did. The only negative of the night was my wife's steak was over cooked. We mentioned this to Alex and he was genuinely shocked. He apologized, took it off our check, and comped dessert for everyone at our table all without us even asking for anything. We were more than happy just to have another one made for us but he went the extra mile. Thanks Alex!"}
{"text":"Everything was superb. We had a few hiccoughs as any new restaurant will have but the staff handled it with grace and we were very impressed with the end result.  I had a 24oz dry aged bone in porterhouse for $49. Ordered medium rare and it was cooked exactly right."}
{"text":"Soooooooooooooooo! Good! And the service was awesome as it should be since there is nothing cheap about this place ha! But it it is so worth every penny! My mother and I went for a celebratory lunch for me landing a new ridiculously awesome job with guess who...YELP! ha!    We both got the lobster roll plate complete with a lobster bisque and french green beans! We were craving lobster good you tell!? Let me tell you they do not skimp out on the lob meat either the roll with out a doubt has what seems to be the whole lobster in it and the bisque is to die for! If you order it make sure you get it with the sherry that they offer with it.   Best place for lobster and steak hands down...besides Ocean Club at Kierland lol"}
{"text":"Based simply on the dessert... the MOST AMAZING and now my ultimate favorite dessert of anyplace, ever - the coconut cream pie.   I do not love coconut, and I do not love coconut cream pie - but there is something utterly amazing about this dessert that doesn't make me think of coconut. A great crust with soft filling, then cream on top, drizzled with something amazing and a thin wafer-cookie thing added. I realize this post is not doing this amazing dessert justice, but I highly encourage you to try it!!"}
{"text":"Love eating dinner here before a show at the Blumenthal. Impeccable service. Knowledgeable. Great wine recommendations. Also, if you tell them you're headed to the theatre, they will box your leftovers and store them in their kitchen fridge for you to pick up after the show. I won't go on ad nauseum about the incredible quality of the food. You get exactly what you pay for. Everything a high end restaurant should be."}
{"text":"I was in your Las Vegas location on Saturday night 10/26/2013, and I have to say that I received the best service I have ever had in an upscale restaurant to date.  Having previously been to your Long Island, NY location, I knew my family and I would be in for a treat.  What I did not know, was how immaculate the service would be.  Our waiter, Ralph was not only extremely knowledgeable but also showed the attentiveness and understanding we seek when fine dining.  The food was extremely consistent with your Long Island location, and needless to say, we were all delighted.  The steaks were cooked to perfection, the sides were very generously portioned, and even when we were not thrilled about how our Lobster Tails came out, Ralph made sure that those that were not up to par were replaced and brought out fresh and hot.  Not only will I be recommending this location to all friends that visit Las Vegas, but I will be reccommending all of your loctations as my family left the restaurant feeling satisfied and special.  Ralph and all of The Capital Grille Las Vegas made my father's birthday special and we hope to celebrate many more occassions at another one of your locations."}
{"text":"I've been to the capital Grille numerous times before and while in the area I decided to give this capital Grille a try. On my most recent previous business trip I went to a high-end steakhouse where I had a horrible experience, so I was hoping that the capital Grille would live up to its reputation and previous dining experiences.  And boy was I happy with my visit, it absolutely exceeded my expectations and the service was outstanding!  When you ask for a steak cooked exactly to your liking, it is absolutely perfectly cooked to your specifications. The capital Grille has become one of my new favorite places!"}
{"text":"Only 2 stars because the steaks should have been the star of the show and they were just good, nothing special. We chose the restaurant based on the reviews that we read beforehand. The restaurant itself was beautiful and had lovely views. Customer service was outstanding- Chuck was great! The bread that they started us off with was by far the worst that we've had in any steakhouse. We then ordered the calamari which was very good. After hearing about the two specials my husband and I each ordered one. Unfortunately when they came out they were each cooked wrong. We thought that maybe they just got the order mixed up. He ordered his rare and I ordered mine medium. It wasn't that big of a deal to us so we were just going to trade meals. The strange thing was that my meal came with two 7oz fillets and they were each cooked totally different. We didn't complain because everything still tasted good. We shared the mashed potatoes and they were delicious! We then shared the cheesecake which was super amazing!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Capital grille is one of my favorite restaurants! It has amazing steak, lobster macaroni and cheese, appetizers and salads! My favorite salads are the steak cobb salad and the lobster salad (pictured). They are both so amazing. Also the bread is delicious. Great ambiance, service, and food! A must try if you're in the mood for a delicious steak dinner."}
{"text":"Always great food and atmosphere At The Capital Grille. I've had everything from salads, to steaks, to fish and almost all of the sides, my favorites being the mashed potatoes, the appetizer spinach salad with bacon and tangy vinaigrette, and the truffle fries. Delicious! They have a gluten free menu, but still ask your waitress to alert the chef of your dietary issues. I was told today that the French onion soup without the crouton still has gluten in it from wheat in the soup base, but it is on the GF menu. Loss of one star for that, but at least i asked the waitress to check before I ordered it. They took care of my million of other food allergies with ease and it was an excellent dining experience."}
{"text":"I am a locker key holder so a big fan of the chain.  This location is attached to a mall, which isn't very impressive.  But, the food quality is the same as Raleigh, NC (which is excellent).  Server was goofy and provided several cringe moments with corny jokes.  If it were my party I would have either asked him to stop or have the head waiter replace him.  ***** (5-star) for Raleigh, NC"}
{"text":"We were craving for lobster roll and decided to go there on our last day in Vegas.  This one is in a great location and has good strip view.  Our server was very sweet and everyone there was very helpful.  We were a little disappointed that they didn't offer the same lunch plate as the ones in OC. We normally got a starter of soup or salad and lobster roll for $18.  The lobster roll alone is $22; maybe they have to pay higher rent???  Pan-fried calamari with cherry peppers was really yummy as usual.  For drink I had the Bohemian and it was just ok."}
{"text":"As soon as we were sat we had some of the best service in all of vegas steak houses.  Our server Dominick was super attentive and extremely considerate.   We recommend this highly being at every steak house in town.  The quality of the steak was excellent.  The coconut pie was worth comming for on its own!!!!"}
{"text":"The manger was just unhelpful. We asked if we could be seated near the window or a both, but she said they had reservations until 8:45pm. It's 9pm and she never came back and checked back on us. Was very rude and I will never come back!  Her name is Lisa and has no customer skills'"}
{"text":"Sometimes you have to choose a spot for a special occasion. Last night was one such night . We choose The Capital Grille to celebrate our 39th anniversary and we were not disappointed. Our waiter Rob was amazing and the food was great. Thank you for a wonderful and memorable evening."}
{"text":"I have been to the Capital Grille in Pittsburgh many time.  The staff is professional and on top of every request.  I've been there both lunch and dinner.  The lunch plate is a nice addition( where you make three choices for $18. I had the waygu burger with the French cut green beans yesterday and it was a really nice lunch, served in an expedited manner for a quicker lunch.  Fried calamari was excellent as always."}
{"text":"This is one of the nicest location I've been to. The place is always dim and very low toned. It always has an elegant, classy look to it. I usually always order their french onion soup and sear tuna. Food are great quality and there always valet parking. It's in a great location and you can always shop after dinner. The staff are professional and friendly."}
{"text":"World Class excellence that you can count on at every single one of there restaurants. I use the app for reservation and it's super easy.  Extensive wine list with 90 point wines, try there house drinks  (Stoli Doli). For lunch the Steak sandwich is so good it's offensive.   The bone in ribeye with porcini rub and balsamic vinegar is to die for."}
{"text":"So we went here during a very busy week for the SEMA convention. They have an amazing pineapple infused vodka drink called the Stoli Doli, sounds a bit silly but it's actually quite good. They marinate fresh pineapple and infuse it with Vodka and serve it as a martini. Tasty and not too sweet.  As for the food, it was good, typical steakhouse fair, the seafood tower was very good, albeit pricey at $96 but it worked great for the 6 of us as an appetizer.  The Lobster Bisque was a winner and the chopped salad was good but not great.  I ordered the Filet and it was on par with what a good steakhouse should deliver. For sides we ordered mushrooms, potatoes au gratin, lobster Mac and cheese, and string beans. All sides were good but not home runs. Service was average and they seemed ill prepared for the convention business. They made up for it by bringing us a desert sampler that was tasty but we were already stuffed.  The single biggest complaint is the parking, it's far and walking to the location as I did from my hotel was no simple task."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I couldn't have made a better choice of picking the perfect restaurant to celebrate my significant others birthday! After endless time searching on opentable I stumbled across the capital grille! I've eaten at plenty of their other locations in other cities and I must say that the consistency in excellent food and service has never failed! Upon arriving we were kindly greeted by a gentleman and a young lady who checked us in! I requested a table near the window so we could take in the fantastic views of the strip! We were briefed on our table being ready in a few moments and invited to have a few drinks at the bar! I asked the bartender what was a popular drink and he suggested the \"Stolli Dolli\" YUCK! I don't know how that drink could even be on the menu as a favorite but then again to each is own right? Anyways I went with my regular Hennessy & Sprite and we also ordered a mojito.. Both drinks were just \"OK\" and for $29 I wouldn't expected a lot more needless to say that bar experience was not as good as the dining experience! Once we were seated we were now greeted by our fabulous waiter JEFF! This guy is beyond an amazing and provides some of the upmost world class customer service! He truly made our dining experience a memorable one! The food was delicious! For starters the calamari was out of this world good!! Entrees we went with the Surf & Turf which consisted of I believe a 9oz Lobster Tail and 10oz Filet Mignon, Delmonico Steak and the Lobster Mac N Cheese! Put it this way we had no left overs and even had room for dessert! Above all this experience will definitely have us returning for more!"}
{"text":"I ended up here because the lunch options in Fashion Mall are sparse and because I need a break from Nordstrom Cafe.  Walking in my friend said it felt like Red Lobster. We both did not understand the extremely large awkward menus.   The bread was uninteresting. I ordered the Seared Salmon with avocado, mango and tomato salad. The salmon was cooked well while the seasoning was too simple. I wasn't expecting the dish too be a piece of salmon with a side salad. The mango was pale and not even close to ripe. My friend had the same issue, she was expecting an entree size salad not a side salad with meat in the corner.   The only reason to eat here is because out of all the restaurants in the mall they have the nicest view."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat. We sat at the bar and ordered the brussel sprout salad which was one of the best I have eaten. The steak was just perfect and we ordered some mushrooms and spinach. The bartender suggested a great wine to complement and was very friendly. Will definitely come again when Im in Vegas."}
{"text":"I was looking for a memorable and classy place to have our Christmas Lunch and after passing along a couple of names to the crew we decided The Capital Grille sounded the best.  They were accommodating to our larger group (only 14 of us) even though their private rooms had already been booked and managed to give us the time we were looking for.  Fast forward to the lunch.  Even though some in our party were considerably late they were extremely kind and welcoming.  The food was delicious and the service was outstanding.  I cannot say enough about our server (who was also the bartender) who was very attentive the entire time.  I would recommend Capital Grille for any special event you might have. Just be mindful, the parking is atrocious around lunchtime."}
{"text":"Beautiful, elegant restaurant with an amazing view. Located on the third floor of the Fashion Show Mall facing the Wynn/Encore, the restaurant's location can be a bit of a journey to find as there is no entrance to the restaurant inside the mall. There is only one door- the front door which is outside- that leads you inside the restaurant, but the food, service & ambiance make the journey worthwhile.   The restaurant itself is romantic and classic, with mahogany accents and warm lighting, perfect for a date night or special celebration. The night I went was very busy. I made a 7:30 reservation for a party of 4 earlier in the day, and even though I arrived on time, the rest of my party was running a bit late. Thankfully, the hostess didn't cancel our reservation, and said that they would set up our table once everyone in my party arrived. That was just the beginning of the outstanding service my party and I experienced that night at The Capital Grille.   We were seated in a booth next to the floor-to-ceiling windows that encase a good portion of the restaurant. Our server was wonderful- very attentive, knowledgable and energetic. After bringing out our drinks and the bread basket (an assortment of rolls, crackers, etc.), without asking us, he brought us an appetizer of Shrimp Cocktail, saying he thought we would enjoy it. Enjoy it we did. The shrimp were fresh and plump, and the cocktail sauce had a kick. Very good!   For the main course, I ordered the Lobster and Crab Stuffed Shrimp- Delicately butterflied shrimp stuffed with fresh lobster and crab, lightly breaded, and roasted with a touch of wine. Good, but not \"Oh my goodness, you've got to try this!\" amazing. I enjoyed the flavorful, meaty filling, but I found the dish a bit dry. It would have been better with more of the creamy sauce.   The rest of my party ordered: Double Cut Lamb Rip Chops- Four, flavorful double cut rib chops with a side of fruit chutney (cherry, I think). The portion size was perfect, and the owner of this dish seemed to enjoy it, as nothing was left on the plate.  Cedar Planked Salmon with Tomato Fennel Relish- A fillet of North Atlantic salmon seasoned with fennel pollen, roasted on a cedar plank and finished with lemon mosto and Tomato Fennel Relish. The fillet size was shockingly large, and while the salmon was fresh, the dish lacked seasoning (due to the simple preparation of the fish, which I'm guessing was to highlight the natural flavor of the fresh salmon).   Dry Aged Porterhouse Steak- 24-oz. dry-aged steak. Recommended by our server. The portion was enormous, and while there was a lot of meat, it wasn't the best quality of steak (as noted by the owner of this dish).   Side order of Parmesan Truffle Fries-  Golden fries tossed in shredded Grana Padano, kosher salt and white truffle oil. Crunchy, savory and the truffle flavor wasn't too overpowering. I really enjoyed this side.  Side order of Fresh Asparagus with Hollandaise- Garden fresh asparagus cooked al dente to a most delicate crispness, and served with their own Hollandaise sauce.   Side order of Roasted Seasonal Mushrooms- A hearty blend of mushrooms (Portabella, Oyster, Shiitake, and Cremini), slowly oven roasted with extra virgin olive oil, rosemary, thyme and garlic butter. Delicious.   We also ordered dessert and coffee to finish the meal. Our server recommended the Fresh Berries in Vanilla Cream- A blend of strawberries, blackberries, raspberries and blueberries in a velvety smooth Creme Anglaise. The dessert was light and not too sweet- a perfect way to end a memorable night."}
{"text":"What an amazing steak.  First time I ate at this chain was in Pittsburgh and the food was the same amazing taste in Los Angeles.  Made you feel welcome and not just another head count.  You must go if you have the chance.  Great experience!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and what I can emphasize most is CONSISTENCY... what a great quality to have in a restaurant establishment.  SUPERB steaks, genuine kind attentive service,  excellent side dishes,  dinner roll basket is even great,  the cocktail and wine list are generous, the atmosphere is cozy and elegant, and you cannot beat the stunning high rise view of the strip. My reservation request of a window seat(special for a birthday) was granted, and accompanied by a sweet hand written birthday card last night for my best friend from the restaurant.  And to TOP it off, the server spoiled us with a birthday dessert surprise.  Can you beat this?????? NO. No you cannot.  THANK YOU capital grille.  (I worked for olive garden[sister restaurant] for 5 years and I am impressed with the DARDEN standard being implemented throughout the entire dining experience.  Corny as it may sound, I'm proud to have worked for this company in the past.   Thanks again !"}
{"text":"Tonight we not only had an event in the bar, but dined in the restaurant. Our server Megan Sexton was phenomenal. Seriously, if you want a server who is knowledgeable and attentive she is your girl.  Our food was great. Everything we ate was suggested by Megan & we were impressed to say the least. Mozzarella wrapped prosciutto was phenomenal. The rib eye was well marbled but lacked flavor - still good. The scallops were delicious and the risotto was amazing.  The lobster and crab cakes were good, definitely over priced. (You only get two) The crem broulee cheesecake was amazing - an Italian/new York blend cream was the perfect end to a great meal. The lamp lollipops were wonderful. Overall we were happy with our experience and will return."}
{"text":"WOW!!!  That's all I can say.    Well not really.  Fabulous event.  I've been to the Scottsdale location, but not in quite some time, so this was a great reminder of what a fool I am.  I should be dining here every night!  We were treated to a sampling of the offerings on their new Plates menu...mini tenderloin sliders, lobster rolls, and crab sliders, along with roasted red pepper soup, truffle fries, calamari, shrimp...  All were delectable, but gotta go with the tenderloin here.  Unbelievably tender.  I am also shocked to say I was a fan of the coconut cream pie bites.  Let me preface by saying I generally despise coconut cream pie.  No one was more shocked than I to find this was a little bite of heaven.  And the wine was poured freely along with their signature Stoli Doli (pineapple martini) and Bohemians!  But where CG really excels is service.  Everyone working the event was personable and professional...a tough combination it seems.  And the chef was at the top of the list, answering even the dumbest of questions of mine (like why you age beef to begin with).   So a huge round of applause to all the folks at Capital Grille and to Lindsey for another spectacular Elite event.  With January events at both the Pointe and Capital Grille, we're getting spoiled!"}
{"text":"Much better than I thought it would be, considering it was a chain. The steaks were fantastic. The mashed potatoes were too loose and the green beans were too crisp and needed seasoning. Service was very good and the dining room and open kitchen are well-designed and not too loud. An enjoyable night out."}
{"text":"While I wish the lasting memory of this restaurant was the Delmonico steak in a balsamic reduction (it really was wonderful) the lasting impressions I have of this place was that it was really loud and that it was nearly impossible to get a cab after dinner.   Yes, it's a good steakhouse from a chain of good steakhouses, but the Strip has plenty of good steakhouses that don't take 30 minutes to get a ride back to the hotel while limo drivers try to hustle you for a ride. I'd come back if my hotel was closer or if I had a car. The cab situation is a PITA. But the food really is wonderful."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! my friend and i went here to check out the place and we were treated like kings. My friend works in Capital Grille Seattle and we got the hook up. Drinks was good too and the food are phenomenal! Definitely going back here. The service is top notch! Everyone is nice and our bill was on the house! We ended up eating at least $250 worth food = ]   Amazing place definitely a place to go eat up if you are in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"The Capital Grille met my expectations and then some!  Tuna Tartar, and Spicy Calamari for appetizers is a must.  Had the Filet Mignon and it was cooked perfectly as ordered.  Sides that the table shared was Brussels Sprouts, Lobster Mac & Cheese, Corn with Bacon, and Au Gratin Potatoes.  Desserts that are a must is the cheesecake and carrot cake.  A tie for best dessert!"}
{"text":"Good, but not great.  Service was not good at all.  We had a family Christmas outing with dinner and a show.  The Capital Grille was the family's first choice as we had always had a good experience with past visits to CG.  We were seated promptly upon arriving and then proceeded to wait 15 minutes for ANYONE to stop at the table.  Other tables were being sat and served and we sat and sat and sat.  When we finally ordered drinks and they were served, we let the server know that we had a 7 p.m. show to attend and that we needed to pick up the pace.  No response and service lagged on.....  To make a long story short, the food was wonderful, as usual, but the service made the experience a poor one.  We had zero time for coffee or dessert and barely made the show.  You would think when someone makes a 5 pm reservation on a Saturday evening the staff would realize that you have to be somewhere for a show.  A usually good \"go-to\" place in town was very, very disappointing....."}
{"text":"A very good steakhouse. Definitely on the more luxurious and delicious side of the scale. The Porterhouse, grilled mushrooms and asparagus were superb. Definitely recommended for special occasions."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. The restaurant is bright and clean. The food is orgasmic and the view is beautiful looking down onto the streets of Las Vegas. You won't be disappointed with this choice."}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend here for a birthday dinner we were both pleasantly surprised with how cute the table was seat up along with a card and a dessert at the end of his meal the food was delicious"}
{"text":"In all seriousness, I have heard good things about this place from several people, I kind of walked in and was trying to think what the hell was the theme here, seriously if PETA ever went in here they would close this place down, with stuffed animals on the walls they would have a field day. I would say from start to finish I was thoroughly not impressed. I will honestly say that I will probably never go back to this location. It wasn't even that the food was just blah, but the fact that the staff seemed to ignore me, maybe I was under dressed for this establishment. I guess my money truly is no good here, because I honestly did not feel the staff gave two fucks about me the whole time I was there. Garbage. I grabbed a card on the way out from I believe was the hostess. Torri McFarland...you and your staff from the top down got work to do this place sucks!!!"}
{"text":"Always a great place to dine!  Staff takes care of you!  Jill was great to us. We love the outdoor dining option. Steaks are amazing, seafood is delicious, sides are generous!  Their bartenders make some amazing concoctions!!  Always leave room for dessert, especially the coconut cream pie!    We will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Finally went to the Scottsdale location instead of the biltmore location near my office. This restaurant never disappoints. Food was great & our server Chris very attentive. For the more decadent side, skip the traditional items like shrimp cocktail, calamari, filet & creme brûlée. We suggest their prosciutto mozzarella, tartare, any of the aged steaks (porterhouse/NY strip), ribeye & the chocolate tart. Pretty extensive wine list that complements our food well. Be back again soon...."}
{"text":"I hate to do this to the Capital Grille, but I have no choice. I came with a party of 7 colleagues after a trade show. Service was ok. took everybody's drink orders, but mine. One of our friends was hungry, and didn't realize he had to wait for the spiel before he could order. He asked one of our servers if he could order, and he responded \"no\" and walked away. Lobster bisque had too much flour, flavorless really. Oysters were good, but nobody stopped to explain if they were pemaquid or kumamoto., and left before we could ask. The seared tenderloins were super tough. Filet  mignon was good. Sauteed mushrooms needed salt, the asparagus was overcooked. The only high point of the meal was the lobster mac' n cheese. Absolutely delicious with perfect crumb topping. I did ask to have some of our sides boxed up, and a server accidentally threw them out. Without any questions, they did prepare new sides for us to take - which was really nice, but I might stick to Mastro's instead next time"}
{"text":"Although I did not sit in the dining area, I had a wonderful experience here! I sat in the full service bar and Mark, the bartender, took great care of me. The rest of their staff is very friendly too! I ordered the Grapefruit Buck cocktail. For all you ginger beer lovers (like myself) think drink is refreshing with a good kick :)  For dinner I ordered the Butternut Squash Bisque. I LOVE BUTTERNUT SQUASH. The soup was very yummy! The Spinach Salad was next. Kind of a typical spinach salad, but it was still good. THEN... I had the Lobster Mac n Cheese. I'm not sure what kind of noodle was used, but it was so delicious!  Everything was worth it, trust me. I hold customer service to a very high standard and The Capital Grille did it for me. I hope to visit again!"}
{"text":"Overall we had a good experience. The service was good not great. My beverage went empty many times for long periods. They left way too much time between courses. It took us 2 and a half hours to have dinner. Though I didn't mind spending the time with my friends. The appetizers left a lot to be desired, lobster crab cakes didn't taste like fresh lobster and there was a big piece of shell in one. The wedge salad was just run of the mill, I have had better execution of a wedge at much lower class restaurants.  The steak had great flavour, maybe even the best flavour I have ever had but was unevenly cooked. It was well done with no pink on one side and medium on the other. The desserts were good but didn't blow my mind."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the lamb chops, salad, lobster mac & cheese and sauteed spinach.  I haven't had an opportunity to visit Capital Grille in Chicago yet but I definitely enjoyed my experience in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"It's a great atmosphere and the service was very good. I came here to celebrate a birthday and  left very happy. There are some great tables available by the windows that offer a nice view of the Strip. The $99 seafood appetizer with lobster and crab was only so-so which is why this isn't a 5 star review. I felt the shellfish was rather bland and the oysters were mushy and lacked body. Also on a platter like that,  something other than shrimp should be offered as a filler. Clams? Conch? Something more exotic.  Otherwise, the steaks we had were perfectly cooked and the desserts were heavenly. Try the flourless chocolate cake or the cheesecake with the brulee top. Both were scrumptious."}
{"text":"How have I not written a review for The Capital Grille until now? Three words: Coconut Cream Pie. I'm not even a fan of coconut or these types of desserts, but whatever they put in this dessert is addicting. It's the combination of creamy coconut filling, with a flaky yet soft crust and then the very best part is the caramel. I could eat an entire serving on my own. So whatever you do, don't stuff yourself too much on the delicious steak so you miss out on this dessert!  Now on to the rest of the meal. This Capital Grille has a great location, very friendly staff and a great environment...not to mention the amazing food! Not only do they have a large selection of comfortable booths, but they also have a private room in the back that's perfect for hosting a large group. I've been to a luncheon in the private room before and it was very comfortable.   The steak here is top quality and fresh! It's tender to the touch and better with each bite. I absolutely love their Lobster Mac N Cheese along with their Au Gratin potatoes. Get both and happily roll out of their like I do! My favorite meal consists of a the Capital Grille chopped salad, the Filet Oscar (topped with crab meat), sharing the Lobster Mac and Au Gratin and completing the gluttonous experience with the Coconut Cream Pie. It's worth every calorie and then some.   Important Notes:  - They serve lunch and often do amazing three course lunch specials.   - During the summer, they do dining after dark which means they offer a special prix fix menu starting after 8 PM that includes an appetizer, two entrees, two drinks and dessert all for $50!  - Make a reservation, especially on weekends and during the busy season.   A special fun fact:   - I learned an amazing piece of information about their giving. Every day, they give away all the left over food to a local charity, so no food goes to waste!"}
{"text":"Omgoodness, if you are looking for somewhere to go on an special occasion, this would be my first choice. I took the hubby here for his 30th birthday and he absolutely loved it. It was his first time and my second but the way they treat you on your birthday is extraordinary!! I think we will make it a tradition for both of our birthdays. When we were seating, we were greeted with two glasses of champagne complimentary and a little decoration on the table.   We ordered the famous Delmonico steak and the whole lobster to share along with lobster mac and cheese, creamed spinach and potatoes Au gratin. Everything was amazing. Service was out of this world. Sherry Webb did an fantastic job. We will be seated in her section every time we go back.   When I asked for the dessert menu, we were greeted with an trio of desserts for my husbands birthday! All of which I already wanted to try.   For a special 30th birthday, we could have not asked for an better experience. Great food, wonderful atmosphere and exceptional service."}
{"text":"I had an 8:15 reservation and was told they were \"running behind\" and it might be an extra 15 minutes. Those 15 minutes turned into 45 and we weren't seated until 9, which was well past our reservation. Beyond that, the hostess was incredibly rude when I asked after half an hour how much longer the wait would be. When we were finally seated, however, the service was quick and good. Our waitress Jade was very good. The main entrees were only ok, there was nothing special about them. The true gems were the shareable sides, particularly the lobster mac and cheese. Overall, the experience was only ok and the food was uninspired. Would not go again."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. Come with a heavy wallet or an expense account. The staff is always friendly and attentive. The food is always delicious. The bill is always high. And I always leave feeling it was worth it"}
{"text":"Kona crusted steak.  Bottle of Cab.  Nuff said."}
{"text":"My review is only so low for the Capital Grille because I don't understand why you would get high priced steaks and wine here instead of the casino steakhouses. The prices are comparable but the casino steakhouses just add some great flair and entertainment. Another problem here is Fashion Show Mall has the worst parking situation ever.   Our server Kristen was fantastic and a great time to help out our Capital Grille experience. The Dry Aged Sirloin steak salad is amazing and comes with a great amount of steak. The item is fantastic and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for some steak and salad. All and all the Capital Grille is fantastic but visit it when your in Atlanta, Chicago, New York City and party it up at a place like N9NE while in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Everything I expected it to be for my first time.  Excellent wine/spirit list.  Awesome oysters, filet Oscar - the bread basket is yumyum - service was terrific and the banana cream pie cheese tart amazing."}
{"text":"Date night again!  We felt like fine dining and with so many options out there, we narrowed it down to this venue.  A yelp event we had attended; where CG had taught us the difference between dry age and wet age; is what actually made the deciding factor.  Glad we chose The Capital Grille.  I started with the Caesar salad.  I do not recommend the Caesar salad, it was very average to below average.  It was disappointing that such a place would put out such a mediocre salad.  Moving on... I ordered the Kona crusted bone in ribeye and hubby had the 8oz filet.  For the sides we had green beans and lobster mac and cheese.  The kona crusted ribeye was so tasty,  I will be returning to for this.  But one of my favorite items was the lobster mac and cheese.  Amazing.  Please do yourself a favor and get this.  The green beans were pretty good as well.  Dessert was flour-less chocolate cake and creme brule.  Both items were very good.  Not really something I would order again, but they were good.  Service was excellent.  The manager also came out and checked on us.  From the hostess to the server and manager, all the way down to when we headed out the door, we felt welcomed.  I know that I will be back."}
{"text":"Went here for our anniversary. The ambience was nice. We went early so it was nice and bright. But that was as far as it went for me. They immediately brought bread and butter to the table. When our waiter came, he asked us the usual question what would we like to drink. I asked him for a non-alcoholic drink. He looked at me and said they don't have much choices for non-alcoholic so what do I want. I was kind of offended at his tone so I ended up ordering non-alcoholic mojito. The menu option seems very tasty. I ended up ordering a New York strip steak. My husband ordered bone in ribeye. We also ordered the Truffle fries, and the creamed spinach. However when the meals came to the table. Both of our states were not to the desired temperature. My dear husband wanted his medium rare and it was well done. I ordered a medium and mine was also almost well done. Very disappointed. The manager discounted us 1 Stake. And offered us desert. It was our anniversary anyway so they gave us the usual complementary type desert. So we opted for that rather than ordering a separate dessert ( but there was a bug just travelling across our plate). It was our anniversary as I said and I was pretty disappointed.  I do not think we will be returning. We've had better elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm such a capitale grille fan! So of course I had to come to the one in Vegas for a great nye dinner! I convinced my girl to forgo mastros and try capitale grille for the first time!! So I bring my friends I called and the hostess stated to arrive before 10. We arrive at 9:47 and she stated that she would check to see if we could be served and seated. Thought this was odd but ok so we walk to the bar because she's taking a while to come back. Anyways this would have made for a bad experience because the hostess was unwelcoming, but my friend asked to speak to the manager.  The dining manager Corey came and said that we could be seated in the dining room. I ordered my staple lollipop lamb chops...I loved the fact that my server accommodated me by asking the chef to prepare them! They are normally only for the bar area ! :)   Lobster Mac was great as usual! We ordered sams mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts and asparagus! The mashed potatoes are perfect! They are incredibly creamy! A must try! The Brussels sprouts are seasoned so well and charred with a glaze.    Lastly We ordered the cheese cake for dessert ! So good! I really love the fact that the cheesecake is made brûlée style.  Will definitely be a staple for me in vegas !!!"}
{"text":"Went for my birthday, food was alright. Had the prosciutto and mozzarella appetizer, was pretty good but just a mozzarella stick wrapped in bacon. Had the Ribeye and the wife had the kona strip, both were decent and a little fatty for what they should have been. Flavor and texture was ok but could have been better. Overall was overpriced for the quality of meat we received."}
{"text":"We were blown away by our experience at The Capital Grille. My boyfriend and I have dined at several locations but never this one. Having experience at other locations we knew the food was delicious and thought it would be a great choice. We were in Scottsdale to visit my parents and celebrate their retirement. I mentioned this on the reservation and they above and beyond to make it a very special night for my parents. We were seated promptly at our reservation time. At our table was a nice congratulations card for my parents. As we looked over the menu our server Jill (5 stars for her as well) brought us a complimentary pineapple infused vodka to try. We all enjoyed it but my mom decided to go with a pomegranate martini and we went with a bottle of cab that Jill suggested. Both were A+. Following that we all ordered a cup of soup either lobster bisque or French onion soup - you can't go wrong with either! If you are a lobster fan I'd suggest the bisque which has very generous portions of lobster meat. For our entrees we each ordered the 10 oz filet. I ordered mine served Oscar style which came out perfectly cooked lots of crab meat a wonderful bernaise sauce and nicely grilled asparagus. Everyone else also said their filets were perfectly cooked, tender, and flavorful.  As sides we ordered the lobster mac and cheese as well as the mashed potatoes. We all agreed we could have done without the mashed potatoes but loved the lobster mac. As we finished off the bottle of wine we were delightfully surprised when Jill brought out complimentary champagne and a bite size dessert of what appeared to be chocolate moose and a creme brûlée with congratulations written on the plate. She made sure we'd remember this moment by taking a photo and printing a copy for each couple. The service was absolutely phenomenal. Jill was fantastic and made this such a special experience and once again the food did not disappoint. We enjoy trying upper scale steakhouses but capital grille may have just worked its way into our number one spot. Thanks for the fantastic night!!"}
{"text":"Capital Grille was absolutely delicious. The service was really good. Both the waiter and the managers were attentive and helpful. I went there for Three Square's Restaurant Week and the menu they had for it was a really good deal compared to their regular pricing. We sat right next to the window and the view was great. It was the beginning of summer so it was still pretty hot. All the food was phenomenal. I had the New England Clam Chowder,  Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry Aged NY Strip with Shallot Butter (18oz), Sam's Mashed Potatoes and Classic Crème Brûlée with Seasonal Berries. Highly suggest the mashed potatoes for the table. They were awesome. The steak didn't seem like it was cooked medium rare like I ordered when I first started but when I got to the middle it was perfect. The steak was delicious too but huge! One of the steaks was not cooked perfectly and they took it back and comped the meal... we weren't looking for any of that to happen but the customer service was amazing."}
{"text":"After dining in a private room last night and considering my meal, the Capital Grille missed pretty bad.   The Manhattan was simply disappointing. I skipped ordering the Woodford Reserve bourbon as listed on the menu as there is sweet vermouth in a Manhattan and it's going to be tough for even a high rye mash bill to hold its own. I asked for a rye. Their recipe contains an Amaro which I was willing to try but it simply didn't work. It offered an abrasive aftertaste. The vermouth was from Vye. I've not had that brand on its own but it doesn't hold a candle to Carpano or Cocchi which would be more appropriate for a $$$$ restaurant.   My personal appetizer was French onion soup and it was quite tasty. Especially the cheese but I didn't ask the variety. It was very bread-y and since I'm low carb, I didn't like that but it's on me for not ordering it without or with less.   The Gorgonzola mac and cheese was acceptable...not a good opinion to hold when dining at a high end outlet. The cheese tasted more like a Mozzarella than a blue cheese. Why?  The Brussels sprouts were bland and pedestrian. My experience with them is they are difficult to make well and that's why they should be pretty terrific at a top tier restaurant.   The crab-mushrooms were mediocre too. Where's the vitality and passion in the kitchen? I should be raving by now shouldn't I?  The \"Aspen\" ribeye was ordered chef's choice and came about medium. It wasn't remotely impressive. Grain-y and a little tough. Surprisingly little fat...why on earth would it be trimmed off a ribeye of all cuts? Honestly I make better steak. The one thing they should've delivered on is a great steak for $63. Fail.  I skipped the bread and dessert as I'm low carb. Actually I did have two chocolate covered strawberries. They were okay. Good enough to have a second but again...but shouldn't I be impressed?  The atmosphere and ambiance were very nice. The service was reasonable. I noticed having to ask twice for forks when the woman on my left confiscated mine and I thought it best not to correct her.  My prior meal at the CG ten years ago was fantastic but last night was pretty far off the mark. If the meal was a third the cost, I might give them a pass...might...but our party was swindled last night."}
{"text":"The food is great, very relaxing.  The service staff is not in your face every ten seconds, but if you need something they are right there to get it.  Parking is a little painful, as you will need to valet your car, otherwise your forced to walk about a block to park."}
{"text":"As others alluded to Capital Grille is an upscale steak restaurant. This restaurant hangs its hat on fine steak dining.   Considering how many restaurants are all over the strip of Las Vegas - it was quite a sight when the whole place was packed with patrons.  I had a company dinner here so we shared:  -Lobster mac n cheese - I've had better. It would've been nice if the lobster flavor was stronger. I've had better lobster mac n cheese in NY where we would get chunks of lobster. It tasted like ordinary mac n cheese with the lobster absent from the dish -Au Gratin Potatoes - average -Lobster and Crab Cake - served with a sweet corn relish this crabcake was on par with most crab cake but we hardly tasted any lobster -Pan Fried Calamari with Hot Cherry Peppers - the hot cherry peppers was a nice spin to the calamari but the batter was too thick on the calamari -French Green Beans with Shallots and Heirloom Tomatoes - nice but the green beans were a bit stiff -Parmesan Truffle Fries - the skirt fries were overfried and you could hardly taste any truffle - again - i've had better  and I ordered the Porcini Rubbed Delmonico with 12-year Aged Balsamic  - The balsamic really stood out which was the purpose of the dish but i was rather disappointed that without the balsamic  - the steak was rather bland.  Capital Grille is a chain of upscale steak but I would much prefer McCormick and Schmidt over Capital Grille"}
{"text":"Great service will cost you! What a wonderful experience. The brussel sprouts and bacon are a must have. The ahi tuna was crusted and cooked to perfection...rare! My mom got lamb chops which were huge and my dad got steak and lobster. My hubby got a steak and creamed corn. We had so much food left over. I love how attentive everyone was. I definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Just to let everyone know the capital grille is doing a steak & salad special. They have three different options of salads and steaks to choose from. I got the spinach salad with fire roasted tomato and house mozzarella. I forgot was how my steak was prepared but I got it cooked medium. I paired it with a grapefruit buck cocktail because it was the lunch hour after all. One of the many reasons why I'll keep coming back is the older Caucasian lady that works there. She's so upbeat and has the best customer service skills."}
{"text":"i don't eat meat. however, during this recent Yelp Elite event, Capital grill was one of the stops on a feasting fancy. i was impressed at how professional, in demeanor and dress code this establishment presented itself.   also impressive was how informative the exec chef and the restaurants managers presentation of their meat offerings were.   highly recommended for the serious meat eater."}
{"text":"In love! This even way exceeded expectations. Now don't get me wrong, the boyfriend and I really enjoyed Capital Grill and Yelp before this event, but now my loyalty is pretty much set in stone. Wonderful job yelp organizers and capital gill employees.  Before: Capital Grill=amazing steak  Now: There is a whole world of more mind blowing non steak creations that even a vegetarian could be happy and the steaks are ridiculously special and dry aged losing 20+% of meat which makes me feel a little better that I cannot cook a steak like they do to save my life.  Before: Capital Grill is too expensive for a regular day Now: The lunch menu is fabulous, yummy, and at $16, affordable   I had no idea about the extent of care put into every dish and drink (14 day pineapple vodka soak that is out of this world or the yummy marinated raspberry and delicious grapefruit soda that is just as beautiful as it is tasty). Even the dessert was fabulous.  I would almost say I am happy these events don't come around too often, but it is way worth the calories. Can't wait to come back for more!"}
{"text":"Was in the area on a business trip and this is where my group ended up after a long day.  I'm not a big fan of the NYC midtown location but this one was actually a pleasant experience. They didn't scoff at my steak black and blue request, actually the server agreed that a  great steak should only be eaten that way...kudos to you man!  Attentive staff yet unobtrusive.  My water glass was filled every time it went half full.  Our waiter also remembered our drinks and would just bring another without prompting once he saw the glass was almost empty.    Would definitely go back to THIS location!"}
{"text":"Blown away! I've dined at Capital Grilles across the entire country and this one was by far the best. Fourth time at this location, and service is always phenomenal, but Adam really made the evening a special one for us. Definitely felt taken care of.  Gorgonzola Strip cooked perfectly, and seafood platter was out of this world. Ran out of oysters so they replaced with crab meat which was in my opinion even better! Cheesecake, flourless espresso cake, and creme brûlée for dessert made for an absolutely divine ending. Thanks for a lovely evening, Vegas team."}
{"text":"My girlfriend took me here for My 23rd birthday. This place was so great when it came to the food AND the service. Highly recommended for anyone willing to spend a pretty penny on a great evening. I recommend the ribeye that is cooked perfectly medium rare."}
{"text":"Delicious Mother's Day brunch!!  We had an excellent server who was very attentive and gave us some recommendations on what to select. We started off with a cup of clam chowder, next I chose a NY strip based on our server's suggestion over the filet mignon. I was concerned that the NY strip would be \"tough\" but since it was dry aged, she assured me that it wouldn't be that tough. She was right and I was so full that I bought home the other half. My husband ordered the lobster frittata which was really good. The lobster tails were so sweet!  We have never had a bad meal here and having great service made this meal even better!!!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience at this location. We called for a reservation and told them we were celebrating my daughter's report card. They seated us right away and had a card at the table for her. Also, at the end of the fabulous meal they had a desert made up for her. It was truly an outstanding dining experience."}
{"text":"Solid all around meal. Just landed and was looking for a good first meal in LV. This place fit the bill!  We ordered the a dozen half shell oysters (fresh and delicious) , burrata (amazing) and a 22oz ribeye with all the fixings. Wow. This a solid pick and I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Capital Grille was amazing with exceptional food and service.   I celebrated NYE here and it was great they were still taking dinner reservations even on NYE night.  I would also take advantage of the offer valet service next to the Forever 21 entrance.  There is a quick elevator that will take you straight to the 3rd floor and into the restaurant.   I was greeted immediately with a smile and escorted to a window table facing the strip per my special request during my reservation.    I was impressed with the food too.   We ordered the seared salmon, miso sea bass, south African steak, truffle fries, lobster mac and cheese, and a lobster tail served with butter.  My favorite was the south African steak and the miso sea bass.   It was prepared very tendered and you can taste the freshness with every bite.    Our server, Les Forehand, was exceptional.  He made a good recommendation on our entrees and checked on us quite frequently to ensure we are enjoying our celebration.   He also made sure our drinks are always refiled without our request.   Now the most impressive service i received was his talent in taking pictures of us.   The lighting in the restaurant was dimmed, so he knew the pictures would com out dark.  To ensure our pictures had the perfect lighting, Les immediately grabbed his phone so he can use the flashlight while taking our pictures.  I was so impressed with his help and he did a good job capturing good shots for us.  Overall, i was very impressed with my experience.   My husband also had his bachelor party here and he had a private room with exceptional food and experience just like  my experience.   I would highly recommend having a private special event if you want good service and food.  Bon Appetite!!!!!"}
{"text":"Service impeccable, wine list fantastic! Desert list nice too! Great start to the weekend"}
{"text":"This has to be the most over rated and over priced burger place in the area.  If you really want a good burger, go to Red Robin.  It just isn't worth the money for the quality and quantity of food you get.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"We were a little skeptical when we read that this restaurant was in the food court of Fashion Island.  Come on.  A food court?  We had visions of walking through the food court to find this restaurant.  It turns out that it has its own private entrance.  This may sound petty to some, but when you are spending a lot of money for a meal, the last thing you want is to be walking by Panda Express on your way in the door.  The restaurant has a lovely view of the Wynn, and we could see the mountains to the north from our booth.    The service and food was outstanding.  I can't say enough good things about our server, Francisco.  He recommended the \"Summer Generous Pour\" --  a flight of eight wines -- three whites and five reds.   A two-ounce pour of each wine is served at different stages of your meal.  We especially liked the Chardonnay, and Francisco was happy to pour us a little more.  My husband drank Scotch.  We made just one order of the wine sampling and found it was plenty for the two of us.  My husband ordered the NY strip with the Gorgonzola and truffle crust with a Cabernet reduction.  It was cooked medium rare to perfection.  I had the Chilean Sea Bass in a tomato and saffron broth.  The fish was flaky and tender.  The broth was deliciously savory without being overpowering.  This dish was a lovely, light, and flavorful dish for those who seek alternatives to steak.  We split a side of creamed spinach, noting the smoky hints of nutmeg.  The consistency was just right, being neither too stiff nor too runny.  We finished the meal with the coconut cream pie.  It was very good but, as a coconut dessert fan, a tad underwhelming.  If you want the bomb coconut dessert in Vegas, have the coconut cake at Mesa Grill.  The service was outstanding at Capital Grill.  We didn't want to be rushed and told Francisco that we wanted to take our time.  Dining to us is an experience that should be savored.  Pun intended.    It pains us to see Americans come in to upscale restaurants, scarf down dinner in 45 minutes, and leave.  If you have a show to go to in Vegas and also want a special dinner, have dinner after the show.  It's a crime to have dinner at a place like Capital Grill and choke down a meal in under an hour.  We will absolutely be back to Capital Grill and recommend it to anyone seeking a special meal where you will be attended to as if you were royalty."}

{"text":"The menu has been largely the same since I've been coming here but every time I go I am never disappointed. The cedar planked salmon is great and every steak I have ordered melted in my mouth. The lobster bisque and lobster Mac and cheese are pretty much my go-to's when I go.  I recently had the spinach salad and that was reasonably priced at $11 and came with a savory bacon vinaigrette, which was great.  Bottom line, it's pricy but well worth every penny.  They don't go too outside the box but their execution is always spot- on"}
{"text":"The lobster bisque and the lobster mac & cheese are to die for. They also have great steaks. They do a fairly reasonably priced lunch as well."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Charlotte. Never disappoints, between the fabulous food and outstanding service.... Reed at the door and Michael at the bar. Capital Grill has the secret to,success in the Restaurant business; quality & consistency."}
{"text":"The environment and decor is very nice.  Great view of the strip too but our lunch was over 100 dollars and it was just my gal and me.  We had NO alcohol.  Had two burgers, lobster bisque and an app.  I'm pretty sure the beef had turned.  It made me sick.  The servers are all like robots with zero personality.  They speak to you like you're six years old with that fake-ish tone.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I know it is a chain restaurant, but the food, drinks and service made me a very happy girl.   I had the summer sea bass and I wanted to lick my plate and would have done so with a few more pineapple martinis or another bottle of wine. The piece of fish was ginormous and delicious. Seared perfectly.  The salmon was excellent, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. It didnt have a sauce so no need to lick the plate.  Charles was our waiter. He talked with his hands, very passionate, appreciated his enthusiasm and professionalism.  I gave it 5 stars because it was a great dining experience with excellent service. We wanted to sit by the window and people watch the strip, but after awhile, we forgot the strip was below us.   Definitely a go to place while in Vegas. You can walk off your meal at the mall and spend some more money. Why not. Better than putting it down a strippers g string??? Or is it?????"}
{"text":"Melt-in-your-mouth tenderloin  Lobster rolls on sweet, buttery bread Giant, jumbo shrimp Top notch, professional staff Outrageously generous gift bag  Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I've been here four times in the past week I've been in town for business. This review describes my experiences over the course of my visits. Three times were at the bar, and I had excellent service and food. I had the shaved brussel sprout salad, the French onion soup, a filet mignon, a bone in ribeye, an the salmon on my visits to the bar for dinner. I also bright my wife here when she visited me this past weekend. We sat in the main seating area and had a superb experience. She had a filet mignon, I had a bone in filet. I had my salad and soup for starters and the augratin potatoes and brussel sprouts for sides. We had ice cream for dessert, and it was really good. I highly recommend this place, as you have a very high probability of success for your experience."}
{"text":"I came to Capital Grille for a private party, and it was a delightful time.  I am really glad I wasn't the one paying for the party, as the prices seem steep.  As it was a party, I sampled a lot of foods.  But I didn't eat a full meal.  I'm guessing everything we ate was catered so I'm not sure what all is on the regular menu. Overall, everything was great.  Before the food, the ambiance was quite nice.  There is a main dining area, and there is also a private room toward the back.  The restaurant was set up very nicely, and I would definitely come back here for a nice evening.  I didn't realize it was a Darden Chain, but this is ten steps above Olive Garden and Red Lobster.  Favorite Food Sampled: Risotto Fritters:  I loved these FAR too much.  It's grown up deep fried mac and cheese, and it made me so happy.  Perfect in the cold weather.  It's creamy and cheesey and warm.  SO DELICIOUS.  I may have eaten ten (or twelve).  Other things I sampled:  Two glasses of wine (OK.  More than a sample there.), fresh tomato and mozzarella crostini, proscuitto, smoked Norwegian Salmon on onion pita crisps, cheese platter, and grilled vegetables.  Everything was delicious.  No complaints.  Ok.  I don't get the massive picture of Mr. Rogers at all.  In a place that is supposed to be \"classy,\" it was just weird.  It was like Mr. Rogers was watching me eat.  I mean, local flavor is cool.  But this was just pushing it."}
{"text":"The first time DH and I crossed the threshold of The Capital Grille, it was the hottest day of the summer and we had been hitting the shops at the Promenade and we were very casually dressed and hot and sweaty---ick!  The pretty blonde hostess at the door didn't turn a hair but greeted us as warmly as if we had entered wearing furs and diamonds (not in this weather!)  But after we checked out the lush, dignified atmosphere and sumptuous menu, DH and I decided this wasn't someplace to grab a quick bite (our plan) so we decided to return when we were comfortable in our skins and clothes and had time to linger.  So last Saturday we returned, at the suggestion of one of our Meet-up group members, to try the Generous Pour.  It was a month-long event being put on by the Grille where for $25 you got to sample 7 wines, whites and reds.  It was so late by the time we arrived, we decided not to go for a heavy meal and stick to appys.  Great decision.    I can't say enough good things about TCG.  Greeted again by that nice young hostess, sat in a lightly populated bar and had the very best time!  Our bartender, Matt, was wonderful----very attentive. very knowledgeable about the wines and willing to share all that he knew, and when we stumped him with a question, he brought over Jamie.  I never caught what's Jamie's role is (sommelier?), but again, very wine-telligent and personable and charming.  The staff at TCG just made it a wonderful experience.  We liked some of the wines, didn't like some, but in every case, Matt and/or Jamie were able to tell us so much about the grapes and the winemaking process and the wineries.    Our apps were good too!  We ordered the pan-fried calamari with cherry peppers and the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella---they came out quickly, hot and delicious.    It was just a super experience, we had such a good time (almost 3 hours!) and we can't wait to to go back---not only to finally try the dinner menu (I salivate looking at it, but steak after 8 pm is not conducive to a good night's sleep)---but Matt gave us a tiny sip from this large glass decanter on the barback.  Apparently, they fill it with slices of  pineapple and then add Stoli and let it all marinate and the beverage that comes out of that spout is very cold, slightly sweet and slightly acidic and I MUST have an entire frosty glass (or two) of it while the weather is hot, because I know that will be nirvana.  Plus there are so many items on the menu I want to try---starters like the Waygu carpaccio and the lobster and crab cakes, then entrees like the Kona crusted sirloin, the Chilean sea bass, the porcini rubbed Delmonico, the seared tuna, the filet mignon, the...the...the whole menu!  Oh my gosh, it's seven in the morning and I am craving steak!  We can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"We had an early dinner and walked into The Capital Grille.  They took us right in without a reservation.  Only 2 other tables occupied.  Perfect timing for us.  Our meal was prepared to perfection.  Our waiter was excellent in assisting us with our order.  2 sides with our meal to share was more then enough.  The atmosphere was very nice we felt bad as were in very casual wear (shorts and t-shirts) they never batted an eye and treated us as though were dressed for an evening out.  We definitely recommend this restaurant.  It was a bit tough to find as we had to walk thru the mall food court and then outside the 3rd floor doors."}
{"text":"Cap grille is consistently good from city to city. Service is exceptional and the food is amazing. We enjoyed some Prisoner wine that actually didn't have the crazy steak house mark-up you might expect."}
{"text":"I was shocked this place wasn't packed during lunch like it is in AZ. Not to fear , they did not disappoint ! I always sit at the bar and get their clam chowder which always comes out fast and hot! Bartender who is from Jersey was excellent!"}
{"text":"So far it seems that I visit this Capital Grille each January during the Consumer Electronics Show, and I have yet to be disappointed.  I rarely stray from the wedge salad, and delmonico steak.  The wedge salad is a quarter of an entire head of lettuce, drenched in a ladle of thick blue cheese dressing and sprinkled with one-quarter inch cubes of what could be described as \"bacon bits\".  The steak was perfect as usual.    For a side dish, the waiter recommended the lyonnaisse potatoes, a mix of idaho potatoes roasted crisp with caramelized onions.  The potatoes were a bit on the salty side, but i could not help but eat all of them anyway.  Now I just need to wait until next January..."}
{"text":"I have to say, the best steaks I've ever had have been from Capital Grille. Other highlights are the steak tartare, wedge salad, the creme brûlée, and the wine selection.  The service in this particular location is incredible."}
{"text":"I've been a few times, mostly on business.  The ambience is very conducive to business lunches and dinners.  The wait staff is excellent, the food is good, and the location is very convenient.  Definitely recommend this restaurant, but as others have pointed out, for the prices here, I would choose many other restaurants over this."}
{"text":"Food is superb. Service exceptional. Portions huge, especially desserts ! Ambiance warm, old world. Good place for intimate tête-à-tête or conversation with friends. Only reason for 4 stars is a bit over priced. You'll need to take out a second mortgage."}
{"text":"My fiance and i dined here last Friday during our weekend in LV. This wasn't our first choice for a steakhouse dinner but a family member who lives in the area highly recommended it to us. Let me tell you this place was AMAZING!!!!! The view of the strip at night while you eat is cool. (that is if you're sitting by the windows) My fiance ordered the seared tenderloin and butter poached lobster, the only thing he wasn't a fan of was the portion because this man can eat but overall he was satisfied with taste and presentation. I ordered the holy grail of their steaks, the porcini porterhouse, and this baby was HUGE!!! The steak was life changing!! We shared the truffle fries and the lobster mac n cheese as our sides and both were awesome. Since i had put we were celebrating my fiance's birthday on our reservation, our table had birthday decor and a hand written card thanking us for celebrating with them. AAAAAAND we were given complementary champagne to toast before we ate. If i could give them 10 stars i would. Their service was excellent and the food was phenomenal! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start. Beyond amazing experience. From Start to finish. After dinner we walked over to their gorgeous bar and sat and had another amazing drink. I can't wait to come back. I can't wait to tell people about this place. Just amazing all around."}
{"text":"We arrived just as the restaurant opened, and despite reservation received a seat facing the parking lot, not the strip. 5 or 6 groups arrived in short order, and they were all seated at adjacent tables instead of spreading them out a bit, so the noise level was higher than it needed to be. Great food, except for the appetizer lobster tails which was overcooked, and the cocktail shrimp which were borderline. Still, the Cold Shellfish Platter was a great value, and especially the Beef Tartare was fantastic. Entrees were great as well (scallops and Tomahawk Ribeye).  Would go here again, although at a check of $325 incl tip for two, the above mentioned issues should not have been present."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to head off to Phoenix from Anaheim, CA for our 5 year anniversary this past weekend.  I've heard of The Capital Grille before, but this was our first time.    While making reservations Saturday morning, I wrote a note about it being for our anniversary.  We got into town later than expected that evening so I called ahead to warn them of our late arrival, to which the gentleman on the phone replied, \"that's fine... we will see you soon and your table will be ready.\"    We arrived about 20 minutes late, but our table was indeed ready for us immediately.  The host was extremely nice and greated us with a, \"Happy anniversary,\" at the door (girlfriend was impressed).  Once we got to our table we noticed they had placed heart-shaped confetti, a rose, and a card that read \"Happy anniversary.\" (girlfriend even more impressed).    Our server, 'Coco', was absolutely amazing!  Very kind and helped us with any questions or concerns with a wonderful and bubbly attitude.    I ordered the bone-in ribeye and my girlfriend ordered the filet.  We also had the brussel sprouts and grilled mushrooms as sides.  As we waited for our meals (which wasn't more than 15 minutes) the chef sent us a couple of special hors d'oeurve appetizers; salmon and cheese on fresh crackers.  De-lish!    The steaks were cooked perfectly medium-rare to our liking and had the most amazing flavor (gotta love that dry-aged prime beef!).  The sprouts and mushrooms were melt-in-your-mouth delicious!    Another surprise...  After we finished off what we could of our entrees and sides, they brought out complementary champagne and an amazing chocolate cake with ice cream and marinated cherries for dessert for our special occasion.  The dish had \"Happy Anniversary\" written on it with chocolate (yes... I ate that too lol).    This was definitely one of our best fine-dining experiences... possibly THE best.  The staff, the food, the decor, the quick and outstanding service, and the extra effort... blew me away!   We will definitely pay another visit next time we are in Phoenix.    Thank you so much for making our anniversary dinner a night to remember forever, Capital Grille - Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I ordered I drink that they ran out of. The bartender asked if she could top it off with something that was more high-end but they had right there. She ended up charging me for the high end drink. We ordered a salad which was fabulous. Asparagus which were beyond salty and then a steak which was just average for a high-end steakhouse. The service was just okay."}
{"text":"The Capital Grille is an upscale place. The food is good and the service is amazing. I had one bad experience in all my times going, but the response from management was so awesome, I can't even count that against them. Capital Grille used to me my number one go to spot, but I'm not sure it's worth the cost anymore. The steak is always delicious but their sides could be better. I have to say their cheesecake is my all time favorite cheesecake! I'd recommend you give Capital Grille a try if you haven't. It's a nice experience, just don't think I'll be going as often as I used to."}
{"text":"Wow, excited but really dissapointed.  To start made reservations early in the night.  They took us to a bday table, it wasn't our bday? Then they left us standing in the middle of the restaurant.  From 6:00 to 6:20 no drinks, but a basket of bread, though not even a drink menu.   Food was lackluster, very heavy in butter.  Dirty plates were never removed from table and our bill was incorrect.  For the price point it's not worth it in my opinion.  We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 12 people but service was great. Our waitress went over about 8 things from the menu and did it so well that I wanted to try half the things she mentioned. It was very slow service, however, and that was probably the only complaint I had.  I started with a few oysters which were fresh and well prepared (cut well, no shell bits, etc) with vinegar (one of my favorites) as well as horseradish and cocktail sauce. The spinach salad was great, nice hot dressing but the spinach wasn't too wilted either. Bacon bits were good. I had the steak, of course, which was just a little bit beyond medium rare but very good anyway. I do think their spices on the steaks are not as good as other steakhouses but the meat is great. The sides were good, mashed potatoes and string beans. Sides were a little small for the price, I think. Overall, great."}
{"text":"My boyfriend chose this as our \"fancy\" date night while in Vegas. I had given several very subtle hints that I wanted to try the one that just opened here in Cleveland so I was thrilled when he found one in Vegas and said we were going! Our reservation was for 7 and although we were a couple minutes late, we were seated right away. Our server, Mike M., came over and greeted us immediately. He told us some of his recommendations and brought us over a drink menu. I got a glass of cab and my boyfriend got the In Fashion which is their take on an Old Fashioned. Cab was great. His drink was a little strong but I guess that's never really a bad thing haha. For our entrees we ordered the filet mignon, dry-aged strip steak and au gratin potatoes. Food came out quickly. I ordered my steak medium but it was cooked closer to medium well. It wasn't too bad though so I didn't say anything. The steaks were flavorful and tender. The potatoes were amazing!! I really wanted to try the Brussels but the bf doesn't eat them and it would have been too much for just me so I'll get those next time when I'm not stuffed from two days of Vegas eating. Sad there was no room for dessert either. Service was top notch. Everyone from the hostess to the busser/food runner was friendly and Mike was amazing! Very knowledgeable about the drinks and wine selection and made great conversation. Overall great experience. Can't wait to check out the one in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"The Capital Grille is very consistent with their food and service. The PAN-FRIED CALAMARI WITH HOT CHERRY PEPPERS are to die for, I love 'em. Also the WEDGE WITH BLEU CHEESE AND SMOKED BACON is my favorite. The Capital Grille is a great place for couples or a large event."}
{"text":"Classy, impressive, and superb steaks!  I've been to the Capital Grille a few times, and they are consistent with the high quality of their food.  You can pick anything on the menu, and you'll be impressed.  They have a vast wine list too.    I had the dry-aged Sirloin Steak with Lobster Mac 'N' Cheese and creamy spinach sides.  Everything was excellent!.    This is a place to impress clients, or your date.  The room's dimply-lit interior is decorated with dark mahogany wood, and paintings that look like they're from the 17th century.  The leather booths and tables all have white tablecloths with inviting wine glasses.  The servers are well knowledgeable about the menu, and their steak preparation.  They are very attentive too.  I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I took my daughter here for her 6th birthday.  The employees really embraced the event!  They set the table with birthday confetti, had all signed a card beforehand, and were very kind and accommodating.  The chef prepared a few extra treats for us, including mini grilled cheese sandwiches that were quite delicious.  The meal was delightful as well, of course. Our server made wonderful recommendations that were kid friendly.  The appetizer, the muses, the main course, and dessert were all spectacular.  Highly recommended for any occasion."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to go for a special occasion! Start out with a Pineapple Stoli Doli Martini, 2 of these and you will be feeling right! Then for apps we always get the calamari and shrimp cocktail, you would think shrimp cocktail is played out and boring but they are HUGE shrimp with an awesome spicy cocktail sauce. I always get the crab stuffed lobster and we split sides..I've had all before and love them all. Mashed potatoes, asparagus, creamed spinach, but if you never come here you HAVE to try the lobster mac and cheese. To.Die.For. Then finish off with a desert that I will usually take home and eat some later once my food has digested a little, a huge piece of chocolate cake or my favorite, their rich and delicious cheesecake with berries. It is always a lot of food but we love to splurge on special occasions. Birthdays are fun too because they will have your table decorated in fun confetti and always make you feel special. Fun night out!"}
{"text":"My FAVORITE restaurant ever!!!! Prices are high- not extremely but still high- but hey what do you expect... It's Vegas. Service is fantastic and the chefs always cook everything to perfection (at least in my experience)... Highly recommended. Just to give you an idea... Our meal for 2 consisted of a wine sampler special x2, 2 appetizers, 2 steak entrees (I got the filet Oscar *yum!*), 2 or 3 family style sides, and a mini dessert sampler- after tip we spent roughly $230... I can't remember exactly... I think out meal was about $180 and we tipped the rest. You can definitely go there for a heck of a lot cheaper but we wanted to go all out :)"}
{"text":"Somehow my review got moved to the Yelp event page. Reposting here...  Every once in a while, you have an experience at a restaurant that's so lovely, you know you'll remember it for years. The meal we ate at the Capital Grille this week doubtlessly falls into this category.  I know that Capital Grille is a chain, and an expensive chain as well. I'm not usually super excited about corporate steakhouses (Ruth's Chris: meh), and I usually wouldn't have chosen one for a Restaurant Week outing. However, Capital Grille treated us so well during the Yelp Generous Pour event, we decided to return. I'm glad we did: the food and the service were both amazing.  I'll talk about the food first. Their Restaurant Week menu is not very varied: they offer three steak entrees and one salmon dish. However, I don't see that as a downside, since if you're looking for something lighter and/or vegetarian, you're not going to go to a steakhouse, anyways. For my entree, I ordered the Kona-encrusted sirloin with shallot butter.. oh my. This was a good steak, folks: tremendous flavor and perfectly cooked. I've learned that this steak is on their regular menu as well. This could be bad for my credit card. The appetizer of clam chowder was good, if not exceptional. My dessert of creme brulee was delicious. Nevertheless, it was all overshadowed by that steak.  Ok, now let's talk about the service. Yes, my steak was amazing, but you can get an amazing steak at other venues. What really set this night apart was the level of service we received. Even though it was Restaurant week, and even though we had nibbled and sipped for free the weekend before, we were treated as well as they could have treated any bank executive or local politician. Our waiter, James, was unobtrusively attentive and poured us multiple glasses of wine on the house. The manager checked in on us and shook our hands on the way out. I've never been treated better in a restaurant, especially when eating a meal at such a considerable discount.  In case you can't tell from the above, we really had a fantastic evening. I suspect that we'll be back the next time we have an excuse to splurge."}
{"text":"Great great great!  Just get a table and don't try to wedge in at the bar when they are busy. You might never get your wine poured!"}
{"text":"My fav place to go for steak and asparagus. If you request them to not use oil, just steam it... they will and it always turns out very well. Nice environment here at the Biltmore grounds."}
{"text":"What a wonderful dinner for our anniversary!  Service was fantastic, everything we ordered was delicious, and the staff went above and beyond to make our celebration special! My husband's kona bone in steak was perhaps the best one he's ever had! Lobster Mac and cheese was as great as we remember it, and the flourless espresso cake is still one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"Food is great here, best steaks around. Service is lagging, they are very attentive at the beginning but never came back long after the main course was finished by everyone. Additionally, we had a large party of 10 , ordered two bottles of wine and without asking they opened two additional bottles and kept pouring. Watch your bill at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Disappointing ... I really enjoy The Capital Grill most times and this experience left a poor taste for the Charlotte location. Our service and the food was, at best, two-star. I know I did not have the steak but typically I can count on this chain to deliver a good meal - if not great (my last visit in Downers Grove, IL in December was fabulous).  When we were told we could not get a table for an hour we decided to sit at the bar.  After about 15 minutes the host said he could seat us - we should have been suspicious at this point. We went outside to our table that had trash and leaves around the edges of the patio (hey, wait they didn't just blow there last night).  Our tablecloth had stains and spots on the silverware.   It took a good 15-20 minutes for our server to come take an order after bread and water were dropped. We asked to start with the fresh mozzarella, tomato, and basil with 12-year aged balsamic. When it arrived it was two neat stacks on one plate and one empty plate. When we asked the server why it was not split his response was \"we can't split this salad.\" Ok - not as if we asked to split an escargot- the salad was almost perfectly portioned for two. Not to bother we just shared. The sliced tomatoes were mealy and flavorless and only one leaf of basil per stack. There was a nice marinated grape tomato as a garnish but I didn't pay for a tasty garnish.   The main course we tried the grouper special. I've had better. The grouper was ok (notice the theme) but the shrimp that came with the special was overlooked and tough. Our sides - sautéed spinach and the wild mushrooms were good. We ordered a 1/2 order of both which is just perfect for two people. My only comment is we pulled eight whole cloves of garlic out of the spinach before eating it. Vampires beware ,,,  Our drinks were never tended too and the front server never bothered to follow up on the salad. I hope everyone inside had a better experience."}
{"text":"Amazing! My husband and I celebrated our 6th anniversary on Saturday at Capital Grille. The food was great but the service was even better. Thanks Rich for making our evening so special! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We made a reservation to have my sister's 21st birthday dinner. Our experience was great. Our server was awesome! He was very attentive, informative and he made many suggestions for us. We were a party of 5, 4 of us shared two lobster mac and cheese, and our other friend requested a \"vegetarian\" plate which she enjoyed very much--mixture of vegetables and a side of mashed potatoes. I also had a cup of the clam chowder. We all shared our food. My favorite was the mashed potatoes! Haha but the lobster mac and cheese was great as well. The view was also a plus! Great place and experience, would come here again so I can try their steaks!"}
{"text":"Incredible wine list and service... hands down, best high end restaurant in Pittsburgh.    My hubby and I don't splurge too terribly often, but when we do, man do we love CG.    Don't miss the Porcini Rubbed Delmonico... or the calamari or asparagus with hollandaise or the seared tuna or the Creme Brulee .  Ok, ok, you get my point.  you can't go wrong with this place.  One of the best points about this place is the wine list... we're impressed with it every time we read it.  We're wine-ohs and this place satisfies our cravings, which is difficult to do in this uber conservative blue law state.    Do yourself a favor, go a bit before your reservation and sit at the bar for a drink.  It's easy to make an evening out of this place and you won't be disappointed when you do!"}
{"text":"The aged NY Strip is a little overdone.  Medium is not grey by the bone.  You definitely need to order one down from you normal steak house.  The staff were great, sides and appetizers excellent.  Rueben was very attentive and responsive to wine refills.  Water was quick.  I just have a little reservation, due to steak medium well.   Great flavor.  I received a second steak which was much better temp but still a little on the done side.  Just order the one below.  Still a great place, just need to step it up in the Biltmore area.  3.5 for steak, 5 for service and everything else.  Price is not inexpensive."}
{"text":"Whatever Yelpers want Yelpers get And Capital Grille, Yelpers want you!  I've made up my mind to have no regrets Recline myself, resign myself, I'm not through yet I always get what I aim for And your food is what I came for!   Nice classy touch as I walked in with a swagger.  Sham-pania sir? Why yes Lurch!  Kudos to Lindsey! Capital Grille was definitely different.  I really enjoy dressing up, but I wish it was little cooler to bust out my blazer, but all is well.  Did anybody checkout the ice sculpture of Yelp -- that was impressive!  Made my random shot of the day!  Sandwiches were amazing, my favorite with the crab cake sandwich yum!  I love crab cakes, but who know to put it between a bun and make it a burger.  The Filet sandwich was soft; I thought it would've slide right off after the first bite, but nope!  The raspberry champagne was best I have to add. - Enjoy"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on Valentine's Day with a reservation and still had to wait in the bar for awhile. The staff were slow and the food was subpar. I ordered the lobster tail out of the shell, which was good besides picking out pieces of the shell and a side to \"share\" of the mac and cheese that was not a sharable size IMO. My boyfriend ordered a dry-aged NY strip medium, which came out very bloody and probably would be considered rare by many, which he sent back, then waited forever for it to look the same way. I understand they were very busy this night but the quality should not have been sacrificed as a result. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars. Never disappointed at a Capital Grill. 2nd time. 1st was in Sarasota, FL. Tonight was great. My son and daughter in Law treated us. We did make early reservations for 3:30pm. With extra traffic we called and let them know we were running 15 minutes behind schedule. They were more than gracious. Seated quickly. Both servers were extremely attentive and experienced. Food was excellent and prepared exactly as ordered. No room for dessert. Great for adults, leave the kids at home for this stop."}
{"text":"Beautiful location, service, The Best and absolutely Best Old Fashion I have had but for the price I expected nothing less! The Server was an expert at his craft and knowledge of the wine combinations with the meal - The Meal was good! I mean it was Good! But again it maybe just me... It wasn't something I would  miss if it closed! Nothing stood out as a unique character of taste! It was good but for the Price it should! I think as a consumer your looking for that combination of great food, reasonable price and location decor. It's a Grand Place for that Special occasion"}
{"text":"We had an incredible anniversary meal here.  The service was spectacular.  Our server Michael was phenomenal and when he found out it was our anniversary, a rose, a card and confetti were delivered.  For an appetizer we tried to prosciutto wrapped mozzarella with heirloom tomatoes and balsamic.  It was delicious.  The rich creamy cheese was complimented by the salty, crispy and thin meat and the punch of acid from the tomatoes and rich vinegar with fresh basil was out of his world.  A wonderful start to an amazing meal.  Our main courses followed suit.  We ordered Seared Tenderloin with Butter Poached Lobster Tails. Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry Aged NY Strip with Shallot Butter.  The lobster and tenderloin were perfect.  The Kona Crusted NY was approaching over cooked/bitter on the outside.  I contemplated sending it back until I cut in to the middle where the steak was perfect medium.  However the outside and the ends were over cooked.  The soy glazed Brussel Sprouts with bacon are so incredible.  I liked them as much as the steak.  And the mashed potatoes were creamy and divine.  We were surprised with a special desert sampling that was small, rich and decedent.  The highlight of the experience was the service.  We were blown away by it."}
{"text":"First time at a capital grille, overall great experience. For a high end restaurant, it's about what I thought it would be in terms of food and service. Had a reservation and was seated promptly. I want to say we got very lucky and had an amazing server (Mithoon) who knew the menu perfectly, had a great sense of humor, and was very personable.   As for the food, table starts with assorted breads and butter, Fiji bottled water and sparkling bottled water. I started with French onion soup. Very good but I was hoping for something different/better, not that it was bad, but honestly average. The Caesar salad I thought was delicious and light, and I enjoyed their style of croutons (not box kind).  For the main course we shared a dry porterhouse, without seasoning, just salt, cooked medium rare. I thought I was excellent and cooked perfectly. If you want to enjoy it, you need some sides. Top recommendation is lobster Mac and cheese, one of the best  I've ever had. Other great sides are the o'graten potatoes and mash potatoes, I prefer the regular mash, so creamy and perfect with the porterhouse. If you like brussel sprouts, I also highly recommend them; it's a soy based sauce and there's nice chunks of bacon in there that are heavenly. The mushrooms were just okay, not a wow like the rest.  For desert, tops is coconut cream pie, and I'm not even a huge coconut fan, but you must try. Double chocolate cake takes second, kind of like an open lava cake, comes out hot, and with the vanilla ice cream you got a hell of a nice desert. Also tried the flourless chocolate cake, it's super rich and in the hard side, not creamy at all but delicious. This is a great gluten free option.   For the wine drinkers, they have a nice cellar, but it's byob and they charge a corking fee, and they bust out the decanter.   Free valet outside the front entrance, otherwise street parking. Clean bathrooms, great staff, I would come here again!"}
{"text":"I would give this Capital Grille location no stars if possible. I don't mean to be harsh, but I expect A LOT more out of restaurants that charge this much for their food. My mom, brother, boyfriend and I visited Capital Grille, mid-May, for an early birthday dinner for myself. We have never dined at a Capital Grille, but have been to the Palm several times, as well as BLT Steak restaurant group. This was our first experience and last one. We wasted almost $500 on this horrendous dining experience. Number one, we ordered a bottle of wine, it literally took our server, Ken, around 20 minutes to find the bottle of wine in their cellar. We were seated near the cellar where he was searching for the bottle, and watched him. At one point he became flustered and went to check on another table. Finally, he came to table with the wine. My brother and boyfriend started with the French Onion soup, it was decent, but overpriced for what it is. I started with the Lobster Bisque, which had to be sent back because it was cold and had butchered overcooked lobster floating on top. Ken returned with a proper bisque at the correct temperature, also decent but overpriced. My mom had the Spinach salad, very small portion, and the knife cuts were a joke. Mushrooms sliced at different widths, onions, some sliced thin, some sliced thick. Mediocre at best. We didn't even mention the salad until the end of the meal, when things had just become too much. The excuse we received was that this was the \"corporate recipe\", this is how corporate wants the vegetables sliced, in random different sizes, isn't it about presentation, especially when you pay this much? My brother ordered the Dry Aged Porterhouse, my mom ordered the Kona Crusted Dry Aged Bone In Sirloin, and I ordered the Delmonico. We also ordered their \"signature\" potato gratin, creamed spinach, and the Truffle Fries. Unimpressed in the quality and flavor of meat, I'm not sure if they were even serving Prime that day. Maybe a corporate decision? The gratin was a joke, topped with crushed potato flakes, seriously? Creamed spinach mediocre. The Fries were very good actually, but how can you mess up fries? The most disappointing and shocking moment is when Ken tried to argue with my boyfriend that the steak her ordered, the Dry Aged Steak Au Poivre, which he ordered rare, and came out medium, was rare, until he took to the kitchen and put it under the light. Then comes back to tell us that the salad is on them since we hated it, which my mom only said that it wasn't the best and it wasn't the worst spinach salad she has had. They gave us an on the house coconut cream pie to go. Which I took one bite when I got home and threw it away. Very disappointing when you spend this much money and receive this type of service and quality of food. We might as well set $500 on fire."}
{"text":"This isn't a Las Vegas hot-spot restaurant necessarily with modern décor and an avant garde menu, but this is a great, traditional American steakhouse. While I've never had a steak dinner here, I have had their Signature Cheeseburger, which is outstanding and definitely one of the best burgers out there.  The meat is top-grade and even has some smoked bacon blended into the meat to add that certain something to make it special.  It's topped with Havarti cheese and served on a toasted, rich and slightly sweet onion roll.  The burger is juicy and flavorful and perfect for satisfying a large appetite.  The fries that arrive with it actually do help to clean the palate a bit with it's more subtle flavor.  I also had their Potatoes Au Gratin, which were creamy and delicious.  I enjoyed my experience here and will probably be one of those restaurants I'll always want to come back to since the burger is so good!"}
{"text":"I took advantage of the restaurant week to try out this restaurant.  There are several other steak restaurants closer to my house and never had an opportunity to try this location.. After my visit, why did I wait so long to try here?  They have complimentary valet, and I recommend using this service.  Parking across is $2 or free with validated ticket for up to two hours, or park so far away and walk... or just pull up by the entrance and enjoy great valet service.  When we finished dining, the server suggested to give the valet ticket to him so by the time we were outside, the car was already ready waiting and we didn't have to wait for a few mins.  Very nice service, especially when I didn't want to walk more than 10 steps with my heels.  We arrived a few mins before our reservation time. It was Saturday peak dinner and they were busy.  We found two stools in the bar area and started enjoying our drink. The bartender was very nice and offered complimentary bar nuts.  They were sweet and spicy, so yummy I thought I could get addicted to this nuts.  They had our table ready 20 mins after our original reservation time, and apologized for the delay.  They offer black or white linen cloth napkins depending on the colors of your clothes.  For the restaurant week 2015 menu, they have a choice of salad (wedge or caesar) or soup. Entree of two types of steak, fish, and can't remember the last one. Entree comes with two side dishes of mushed potato and sauteed green beans.  To finish the meal, they had three different choice of desert.  Wedge salad I had was very good, creamy dressing complimented lettuces and crispy bacon.  I actually became full just after finishing the salad. (Must be the bar nuts? or could be large lunch I had earlier).  I ate about 1/3 of my steak. Too bad I wasn't hungry enough to finish it. They used very good beef. I could taste a very good beef.  I asked them to put my desert to go as I couldn't even eat my steak, but I tasted my friend's desert, Crème brûlée.  They were really good.  I ate my desert a day later, and my espresso cake was good as well.  Service was excellent. I mean really excellent. I can't even find one thing to complain.  Capital Grille is located throughout the United States. If the service and food is consistent everywhere, this will be a great place to dine for many different occasions."}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate my another workplace achievement today and this particular Capital Grill was a perfect place for an occasion like that.  I've been here several times and always pleased with quality of food and excellent service I received. I really like their hot towel they give you after your meal. A server squeezes lemon on the hot towel, my hands feel so fresh after that.  Food I had here was consistently good, tried different menu each time, never had a miss here so far.  My favorite part is their signature cheese cake. I had one today too. Their signature cheese cake is so fluffy, moist and soft, berry sauce nicely compliments the cheese cake. I always think how I wish I could lick that plate. I used my fork to scoop up that sauce as much as possible to really enjoy the desert."}
{"text":"Above and beyond excellent service, the staff is impeccable, the food is incredible, the wine selection exceeded our expectations, only been there once but what a great experience we will be going back I recommend this place to everyone,,"}
{"text":"I'm not a steak eater but I love it here.  We make it a point to come here at least once a year for the Generous Pour, which is a very generous sampling of up to 8 wines for $38 with the cost of a meal.  This year there were 3 whites and 5 reds.  I sampled them all, and they were all delicious.   Then you can request unlimited refills of your favorites!  How can you beat that?!  I also love the service here.  Your wait staff is attentive and friendly and very knowledgeable about the food and the wines.  I could eat an entire bowl of just the mashed potatoes.  Creamy and delicious, I'm sure they are full of butter and cream (a fact that I choose to ignore).  I always opt for a fish dish for my main course and everything is good, although outdone by the aforementioned mashed potatoes.  I also tried the cheesecake with fresh berries and it was to die for.    Believe me, it's worth the cost!"}
{"text":"Steak tartar is killer and an amazing wine list"}
{"text":"Service is great, but the steaks did not leave such an impression. The sirloin steak, Porterhouse, and the rib-eye like Delmonico were just OK. The steaks seem to not hold their juice, and they don't have that steak taste to them. We all ordered them medium cooked as well."}
{"text":"Amber was the key to the success for an awesome evening out. I left my order to her after I stated I wanted a large portion of beef which was full of flavor and juicy. After a couple questions she put together an awesome meal where all I had to do was relax and enjoy.   Thank you Amber at The Capital Grill in Charlotte North Carolina."}
{"text":"I think this replaced a Irish pub at Legacy Village.  The interior and exterior of the new building is beautiful.  The food is average for the price point.  I ordered the bone in ribeye, the steak was not as good as some other local places of the same caliber.  The service was also not up to par, maybe it's because they are new.  Would more likely not go back."}
{"text":"Wow, we had a great experience here. Carlos, our server was great. The food was exceptional.  I had the tenderloins and lobster. My wife had the bass.  We also had the potatoes. Everything was as good as they could have been. We also did the generous pour... which was 7 wines all you could drink for 25.  If the appetizers were cheaper, I would have bought more (we just got 1 salad).... If the wine was more expensive,  I would have bought in spite of it."}
{"text":"Wow loved this place !  I celebrated my birthday dinner here and it was amazing .  Everyone in my group was extremely happy.  Not only was the food good, but they truly made my bday special by adding decorations.  All the the workers were nice and service was amazing .  If you want an amaZing steak this is the place to go ..."}
{"text":"Was advised to come here. A little disappointed. Steak wasn't great. I always get a rib-eye cooked med/rare. It came out a little overcooked. For the price and atmosphere I expected much better."}
{"text":"I was here the other night for dinner with some out of town friends.  I started with a Caesar salad and I loved that I could get it with delicious anchovies!  Don't fill up on their bread basket as it's very good.  My bone in ribeye was cooked a perfect medium rare and the roasted brussels sprouts were delicious.  They have a large wine list with good choices in all price ranges.  Our server Andy recommended the Justin Isosceles and it went great with the steak.  This place isn't cheap but they do a great job!"}
{"text":"It's been many years since we've been to The Capital Grille.  My employer used to treat us during the holidays after we worked 12-15 hour days/nights decorating the lobby for Christmas.  It was my first time trying calamari and the Stoli Doli - both sublime.  As was everything else I consumed.  I've been wanting to return since then, but budgetary restraints prohibit.  Hopefully we'll go again someday."}
{"text":"Cap Grille has always been one of my favorite Steak Houses to go to in Las Vegas.  The food is always excellent and the view and atmosphere is second to none.  My last visit introduced me to the best Waiter in Las Vegas, Mr Frankie Storione.  Frankie is the best, not only is he an absolute expert on the menu, but he has to be one of the most entertaining people I have met in a long time.  You have a guest for life Frankie!  Thanks for making a great evening out with my friends even better.  I highly recommend requesting Frankie the next time you dine with Capital Grille."}
{"text":"If you want to step back in time to when ladies were ladies and gents were gents, Capital Grille is the place.  The dark wood and soft lighting of the dining area whisk one away to a time of simpler elegance.  The food at Capital Grille is standard fare--steaks and seafood, known for its dry aged meats.  A Manhattan here tastes like a Manhattan.  The entrees are excellent.  The sides, a little disappointing given how good the entrees are.  I'm a dessert person and often find myself disappointed with the standard desserts at steakhouses, but the chocolate espresso cake with raspberries and whipped cream didn't disappoint.  The creme brulee was caramelized to perfection.  All in all, a quality meal and experience with impeccable service."}
{"text":"Meals expertly planned and delivered!  great tableservice and decent pricing for an upscale Steak house.  Chappellet red fusion vino was a perfect welcomed compliment to my Sliced Filet with mushrooms and baby onions and my brothers Filet Oscar was cooked medium to perfection.  The lobster crab cake appetizer was delicious ..homemade tartar sauce was a perfect topping. Fresh made mint lemonade and the dimly lit restaurant and all its beauty sealed the deal for a perfect meal.  When in Pittsburgh this place is a Must!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Would visit again.  This is a very fancy steak house and offers an intimate setting for dates or special events. Service was wonderful. They even dressed up our table in advance since we told them we were celebrating a birthday. Our steaks were amazing and overall the meal was excellent. I would visit this restaurant again."}
{"text":"The ambiance is deliciously dark and a throwback to the grand old days of quality tablecloths and real silverware. The service here was very sub-par.  Perhaps that was because I was dressed like an ignorant tourist that just wanted to be comfortable checking out the city---FYI--tourists have money to spend, too... I hate the fact that most upscale steak restaurants ignores the needs of patrons who want to watch their waistline. My husband likes steak, BUT--- I want to eat healthy.  So, how about some healthy options, Capital?   I had to special order my salad and take off a bunch of junk. There entree-sized salad was fit for a mouse that had already eaten...I  left hungry! Ugh. Plus---my special order came out wrong and I had to (once again) watch my husband eat while I fantasized about how many carbs were in the napkin... Oh, I won't be coming back.  There are too many other great places to spend my well-earned money on."}
{"text":"Capital Grille is decent but I am not sure I will be back anytime soon. I was there for a company holiday party recently and although everyone was very nice, something seemed to be just a little off.   We were all ushered into a room where we had a few pre-dinner appetizers and drinks. The tomato bruschetta kept falling apart every time someone tried to pick it up, so needless to say it made quite a mess. The room was a little small for all of us and it got hot pretty fast. Looking back, we probably should have stayed in the bar area because it would have been a little bit more room to move around it.   The dinner choices were decent and I must say that the calamari was one of my favorite apps. The green salad was really good, along with the lobster mac and cheese, the brussel sprouts and the mash potatoes. I was very disappointed in my filet mignon because although it came out cooked perfectly, it tasted as it someone had dipped it in salt and seared it and then dipped it back in salt again. Yes that salty. I ate one bite and wanted to spit it out but I managed to down it along with a huge glass of water. I didn't ask for another steak as I probably should but I didn't see our waiter again until they were coming to take our plates. I did eat alot of brussel sprouts that night so it was not all bad.   The flourless chocolate espresso cake was not as good as I thought it was going to be. I had one bite and shoved that to the side because it was just eh. I was very happy that I had also ordered the creme brulee for our \"guest\" that never showed because that was delicious.   All in all it was just ok. Like I said, I am not sure I will be back anytime soon but we will see.   Special note: Shouts out to Christian for the great wine recommendations, Jose and Damian. There was another young lady that also took care of us but alas I never got her name."}
{"text":"I made a reservation here as part of the magical dining month and it was one of the best decisions I have made.  I made the reservation for 6:45 however I forgot the time and turned it at 7:00 and they happily seated us which was a nice bonus. Parking was bit of a hassle but after that everything worked out.  I had the salad for starter and it was perfectly dressed and seasoned and my partner ordered the soup which was really good too. They provide a great selection of breads too that went down a treat.  They have a huge winelist which made it somewhat difficult to decide on what wine to get. There is a strong focus on american wines.  For entree I ordered the dry aged porterhouse steak - 24 oz and my partner got the seared sirloin & butter poached lobster., both were cooked perfectly and surprisingly tasty for the price, combine with the lobster mac and cheese and creamed spinach were a great addition to the steak.  We got the desserts which were chef's seasonal fruit sorbet a nice, light ending to any meal..  They bill came to about 200 including two glasses of wine and tip.  Overall this a great restaurant and I would certainly recommend it to people whatever the occasion, be it a birthday party to a business dinner."}
{"text":"After being treated to a few Yelp events here we finally came on our own to celebrate a special occasion. I find it surprising that this place is owned by the same company that does Olive Garden and Red Lobster, but that isn't the fault of Capital Grille. Overall, it was fantastic for a special meal, and we'll probably be here again. The service was exactly what you'd expect at this caliber of restaurant. Prompt, helpful, and just a little over the top. I liked the drink menu on the iPad with photos of each drink. The steak we ordered was cooked perfectly and exactly how we wanted it. The calamari was interesting, as I've never had or even fathomed it with peppers. I worked around those and the squid itself was good, and DH enjoyed the peppers. We had the mac and cheese and enjoyed that as well. DH liked the Stolli, their signature martini and mine was good as well."}
{"text":"Been to many restaurants in the Phoenix area but very few come close to the service and excellent food as this establishment. We took my sister in law and her husband for her 50th Bday there on Friday night.  Nelson our waiter was outstanding. This comes from a man who's been in and around the restaurant business for over 20 years. From the minute we walked in the place felt friendly.  I can't wait to return.  Well done"}
{"text":"Nice late-dinner last night after the Laugh for a Cure. Since it was late (almost ten) we opted for an entree only and no other accompaniments. I went with the Scallops and Mushroom Risotto and my friend had the Chilean Sea Bass. The Scallops were really good - and with five on the plate it was the perfect size entree. Some of the best scallops I have ever had.  The Sea Bass was interesting, as it was served in a beef based mushroom consumme broth.That was a little different and would have been better in a bed of something else (like the risotto or maybe some spinach).   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It has such a nice, relaxing ambience. Every time I have come here I always just eat at the bar. The bartenders are very kind and have excellent service. They immediately attend to you and they help answer your questions and give your good recommendations. They also check on you quite often which I love. They really want to make your experience awesome and it always is! I love their food! I like how they have healthy options too like their salmon salad which is so delicious! Get it! :)  It is a little pricey, but I think for the type of restaurant, the food is reasonably priced and it is so good! Their bathroom is really nice too! Super clean and is very nice! It has a really nice view of the strip with big windows with lots of natural light. Can't wait to come here at night for a date!! :)"}
{"text":"Amazing service. Great food. Great wine. San Pellegrino and awesome desserts. A great way to spend Mothers Day or any other special occasion. Thank you for making our first weekend as homeowners in Arizona memorable."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Service was great.  It was a group of 7 of us...I had the filet mignon, my husband had the porter.  The lobster mac and cheese was a good choice for our daughter.  The other guests all had steaks as well.  It was cooked to their desires.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent taste wise. The atmosphere and staff is amazing. My only complaint is that I only got 2 little baby pieces of lobster in my Mac and cheese, the flavor was great but I didn't think it was worth the money for the amount of lobster you got in it. My boyfriend got the clam chowder (said he's had better before) he also got the citrus salmon, VERY tasty! All in all I'd recommend this place for someone who is looking for a place to spend a anniversary or birthday dinner."}
{"text":"This place never fails me! Every dish has always been A-MA-ZING! The restaurant is beautiful and very elegant. The tables by the windows have a gorgeous view of the strip. The service is always impeccable and the staff are polite, helpful and are always making sure your meal and your whole experience is perfect. I highly recommend the Lobster Mac and Cheese, the Calamari and the Sushi-Grade Sesame Seared Tuna with Ginger Rice."}
{"text":"We had just rolled into Vegas, were staying right next to the Captial Grille (in the Trump) and wanted to get something to eat.  I called and got reservations for an hour later.  It worked out perfectly!  We wandered in, were met by some very friendly staff and grabbed a bottle of wine in the bar while we waited about 10 minutes for our table.    When we sat at our table, the view was amazing!  We got a table with a view of the strip.  It was so great!  With only an hour notice!  I was a HUGE fan of that!  There must have been some mix-up because we sat for about 10 minutes waiting for our waitress to come by.  But, there was this delightful warm bread almost the moment we were seated and that was all I really needed.    The food: I ordered the proscuitto wrapped mozzarella to start.  It was served warm and the mozzarella seemed to take some of the saltiness out of the dish.  I really liked it.  Hubby had crab cakes to start.  For the main, I had the tenderloin and lobster.  It was really flavorful but the lobster didn't really seem necessary.  hubby got the crab stuff shrimp which was also VERY good.  The tartar sauce we SUPER yummy!   For the side, we got the brussel sprouts which tasted overly smokey.  I wouldn't get them again.  Sure it was pricey, but it was smoke-free, quiet and clean.  Beats the noise of a casino in my book."}
{"text":"To say that my experience was flawless would be an understatement. From the service to the presentation of the food, everything was spectacular.  My group and I had the opportunity to sample many dishes and my favorites include lobster salad with citrus vinaigrette, bruschetta with house-made mozzarella, and the sliced filet. Honestly, despite of the fancy foods sampled, the rich, butter laden mashed potatoes were the most memorable. Seriously, do yourself a favor and try those potatoes!"}
{"text":"Great location with views of the Strip and Wynn's landscaping.  I didn't quite get that part of previous reviews until I saw it in person.  Very rich decor and typical high end steak house ambiance.  They have a massive wine list (which I didn't sample but my group was very impressed with).  There are enough choices of seafood and meats to satisfy anyone.   Caprese appetizer was an interesting twist on the typical format, and very good.  You order sides for the table and they only cover about 2-3 people so you might need more, which increases the cost for a larger group.  But all we had was really well done and service was great."}
{"text":"Echoing a few other reviewers, capital grille is a five star place that should really be more a three star. The food is nothing special for how much you pay for it. My friend and I came for dinner to catch up while he was in town, we were quickly seated at an open table in the bar area which was nice. Our waitress was kind of aloof at times, she'd be very attentive for a short period of time and then nowhere to be found for a long period of time in between. We shared a few starters that were all unremarkable, i will say their bread basket definitely didn't disappoint. I had the sliced filet with mushrooms and a fig sauce, my filet was ordered to be medium rare plus, and it came out barely medium rare. The middle pink wasn't even warm. The dish was definitely way more on the sweeter side than I anticipated. My friends meat was cooked to correct temperature though. Our sides again were nothing to write home about. The cheesecake was tasty, and I got a cappuccino that had had about 2-3 inches of foam on it that I had to scoop out to get to the barely lukewarm espresso. All in all, I feel like capital grille is becoming the Olive Garden of fine dining steakhouses, the quality seems to be going down as they are trying to maybe appeal to a wider base of customers? Not really sure, but there are def so many other legit steakhouse options in Charlotte that are better quality and worth the $$$$$$"}
{"text":"STOLI DOLI. That's the number one reason to stop by the Capital Grille in Fashion Show Mall. Stoli vodka infused with pineapple. It's a simple drink with not a lot of bite, but don't be fooled into thinking it's not potent. The concoction is allowed to sit for over a week in a large glass jar, which makes the vodka taste sweet and smooth. And it goes down easy, maybe a little too easy.  After hanging out at the bar for a bit our party of four got a table in the dining room. While not my top choice of steakhouses in Las Vegas, The Capital Grille is still a good, dependable place to eat. It's a national chain and we've tried other locations before (in DC). It's got an old-fashioned, buttoned-up steakhouse feel. The kind of place that is perfect for the power lunch crowd.  As for the food, most of what we had was very good. The calamari was excellent and crispy. The lobster and crabcakes had large chunks of both crab and lobster with not much filler. The lobster bisque was a little on the bland side. The chopped salad was by far the worse thing we ate. I could pick leaves and weeds from my back yard, toss them in a dish and it would taste similar to their salad. All the steaks (delmonico, filet, and filet oscar) we had were perfectly cooked and seasoned and very tender. For desert we had the chocolate hazelnut cake, obnoxiously big and large enough for four people to share, it was deliciously chocolatey, sweet and moist.  Our waiter did a solid job the whole night, except when the check arrived. He accidentally rung up another tables order on ours. So our bill was over $100 more than expected. For a restaurant of this caliber and a staff that is this well trained that type of error should never happen. But our waiter was quick to correct it and apologized profusely. Not the best way to end dinner, but it still didn't take away from the fact that the food is very good, although very traditional and conservative."}
{"text":"For a change, I was the guest and not the one picking up tab. I'll have to try that more often. The sales rep from a film production supply house smoothly lied and said Channel 70 Productions was his favorite customers (I am a real pain because I demand perfect service and a high level of competence from my vendors) and offered to buy dinner and I accepted since his offer included the Capital Grille. Right away I noticed people actually dressed for dinner. I like that and it gave me a chance to wear the Countess Mara tie my wife had given me the previous week. Yeah, I know it's name dropping, but both my wife and the tie deserve the credit. I'm one of the few men on the planet who enjoys receiving ties as gifts. The tables were too close together for my liking and it was easy to overhear the conversations of others. Perhaps they were just talking loudly.  I ordered the Delmonico with no seasonings. I always order steaks minus seasoning. If a steak needs that kind of help, then the steak isn't much to begin with. The steak was great. One of the best steaks I've had in awhile. Service was movie perfect. If your wallet can stand the heat, dine at the Capital Grille on your next trip to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Capital Grille isn't my favorite steakhouse (although it's up there) and it definitely isn't one of the places that comes to mind when I think of hanging out at the bar and watching the game. But that's what I was forced to do this week when the lady had to attend a dinner seminar being held in one of their back rooms. I sat at the bar for the next two hours and had a great time.  For starters, the after-work vibe in there was pretty cool. The restaurant is fairly busy (read: noisy) but not so much that you couldn't carry a conversation at the bar in normal tones. And my bartender (not sure if her name was Alex or Alice) was on her A-game. The whiskey & gingers hit the spot and so did the lamb chops and potatoes au gratin. ll came out pretty quickly. And shout-out to the bread...oh the bread. Good stuff all around. I'll be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited this place while we were in Vegas because he loved the one in Chicago. We went in with high hopes, but we were disappointed. We had cocktail shrimp, lobster crab cake, french onion soup, the halibut special, ahi tuna, and the chocolate cake. Everything tasted bland and dry except for the soup (way too salty though)...  We loved the atmosphere, the friendly waiter (who came and refilled our lemonade and ice tea free of charge 5 times!!), and the big portion of food. But, we probably won't come back since the food is not that great... =("}
{"text":"I botched the reservation.  It was my wife's birthday dinner and I botched it, reserving a place the evening before and not realizing it until we arrived the following night and they didn't have us on the list.  It was a one hour wait to get seated.  The woman at the front of the house told us we could sit at the bar if we wanted to get in faster, and my wife, disappointed, lamented that she didn't want to spend her birthday dinner experience at a barstool.  And...they fit us in.  Like...within five minutes.  Straight across the board the wait staff was top notch, and added special little touches to make it a nice night for my wife.  Loved the wagyu beef carpaccio appetizer.   Really enjoyed the lobster bisque Was a little disappointed in the \"special\" (more in a minute) Thoroughly enjoyed the birthday dessert they brought my wife gratis.  What was going to make this a three star review (but I thought better of it) was the entree special, which was a NY strip with a Gorgonzola cheese sauce with a red wine reduction.  The reduction was sweet.  TOO sweet for me.  I didn't like how it paired with the cheese sauce OR the steak.  The steak was cooked just right, but was a little tough, and I had to cut a couple inedible pieces off.  I'm not sure whether to chalk that up to not awesome steak, or just my lack of experience with Strip steak vs. Filet.  When i looked back over the evening, the only thing they didn't nail was the sauce on the steak (and arguably the meat, but really...come on) and although it's a place that is KNOWN for its steak, I think a 4 start rating is deserved."}
{"text":"We have Ben coming here for over 5 years and ever time it has ben perfect (if not they make perfect) so if your looking for the best of the best in Pittsburgh look no further than the Capital Grill!!! Tip Kona crusted filet is my favorite"}
{"text":"A wonderful Anniversary lunch for our Aunt and Uncle at Legacy Village , Cleveland , Ohio.   From the moment we walked in a most welcoming staff greeted us ... We were promptly seated .  The charming waitress was  most attentive.  The menu for lunch offered many interesting choices. Everyone enjoyed their selection .  The food was wonderfully prepared and presented beautifully.  The service was excellent and our waitress most personable. The complementary dessert was a flourless chocolate cake and cheesecake  on a lovely tray.  It was a memorable lunch , as my Aunt and Uncle recalled,   \"Restaurants,  as  we remembered\"."}
{"text":"Oh my yum. Delicious steak and sides, amazing wait staff. First class all the way! Bentley, our server was wonderful. Very knowledgeable and attentive....and an amazing wedding ring.....we were here for our anniversary dinner a couple months ago and will return for special occasion dinners! So good!"}
{"text":"My wife  and I enjoyed our 44th wedding anniversary here and we had a fantastic meal.  I had the kona encrusted sirloin and my wife had the salmon with lobster mac and cheese as our  side.  Spinach salad with warm bacon dressing and clam chowder were our appetizers.  Our waiter Brandon Carter provided spectacular service levels and we  were blown away by the anniversary treats provided (special card, red stars and rose pedals and champagne and desert).  It was a memorable evening.  One that we will never forget. The entrees and everything were prepared just right. We can't wait to our next visit to the Capital Grille somewhere in the USA."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place tonight for my wife's birthday. We've talked ourselves out of it in past because we were afraid it'd be too stuffy for us. We aren't fancy, but do enjoy fancy food! It was not stuffy at all. We love steak and have never found a steakhouse as good as what we can grill on our Big Green Egg...that is until tonight. To start, our table was decorated with confetti, rose pedals and a birthday card for my wife (they asked the occasion during the reservation process). Our server, Eric, was perfect; very friendly, prompt and knowledgeable. We never had an empty glass or dirty silverware sitting around. We were given 4 different types of bread when we were seated so we skipped the appetizer. I ordered the 24oz bone-in ribeye. Perfection!! Very flavorful and juicy. Cooked perfectly throughout the steak. My wife got the grilled salmon and enjoyed every bite. We shared half orders of Brussel sprouts, asparagus and scalloped potatoes. All delicious. Sides are ala carte, but big enough portions for the table. We got half orders and had left overs. They brought a free birthday dessert. The cheesecake was our favorite. Very pricey, but worth it on special occasions. We spent $150 with no appetizers or alcoholic drinks (just tea and water)."}
{"text":"I visit this Capital Grille location several times a year... usually for some kind of work meeting or special occasion.  While my visits can cost a pretty penny, I've never been disappointed.  Most recently I was at TCG for a Master Wine Tasting event, which was a great deal... and it's a promotion that is taking place at dinner time now through our crazy Summer (ending September 5th).  For $25 per person, TCG offers generous pours of up to 11 wine selections.  We sampled quite a variety of vino: sparkling, red, and white, from Napa Valley, Italy, and New Zealand.  I'm no wine connoisseur, but I enjoyed them all!   And for $40 more, ($65 total), TCG does a food pairing to go with the wine selections. On the night we were there, our courses included Lobster and Crab Cake, Pan-Fried Calamari, Cedar Planked Salmon, Lamb Chop, Sirloin, and Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake.  Not the healthiest meal, but it sure was a foodie experience!  My favorites were the calamari and the flourless chocolate cake.  The rest of the group I dined with enjoyed it all as well... You cannot go wrong with escaping the heat this summer and spending an evening at The Capital Grille with their special tasting menus!"}
{"text":"Ok so to be honest there was nothing wrong with the experience I just wasn't really impressed by anything. We came here for our anniversary a few nights ago and wanted to try one of the nicer restaurants that we hadn't been to yet. Upon walking in we were greeted by the hostess who asked us our reso time and were told that they were getting our table ready and would be seated shortly. We walked over to the bar to grab some drinks while we waited the bar staff was friendly and took our order right away. Moments later we were guided to our table which had tiny hearts all over it which was a cute touch for our anniversary. The service was ok a bit slow and our server seemed extremely tired but nice. He suggested some features and took our order, I got the filet with mashed potatoes and the mozzarella and tomato salad and my guy got the salmon with green beans and creamed spinach.   The salad was alright the best part being the mozzarella which was light and delicate and very very fresh. The main courses came and my steak was just sort of alright. It lacked flavor but was cooked correctly it just sort of tasted like they cooked the steak and that's it no salt pepper or seasoning of any kind it seemed not really at all what I expected based on the reviews for this place. The mashed potatoes were pretty good almost too creamy though for lack of a better way to describe them I guess. My guys salmon tasted pretty good but nothing out of this world either and the creamed spinach had an odd flavor that I just can't put my finger on but my guy said he liked them so that made me happy. Overall for the price we paid for the food $186 before tip it just wasn't worth it in my eyes and there's really nothing more that I love to drop money on other than good food on a night out but this just won't be one of the places we come back to. Makes me sad I had been meaning to come to this place for years we just always went to Ruth's Chris when we had a date night since it's our favorite but decided to break from tradition this time.   The service like I said he just seemed completely exhausted so not gonna really hold it against him they were busy and I can understand as he did his best and took our picture for our anniversary which was great. They have complimentary valet out front which I would recommend but free spots on the street on weekends and nights but good luck finding one.   Overall personally if your gonna spend upwards of 200 on two entrees and a couple drinks with a salad and some sides or even more if you have more people I think there's better options but to each their own."}
{"text":"I don't think Capital Grille is all that...  For the prices, you expect the BEST service, quality, atmosphere, etc.  And the handful of meals I've had at Capital Grille have been fine, but not worth the $$.  Most recently, 4 of us went to celebrate our friend Jack's birthday.  I was impressed to see that they had graffiti on the table and a card for the birthday boy, but I was less impressed with the rest of the meal.  We did enjoy our appetizers (calamari, prosciutto wrapped mozzarella, lobster mac n cheese, fresh oysters on the half shell, and a Caesar salad).  The oysters were actually the highlight of my meal.  I should've just had those with a glass of the Sauv Blanc and called it a day... but instead, we ordered more food!  Each couple split a sirloin (none of us loved it even though the menu describes it saying \"You won't find a more flavorful steak.\")  We also had a side of corn and a side of mushrooms... I guess we did have a lot of food!  On top of that, the birthday boy chose 2 desserts for the table: the strawberry cheesecake and the keylime pie.  We didn't even make a dent in either as they were nothing to write home about... and the waiter brought a candle out after the fact.  So, $300 later, we walked out the door saying how much fun we had with our friends but that Capital Grille, sadly, is quite overrated.  At least the dogs will have some leftover steak for the next few days, but I won't rush back to Capital Grille anytime soon, especially if I have to pay!"}
{"text":"It felt like we took a step into the world of mad men. Beautiful wood walls with classic portraits, including one of Berry Goldwater. The service is classic. Our server Ken was fun, witty and charming. The staff is extremely friendly and treated my mother and I very well. I cannot emphasize the quality of service here. This is fine dining at its best. The food is wonderful and tasteful. If you have the pleasure request ken as your server and you will understand high quality service, as my mother calls it \"old fashion service\""}
{"text":"We went on Labor Day: it was one of few steakhouses opened and my father in law suggested it since he had been to one on the east coast.  Service was fantastic, our server John said he was the newbie at the restaurant but clearly he was not new to servicing.  I had a very good dirty martini but next time I'll get it a little dirtier. My Fil had Kiltlifter beer and when there was only 1 left they asked him if they should keep it cold for him (he said yes!). That is great service.  Appetizers: Oysters on the 1/2 shelf...delicious. And perfectly crispy Pan Fried Calamari...also delicious.  We all had the 22 oz Delmonico bone-in Ribeye., medium rare, closer to rare than medium and they were perfectly cooked! Also ordered 2 sides: the lobster mac & cheese...super cheesy with large pieces of lobster. And fresh creamed spinach in a béchamel sauce. If that wasn't enough our waiter gave us mashed potatoes because as he said \" you have to try these\".   We are still full from the experience but will be back!"}
{"text":"Worst steak ever. Kona dry aged steak was awful. Ordered med rare and got med to med well. They said it was lighting and tried using a spot light to convince me otherwise. It was chewy as leather and there were tendons that were not melted in high enough heat. Go to grand lux instead for their ribeye or the food court next door."}
{"text":"Outstanding service.  Reservation was simple and on line.  Food was awesome and was paced well.  I.E. apps and then entree.  Ruben was awesome and made us feel welcome and important."}
{"text":"Amazing lunch with awesome service.  House made grapefruit soda was very refreshing.  Portions were more than enough for lunch.  Ordered dessert to go, server made us a nice ice box so the treats did not melt. - Nice touch  Offers valet parking."}
{"text":"Awesome place!  Do not leave without trying their house drink, the Stoli Doli!  It will knock your socks off!  Great atmospheres, neighborhood bar feel to it.  Staff is awesome."}
{"text":"Good gluten free restaurant choice! Our party of three dined here Monday evening.  We opted to sit outside as the dining room seemed very loud and we didn't want to struggle to have a conversation.  Our waitress was knowledgeable about the gluten free options. We started with the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella. The \"croutons\" (rather large flat pieces of toast) were served on a separate plate for the guys to enjoy. My husband and his coworker ordered the bone in filet while I opted for the ny strip.  We all ordered our steaks medium.  We received rare, medium rare and medium well.  Definitely a downer for a steak house, but not a deal breaker.  Our sides were the au gratin potatoes (minus the topping to keep it GF), asparagus with lemon mosto and the roasted brussel sprouts.  The potatoes were awesome but those watching their salt intake would want to avoid this one. For dessert, the guys opted for the molten chocolate cake and I ordered the flourless chocolate \"cake\".  The guys LOVED their dessert. My dessert DEFINITELY did not disaapoint! It was nice to have a different GF option to try.  Our overall GF experience was great.  Service was slow at times, but friendly. I would definitely eat here again and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good gluten free dining experience."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. What can you say. We had the double thick lamb chops and they were amazing. It was to die for !!  We also had the Cauliflower side. It was BAD !  All salt and obviously no chef ever tasted it. Hence the 4 stars VS - 5. Enjoy !"}
{"text":"Great steak as always, not impressed with first impression at the front desk I will come back though for a good steak and great seafood  Service is efficient and timely"}
{"text":"Best steakhouse in town, celebrated a birthday there tonight. We started with the calamari then had the bone in rib eye & NY strip both were cooked perfectly. Lobster Mac & cheese was rich and flavorful.  Service was flawless from begging to end.  Don't think about it just GO, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We made the trek downtown to the Capital Grille for my mother-in-law's birthday in Jan 2013. We're not regulars to this classy (i.e. expensive) of an establishment so I only have a few other like-restaurants to compare our experience to.   Overall, the experience was quite nice. We ended up here during Restaurant Week which gave our wallets a break. Our server was prompt and attentive even knowing our bill would be much less than the normal 3-top.   I ordered clam chowder, a filet with grilled shrimp, and a cheesecake desert. The soup was delicious and my boyfriend tells me the cheesecake with fresh fruit was also great. (I was too full to eat it and had it boxed up to take home. They boxed it up very nicely for me, but since I was flying out of town for work the next day, he ate it!)   My steak, ordered medium rare, came out a bit more rare than I would have expected (cool red center instead of warm red) but it was tender and delicious none-the-less. The grilled shrimp was overcooked but I wasn't annoyed enough to complain at the time.   Now, I wont be back anytime soon, but that's more a factor of the price than anything else. It's definitely a special occasion kind of place for me, and I have a number of other places like that to try first!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at the Capital Grille and it was hopping even at 6:00 pm.There is lots to love about this place. Ambiance--warm and clubby. Service--professional and attentive. Steaks cooked to perfection, sides pretty good and ample for sharing. Prices about average for upscale dining. So, what's not to like? The drink prices, that's what! Hubby and I enjoy a cocktail before dinner but I could not believe I was charged $14 for a well scotch and water. $14 is so over the top. It is completely unreasonable. We will be back because the food is so good but you can bet I won't order a drink!"}
{"text":"By far the best Capital Grille experience from all the cities we've been to. Pittsburgh's Capital Grille provides the highest 5 star steakhouse experience. The food speaks for itself, but the service and atmosphere of the space have made the dozens of times we've eaten there consistently amazing. There is no better steakhouse experience in Pittsburgh, and one of the finest in the country."}
{"text":"What an amazing dinner out! I don't get to eat at places this fancy very often so when I do it's really special. My wife took me here for my birthday and it was one of the best meals I've ever had. I specifically wanted to mention the Delmonico Steak which is a 22 oz bone-in ribeye that's dry aged. This was the most flavorful and delicious steak I've ever eaten. I've had steak here at RuthsChris, Mastros City Hall and also Dominics and this was better than all of them. My wife had the dry-aged sirloin and that was also excellent but not as good as the Delmonico. Their creme brulee and flourless chocolate espresso cake were also out of this world.  The ambiance and decor of this restaurant were so classy and upscale. It was quiet and romantic and I just felt rich the entire night. The waiter treated us like we were royalty and he was always coming by to refill the bread and glasses. That was the best $150-$200 I've spent in a while and it was definitely worth it!!! Definitely go here for a special meal you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We have been here several times but it's been a few years since we had been there because so many new restaurants have opened in Pittsburgh. The food was excellent. The Stoli Doli drink they are known for is delicious. But the service was poor. That's why I have to give 3 stars. There were 3 of us. The bill was $350. I never complain about the cost of great meals and I've eaten in the best restaurants around the world. But when food is this expensive, the service must be in alignment with the cost of the food. We were finished eating for 15 minutes before our waitress appeared. Then when she did appear, we asked for the check so we wouldn't have to wait longer to get the bill.   I think they need to step up their game since Eddie V's is just a few blocks up the street.   The picture is of the steak tartare appetizer."}
{"text":"I've been to multiple Capital Grilles across the country, and this is by far the best.  Why so?  - The service is phenomenal, wait staff do not bat an eye at any requests and offer that congenial mix of Southern formality and hospitality with a genteel and warm-hearted aplomb  - The crowd is the perfect mix of old families spanning generations of aged grandparents, dapper parents, and bow-tie clad children, to buttoned-down business types, and even the more informal polo-clad athletic types  - Food, they present and cook everything perfectly.  The menu is slightly seasonal, which is surprising, and the seafood is the best in this landlocked area  - Very good overall ambiance, it has the dark wood and oil paintings that are part and parcel to CGs, however, the room is relatively well lit and there is an outdoor seating area and open kitchen which reflects a more modern vibe"}
{"text":"We ate there on a Saturday night, the place was jammed !! I've been to the one in Chicago many times, it's my favorite steak restaurant.  So, after a horrible experience the night before (see my other Las Vegas review), we decided to go to a place that we knew we could depend on.  Capital Grille Las Vegas is right across the street from The Wynn Hotel, so it was very convenient.  The seven  200lb men were very hungry after the bad meal we had the night before, and we weren't disappointed !     The bread and the appetizers were awesome as usual.   The spicy calamari is awesome.  Every place makes calamari, but there's is sautéed with peppers and it puts a new twist to the dish.  Also, the crab cakes were phenomenal.  The steaks were all made to perfection.  They know how to make a steak !  If you ask for it well done, they don't roll their  eyes and tell you that you're ruining it, or that the chef is going to be mad at you.  Good restaurants know how to make a well done steak tender AND juicy.   I had the  Porcini Rubbed Delmonico with 12-Year Aged Balsamic, medium well done.  It was one of the best steaks I ever had.  It was huge, I couldn't even finish the whole thing.  My friends at the table we're fighting for the scraps.  Our waiter and his staff were awesome.   It's hard to keep seven big guys happy,  but somehow they catered to all of our needs.  All in all, it was a great meal and I can still say I've never had a bad meal or a complaint at any Capital Grille."}
{"text":"10000000 stars but service, food is decent & overly priced. Would recommend the food in different states. The Pittsburgh location doesn't meet expectations."}
{"text":"Pretty Restaurant with a great night view of Las Vegas. Waiters provided very professional service and attention throughout the dinner. Their filet mignon was phenomenal served with a special white creamy sauce."}
{"text":"Relaxing atmosphere.  The bone-in ribeye steak was delicious!  Truffle French fries - are you kidding!?!  Awesome.  Fast service, too."}
{"text":"Capital Grill was very nice and cozy inside. It has a very relaxing vibe which I enjoyed immensely. I ordered the filet and it was cooked to perfection. I did however think the side dish of mashed potatoes and green beans were skimpy and flavorless. I ordered crème brulee that was good. All in all I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I had the scallops with risotto and it was amazing. The scallops had just the right amount of crispiness where they were pan fried. Considerable portion size. The decor is cool with lots of bronze animals and a bison mounted on the wall."}
{"text":"Capital Grille was good, I mean it's Capital Grille. The services was excellent and our waiter Terry was amazing.  The wedge salad with chucky pieces bacon.    Anything paired with wine taste amazing.  The t-bone steak was done perfectly.    Try Capital Grille at least once... You wouldn't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I am glad that we made a reservation during lunch for Restaurant Week, because it certainly seemed very busy when we walked in. Most likely they were catering to the usual customer base of downtown employees in addition to those like us. The interior itself felt like a museum with all the paintings on the walls and the stuffed animal heads (the latter was probably not necessary). One annoying thing was the slow speed at which we were attended to--we had to wait quite a bit before getting our waters, before getting our orders taken, the bread coming out, and then finally each of the fixed courses.   The bread and clam chowder first course were fine--pretty tasty, nothing to write home about. The second course got interesting. We each ordered a dry aged sirloin, which came with a good salad on the side. The steak was actually done wonderfully, super tender and finely spiced around. But the problem was that both of ours came out rare when we ordered medium-rare! Even our waiter acknowledged this, although by the time he came back around we waited so long that we were pretty much finished with our meal. It wasn't the biggest problem in the world, but our waiter acknowledged the mixup and compensated our meal. So that was nice, and the desserts were good too. So while I probably wouldn't go back on a normal occasion, it sure was an interesting experience."}
{"text":"The lunch plates are a great deal for a great lunch.  There was enough food for the hubby and I to split it, but I stuffed myself and ate it all by myself!  I had the pepper soup (rich and yummy) the burger with an egg and onions (soooo juicy, perfect and yummy) and the truffle fries (freakin GREAT!! :) Hubby had the steak with green beans (not a lunch plate special) and it was good, the char taste over powered the steak and it was even rare, but it was still ok.  He ate the whole thing :)... Our waiter was awesome, Ricky, he was the best! We also split the coconut cream pie, and it was so good.  I have had their flour-less chocolate cake before and it is crave-able.  It works out to be an affordable and amazing lunch spot, we will be back when we are in the area!"}
{"text":"12/30/17 Very sad to have to give this restaurant only 3 stars when most of the time I want to give them 10 stars We shared the calamari which in the past was excellent  last night it was real bad the waiter did take it off the check but I would have gladly paid for it if was good I know at holiday time restaurants are very busy and staff gets worn out but this is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte and was disappointed  I will go back because of the 6or 7 great meals I've had here they.  Deserve another chance     8/17/17 Another Great meal and service !!! Rates 10 stars!!' Peter Karas and Ashley are super !!' Asked the for a cupcake with a candle for my companions Birthday  As we walked in everyone wished her a Happy Birthday  Table was decorated for a birthday girl and they even left a card happy birthday from the Capital Grill and they gave us a complimentary dessert which was delicious this is one of the best restaurants best well  manage staff that I've been to in a long long time will go back as often as possible    This  is by far one of the best restaurants in Charlotte 5/23/17 Another 5 stars but they should get 10 stars  Paige our waitress was very professional and was only working at this restaurant for 2 weeks Gave us a very very good selection of wine Read off the menu as if she had  been there for years  Knew when to let us talk but always seemed to be right at our table when we needed service Suggest a great Cheesecake dessert  And showed me a new program to get restaurant  rewards which I signed up for  Can't wait to go back    10/21/16 If I could I would give this restaurant 10 stars  Had dinner here again with my daughter and son-law  One of the best restaurants in Charlotte  Bone in 16oz filet and 2 pound lobster Were GREAT As well was our waitress Jennifer Habsbro Very very good at everything she does and extremely professional Will go back as often as I can It was my Daughter and Son - In Laws first time and  they can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and portions are generous.  It is also rather expensive and formal atmosphere  for my liking.  I enjoyed an Oscar style bone in ribeye.  Although delicious, this steak was slightly under my desired medium, and the amount of béarnaise sauce was excessive, yielding the color to an odd pink after slicing several bites.  This is not a new recipe nor innovative, I would expect it to be perfect at this level of dining.  The server did offer an excellent wine pairing, Emmolo Merlot, 2015 from Napa Valley, was the high point of the evening.  Also very nice lobster bisque!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the negatives. In reality there are none. You pay for what you get in this world and this definitely applies to Capital Grille. For my wife and I (neither of which drink alcohol) we spent $200 with tip. It was a special occasion, so I'm not complaining, but the cost can certainly be a limitation. Now for the positives, which are countless. The food is unmatched, the service is stellar, the place is absolutely spotless, classy, and not at all intimidating. I've only been once, but I can guarantee everything on the menu will send the average mortal into a fourth dimension. An absolute must try...even if it means a second mortgage. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"My wife and I have visited The Capital Grill restaurant in both Austin and Houston and had a fantastic experience in both.  The Phoenix location - NOT EVEN CLOSE.  The atmosphere was very rushed from start to finish, the food was OK at best and every time our waitress Shay came by I felt like we were eating at Mel's Diner. We will not be back!"}
{"text":"We usually enjoy this restaurant, but this time it was not up to par. Bread was stale that was brought to table, lettuce wasnt fresh in salad and we shared the lobster mac n cheese, it was ok but could of had more lobster. Creame brulee was was thoroughly enjoyed by husband by then I gave up"}
{"text":"CLASSY.  strangely located for such a fine dining restaurant (in the mall).  But who gives a damn. this place is amazing. had the pleasure of taking the gf here when visiting a friend in vegas who knew all the best things to order.  MUST TRY:  drink - pineapple vodka! sweet & smooth. they bring out the shot in a tiny little fluted glass. talk about a classy shot.   sides - cream of corn. i absolutely love CORN. but anything creamed sounds disgusting. THIS WAS THE BEST FUCKING CORN SIDE I'VE EVER HAD. i could eat this all day. i could have this as an entree. its seasonal. so get it while you can.  entree - i had the chicken. i know, why have chicken at a steakhouse. i regret it as well. def. must go back.   service was superb."}
{"text":"Easily the worst #CapitalGrille, go across the street to #Wynn  Food was terrible  I've never had a worse mozzarella, it was dry, tasteless, and rubbery.  The cherry tomatoes were decent, but beefs takes were hard, tasteless, seemed almost frozen.  Shrimp cocktail was nasty.  Shrimp was gritty, yellow, with black dots   Now in the past, I've loved Capital Grill in Houston, Washington DC., were my favorite.  Go to across the street to The Wynn their food and service is far better."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here my waiter Jason was fun and friendly and the food was amazing"}
{"text":"Recently enjoyed a great meal  while celebrating our wedding anniversary. The staff made our experience so memorable complete with photograph  of the happy occasion. The welcoming taste of hors d'oeuvres was  just right. Our entrees  cooked to an excellent temperature.  And the sampler plate of desserts with happy anniversary was such a nice touch."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Great view. Excellent service.  Any guest that I have ever taken to the Capital Grille has absolutely loved it. Don't let the name mislead you, it is a fine dining establishment that rivals any steakhouse in town. If you are visiting Las Vegas it will be a dining experience you will remember."}
{"text":"New to Scottsdale we were excited to try Capital Grille since we always dined at the one in Palm Beach Gardens. We met friends there & we were so disappointed with the food. The restaurant is beautiful & the service was impeccable ( besides giving the wrong left over bags to each couple ). No biggie we straightened that out quickly.  I don't know if it was restaurant week why the food was inferior but we won't be back. Three of us had filets & they truly were bland & flavorless.& chewy. The fourth person had a bone in strip which he ordered Med & it came rare. Yes he should have sent it back but did not. The wedge salad was a 5 compared to Maestro & Eddies .  Just a wedge with flavorless dressing poured on it. The mashed potatoes were average as well as the green beans. The bread was delicious as well as the deserts. Needless to say we will not be back when there are so many better restaurants in the area. We were SOOO disappointed at the inferior quality of the food. The leftovers were inedible which was no surprise. At these prices we would expect far better.   Amazingly enough we went to Wildfish last week & the bartender said they have the best filets. I always get crab cakes there but tried the filet & scalloped potatoes. They were an A+ , better than Flemings & no comparison to the poor taste & quality of the filets we had last night.   Even with restaurant week each couple spent $200 with wine & I hardly ate anything. What a disappointment!!!"}
{"text":"When I was in high school, I took a girlfriend to dinner here before we both left for college. I had never had a steak as amazing as the filet mignon I enjoyed that night, and from then on, I was hooked.   Yes, Capital Grille is a chain, but it's my favorite of the big steakhouses in Charlotte.   The service is always impeccable. On my last visit, I ate solo at the bar. Filet, a half order of roasted fingerling potatoes, a couple bourbons. Alex, the bartender, makes a mean Old Fashioned.   Expect to have an expensive dinner, but also expect to want to come back for another steak as soon as possible."}
{"text":"The service is always spot on.  The prosciutto wrapped mozzarella was very good.  I was surprised it was served warm, but wouldn't change that.  Main course was gorgonzola crusted NY strip.  The steak was very good, but the gorgonzola was not crusted.  It was basically a slice of cheese laid across the steak and melted.  I scrapped most of it off.  But the au gratin potatoes were superb. If you go there for a drink, the potatoes and wrapped mozzarella will fill you up and make you happy.  Dessert was coconut cream pie.  OMG!  That's all I can say!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were sitting at the bar last Sat just celebrating our anniversary with a cpl drinks ...Alex the bartender had asked my husband while I had stepped away ..how many years?...he replied 50...congratulated us..we continued talking, had another drink and shared appetizers....when we went to pay the check..unbeknownst to us ..they.. Capitol Grille.picked up difference from our card...we were totally blown away by this unexpected generosity. .u should also know the calamari was delightful..light and crispy and the shrimp were phenomenonal.. ..we are very thankful and have shared this story with so many of our friends and famly...looking forward to going back soon and having sea bass /steak...also Greg , the Manager and the other bartender whose name escapes us were so complimentary to ur restaurant.. Thank u very much  again Sincerely Doug and Jean Dustin"}
{"text":"Alex, Gina and Julian did a marvelous job taken care of our table. Food was fantastic we had lamb, surf and turf, couple of different steak varieties, scallops and salmon, not to mention 4 side dishes, everything was great! The Blanton Manhattans were to die for, made with Carpano Antica Sweet Vermouth and Luxardo Cheeries. Definitely one of my favorite, wherever they are located throughout the US"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Sunday night. Lovely old style restaurant with dark wood and demure lighting. Staff were wonderfully attentive but not obsequious. Steak obviously, was great. i also had the lobster bisque. The wine was excellent. Love it."}
{"text":"They have the BEST ribeye steak I've ever had!!   Their desserts are really good too. I tried the flourless espresso cake, creme brûlée, & cheesecake. All were delicious & you can tell the ingredients were high quality!  Their prices obviously aren't cheap, but it's okay to splurge (or get treated) every now & then"}
{"text":"A delicious splurge. Went for restaurant week and I think I'm going to be going back every year for the restaurant week menu. My husband and I both got the kona crusted dry-aged ribeye....my mouth is watering just thinking about it.   Pro's: Superb service Mouth watering steaks and food Attention to detail  Cons: Price - but typical for a gourmet steak house They really lay-on the wine suggestions, even after you decline  If you haven't gone, I think it is one of the BEST places on the list for Restaurant Week. At least go then - it's basically 50% off the normal price. Great time to try it out if you are unsure."}
{"text":"You will be tempted to go with the kona crusted sirloin because it sounds so good (and it is), but decide on the filet instead.  You will thank me later."}
{"text":"My family and I love eating at Capital Grille not only because the food, but the outstanding service we get every time we go there. I have never eaten at restaurant with such great hospitality."}
{"text":"I visit the capital grille quite regularly for lunch and dine at the bar 90 % of the time. \"G\" the bartender is great and the service at the bar is always impeccable.   FOOD- I tend to always get the crab meat cocktail as an app because its delicious. Ive had most of the menu and everything is great. The Burger is top 3 burgers in town and has chopped onion and bacon ( i think ) in it but it just adds to the flavor and you probably couldn't tell it was in there if you didn't know.   SERVICE - great  AMBIENCE- great"}
{"text":"All I wanted in life was a juicy, tender medium rare filet. Capital Grille not only delivered that, but also had lobster bisque as a special. Lobster bisque with at least 2 full claws worth of meat in it. Their bread was delicious too. It's expensive and can be a little formal/stuffy, but their food has been consistently amazing every time I've gone."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for our anniversary last year and it was really nice! The bread they serve was amazing and I remember I had some kind of pasta but that was the best I've tasted. The atmosphere was really pretty being able to see out the window to the strip. A little pricey but you pay for what you like :) will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"The salmon was excellent here.  The portion was generous.  The service was good.  The mashed potatoes were very average.  The complimentary assorted bread was actually one of the highlights of the meal.  This is good addition to legacy village but for this price point I would expect all the elements of the meal to be executed above average but the sides here were a bit uninspired.  This is a good place for celebrating special occasions for the ambiance."}
{"text":"Great meal for 48th wedding Anniversary! Salmon was great! Steak Oscar delious. We had service that was was warm and caring."}
{"text":"This place is a little pricey but for a special occasion this place is great. I love the pineapple martinis and the porcini delmonico. Delicious! I like the ambience too!"}
{"text":"Had a party of 12 and they accommodated us without any issue on a Saturday night.  I'm sure I'd this was in the middle of the strip it would be packed all the time. But if you can deal with getting out to the fashion mall, it is worth it.  Plan for 100$ per person for entrees, bottle of wine and a starter or salad or side to share.  Had the steak and lobster, it was incredible. Filet was great too. We shared a wedge salad and they even split it for us in the kitchen.  Waitress had some bland humor but was very attentive.  Definitely would go again."}
{"text":"First time for dinner at Capital Grill. Very high end restaurant with excellent service. I had a dry rub NY strip and my wife had a Filet. My steak was perfect but my wife's steak came out medium when she asked for medium rare. They corrected the mistake quickly with the Chef coming out personally with the new steak. Overall excellent food and atmosphere. I would have rated a 5 star if it weren't for the steak mishap. We will definitely go again and I highly recommend this fine dining restaurant."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service and wonderful food.  Oysters were fresh and delicious, lobster bisque was tasty and the Cheri pour table-side is nice touch.  Rib eyes were healthy and delicious and berries with cream were fresh and nice variety."}
{"text":"My son who is 8 has a fine palate and while he enjoys kid food like any other kid, he believe it or not, really appreciates a fine dining experience.  So when I received a $50 gift certificate to Capital Grille (thanks to Yelp!) I decided to take him there to celebrate the last days of summer and first day of school.  The truth is, you don't see too many kids at the Capital Grille especially during the lunch hour.  Mainly, you see the business crowd so I was a little concerned with how Andrew would be received.  My worries were for naught. Our waiter, Jose, was fantastic. He had small children of his own and he treated Andrew with such brilliance that as a parent, I was impressed and grateful. He answered every question Andrew had with patience from how is the burger cooked to if extra lemonade is free. He also showed Andrew how to use the scraper to clean off the table. It was so enjoyable we were there for over an hour and a half and Jose never made us feel as though he was wishing the table to be free for the next customers.  I could go on and on about how great Jose is and what a wonderful dining experience we had . . . . I should talk about the food too. We both ordered from their summer pre fixe menu- I had the watermelon and arugula salad and the scallop over risotto. Andrew had their angus burger with fries. Both were large portioned and plenty filling.  And absolutely delicious. Both of us loved our entrees! During the lunch, the manager even came by and said hello to BOTH Andrew and I.  Andrew being 8, could have been totally brushed off by the manager and the waiter- Capital Grille showed itself for the fine establishment that its reputation stands for and treated Andrew with such enthusiasm and respect that I was very appreciative for such a fine dining experience for both of us!"}
{"text":"Let me preface my statements by saying that I love the Denver Capital Grill as much as I hate the Vegas Cap Grille. Since they have been taken over by the Olive Garden people, I did write management, so I'll update the review once I hear back from corporate.  So why no love for the Vegas location?? To begin with, our lousy waiter.  He complained to us the whole time.   Save it buddy.  I'm out in 110 Vegas heat, and want a cool, inviting experience.  Even though we told him we're Denver regulars, he treated us like tourists.  Ignored us for a couple of local women who obviously drink there often. Our service went from bad to horrible after I ordered the $13 glass of wine instead of the $23 glass he recommended.   Up sell someone else.  I know my wines, and will not pay $23 a glass for a $23 a bottle of wine.   ( I know...I know, my $13 a glass is $13 a bottle, but we all have our price points). Bad service aside, my lobster bisque was lukewarm at best; globby and mediocre.  The sherry accompaniment never came, so we had to flag the waiter.  10 minutes later, someone from the kitchen brought it.  By that time, the soup was really cold. The BF's burger was perfect cooked -- medium rare and huge. However the fries were inedible.    The waiter never appeared with the check, so I flagged him down on my way to the rest room, and signed on my way back. Unfortunately, he kept my credit card... I've always said, customer service will either make or break a business, and the way the Capital Grille handled the error is 1 star. The next day I returned for the card ( a $40 round trip cab ride).  The manager who was holding the card was tacky; not in a hurry to return the card, so we sat down for lunch.   Finally he arrived at our table, and had the nerve to suggest I offer a reward. Reward??? How about tearing up the check for the previous day.  Or at least comping up lunch that day.  Your waiter caused us great inconvenience, and for what?  A mediocre lunch, terrible service, and a huge price tag.  I'm hoping that corporate has a better 'tude, since I still want to patronize the Denver location  ps We were \"invited\" back for lunch......AT THE VEGAS LOCATION. Sure, let me jump in my corporate jet and lunch in Vegas. Thanks for nothing. Typical Olive Garden mentality....that's what Darden Corporation is making the Cap Grille.   You have just won my tacky award"}
{"text":"Food: 4 Stars Waiter Service: 6 Stars  Our waiter was Kelly Taylor and by far this was the best service I have ever had. A true professional.  The food was quite wonderful also, I had a Fillet, with his recommended butter shallot sauce with Kona Coffee? I didn't even listen to what he suggested I said yes, and what came out was truly a culinary miracle. It was as juicy as can be and the sauce was simple incredible.  This will be a usual place when I am in town."}
{"text":"OMG very good service well take care of us thank you Elizabeth !! sarvic compliment food !! My friend just married we had fantastic salmon , Seabass, stake,and lobster !! All of them are good."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed at the Capital Grille on any visit that I make. Having the original location in my home city gives me great perspective in understanding how things \"should be\"  I visited the bar for a quick bite and cocktail during my visit and Mark made the time spent there enjoyable. The truffle fries, calamari and fresh bread were perfect as usual. Next time I am ordering dinner.."}
{"text":"The best steakhouse of all the chains, for sure. Expensive but worth it for special occasions and company functions. Steaks are amazing. Lobster Mac 'n Cheese is the best I've ever had in any restaurant. Bread was fresh and delicious. Au gratin potatoes and all the veg dishes are full of flavor. Staff are ready to meet your needs. It is not a five because we were disappointed in the seafood/lobster."}
{"text":"Here on business so picked the capital grill. Good location across from the Wynn. Can walk right across the street in 10 minutes. Had a table overlooking the north end of the strip. Service was outstanding (Peter was my guy). Great recommendations on every course. Got the oysters which were phenomenal, and the tenderloin/lobster tail.  If I had to pick the steak was sightly underdone and the lobster was slightly overdone - not a big deal, great night."}
{"text":"I went to Capital Grille with a friend for dinner, when making a reservation I asked the dress code and was told \"evening casual.\"  So we dressed appropriately, but we were seated next to a large group of people wearing jean shorts and jerseys.  I'm not trying to be a snob, but if a place has a dress code why is it not enforced? This group also continued to carry on vulgar conversation (f-this, f-that).  If I wanted to hear that I would be at the NASCAR store, not an Uptown restaurant.  I should have requested a different table, but that group departed soon after and I left it alone.  The service was 5-stars.  Our waitress attended to our every need and we had a delightful dinner, absolutely top notch.  The food was a bit disappointing.  The steaks were cooked perfectly to order, but they were nothing special.  They were not particularly tender or seasoned with anything I could taste.  The sides were fantastic.  I don't know if we just went on an off night, but for the prices they were charging the meat fell far short.  If not for that, I would give the place 5 stars."}
{"text":"My my my! Capital Grille is such an elegant establishment. Let's start with when you call in and make your reservations, they ask you what's the occasion. When you get their and is seating they acknowledge that occasion. The service was everything and more. Without asking the server told us about the specials of the day and described them in great detail. The place is nicely designed and very inviting. Capital Grille is located in the busy area of uptown Charlotte so you have to park in paid places. I ordered a porterhouse steak and my guest ordered a bone in ribeye. The restaurant is a la carte therefore we ordered a shareable lobster Mac & cheese along with some asparagus. The steak was mouth watering and the lobster Mac & Cheese was everything I was expecting and more. I will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"First dining experience at the Capital Grille for my husband and we were so very impressed by not only the atmosphere and the amazing food but the OUTSTANDING service by our waiter Les.  Top notch gentleman! We never had to wait for absolutely anything he knew the best cut of steak and offered the Porterhouse absolutely divine!!!!"}
{"text":"An excellent addition to the area.  Prices are high, but portions can be shared to reduce the ultimate cost.  Service was excellent. Ron, a server formerly with The Cheesecake Factory, recognized us and was our server.  Jill, one of the managers, recognized me from one of the restaurants she formerly worked at.  It was like \"old home week,\" which added to our enjoyment. This is more of a special occasion place to visit."}
{"text":"We always have a great meal and the service is 5 stars. They give you plenty of time to finish your appetizers and you don't feel like you are being rushed out. The Calamari and truffle fries are our Favorite along with the 10oz Filet. Don't forget the cheesecake because its the best!"}
{"text":"The Capital Grille is fantastic!  A bit of a pretentious crowd in the bar area but that's what you would expect....  Filet cooked rare with lobster macaroni on the side is my ideal 'last meal' before I die.  Service is great except one time we got a young waiter here that thought that since we were a little young that we wanted to be spoken to with 'true dat..and word'.  Not sure if this moron still works there but overall service over the years has been good."}
{"text":"One of rhe best steak hubs ..... lovely staff and excellent food in quality and varaiety ....."}
{"text":"Yes. It still sucks.  Got dragged there with some out of towners.   Begged them to go somewhere else.   I should have known better.  Meat dry and cold. Took forever to get served and they made a mistake on the bill and refused to correct it.  hopefully the golf watchers and car buyers don't mind over paying for food that would be better at Ponderosa or Sizzler"}
{"text":"Best service ever with Omega. He was attentive, polite, made every effort to accommodate us. It was a late anniversary dinner for my wife and I, so he brought out a rose at the beginning of dinner and a free desert at the end. The food itself was excellent as always."}
{"text":"I love the seating here it is very private and comfortable. The customer service here is amazing as well. Our server helped us find the right bottle of wine that tasted exactly how we wanted. Not to mention my entree! I got the citrus salmon and it is by far my favorite salmon I've had! I ate the whole plate, (I even went in saying I wanted something smaller) And the Au gratin potatoes here with the crunched up homemade potato chips are so delicious! I never eat leftovers but I boxed those up and ate the rest the next day!!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best place to get a steak. Sides are family style and very delicious.  They also serve my favorite bottle of wine here (Burly's Cabernet) so to be able to enjoy this wine with a delicious filet is one great evening out!!!"}
{"text":"My dining mates and I went to the Capital Grille for restaurant week . The reservation was actually made months ahead of time because the restaurant gets packed .  The restaurant has a  very comfortable atmosphere  and the service was excellent . I would rate a 5 but I couldn't because of some inconsistancies  which I will explain below.   The bread basket had delicious  assorted breads such as cracker bread ,onion  bread ,  pumpernickel etc.  served with butter.  The bread display and bread was wonderful to look and to eat .    We ordered  from the special menu for restaurant week. Many of us had the wedge salad with a blue cheese dressing smoked bacon and tomatoes.  Many  of the salads were loaded with tomatoes and blue cheese dressing and the smoked bacon  but some of the salads hardly had any plated tomatoes or smoked bacon .  It would have been nice to have consistency  with all the salads.   Some of us ordered the New England clam chowder which   was delicious.    Most of us also  ordered some kind of steak . The filet minion was tender plated  on a naked plate.  In my opinion there should have been some greens to dress it up a bit.  The  kona rubbed  18 oz  steak was very good . The porcini  rubbed  sliced filet was  was excellent and plated with a delicious  sauce  with tomatoes. One dining mate ordered his filet well-done but it came back with a pink center so he had to return it and wait another 10 minutes while another well-done filet was prepared for him . The staff apologized  and gave him a free glass of wine while he waited.    I ordered the salmon which  I thought was a bit dry and could have had more sauce on  the plate. It was served over  a bed of crunchy green beans almost raw,  which I thought.   The family style sides that came to the table were mashed potatoes, almost a puree but  very delicious . Also  sauteed  green beans  mixed in  with a  very few sauteed tomatoes  and onions were  very good and more tender than my plain green beans plated  with my salmon.   Dessert was excellent : creme Brule and a  rich flourless chocolate cake.  Those who ordered  the creme Brule  said it was wonderful.  All in all this was a wonderful dinner,  prices were moderate for restaurant week otherwise  regular menu a bit pricey , food came to the table hot and  service was excellent. A great wine list. We all would return again."}
{"text":"Ordered Filet. Was a Little the dry side but tender. Mashed potatoes were a little thin. Service was great and they were busy. Walked in without a reservation."}
{"text":"First visit to the Capital Grill for lunch. The Lobster Bisque soup was the best I have tried in Las Vegas. Large chunks of lobster made it a winner. Next the ribeye sandwich was a delight. The cut of steak was as thick as a large burger and just as tender. Another winner. Service is excellent and we'll be back for dinner."}
{"text":"The Capital Grille... I'm a fan.   The menu is one of a basic steakhouse (salads, soups, steaks, seafood). Their appetizers are well made, I particularly like their blue wedge salad, but their onion soup is a close second. On the menu for the second course you have to get one of their signature dishes (Kona crusted sirloin or the Porcini crusted Delmonico with aged balsamic - my all time favorite!)  Drinks and cocktails are good and they have a good wine list. Their desserts are nothing out of this world (but I'm not a dessert guy). The service is clean and proper.  Good place to begin night on the town in uptown Charlotte."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday and it was THE BEST/TOP OF THE LINE service and food I have ever had. Everyone is unbelievably nice, you don't feel like you're in Phoenix, and on top of it all, you get your money's worth of food!!"}
{"text":"In a hurry to get back to work, I ordered the lobster mac and cheese to go.   Atmosphere: Upon arrival, I noticed that the place was neat and the customers happy. Wish I could stay and enjoy my meal there.   Food: I read a review that there were \"huge chunks of lobster\" in this bowl. This was not the case with my Togo order. I maybe had a full 1-2 pieces of lobster about an inch in length. Maybe they were having an off day... but that's all I got. Quite disappointing considering the price. I might as well have ordered a single lobster tail."}
{"text":"I took my wife here for Valentines Day, a nice perk was complimentary chocolate strawberries for the two of us and  a very nice red rose for my wife presented after our meal. The atmosphere was excellent, our waiter was exceptional and stayed on top of our meal. The \"Sam's\" mashed potatoes were exceptional and were the green beans.  My FILET MIGNON was done to perfection and cut easily.  My wife's FILET MIGNON  was cooked properly but the meat was tough and stringy, a huge disappointment. For the price we paid I expected a better cut of meat.  Other items on the menu might be very good but we will never know as we will not go back.  There are other fine dining options in the Phoenix area and we plan to explore as many of the top 10 OpenTable restaurants  in the next few months."}
{"text":"First stop for restaurant week -- and it was an outstanding choice! Capital Grille, you didn't disappoint. We were seated promptly, waited on with such kindness and attention to detail, the food was outstanding (that filet Mignon was killer), and all around enjoyed the atmosphere. The entire staff, from our waiter to the hostess to everyone in between who poured our water and brought out our entrees, was so exceptionally friendly. THIS restaurant is worth the price! We will return next time we're craving an amazing steak or killer martini. (Stoli Doli is awesome!!!)  One of my new favorites in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best dining experience in a while. great food, normal people portions and outstanding service. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Visited this steak house in Vegas. It was nice. The waitstaff was friendly. It's a little older and not on the new main area of the strip but it has a decent view of the old Vegas strip. The food is pricey but just ok. I had the fish and it was nothing too overwhelming. Rather bland. The drink menu was pretty extensive and probably the highlight. All in all a little overpriced for the food."}
{"text":"I am not a meat person, so not too familiar with the different kinds of meats. $77 for just a lobster tail and a piece of meat (not sure what kind I got). The meat was nasty, dry, and a waste of money. I didn't even eat it. I have enjoyed steak WAY more at way cheaper places like Cheesecake Factory or Outback. I am a local so I don't care for the whole dining on the strip with the view, but it was a friend's birthday and she chose this place. I also had a small plate of asparagus for $11 and ceasar salad for $11. Overpriced restaurant for what it really is. Not on a budget, but nothing that I had, other than the lobster tail was worth the price. Some of my friends got chicken, which they all complained was too dry. The only things that were actually good were the mashed potatoes and mac n cheese.  What completely ruined my dining experience to the point that I gave it 1 star was because of how cold it was in there. My whole group of 9 were complaining about how hard the AC was hitting us the whole night. Yes it was that bad."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Great service, with a great view, and delicious food. How can you top it?  Filet on the bone.  Salmon. Brussel sprouts. Butternut squash bisque. Artisian breads. ALL delicious!  Stellar service. Attentive and responsive.  Seated at Strip window made for delightful dining.  Of all the places in Vegas to dine, I will be back."}
{"text":"This was the most amazing eating experience I've ever had. Pricey, but worth every penny IMO. The service was excellent.  I ordered the Filet Oscar medium rare & it was perfect. Lobster mac & cheese was everything I'd heard about. It actually didn't need the lobster. The mac & cheese on it's own was great. My wife had a bone-in filet that she hasn't stopped talking about a day later.  Frankly, not a place we could afford to go to often. But for a special occasion, I can think of no better place."}
{"text":"The Capital Grille Scottsdale is definitely one of the better restaurants in the Valley.  The meal was excellent. I enjoyed lobster bisque and scallops served over risotto; the rolls were hot and delicious. The service was excellent. The staff is very attentive.  The main course and the dessert presentations were artfully done.  Minor point: If the espresso had been served in an espresso cup, it would have been hotter (more to my liking)."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner and drinks tonight. Our server Tony was excellent and did a great job.  Had the wahoo kolby beef steak and it was worth every penny."}
{"text":"Linda Kammeyer has made our event a smashing success!  Love this place because of her!  Best spoiling event location in town."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our 8 year anniversary here last night. We arrived 30 minutes early and were allowed to move our reservation up and were promptly seated. The male host was very friendly and knowledgeable. He answered questions about the wine lockers and kept us engaged while we waited to be seated. When we made it to our table, there were cute confetti hearts and a hand written card from the restaurant congratulating us on our anniversary. It was a really nice touch and very appreciated. Our server Frank was AMAZING! Hands down the best service we have ever received! Frank provided us with complementary champagne, a nice bite of a smoked salmon dish, and cheesecake. He anticipated things that we wouldn't have thought of. When he marked the table before our appetizer, he brought an extra soup spoon in case I wanted to try my husband's soup. This was extremely thoughtful. As busy as he was with a larger table, he never missed a beat with us and was constantly checking in and bringing more things to try to the table. He continually offered to take pictures of us so we had souvenirs for the night and maintained hilarious and personal conversations with us throughout the night so we felt like old friends. The food was outstanding and cooked to perfection. The evening was the highlight of our anniversary weekend and I appreciate the staff of Capital Grille at Fashion Show mall for their generous hospitality. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Fine dining and elegant decor without the pretentious attitude.  Great happy hour bar with the famous \"Paul\" bartending since 2004'.  Ask for a Stoli Doli Pineapple Martini and you will not regret it.  The Porcini Delmonico Steak and Lobster Mac n Cheese rule!!"}
{"text":"I made reservations here after I found out STK was booked. Boy am I glad they were booked because this place rocks!  Service was spectacular and the food was amazing. My girlfriend and I started off with a few cocktails which we're good. She had the cosmopolitan and I had the gin lime basil. For appetizers we had the shrimp cocktail which were fresh. I ordered the bone in kona crusted dry aged sirloin with shallot butter which just melted in my mouth. This is how meat should be cooked!! My girlfriend who's a mac and cheese freak ordered the lobster mac and cheese and said this was the best ever. On a side note my girl left her cell phone and I promptly got a call back from the restaurant saying it would be out front with the host."}
{"text":"The Capital Grille...I've eaten at the ones in Chicago and Las Vegas, but there was just something about this one that I didn't care for.  Seems like their selection has gone down possibly?  I'm definitely a steak eater and have no problem spending that much money (they seem to be pricier that I remember--and they are a chain, none the less) on one, but that particular night I didn't really have a taste for a steak...or chicken or fish...Unfortunately those were the only options beside salad.  Would I eat there again?  Probably not.  There are so many other restaurant options in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, I would suggest going elsewhere--unless you enjoy ordering a sub par steak from a small menu."}
{"text":"Had dinner here again recently.  I used to dine here a few times a week back in the day.  This is still an exceptional restaurant.  It's been too long since my last visit.  Always good."}
{"text":"Conclusion: Top notch, great service and great food.  The breakdown:  I would say a good dining experience is the sum of the food, the environment, and the service.  So...the lady and I decided on a whim that the Capital Grille would be the AZ Restaurant pick of the evening. We went after late evening at work...my environment is pretty casual, so I was in t-shirt and shorts. Even on a Tu night it seemed the general atmosphere was business casual.  We were greeted and seated as soon as we came in and appeared no judgments were made. We then waited.  ....and waited.....and waited.  I was beginning to wonder if they didn't like my attire or something.  We noticed it seemed there was a huddle between the wait staff wondering who would take our table. Still no one.  I got up to use the rest room and when I got back my lady said they were bringing out some calamari on the house for our wait.  Sweet!  I generally don't care one anyone the other about calamari...but theirs was really good.  A bit of. A spice, a little kick...but quite tasty.  The waiter was extremely apologetic about our wait and was on top of everything afterwards.  I got the bone in sirloin, lady the filet.  Both were very tasty and cooked to our liking.  The mashed potatoes were delicious...creamy and buttery tasting.  Green beans tasty and crisp.  The espresso chocolate cake dessert...oh my was it rich.  A little chocolate sauce or more raspberry sauce would have been a welcome addition to the dollop of whip cream and raspberries but it was still tasty..   But the final action that really put the experience over the top was when the bill was supposed to come and instead the manager said dinner was on them.  They did not want to leave us with a bad experience (esp. considering it was our first time there.). I tried telling him this was unnecessary as they already more than made up for many issues.  They insisted...so the waiter ended up with a pretty good tip out of it.  That was all class though and made me feel quite good about our dining choice. The way they handled things and the food quality even prior to that would have gotten them at least 4 stars.  But the fact they have proven themselves a class act...that puts them over the top.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I usually don't go to a steakhouse just for appetizers, but let's make an exception. The lobster Mac was fun, and the lobster crab cakes were awesome! The calamari was alright... Our server was really snooty because we ordered apps and not big expensive steaks. Boo on him!!"}
{"text":"A group of six of us had dinner here. We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share and also got our own entrees. I don't usually eat beef, but I couldn't resist the 10 ounce filet mignon. I also took the option of adding crab legs, which was delicious but I'm not sure if I would do again as they added $25 to the cost of my entree for only 3 legs. (I think I'll stick to the cheaper option of Red Lobster for crab legs.) The steak, however, was delicious.   If you're a fan of macaroni and cheese, definitely try the side dish of  lobster mac 'n' cheese. It's delicious and is made with panko bread crumbs."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner! Steak was perfect, Mac & cheese w/ lobster was truly delightful and the coconut cream pie was phenomenal!  Pretty pricey ... Would have been 5star if just a bit more affordable!"}
{"text":"I ate here on a Sunday evening with my family during their visit to Charlotte.  My sister's sirloin, which she ordered medium rare, was brought to the table over cooked and the server noticed immediately and insisted an order be put in for a new steak. He even packed the over cooked steak for us to take home since both my sister and uncle ordered their meat well done.   The food was as good as the service,  I ordered the sliced filet over a bed of mushrooms and my aunt who is not a steak eater, thoroughly enjoyed her herb roasted chicken (I tasted it too, it was juicy and perfectly seasoned.) Make sure you save room for dessert!  The special was carrot cake, about 4 layers of moist spicy goodness layered between not too sweet cream cheese frosting. The flourless chocolate espresso cake was my favorite, its gluten free snd extremely rich, definitely for sharing.  The hazelnut chocolate cake was alright, another huge portion definitely enough to share."}
{"text":"This was our first venture to The Capital Grille and it was a very enjoyable experience. We normally stay away from the craziness of the Strip since we live in Vegas but after looking at their website and having received a $50 off gift card from American Express we decided to give it a try.  After a little confusion as to where the front entrance was located we were promptly seated in a corner that allowed us a panoramic view of the strip which was beautiful as we were right across from the Wynn.  It was lunch time however they were not very busy, quiet atmosphere and very comfortable. Our server was very attentive and pleasant.   I normally shy away from crab cakes as I have been sorely disappointed in the past--too much breading or too greasy. However our server explained that their Lobster & Crab Cakes are pan seared then baked in the oven and \"wonderful\". And she was correct. I thoroughly enjoyed them  as they had large chucks of both lobster & crab and not just shredded pieces. For my lunch entree I decided on the Main Lobster Salad with Champagne Vinaigrette which was just as enjoyable. The vinaigrette was light and truly accented the taste of the lobster which included large chunks of lobster as well as the claw meat.  I would certainly order both again...   My husband ordered a steak with mashed potatoes- his steak was cooked to order and he very much enjoyed his selection as well.   We are planning on returning as there were several other items that peaked our interest especially on the dinner menu. I am hoping our night time visit is just as relaxing and enjoyable.   My one suggestion would be to check out their on-line menu to have an idea of what you may want as there are seemingly many tasty items to select from."}
{"text":"This is a Lunch Review.  This was the last stop of our \"Vegas Food Tour\" before we trotted our butts back to Los Angeles. We decided to go here because they were apart of restaurant week and they were offering the most diverse selection on their pre-fixed menu compared to other places participating. It was $30.10 per person for a 3-course lunch.  My first impressing upon walking in to this place was... \"YOU FANCY HUH?!?!\" Its located in the fashion show mall, so I wasn't really expecting anything super fancy, but it was. White table clothes, dark wood, wine glasses, and lunch having executives. We were greeted by the host, a not so friendly older lady, who didn't really give us the impression that she wanted us to eat there. But we shrugged it off and the service actually ended up being pretty good.   1st course: I went for the clam chowder. This dish was actually a pleasant surprise due to its copious amounts of clams. It had a nice creamy but not too oily soup base with my oh so favorite oyster crackers! The GF went for the french onion soup. I wasn't much of a fan, I thought it was a bit too salty but she on the other hand likes that kinda thing so she loved it. It was the run of the mill french onion soup IMHO.  2nd course: She was starving so she opted for the The Grille's Signature Cheeseburger with truffle fries. This was a very large sirloin patty with smoked bacon, sweet onions, and havarti cheese on an onion roll. If you have an appetite I would most likely suggest this burger because its huge. The truffle fries were delish and friend to perfection. I went for the Seared Citrus Glazed Salmon. It was a large filet of salmon seared to perfection over some asparagus and onions. It was probably one of the most juiciest salmons I've ever had.   3rd course: We went for the usual creme brulee which I think is pretty much the same at most locations. Its pretty hard to do a creme brulee wrong, but of course Capital Grille's was ginormous. And we also got the Strawberries Capital Grille that consisted of fresh strawberries and vanilla ice cream topped with Grand Marnier. This was mediocre, some sweeter strawberries probably would have helped the cause.  For what we paid, we definitely got a deal with the enormous portions they served. It was a nice place but the food wasn't super memorable. Dinner may be a different story."}
{"text":"First timer to The Capital Grille, decided to check them out for Restaurant Week and we were finally able to score a reservation!  We arrived early so decided to have a drink at the bar, but that turned into 2 drinks and ouch our tab was expensive! I wish we had been running late instead!  We were seated right on time for our reservation - this is very important to me - I hate when restaurants make you wait more than 10-15 minutes to be seated.  Our waiter greeted us promptly, explained the Restaurant Week menu and showed us the regular menu and the wine list. We both wanted to try the RW menu - I had the filet and my husband had the bone in Kona crusted sirloin. We also had salads and sides for the table. Dessert was crème brulee and flourless chocolate cake (both = yummm).   The food came out quickly (maybe too fast?) and our waiter checked on us just the right amount. The food was very good. Not quite up to my favorite steak restaurant (Del Frisco's) in terms of quality of food or atmosphere. But the service was excellent. It just feels outdated in there and the steak wasn't that melt-in-your-mouth quality that I want from a high-end steak house.  I am glad I tried The Capital Grille and I would go back - but it probably wouldn't be my first choice for an exquisite steak in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Selected for a private party of 12, we enjoyed the Wine Room as a group for dinner and drinks on a Sat night.   The room was perfect- a square set up so everyone could be together and enjoy convo and share the al la carte sides. Our server, Chad, was super sweet and on top of it. Not a moment went by without our glasses filled or a finished plate cleared.   I had an amazing steak- of course- which I do not eat often because once you have it at a place like this, it is hard to imagine trying to duplicate. I put the creamed spinich on top and it was amazing. I also sampled the lobster mac and cheese which tempted me to lick the plate and also the lobster bisque. WOW. Seriously, everything knocked my pants off.  It seemed like all hands on deck kept the night smooth and us feeling taken care of. Outstanding service is so rare, and I must compliment the team there for being friendly- not snotty or unapproachable- and very attentive.   Perfect for a special nite out or a group in the private room."}
{"text":"One of the best meals of my 2016!  Tender flavorful filet cooked to perfection with creamy mashed potatoes.  An enjoyable glass of wine.  So relieved they did not add garlic to the potatoes as so many places do.  Flourless chocolate espresso cake was dense and very chocolatey.  My waiter Chris was knowledgeable and helpful without being overbearing.  A great  splurge meal - definitely worth the  extra $$ and extra calories.  I only eat beef 4 - 6 times a year and this was THE place to order beef though I could have been tempted by the lobster or sea bass too."}
{"text":"I like the ambiance - but the food was just ok. I ordered green salad with herbs, filet mignon and the espresso cake from the \"restaurant week\" menu.  The salad was nothing spectacular. The filet mignon was a little tough for me and the espresso cake tasted more like an espresso fudge brownie - it was really rich.  I had a great time with friends there, but I doubt I will come back."}
{"text":"I had a business meeting there today and Nicole was our server. She was very attentive and helpful when making recommendations.  I had the chicken Cesar Salad. It was not as I had imagined it would be; a Cesar Salad with strips of chicken or cubed chicken. It was a Cesar Salad with a chicken leg and thigh on the side. This was my favorite part of the chicken and it was cooked very well, moist and tender.  I will be back for more than just lunch meetings for sure!"}
{"text":"Fantastic dining experience!   The service we received by Alex Fu and the entire staff was impeccable. Everything from the wine, to the cocktails, appetizers, entree and dessert was amazing.   We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Staff was very professional.  The place is a bit loud if they are having to explain what dishes or specials they have available to you.  I had the Chilean Sea Bass as the main.  The fish itself was a little dry and boring but when sprinkled with the broth is quite delicious despite how I usually do not like soy sauce.  I shared/split my portion with another associate at the table so I also got to try bone-in rib eye steak which was ver juicy.  The steak was requested as medium rare though maybe half of it was cooked rare instead.  We also had asparagus and soy glazed bacon brussels sprouts.  The asparagus was cooked to the point where too many stalks were blackened, dry, and crunchy while the sprouts were glazed too intensely with soy sauce in my opinion.  Desserts were as expected.  In summary, for the price one would expect all of the dishes to be cooked and taste properly AND, our waiter stole the electronic drink menu/tablet plaything from me."}
{"text":"This is one of the best steakhouses we've ever been to. The staff takes excellent care of you and the meal was timed perfectly. While you will pay a pretty penny for the meal- it's definitely worth it!  Fun fact, they also filmed a scene of Shallow Hal at this location."}
{"text":"Stopped in to sit at the bar for a snack and a few drinks while staying at the Hyatt in Legacy. This is a nice addition to Legacy Village dining options. The price point is higher than the other options, but the service and food is excellent.   Upon walking in, we were greeted with friendly smiles and, once announcing our intentions to sit at the bar, were told any of the high top seating in that area was open for first come first serve. The atmosphere lighting was very dim, on the edge of too dark to read the menus. The decor was dark wood old American type style. It was relaxing and pub like, but I would have appreciated a bit more lighting.   We were welcomed by bartender Nathan and given a tablet style menu identical with to the written one, which made reading easier for aging eyes! We ordered off their cocktail menu both the \"in fashioned\" and the blackberry bourbon sidecar. Both hand crafted cocktails were excellent. Next Nathan gave us a basket of a variety of wonderful breads and a slab of salted butter along with samples of their pineapple infused vodka they call Stoli Doli. It was so good that I ordered this drink next. It was cold, light and refreshing and went down very easily! We also tried the manhattan 46... another winner.   We tried their tenderloin sliders off the bar menu. The meat was perfectly seasoned and cooked. One of the three sliders didn't seem as nice of a piece of meat as the other two to me. I figure they might be trying to utilize the scraps from trimming the steaks, which is smart. They had a smear of Boursin cheese and came on toasted brioche buns. I thought they were slightly unimpressive at $18, but good. Won't get them again. They needed something more to make them seem less like scraps.   I'm sure we will be back to try some different things off the menu. The cocktails and friendly bar service alone were fabulous and worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Vegas, I always have dinner here on the last night. I highly recommend the cold shellfish platter with oysters, the bone-in filet (which is not on the menu but usually always a special), lobster mac, and their cheesecake. I tried a new after dinner drink that was recommended to me by Erik (great service you should ask for him) is called the Carajillo... just do it. It's amazing.   We usually show up around 6:30pm to get the best view of the strip. bon appetit. :)"}
{"text":"Seldom had better service and the food was terrific. I prefer this type of steak house to Morton's or Ruth's Chris....YMMV"}
{"text":"Visited The Capital Grille for our anniversary.  The hostess asked if we were celebrating anything special and she could tell by our hesitation that we were uncomfortable divulging the fact that it was our anniversary but we told her any way.  She came back to our table and decorated it with heart confetti and presented us with a card.  Very thoughtful and classy!  We were greeted by our very friendly waitress who took our drink order and told us about the specials for the evening.  We were given a basket full of various breads, all of which were very tasty.  The waitress then brought out a cucumber salmon appetizer which we did not order but was very delicious.  I opted for the special of two filet minon tenderloins topped with shrimp scampi.  TO DIE FOR!!!  The meat was tender and cooked just right and the scampi sauce was like no scampi sauce I've ever had before which made it so delicious!  The scampi sauce on top of the steak...amazing!!!  My husband had the Dry Aged Sirloin Steak which had great flavor and was very moist and tender.  We ordered a side of asparagus to share which was also very good but maybe had a bit too much lemon flavor for my taste.  We opted to skip dessert because our meal was so filling and delicious but because it was our anniversary they brought us dessert anyway.  It consisted of a light and fluffy cheesecake brûlée that was out of this world as well as a flourless chocolate cake that was also delicious.  Both desserts were served with a side of fresh berries and sauce.  Our experience at The Capital Grille was second to none and I would definitely suggest this place to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Dry aged steak anyone? Seriously. I was a bit iffy about this place. Only because when it comes to Beachwood and places like this. People tend to frown because of my tattoos. (Sad, I know)  But, we were treated very warmly and were sat right away. The staff was extremely pleasant and the place was clean and bright.   Our food? Oh my gosh! It was incredible. I had a steak cooked medium rare and it literally cut like butter. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Best place for lunch, always a 5 star service! Also best burger in town during lunch, and amazing steak, fantastic wine selection. Expensive but well worth the experience."}
{"text":"We had the porter house, the kona crusted steak, lobster Mac and cheese, truffle fries, and calamari. I can easily say the only thing impressive was the steak and the wine menu. The kona crusted steak was fabulous! Both steaks were cooked perfectly. The service was wonderful and the view of the strip gorgeous. But I had to give it three stars based on how mediocre the calamari, fries, and Mac and cheese were. Pretty disappointing. The lobster was chewy and over cooked, and was more of a béchamel cream sauce than Mac and cheese. The fries were so greasy, and the calamari was just average."}
{"text":"Exhausted from Black Friday shopping, I needed a meat fix. Decided on lunch at a The Capital Grill Biltmore and was blown away. I had dined there a couple of times in the past but it was just special this time.  Our server Shay was outstanding. She introduced herself and immediately I knew she was going to be great. Very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Part of what made her so great was that she shared her passion for food and cooking. Anyone can be a good server, but it takes someone like Shay with her passion to be a great server, especially in a high end restaurant.   Moving on to the food.... Shay recommended the lunch size filet with prawn scampi. Served with a choice of side, I picked the mashed potatoes.   This meal was just perfect in every way. A nice size filet and four large prawns on top. There aren't words to describe how good the scampi sauce was...garlic, butter and actually a little spicy. The mashed potatoes could not have been better, seasoned just right and made with butter and cream. I am excited just writing about it and I can't wait to go back!  Everyone in my party had the same thing and we all agreed how great this meal was.   So...Want a recommendation? Try the fillet and prawn scampi next time you are at The Capital Grill. They do it for lunch and dinner with a larger filet served for the dinner.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend for a late Valentine's day date on Sunday night. It was my first time here and I loved it. Erik was our server and he made amazing suggestions from the menu. We ordered everything he suggested and we were not disappointed.   For drinks my boyfriend ordered a beer and Erik suggested a pineapple infused vodka drink that was served straight up in a chilled martini glass. It was delicious. The perfect blend of tangy and sweet.   For appetizers, we ordered the lobster bisque and the wedge salad. Erik added some sherry to my lobster bisque at the table that really brought out the rich flavor of the soup. I had a couple bites of the wedge salad and it was crisp and refreshing. Both were perfect portions.  For our entrees we had the Delmonico steak which is their bone in rib eye and the Filet Oscar which was a filet topped with blue crab meat and a Bearnaise sauce served with asparagus spears. Both entrees tasted amazing. The rib eye had excellent flavor and even the slight char from the grill tasted good. The crab meat on the Fillet Oscar was sweet and the flavors flowed together perfectly.  We also shared the sides of creamed spinach and creamy mashed potatoes. They complimented our meals nicely and tasted really fresh.  We were too stuffed to try dessert but I had my eye on every creme brulee that passed by. Next time I will make sure to save room for it. We ended our meal with a coffee and an espresso.  The manager stopped by our table to ask how our meal was which is always a nice touch to see managers engaging with the guests dining in their establishment. There is also a great sense of teamwork among the servers. Many times I saw other servers clearing tables that weren't their own or grabbing dirty dishes out of another server's hands while he was at another table speaking with his guests. It's nice to see the wait staff help each other out and care about the appearance of the restaurant and the service being provided to all guests, not just their own.  If you're looking for a great meal with a gorgeous view of the strip lit up at night and even better service, come here for dinner. Ask to sit in Erik's section. He'll ensure you have a great experience and leave you wanting to come back again."}
{"text":"Somewhat your typical overpriced steakhouse without much creativity. Average entrées in the high 40s and everything is à la cart and the seafood selection is without much inspiration. Salmon dish that is farm raised for $36, sea scallops, Ahi tuna and Chilean Seabass.  Side dishes average about $10 each. Went to the bar after dinner and add additional drinks and ask for something to munch on. They served what is commonly referred to as cottage fries or homemade potato chips which were the worst I've ever had. Many restaurants in Cleveland serve these and they are quite good but at the capital Grille they are soggy and and without any redeeming qualities. There were three of us and none of us would go back"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Corey Bohanan isn't a Manager. He is a joke. He should be ashamed. Throwing his card at me. My husband and I come two to three times a week after work for drinks and dinner. Definitely will be looking for a new venue. Shame on him and the service we received tonight"}
{"text":"We came here for NYE and it was fabulous. The best part about our dining experience was our server Frankie. He's one of those people that leave a lasting impression on you. I'll miss his funny small talk; memories of how his mother used to make his bed so tight that it made him feel as though he were sleeping in an envelope. And, to this day when he stays in a hotel he asks housekeeping to please not tuck his bed sheets in. Laughable indeed. We were given complimentary champagne for my bday that I mentioned was a few weeks prior. That put a huge smile on our face. Then, came out a goat cheese and apple amuse-bouche; a wonderful thank you from the chef to wet our pallets. Loved the garlic flavored warm bread served complimentary prior to the meal. We shared a fantastic bone in ribeye which had been marinated in an aged balsamic vinaigrette. It was wonderful. The star of the show from my fiancé's perspective were the au gratin potatoes. I'd have to agree they were very good, just a bit rich for my taste that evening. The star of the show from my perspective last 100 percent lead lobster bisque. I was absolutely in love with the large chunks of lobster in my bisque. I'll be dreaming of this soup throughout the winter season.  The service was over the top of spectacular. The food was absolutely fantastic and it was an enjoyable New Year's eve atmosphere.  Bravo Capital Grille! I'm a fan once again!"}
{"text":"Out for date night and we chose this place to try something new and man am I happy we did.  The service from start to finish was absolutely fantastic.  Not one moment did I want for anything they were always around but not intrusive.  I ordered the porter house and they did such an amazing job with the steak! Perfectly cooked perfectly flavored just all around delicious.  The asparagus and Sams potatoes were outstanding. The cheddar soup was meh but still good if you added enough pepper.  Decor is a little weird which I've seen other people post, think stuffy country club style. Overall it was a great experience and we will be back.  Great service and great food was worth the $200 dinner."}
{"text":"When I think of business dinners, I think of Capital Grille. The dish that stands out the most at this steakhouse is the NY strip. The bone-in Kona coffee-crusted dry aged NY strip with shallot butter is a must try. For an off-the-bone option, try the 14 oz. NY strip au poivre with courvoisier cream. Both are delicious with their accompanying sauces. The earthy roasted wild mushrooms are the perfect side. I also enjoyed the mashed potatoes and the green beans.  For appetizers, the steak tartare was beautifully prepared. The lobster and crab cakes are small in size, but the side of roasted corn was delicious. Like any fine steakhouse, there's a great wedge salad. The bleu cheese isn't too overwhelming and the smoked bacon is more cubed than crumbs.   Save room for dessert because the cheesecake brûlée is excellent and even better than the classic creme brûlée. The flourless chocolate espresso cake is a rich and decadent gluten-free option that is sure to please both gluten and non-gluten eaters alike. All around, the service is top notch and the drinks are great too. Unlike a lot of steakhouses on the Strip, most of their steaks are reasonably priced in the $50 range. It's an expensive meal for sure, but you get your bang for your buck and will leave stuffed."}
{"text":"What can I say... It's a 5 star restaurant for a reason. From service, to food, to Ambien. 5 Star All The Way! I've only eaten here for lunch in the past. If this was my first time getting here for dinner. My wife took me out for my birthday and wow what a treat!  The raisin bread and onion bread are a must! The butter had a firm cheese-like consistency and was extremely flavorful. For drinks, my wife had reisling and I had two cocktails. My first was the \"In Fashion\" and this was by far the STRONGEST cocktail I've ever had in my life. It had the perfect blend of bourbon and bitters that just made me want to smoke a cigar. My second drink was the grapefruit Fire and Ice which had two different tequilas and was infused with Fresno peppers. Spicy but delicious!  I had the lamb chops and they were delicious. I got them well done and very few restaurants know how to do this without burning them. Lamb chops are the only things I have to eat well done. He came with a cherry reduction sauce however so it was very good and wasn't necessary. The lamb chops were seasoned to perfection. My wife and I shared the potatoes augratin and the sauteed mushrooms. These were some of the best mushrooms I've ever had. So I've only been here for lunch I can't wait to come back for dinner. Everything was amazing!"}
{"text":"The steak was cooked to perfection  .  Staff  is very friendly. Nice place to hang out."}
{"text":"Yeah, this is a chain and yeah it's pricey.  However, the food is top notch and the service is impeccable.  Truly, the service we had the other night was a gold standard.  Our waiter was excellent with recommendations, honest about some menu choices, and extremely attentive and personal.  This is a fantastic spot for a special occasion.  I ate at the Capital Grille in Indianapolis (see that review here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-capital-grille-indianapolis#hrid:z4sbFRVo63w9b03-VEvxOg) the night I got engaged and they did many special things for us.  At my recent experience at the Pittsburgh location, I watched the same personal treatment unfold at a nearby table for a young couple's anniversary.  I recommend the lobster mac n cheese as a side along with the wedge salad and Delmonico cut steak.  You can have any preparation on any steak, so just ask.  You will get plenty of food and be full, so order wisely to avoid wasting money (though this stuff makes for some delicious leftovers).  The Strawberries Capital Grille is ok, but the mixed berries with cream is better.  Valet parking is complimentary."}
{"text":"I had a dreadful lunch here. Ordered the clam chowder: watery and flavorless; had to load on the tabasco to extract even a little flavor.  Then had the \"famous\" burger; I ordered it medium. Came out well-done: hard and dry and flavorless. Truffle fries were cold, hard and truffle-less. My buddy had the New York well-done; it came out medium rare.  Here's the rule: when a steakhouse can't get a steak right, plus can't get a burger right, it has no right to exist, especially in the steakhouse/burger hub of the west coast.  And by the way, we pointed it out to the manager showing her the burger and the steak; she took note, feigned concern and then charged for both of them anyway.  Capital C. Capital R. Capital A. Capital P.  Capital Grille."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews but I have to make an exception because of my experience today at The Capital Grille. This is my favorite restaurant, but I don't usually go there unless it is a business expense, because of the more upscale pricing.  Today is our 10th wedding anniversary. We had been having a wonderful day and were about to top it off with dinner at a nice restaurant that we frequented. We were leaving downtown and happened to pass @The Capital Grille. I made the offhanded remark that we should have made a reservation to eat there instead of the other place. My wife calls just to see if they might find us a table.  She spoke to the managing partner, Armin. He was very friendly and asked he what the occasion was. When she told him it was our anniversary, He was like \"Sure, come on. We'll definitely get you a table\"! When we arrived, with 10 minutes notice, they had a table waiting for us...A table with stars, hearts and diamond glitter stickers sprinkled all over the table cloth! The maitre' D brought us complimentary champagne and the chef also sent us complimentary appetizers. When my wife ordered the lobster, the chef also gave her the biggest lobster they offered at the same price as the smaller one.   The calamari was fantastic and had the kick of the peppers and the savory flavor of the beer batter that I remember from earlier visits. My entree' was a gorgonzola crusted sirloin with a carbernet reduction sauce. Wow! Just like I would hope for an anniversary meal. Soft and succulent. It melted on my palate like butter. Mmmm Mmmm. My wife is a small lady but she ate an entire 3 pound lobster by herself. Need I say more?  Our server Kimberly was excellent and super attentive. Our glasses were never empty. Nothing but compliments to her. Armin, the managing partner, came to talk to us several times during the meal. That personal touch made the meal very enjoyable. The chef sent us an exquisite dessert plate to end the meal as a compliment also. To top it off, Kimberly also took our picture and put it in a frame and gave it to us along with a card from the management wishing us Happy Anniversary.  If you are visiting Charlotte, you owe it to yourself to visit this great restaurant. If you live in Charlotte and can afford to splurge on a meal once in a while, if you haven't been to The Capital Grille, then shame on you! Fix that oversight now!"}
{"text":"I was there with dates three times in past week; just cant stay away. I always eat in ghe bar area and get excellent service. Their lollipop lamb chops and lobster bisque are outstanding. Bartenders Jayme and Matt are very attentive and personable.  None of my fates nor I have ever had a bad experience at Capital."}
{"text":"Happy Valentine's Day!!! This was our first time at Capital Grille, I only have amazing things to say!!!!! The night began with a wonderfully detailed intro of the menu by Jose. Everything about our meal was terrific. The attention to detail and timely fashion that each portion of the meal was presented to the table. **spoiler alert---- a hot towel, with squeezed lemon on top to clean your hands before dessert!!!!! I've seen it all, FINALLY in Cleveland, OH. 5 stars all the way......."}
{"text":"A bit of a snotty spot. When I asked for water they brought me a bottle of Fiji water which we were then charged $7 for. I meant tap. But anyhow, the food tasted great and the view was amazing. I would come here again."}
{"text":"This review is related to an order i placed through \"Postmates\" (delivery service).  Placed order around 8:00 PM though the Postmates link.  Ordered the signature cheeseburger, truffle fries, and wedge salad.  There was also an option for homemade mint lemonade or a fresh made iced tea with a simple syrup. Burger was delivered used down in half and the burger itself looked good but did not deliver on taste. this could be because it was takeout, so not too hot (although it is 5 blocks from my hotel so not a long ride). Fries were over salted, nice truffle flavor but again, seemed to have been made much earlier.  The wedge was the most disappointing because i was looking forward to what is described as wedge with blue cheese and applewood smoked bacon  Got the iceberg lettuce and some bacon but no blue cheese.  Also no utensils, or napkins.  And possibly a ranch or creamy italian dressing.  very disappointing.  Not sure this is a fair review because it was ordered though the service but should just be a pickup service that they grab the bag and deliver and because of that i think it bears mentioning that this did not live up the Capital Grill level of service and product."}
{"text":"Way overpriced!!!  $10 for a field greens salad and it sure wasn't field greens. !!!  It's so dark in the restraunt that we had to use the light from our cell phones to read the menu!   but the kicker was that they asked what we were celebrating and it was for birthday and anniversary...  They bring out 2 dessert plates one for each - but only one was complimentary... Which is fine... But they should've asked if we wanted 2 and that only one was free. Probably won't be back"}
{"text":"Great service, delicious tender steaks. Went their for a double anniversary dinner, our friends 18th anniversary and our 20th, were given champagne and delicious dessert for our special occasion."}
{"text":"There was an ice sculpture.  A Yelp ice sculpture that rotated.  Do I really need to say anything else?  Yes - I absolutely have to say more!  From the delicious food to the outstanding service the entire afternoon really made us feel welcome.  It was an added bonus to see Gabi's smiling face at the check-in table!  A highlight was being able to speak with Jennifer, Capital Grille's amazing chef.  She took the time to explain the beef aging process (CG has their own aging room there at the restaurant!), as well as to provide a few tips on what to look for when selecting beef for cooking at home.  I am very proud of myself that I had the restraint to not cram that entire display tenderloin into my purse and run out the door!    A huge Thank You to the amazing staff at the Capital Grille and to resident Yelp Rockstar Lindsey for hosting such a fantastic event."}
{"text":"Life as I know it will never be the same.  This was my thought the first time I tried the decadent luxury known as Lobster Mac n Cheese at the Capital Grille.  It is really that good.  I could visit there and just order that - that is, if If the rest of the menu wasn't so fantastic.  Each and every item I have tried has been great - among my favorites have been:  - French Onion Soup - this is a HUGE portion, with just the right amount of cheese blanketed over the top.  - Lobster Bisque - um, it has Lobster in it!  What else can I say!?  - Wedge Salad - the Applewood Smoked Bacon really makes this stand out  - Filet Mignon - I am really picky about how my filet is prepared (between Medium and Medium Rare) and they get it right each and every time.  - Lobster Mac ' Cheese - you really need to try this for yourself.  The portion of lobster is generous - not little wimpy pieces, but large chunks of succulent meat, including claws!  Want to really go over the top?  Order a 1/2 or full pound of crab legs for the table to go with your meal!  They are served shelled, so all you have to do is enjoy.   The service has been attentive without being overwhelming, which is nice.  Also, the wine list is impressive, with choices in a variety of price points.  Is this the most budget-friendly meal you will ever have?  No.  Will you be insanely happy you treated yourself to a wonderful experience?  Absolutely!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I rarely get to treat ourselves out to a night alone without the kids, we decided to celebrated our 8 year anniversary here. Reservations were convenient to make on line and a confirmation email and phone call the day before followed. During the reservation process they asked  us to tell them about ourselves, if it was a special occasion and I was please to see upon our arrival that we were seated immediately and the table was sprinkled with Heart confetti with a personalized note wishing us a happy anniversary, nice extra touch.   We ordered the following :  - PROSCIUTTO WRAPPED MOZZARELLA - This was AMAZING!! - PARMESAN TRUFFLE FRIES - We did not care for these at all. Wish I would have gone with another potato side. - SOY GLAZED BRUSSELS SPROUTS WITH BACON- My husband was reluctant to try Brussel Sprouts but they were delicious and he liked them! - PORCINI RUBBED BONE-IN RIBEYE WITH 15-YEAR AGED BALSAMIC - I ordered this and it was so flavorful and tender, I loved it!!! - BONE IN FILET MIGNON - This was one of the specials so my husband decided to try it. I must say that he was not impressed at all. I tasted the steak was and it was a bit dry and overall the taste was nothing to brag about, nothing special at all! - COCONUT CREAM PIE - WOW, What a way to finish our meal! This was to die for! A soft dump cake like crust filled with yummy coconut cream then topped with whipped cream, drizzled with some type of rum sauce then finished with a thin crispy sugar cookie!  Aside from the nice note at the beginning, the service was NOT \"as gracious as it is attentive\" as stated on their website. Our waiter was subpar, he rattled off the specials and suggested items like it was the thousandth time he had done so that day!  He seemed to be attending to several tables but I could help but notice that he was paying more attention to those tables as they were ordering alcoholic drinks were as my husband and I did not. We had to ask another waiter for steak knives when our food arrived. Too bad because even with the few food items we were not impressed with I would have given them a 4 star but I just could not because of the substaservice."}
{"text":"What a great dining experience!  We had a group of 8 which can be tricky but Mike did an excellent job taking care of us. The food and drinks were top notch. We had a great time and we shut the place down. We love the CG in Plano, TX so we were glad this location was equally great."}
{"text":"I am very hard to please. This place did not disappoint. We sat at the bar. They were on point. Drinks were never empty , and the food was great."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Capital Grille at least once a month. I can easily say this is the best restaurant in Charlotte. The food and the service here are unquestionable and once you become a regular the service becomes even more personal.  There are a lot of competitors with this price range and same products in uptown, but when you want fine dining, friendly and courteous service along with a GREAT wine list this is the place to come!"}
{"text":"We were in from out of town and Pittsburgh's Light Up festivities were going on, so let me start by saying it was very busy.  Capital Grille was one of the only restaurants that did not have over an hour wait.  We were seated quick enough, the waitress, who was working on 13 hours was very pleasant.  Unfortunately it took an hour for us to get our main course.  This was also at 9:30 at night.  My wife ordered a filet well done, it was (at best) medium rare.  I ordered mine rare, which it was,  but the entire outside was charred and tasted it.  They took them back, and I'm pretty sure microwaved my wife's to well done and made a new steak for me.  My wife was satisfied with hers, but mine still lacked any flavor, and for a $50 dry aged strip steak, I couldn't believe it.    I am NOT a steak snob by any means, but I've had better steak from Kroger seasoned with just a little salt and pepper.     I will say though that the waitress was amazing, the manager was very apologetic and kind as well.  They ended up comping the entire meal and gave us a desert as well, but we left hungry.  Again, they seemed to be having problems this night altogether.  I can only assume they had a new chef/cooking staff."}
{"text":"A steakhouse worth the price. Downtown Charlotte there is a steak waiting cooked to perfection with your name on it. After driving 4 hours I finally decided to stop for a bite to eat. Once I walked in I knew I was under dressed everyone I the place was in their Sunday finest , never the less I sat down and ordered a nice juicy steak it was out of this world! I also tried the lobster and shrimp cocktails all worth the price. $230.00 later no regrets you will defiantly remember this place for years to come."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and excellent service. Very pricey but worth every penny. We had the fried mozzarella paired with a Sauvignon Blanc. Wine was suggested by our server Shirley. She was spot on! We ordered Oscar Filet. I don't remember having a steak with so much flavor. 10 oz. of filet with back fin lump crabmeat and asparagus. Excellent!"}
{"text":"I love this place, only because it has great streak but because they serve Fresca!  It's next to impossible to find and they actually have it.  I love Fresca and Citrine vodka so it's nice to have a cocktail before dinner.  The sides are huge which is good because everything is a la carte (the only downside)."}
{"text":"Every meal at Capital Grill has been wonderful. And I say that even after having to send food back two out of three occasions. Have had a steak and a burger delivered to the table overcooked on consecutive dines. Now, that's not great, but the service staff go above and beyond in taking care of the situation. Meat can get overcooked, it happens, but how the waiters deal with the situation can make all the difference. In both instances my food was replaced very quickly with perfect and tasty results.  Overall, there has not been anything we've ordered that wasn't fantastic. The food is pricey, but I think worth it. The steaks (when cooked to the proper temperature) are phenomenal. And the sides like lobster mac and cheese and creamed spinach are what dreams are made of.  I take one star away because it seems like someone in the kitchen isn't always paying attention. But I will be back as many times as my wallet will allow."}
{"text":"We started off our One year Anniversary at Bella Vista on Mt. Washington. Only to end up leaving after a nightmare situation. We aren't from Pittsburgh but I heard about Capital Grille from clients so we left and headed straight there. They saved our night! We were able to be seated immediately on a Friday night without reservations and our service and experience was beyond perfection. Our waiter Christopher was already going above and beyond before even finding out about our nightmare experience just minutes prior and then once he found out it was our One year anniversary he created a memorable experience for us. He did not hold back. He wanted to save our night and he did in a big way. I'm truly grateful for his service and everyone else that helped serve us in anyway that night! The food was delicious and the cheesecake was the best I've ever had! Thank you Christopher & Capital Grille"}
{"text":"We had an absolutely amazing experience at our dinner here. We arrived thirty minutes early and were seated right away. They had what was basically an all you can drink wine for $28 with six types to choose from. It was a great deal (and no one kept track if we had eight pours or more)   They had a gluten free menu and our server Ryan talked me through all the options. He also helped with the specials if I could have them or not.   Most of us had the dry aged New York strip which was moist and flavorful with absolutely no seasonings, it didn't need any! The asparagus was well cooked and the mashed potatoes were super creamy. Decadent and gluten free! They also have gluten free flourless chocolate cake, which was pretty good. I had to scrape off the excess coco powder.   It was my friends birthday and they gave her a cheesecake and a flourless cake, which she accidentally spilled water on and they replaced. So nice!   Our server Ryan kept refilling our wine even after we paid and the service was impeccable all through the evening. When you go ask to sit in Ryan's section!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get filet Mignon! The porcini rub is to die for. And if you haven't had a stoli doli, you're missing out! Go easy though. The lobster Mac is another one of my faves. I don't think I've ever had anything here I don't like."}
{"text":"Do you valet more often than not? Do people ever call you \"narcissistic\" or \"pretentious\"? Do you go at lengths to be sure people know that you are the wealthier than they are? If you answered yes to any of those questions, Capital Grill is where you should eat lunch tomorrow.   The wait staff is friendly and they all have exotic accents, but you can tell their jobs aren't easy. \"I said pink in the middle! Not charred, not red. Pink, you imbecile! I knew we should've brunched at the country club, dear.\"   Food is good for those who can flip the bill but not nearly good enough to charge what they do."}
{"text":"We had a great night here with out-of-town friends...this was going to be one of many stops on our night out but, once we sat in the beautiful bar area, we ended up staying three hours with our great server, Marc.  The Capital Grille has always been our favorite \"chain\" steakhouse and the location on Tryon Street is lovely!!  The four of us shared an impressive seafood tower, bone-in ribeye, creamed spinach, truffle fries, and creamed corn.  Marc made a great wine selection.  The whole experience was five star and I recommend any of the dishes we ordered!  This location offers outdoor tables on the very active Tryon Street...great for people-watching on warmer nights."}
{"text":"Not impressed. They need to remodel and decrease the number of staff they have \"running\" around as it doesn't create a nice atmosphere especially for the price. Food was a bit above average."}
{"text":"Had a New Years Eve dinner with my girlfriend last night and we had an excellent dinner. Started off with the lobster/crab cake and it was very delicious, definitely would get again.  For the main course I had the Filet Mignon which was delicious as well, but not the best steak I have ever had.  Our side dishes were the mac and cheese (phenomenal!), creamed spinach (excellent!), and potatoes au gratin (Sensational!)  After the meal we were so full we skipped dessert.  The decor is nice inside.  A little stuffy, but nice.  We had an 8:30pm reservation and when they called to confirm the registration they said it was 8pm (I know for sure it was set for 8:30pm).  The caller seemed a little surprised/annoyed to hear of the mistake, but stated she would make sure it worked at 8:30pm.  When we arrived at 8:30pm they had us wait until about 8:45pm.  Not really a big deal though.  Overall, I definitely recommend The Capital Grille!"}
{"text":"Old school steaks, manly interiors accompied with some of the best table side service you'll see in Charlotte.  That's what keeps me coming back to Capital Grille.  Aside from Beef and Bottle on South Blvd., Capital Grille is one of the first upscale steak places that Charlotte had.  It's been here longer than Mortons, Ruth Chris or Palm, etc.  So in some ways I feel like the other's are just riding coat tails in Charlotte.  Of course, it is a chain so with that being said I'm sure this isn't the original one.  The filet oscar and lobster mac 'n cheese are simply put \"my last meal on earth\".  Through in a nice red glass of vino to wash it down and that equals instant smile for this guy!"}
{"text":"Damn good steak! what else is there to say. If you're a steak lover and haven't been to the CG then you're missing out. Yes I know its a chain, but if the food is good then what difference does it make."}
{"text":"I went here for a special occasion and was a bit concerned because there were one or two that said it was not good.  I have to tell you it was one of the best experiences I have had in my life.  The food was absolutely AMAZING.  The staff was wonderful.  Our waiter Daniel was out of this world.  He was there for our every need without being overbearing.  Courses came out in a timely manner with time to relax and enjoy without going hungry, but also not being rushed.  I can not imagine a better experience for dinning.  It is well worth the high price.  If you want cheap, go to Denny's or Olive Garden and you will be fine.  If you want true excellence, this is the choice for you."}
{"text":"My $0.02  Steakhouses are a dime a dozen in Vegas.  But you already know that.  Seems like there's one on every corner waiting for you to cough up $50+ a pop.  There isn't much to set this place apart from the rest besides the nationally-recognized name (nothing against chains, but I'm just making a point).    The beef here is pretty consistent.  (It never ceases to amaze me at how many times I've had overcooked steak).  I always order the rib eye and on two separate visits, both times med rare was med rare.  Win!  I also tried a friend's kona coffee rubbed rib eye: yet another example of why you should never pay extra to put crap that ruins/asks the flavor of a good slab of beef.  On my latest trip we had creamed spinach, mushrooms and the lobster mac & cheese.  Creamed spinach was tasty, mushrooms were acceptable, but the mac and cheese was winners!  Next time, I think we'll just have three orders of that.  Aside from the mac and cheese, the one thing that really stood out was the pineapple infused vodka.  Well slap me silly and call me Susan; this stuff is B-O-M-B.  For this drink alone, it is worth at least hitting up the bar.  Also, they have an ok corkage policy.  I think it was $35/bottle, with a two bottle max.  All in all, though, a martini and a side dish aren't enough to really warrant handing over a wad of my cash for a middle of the road steakhouse.  Sure, it's better than Outback, but with competition right across the street, this place has room for improvement.  Just my humble opinion."}
{"text":"I am a big fan, and frequent visitor to Capital Grille. I had a bad experience during my last visit. Both my partner and I got sick (stomach) after the visit. Not expected from Capital Grille but unfortunately this happened. What made it even more frustrating was that I contacted company but did not get any response back."}
{"text":"Food is awesome, service is great. The rib eye and lamb is yummy for my tummy! Creamed spinach and mushrooms.... Yeah killer joint!"}
{"text":"Fine dining at its finest. We always have the best anniversary dinners here! The table is adorned with heart shaped confetti, a card and a rose and makes the celebratory dining experience even more memorable. The crab cakes are to die for. I've never had crab cakes as delicious as these, and believe me I've tried/searched. But they are second to none. Next the au gratin potatoes-- the mix of cheeses is mouthwatering and it is browned to perfection. Other favs are the lobster mac and cheese, the twice baked potatoes ( which is no longer offered), and the brussel sprouts. You really cannot go wrong with any item on the menu. As many times as we have dines her for our anniversary or just a regular date night, we have never ever ever been disappointed. Worth every penny. The staff there makes you feel welcomes and special and give you the five star treatment! Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 12, so it could have easily been extremely chaotic. We had a delightful experience!   I ordered the bone-in ribeye, which was huge and so succulent. For the table, we ordered spinach, lobster mac and cheese, truffle fries, and mushrooms to share. So amazing! I really recommend the truffle fries and lobster mac.   Overall, zero complaints! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Disappointing evening.  The Capital Grille has always been our go-to place for special events and whenever we can escape from the kids.  Last night was a special night for us and a couple that we went with.  Food was on point, no complaints. Steaks perfect, salads perfect, sides perfect.   Where they fell short was in the wait staff.    Usually we get the same waitress, or someone we know like Margie, we should have asked for her, our bad.   We got someone else this time, I will not publicly say who it was , we aired our grievances last night with the manager and I hope they do something about it, like additional training.  This in no way will deter us from not coming back, however we will consider one of the other 4 steak joints in Pittsburgh first.  Hyde Park, Ruth Chris, Eddie Merlot, Mortons."}
{"text":"Hubby made reservations and told them the special occasion, my birthday! We were seated immediately to a table that was near the window and nicely decorated with confetti, candy & a card (see pics).  Server was nice and informative. We started with drinks I think it was a pineapple martini, it was ok, we're not big drinkers so the alcohol was strong and we only had one that we could barely finish lol  -appetizer hubby got a spinach salad which he liked, and I got the lobster bisque which with each spoonful I died and went to lobster heaven! Lots of sweet chunks of lobster and the soup itself was creamy but light, I would've been happy just having that dish. -we got out entree I forgot the names but I think hubby got the ribeye and I got a surf & turf. Sides were mashed potato & asparagus. Steaks were awesome, sides were meh, we didn't finish the potatoes. -for my bday they brought out a sampler with writing (see pics) it was delish. The chocolate cake was very rich so it would be good to share and cheesecake was perfect.  All in all, service was great! Also for u \"winos\" we noticed that if u asked for the wine list they have an expert wine guy come to your table and explain everything u need to know (maybe too much lol). I'd say fairly priced for the quality of food and service you're gonna get."}
{"text":"Perfectly executed, from the wine to hollandaise to steak. I highly reccomend."}
{"text":"I like this place. My work goes out once in a while for a special occasion and we chose here. Last time we had a waitress who was really obnoxious though. She was clearing plates as we were still eating off them, etc.  They have a great Cesar salad though and the bread basket is a little different and yummy! Not cheap though if you do it right!"}
{"text":"Yes, it's technically a national chain restaurant, owned by the likes of the same folks who do Longhorn and its ilk.  But when you're on corporate account and/or just need to impress your lunch or dinner companions, it is very hard to go wrong here both in the wine and food departments.  And the jacketed dinner service?  Well, I always feel extremely well taken care of here.    Aside from one of the best looking bars in all of uptown, the space is amazing, with a partially open kitchen with adjacent wine room and plenty of dark wood and rich, dense carpet.  It very much has that \"country club\" look and feel to it.    That ambiance easily carries over to the menu, which is small but that just belies how big the typical portions are.  The same should be said for the calorie count of most offerings.  Friends, leave the diet at the door and prepare to splurge, it's just about impossible not to.  From the decadent lobster bisque soup to the crunchy, earthy goodness of truffled french fries, you simply can't stay within a reasonable calorie count for a proper meal here.  So just forget it, and enjoy.  Standouts for me include the calamari, served with peppers which are not too hot but add a perfect tang to the rich savoriness of the batter than surrounds the actual rings and other bits of delicious seafood.  This could be a meal unto itself, yet it's just their most popular starter.    Steaks do reign on the entree menu, and I recommend going with the options which include the large chunks of fresh crab meat on top.  Why not take good to great?  But I am currently obsessing over the seared tuna with tri-dipping sauces and gingered rice.  Maybe it's the wasabi oil alone, with the palette cleansing bite that comes with every taste?  Whatever it is, I call it insane and it's a struggle not to order it again and again.  But you mustn't stop there, as dessert is just as over the top as everything else in the meal.  Mile-high cheesecake, a decadent chocolate layer cake, creme burulee, and more seasonal offerings.  One is typically plenty to share, or try a few and let the staff box it up for take-home enjoyment afterward.  The staff really cater to your special birthday and anniversary events, so long as you let them know ahead of time, so do share that at the time of reservation.  During late summer, they also have a wine event called The Generous Pour.  It's a fantastic deal that I highly recommend- wine all night long for a very reasonable beverage surcharge.    So, chain or not, this place is great for putting on the swag and showing your guests or yourself a fancy meal out.  Something of a Charlotte staple now, these guys are setting a standard."}
{"text":"As Las Vegas locals it's rare for us to eat on the strip. This is a stop we will make again.  Getting through Fashion Show to find the entrance was a bit of an adventure, but worth the hassle. We made reservations and there was no delay in seating. The dinner service was a slower pace; the fact that this was a rare date night for my husband I was great, but the fact we had concert tickets afterwards not so much. The atmosphere very much had an old-school vegas/cigar lounge vibe, the wait staff was more mature rather than bubbly and bouncy 20-somethings creating a calm dining experience. I do wish, as it was obvious we were a solo-dining couple (on a date) to have been seated away from large groups as there were plenty available - we didn't ask to be reseated, in hindsight I would have appreciated a quieter meal with my husband.  My husband had a steak, I had fish, both were perfectly cooked. Food was served hot. No complaints.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! My favorite restaurant! Everything is just superb from the staff to the amazing food ! If you go you have to get the lobster Mac and cheese . It's to die for ( not that I want you to) The portions are shareable!  Recommend items EVERYTHING!! But no , seriously the lamb is beautifully butterflied and serviced with a in house jam purée(faaaavvvv)"}
{"text":"The Capital Grille is definitely a place to go for special occasions.  The service was superb.  The waitress was extremely knowledgeable about all menu items and wine pairings with menu items.  The bread basket was delicious, including some Passover friendly items.  I had the mozzarella, basil, tomato salad (let's just call it Caprese, though that isn't the official name on the menu).  The aged balsamic vinegar was delightful, as well as the basil.  The rest was ho-hum, but by no means bad.  Just average.  I partially blame myself for ordering a tomato based salad not during tomato growing season.  My mom and I split the lobster macaroni and cheese as well as the green beans.  Both were delicious and well executed, though my mom felt like the green beans were a little undercooked.  Dessert was the flourless chocolate espresso cake.  It was good, but didn't knock anyone's socks off.  What DID look amazing and tasted awesome was the Chocolate Hazelnut Cake.  It was also HUGE and would easily serve 3+ people.  Ambiance was wonderful with low lighting.  I could have used a few less dead animal heads around the place, but I get the vibe they're going for.  Wine list is expansive and also expensive, which gets to my next idea.  The place is very, very expensive.  You may notice we didn't get any steak, which the place is known for.  There is not a cut of meat available for under 40 bucks.  I get it, it's a fancy steak place.  Personally, I just couldn't muster spending that much for anything that is food. Call me cheap, but I call it smart."}
{"text":"Before a show at Wynn, I came here for dinner.  I was early but it was OK and I was seated at a window table with the marvelous third floor view of the boulevard and the Wynn/Encore towers.  I was brought bread, ice water, and iced tea quickly.  My server, Eric, was top notch!  He explained various things on the menu since it was my first visit to the restaurant.  He then left me to mull the choices before coming back to see if I had any questions or was ready to order.  I ordered a cup of potato leek soup, the bone in Kona crusted sirloin and the parmesan truffle fries for a side.  Everything was very, very good.  The potato leek soup was creamy and served with a few very thin, slightly deep fried fingerling potato slices.  The soup was rich and very enjoyable.  I ordered the steak blue and that's just the way it came.  It was very good and I almost picked up the bone to gnaw before I let them take the plate.  The parmesan truffle fries were addictive.  If anyone from the FDA comes to this restaurant, the fries will be listed as a Class xx addictive drug.  I hated to finish only a small amount but I didn't want to overdo it.  For dessert, I got the flourless chocolate espresso cake.  It was very rich and had a good dark chocolate/coffee flavor--strong but not overpowering.    I gave my compliments to Eric for the staff on such a good meal.  It was a great start to the evening.  The view through those windows along with the excellent food and service make the Capital Grille a real winner."}
{"text":"In the chaos of Las Vegas strip, the Capital Grill is an oasis of calm and sophistication in a sea of choices.  Decided as we came back from the Outlet mall we decided to jump off the bus for lunch.  Very nice and relaxing place with a dark inviting bar tucked away where you can have a relaxing drink or sit by a large window with panoramic view and have a great meal.  We had some wine and I got the rib eye steak sandwich.  It was cooked perfectly and ate the entire sandwich where the steak was trimmed perfectly.  A great place for lunch and sure an exceptional dinner."}
{"text":"WOW WOW WOW! Yelp and Capital Grille really went above and beyond today! All of the food was incredible and I can't wait to come back for more sliders and fries. The staff here is top-notch and those liberal wine pours made me jealous of all of the non-pregnant attendees. ;-) Thanks go to Lindsey once again.... Well done! (steakhouse pun intended)"}
{"text":"Sometimes you get what you pay for. I only recommend this place for most people if its a special occasion or trying to impress someone, this place is a four or five star restaurant-expensive be warned! It's so fancy that they have lockers for ppl who store and pay for their wine to be kept there. I had a birthday dinner here and they definitely made it special-had table decorated, brought a birthday candle/dessert/gave me a card/wished me happy birthday-you name it! The service here was exceptional manager greets you, waiter and busser are attentive. The food was also very good. They have larger portions for a fancy restaurant. French onion soup is very large and good, bread bowl is varied and large, steaks are big portions and cooked to order and tender, truffle fries delicious, crab was good. I can't really complain about this place."}
{"text":"I've had better.   I expect many people to rate this place on expectations and not really relative quality because they feel that they are supposed to. I don't. So, for starters this place looks high class. The prices on the menu reflect that appearance too. I think it would be a challenge to get out a lunch under $25 and be full afterwards. I ordered a dry-aged sirloin steak ($24) and \"The wedge\" salad ($9). I had never had a dry-aged sirloin steak before, but according to the waiter it is supposed to have more flavor. Honestly, it just tasted like any other steak that I've had. I probably could have made a comparable steak after shopping at the local grocery store. Like really, all you do is cook it. But I digress. The salad was tasty but it was iceberg lettuce and the sauce was likely loaded with fat. Overall not a bad experience.  But I recommend the Ruth Chris Steak house instead of this place as they add a light sauce (with garlic butter) to their steak that really adds to the flavor. They also kiss your ass throughout the entire meal which makes you feel like a king. Hail!  Food Quality/Taste = 3 Stars Portion Size Given Price = 2 Stars Relative Price = 2 Stars Service = 4 Stars Experience with Staff = 4 Stars Decor = 5 Stars Clean (yes/no) = yes"}
{"text":"Pretty typical steakhouse experience. Personally I think Morton's is better.   The men in our group ordered the dry aged strip steak which they seemed very happy with. When I tasted one I didn't think it was outstandingly better than non-dry-aged steak. The flavor wasn't better or more tender IMHO.   My mom and I ordered fish: she citrus glazed salmon, me the tuna.   Sides we ordered were asparagus and green beans. Both pretty typical and not treated in any interesting ways.  I was told the tuna was sashimi grade and just seared. Little did I know this meant below room temperature in the center. I'm used to my ahi grilled rare/med-rare and I think it's better that way unless you're eating actual sushi.   If you're looking for a safe traditional steak house you'll be fine here.  Desserts were the best part of the meal. The flourless chocolate espresso cake was delicious. Husband approved of the creme brulee."}
{"text":"My husband and I jumped at the opportunity to dine here again after having the best steak of our lives at the Troy location in Michigan.  Our go-to is the Porcini Rubbed Delmonico with 12-Year Aged Balsamic.  The flavor wasn't as strong this time around, but the steak was cooked to PERFECTION and still excellent!  We also shared the Lobster Mac n Cheese and OH. MY. GOD.  It is heavenly!  The only thing that was mediocre was the lobster bisque, but I certainly don't come here for that.  I'm seriously day dreaming about the next time I can get my hands on another one of their steaks.  Yum!  Since we had such a heavy meal, we opted for sorbet for dessert.  It was extraordinarily delicious, not like the consistency of your average icy sorbet.  The mango (my fave) and raspberry sorbet was almost like ice cream, super creamy and loaded with flavor.  Our waitress told us they actually make the sorbet in house.  No wonder!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Absolutely a favorite of mine. I had the gorgonzola steak and it was amazing! Staff is so friendly and creates a wonderful experience. I highly recommend this place if you are going out for a nice meal!"}
{"text":"Any place that has lobster mac n cheese and does it correctly warms my heart. All the appetizers and soups I've had the chance to try(granted, only a few), were great, and that's definitely this place's strength.  Compared to a few other steak houses that I've tried in Vegas, it ranks about in the middle when it comes to the actual steak. However very very good steak houses are surprisingly somewhat rare in Vegas, so take it for what you will."}
{"text":"i ate here on 10-29-14 around 6:00 pm.  i made reservations but decided to eat in the bar.  the bar server was helpful and did a great job meeting my dining needs.  for dinner i ordered the demonico steak served au jus and enjoyed it thoroughly!  once the kitchen staff brought the steak out folks commented on how good the steak smelled!  not only did it smell good but also tasted great!  my side of parmesan truffle fries were good.  a little different but enjoyable.  for dessert i ordered a chocolate hazelnut cake.  i guess the bar server failed to mention this cake can serve about 4 people.  it was good and i tried to get my monies worth and kill the cake myself.  i failed but it tasted great!  i had a great experience at this las vegas location.  not my first rodeo at TCG.  my bill before tip was $80.  i would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Came here before an opera of which the waiter was aware. We were courteously rushed but this was okay because we needed to leave at a certain time. Service was quick except when I received the check. It took a little bit for the waiter to pick up the payment and process it. The coffee was served with some spilled on the cup plate."}
{"text":"This restaurant is great every time I come. The food is absolutely delicious. From appetizers, sides, main dishes, dessert, everything is always amazing! For appetizers we ordered the seafood platter and it came with oysters, shrimp, lobster, and shredded crab. The seafood is fresh and the shrimps are huge! My favorite side dish that is an absolute must is the mac and cheese lobster, it's the best! For dinner I ordered a filet mignon, the steaks here are flavor-able and always cooked perfectly. Last, but not least dessert, I ordered the coconut cream pie and it's my go to every time. It's so good I never like sharing haha! The service is great as well, they always are on top of everything. Capital Grille is definitely a must it if you're up for some delicious food!"}
{"text":"I have been to this capitol grille and others in different states...they are really great for a small chain. The food is great and so is the service. The wine list has great wine by the glass and 1/2 bottles :)   This is a must visit"}
{"text":"Daryl Walter was no question the best person we have come in contact here, we have been repeat customers a couple times and will continue to be repeats here. I do not drink and he recommended a bourbon blackberry drink that was AMAZINGLY spot-on!!!! His recommendation for my wife was flawless!!! She was super happy with her 22oz steak lol. She weighs 100lb. He was extremely commodating and offered educating decisions. I hope he is able to be recognized for supporting such appreciated customers. Til next time Daryl!!!!"}
{"text":"We had a very large group and the Capital Grille accommodated us superbly! Members of our party had to leave dinner at varying intervals because of different departing flight times. Despite this, our waiter, Jeff Spivey, gave us all excellent service and doggy bags for those who needed to catch their flights. One nice touch worth mentioning besides the high-quality food and service is that they gave us spearmint-smelling warm washcloths for us to use to wash our hands after dinner and before dessert. During the meal, everyone kept complimenting the restaurant and the dinner experience we were enjoying. We had a wonderful time."}
{"text":"Fantastic, had a change of plans and ended up coming here. Wasn't wanting to but so glad we did. Good was absolutely delicious. They accommodated 30 of us and there was no lack in service at all. Nothing that was ordered was bad, everyone very impressed and happy,"}
{"text":"A perfect birthday dinner. My wife was presented with two lovely roses in a small vase. Our server, Candice could not have been nicer. Our steaks were done perfectly, medium rare. A happy birthday dessert plate finished the evening. Bravo Capital Grille..."}
{"text":"Excellent for business lunch, dinner, wine and services.  Great wine selection, salads and much more.  I always ask for George. Food is tops!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars and rounding up to 5; quite a feat given that within a 1-mile radius, you have Ruth's Chris, Fleming's, Morton's, McCormick and Schmick's -- not to mention Chima and BLT Steakhouse (we have been to all of these either in Charlotte or somewhere else around the world).  I have to say that out of all the restaurants in Charlotte (in the short 5 months that I've lived here), Capital Grille (\"CG\") is my favorite because it: (1) has an idyllic ambience; (2) has stellar service; (3) has delicious food; and (4) is consistent in its delivery.  Fun fact: I'm sure all you Charlotteons know this but CG is featured in Shallow Hal and still looks exactly the same.  Worldwide consistency.  We have been to CG in Orange County, Chicago, Mexico City -- to name a few -- and every time, every experience is the same, from the restaurant decor to the service to the food, whether you're dining indoors, on a patio, or lunch or for dinner, on a week day/night or weekend.  When we go to CG anywhere, anytime, including this Charlotte location, I know exactly what to expect and they deliver on point every time, without exception.  Idyllic ambience.  There is something comforting about feeling like you're coming back to the same restaurant even though you're in a different city.  CG is old school traditional, like a cigar or country club, with its dark woods, white linen tables, and all-male waitstaff.  They are literally frozen in time; they know what works and have stuck with it adamantly.  Their tables are set far enough apart, the ceiling heights and rooms are sufficiently insulated as to promote an aura of privacy to enhance your dining experience, regardless of how busy they are (esp on Friday or Saturday nights).  I personally prefer to sit on their patio, which does take in some of the city noise (especially cars that rumble by, blaring their speakers) but it is lushly landscaped and tucked back enough from the street that it feels like a serene reprieve from the bustle of the city.  Outstanding service.  The service is impeccable every time.  They seamlessly refill your drinks, serve various courses, remove plates and silverware with timed efficiency so that you have what you need, when you need it and whatever you don't want is gone in a flash.  The staff works in unison in teams and they do it in the least obtrusive way possible as to enhance your dining experience.  Delectable food.  In 5 months in Charlotte alone, we've been to CG Charlotte 5 times and have never been served anything that was less than delicious.  When we're in the mood for steak and seafood, this is our go-to place and like the restaurant, we stick to what we know works.   +++++Complimentary breads.  The array of fresh warm breads is splendid; the breads are moist, soft on the inside and crispy on the outside.  The butter is absolutely wonderful.  You can ask for the specific bread that you want (I prefer the dark bread, my BF prefers the sourdough). +++++Cocktail shrimp.  These jumbo-sized shrimp are fresh and succulent; the cocktail sauce has just the right amount of kick to it and is very flavorful. +++++Oysters.  These were my favorite oysters in Charlotte until I discovered the heavenly ones at Baku (review to follow shortly) but in their own right, they are marvelous.  They aren't overly briny, they are always fresh (see my review and corresponding warning of Pearlz Oyster Bar) and are always absolutely marvelous. +++++Caesar salad.  The Caesar salad is perfect: every piece of lettuce is crisp and fresh; the croutons are crispy and garlicky; and the dressing is divine with its thick creaminess, with just a hint of lemon, garlic and anchovy. +++++Lobster bisque.  The bisque is heavenly; the lobster is sweet and fresh, the broth is creamy, buttery, semi-sweet incorporating  the right blend of saltiness. +++++Lobster salad.  This salad is divine; the lobster is fresh and sweet but the star is the citrus vinaigrette that really enhances the lobster flavor with just the right balance of tart and semi-sweet. +++++Lobster Mac and cheese.  The lobster Mac and cheese is very cheesy, so much so that when you pull it on your fork, the cheese kind of glides onto your fork into your mouth.  You have to eat this pretty fast or it dries up and you lose the ooze effect. +++++Mashed potatoes.  These potatoes are garlicky, nicely salted with the perfect blend of creaminess; they're densely fluffy -- oxymoron, I know, but that's what they are. +++++Rib eye.  The rib eye is tender, moist, juicy and cooked to your preference (we like medium rare).  They do have A1 sauce but they definitely don't drown out the natural beef flavor with anything else. +++++creme brûlée.  The creme brûlée is not overly decadent; it is vanilla flavored, the custard is thick but not overpowering or decadent in its sweetness.    Overall, if you're looking for a solid semi-casual traditional steakhouse restaurant, I highly recommend Capital Grille, especially on their outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Great dinner last night at The Capital Grill.  I can see why they have over 4 stars as an average.  The bone-in Rib Eye was fantastic!  Service was superb and we had the perfect window table overlooking the Strip.  I will definitely come back to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"WTFH Capital Grille?  It's been a while since I've been here, and every time I had been before was pretty much 5 stars.  However, last night I came here for a friend's birthday... and it was just a parade of horribles.    First thing, we had a reservation at 8:45, and we did not get seated until 9:30.  Considering our reservation was late, we were pretty hungry.  So waiting an extra 45 min., not exactly the most pleasant experience.  However, we got bread at the bar, which held us up.  To make up for that, they gave us two apps, which was quite thoughtful.  We had the calamari and prosciutto wrapped mozzarella.  Both were great!  We ordered a bottle of wine, a tempranillo from Spain as I recall, and that was excellent as well.  Then we ordered our entrees.  I got the filet with the kona rub, my friend got the crab cakes and lobster as her entree, and my other friend got the delmonico with the kona rub.    In a timely fashion, they brought my friend's crab cakes out and told us our steaks would be out very soon.  However, they didn't come out until 30 min or so after our friend was served.  But even before the steaks came out, the manager came over to apologize, and to say that they had accidentally burned our steaks and threw them out and they would be on the house.  We thought that was very nice and thoughtful, but we were thinking OK, what else is going to happen...   So we get our steaks, and mine is cooked to perfection.  My other friend's looks fine, but a little charred on the outside.  The waitress said it was because of the kona rub.  Nonetheless, after a few bites of his, he tried mine.  The waitress then came back and asked how the steaks were, and he said that his was burnt.  I really didn't believe it, so I tried it.  And wow, I had to spit it out it was THAT bad.    The waitress, flustered with us at that point offers to make him another and we decline.  I felt bad for her, she seemed to not be having the best night because it was so busy.  And we even said, we know it's not you, don't worry about it, and she replied, we're always busy and your experience should always be excellent here (or something along those lines).    Next, we ordered some creme brulee and some cappuccinos.  Our waitress brought out the cappuccinos and the creme brulee.  I sipped my cappuccino, and what do you know, it was COLD!  My other friend's was cold too.   We asked to speak to the manager, because we just couldn't believe this had happened.  We told him about the steak, and he said, \"and that's why we comped your whole meal.\"   However, we also told him about the cappuccinos as well, and he seemed a bit shocked, but said \"thank you for telling me.\"  He then seemed almost annoyed, and walked away.    All we wanted was a top notch dining experience in Pittsburgh for my friend's birthday, something you expect from Capital Grille.  However, we definitely did not receive one.  And even though our meal was comped, it was still a very disheartening night out and simply not worth it.  Sadly, I don't think I'll be coming back here."}
{"text":"I suppose that this is one of those restaurants who treat their regulars well and don't give a sh*t about new clients. It was Mother's Day when we went and I understand, things get pretty hectic on a holiday. First, our server Michael always seemed to be in a rush, flitting in and out like a damn butterfly but not really paying much attention to our table -- kind of  a forced and bored indifferent attitude, moving and walking fast to give the impression he can't be bothered. Then we order two 50$ plates of steak and they can't even get it right. It's either they cooked it wrong or they just swapped the orders. We didn't even bother. At that point, we'd been in the restaurant for 1.5 hours, and that had been 30 minutes after finishing the appetizers and salads and soups. It was just ridiculous. If I'm paying $300 for a meal for 4 people, I expect the service to be top-notch, the food something to write home about. There's simply no margin for error at this price point! The scallops were too salty, the steaks not properly cooked, the salmon just alright. The manager did take one of the plates off our bill and Mr. Michael (note the sarcasm) gave us a voucher for one calamari. But let me tell you something, I do not want to go to a place where service and food quality are probabilistic, when there's a chance it can be very good or very bad. I don't think a plate of calamari makes up for a ruined experience. I don't think I'll ever go back to this place again, there are just too many other options.   We'd been to A Different Pointe of View, Elements, and all those fancy restaurants. You're better off going to one of those places if you're willing to pay hundreds of dollars for a meal.   I understand I do not have much reviews here in Yelp which tells you how strongly I feel about my experience in this place. If they dare dispute this review, I will contact Yelp myself and send them a copy of the receipt."}
{"text":"Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! My husband and I went for our 8th anniversary. They made it really special for us.  Decorated the table with a card and everything.  The waiter was fabulous! Andy Rangel was outstanding with his recommendations and his serving skills.  Everything was absolutely perfect! The food was out of this world! I had the lobster tail and wow! The sweetest I have ever tasted! Andy also recommended the grapefruit soda which was wonderful and made us feel special. My husband and I are non drinkers. He also served a mind blowing dessert and wonderful non alcoholic sparking cider in champagne glasses! I will definitely be a regular here.  The Capital grill is top notch!"}
{"text":"On point.  From the hostess, to the waiter, to the rest of the wait staff, to the décor, to the food and the wine, this place was on point.  You can't go wrong with a bottle of merlot, oysters on the half shell, a porterhouse, a filet mignon, lobster mac & cheese and roasted mushrooms, followed by berries with fresh cream, a cappuccino and a sambuca.    On point and all aces."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for.  This aint no 99 cent hot dog joint that you would find on the strip or downtown.  The Capital Grille is definitely up there with Morton's and Ruth's.  The service was excellent and the steaks were even better.  They also offer fish, crab and lobster usually at market price.  You can bring a group of friends or enjoy a night out with someone you just met on the strip."}
{"text":"Myself and my wife are regulars for a reason. We have yet to be disappointed with both the quality of the service and food.  Their food is only eclipsed by their staff. They have some of the best in Charlotte. We are almost always greeted by name when we walk in, and our favorite waiter George knows our order before we do. Their lunch prices are great. A bone in dry aged steak cooked to perfection in the 20$ range is well worth twice as much.   Definitely go for a great lunch or dinner. Ask for George if he is available. You go in a customer and leave a friend with an incredible meal."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! Everything from the food, drinks, great service, and the view is excellent. Highly recommend, try it!"}
{"text":"Went to celebrate my boyfriends promotion and just by making a small comment with my reservation, they made our night so special! And beyond that, the food was spectacular. He had the surf and turf while I had the lamb chops with the lobster Mac and cheese to share. We had nothing but raving reviews and although very pricey, it's a great place for a special and romantic night."}
{"text":"First time here. I sat at the bar. Bartender was nice and friendly. Had a late night dinner. The tar tar filled me up and also got the kona crusted steak as main course. The food and ambiance was good. Didn't really spend much but side items are el la carte. I maybe back for a fancy dinner.  3 stars bc it was not busy. Will come back and re rate.   Pro Tip: the apps are big portions."}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner! Service was excellent and the food was great. I had the Dry Aged Steak au Poivre with Courvoisier Cream Sauce...one of the most fantastic steaks I've had. The hubby had the porterhouse steak and it was equally as visually appealing and tasty. We shared the Asparagus with Hollandaise Sauce and Sam's Mashed Potatoes; both fantastic."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!!!    This place is great!!   Went here last Saturday with a group of four and things couldn't have been better.    From the time we stepped into the restaurant to the time we stepped out we were treated like royalty.    Excellent, attentive service.   Two of us were even given a personal tour of the restaurant by the general manager.    Food items ordered included:  french onion soup, spinach salad, chopped salad, Delmonico steak, porterhouse steak, Filet Mignon, mashed potatoes, scalloped potatoes, green beans, chilled seared sushi grade tuna,  coconut cream pie.  We also had several bottles of wine the best of which was named \"The Boxer.\"   The bread basket they provide is also great.  All food items prepared correctly for everyone the first time.   The restaurant does have the feel of a gentleman's club and is expensive.    Give this Capital Grille location a try for your next special evening out."}
{"text":"We dined here againg during the recent restaurant week offering.   We basically ordered everything stated in my past review.   However, the portions this time were definitely smaller than the previous visit.   Still good though.    My steak was undercooked and had to send it back.   The server was polite and overall the food was good.   I ordered a margarita for my cocktail and it was fantastic.   This place is just very expensive so, in my opinion, should be reserved for a special occasion."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night to celebrate a friend's birthday.  We called in to make a reservation for a table of 14.  They were able to accommodate our party for the time we wanted even though we called 3 hours before.    Decor looks fancy here, and like most steakhouses the lights are usually dim.  First step through the doors and we were immediately greeted then seated even when our whole party was not there.    We took our time and finally decided to order.   I ordered the:  - Lobster Bisque (Was light in flavor, buttery taste and lightly sweet)  - Porcini Rubbed Delmonico with 12-year aged Balsamic (so juicy and flavorful with a light taste of balsamic reduction) Shared:  - Pan Fried Calamari with hot cherry peppers ( so good, but kinda spicy when you eat the chili)  - Lobster Mac n Cheese (bite size lobster bits, creamy mac'n goodness with a crunchy top)  - creamed corn with bacon   Since it was my friend's birthday, they gave him a huge slice of chocolate cake and also added three desserts for the table to share.  They let us tried the creme brulee which was so sinfully good, the cheesecake was delicious, and a chocolate cake.  Free dessert made it even sweeter.  A fantastic first time experience."}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to dine at the new Capital Grille before they opened to the public. Surprisingly, we were able to pull right into a parking spot right out front; they also offer valet for those not so lucky. We sat at the bar, where they present the drink menu on individual I pads-brilliant! After ordering, \"bar chips\" were put out for us, which were just okay...we opted to dive into the bread basket instead, which itself could be a separate course with 4 equally addicting kinds of bread!  First out was the french onion soup, which was a perfect portion for one. This is some of the best french onion soup I've had, as it wasn't overly rich. I ate the whole cup...which I did not regret because we waited at least another half hour before our steaks came out.  Next up was the star of the show- the steak. Now let me begin by stating I'm a steak snob. I will not order steak at any restaurant unless I know it's worth eating. Well, I'm happy to say I immediately approved after the first bite. We ordered a bone in filet, which was melt in your mouth goodness. The kona crusted NY strip was perfectly seasoned and big enough for 2. The butter had almost a mushroom flavor and was very tasty- I ordered it on the side and used it sparingly, as I never find the need to cover up flavor of quality beef when it's that good.  For sides, we went with the lobster mac&cheese....and the creamed corn, which we got talked into. The corn was okay, but the lobster mac&cheese we did not regret at all. It's more of a creamy mac than cheesy, but had large pieces of lobster. The lobster was obviously very fresh, and almost as good as the lobster we just had on a recent trip to Maine. Sides are big enough for 2 or 3, but if you have a party of 4, I'd recommend ordering at least 2 sides.  Last, but not least, was dessert. By default, we were served the coconut cream pie, which we would never order voluntarily. However, it was so incredibly delicious, we devoured it pretty quickly. The crust was amazing, almost like a gooey buttery sugar cookie right out of the oven.   Service was 4/5 stars, as well; the server who presented our steaks switched them up (even after asking them which was which), and it seemed like we waited much too long for them to come out after we finished our soup. Our steaks were slightly overcooked, but this was easily made up sending out shrimp cocktail, which was so fresh, it smelled like it came straight from the ocean- highly recommended.   All in all, I would come back if I was in the mood for steak. AND I would recommend it to others if they are in the area and looking for a good steak in a great atmosphere. Now that's sayin' something!"}
{"text":"The Capital Grille   Guess what Yeeps? I got some things to say. We dined here for dinner, celebrating a special day.  Why is the day special? The details in a bit. I want to review this place first. It's was good, it's legit.  We kept our dinner intimate, Keeping it small is the key. With only close friends, and the future Mrs. C.   From calling in our resos, to being seated. The overall service is the best. It's the best, I'll repeat it.   They had our table ready, with hearts and a greeting. I recommend this restaurant, to dine and a meeting.    We had bread, salads, steaks, and fish. I loved everything I ate, I finished my dish.   The steak is quality, and melts like butter. The salmon's packed with flavor, and like no other.  Back to the team, They deserve the praise. Mike took good care of us. Please give him a raise.   I recommend this restaurant, and that's on the real. We were served great food, at the Capital Grille.   I don't have much else to say, I don't have a lot. Wondering about our special day? We are tying the knot."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner and couldn't have been more thrilled! Two words- STOLI DOLI. Our server, Rob, was amazing and couldn't have been more helpful with explaining the menu. Ordered the filet mignon and although it was a little more rare than I would have preferred, it still melted in my mouth and was overshadowed by the fact the lobster mac n cheese (minus the lobster) was perfection. One side was suitable enough for my husband and I, we ended up bringing the rest home for the most expensive leftovers we've ever had. Definitely make it a point to come here for any special occasion!"}
{"text":"The Capital Grille NEVER disappoints! From Vegas to Pittsburgh- Exceptional service specially on such a busy night! From right when we walked to the minute we left! Always perfectly prepared food, lovey atmosphere, staff was on point, Our server Horcho was so professional and knowledgeable I can't say enough! Thank you so much for making our Christmas Eve dining experience unforgettable, always one of our favorite places to dine. (If not my number one favorite) Capital Grille you've done it again! Bravo!"}
{"text":"You fancy, huh?   The minute you step out of valet and get on the elevator to ascend to Capital Grille, you know you are going to be rolling out the benjis for dinner.  I really liked the atmosphere here.  Yeah, I know it's a chain, but this was my first time at CG, and I am not so cool that I cannot enjoy a well-done chain restaurant.  And this place is well done.  The bar area is nicely separated from the dining room and covered in dark wood paneling.  It looks like old money and you feel instantly classier sipping a dirty Grey Goose martini in the bar, which is exactly what we did.  After a drink, we were ready to be seated and start the feast.  The floor to ceiling windows ensure that the view is pretty great from any table in the room.  We started with oysters that were very fresh and salty.  5 stars.  We also brought a bottle of wine with us and the corkage fee of $25 was definitely lower than some other strip location restaurants.  Everything we had was wonderful but after that martini and a couple of glasses of wine, it gets a little fuzzy.  The only thing I can tell you for sure is the filet was great heated up for lunch the next day!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I loved everything I had here. I will admit that it is a pricey place to eat when on vacation. I wouldn't recommend going unless you are willing to spend at least $100 before tip. I had a full 3 course meal starting with an amazing display of seafood. I do recommend splitting the Grand seafood platter with friends I divided it between 4 of us and it was a good taster course for us all to start off with. The oysters and lobster were truly an religious experience for any seafood lover in the words of one of my friends \"they take you somewhere else.\" My steak was cooked perfectly and with just the right sauce to compliment it. They happened to be out of the bottle of wine we had ordered and they very kindly recommend a similar bottle and matched the price even though it was about $20 more expensive. Their cheesecake was absolutely the best I have ever had. It was fluffy and well balanced, just when you are really thinking of you can eat anymore they ask about dessert. I have to say I was really questioning weather I could in fact eat more but I just had a feeling it would be worth it.( I also split it with a friend)  The only let down in this entire experience, and I'm really begrudgingly admitting this, the soups we had ordered were good but unimpressive. The cup of lobster bisque had more of a dense cream flavor and texture then a true intense lobster flavor. The clam chowder my friend ordered had the exact same issue leading me to believe this is just go the make their soups."}
{"text":"This restaurant offers superior service and a delightful menu full of amazing steaks and seafood. The bar is a great way to hang out until your table is ready, so come a little early and enjoy a pre-dinner cocktail.  Between Morton's, Mastros (all of them), Durant's, etc... the area seems saturated with high end steak and seafood places. Capital Grille adds to this mix.  This is a dressy place, don't come in wearing flip flops and a T shirt...  Even if you are filthy rich.   I only have two slightly negative things to say about this restaurant. One is that they're very expensive. I would've given only 4 stars but this place has such great food that the quality is worth the money. The other is that the sides and desserts aren't very imaginative. Compared to Mastro's, I think the CG falls slightly behind.  Regardless, I've been here and will be back for sure"}
{"text":"The service was more awkward than attentive. My family and I were out for a very special occasion.  Which we made sure the server and restaurant knew about, nothing above and beyond or even \"special\" was done or offered.  (Except a little confetti on the table)  Things started with being handed a huge wine list on a tablet with no guidance - then no personal assist from the sommelier, just the server asking them a brief question for us.    Excessively seasoned (fire hot), appetizer.  Almost inedible for a few of us at the table.  I suspect the use of a complementary voucher to be the culprit for that.   Then being served the wrong steaks and having to switch them ourselves at the table.   Once the steaks were settled, they seemed very well prepared and were enjoyed.   Onward to addressing one of the party members by the wrong gender.  Apologizing of course, but still uncomfortable.   Another of our party ordered the pan seared tuna - it was the worst cut of tuna possible.  Stringy, difficult to bite and without being given a steak knife it was almost impossible to cut. (The meal was not sent back because of the occasion and not wanting to make a fuss)  We ended our meal with burnt coffee and what turned out to be delicious desserts.   The price, the occasion and the fact we went for dinner, not lunch, added up to the assumption that this would be a wonderful evening.  It turned out mostly mediocre.  I honestly have had a better time and better food, for a more reasonable price at local/neighborhood bars/resturaunts.  Do not fall for the hype. Try a small local fine dining restaurant.  You and your party will thank you for it!"}
{"text":"Stay Away! Went here for a late night dinner on Sunday and was not impressed.  Seems like a dining hall for the retirement community! Service was slow (not impressed with our server and expected higher level of service at such a place). Tuna tartare was disquisting. Literally - probably the worst item my wife and I ordered out in years.  Steak was mediocre, so was the salmon (very fishy) (served over canned beans!).    Presentation of food is BAD. Something you would expect out of a diner at 1/4 the price.   SUMMARY - very overpriced (VERY overpriced), gave us a stomachache and I will be surprised if I do not wake up with food poisoning in the morning.  We will NEVER return.  You have been warned!"}
{"text":"This was only my second Yelp Elite event. Once again, I have nothing but amazing things to say. Dining at the cozy Capital Grille on a sunny afternoon was just delightful. The food was delicious, the staff attentive, the lemonade was perfect! I love my little grab bag and box of truffle chocolate goodness. I brought my friend with me and she praised Yelp and Capital Grille up and down. I can't wait to go back and make use of my free drink coupon!"}
{"text":"Some say the first time is always the best and, in my case, I found that true. In between politicians kissing ass for my vote in DC, I went to my first Capital Grille just down from the Capital Building (no kidding) because it looked like a nice bar. And it was. Crammed chock full of political memorabilia, cigar smoke and wine, they also made a killer martini. Since I wore a short skirt, the martini's were free. What got me eating was the curious slabs of beef hanging in the window. \"Dry Aged\" is what they call it. This is not a new way of curing a steak but the very first way, pre-refrigeration, allowing the connective tissues to naturally decompose creating a very tender meat. I had what they call the Kona-Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin (or something like that) and it was fabulous! The meat melted in my mouth. Definitely a must return-to place. Then, I took a girlfriend to the Vegas one and down went the opinion polls even though I ordered the very same thing. Maybe it was the pretentious, lah-di-dah crowd waving $100 bills (newly-minted rubes from down in the holler?), the mall we had to wind through to get here fighting off aggressive Israeli \"Red Sea\" salt-crystal venders, or the over-the-top waiter (\"Eh, gulls, I killa fa yew\") and so-so steak (it obviously wasn't made for Ted Kennedy's gluttonous taste ) but that'll be an Aye vote for DC and a Nay vote for Vegas. Maybe the climate will change in '08..."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and had exceptional service and great food. The ahi appetizer was done perfectly..as well as the lamb chops. This is a top class restaurant! Be sure to take advantage of the parking valet service....very impressive."}
{"text":"Awesome. This restaurant is just awesome. Awesome food, awesome service, everything! I love coming here before seeing a show and for special occasions! I look forward to the vast wine selections and great steak!"}
{"text":"Dry Aged Steak Au Poivre is a must have! The Lobster Mac N Cheese is okay. It's nothing to gloat about."}
{"text":"Visited the Capital Grill for a wonderful valentine's dinner.     Starting with a drink at the bar, we were quickly informed that our table was ready.  Unlike most spots these days, they insisted that we not close out our bar tab and instead transferred it to our table so that we didn't have to hassle with it.   I was pleasantly surprised since it seems so many places now do not want to do that even if they can.  That said, I can no longer remember what my girlfriend and I had for dinner, as it has been almost three months since we were there, but I can say that it was all excellent.  My initial review, when I started writing it, was to be 5 stars, and my memory of the evening (even though I can't remember the specifics) remains 5 stars.    This was an excellent choice for our V Day dinner, highly recommend.  I really don't think you can go wrong with Capital Grill."}
{"text":"Great food, great champagne. Seafood tower and tuna tartar are one of my favorites. And of course nothing beats the view you get."}
{"text":"Top shelf service,  highly enjoyable, great food and service love will be back! 2 time here in 5 months, consistent and awesome!"}
{"text":"The food and service here are amazing! If you want to quickly know the real reason for my 4 star instead of 5 star review, it's because I had to change my 18 month old niece on the bathroom sink because they don't have a changing station in either bathroom. YES, capital grille, babies dine here too. I've actually never seen a restaurant that doesn't have a changing table. Ever. Do they expect people to change their kids on the floor? You have high chairs, so why not add a changing table?   Moving on, we did the chef dinner that we purchased at an auction. It was a 4 course meal for 8 people for $1,000.00. It included wine with each course too. The food was AMAZING. The beet/goat cheese salad may have been the best salad I've ever had. The tuna was melt in your mouth INCREDIBLE. The lamb was so/so-very fatty. The steak was so good and the dessert was to die for. They even sang happy birthday to my dad and brought him an extra dessert!   Overall, we loved this place. But I do think I was VERY offended by them not having a changing table, and I don't even have a kid haha."}
{"text":"Went with my sons and grandson as part of a spring training baseball tradition.  We ordered the Grand Plateau of cold seafood and it was primo.  Everything was rapidly consumed.  Ordered steak Oscar, prime rib, clam chowder and a rib eye.  Accompanied by truffle fries and brussel sprouts.  Superb in all respects.  Initial seating (less than half full dining room) was next to the kitchen.  We asked for a booth further away and the hostess complied immediately.  The waiters were very helpful throughout and not staked to any one area for service.  Tradition will continue.........."}
{"text":"I met two buddies for dinner last week. Our server was n time and served me a fantastic dirty martini with blue cheese olives. I was not in the mood for salads and appetizers. I ordered my filet, medium. The steak arrived, med rare. Our server seemed lost at that point so I finished my filet. It was dry. I know their steaks are dry aged but this was too dry for my taste. This was my last try."}
{"text":"Another one 5 star restaurant. Although this restaurant belongs to the steakhouse chain, the restaurant takes every client and steak very seriously  The managers Nick and Stephanie always make sure that the guests of the restaurant are happy with food and having a good time. Stephanie did a great job of organizing my mom's birthday party. In fact, she went to Little Italy's bakery to pick up our cake- she was wonderful! As we are the wine lock holders, we often get offers to participate in wine and food tasting events and other VIP events. I would definitely recommend to get a wine locker if you like wine and the best customer service! Couple times our bill was...zero dollars! Just because the restaurant valued its regular customers. I don't know if the customer service or food is better at this place that keeps us coming back  however, food is delicious here!  Some of my favs are tuna tartare, kale salad, sea food tower, African lobster tails (super sweet!), sushi-grade sesame tuna and creme brûlée.  Also, they have an entertaining bar area where you can gather with family&friends or just interact with other visitors. 5 star experience ;)"}
{"text":"I love this place! From the view, the service, the food, and the drinks...mmmMmmMmm!   Always greeted with a smile, seated promptly and made to feel right at home.  Amazing wine list, bottles/half bottles/by the glass.   There is baked Parmesan in their assortment of bread along with a warm roll dusted with sesame seeds.   Caesar salad was about 4/5 on my scale, however, still very good. Lobster bisque was wonderful.   Our waiter, Raul, suggested the rib eye sandwich...excellent suggestion. This delicious piece of meat topped with melted havarti and caramelized onions melts in your mouth in between two pieces of sourdough garlic bread. I couldn't believe how amazing it was.   My mom ordered the salmon with a fresh salad on the side (I can't remember the menu name). I tried the salmon and it was another melt in your mouth bite!   We will return again soon!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. i had the bone in filet. It was prepared just like I like it and was very tender and had excellent flavor."}
{"text":"My daughter took me there for birthday tonight. Restaurant week menu absolutely amazing. Everything amazing. Ricky was our server and he was awesome. Love pumpernickel bread. Would love to know how to make it."}
{"text":"Last time we ate here it was a year ago. Very refreshing to go to a restaurant and it consistently delivers on the experience. The bone in filet melted like butter on every bite. Very pleased with the meal and looking forward to the next time."}
{"text":"The only reason Capital Grille gets more than 1 star is because of atmosphere.  I've heard mixed reviews from others, so there is a chance you'll have a fine meal.  My birthday dinner here was totally unacceptable... and fortunately they credited almost the whole meal for 5 people.  The steaks were... no exaggeration... Sizzler quality.  Gritty, overcooked, blah--- ick!  To give them the benefit of the doubt, there was probably an inconsistency issue here.  Maybe they got a bad cow!  Whatever the case, for these prices and for them to maintain their chain reputation, this should have never happened."}
{"text":"By far one of the best steak houses in Las Vegas. The steaks are cooked to perfection, the potatoes are amazingly consistent and buttery. The only qualm I had w this place is the price. A tad overpriced, but the excellent service makes up for it. Truly a great place w great views of the Wynn and encore!"}
{"text":"Capital Grille is my favorite high end steakhouse, they have the consistency in service and food quality of Outback Steakhouse with justified prices for the quality of their steaks and decor.  Very nice ambiance, very friendly staff, you can't go wrong if you don't mind opening up the wallet or pocket book for a solid dining experience.    My vodka martini's are always very smooth and my steaks are always cooked to perfection.  I end up over eating because everything is so good that I reach a Zen-like state of \"food enlightenment.\"  Also the bar area is great for dates to share a bottle of wine and order appetizers.  My date knew the bartender who was extremely friendly and attentive and gave great wine recommendations."}
{"text":"Lets begin with the complimentary valet parking...so, so important for dining downtown, where parking is difficult. Yummy food! Great service! It is advisable to make a reservation before going, this place is very popular and can get very busy with may result on a long wait for table or no table availability at all! We had a good time, they do a special table and dessert for birthdays/ anniversaires...any occasion. I had the calamari! And lamb chops, Au gratin potatoes... yum! Please note it is more of a sophisticated adult atmosphere, not as suitable for children, do not dress casual, dinner and drinks for two can be expected to run you over $100. But great experience!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!  Cheeseburger with candied bacon is heavenly!  Truffle fries tasty. Bread basket is super fresh!! Crab and lobster roll is a favorite.  Desserts are huge with Cheesecake being a hit.  Mint lemonade is a must!  Good service. Excellent!"}
{"text":"The service is always wonderful and the filet mignon is a favorite of mine. Don't miss the great mashed potatoes. This is our go to place for great food, impeccable service and great ambiance."}
{"text":"I visited this place when I was on a business trip to Phoenix. My colleague and me walked out our office on a moderately warm day and were looking to grab a bite to eat.  We wandered across the street from the office into the Biltmore Mall (supposedly an upscale mall) but could not find anything to our liking.  We looked across the street and saw The Capital Grill and decided to venture into it. It is a very nice restaurant and is very tastefully decorated. Was not sure of the food when we sat down to order.  I looked at the Menu and decided to have the \"Lobster & Crab Burger\". Also ordered hand made fries with it (what the heck). If the lobster and crab were not going to clog my arteries, I was sure that the fries would do the trick!!  Was a little skeptical but my colleague also ordered the same. We looked a each other and thought that at $19 a pop for a burger it better be good.  First the fries came. Not sure if it was the hunger that was clouding the judgement but the fries were presented very nicely and were cut thin and crispy as I like it. So far so good.  The the well dressed butler (yes) served the burger with a bow and whispered \" Enjoy you meal sir\" lightly into my ears.   The burger was open faced with one half of the burger bread outside and the other half had this nice looking chunk of lobster and crab cake blended with Old Bay seasoning with a side of freshly prepared tartar sauce.   I tell you this was the best tasting crab & lobster cake I have ever had. It just melted in my mouth and I kind of licked the plate dry. It was the highlight of my day after half a day of meetings (well I need to 'fess that the other highlight was the ICC World Cup Match that I watched from 2:00 AM  - 9:00 AM).  Overall I would highly recommend this place. I am definitely coming back here on my next business trip."}
{"text":"We treated ourselves to lunch today, in grand flavors, at the Capital Grille in downtown Pittsburgh.  I ordered and enjoyed the lobster roll ($22.00), rich juicy chunks lightly seasoned and my lunch date enjoyed the Blue Burger ($18.00) rare and seasoned fries.  Both were so tasty, the service was wonderful."}
{"text":"I love Capital Grille, I don't know how there is even one bad review. I have eaten here several times. I have always had excellent service and food. I love the shrimp cocktail, Calamari, and stuffed mushroom apps. The steak salad is great and the filet melts in your mouth. I tried the coconut cream pie and fell in love, it is amazing! It is pricey but so worth it. We usually go here for very special occasions."}
{"text":"Really fantastic steaks and a lively upscale crowd make this downtown old school style steakhouse a winner. It's a meat lover's paradise and often has a bustling bar with upscale business people drinking $14 martinis and lots of talkative business crowds in the dining room. The decor is intentionally stuffy (old men oil paintings), but the superb service and lively tables drinking vino & laughing make it a winner. Perfect for Platinum Cards and big per diems. Great wines! (It's a close second to Fleming's for Steaks and sides, however, this place has a much more lively bar and dining room.)"}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I'm not a huge fan of steak houses. However, Capital Grille tries harder than most. No stuffy attitude here, just nice people and great food.   Went there for a group event, and the service was fantastic. Appetizers were terrific, and the overall meal was way above par.  We had plenty of space, and the waitstaff even checked to make sure we wanted music, and verified that the volume was acceptable.  My meal came out exactly as ordered, and the food quality was really excellent. If you're looking for a great steak place in the Las Vegas area, think Capital Grille in the mall."}
{"text":"It's been 5 years since my last review so maybe it's time for a freshening.  I go to the Capital Grille about 8 times a year, mostly for special occasions.  I went last night for the 19th anniversary of Sweeties 28th birthday.  We took the 2 children since who am I to deny them a great dinner.  The night was icy / snowy and it was glorious driving to uptown since none of the other crazies were out.  We valeted the car and were greeted by Richard one of the Managers.  Nice booth in the back and we're off to the races.  Peter and David took great care of us as always.  Very attentive and conversational without being overly pushy.    They have a children's menu here and imo it's one of the best in Charlotte.  For chump change you can feed your kids traditional kids food (Chicken fingers, grilled cheese etc...) and it allows you to have a nice night out while enjoying your food.  Started with the Tomato Mozz salad with balsamic and it was amazing.  They make their mozz in house every 2 hours or something and you can tell that it's fresh.  I went to my favorite, porcini rubbed ribeye with 15 year aged balsamic vinegar.  It's quite simply heaven on a plate, really.  They added a few new sides and one is the glazed Brussels sprouts which we tried on David's recommendation and they were glorious.  They normally come with bacon but we decided to forego the cured pig since Sweetie is a pescaterian.  Dessert, was gratis for Sweetie's birthday but we added a cheesecake for our daughter and a scoop of vanilla for the other daughter.  All the desserts were excellent.    Now here's the kicker.  When we last were there for my anniversary about 4 months ago, there was a misstep, not a big deal....but a misstep nonetheless.  I called the next day and they apologized and all was right in the world.  When we were there yesterday when David brought us our check they noted the misstep from 4 months ago and gave us a credit for Sweetie's salmon.  Who does that?  The Capital Grille, that's who.  Amazing service right?  Anyway.  I will continue to patronize this amazing place for many years to come.  The Management Staff are all excellent and this location runs like a well oiled machine.  John, Richard, and now Bradley are all there for you and you should go there now!!!"}
{"text":"Standard upscale chain steakhouse. Good food, etc. but nothing memorable. Expensive but you know that going in."}
{"text":"Good food! Fun atomosphere.  We brought a group of people here and they took care of us.  They made certain that everyone was happy.  We had excellent wine and really enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing experience from the second we walked through the door / attentive and concerned / meal was fantastic / service, WORLD CLASS"}
{"text":"I celebrated my birthday here and it was fantastic! I loved the ambience and the service! I got a nice dessert platter with a candle so that was a plus!! I will definitely try this place again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic!!  Happened to be there during a wine tasting event.  New glass with every course.   Now the courses were super.  I ordered the Delmonico steak and couldn't eat it all but it tasted so good it was hard to put it away.    I imagine all the meals are this good."}
{"text":"The Capital Grill is one of my favorite steak houses here in Las Vegas. I always get the poached lobster and fillet combo. The sauce they cook the lobster in is to die for. Last time our server even gave us a desert on the house. Great place for a dinner date."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant dozens of times.  I will keep coming back because it is the best in every regard.  Always a fantastic meal and I say that having eaten there dozens of times!  They always make you feel special especially our usual waiter Alex - they don't make waiters like Alex anymore.  For an exceptional, classy meal, this is the place."}
{"text":"My husband and I were craving a quality steak and decided to try The Capital Grille.  It didn't disappoint.  Jennifer R. was our waitress; she was very friendly, knowledgeable about the menu and gave great recommendations.  She even gave us some little extras to sample for beverages and desert.  Yes, this place is on the pricey side but the Kona steak was cooked perfectly and the sides we ordered (lobster mac, mashed potatoes, brussel sprouts) were also delicious.  The creme brulee and cheesecake are divine.  From start to finish, we enjoyed our visit."}
{"text":"Went last night for a birthday party. It was very loud and hard to hear the staff.  Waiters were very slow to get drinks and food out. We waited over 30 minutes to get our food after salads came out. One of our orders was informed 5 minutes before the food arrived that they ran out of the ribeye and we have to change your order to a sirloin. She didn't want the sirloin but they were already cooking it. Potatoes also came out cold.  Very disappointed. Not worth the money"}
{"text":"The chefs special filet mignon sliced with mushroom and onions was amazing along with the mashed potatoes. Amazing service from the new bartender. Definitely a place I will visit again"}
{"text":"Top notch, upscale and expensive. A special occasion restaurant. Go for the meat - aged beef or lamb. French onion soup is good but filling if you are planning on a big steak."}
{"text":"Came here based on a friend's recommendation, who's previous tastes have not let us down.  The ambiance is very nice with a nice view of the Wynn and part of the strip.    What we ordered: Caprese salad:  The mozarella was decent, but nothing spectacular.  The tomatoes were average, I'm surprised they didn't try using heirlooms here.  The balsamic vinegar was the highlight of the dish and made an otherwise average dish a little better.    Kona crusted filet mignon:  Boyfriend ordered this.  It wasn't bad, I've had better.  The Kona crust gave a different flavor to the steak, but the filet was a little on the dry side.  Porcini rubbed delmonico:  At first, it was over-cooked.  Ordered medium-rare / medium and it came out more towards medium / medium-well.  I cut it next to the bone and it was just pink.  I really hate to send food back, for the price I was paying, I was not too happy. The second steak was cooked to perfection.  Very good marbling.  The rub added a nice touch to an otherwise tasty steak.  Roasted Seasonal Mushrooms:  A mix of mushrooms sauteed with butter.  Good mushrooms, nothing spectacular, nothing to complain about.  Cheesecake:  Not your ordinary cheesecake.  First of all, it is round.  It is not as dense as your typical cheesecake, which is a good thing to me.  There is a creme brulee-like crust over the top.  Save room for this.  Overall, dinner for two ended up costing us over $100, and it came out to about $250 with alcohol.  The service was good, I would probably have given them a 4 if the steak was prepared to my liking the first time around.  If you are a salt and pepper steak fan like I am, I would look somewhere else.  But if you want to try something with flavors you can't find anywhere else, this is worth a shot."}
{"text":"Loved this place! My boyfriend took me here for our anniversary dinner. There is complimentary valet which was wonderful! We made a reservation for 7PM and were seated promptly.   We arrived at a table decorated with little pink hearts and a happy anniversary card with a hand written note! Joe S. was our waiter and his service was delightful! He wished us a happy anniversary and brought two glasses of complimentary champagne. We also ordered a bottle that he served us.  For our appetizer we had the calamari. Amazing and full of flavor! I got the swordfish with crab on top and it was perfectly soft and delicious. My boyfriend for the filet mignon with onion and mushrooms and it was a perfect texture and taste! We also shared a half order of the soy glazed Brussels which were savory and heavenly! The soy flavor was strong, while not being too salty.  We also got an adorable complimentary dessert! Everything from beginning to end of this experience was great and we are excited to come back again! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I had dinner with some friends here 4 days ago. It's simply marvelous. The decoration and the old mahogany wood is beautiful. It's got a very comfortable yet grand look on the inside. The entrance to the restaurant is very inspiring.    The service is second to none as expected. The food is without any mistakes. I order the Swordfish, never had it before, it was very flavorful and filling.   We are very pleased with the dinner and the overall experience. I only wish I took a picture to give an idea how this place is on the inside. Keep in mind this place is not cheap, our bill was 316 bucks, but it was well worth it.   For credit where it's due, our server was Gio L."}
{"text":"I Loooooooove being a Yelp Elite!!!!  We seriously get the red carpet rolled out for us!   The Capital Grille and its staff went above and beyond!!! One waiter in particular really stuck out, John was so knowledgeable, friendly and just fun to talk to,   THE FOOD!!!!!! OMG! I have been to this location before for dinner! Love their french onion soup!  The lunch plates are just terrific! I loved the crab cake slider and those french fries, oh my!  I could have drank a gallon of the roasted red pepper soup!   I may or may not have eaten three coconut cream pies! I have never had one that delicious before!   The rotating Yelp ice sculpture was a nice touch! So fancy!   I enjoyed getting schooled on the different cuts of meat. So informative!   Thanks so much to Lindsey, Yelp, and the Capital Grille for hosting such an amazing and memorable event!"}
{"text":"I love me some Capital Grille! It's one of the few nice steak house chains my hometown doesn't have, so I look forward to enjoying this Vegas location when visiting. The service here is superior to most other fine dining chains... some of which are hard to top! To make mine and my husband's anniversary special and memorable, they sprinkled little hearts on the white linen table, had glasses of champagne waiting for us, and completed our meal with a complimentary berry cheesecake.  I love when a variety is offered in the bread basket, and you get quite a range of flavors here from raison pumpernickel to chopped olives baked in. So good to carb out on! When on vacation, we like to splurge... so we ordered our very own salads instead of spitting one before the meal. ;-) I had the caprese while my husband went with a caesar. Both were a perfect start! I'm a filet kind of girl AND I'm a lobster kind of girl. So it was an easy choice for me to go with the lobster topped filet medallions. I would get it again in a heartbeat! My husband went with a simple filet, which tasted anything but simple. We split a side of the cheesy au gratin potatoes. They are some of the best I've ever had... and I've had a fair share of cheesy potatoes in my time! As previously mentioned, we enjoyed a piece of thick, New York style cheesecake plated with fresh berries. Though we were stuffed from our meal, it was too good not to finish the entire slice of cake.  Capital Grille... please, please, PLEASE come to St. Louis! I miss you already!"}
{"text":"Food definitely has the Wow factor.  Their bread basket had different types, all good. We got the shrimp cocktail which had giant fresh shrimp.  My bf got the kona something steak (don't remember the name of it) that was delicious.  I got the lobster Mac and cheese. I've probably tried about 10 or more different lobster Mac and cheeses in my life, this one stomps all over the others.  It was perfect.  It doesn't look like like anything special, but the quality taste will blow you away.  Our waitress Shaneen was great.  Very sweet and attentive."}
{"text":"For my money, there is no steakhouse as consistently outstanding as The Capital Grille. Whether I'm in Atlanta, D.C., or Charlotte, their steaks are always cooked to perfection, their service always world class, and their wine selection second-to-none.  My wife and I recently dined at the Charlotte location during the Queen's Feast Restaurant Week, and for the absurdly low price of $30 a person, each enjoyed a delicious 8-oz filet, two sides and a dessert. As luck would have it, our local Restaurant Week happened to coincide with the Capital Grille's Generous Pour event, so we each enjoyed glasses of four different red wines for just $25 each. When the bill finally arrived, we couldn't believe what an incredible deal we just had!  I could go on about why The Capital Grille is far and away my favorite restaurant, but you'll have to experience it yourself to understand. There's no better place to celebrate a special occasion, take a client for a business lunch, or just enjoy a fantastic steak."}
{"text":"The food here is incredible. I ordered the bone-in Kona steak and it was absolutely wonderful!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat. Food is delicious, had an opportunity to meet and speak with one of the chefs, and really got to understand how much effort goes in to selecting the rights cuts of beef. Excellent customer service!!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and staff was very progressional. I will return again.  I had the lamb chops and the lobster and cheese Mac! Delicious"}
{"text":"I hate giving bad reviews, but this place failed from beginning to end in the dining room.  Our food was so rushed and served warm at best.  For example to me the French Onion soup was pre-made with its gooy cheese and probably sat on a warming tray until served.  I mean seriously how do you order this for 5 people at your table and it all came out in 7min flat!  Not to mention that is was only luke warm and had no flavor.  Salads were overdressed and limp.  Steaks were flavorless...need I more?  I've been to several other Capital Grille's across the country and they have all be quite good, however this one needs some serious help.  On the plus side the bar and bartenders supplied excellent service and the bartenders made the perfect martini!"}
{"text":"I have never written a review however our meal was so disappointing I felt compelled to tell others. We sent nearly $300 and it was not worth it. Calamari was doughy and coating under-cooked, wife filet was rare, she ordered medium rare, she ordered medium rare my shrimp were overcooked. I would have said something had we not been with 2 other couples."}
{"text":"There are steak houses...and there are steak houses........but I consider this top shelf.  The white coats, professional service, I always find this place to be top notch.  My default dish....whether I eat at the bar or at a table is the 10oz Filet Migon and a small mash potatoes.  Now the meal above isn't for the faint of heart....without even cracking a beer of pouring a glass of wine that is a $50 meal, so getting close to $100 for lunch or dinner mind you can seem a bit pricey, but this place isn't an everyday event for me, though a special one when I do decided to patronize this place."}
{"text":"While I know most people think of a steak house when they go to the capital Grille. I like to think of It as one of the best French onion soups I have ever had. I am a French onion soup snob. The best thing about Cap Grille is the way they treat you at all of their restaurants. Just moving here from Washington DC this capital grille makes me feel right back at home! I love it!"}
{"text":"I am very very disappointed! I have dined at another Capital Grill location in Texas previously and was very pleased with that experience so this past weekend my husband and I were attending a marriage retreat seminar and our \"project\" was to plan a romantic date night. I chose Capital Grill in hopes of a wonderful romantic dinner together. The atmosphere is nice, but it was very loud, not sure if this is typical as the was the first time we dined there. The service was excellent but the food was mediocre at best and absolutely not worth the outrageous prices. Our bill was $176.00. We each had a fields green salad (my husbands salad did not even have a salad dressing and we had to wait to get dressing to pour on it) I had the salmon (which was raw and had to be sent back to be cooked more) we had one side, Au gratin potatoes that were not good and we didn't even eat half between us both. My husband had the \"special\" filet mignon that he ordered thinking that because it was the \"special\" it would be better priced. This definitely wasn't the case as it was $64, but I do understand that this was our fault we didn't ask for the price. The problem was, as the steak wasn't bad, it definitely wasn't anywhere close to the best steak he has had and absolutely not worth the price. We tried not to allow this to ruin our night, but, sadly it kind of did. I was so disappointed in the meal, then to see the tab for a meal that was not good was extremely disheartening. I NEVER write bad reviews for anything as I typically take things in stride, but this was a little over-the-top"}
{"text":"What an awesome place. Food was amazing, bread tasted so fresh. Ordered the chicken it was so big. I can honestly say it was a whole chicken. Can share with a few friends. Mashed potatoes were bomb. My husband got the stake he was beyond happy with it. Our host was amazing made sure everything wAs done right. Brought out champagne and desert on the house because we were celebrating getting married. Overall it was a wonderful experience. Will be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"I dine here pretty regularly and it's always been amazing. My favorite thing on the menu is the lobster crab cakes. They're an appetizer but I love them so much I often order them as an entree. All the steaks are wonderful. Never had a bad meal here!"}
{"text":"This place makes Ruths Chris feel like Sizzler. Our waiter John Harris did a phenomenal job explaining the menu. Well worth the trip."}
{"text":"This place was unbelievably out of this world !! From the moment u pull up to the place! Non stop service! First let me start off our waiter was absolutely amazing! Ask for Horacio!! He's great!! I ordered the filet 10oz and it was cooked to pure perfection! With sides of Au gratin potatoes and spinach! Which were also out of this world !!! For starters we had the calamari! And there's not enough stars here to give that order! My counter part ordered the filet Oscar med well- which is topped with fresh crab meat ... Soft like butter and fresh !! Amazing experience here! The ambiance is wonderful! This is a high end steak house!!! Loved it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely superb service. My boyfriend and I celebrated my birthday here, they gave us a secluded table complete with a card from the chef, decor, complimentary champagne and dessert. Our waiter, Charles, was extremely hospitable and made wonderful suggestions, giving us a great overall experience. The food was something else, we both enjoyed the calamari, seared tenderloin and poached lobster, potatoes au gratin, and asparagus. All cooked to perfection. Well worth the price and deserving of another visit. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna let everyone in on an amazing secret about this place. It is not on the menu but if you ask, they will make you a crab cocktail that is amazing! (A martini glass filled with chilled lump crap meat.) Couple that with a Chopin martini with blue cheese stuffed olives and there is no better way to start your night.  The lobster mac and classic wedge salad are both  must haves but you can't go wrong with anything on their menu."}
{"text":"I've been DYING to try Capital Grill and it just so happened to the bf's boss was taking the team and their plus ones to Capital Grill! Yay!!! Free yummy food all night. Since we were a large group, we had our own lil room with large portraits of unknown men (two to be exact)....the bf mentioned that it was a $3,000 minimum that needed to be spent.   We all started off with drinks....my Riesling was not too dry and that's the kind of wine I like. The bf's boss ordered the Coldshell Fish Platter, Pan Fried Calamari and Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarella. My favorite out of all of those was the Fried Calamari. I loved how it was a lil spicy, crispy and oh so delicious! YUM! The oysters were HUGE....almost the size of my palm. Everything else was good, but the calamari is what stood out in my mind.   For an entree, I decided to go with Seared Tenderloin with the Butter Poached Lobster and a cup of the Clam Chowder. The bf ordered some kind of steak and the Lobster Bisque. This lady at the table was raving about the Lobster Bisque and how it had real chunks of lobster in it. The soups and salads arrived fairly quickly and let's just note that the Lobster Bisque....not so awesome. Clam Chowder was definitely WAY better than the bisque. My beef tenderloins were tender and I believe there were 3 or 4 tenderloins plus the lobster. I thought it was tender and tasty, nothing too special. Lobster was cooked well and was very buttery. I was extremely full by the time my tenderloins came out so I'm not sure I appreciated it to its full extent.   For the sides, we shared everything family style. Creamed Spinach, Parmesan truffle fries, Sam's Mashed Potatoes, Lobster Mac and Cheese, Fresh Asparagus with Hollaindaise Sauce, Roasted Seasonal Mushrooms and Au Gratin Potatoes was what was ordered. Out of everything I really loved the Sam's Mashed Potatoes and the Creamed Spinach. The Lobster Mac and Cheese was probably my least favorite....not very flavorful and just not what I expected it to be. The Au Gratin Potatoes had this delightful crust on top which was pretty awesome.   Service was attentive and everything was overall fairly good. Nothing was knock me of my chair awesome, but I thought it was a good meal nonetheless."}
{"text":"We dined at Capital Grille Las Vegas on our last night in town. The hostess was very nice and gave us a table with an excellent view facing the strip.  The restaurant was not very busy at the time we visited( we had early dinner so we could catch a show). The poor review is directly attributed to our server Alex.  Alex seemed to be a bit of a cold fish with his presentations of the nightly specials. He did not offer explanations of the different chef recommendations, and he was not engaging. He made it seem as if it was a chore to serve us. I was willing to attribute this to a flat personality until another table of diners arrived. Alex transformed into a totally different person. He really turned on the charm, engaging this party about their likes and dislikes, as well as offering variations on the different preparations.  This experience was disappointing to say the least. I am not sure why Alex was so unwelcoming as we we're visitors and I had not dined at this location before. Hopefully the other locations will have the service that Capital Grille is known for."}
{"text":"Despite being a chain, The Capital Grille breaks the formula of \"tired steakhouse\", and led to one of my favorite dining experiences I've ever had, though I have a few reservations, but I'll get those in a moment.   First off, getting in was extremely easy, but it was a Monday night. Last minute anniversary idea totally worked in our favor, as we were greeted with a \"Happy anniversary!\", and led to a seemingly huge booth decorated with rose petals & cheap plastic heart pieces, which was a nice touch.   The drink selection consisted of standards like martini's and a massive wine list. We went for the basic. Dry gin martini, 3 olives. They pulled it off wonderfully, and it was shaken/poured tableside, as it should be.  We started with the calamari. They fry them up in a bready, salty batter. Almost too salty. Then, they do something awesome, and toss in chopped cherry peppers. The result is this concoction of spicy bready perfectly fried calamari. The peppers add this crazy flavor to the overall dish, which is completely unexpected and delicious. Great ratio of head vs body too. I hate it when restaurants just give me heads. I'm not afraid of tentacles!   I had the sliced filet migon with cippolini onions and wild mushrooms, finished with a 12 year balsamiq reduction. Perfect crust on the steak. The saltyness of the crust brought out the juices of the meat, when combined with the reduction, resulted in a fantastic melt-in-the mouth feel.  That being said, I wish it was a little more rare.  She had the special, which was a lamb roulade filled with an herb cream cheese and wrapped in bacon. While this proved to be a winning combination of flavors, the lamb was slightly overcooked from medium rare.   We got the lobster mac and cheese, which had huge chunks of lobster. The cheese was mascarpone, which resulted in a soupier mac, but it worked well with the lobster. We also got the french green beans with heirloom tomatoes, which while tasty, wasn't anything special.   For dessert, we were brought an espresso chocolate flourless cake, finished with raspberry sauce & fresh raspberries. Rich and delicious.  In the end, it was a fantastic meal. The Capital Grille is not the best steakhouse I've ever been to though, it is a very close second. I recommend in a heartbeat.  As a p.s: The service was top notch. I even got a phone call the next day, wanting to know how the experience was. I have never gotten that kind of attention from a restaurant before, and I doubt it will happen again."}
{"text":"In the bar: cocktail with ginger beer and grapefruit (don't remember the name) was sooo good.  App: housemade mozz wrapped in prosciotto was stupid good. Mains: filet Oscar and the delmonico. Both were cooked perfectly and were delicious. Service was great. Perfect date night :)"}
{"text":"First things first, it needs to be said: THIS IS THE BEST FRENCH ONION SOUP ON THE STRIP!  Ooey gooey cheese melting down the sides, piping hot veal broth, salty but sweet from all the caramelized onions resting on the bottom where even MORE cheese awaits! And the tiny little bit that sets it apart from other french onion soups? The baguette they use in the soup stays crispy around the edges the whole crock through. I don't know how.. black magic maybe.. but it's worth my soul. Those crispy little bits that occasionally surprise you give me the motivation to finish the whole thing. And the crock is pretty big. For $10, I've made a meal out of it.  Another worthy mention: The coconut cream pie with bourbon sauce is out of this world. I don't like desserts.. but this tart.. the bottom is chewy like a meringue with coconut, the custard is rich, the fresh whipped cream is decadent and then bourbon sauce?! Really?! I never order desserts, 100% of the time I would rather order an appetizer. This dessert came complimentary and I'm so glad it did. I would come back JUST for this dessert and a cup of their coffee (which is also good).  Other things I've tried:  -Lobster and Crab Cakes. Comes with a corn succotash. I wouldn't order it again, it was kind of fishy to me. -Shrimp Cocktail - Hit or miss. The first time was good, although a little undercooked (the top was mushy). The second time tasted like glue a little bit. Weird. -Bacon and Mushroom Spinach Salad - it was okay. The bacon had that dirty pork taste I'm not fond of and there were too many (raw) mushrooms in the salad. -The burger. Not sure which one it was since the boyfriend ordered it, but it was ground sirloin and surprisingly not that tasty. I'd prefer Bachi Burger any day. The fries were just okay.  They have a nice selection of wines by the glass, a fantastic selection by the bottle and some very delicious hand crafted cocktails.  I recommend sitting at the bar and chatting with one of the many friendly bar tenders, starting with a french onion soup, moving onto the coconut cream pie, and sipping some hot house coffee before you head out."}
{"text":"Our absolute favorite steakhouse. We come here for every special occasion and never miss the Generous Pour event. We have never had a bad meal and I usually get something new every time. This visit we had the steak and lobster and added their special of the night 1/2 lb of crab which melts in your mouth. I recommend the lobster bisque which is not on the menu but always available. If you tell them you're celebrating a special occasion they really go above and beyond to make it special. Our waiter this visit was Daniel and he was fabulous! We'll be back in a few weeks for the Generous Pour."}
{"text":"Sure, it's a chain. But the atmosphere is nice, the drinks are well made and conceived, and I thought the chicken entrée was very well prepared."}
{"text":"We had an early dinner here one night during our visit to Las Vegas.  It's really well located to the Encore hotel.  Maggiano's is directly beneath it and it was packed so we opted to go upstairs to the Grille.  Even though we were wearing only jeans and T-shirts, we were made to feel comfortable in our environment.  We were seated right away, even without a reservation, at about 6pm on a Saturday.  We had a very comfortable booth.  Our server was professional and helpful.  The food and wine we ordered came out in a timely fashion and was really delicious.  We will definitely visit again if we are in Las Vegas, and next time we'll dress to impress."}
{"text":"I don't go often, a couple times a year (strategically timed for Restaurant Week and Waygu & Wine) but when I do go, it's great. Cap Grill will not knock your socks off with innovative food or design but you should know that before going in.   I've had excellent service, weather in the bar or the dining room, by myself or with a group a friends. Personally, I prefer the bar, I'm a casual diner and get unduly nervous anywhere I must speak in hushed tones and remember which fork to use.   The food is precisely cooked and well presented. I enjoy starting with the calamari. It's mixed with fried peppers, so you might be getting squid or hot pepper; unless you're careful it's a surprise. The aioli is a must.   This is the place for a steak (medium rare). And also the home of one of the best burgers (med rare) in town.   Dessert is great - I usually opt for the flourless torte but honestly every thing I've tried has been excellent."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorites!  Just a wonderful dining experience.  The lobster bisque is the best I have ever had and if you like coconut cream pie, you must try it here.  The pineapple martini is also well worth having."}
{"text":"I had the privilege of attending a Happy Hour hosted by my apartment complex, Broadstone 1675, at the Capital Grill. My fiancé and I were so impressed with the quality of the food and drink as well as the hospitality shown by the staff. We enjoyed their signature drink, the Stoli Doli, which is vodka infused with fresh pineapple and served straight up. It was excellent! We also were treated to a variety of appetizers such as shrimp cocktail and risotto balls. The shrimp were huge and so fresh and don't even get me started on how delicious the risotto balls were. The best part was there was a raffle for a $100 gift certificate and I won! So we are very much looking forward to returning for lunch or dinner and trying some more selections off the menu. This is very much a special occasion kind of place. Not the kind of place we would be able to frequent often on our budget, but definitely the kind of place we would chose to celebrate a birthday or other special occasion. We are so grateful for the hospitality the Capital Grill showed to us and our neighbors and can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Husband and I had won a gift card to the Capitol Grill and for some crazy reason we waited until the day before it expired to use it. We started with drinks from their signature cocktails menu. We had the Stoli Doli before at a private function our apartment complex hosted back in March. I was tempted to try it again because it was so delicious but opted to try something new. I had the Bohemian which had crisp flavors of peach and raspberry topped with champagne. Small but strong and of course high quality ingredients and very fresh. Husband had the adults only Arnold Palmer which was delicious with a hint of mint, giving it a more adult taste than your traditional super sweet tea lemonade. For dinner we ordered from the bar menu (one day we will make enough money to order off the dinner menu haha) and he had the cheeseburger which came with the most delicious truffle fries. I had the calimari served with peppers but I could only eat about half of it because the portion was huge (truth be told I had a coupon for a complimentary pan fried calimari also from the private event but it was very good and I would definitely order it again). Next time I would like to try the crab and lobster cakes. Those looked tempting too. We decided to splurge and share a dessert and we were so glad we did. There were so many good options to chose from it was hard to pick just one but we landed on the double chocolate cake with cherries and ice cream. It was a molten cake with a lava filled interior and a crisper exterior. More delicious than we even thought possible. Our server was very professional and I could tell all the servers here were quite busy. The place was packed. But everyone kept their cool and provided great service. The decor here is upscale and the bathrooms are beautiful (I know that's weird to point out but it's true). Of course if you go here it's pricey but its obviously worth it for special occasions. We only spent a few dollars more than what was on our gift card but would have probably spent $80 with tip had we not had any vouchers/gift cards. Definitely a place I will return to for birthdays, anniversaries, or when special guests are in town. An impressive place for sure- complete with a beautiful walkway inn and fountains in the courtyard making it a perfect upscale date night destination."}
{"text":"Great steakhouse.  The signature strip steak is my favorite.  Lobster mac is a must.  Fried calamari and the seafood platter appetizer are great as well.  It is wonderful that Capital Grille came to downtown Pittsburgh and became an outstanding addition to the neighborhood.   The only reason this place is a 4 star is b/c it is a national chain and there is no real local flavor to it.  I personally like to dine at places specific to that locale."}
{"text":"The best steak I have ever had! The service was great and the dessert was even better!! A must go to restaurant in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I usually never write Yelp reviews but I wanted to let everyone know how above and beyond the staff at the capital grille went! My friends called ahead (about a week I think) to let them know it was my birthday. When we arrived, the table was covered in birthday confetti and they had written me a card. Our server arrived with a complimentary dish from the chef and mentioned that he'd like to toast my birthday, returning to the table with glasses of champagne for all of us (complimentary). I wish I could remember his name because he was awesome! The food was absolutely incredible and I know we will all be dreaming of it for a long time to come! Our server again surprised me at the end with a dessert plate with candle and 'Happy Birthday' written on it. We couldn't believe it when we received the bill and none of this was on it! I can't wait to return here next time we are in Vegas - excellent service and amazing food. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is the second time we've eaten at this location and third time we've eaten at The Capital Grille.  Don't waste your time going anywhere else.  This is the place you need to go.  Excellent food, excellent service.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It was a great experience, went there to celebrate my birthday with my wife. Table was decorated, food was phenomenal. Service was excellent, Greg, our server, took great care of us. Special birthday dessert with candles to blow out was on the house. An excellent dinner, highly recommended, will definitely go there again soon!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here Saturday night for our Anniversary.  We have done this each year since we were married and love it.  The table is decorated with rose petals, and heart confetti and there is a had written card on the table from your server thanking you for celebrating with them.  The service was outstanding.  Our server was great at answering questions we had about preparation and anything else.  I ordered the filet with lobster tails and my husband ordered the filet.  Both were cooked perfectly.    We also had the green beans (excellent) and scalloped potatoes that were the best I have had.    They are great at paying attention to all of the small details that make such a difference.  It is what keeps us coming back.  They even took our picture together, print it out and give you a keepsake card, which is a cute touch."}
{"text":"We had a great experience! The table was perfect with a strip view, the waiter was attentive and knowledgable about the menu. The food was delicious!! I had the French onion soup, it was one of the best I've had. My husband and kids had steak, they order them well done, the waiter suggested to butterfly them to help cook them faster and more evenly which was a great idea and they loved them. The sides were sharing sizes and delicious as well as the deserts. I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this was one of the underwhelming steakhouses we have been to recently and here is why...  SERVICE: was okay, we sat in the lounge area and had the 2 bartenders who really werent that busy, maybe 2-3 other patrons in lounge area, but we could definitely have been better cared for especially for being a steak house, service should always be a little above a typical establishment...also the bartender was a little pompous and arrogant.  AMBIANCE: was Beautiful! they have very tall windows (3 stories tall?) around a majority of the restaurant over looking the Strip (you have to sit by the window to see out to the strip). Had open table arrangement, not much chance if you prefer private/booth seating though.  FOOD: This was probably the Disappointment for me, ordered the Gargonzola & Black Truffle Dry Aged  Ny strip, and a side of Gratin potatoes and Asparagus. The wife had the Wagyu burger and Wedge Salad. Most of our main was really just okay, quality of ingredients seemed to be lacking. Nice presentation but okay flavors except the scalloped potatoes had a nice texture/flavor. For dessert  we ordered the Coconut Cream Pie (One of the Best Desserts Ever!) and Flourless chocolate cake which was good. Overall hit and miss on the food."}
{"text":"Went to Capital Grill for a lunch meeting.  Hands down, best halibut I've ever had.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for dinner while visiting Vegas. We have been to the Capital Grille a few times  at the location near us. They placed us at the best table in the house literally hanging over the Vegas strip. Started out with an ice cold Martini that was mixed perfectly. As for our order, we had a house salad, wedge salad, Wild Mushroom mix, Chilean Sea Bass, and a Rib-Eye with a balsamic reduction. What can you write about salads? Hmmmm? They were good but were your standard fare. The mushrooms were great. Quite a large order and I love mushrooms so this can make me a happy boy. My steak was a perfectly cooked medium rare. Great prime beef. We had a problem with the Chilean Sea Bass. It was raw in the middle and had to be sent back. At the prices they charge, they need to hit perfect execution every time if you want five stars. I understand there are instances but I call it like I see it. They did correct the fish and all in all a pretty fine meal.  Cheers to all"}
{"text":"The beef here is so good. I've heard a lot about The Capital Grille around the US and I always just thought....another steak house. But I was mistaken!  The dry aged selections here are divine! It doesn't hurt to have a stellar wine list and all sorts of wonderful accompaniments as well.  Great steak, excellent wine and wonderful service. What more could you ask for?  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"King crab very good.  Mashed potatoes were really really tasty. Great meal, ambiance is like them all. Classy."}
{"text":"My 1st time here.. It was so GREAT.. My BFF had her brithday dinner here .. The food was soooooooo super GREAT.. Everyone was very nice.. O.. Don't 4get to try the happy hour 6-7pm good deals"}
{"text":"Went to the capital Grille last night. Service there is really good and food is also excellent. ordered the medium well steak which is delicious."}
{"text":"Best customer experience!  Alex is the best EVER waiter.  Food is perfection.  They go all out for your birthday.  5 star every time!"}
{"text":"Celebrated birthday here, they have the best food and service, we had grilled salmon and lamb rack. Both very delicious. The waiter sent us a birthday dessert and sparkling wine. The dessert was a full size dessert with cheesecake and dads chocolate cake, the best thing for the night."}
{"text":"My husband and I walked into the restaurant at 9pm without reservations and underdressed. We were at WestWorld all day showing our horses and wanted to have a nice meal to celebrate our success. We were seated at a nice booth and the manager chit chatted with us a bit. We got our menus and the waiter, Eric went over a few things the restaurant had to offer. Wine made its way to the table upon the waiter's suggestion. It was getting late, probably about 10 and the waiter hadn't came back by to take our order. My husband caught his eye and we told him what we wanted. Myself: Lobster Bisque and Steak Tartare. My husband: Caesar Salad no anchovies and Filet Mignon medium rare. The waiter repeated our order back to us correctly and left a delicious bread assortment. The waiter swung by the table a few minutes later to ask my husband if he wanted his filet bone in and reconfirmed our order for the second time. Lol. Our soup and salads came out promptly and they were good - 1/2 way through the course the waiter came by to ask my husband if he wanted anchovies. Weird. Our plates were cleared and we waited and waited and waited in this near empty restaurant four our entrees. A food runner, not our waiter, brings out my husbands steak and offers no reason or acknowledgment of my meal. We wait 10 minutes, I go to the restroom and still my Steak Tartare was not there. Just as my husband was getting up to check on my meal, the waiter brings it out. He then asks me to go with him into the kitchen and tell the chef that I actually ordered the Steak Tartare because I guess he could not believe it according to the waiter. Crazy! My husband is furious that there was not one apology for the situation or offer to refute his now cold steak. When my husband asked the waiter why the timing of our entrees was off he said he did not put in the entree ( my tartare I assume). My husband asked for the manager and he was very gracious but did not seemed to concerned. Our meal was comped. We offered to pay for our wine and first course but they took care of it. The entrees were not eaten. We were even given two vouchers towards another visit to the Capital Grille, we passed them on to friends who are locals. The one star is for you Eric - you blew us off, treated us poorly and are not very intelligent."}
{"text":"We came to the bar for an after dinner drink and dessert. We ordered a drink and got charged for the wrong drink. We did not notice until we left. The dessert was great."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to celebrate his birthday. Our experience was amazing. They decorated our table with birthday confetti and a nice note. The food was amazing, especially the lobster Mac n cheese. The steaks were cooked and seasoned perfectly. The drinks were great as well. Our server Ricky took great care of us. We had left over steak and he boxed it up to go and threw in some mashed potatoes at no extra charge, which we really appreciated :) we are going back for Valentine's Day and can't wait!"}
{"text":"I came here from California for lunch while on a business trip for CES.  It was highly recommended by a relative.   My wife and I were seated almost immediately and had a great window seat.    The food and service was impeccable.  It was such an amazing experience that we are planning to take my parents here to celebrate 50 years of marriage!  Great job folks!  Keep it up."}
{"text":"I love sitting at the bar at the Capital Grille!  You still get to enjoy all of the glorious food with a more laid back, Chicago bar feel.  Plus, for a few months every year they bring back their burger/wine bar special that is a must try!!  You have the option of choosing from 3 different Wagyu beef burgers (all 3 are to die for), with a glass of a high tier wine (think Caymus, Bella Glos, etc), all for $25.  It is seriously the best deal in town, and it's fantastic!!    Also, I'd like to give a shout out to the bartender, Bryan.  He is incredibly attentive and knows his stuff.  Tell him I sent you in and say hello ;)"}
{"text":"We came here as a party of 11 to celebrate my in-law's 25th wedding anniversary.  I was a bit disappointed when they told me we were going to some boring, stale steak restaurant.  You open any magazine in Vegas and you'll see some exotic piece of unicorn meat teetering on top of a fragile stack of vegetables and painstakingly dotted with exotic sauces (is that mango?  Some chive oil?).  All of this is topped with a lacy piece of flair made out of something I'd never heard of or ever suspected was edible.    Ho-hum.  Another steak place.  So I thought I already knew what great steak was.  Capital Grille proved me wrong.  We tried practically every appetizer and side they offered on the menu.  Everything was beyond delicious.  Beyond fresh.  Beyond beautiful.  All meaning I stuffed myself beyond silly.    Happy Appies:    Smoked Salmon Shrimp Cocktail Oysters Proscuitto Wrapped Mozzarella with Tomatoes and Balsamic Glaze Steak Tartare  Shamefully, I admit to having more than one gluttonous bite of each of the above...plus I split a delicious spinach salad with warm bacon dressing.  Main course?  What main course?  Oh yeah, how could I forget?  I had a perfectly prepared Filet Oscar which was a beautifully prepared filet (medium rare of course) stuffed with crab stacked on top of tender asparagus and drizzled with hollandaise.  My husband had the Grille Delmonico which was a mouth-watering rib-eye with an earthy porcini mushroom rub.  Absolutely incredible.  Oh, and lobster mac and cheese and truffled parmesan French fries?  I was in heaven.  As if I had not done enough damage to my insides, then came dessert.  About five or six of them came around the table.  I'm a big chocolate fan and they certainly did their chocolate desserts justice with their chocolate hazelnut cake and their flourless espresso chocolate cake, but their coconut cream pie was to die for.    My only gripe about this place - any nice restaurant I've been to in Vegas has an amazing bar with incredible bartenders.  This place didn't.  My husband's mojito was not muddled correctly and was waaay too sweet as was my lemon-drop martini.  The mojito was not even drinkable.    The bartender didn't apologize when we had to send the mojito back and didn't ask if we wanted something else instead.   I want to knock off one star for the prick, but the rest of the experience was so good it just doesn't seem fair.  Especially since dinner service was stellar and our waitress was friendly, rolled with the punches for our large group, and definitely took care of us.    I would definitely come back to this place - even with all the other enticing restaurant ads in town - Capital Grille taught me that \"classic\" doesn't mean \"boring.\"  They made that lesson pleasant to learn.  But be warned - wear your dessert pants."}
{"text":"I came here the other day for a charity fundraiser, and wasn't too overly impressed. I mean, it's pretty much the same as any Capital Grille (if you've been to one before), although this location has a pretty great set-up: it's right in the middle of Uptown, with a great outdoor area. So that part's pretty great, actually. The interior is really nice, as you'd expect: lots of wood and dark colors in this stuffy, typical steakhouse setting.   In any event, we spent most of our time in the bar area, which under normal circumstance would've been cool: it's a large, open space with nice seating areas around it. The bar itself is well-stocked and the bartenders are pretty bad-ass. Again, you'd expect this much from a fancy steakhouse. When we were there it was incredibly packed; you couldn't move. And the clientele was pretty lame, but I guess that's what you'd expect.   The drink and wine selection here is amazing, though, and the appetizers were pretty darn tasty as well. As for the food, well, it's awesome--but you'll be paying a pretty heavy price to get some."}
{"text":"FANCY! I was intimidated by this place on the outside and when we walked in I felt right! My cousin brought me here, and I felt so underdressed in my jeans and tank top, but we sat at the bar for lunch and even though it seems like they're definitely used to a more upscale crowd, the servers/bartenders couldn't have been nicer! I love that the bartender introduced himself, asked our names, and shook our hands, just made it a wonderful experience before we even ordered our food! I had the Chilean sea bass, which tasted like a giant scallop, it was just one of the most delicious meals I've had, and with those mashed potatoes! To. Die. For. LOVED!  Can't wait to bring my boyfriend with me on my next trip out here to Charlotte and bring him for a meal!"}
{"text":"First class Restaurant, food, and staff. Bone-In Filet was out of this world. Double think lamb chops were best I ever had. Very accommodating to allergies. Already planning to come back."}
{"text":"We went to The capital Grille few days ago and loved it!!! We had the Lobster and crab cakes, spinach salad with warm bacon dressing, dry aged porterhouse steak and lobster, scallops, shrim and mussels in tomato saffron broth. Our server Maria was amazing!!! I definitely recommend this place. Great food, amazing service and wonderful ambiance!!!! We will be going back very soon!"}
{"text":"We had such a great time And such a great meal! It was our anniversary and they decorated the table for us! So cute!! Our waiter David was the best! And the desert was a gift from them! Soooo wonderfull! We adored everything!"}
{"text":"A snazzy joint.  Walked in and immediately knew this is how the uppercrust of society lives LOL I ordered the filet mignon which was delicious and truffle fries which were ho hum. I kept stealing my friends au gratin potatoes as the magic just would not stop in my mouth!! They were delicious!! We also ordered a bottle of red wine which was nice (but I don't know ANYTHING about wine). Be prepared to make it rain though.  Each of us spent like a $100 (that included like a $40 tip) but it was totally worth it.  Hey , I don't eat like this everyday right?!"}
{"text":"Located in the Fashion Show Mall. This is an upscale steakhouse, and well worth the price. Everything here was great. It is not for a casual night out. So if you are in need of a place for a special night out, I recommend. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"Enjoying upscale traditional steak house meal in biltmore mall. It's Arizona restaurant week so for 44$ each believe it or not it's great value . Ken our server & Javier both very professional thank you. The place is packed on in tues evening . Great dinner wonderful beef , breads, wine & deserts . Mouth watering & juicy. Not disappointed , 2 hour meal ."}
{"text":"Nice high end restaurant with fairly good food. Great wine selection, but make sure you're ready to pay between $150 to $500 a person.   $100 appetizer platter plus the $50 tuna plus $50 filet plus a couple of $10 sides plus two Cabernet Sauvignon bottles and 6pk of brews. Shit, my tab was little over a G!"}
{"text":"Simply stated, Capital Grille is the only place to go for drinks in the Fashion Show Mall. No, change that; it is the only place to go for drinks in Las Vegas!   Ichabod mixes a gin martini like a bartender from the forties. Love him!! Everybody loves him!! You will love him too!!"}
{"text":"There's nothing special about this capital grill bs others but I enjoy going here in the evenings for happy hour. The appetizers and drink also caps are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Yesterday, my wife and I met our FA for lunch. Our server was gracious and polite, she didn't press us to place our order. So we ended up talking for 15 minutes.  The staff made sure we that our water glasses were full. I had the Wild Mushroom Burger with truffle fries which was delicious, but I wish that the bun was thicker to better obsorb the  juices. One thing I don't care for is a soggy bun. My wife had the Lobster Salad which was okay. She asked to have the dressing on the side, but it was poured on top. She could hardly taste the lobster. Our FA had the lettuce wedge and Shrimp cocktail which she enjoyed. For her, the wedge was half the lettuce. We were treated nicely and the food was good, so we'll be back."}
{"text":"Upscale traditional American restaurant with the best service and delicious food. They have wine selection to match. They have good rotating deals (wine pairings, burger specials) if you don't want to splurge."}
{"text":"I've been to several locations for this restaurant. I'm a fan.  I love meat.  I mean, I LOVE meat.  However last night I had the opportunity to attend a Yelp event here and I love it even more.  We received a 'meat education' and it was very enlightening.  It's one thing to go and chow down on their delicious cuts of meat, but now I'm more familiar with the types of meat and the aging proces.  I know the difference between dry and wet aged meat.  How epicurean of me.    I know the difference between a porterhouse and a t bone now.  Oh my.    I also know the difference between prime and choice cuts of meat.  Check me out!  Not only did we get to learn about their meats, we got to sample.  I ve been to alot of these, but never have I been able to eat a ton of different meats at once . I\"m not made of money. Last night I got to.  I also won a $50 gift card for the above knowledge.  So yeah, I love them even more.  However I was pleased to also find out that they donate a ton of food to a local charity that feeds homeless individuals.  Working with a church that offers temporary housing for those that are transitioning from homelessneess, they provide enough food for 2 meals a day.  Wow.  I was also thrilled to learn about their $16 lunch deals.  So I can eat TWICE their for free on my gift card.  Boom, done."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. Lobster Mac n cheese. Steak was cooked perfectly! Nice place to get dressed up and enjoy a great meal"}
{"text":"Wow! I was totally blown away by my Easter brunch at The Capital Grille. Originally I was sort of bummed by my husband's Easter choice, but I ended up pleasantly surprised. The food and service definitely rated up there with the other fine steakhouses where I've dined in the past.  We made a reservation for the start of brunch service and were promptly seated next to the window. The window gave some nice people watching opportunities while we dined. The atmosphere of the restaurant was upscale, but not in a stuffy way. It was nice that other diners had dressed nicely for the occasion and the restaurant was drawing a classy crowd.  The service was very attentive from beginning to end. Our waiter was friendly, drinks were constantly refilled, plates were cleared regularly, and our meal flowed nicely. Not a single hiccup with the service. The manager/owner(?) was also walking around checking on each table which is always a nice touch.  Brunch began with a Bellini and the bread basket. My Bellini didn't disappoint and I enjoyed the breads. I opted for the Bibb Salad that had plenty of greens, dried cherries, blue cheese, and vinaigrette. It was a simple salad, but well prepared. My husband enjoyed his Caesar salad as well.  My entrée was what really impressed me. I had the 8 oz. Filet Mignon with mashed potatoes. My steak was the perfect size and perfectly prepared to medium rare as I requested. The seasoning had a wonderful flavor as well. I would say this was one of the best steaks I've ever had. The mashed potatoes had great flavor and a nice creaminess. My husband had the Lobster Frittata. This was served with a potato cake layer, frittata layer, and more lobster on top. Beautiful presentation and delicious as well. The truffled hollandaise was served on the side without even requesting it which was a nice touch.  I ventured out a little with dessert and went with the Espresso Chocolate Cake. This was very rich and had more of a fudge like consistency. I enjoyed it, but I think two could split it since it is so rich. My husband's Crème Brulee had a strong custard flavor and fresh berries on top. He loved this dessert.  I've been missing out by passing on this spot for years. Absolutely awesome service and food."}
{"text":"This is my first is my first time here and the food is very good it's beautiful inside. It's almost fine dining in with prestigious and pristine  service, very very very beautiful very very clean.   Our waiter was exceptional.   He gave us that fine wine of the house. Had us laughing throughout the whole night. The shrimp appetizers were perfect, on point, and fresh.   The salad was organic,  it was fresh, it tasted good.  The seating arrangements what was well spaced. Made me feel very comfortable eating here. Now let's talk about it entrée. I had the well-done fillet mignon and let me tell you it was on point it was on point, not  medium well, but well done it was butterflied right.   I'll definitely come by Kia any time next time I'm in Phoenix this'll be the first place I eat."}
{"text":"I was Extremely disappointed  with Capital Grille. I dine there during Queen's Feast Restaurant Week yesterday. i was very excited because i only heard good things about the place . To Start the evening off there weren't any seat left inside the restaurant so we were escorted to a dining room outside the lobby. There were so many terrible things that occur that evening where do i begin. First the ceasar salad was the worst salad i have ever had it taste like a 2 day old bag salad you get at your local grocery store. it wasn't fresh, i was missing courton in mine. Next it time for the entree.  2 of my  guest ask for a med-rare skin their  steak came   super well done . so dry i didn't know if i was filet mignon or A cheap dry roast beef.  She returned her and it came back out much better . I had the chicken breast that  once i got to the bone it blood and under cook.  and to finish the even off they were out of the cheesecake, and some of the guest  got the flourless coco cake which had molded rasphberry on her plate. yikes . it almost went in her mouth. I would have expect better quality of food for a 4 star restaurant.  She got her meal for free due to all the mistakes. but i didn't get antything for my bloody chicken. I will never go here again. :-("}
{"text":"Love. Love. Love. Great food, great service and no judgy looks for showing up on a whim. #wewereallwearingshorts We decided to have a birthday celebration there last minute and it was one heck of a party.  They brought us a special appetizer and birthday day dessert. I personally ordered the halibut and it was cooked to perfection. I also had the wedge salad. It was great but I should have gotten the dressing on the side. There was a tad too much for my preference but the taste and freshness of the ingredients could not be matched.  I was worried about not being fancy enough but they welcomed us with open arms and we had the best service ever. Thanks for making us feel welcomed and serving us delicious food!"}
{"text":"The last two times I have dined at Capital Grille's Pittsburgh location I have been rather disappointed with my meal, and this past time, not only was my meal horrible but the service was inexcusable especially at this price point. We came for a birthday celebration and it also happened to be restaurant week. Receiving our waters was by far the fastest and friendliest service of the night, mind you this person was not our server. our actual server eventually brought out our bottle of wine, a Malbec, which was enjoyed by all.   All five of us ended up ordering the RW menu. The appetizer choices were: clam chowder, wedge with blue cheese and bacon, or Caesar salad. The Caesar salad was my choice and, unfortunately besides dessert, was the highlight of the meal. Oh, and the Asiago/onion bread. Those two items tied for second best of the night. For entrees, I chose the 8 oz. filet medium rare. Others in my party chose the krona crusted ribeye for an extra $10. Our server did not deliver our food or check on us at any point. Upon cutting my steak, it was rare, not medium rare, and our server was nowhere to be found. My boyfriend ended up stopping another server requesting my steak be returned for extra cooking. Well, when it was brought back out, it was the same exact steak(at this price point I should be given a new one) and it was completely black and charred on the outside yet hardly cooked any better on the inside. Frankly, it was the worst steak I've ever had and was absolutely disgusting. The \"chef\" did bring out new accompaniments- mashed potatoes, which were ok, and green beans, which were flavorless and near raw. Not once did the server stop by and ask if everything was better nor did he ask how anyone else was doing. The server disappeared again for quite sometime and eventually cleared our plates after making multiple passes by us to visit other tables. Dessert- a flourless espresso cake with blackberry sauce- was the best item of the night, though hardly made up for the terrible entree. The fastest service from our server was when he whisked by to pick up the check presenter with credit card (again not a word said as he did so) and return it after it was processed. They did give the birthday boy a nice dessert- cheesecake plus the flourless espresso cake- but, again, does not make up for the service and terrible filet. I'd implore management to retrain this particular server as other tables around us seemed to be receiving smiling service that was at least semi attentive. Since this is the second time I have had a negative experience on some level here, I can say I will not return to this location in the future."}

{"text":"Seriously amazing service and legit food!  My husband and I ate here last weekend and we ordered a feast! Not only did we get the steak and salmon, but we got the bacon creamed corn, lobster Mac and cheese, the potatoes, and creme brûlée! Everything was soooo good and I would go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Wait was very long.  Food was bland and over cooked.  Manager tried to be responsive but to no help.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Dined alone today during my short stay in Pittsburgh. Katie was very attentive, friendly and genuine. Ordered the salmon salad, was very impressed. Cooked perfectly and very fresh. I will definitely return on my next trip."}
{"text":"Every once in a while, we like to go somewhere nice to celebrate a good day (or perhaps week). To Capital Grille we go! We love getting a drink and their crispy, spicy calamari at the bar. And it seems that every time we pull up a high-top chair, Jamie is back there being awesome. She always has a smile on her face and gives strong, yet tasty pours of our favorite drinks. One particularly hungry day, Husband and I split a cheeseburger and, well, let's just say they're my new favorite. And they're cooked to order! I'd gotten used to telling servers 'medium rare' and them hearing 'medium', much to my dismay. Not even a concern here! Perfectly warm, red center and brimming with juices. Consider my burger faith restored.  If you're coming here for the first time, I highly suggest you get Mike as your server. Always en point with wine selections and has a delightful wit. Thanks to him, we tried the crème brulee dessert, which ended up being the best we've had.  Side note: Husband always forgets to bring his cigars, but they do have a cigar-friendly patio on the bar side of the restaurant. Perhaps once the weather gets better, I'll finally remind him."}
{"text":"I cannot even begin to thank The Capital Grille for making mine and my husbands wedding anniversary so special and wonderful. Our reservation was for 1830, an there was absolutely no wait to get to our table. We were seated at a private booth, which was decorated with hearts, and topped with a beautiful card. Our waiters, Joe and Denise, were incredible. We were given excellent recommendations by them, and best of all, they took the time to stop and get to know us. We were also given complementary flutes of champagne, which was excellent as well.   The bread basket had a vast array of different breads and rolls to choose from. The shrimp cocktail appetizer had the biggest and most tender shrimp I've ever eaten. My cocktail, the bohemian, was light and delightful. For the main course, I chose the 14 oz dry-aged New York strip, while my husband went with the salmon. Each entree was Cooke to perfection. The steak was perfectly cooked (medium rare), and the portion was well worth the price. Finally, we were graciously given a dessert to share in honor of our anniversary. The plate had \"Happy Anniversary\" written in chocolate, and featured a decedent cheesecake and flourless chocolate espresso cake. Our meal was simply delicious.   The overall feel, ambience, and staff at this establishment is spectacular, bad I would highly recommend The Capital Grille to anyone celebrating a special occasion, or simply want a wonderful night out."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and a great view of the strip.  Lobster Mac & Cheese. You were told."}
{"text":"My husband and I both agree this was more like 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding up for the service and he said he'd round down for some food issues.  Having said that, the rating is all relative to the prices, which as others have mentioned are quite steep ($50 per steak on average without sides), so expectations are high.   We celebrated our anniversary here, and they do a great job with special touches like table confetti and a hand written note. Service was warm, friendly and attentive.  We got the calamari to start, which was greaseless and plentiful but honestly lacked a ton of flavor. When eaten with the cherry peppers served on top, there was a nice heat to it, but not a ton of flavor besides those peppers.   Salads were Caesar- which was classic and perfect, and a caprese type salad that was spot on. Could have used a few more basil leaves than just the one it came with.   My husband got the steak special- a bone in filet that was dry aged. It wasn't that large (10 oz which I think may have included the bone? Not sure). So for $60 you'd pretty much expect perfection. It was flavorful, but was ordered medium and it was medium in some places (where it was tender as it should be) and closer to well done in others (where it was less tender of course). I was having some of this steak and don't mind the well done as much, so I ate those parts. We didn't complain or bring the cooking issue to the waiter's attention, and I'm sure they would've cooked us a new one had we done so. But we had a show to get to, so didn't want to wait.   Side was potatoes au gratin, which was good but not amazing. Had a subtle garlic flavor and nice cheesiness / creaminess with crunchy toppling.    Dessert was comped for our anniversary and was their coconut cream pie. Splendid. It was large and had a tasty, chewy, blonde-like crust. If you love whipped cream, you'll be in heaven with this.   Overall, an enjoyable meal with a great view of the strip. Not a total 4 star, and we'd probably come back, but might try a few other places first."}
{"text":"Our favorite steakhouse in Vegas! My husband and I enjoyed a wonderful New Years Eve dinner early evening, was seated at a table with stunning panoramic views of the Strip. Server Eric was more than accommodating when we compiled our order from multiple menu items. Husband's filet mignon with Kona crust and shallot butter sauce, mine with Gorgonzola crust and Courvoisier cream sauce. As always steaks were cooked to perfection and the meal was absolutely divine!! Dessert coconut cream pie was delicious. In my opinion best steakhouse, always consistent. Excellent value, food is top quality, superb service, ambiance and view! Will be back soon, Happy New Year!!!"}
{"text":"As soon as I entered the restaurant I received 5 star service. Everyone was very friendly and Attentive. Their options on their menus are really good. We had the wedge salad it was very fresh. We orders the porterhouse steak, it was huge... big enough that Bianca and I shared it. Very juicy and tender. For our side we had the lobster macaroni and cheese........ it was so creamy, had lots of lobster and a crunch to it. I would definitely recommend Capitol grill."}
{"text":"I like Capital Grille and living in Austin I hadn't been in like 3 years so I was staying over by Kierland and wanted a  place that has great food and wouldn't mind my yappy puggle on their patio.  We called CG to see if they allow dogs and they do.  When we got there another person had their dog on the patio.  The server (Sarah or Jennifer??? very nice, short blond hair) was very attentive and got us some water and also our dog water.  I'm not the type that expects restaurants to do that for our dog, he's content to sit on the ground and have nothing, but when the restaurant and staff do make accommodations for our dog, we really really appreciate it. That being said, they're dog friendly...add a 6 star for that.  The food, amazing like always, calamari was perfectly cooked and a lot of it.  The server brought a sample of a pineapple vodka drink and I liked it so I went with one of those and then also wine.  The porcini rubbed delmonico is the star of this place and it was AWESOME. Wife had lamb and was perfect.  So, another perfect experience for us at Capital Grille.  Good thing we're moving back to valley, so i can eat there more often."}
{"text":"If your looking for superb cuisine and outstanding service this is the place to go.  My husband and I were in town for the Pro Bowl and had dinner at the Capital Grill.  The service was beyond any expectations the Manager Don Goodwin was nothing short of exceptional,  welcoming and so personable and went out of his way to make our evening enjoyable.  Our waiter Jon Yount was helpful, funny and most friendly we felt like we were at a family dinner enjoying everything.  I had eaten at the Capital Grill in Costa Mesa so when I was told by our concierge that there was a Capital Grille across the street I immediately wanted to go.  My husband had never eaten there and was a little hesitant he in fact told me if it was bad I would pay :( he was so delegated with the food and the service that we will definitely make this a must when we come back to Phoenix which we are there often.  If 200 stars were available to rate you with I would give you 400 you were fantastic and the food was so delicious.  The, steaks, salads and deserts were fantastic.   Thank you for making our evening so wonderful."}
{"text":"I went here with some friends during a bachelorette weekend in Vegas.  The entrance is pretty grand with an elevator taking you up and beautiful pictures of people like Dorothy Dandridge and Frank Sinatra adorning the walls.  We made a reservation and we were immediately seated in the corner where two windows overlooked the Las Vegas area.  It was such a background for the evening.  Our waiter, Erik was the best!! He had a dry sense of humor that our entire table loved!  The majority of our table with went different variations of steak and we order tuna tar tare, calamari, mashed potatoes, brussel sprouts, and lobster mac and cheese to pair with our meat.  EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS!! I'm not  a big seafood fan, but the tar tare was something I will remember forever!  The brussel sprouts were prepared the best I have ever had them.  The ambiance combined with the wonderful food and superb service makes this an ideal place for pretty much any occasion.  We stayed for such a long time doing girl chat and we never felt rushed to leave.  Erik was even sweet enough to bring a special congratulatory cheesecake out for our bride to be!  The experience was definitely worth the nice price tag!"}
{"text":"After two visits I can't say this place is great. Both times my steak was cooked to the wrong temperature. If a steak place can't cook a steak medium rare, they are in trouble. It wasn't close, raw the first time and well done the second visit. We sat down and waited at least 20 minutes before we saw our first drink. Once we were settled in and the waiter had time to focus on his remaining tables, the service was great. Sides were very good. One major issue I have is with the drinks. When spending $50 on a steak do not pour an on the rocks drink from a jigger. I had to order a double to get an acceptable pour. The table next to ours was also complaining about it. You can't compete with Red or Hyde Park if your only worried about your bottom line by pouring a weak drink.  Maybe after some time they can work out the kinks."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were in Vegas this weekend to celebrate our five year anniversary. I was looking for a fancy restaurant for dinner on Saturday night and am really glad that I came across this place!  Service: Their service was exceptional! I originally made reservations online for 5:00. We were running behind schedule so I called an hour before and asked if I could reschedule to 9:00, wasn't a problem at all. We arrived around 15 minutes late and were seated immediately. Our waiter was very friendly and it was obvious that he had a thorough knowledge of their menu; he had great suggestions on some of the better items on their menu. The food came out surprisingly quickly and our waiter checked up on us throughout the night to make sure everything was good.  Ambiance: The restaurant has a modern clean feel to it. It felt like we were seated at the best seat in the whole place, our view was breathtaking! Great view of the strip primarily with the Wynn and Encore on one corner and half the strip on the other.  Food: The hero of any restaurant should always be the food and this place really delivers! Their portion sizes are huge, each dish was perfect for sharing. We started off with fried calamari sautéed with garlic butter and bell peppers. It was so good that we couldn't stop eating it even though we knew we needed to save room for the main course. Great crunch with every bite. We decided to go with their Delmonico ribeye steak for our main course. One of the best steaks I've ever had. The ribeye was juicy and cooked to a perfect medium rare! They cut it in half for us which was awesome for sharing. As a side we had their backed lobster mac and cheese! Amazing! Nice crunchy layer on top with generous portions of lobster. Under the crunch the Mac and cheese was really creamy. Almost liked it more than the streak!  Looking forward to the next time I'm in Vegas so I can have another delicious steak!"}
{"text":"The epitome of fine dining. Came in as a party of 15. Our server talked us into dishes we wouldn't normally eat and everything was delicious. Ate lots of oysters..drank lots of champagne. The displays of food were exquisite. Lots of detail put into presentation.  Lots of flavor. Servers sang happy birthday to a friend and gave her a dessert sampler and took pictures of the table.  This is my \"go to \" place when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The kona NY strip is one of the best steaks I've ever had. Recommended! Great cocktails, fun staff, knowledgable sommelier made for a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"We returned to The Capital Grille, this time with some friends. I could not help myself and ordered the dry aged steak au poivre with a courvosier cream sauce again. It did not disappoint. The steak was seasoned and cooked perfectly. The cream sauce adds a nice flavor. Of course we had to have a side of the au gratin potatoes. I had talked them up, and after dinner everyone admitted we should have ordered at least one more order of them.   The service was very good. The entire staff is friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"visited here for lunch, definitely a mistake. absentee service. rude waiter. weak food. my filet was so sub-par, regretted not sending it back. I applaud them on their ability to cook a filet well-done on the sides but rare in the center. they had no bernaise or au jus or any sauce for that matter. Caesar salad was a let down as well.   just not good. what can you expect from capital grilles though? after all, it's a steak restaurant in a mall."}
{"text":"Came here for thanksgiving dinner. Location and ambiance is nice and food is always great!"}
{"text":"Decided to come to Capital Grille to celebrate my wife's new job.  A client have me a $150 gift card so it seemed like a great start.    Drinks and appetizers came quickly.  The steaks seemed to take longer than expected - waitress circled the floor 2 times before finally making it to our table.  While that only added 2 minutes more to our wait the sides were warm at best when they arrived.    The steaks were perfect as you'd expect.  What's surprising is how standard and basic all their sides are.  With Johnson and Wales here in town and so many great restaurants in town, the old standard sides were frankly boring.  It took a really long time to get our waiter back - once our food was dropped off staff pretty much ignored us.  The manager ignored us despite walking by multiple times.  They did send over a congratulatory desert which was very nice and unexpected.  Final bill $200 for 2 appetizers 2 steaks 3 sides 2 drinks and a bottle of Fiji water.  There are plenty of great restaurants and steak houses in Charlotte.  There is nothing unique or better about the capital grille than these other places."}
{"text":"Place was crowded due to convetion traffic- but service was great as expected at Capital Grille.  The steaks and seafood platters were perfect as you expect at CG.  The sides at CG are boring and uninspired.  There are more interesting steak houses with better views, great steaks, and inspired side dishes all over Las Vegas that are better."}
{"text":"Excellent filet with calamari appetizer (small squid with tentacles, excellent. don't like the large squid). Good service."}
{"text":"Here's the skimp on the Capital Grille for the average joe..  The ambiance is great, service spectacular, prices intimidatingly expensive, mixed with good quality food but just OK flavors.  I had the Kona crusted dry aged steak w/ shallot butter. I couldn't taste too much of the coffee flavor but the steak was fairly tender and the portion was huge. The shallot butter was great but I didn't have nearly enough to give the extra amount of flavor it needed. Call me crazy but this steak was not nearly good enough to stand on its own without the saltiness I'm used to. I even had to ask for au jus and even that was pretty bland. For a $47 steak a la carte I expected more flavor, A LOT more.  On the other hand, the parmesan truffle fries were amazing (as they are at every other place I've had them). The waiter even gave our table of 5 free shots as well as a complimentary dessert trio because it was my friend's birthday. The coconut cream pie that was part of that dessert was so light and fluffy, definitely the star of the night.  What can I say Capital Grille? You have 5 star ambiance/service but 3 star food."}
{"text":"We celebrated my partner's birthday and had an amazing dining experience. This was our first time dining here. We started with the jumbo crab cocktail, lobster bisque and cesar salad all which were very good. I had the filet and lobster and my partner had the bone in filet with lobster mac and cheese, they were phenomenal. In addition to the great food the service was superb. Our waiter George took great care of us. We will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"The Capital Grille is without a doubt...the BEST steak you will ever have!  We've gone to many of their locations & they are VERY consistent.  Great service, extremely nice wine selection, fabulous menu.  I wouldn't really say it's a \"romantic\" atmosphere...however it has very comfortable booths, dim lighting, valet parking, nice bar...everything!  We're going Wednesday night"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in Vegas, and had a really difficult time making a reservation at some of the more hip, interesting, celebrity-chef-run restaurants.  I was in the mood for steak, so we took a chance on the Capital Grille, of which there is a sister location in Boston, where we live.  I wasn't excited about going to a chain restaurant, even an upscale one, but we were pleasantly surprised.  The waitress was friendly and knowledgeable.  She directed me to a delicious red wine, and had no problem at all with my boyfriend and me sharing a couple of appetizers and an entree, an action that might be frowned upon in other more upscale eateries.  They separated the steak in half prior to cooking it, which was unexpected and wonderful, and gave it to us on two different plates without us having to ask.  The appetizers we shared, the Spinach Salad and the Wagyu Beef Carpaccio, were both great, and actually quite a lot of food, in addition to the warm, fresh bread we were given upon ordering drinks.  The star of the meal, the 14 oz. Dry-Aged Sirloin, was cooked to perfection, and the Parmesan Truffle Fries we ordered as a side, were delectable, though we couldn't finish them.  Our only issue, and this was a minor one, was that almost immediately after we were seated, and despite an otherwise pretty empty restaurant, a table of four relatively obnoxious people were seated directly next to us.  This might have been more of an issue if the restaurant had remained quiet, but we must have come at the right time, since in the next hour or so, the restaurant filled up quickly, and the irritating folks next to us were drowned out to some extent.  I would recommend the Capital Grille to anyone.  It's a classy place with a great menu."}
{"text":"The Capital Grill - Phoenix Location  2505 E. Camelback Road  (602) 952-8900  We arrived for our reservation at 4:30 and were promptly seated. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. We began with cocktails - a Chocolate Martini made without Godiva Liquor and a Mai Tai. The chocolate martini was sent back and was promptly replaced with a correct one made with Godiva Chocolate.  We quickly dove into the appetizers. Steak Tartare and Lobster Bisque. The Steak Tartare was arguably the finest I have ever eaten, and I have eaten this dish perhaps 40 or 50 times. The texture and seasoning were complete perfection. Were I to return to this restaurant with the ability to order only one thing off the menu, this would be it. Perfectly balanced with capers that weren't too salty, and some wonderful greens with a drizzle of what appeared to be and tested like an aged balsamic. Companion had good comments about the Lobster Bisque, especially the fact that there was more than one piece of lobster in the dish. The bisque is brought to the table with a serving of sherry which is ceremoniously poured into the dish. Personally, I prefer the sherry added at the end of the cooking so that the flavor remains, but the alcohol does not.  The menu at The Capital Grill is similar to other high end restaurants, in that all main courses are a la carte. Be warned, portions are huge, and unless you are a dyed in the wool carnivore, you will bring home a doggy bag.  After perusing the menu and changing our minds a dozen times, we settled on the Steak au Poivre and the Delmonico Steak. I asked for the Steak au Poivre to be cooked rare, and that is exactly what I got. Perfectly cooked with a Courvoisier crème sauce. The sauce was nothing to rave about, in that it added nothing to the flavor of the steak. The steak though, was perfect and huge. I will make at least one more meal out of it.  As a side dish I ordered Roasted Seasoned Mushrooms, perhaps the only poor selection on the menu. The mushrooms were without any seasoning at all - not even a pinch of fleur de sel or a touch of garlic or even some chopped shallots. Our waitress told us that they had been taken off our check, but looking at it after we left, we found that we had still been charged for them.  Companion had the Delmonico Steak (rib steak for those not in the know, and usually considered one of the most flavorful cuts of beef) served medium rare. If nothing else, the chef cooks meat to perfection. A huge cut of prime beef, tender and juicy. It's hard to go wrong with this recipe for success. Companion also ordered Cottage Fries and Onion Strings. A table of four would have had trouble finishing a portion the size of what was brought to the table. As with almost everything else, beautifully done.  We saved room for dessert, and I for one am glad I did. While companion had a scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream, which was nice and tasty and served with a tuile cookie (Pirouine perhaps), I chose the Fresh Berries in Vanilla Crème Sauce. Lush, succulent raspberries, blueberries and strawberries swimming in a nice crème anglais with a sprig of fresh mint on top. What could have been better? A perfect end to our meal.  Dings? A few - The mushrooms were terrible. I didn't finish eating them even though I love mushrooms. Some of them weren't even cooked properly. The music is terrible - not only is it way out of style for the restaurant, but also way too loud. Many times it intruded into the conversation, making it all but unintelligible.  Cudos? First and foremost for our waitress, who helped make the meal so enjoyable. Definitely for the meat and how it was cooked. Absolutely for the Steak Tartare, which I am going to be dreaming about. And strangely enough, for the immaculately clean restroom, which is something that is too often neglected.  Overall: A top restaurant that I will definitely return to if only to have the steak tartare."}
{"text":"Went for a smaller dinner in the bar.  Been dying to try the burger after a recommendation over a year ago.  It was very juicy and flavorville. Glad i passed on 5 guys. Added a nice caesar salad with anchovies.  Service was great.  I love their bread!"}
{"text":"9/22  Came to try their Restaurant Week menu, and sat at one of the tables at the bar section of the restaurant.  I liked its subdued and quaint atmosphere; however, the smooth jazz music's volume was turned up significantly as the afternoon turned into dusk.  It's a good thing I enjoy smooth jazz.  Chose the French onion soup starter, the Kona-crusted sirloin steak entree, and cheesecake w/ fresh berries sauce to finish.  I really enjoyed the onion soup- salty from the cheese, yet just enough sweetness from the caramelized onions.  I really liked how some areas of the cheese that blanketed the bowl were crispy!  I thought perhaps it was the bread that sometimes one would find below the cheese, but no, it was the cheese itself.  Wished the whole piece was crunchy...  I absolutely adored the Kona-crusted sirloin.  Cooked to medium- perfect!- and I could taste the coffee, too, and not just feel the texture of coffee grains, as I've ordered similar entrees from other venues, but never tasted the intended effect.  The caramelized shallot cream sauce absolutely floored me!  One of the best sauces that has graced my lips :)  Mmm... The entree came with two standard sides (no substitutes allowed, or at least that was what I was told) of creamed spinach and smashed red potatoes.  Both were delightful- decadently rich and creamy.  Before I forget, the table bread basket (seeded dinner rolls and lavosh) was good, especially the seeded rolls.  You may also order toasted sourdough if you have food allergies to avoid.  Stepping back down, but not much, from the piece de resistance (in this meal, the standout was the steak), was the creme brulee cheesecake w/ berry sauce w/ fresh berries!  Simply incredible!   While I had to return the more beautiful (more caramelized sugar crust) first offering, untouched, due to food issues, the second was less visually stunning, but tasted divine.  I should've asked for more sauce on the side, as I ended up taking some home.  (Believe me, it took all of my willpower to stop myself from inhaling the whole dish!)  I would definitely love to go back again!"}
{"text":"7/31/13  Took Mom here for lunch- her first, my third.  The manager, an acquaintance from a year or so ago, greeted us at the host's desk and greeted us a warm welcome.  I'd seen her here on my first visit a few months ago, so it was nice to be able to chat with her again and to introduce her to Mom.  She asked if we were celebrating a special occasion, and I said no, but that I did have a birthday earlier in the month-- it's too late to celebrate that, isn't it?  She said no it wasn't, and just to let her know if  I wanted to celebrate it, so I said \"OK, why not?\"  She said to give them a few minutes to get our table ready...  After a few minutes, we were taken to our table.  What waited for us was so touching, I had to take a picture!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-capital-grille-scottsdale?select=iIbKCsQjYDnsRh74ImLb2g#iIbKCsQjYDnsRh74ImLb2g  After asking for water, we soon gave our selections: Pan-fried calamari app, a wedge salad and a cheeseburger with truffle fries to share.  (I'd had the cheeseburger before, and I told Mom she HAD to taste it-- it's so good!)  We were hungry, and I noted that we were not given any bread.  I told Mom that this never happened before, but perhaps it was because we ordered an app and a salad.  (I had only ordered entrees on my first two visits.)  I didn't follow it up with our server Mike, since we had so much food coming.  While we waited, Mom asked me about the painted portraits on the wall- who were they of?  I knew one was of Frank Lloyd Wright, but I was not familiar with the other one, so we asked Mike.  It was of Barry Goldwater.    The food took awhile, but the wait was worth it!  Mike had asked if we wanted the app to arrive first, or if we wanted everything out at the same time.  We decided to have the app first.  We almost didn't order the calamari, since it wasn't deep-fried.  I thought that translated \"soggy.\"  Mike assured us it would be crispy.  This dish was one of the best fried calamari we've ever tried! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-capital-grille-scottsdale?select=scjjRl12emUI2ACMbM889Q#scjjRl12emUI2ACMbM889Q  Perfectly crisped, not at all greasy, and the peppers were sweet, yet spicy!  The heat slowly built up, so we were able to appreciate the sweetness of the peppers.  Mom lamented that the dish didn't come with a sauce/dip, but after she'd had a taste of the peppers with the calamari, all was forgiven!    Mike came by to check a couple of times, trying to gauge when to bring the next course, so on the second trip, I asked if he'd box the calamari, or else Mom and I would finish it and have no room for the next two courses.  A couple of minutes later, we received our wedge salad, which Mike proactively halved and served to us on two plates.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-capital-grille-scottsdale?select=EpKlL89ya06lDOYlYAMiVA#EpKlL89ya06lDOYlYAMiVA  The veggies were fresh and crisp, the bacon bits delightful.  We bought enjoyed our salads, but I did find the blue cheese too bitter to my liking, and after a few bites, I decided to just avoid the dressing.  Mike offered to get me another, if I wanted, but I said I was OK-- I didn't want to get too full and not be able to enjoy the cheeseburger, and what a glorious cheeseburger it was!  And again, Mike had it halved.  Love the service here!  We ordered it cooked medium, and the burger was perfection on two plates.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-capital-grille-scottsdale?select=SZ4XU_VQnjg6-clbK4B6WQ#SZ4XU_VQnjg6-clbK4B6WQ  If I haven't mentioned it before, the pretzel buns served with the cheeseburgers are terrific.  If you like cheeseburgers, you must try this dish!  (The truffled fries are amazing!)  After three courses, we were thoroughly satisfied, but I asked myself, what's a celebration without a sweet ending?  Mom said she couldn't eat anymore, so it was with guilt that I ordered the ice cream trio and mini-cookies (choice of three, so I asked for vanilla, choc, and strawberry), because I knew she wouldn't be able to resist trying the strawberry. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-capital-grille-scottsdale?select=_f5dyKTQsNuetmEXlwvdOw#_f5dyKTQsNuetmEXlwvdOw  All of the desserts at Capital Grille are made in-house, and I thought I'd enjoy the chocolate or vanilla best, so it was a very pleasant surprise to find that I favored the berry, while she preferred the vanilla!  All three were very good, but I found the chocolate to be a little too gritty (ice crystals).  The strawberry was so smooth and packed with so much flavor.  Mmm... I wish I could have some now!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-capital-grille-scottsdale?select=bUO6oE_yNWQFJQmvv-Kspw#bUO6oE_yNWQFJQmvv-Kspw  I couldn't try the cookies, due to the presence of powdered sugar in the batter, but Mom said I didn't miss much.    We had a fabulous lunch, and what a great place to celebrate a birthday-- thanks to the staff at The Capital Grille!"}
{"text":"We had dry aged steak, and it was very good!  The sides were also wonderful! Our server was a little odd with her theatric expressions, but attentive to our needs. An expensive meal, but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Went to Capital Grille for resturant week Pre Fix menu. I guess I was expecting more. The atmosphere was plesant and the service was not all that bad (waiter was at our table a little too much, interrupting conversation). The salad was ok. I could have had better elsewhere....lettuce was wilted. The filet was ok. My steak was not cooked very evenly and for a five star steak house I was expecting a perfect steak. It also had very little flavor itself. The port wine reduction helped with the flavor. The side was nice a truffle mac and cheese...but again nothing to write home about. Dessert was good. Pumkin cheesecake, my husband had the apple crisp. Would I go back and pay full price. NO. This is not a place for something new or different and the quality was below par."}
{"text":"**Visited on Friday, Feb. 26, 2016**   I had planned a surprise dinner for my boyfriend's birthday here and the only regret we had is that we hadn't tried this place sooner! Upon arrival, we were greeted with heart confetti and a personalized birthday card for my boyfriend. Our waiter for the night was Jeff and he was more an absolute joy to be around. Throughout the night, he came by to make sure everything was going well; not in an obnoxious way either where some servers tend to do when they continuously check up on you.   Regarding the food we had that night, for our appetizer we chose the Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarella which was out of the world amazingly good! For our main course, my boyfriend picked one of the Chef's Suggestions, \"Seared Tenderloin with Butter Poached Lobster Tails.\" Now, I know this was delicious because my boyfriend took his sweet time eating it and raving about it, when usually he is the fastest eater I know. I chose to go with the \"Seared Citrus Glazed Salmon.\" I absolutely love salmon and this was probably one of the best ones I have ever had. We also opted to go for the \"Lobster Mac 'N' Cheese\" and I tell you, it was so delicious if we had more space, we probably would have ordered another one!   At the end of our meal, Jeff brought out a platter with two desserts to share (as I had requested when making the reservation) and we also ordered two double shot esspressos to have with our dessert. Overall, this was an absolute great experience and we will without a doubt be back here again for many more occasions to come!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the bone in filet oscar style, I'm still smacking my lips! The brussels sprouts were delicious as were the other sides. I will say the drinks were pricy, as was the check! But if you're willing to splurge it was delicious!"}
{"text":"A chain should always be a well oiled machine and this spot sure is! Attentive staff that's knowledgable and recommends great options. Wine lost should be called wine lost. An iPad because there are about 529406373 wines.. I get it having variety helps but dang..."}
{"text":"I think I finally found it. Possibly the best steakhouse in the valley! I've always tried to find a steakhouse that reminds me of my all time favorite Harris of San Francisco. I'm telling you that Capital Grill was right up there with its dark mahogany decor, classic style, and fantastic service.   We were lucky enough to have gotten to try out CG on a Yelp event. I was also informed that they were the only restaurant in the valley that dry ages their meats as most others wet age them. My personal favorite is dry so that info and the tasting was all I needed for me to make dinner reservations as soon as I could. Lucky for us AZ Restaurant Week was coming and I saw GC on the list. What a great deal, $40 a person for salad, steak, dessert. We decided to forgo any drinks for the lobster Mac&cheese for $15 extra. Wow glad we did!!  Starting with the Caesar salad it was  well done.  Not much more to say here.   For dinner I ordered the 8oz Filet prepared medium. Came out perfect. I tend to like my filet more rare than medium and that's what came out. Amazing. They gave me a steak knife but I could have used a butter knife to cut the meat. I savored every bite.   The wife ordered the Kona crusted bone in ribeye. Very tasty. I loved the bone in and the Kona coffee crust! This steak was actually more tasty than mine, but I would still order the filet because of the quality. But both steaks were truly amazing!     Ending with desert the wife had the chocolate cake made without flower and I had the crème Brulé. Both were amazing.   Overall we had a amazing dinner at Capital Grill. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome first time experience. Besides the food being absolutely amazing, they wrote me and my girlfriend an anniversary card. Along with complimentary dessert, and a discount on our next visit. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"High end style, swanky food and white glove level service are all here for the taking. We had a 7pm reservation and the place was packed, from lounge to the dining room. I love that the dining room is spacious (so no getting seated within elbow bumping distance to the folks next to you.). Magnificent eagle specimen spread out to full wingspan in the airy space between the viewable kitchen and dining area. I wanted to take a pic but didn't want to disturb diners by doing so.   I ordered the beer and goat cheese salad. Fresh, including the goat cheese (I swear they just made it!), and tasty start.  Seared scallops over asparagus and Cremini mushrooms.  Absolutely perfectly done and a large serving. 6 large scallops gorgeously presented. My husband ordered the Porterhouse and it was also prepared to perfection.   We shared a side of lobster Mac that I could easily have made be my dinner for the evening  I chose the Bourbon blackberry sidecar which was balanced and expertly mixed. The Cointreau just taking the edge off the booziness of the Woodford Reserve.  I was presented with a complimentary dessert as it was my birthday.  Brule style cheesecake. Delicate with a crispy sugar crust, just as promised. Also a chocolate cheesecake...sooooo rich!  Delicious.  Husband ordered the apple berry sorbet and loved it.   We retired to the bar area after dinner to have one more spectacular cocktail. Fabulous evening.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"A couple friends were visiting and wanted to go to a really nice restaurant for dinner. This place was highly recommended for me to take them there. I was hesitant as I know it's a chain but we were very glad we went. We had reservations but still had to wait about 10 minutes to get seated. We didn't mind though as we got drinks at the bar. They were all very good. Our server was also very friendly and attentive. They give you many different kinds of bread for the table and I got the T-bone steak with Gorgonzola cheese and we split sides of the Brussels sprouts and mac and cheese. All the food was to die for and my friends said the same thing. We were very glad we decided on this place for dinner! I'm sure I will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a birthday. Reservations were easily made over the phone. When we arrived, we were promptly seated at a table decorated with birthday confetti. A card was placed on the table wishing a happy birthday.   We were seated at a table with a view of strip. The restaurant was nicely light and the ambience felt perfect for the nice birthday dinner we were about to have.   Our server recommended the calamari. Trust him and trust me, order the calamari.   We ordered the ribeye and filet mignon. Both were cooked perfectly. The sides we ordered was the Brussel sprouts and asparagus. I am not a foodie and going to use words to describe how juicy or wonderfully seasoned everything is, but we were very pleased with our meal and how everything tasted and was prepared.  We ended the night with no dessert order, but they surprised the birthday guest with a small bit of cake and candle.  Exceptional place with great service and food. By the way, there is easy parking on fashion drive."}
{"text":"Last week I was in Charlotte on business and a colleague and I chose the Capital Grille for our after work dinner location. As we approached the spot it was very quiet outside so we weren't sure if this was going to work out, but as soon as we stepped inside the energy hit us. The service was very prompt, friendly, and professional. I ordered the Cajun rubbed Delmonico steak and it was wonderful. Sauteed mushrooms as a side and a 2005 Cakebread Cabernet completed the meal. Since the place was unknown to us the unexpected pleasant surprise of the place added to the overall experience."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for your anniversary dinner. We had 515 reservations but arrived a lil bit later. We were seated right away and our waiter came shortly after. He was very nice and provided great service. There was even a hand written card wishes us well on our anniversary. The steak and lobster plate was amazing. I don't like steak but that was the first piece I ate that I could eat over and over again. Our drinks were amazing. The owner came over to ask how we were doing and made some small talk about hockey. Everyone was super nice and professional and we felt welcome. At the end they even brought out a dessert plate with cheesecake and chocolate and happy anniversary written out in chocolate. A complete surprise. That really topped everything off. The price you pay is well worth it. I'd definitely return to this location. It was awesome thank you guys!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love having my business meetings here! I always get the main lobster salad! The best service as well!"}
{"text":"I'll say this...a very good \"flow\" to the dining experience. If on a date, it's very programmed but in a good way. Make your reservation, drive to the complimentary valet, sit and have a drink at the bar, then head to your table. Very distinguished, luxurious atmosphere. Wine selections are awesome, as well as menu selection. If you're going to get a cut of meat get it here, especially the lamb. Easy on the sides...they can accommodate two people easily. It's a high end restaurant in central Uptown, so save it for an occasion...it's an easy mid 3 figure check without the gratuity. Totally worth it once in awhile."}
{"text":"I came here for restaurant week with my boyfriend and for that, it was worth it compared to the normal price of the menu. However, overall there was nothing too outstanding about the place and the menu is very overpriced.   He got the clam chowder, salmon, accompaniments (green beans and mashed potatoes) and seasonal berries cheesecake dessert off the restaurant menu ($35.18). I got the lobster Mac and cheese ($18) from the regular menu. Portion sizes were decent. We didn't finish the accompaniments and I had to force myself to finish the Mac and cheese. It had a nice crunch from the topping but it seemed to overwhelm the lobster. There was a decent balance between the textures but I wasn't dying to finish it. The chowder was pretty thick while the Mac and cheese was runny. The salmon was nice and tender, my personal favorite from the meal. The green beans and potatoes were pretty bland; I had to add salt to give them flavor. Also adding the green beans to the Mac and cheese helped to counteract the flavor.  The service was pretty good. It was our anniversary so they added a complimentary dessert. The waiter came by to check on us a few times and seemed cordial enough. We made a reservation and were seated pretty quickly after arrival.   Conclusively I would not come here again, the food was nothing special. I have seen this chain before as well. But it was a nice experience."}
{"text":"Possibly the BEST meal of my entire life! Hospitality here is bar none. You won't be sorry you chose to eat here."}
{"text":"The server is the key to success!  We had ryan. He was awesome. I asked for tea with cream and he misheard me and brought me whipped cream!  Very accommodating even though it was wrong!  Lol. French onion soup was very good, salmon was so tasty, mushrooms were meath, Brussel sprouts were so yummy. Wine recommendations were perfect and steaks at table were cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"By far the best Steakhouse in town! My husband and me shared a very pleasant and delicious Anniversary dinner here last night.  Our server Peter was wonderful and very helpful .  The food amazing! I had the10oz. Filet mignon  and my husband the salmon. Our sides were lobster Mac n  cheese ( hands down best Mac n cheese I've had in my life ) asparagus were yummy as well! Beautiful view and our complimentary dessert of flourless chocolate cake and  mini cheesecake with seasonal berries. They also gave a beautiful card congratulating us and wishing us many more anniversaries . ( sweet detail) We will def go back soon when back in town. We couldn't stop raving about how special our experience was here . Very nice hostess in front as well. We definitely give this lovely restaurant 5 starts ."}
{"text":"I came here for a business lunch from NYC and had a VERY appetizing meal. My colleagues and I did not make a reservation and we were seated almost immediately.     The staff were very nice and the food was of high quality and served speedily (as we requested due to time constraints).    I ordered the sliced mignon, one of the chef's specials and my colleagues also ordered variations of steak.  This chain steakhouse really served up a perfectly cooked mignon and I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"We were party of 7 for the birthday. My family was visiting from Japan. Our waiter was very polite.  We were recommended to order 2-3 appetizers by our waiter but we ended up ordering one because we knew we can't eat that much and came here to eat steaks not appetizers. Glad we didn't order 2-3 appetizers because it was just right amount for all of us. We ordered Caramari and it was very good. He also said we should order 3 sides to share with everyone. We ordered French fries, Brussels sprouts and asparagus according to his advise. The Brussels sprouts was on point!  Upon getting entrees, we were already overwhelmed how big our steak was. We ended up not able to finish most of the steaks and sides.  Steaks were good, and sides were good but the volume was too much even though two of us shared the one entree.  I felt like our waiter was recommending many extra food and trying to get more money from us.   Also there was a big party in the party room. We didn't like people standing right behind us when we were enjoying our dinner.   I made a reservation for this party well in advance but the location of our table was in front of the big screen by the window. It can be pretty at night but we were having hard time because flashing of lights wasn't good for our eyes."}
{"text":"This place has delicious steaks and seafood and the service is good too. We enjoyed our dinner experience and I'd recommend to try it"}
{"text":"Great place for a great meal. Lobster mac and cheese was great. Ordered a Brussels sprout salad and when it came I thought they made a mistake and brought me a spinach salad. The server said it was a Brussels sprout salad but there were no Brussels sprouts to be seen or tasted. Seems they chop them up and did not include very many so the other ingredients over powered them. I told the server if they were going to call it a Brussels sprout salad then the Brussels sprouts should be the star of the show. The chef added more and re mixed my salad and it was wonderful."}
{"text":"Capital Grille in Las Vegas has gone down hill.  This used to be one of the top steak places in Vegas.  Now that there are so many that are much better, Capital Grille needs to step up their game.  The formality and ambience was disappointing and the food was just  ok.  So sad...."}
{"text":"I had a pretty positive experience here - the service was wonderful and the meat (lamb) was really well cooked."}
{"text":"Stopped by Saturday night for dinner.  Reservations were made for a party of nine. We had a great dining experience from the service to the food. This place would get 5 stars for our server alone.  Alex was awesome. His customer service is on point and it was a pleasure to be served by him.  Started off with drinks and everything came out promptly. I can't speak for everyone else's dish, but mine was great.  I went with the gorgonzola and black truffle crusted dry aged New York strip steak cooked medium. This bad boy was nice thick slab that was cooked superbly. There was a perfect amount of pink with a nice layer of crust.  The prosciutto wrapped mozzarella was excellent. What a great combination that was made into a tasty delight. Alex brought two plates of dessert for us  since we were celebrating multiple birthdays and an anniversary. Creme Brule, awesome. Cheesecake, delicious. Flourless chocolate espresso cake, melted in your mouth. All of the desserts were exceptional."}
{"text":"I've eaten here for business and pleasure and have always had a great experience.  Nice steaks, solid sides and apps, good service in a subdued steakhouse decor.  They have an energetic vibe about the place, yet it is calming and inviting at the same time. Good eats."}
{"text":"I recently had the good fortune to eat here on someone else's expense account, which usually means a feast of epic proportions. This particular dinner did not disappoint. Several bottles of French wine from the well-curated list were procured and enjoyed. Soups and salads kicked off the meal; the wedge looked particularly good, and my French onion soup was deeply beefy and robed in enough cheese to move your cholesterol levels. I was the only person out of a party of seven to not order steak (my husband does it better than any chef), but I did not regret my shrimp stuffed with crab and lobster. My beef-eating colleagues reported that their steaks were done to perfection, and some came with intriguing extras like truffle butter. Service was impeccable, and the meal was well-paced and not rushed.  At its heart, however, the Capital Grille is still a chain, and it's hard to forget that. While the experience was flawless, if I were spending my money, I'd prefer a venue with a bit more personality."}
{"text":"I brought clients here for dinner. The food was excellent. Our server, Heather W, was fantastic. She guided us through our dining experience from start to finish. She suggested the perfect wine to complement our meal. We loved it so much we ordered two bottles. She is a true professional and the service was the best we have ever experienced. The only complaint I have is about the guy who brought the bread. He threw the basket and the butter plate on the table. The butter plate bounced into my water glass, which he over filled. We said thank you, but he did not respond. He looked distracted and never spoke or made eye contact. He made us feel very uncomfortable. His name is Jaime according to his name tag. If it weren't for him, our experience would have been flawless."}
{"text":"Always good steak and excellent service. I had their Delmonico which is their best IMHO."}
{"text":"My husband and I had an amazing dinner with our daughter and her fiancé!  They got engaged yesterday and we celebrated here.  Our waiter was amazing and  the food that fabulous!   We picked the perfect restaurant for this occasion!"}
{"text":"Went there for my anniversary and it was also my first experience at the Capital Grille.  Our server \"Elizabeth\" was exceptional.  Everything from the check in to the server to the support staff was all on point, reminding a customer like myself that the level of service a business provides is worth the extra $ you pay for it.  That being said, here is the juicy stuff:  Calamari with Cherry Peppers AMAZING AND ONE OF MY FAVORITES OF THE NIGHT! Lobster and crab cakes, Chilean Sea Bass to die for, steak and lobster incredible, Lobster Mac N'Cheese was as the menu states \"as good as it sounds, and finally the desserts; the Chocolate Lava cake and Coconut Cream Pie by which I must say is quite literally THE BEST IVE EVER HAD.  If you are in the mood for a classy night out with your spouse or significant other or even with friends: out this one on your list.  It will meet and exceed all your expectations!"}
{"text":"Just popped in for a drink at the bar.  Try the Stoli Doli.  It was... surreal."}
{"text":"Capital Grille is not a place that we go often (due to it being a bit on the pricey side), but every time we do decide to splurge, it's been fantastic.   Drinks: you MUST have a stoli doli martini. So delish. That said, why not have two and really kick up your heels?  Starters: I realize that shrimp cocktail might be considered a boring choice, but with jumbo shrimp and cocktail sauce with a kick, you'll be happy you choose this route. The mixed green salad with champagne vinegarette and the tomato mozzarella salad are also great starters (but you may want to split the later as it's quite large).  Main course: I don't eat red meat, but everyone I've dined with says that Capital Grille has the best steaks around. The salmon is also very good, and the portion size ridiculous; you'll definitely have some to take home.  Sides: you must have the creamed spinach. Even if you abhor spinach you will love this dish (which tells you just how healthy it is). The asparagus and mashed potatos are also solid side choices.  Dessert (my favorite course): get the cheesecake; you will not regret it. The top is torched like creme brulee and it comes with whip cream and berries. I've also had some of their  homemade ice cream (mint), and it was very good as well. The chocolate cake is very rich, but with a bit of ice cream on top, the perfect chocolately end to your evening.  They have a very helpful slew of valet attendants out front for free parking, so defintiely plan to use them. It's just not worth it to try to find a spot on your own, especially if you're going uptown on the weekend for dinner (at which point, you should definitely make a reservation).   If you're looking for great food, service, and to save a little money, this is the place to choose when perusing the restaurant week menu. Or if you have a special occassion and feel like splurging, Capital Grille is a sure bet."}
{"text":"Second best dining experience of my life. Seated right away to a nice table in the middle with a great view of the kitchen. My favorite restaurants generally have open kitchens where you can see the action. Started the meal with bread, which was very fresh and chilled butter. Next i had the french onion soup.. Again, second best ive ever had in my life(if you message me ill share the best place for french onion soup in Cleveland). My fiance and mother in law shared a wedge salad, which was typicall wedge, but the dressing was amazing. And the lobster bisque. Again very flavorful and huge lumps of lobster. ..  For dinner i had the kona crusted strip.. WOW was this steak flavorful. Cooked perfectly and great texture. My fiance and MIL shared the Risotto with scallops which was equally great. For sides we had the lobster mac and cheese which was great, not sure it was worth the price but it had a few chunks of lobster and asparagus that was cooked well.. Great experience and service. Cant wait for a reason to go back!"}
{"text":"I was recently invited to sample the new Summer Plates menu at The Capital Grille. Now that I am in Charlotte, I was able to try out another Capital Grille location and enjoyed a lovely lunch with my mom in uptown Charlotte. This outpost of The Capital Grille was bustling before noon on a Monday. Many business meetings and lunches are held here and the obviously enthusiastic staff kept things running smoothly and truly went above and beyond even with a close to full a house. At lunch parking is validated for the lot behind the Dunhill Hotel, making it a reasonable $2.  The Plates menu features choice of a soup or salad, an entree and a side dish for a set price of $18 at the Charlotte location. For the summer menu, a new entree of seared scallops with sweet and sour tomatoes is available. I love how the scallops are served with a grilled lemon wedge for a citrus taste that goes perfectly with the beautifully presented and cooked shellfish - delicious. The other new additions to the menu include a carrot ginger soup (hot) which I also really liked (the tasty classic New England clam chowder is still available as well) and a tomato and watermelon salad with feta cheese - a refreshing option for a side dish. The Wagyu beef burger with fried egg and crispy onions is back on the menu following multiple requests after it was featured last summer and then removed. My mom ordered this and LOVED it - and she is not usually a fan of burgers at all. The truffle fries go great with the burger, which is really a treat."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful restaurant in the heart of downtown Pittsburgh. It's not cheap, but the food was excellent, especially the brussell sprouts. Stopped there on way to a show, and since it was pouring out, they gave us an umbrella.  A very nice one, at that."}
{"text":"Nice place, everything was very fresh. Staff was polite and quick mostly though they brought my girlfriend the wrong soup at first and forgot to bring her drink with dinner.   I had the surf and turf consisting of a petit filet + lobster tail and my girl had the bone in ribeye.   255$+ tip for soup, a side, two main courses and a bottle of (relatively cheap @76$) wine, deserts on the house cause it was my birthday.    All in all it was a nice experience and I will probably be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely had one of the best servers ever in Delany. Great atmosphere and the salmon dish was excellent. Would recommend potatoes au gratin for a side."}
{"text":"Food and service is 10/10. If you come here you have to get the calamari. Menu is expensive but you get what you pay for. Only bad thing is you can't wear hats ?"}
{"text":"I'm sure most people don't go to a fancy steak restaurant for the Mac 'n cheese, but as a mac aficionado, it's practically my duty. And the mac here, well it's high quality. I like to order the lobster mac sans lobster (not a big fan of seafood), which without the seafood, is actually quite inexpensive. Now be warned, this is real heavy mac 'n cheese. It's so cheesy, and thick, and delicious; don't plan on being able to wiggle out of your booth any time soon after eating it."}
{"text":"For a good steak and some wine if you're a wine drinker do you have to go to the capital Grille service is fantastic the steak is always made to perfection and there's a plethora of wines to be enjoyed. Service is fantastic and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying a HUGE thank you to both Lindsay and the Capital Grille for such a fantastic event!  The venue was amazing, I had not had a chance to come in before and I can tell you I will be back!   Service was above and beyond amazing and the food was delicious.  My husband loved the tenderloin sliders and I was very thankful that I've started adding some seafood back into my diet and was able to enjoy those lobster rolls!   I think I'll dream of those coconut cream desserts for the rest of my life!   This was the first time I was able to actually attend an Elite event, I've always had to skip them for one reason another (sad since I'm now in my 3rd year as an Elite member) but this was absolutely amazing.  Thank you again Lindsay and everyone and Capital Grille for such an amazing event, events like these make being a Yelp Elite member truly special!"}
{"text":"I went here for a late Father's Day dinner with my dad.  It was a wonderful experience. Angel was our waitress and she was adorable! She was very knowledgable about the menu and always knew the right time to come check on us. We started with the shrimp cocktail the shrimp was delicious.  Next, we each had a salad. I got the spinach bacon salad and my father got the Caesar salad. Both were very good. Only complain was the spinach salad was heavy in the onion.  Next our entrees came. My father had the Dry Ages NY strip au poi er with courvoisier cream cooked medium rare. He liked it but his only complaint was the massive amount peppercorn on top. Not bad, just excess. He had to scrape most of it off. I had the sliced filet mignon with cipollini onions and wild mushrooms cooked medium rare. It was cooked perfectly and I loved the seasoning on it. We also shared the roasted fingerling potatoes since everything is al a carte.  All the staff was wonderfully pleasant. I will return and I am excited to explore more of the menu."}
{"text":"In my opinion and I've been coming here for 15 years to Strip.  This is the best place to eat on the strip.   Period.   Had my birthday here. Best.  Best best best.     Get out of the casino and come here. Book here.  You won't be disappointed and be entirely pleased.  I love this place.  Love it.      Steaks and wine.  Service top notch.   Sides are awesome.   Entertaining a guest - book here and you will love it."}
{"text":"Always a great meal and fantastic service! Laurel at the bar is just absolutely amazing!! Good friendly service and knows order right away! Steaks to perfection and great wine list! Definitely worth the $$!!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 5:30 without a reservation the dining room was completely empty but, hostess insisted on seating us in the bar, even though we told her we were in a hurry with theater tickets waiting. We were seated at a dark table in the corner right next to another table where we could enjoy each others conversations whether we wanted to or not. Jarrid the waiter was in the weeds and continually ignored us the entire meal. Asking if we were ready to order and when we said yes, asked us to wait while he took our carafes back to the bar. He then proceeded to wait on the other 3 tables that arrived after us. Then came back and ask us if we were ready to order again. The food deliverer brought the dinner but, there wasn't a steak knife. After 10 minutes I was able to flag down a bus boy and he got a knife. When Jarrid did return we were through with our meal and we asked for the check. He said what no dessert and we said no, we are in a hurry headed to the theater. 15 minutes later we flagged the busboy down to get us a check. Jarrid did pickup the check with my credit card and we explained again we were in a hurry, but again we had to wait. Another 15 minutes roll by still no Jarrid, finally with no choice but to get up and find him so we could leave. On departure we noticed only half the marquee sign was lit. The food was delicious but the dining experience a large disappointment at every turn. I was with a date who had never been to Capital Grill and we will not return."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our 4th anniversary here. We gave them 25 minutes from the time we called for a reservation to when we were seated.   Every person wished us a Happy Anniversary from the Hostess, to the waiter, to the manager of the restaurant.   When we arrived we had a wonderful view and the table was decorated with a handwritten note.   The waiter (Carlos) was extremely welcoming, knowledgeable and gracious. We had a great meal, great drinks and everlasting memories!  Local Visited, Local Approved :)"}
{"text":"Brian and Jeannie are the best bartenders! We came in on a Thursday night and were just planning on drinks, but were drawn in by the incredibly decadent menu. We ordered the lobster mac and cheese, (which is not for the faint of heart) and also the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella with heirloom tomatoes.  The couple next to us ordered burgers and a wedge salad that I definitely can't wait to come back and try. My only complaint is that they needed to stock up on Tito's vodka for their martinis."}
{"text":"I first found the Capital Grill when we visit Charlotte.  We now have one in Seattle.  I have frequented many 'steak' houses, and I find Capital Grill the BEST."}
{"text":"We looked for a nice place to have a happy hour and came across The Capital Grille. Our friends always spoke so negatively about the food and services, but we wanted to try it for ourselves. The food was delicious and the waiter was extremely kind.   When receiving the bill we noticed all items were charged full price. Our waiter had the \"manager\" come over and explain how we sat in the wrong section. As first time diners at The Capital Grille we were never told about cocktail hour seating. The \"manager\" was of no help and decided it was in everyone's best interest to sarcastically tease us for not knowing where to sit. He explained the cocktail hour seating was addressed online (false), on the blackboard above the bar (size 10 font), and outside the restaurant (false). We will not be returning or recommending this establishment. The \"manager\" clearly needs to take some more hospitality business courses to learn how to appropriately speak to customers."}
{"text":"Outstanding service and excellent food. We went on NYE to ring in the New Year and celebrate a birthday. As soon as we were seated, our waiter brought us a flute of champagne and our table was decorated with some confetti for the birthday.  If you're a wine drinker, they have an extensive wine list. You can search by a variety of things via their iPad or request a sommelier. I didn't order a cocktail but they had some on there that looked quite tasty.  The soup of the day was lobster bisque. If you're there when they have it, get it. My boyfriend ordered the crock of French onion soup. It's big enough for two people.  As for the steak, I don't think you can go wrong with anything. Their NY bone in strip with Gorgonzola was cooked to perfection.  Make sure to save room for dessert. We sampled the cheesecake and espresso chocolate cake. Both fabulous! If you don't like the taste of espresso, avoid this cake as the flavor is strong.  I highly recommend coming here for a date night or celebratory dinner."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the best one I've been to in a long time. The service is great the food is great! I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves a nice romantic atmosphere"}
{"text":"I had always liked this place, but something was amiss this time around. First of all the service was absolutely horrible. Considering our bill was almost $300.00 for 2 people, you would think the service and food would be good. The waiter, seemingly disappeared during our dinner and I do not believe we saw him more than the initial order and perhaps the bill. Even at that, we had to track him down to get the bill. We left 3/4 of the food on our plates, so obviously it was not good. However, he did not ask us why or inquire about the food. Very bad service overall.  The food. My husband's was mediocre as he had described it. Mine was horrible. I ordered fish, although I can not recall which type. The meal was so salty I could barely eat it. Not simply from the fish itself, although it was very \"fishy\" but the preparation tasted like 90% salt. Really horrible. I hate to say it, but it reminded me of going to Olive Garden where they pour salt all over your food to mask the lack of quality. This perhaps was even worse than Olive Garden with a steep bill at the end. Horrible. Even their infamous Pineapple Martini was a bust this time. I don't don't what is going on over there but I will NEVER return. Too many other great restaurants to visit to waste my time on Capital Grille."}
{"text":"Food: steak house. Variety of breads for bread service. Blue cheese wedge standard. Lobster bisque had real lobster bits in fair portion to the soup. Sides are for sharing! Big side portions. Mashed potatoes must. Fillet minion perfect portion for someone who doesn't have a huge appetite or who loves that cut. Cooked perfect at medium rare.   Environment: clean and intimate. Dark lighting.    Parking: valet or private/paid parking but you can validate  Service: very friendly. High end service."}
{"text":"Making my rounds of the steakhouses here in Vegas and this is a must stop for me.  There are 2 CG's in the L.A./O.C. area and I thought I'd try the one here in Vegas, since the restaurant is situated to have spectacular views of the strip.  In our case the Wynn and Encore and southward.    The entrance (from the garage) was a ride up in the elevator directly into the elevator.  I had to adjust my eyes a bit because it was dark with dark mahogany furniture.  We had a table by the window and a birthday card with glitterati candy all over the table - here for my birthday.  Love that!  I knew what I wanted to order, since a couple of days before.  I started with the lobster bisque with sherry.  The soup came out piping hot, not too thick and rich with a good amount of lobster strips.  We ordered the shrimp cocktail and forgot that we had until midway into our dinner.  We both ordered the Delmonico steak.  I had my steak prepared medium rare and the hubs had it medium well.  Medium rare the way to go...yumm!  That was a juicy piece with browned fatty corners...mmmm. Tender and tasty.  I knew this steak was taking me down it was 22 ounces! I had a fist size left over which I had later that evening as a snack...yay!  Sam's mashed potatoes was smooth with some chunks of potatoes - gosh, that was creamy rich goodness.  The spinach which I thought was going to be creamed was actually lightly steamed with bacon, I think - the steak was so good that the sides were actually SIDES and not taking over the limelight.  I enjoyed both the mashed potatoes and the spinach.  I would order these again!  I guess our server felt bad about forgetting the shrimp cocktail (and not that I was craving it or anything), so she brought our a cheesecake with berries for my birthday \"cake.\" It had caramelized sugar on top and it was so moist that it just broke apart with your fork.  I don't like cheesecake really, but this was very good.  I didn't have a cocktail because I had been drinking most of the day and my tummy wasn't feeling so hot earlier, so I thought I'd take it easy, so I can have a pleasant rest of the night.  The service was okay and nothing over the top or spectacular.  Staff was attentive enough.  I may visit one of the CG's here in L.A./O.C. At least I know what goodness awaits me."}
{"text":"Closes at 11:00PM on Saturday night. WTH? This is Las Vegas, for heaven's sake! We rolled in at about 10:50PM and were denied."}
{"text":"First tine dining at capital grill and I was impressed.    The service was extremely attentive without being too obtrusive.  The waiters have got their sh*t together!  The hostess was professional and even escorted us out the door after we finished.  We got calamari for appetizer, a hearty portion, no overly greased and perfectly roasted.  My entry was a Kona crushed steak and it was worthy of the $50 price for this dish.  Portion was huge, the steak seasoned perfectly, cooked medium rare just like I ordered.  We also got some mash potato sides and veggies.  The order of asparagus though could have been bigger for the price.  There were maybe 6 pieces of it on the side order.    The atmosphere is your typical \"as much dark mahagony as possible\" steakhouse decor.  Seats were comfortable, bathroom was meticulously clean.  If you have a special occasion to celebrate or if your using the expense account, this place is the place to blow it on!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great steaks, atmosphere and you gotta get a Stoli Doli or three."}
{"text":"Love their aged steaks (bone-in ribeye for me) and the soy-bacon-brussel sprouts.   The staff is attentive from checkin, to water service, and throughout the meal.   Especially pleasant, helpful and attentive was our waitress Katie M..   Made a Friday evening even better!"}
{"text":"Steaks were great.  Portion sizes wonderful.  I hate it when you go to a nice place and you feel like you have to order a second meal.  NOT HERE!! :)  Spinach side was meh, but atmosphere and the steak made it worth it.  Calarmari was wonderful too if you like jalapenos and other peppers!!  I'll definitely be here again.  It's about 70-90 a person though, so beware!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Pretty much any steak here will be great. Definitely try the lobster mac & cheese. The service is impeccable. Expect to spend about $100 for two, not including wine.   I will come back here every time I come back to Vegas."}
{"text":"The ambiance of The Capital Grille is excellent. It's like you have (or I have) managed to sneak into the old men's club, complete with personalized service from the moment you walk in - assuming you have a reservation, since it might be a bit creepy otherwise.  We indeed had a reservation for our anniversary, and from the time spent at the bar before the table was ready right up through the service itself, every moment of the service was outstanding. Armin and the crew were on top of their game. Rebecca did an admirable job of making the night special - even putting together an anniversary desert and picture for us before we left.  Each of the main courses was amazing. The only downside was that the sides didn't really live up to the main dishes. Since there was so much food, we probably would have been fine without them, but wanted to have something other than steak. If we go back, I think we might just skip them and go straight for the meat."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant with amazing service. The seafood is always amazing. The Brussel sprouts.... not so much it was cooked perfectly but I'm not sure why it was swimming in soy sauce which made it way to salty. Other then that my experience has always been phenomenal."}
{"text":"I went to dinner here on 5/14 for a pharmaceutical presentation.  There is free valet parking out front.  All in all, a great place to have a dinner presentation. Location/Ambience:  Located in a mall (like a lot of Capital Grilles).  Typical dark steakhouse type of ambience.  Great for business and romantic dinners.  They have a nice private room that can handle up to 40 guest.  For the presentation screen, they have a flat screen tv.  Service:  I think this was their strong point.  From the moment you walk in, the service was amazing.  There were 2-3 guys assigned to the room.  Drink orders taken and constantly refilled.  The AV guy was very helpful.  Orders were taken and food brought out in a timely fashion.  You can tell that they have dinner presentations down pat.  I requested my meal for togo and ti was packed nicely.  Only thing was that they had no togo drink cups. Food:  Was just ok.  I opted for the kona rubbed bone in sirloin.  I have never had a boned in sirloin (that was all that was offered) and will prob not again.  Mash potatoes were avg and veggies were good.   All in all, I really appreciate the great service.  I would love to go back and try their other cuts of steak.  But as far as having a dinner presentation there...A+"}
{"text":"Celebrated my husband's 30th birthday here.  Walked in and was promptly seated.  There was a birthday card signed by the staff for my husband waiting on the table. Hostess also took a picture at the booth and put it in a frame for us to take home.   Food was delicious. Had the wagyu beef carpaccio, shrimp cocktail, lobster mac and cheese. However, I was a bit disappointed in my main dish, the rib eye. It did not seem seasoned very well and didnt have much flavor. My husband had a porterhouse and had to ask for extra balsamic drizzle to give it some punch.  Other than that, we had a great time. The service was great and a majority of the meal was perfect!"}
{"text":"Great service, amazing food. Made a reservation and asked for a table by the window for our wedding anniversary. We were brought to a decorated table with a great view of the strip & a cute little card wishing us a happy anniversary, then given a complimentary champagne toast! Ordered some apps and wedge salad, and the filet mignon and lobster tail. All were amazing. Then they brought out a complimentary dessert to end the delicious meal! This place has class."}
{"text":"My cousin and I came to Vegas for a bachelorette party. Since we were the first to arrive and was famished; she wanted to treat me for my belated birthday and took me to Capital Grille for lunch. We were staying at the Trump and conveniently just walked over to Capital Grille. This was both our first time at this location. She's been to the Capital Grille in PA and I've been to Capital Grille many times in Costa Mesa, Ca.  Jeff was our waiter and we couldn't have ask for a better waiter! We LOVE him! He was vibrant, funny and very helpful with our course selection. He recommended us to try their new martinis and the lobster crab hamburger was yummy! Their coconut cream pie is to die for. I always get that for dessert! Their beef wagyu carpaccio is oh so yummy! Seared salmon salad was refreshingly delicious and their sliced filet mignon with caramelized onions and mushrooms just melts in your mouth.  Jeff was so sweet, we even took a pix with him. =) If you're in the area, ask to be seated where Jeff will be serving! Overall a great experience and the food was stellar!"}
{"text":"The staff at the capital grille was outstanding they were very helpful and did everything possible to accommodate each request. The food was AMAZING!! I had the filet and it was possibly one of the best steaks I have had. The sides were also just as delicious we had the mashed potatoes and french beans. We went the capital grille for two birthdays and a college graduation dinner and they gave us each our own dessert as well as creme brule and a carmel tart with fruit and again just like dinner they were all delicious. I would reccomend anyone going here make sure to ask for a seat by the window if possible!"}
{"text":"Dinner here on a Tuesday evening was good but not spectacular as I was expecting based from previous reviews and pricing. We were taken to our table within 5 minutes. The table had a place setting for two, I decided to sit in the chair that didn't have the setting. The manager came over, introduced herself and changed the place setting for me. She was cordial and quick. We didn't see her again after that. Ruben was professional and took our martini orders, excellently crafted and very strong..just the way I like. Our server Bryan was also professional and had thorough knowledge of the menu. I was expecting a larger menu but it did the job. My entree which was steak & 2 mini lobster tails was absolutely delicious. My husband also had steak and he liked it. Other than a piece of steak, nothing else comes on the large white sparce plate. For our a la carte item we shared mashed potatoes, they were good but not worth the $10.00 price. There was a bread basket served that consisted of a small assortment and it was okay. We were asked if we wanted bottled Fiji or Pelligrino water. Opting for just \"regular\" water was a big mistake as the water tasted disgusting. In general when I dine out I don't ask for bottled water just simple ice water with lemon and it's always been fine, not here. All in all, our experience was good but at over 200.00 including the gratuity we didn't walk away feeling impressed. We will stick with Steak 44 or Durant's in the future."}
{"text":"Some of the worst service I have ever dealt with. Ordered bottle of wine, brought the right vineyard but the wrong vintage. Took 45 minutes just to get our drinks.  Menu says a crock of French onion soup. Crock was right but in a condescending way. It came in a cup. For $11 that was sickening.  Steak was cooked perfectly but again service slow. In the end did app and entree and meal took 2.5 hours. Very disappointing experience. Been to other locations and left satisfied."}
{"text":"Food was great. Nick the manager is very good at keeping his patrons happy.  We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"The staff at The Capital Grill, Biltmore in Phoenix went above and beyond to ensure that we had an incredible dining experience. Our food was at its best from the appetizer to the three deserts we had to accompany our after dinner drinks.  Thanks again Manager Don Goodwin & our server Ricky Reyes for aiding in a great night out."}
{"text":"The Capital Grille is amazing one workd that describes this restaurant best is \"perfection\".   I tried bone in fillet steak which melts in your mouth, spinach and cream, and asparagus followed by A fruit crème brûlée.  Everything was delicious and The service was excellent.  Two thumbs up would love to come to this place again in the future."}
{"text":"We came to Capital Grille to celebrate our anniversary. They gave us the best table there with an amazing view of the strip, as well as sprinkled heart shaped confetti all over our table. They also gave us a very thoughtful handwritten card thanking us for dining with them as well as wishing us a happy anniversary. Our server Erik was also magnificent! He surprised us with free dessert to celebrate our day in the sneakiest way! Gave us dessert menus then when we were about to order he brought out the surprise, catching us completely off guard! He couldn't have made our day any more special :) thanks Erik and Capital Grille! The food was also oh so good! 10/10 would recommend the Chilean Sea Bass and Lobster Mac & Cheese"}
{"text":"Went there the Monday after mother's day for lunch with my mom. Could not explain how all the hype was worth it. Katie, I think that was her name; made it. My mother usually doesn't drink but our awesome bartender had her drinking.if your looking for a lunch celebration? Please try it out."}
{"text":"I am continually amazed at the ambiance and wonderful service I receive at this restaurant.  The filet mignon was so flavorful as well as the lemon asparagus. The cheesecake is indescribably delicious !!!"}
{"text":"I am not sure that this is going to be the review of the lifetime about the Captial Grille...but here it goes!  I went there with a couple of friends a month ago...I was worried because I was low on funds and I knew that the Capital Grille is quite pricey.    We were seated right away (we did have a reservation) and we sat at the smoking patio.  (I am not a smoker, but my friend is. It's nice to know that there are places that still offer this though.  I am not anti-smoking in restaurants)  I order one of their specialty drinks (my first mistake when trying to watch funds) and asked for the vodka to be Belvedere (My 2nd mistake)  i saw their menu and I order the lobster bisque and the chopped salad.  (2 very wise choices because prices weren't too bad and they were both very tasty)  I did look over with envy to see my friends sea bass....sigh....  After ordering my 2nd drink (third mistake) we were ready to go.  Service wasn't the best (they were more worried about the big party that was going to be seated next to us) but the food was really good.  And if I didn't order those drinks....I wouldn't have been depressed the next day that I didn't have any money left."}
{"text":"Went to Capital Grille this past weekend for dinner and we were served by Jason Philips (his business card was in our tab folio).  This is the 4th Capital Grille I visit and the service and food is always stellar.   My friend ordered the filet mignon and I ordered the citrus glazed salmon which is to die for. To share, we got the asparagus, a nice bottle of wine that was recommended by our server and the delicious cheesecake. The cheesecake is my all time favorite desert. The top is caramelized just like creme brulee. I would say it's heavenly.   I will continue to go to Capital Grille every time I'm near one.   Thank you Jason for the great service!"}
{"text":"We celebrated our wedding anniversary here, made an Open Table reservation on a Saturday at 7:15. When we arrived, we were greeted by the hostess with a \"Happy Anniversary\" and when seated, our table was decorated with hearts, a note and a rose. Nice touch. Hunter, our server introduced himself and took our drink orders.  I ordered a Stoli Doli (pineapple infused Stoli Vodka) while perusing the menu. For appetizers we ordered the Steak Tartare, entrees were the 24 oz. Dry Aged Porterhouse Steak and Caesar Salad with the Lobster and Crab Cakes.  The service from Hunter was excellent! The cocktails were fantastic. The Steak Tartare was very good but would of been better if a well was made in the beef and a raw egg was used, more traditional. The Steak was done perfectly to request and was very good. The Lobster and Crab Cakes were delicious. The weakest part of the meal was the Caesar Salad. Dressing lacked taste, no anchovies, and soggy croutons. Hunter was gracious enough to remove it from our bill. We ended our meal with a wonderful complimentary mini dessert tasting.  My only negative comment is, when a restaurant goes all out for celebrations and to make a very upscale place to dine for its patron while paying for the quality of food and service and the table diagonal from you has 2 women wearing cut off short shorts and flip flops, it is not acceptable.  Atmosphere excellent, service excellent, food very good. Thank you for making our celebration a memorable evening!"}
{"text":"Service and steak fell short of expectations. No doubt this is a nice restaurant but our server was not attentive enough. She was no where to be found when we were ready to order and ready to pay. She did bring our wines out very quickly and made sure our glasses were filled. That I do appreciate.  The steak, both mine and 2 other were *bleh**. I had the filet mignon at medium which was cooked to the correct temp. But it lacked flavor. My friend had the sirloin and it too lacked flavor. We were both expecting big bold beefy flavor but it just wasn;t there. I think a burger king beefburger had more beefy flavor. The sides were great! Loved the spinach and mushroom.  Finally, the cream brulee was very good.  So, I came for steak and I did not get good steak here. I will not be back. Should have ate at Ruth Chris instead.. and its just 4 blocks the other way.."}
{"text":"I took my friend to lunch for her birthday, and the entire experience was incredible.   A birthday card awaited at her place, \"happy birthday\" confetti was strewn on the table, PLUS the most charming waiter brought us complimentary glasses of champagne!  Also, dessert was comped.  The staff was attentive, but not intrusive or \"cutesy\", and did not seem to mind that we lingered.  The food, oh yes, we were there for lunch, was outstanding.  I will most certainly return."}
{"text":"First visit to Capital Grille to celebrate our anniversary.  We had a reservation and they had decorated the table in honor of our occasion.  Service was excellent in spite of our main waiter also serving a large party nearby at the same time.    Our meals were so-so - enjoyed crispy bacon on the spinach salad & wedge salad had same bacon (we could have easily shared 1 salad based on large portion size), porterhouse steak was unfortunately overcooked, taste was good but not great (as you might expect great based on price), citrus glazed salmon was ok although too much glaze swimming on the plate for my taste.  The side items were the highlights for us - the au gratin potatoes (AMAZING!) and the brown bread from the bread basket.  Our dinner with 2 salads, 2 entrees, 1 side, soda & 1 glass of wine came to $136.  No room for dessert but the waiter insisted on us taking home something so he brought out a flourless chocolate cake to go (complimentary for our celebration?).  We ate that tonite and it was very good even 1 day later.  There are probably a dozen other places to go for a good steak at similiar prices.  This was a splurge and not something we do often.  Captial Grille didn't knock my socks off but then neither has many of the other comparable places we've tried.  I'm glad to have had this experience but don't expect to be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I just don't get it? I eat at 4* steakhouses all the time and this one missed every where. The ingredients were good but not cooked properly. Not even close. How do you deliver a 4 oz Filet raw? It would be over cooked on my grill in 8 minutes! I pointed out the problems immediately but they just didn't listen. The manager stopped by and I indicated it was a C- at best halfway through the meal. She didn't seem to care and vanished for about 30 minutes. When she came back Everything she said made my son celebrating his birthday and I feel worse. I have never run into such abrasive management. I understand things go wrong and that's OK. Step up, show you care and make it better. At least try?  When the manager returned she saw we had eaten less than half the meal and passed on desert.??? We were celebrating a birthday? Who doesn't have desert? Then she asked how things were and I said not good. That we came expecting a great meal and it wasn't right. She asked why I didn't say something sooner? I was floored! When someone says you are delivering C- quality to your face early into the meal how could she be so attentive after that or be surprised by our disappointment? Then the check arrived and it was clear she could care less. We were just a couple of out of town diners she couldn't wait to get rid of.  I let her know in no uncertain times that Capital Grille is supposed to be all about The Experience. that by their own claims they desire \"that everything, and we mean everything, that arrives at your table at The Capital Grille delights you.\" As much as the food was average at best the least delightful thing that arrived at my table was the manager. Everything she said made it worse and I don't know how she ended up in that job? She ended up comping the meal and I still felt like I overpaid. I would have happily paid $200 for the food cooked properly and the level of service I routinely experience at Ruth Chris, Donovan's, LG's, Fleming's, The Palm etc.  Earlier in the day I spent over $500 for a 2 hour desert ATV tour with my son. It felt like a bargain in comparison. We left after dinner feeling lousy and i didnt want my son ending his night that way. We went to a Coldstone across the street. My son asked why I was taking him there as he didn't want ice creme. I said that I wanted him to see someone deliver a quality product with cheerful service. We each had a spoonful and threw out the rest. I left a $20 tip for ice creme we didn't even want or eat. But on the way home he understood the difference."}
{"text":"We LOVE Capital Grille.  Had amazing experiences at both the bar (Kevin is one of the city's BEST bartenders) and in the private dining area with a large group.  I've never seen such a well-trained, well-oiled machine, that serves great drinks, decent priced wine ($30 for a bottle of Liberty School Cab!) and amazing food.  They will let you order half-orders of sides, which is nice.  No split plate charge either!  When splitting entrees/steaks, etc., they can do that for you in the kitchen, which is also nice.  The Calamari app is very good.   The $15 Ahi Tuna app (bar area only I believe) IS AMAZING.  The bone-in NY Strip cooked to perfection (Rare plus).  Side of mushrooms and green beans were very good as well.  Never had a bad experience here.  They treat you right and the food is fantastic."}
{"text":"My husband insisted that we come to eat at The Capital Grille as his buddy from the Army had strongly recommended this place.  It's actually a chain restaurant owned by Black Angus.  Just a little interesting tidbit thrown in there for ya!  He's eaten at the Washington D.C. and Philadelphia location so now, he can add LV to his list of CGs he's been to.  My husband has raved about the quality of food and service he has received from the other locations for months so we decided to give it a try!  A group of at least 10 of us had taken a trip to LV for the weekend.  On our last evening, we had a nice dinner with Constantine as our server.  I kid you not, that was his name.  I thought of the movie, \"Constantine\" which suuuucked!  Anyhoo, he looked nothing at all like Keanu Reeves.    I was a bit disappointed by the food.  For appetizers, we had the pan fried calamari with hot cherry peppers which came out a bit cold.  The presentation was not impressive as it looked like limp, fried calamari bits strewn about, mixed with cherry peppers.  CG is known for its steaks so for the main course, I had the Kona Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin with Carmelized Shallot Butter.    I was sold on the title of the dish but upon coming out, the meat was dry after stating that I did want it cooked medium rare.  My husband had ordered the Steak Au Poivre which looked amazing and he ate every, single bite of it.  There are no sides that accompany the steak dishes so we ordered fresh vegetables and mashed potatoes.    What saves this restaurant are the desserts.  We tried the key lime pie, creme brulee, and the flourless chocolate espresso cake.  The key lime pie as my husband stated, \"Was on point.\"  It is a pricey place.  Two people would easily cost $150 without drinks.  The view is beautiful so request to be seated near the window.  I'm torn on weather I'd come here again."}
{"text":"The Capital Grille in Phoenix has the best steaks I have ever tasted. You will never be disappointed when going here, whether it's for a special occasion or just for dinner. You can't go wrong when you go here. It doesn't matter if you like steak or not, this place will make it your favorite food. Their impressive menu of nationally renowned dry aged steaks and the freshest of seafood will ignite your culinary imagination as their award-winning wine list of more than 5,000 bottles awakens your inner sommelier. I can never think about steaks the same again after eating here, the best by far is the Kona crusted sirloin. I have never heard of it before but wow was it amazing. Great cut of meat and the sauce was to die for. The French onion soup was great, very light. The soup didn't really grab my attention until I got home and was craving it. Every side dish I had was also great, the mashed potatoes were by far the best; they were hot, cheesy, and just wonderful. I never even though about putting salt or pepper on anything. Everything was perfectly seasoned and amazing. I never have really liked coconut cream pie but I enjoyed this one, so moist and creamy. The crème brulee was a little rich but the fresh fruit they put on top made it much better. Dinner ran about 60 dollars a person not including the wine. It was by far one of the most expensive meals that I have had but it was well worth it and I will most likely be going back. The service is customarily outstanding and the staff's wine and food knowledge is exceedingly above board. The waiters were well dressed and were well spoken. It was great not to have some ditsy waitress for once! No matter what questions you have regarding the restaurant they know it all. The decor is just what I expect from an old school traditional steakhouse, dark wood, cigar humidor, and oil paintings. It not overwhelming and it has this sort of calming effect. It is so much quieter than other restaurants, people talk in a low voice so you can actually hear what your waiter is saying. Everything was very clean; I don't think I could find a piece of old food anywhere if I tried. I would definitely dress a little nicer than you would at other restaurants. They don't care if you just show up in jeans and a tee-shirt but you will definitely stand out. When I went it was a surprise and wow was I underdressed. I felt so out of place and like I didn't belong. I wouldn't recommend this place to bring your children, so I would get a babysitter. You don't want your fantastic meal ruined by screaming children. For larger parties, they have a conference room in a secluded, closed off area. Whether you are having a business meeting or just a party, it is perfect for any occasion. Reservations are not need except for Friday and Saturday nights; don't expect to even see a table on these days without one. On a crowded night parking is a nightmare, I would recommend that you either make reservations really early, really late, or use the valet that they have. I wouldn't recommend going here if it is last minute because you will be waiting for a long time. The American Culinary Federation recently bestowed upon The Capital Grille the \"Achievement of Excellence Award.\" The Arizona Republic said the dry-aged steaks are, \"gloriously beefy and juicy, lightly seasoned and utterly delicious.\" You cant get a review like that if you are just any restaurant, they earned that award for sure. The only part that wasn't one hundred percent to my liking was the temperature that my steak came out. It was perfectly cooked but it wasn't that warm when I got it. It seemed like they had it out on the counter waiting for the other part of the meal, but that was the only thing that didn't meet my standards which is very good for a restaurant. I would highly recommend The Capital Grille to anyone wishing a special dining experience. The place is a little pricy but great places like this should be and believe me, it is money well spent. Best steaks, appetizers, soups, and desserts. Why go anywhere else?"}
{"text":"I'm not new to the slightly higher price point, chain steak house circuit.  If Ruth's Chris had a rewards program, my family would have free steak for life.  That being said, I know what is expected here.  It's going to be stuffy and overpriced; you know that.  But your expectation is the food and service should make up for those little trips.  +1 and I are early 20s, cute lil' professional guys.  I understand we are a contrast to the older people in floor length furs, but we didn't come in off the street like a bunch of ruffians demanding cheese fries (although the ladies behind the host podium would have disagreed).  After being greeted with \"do you have a reservation\", we let them know we were early and would have a drink at the bar until our scheduled time was up.  Drinks were fine. Whatever.  We were taken to our table which was one of two placed right in front of the kitchen and that terrifying eagle.  They're kind of like the next to the bathroom booths.  When I asked our hostess if we could move to one of the few (3+) open tables that were actually in the dining room, she said she couldn't do that (I would normally freak out over this, but somehow that pales to the rest of the night).  Our waiters and helpers/runners were awesome.  They weren't nearly as personable as you'd expect, but they didn't act like we were confused and didn't mean to be there.  Now here, judging by the other reviews, I should rave about the food.  That is absolutely not going to happen.  This is also going to be much more harsh than it should be as I was expecting (what I suppose is) way too much.  Way harsh, T. Oops.  Because I don't do seafood, we ordered the fries \"to share\" .. The portion you receive of the truffle fries is sad.  If Burgatory's truffle fries are a 10, these may get a 4.  We both ordered our double priced Caesar salads and were given small plates of yellow iceberg.  I can't tell you how sad this was.  A few shavings of asiago I was able to find saved my sanity that night. For our main courses, I ordered the chicken that makes more an hour than I do, and +1 got the strip steak.  He said it was \"good,\" but was not impressed in the slightest.  My chicken tasted like I did nothing but threw a chicken in the oven and then cut it in half and served it to you with some blackened cooked shriveling yellow carrots.  It was sad.  So sad we didn't even get dessert.  I just wanted to get out of there.  The only decent sustenance I received was 200% marked up glass of Riesling.  If you are thinking of going here, it won't be the worst.  Clearly, people enjoy it.  But if you are one of those people that may have expectations for anything ever or don't happen to have some extra change from your hedge fund to waste, keep walking until you hit Ruth's Chris or something that isn't going to make you cry into your fifty dollar piece of meat (at least that would season it)."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner before a show at the Wynn's. Our meals were wonderful, the service was outstanding and the view of the Strip was very nice. We had a reservation and got the kind of table we requested. What was a little bit annoying was the way some people were dressed for such a more upscale restaurant. Their attire was just not appropriate."}
{"text":"This upscale steak restaurant is located in the heart of downtown Charlotte (locals refer to it as uptown).  The white tablecloth restaurant is tastefully decorated with rich, dark woods and hand painted oils throughout the dining room.  This is very fine dining and it is expensive.  Entrees start around $40.  I dined here with a party of seven and we were seated at a round table.  Our server's name was DC, and he provided excellent customer service.  We started with an appetizer tray that was outstanding!  It included Shrimp Cocktail, Oysters on the half shell, Lobster, Pan-Fried Calamari, and Lobster and Crab cakes.  All were delicious, and I especially enjoyed the Calamari.  The Calamari was cooked with hot cherry peppers that gave it a nice kick.  For my entree, DC recommended the Porcini Rubbed Delmonico with 8-year aged Balsmic.  The Delmonico cut is marbled and DC recommended that it be cooked medium.  Porcini is a mushroom, and it added a sweet accent to the steak.  The steak was tender, moist, and flavorful.  The group ordered three sides to share and all were excellent.  They included Roasted Cremini, Portabella, Shiitake, and Oyster Mushrooms, Lyonnaaise Potatoes, and Fresh Asparagus.    As one of my fellow diners commented,  \"that was some mighty fine dining\"."}
{"text":"This place is located at the Fashion Mall in Vegas across from the Wynn.  Very nice decor and service.  The place was dark much like many steak houses, but this was more upscale.  The appetizers were good, but small in portion.  The steaks were pretty good, but I honestly had better.  Cost was off the hook.  I'm not cheap, but to pay this much for a steak that I feel is better at another place is ridiculous.  Anyway, if you want to impress someone, take them here for the view of the strip, ambiance and the the high prices.  Don't forget to valet as well.  If you just want to eat a good steak, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Where we go for every special occasion because the steaks are amazing. Actually everything on the menu is amazing, as are the drinks and the wine list. They always remember your name and what you drink. Its 5-star all the way. Also a great place to take clients for business dinners."}
{"text":"Everything I had was SO delicious. Here's the list: Lobster Bisque The Wedge Salad Delmonico Steak (Medium) Sides: Lobster Mac N Cheese & Fresh Creamed Spinach  Extensive wine selection."}
{"text":"Ok ok ok....yes, Capital Grille is 'spensive, and it's a upscale chain but my oh my do I love it. I love the atmosphere, I love the steak, I love the Stoli Doli martinis, I love the cheesecake with the torched topping...what can I say, I'm a sucker for a great steak accompanied by great service.   I only come to Cap Grille for special occasions, as it's certainly no cheap meal. Hubs and I can easily spend $150-$200 for a meal here (includes a few courses and adult beverages). Hence, during Charlotte's Restaurant Week(s) we always try to schedule in an affordable, delicious meal.   The service here has been nothing but extraordinary every time I've walked in - whether I was just having a martini at the bar or a full-fledged meal al fresco. I'm a big fan of the shrimp cocktail - pretentious, sure, but it's composed of colossal shrimp and the perfect spicy cocktail sauce. Their filet is just so incredible, they have always cooked it exactly to my preferences, save one particular undercooked occasion which they immediately remedied with swift service and a very sweet apology.   As for their sides, the asparagus w/Hollandaise, creamed spinach and potatoes au gratin will certainly stop your heart literally and figuratively. And last but not least, their desserts are just delectable. Per my opening remarks, their cheesecake is out of this world. It's a round, rich cheesecake with a semi-torched top and served with a smattering of fresh berries. YUM.   Every time I leave Capital Grille I feel very full but very, very happy!"}
{"text":"Joe was our amazing waiter and he made the night incredibly enjoyable! We went out for my parents anniversary and they rolled out the red carpet- confetti on the table, a card, champagne toast for the four of us, and a divine dessert tray with cheesecake and a decadent chocolate dessert. We each had a different steak and they were all great. The lobster mac and cheese, calamari, asparagus, and creamed corn were all excellent, and their wine list was good. We spent a mortgage payment on dinner, but it was a wonderful place to dine for such a special occasion."}
{"text":"This is heaven for steak lovers like me! High quality and moody...I enjoyed my time very well."}
{"text":"This is my 24th trip to 'Vegas and I've eaten at some great Steakhouses...you name it, I've been there, but we keep coming back to Capital Grille. Bone-in filet mignon, grilled asparagus. Su gratin potatoes and to start, prosciutto wrapped mozzarella. EVERYTHING cooked to perfection; exceptional service and great ambiance. Worth the money. Did iment"}
{"text":"we had dinner there tonight. they were not very clear on the difference between the restaurant week menu and normal menu which caused mass confusion after the food was on the table. we also seemed to be an inconvenience to the waiter as he seemed annoyed by our simple requests. also they failed to fill water glasses and drinks in a timely manner. the bartender did not know how to make a slow gin fiz. they couldn't add the drinks from the bar because the waiter couldn't do the math i guess so we had to calculate. the placed lacked culture and I would suggest Durrants if you like real fine dining with legitimate customer service. to be fair, the food was good despite the above..."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to visiting  TCG for a while.  Maybe I had too high expectations.  But I was very disappointed.  The filet of mignon had no taste they did not even put salt and pepper on it no crust and it was very tough hard to chew.   The chef may have had a off day.    Filet mignon should melt in your mouth and should be able to cut it with a fork, could barely chew it.    The staff and waiters were excellent - They are 5 stars but the food was terrible.  beware."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my daughters graduation and I must say this place had Exceptional service. Food was delicious! And the presentation, divine. If you love steak, this place is for you.  If you love dessert, this place is for you.  If you love wine, this place is for you.   I'm telling you, you will not be disappointed. So I recommend you make a reservation ASAP"}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner here. Upon arrival there was a 30 min wait which is expected for a Saturday. Instead of waiting we sat at the bar. It was a really busy night so the bar staff wasn't as attentive but i'm sure thats because there were so many people there. I ordered a stoli doli to drink and it was so good i had to have another. It's vodka that has been siting in pineapples for a week. Great drink for ladies and men and it will make you a bit tipsy lol. For food I ordered the tenderloin with lobster tail and my boyfriend ordered the 16oz bone in filet. For sides we had the gratin potatoes and the mushrooms. All amazing picks especially the gratin potatoes. The only thing I didn't like that much was my steak. It was suppose to be medium and they gave me medium well. It had slight char taste which I hate so i just loaded A1 sauce and it made it better. I didn't feel like sending it back, it wasn't that big of a deal to me. Would I come back definitely. Great food, atmosphere, wait staff, and drinks."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for Valentine's day this year and had an amazing dinner. Alex was our awesome server and he recommended our new favorite wine. Pricey but definitely worth it if you like Cabernet Sauvignon. We started with their Clam Chowder and Caprese salad. Without a doubt, their Caprese was the best I have ever tried. Their Clam Chowder was also very good but not the best.  I ordered the Seared Tenderloin with Butter Poached Lobster and my boyfriend ordered the Dry Aged Sirloin steak. My steak and lobster were delicious, but holy cow, my boyfriend's steak was so flavorful! We ordered two sides and barely touched them since we were focusing on our steaks. Make sure not to over order since their sides are big. Each side can serve about four people. Overall, a great dinner overlooking the Las Vegas Strip.  If you eat here, do request a window seat."}
{"text":"I have to move this over to my 5-star club.  Every experience I have here is just amazing. I love to sit at the bar. Paul is just a tremendous bartender and all around great guy. He takes such good care of us every time we come in for drinks or food.  My must get app: the calamari. With the peppers, it doesn't need any kind of sauce. Holy.  Item I'm currently obsessing over: the Chilled Seared Sushi Grade Tuna. I always get steak when I come here (I mean duh, why wouldn't you?), but I've recently become addicted to this. Absolutely delicious. I go with the bar menu version. Smaller portion than the entree. I pour the wasabi oil over all of it... then take alternate dipping pieces in the other two. Money.  End every meal here with a shot of Sambucca. Trust me on that one."}
{"text":"I'll tell you, if you ever want to enjoy a  steak anywhere else, ever again, don't eat here. The steak here will create expectations that no other steak house can meet. I've had the the bone in NY strip steak with Gorgonzola & truffle sauce about 3 times and is probably the best thing I've ever eaten. Thank you Capital Grill, you've ruined steak for me and i can no longer eat steak anywhere else."}
{"text":"The filet mignon was cooked perfectly, the lobster mac and cheese is delicious and the service is amazing. Highly recommend going to The Capital Grille for any special occasion."}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend here for dinner this past weekend for his birthday. They had decorated the table and had a hand written card on the table. We had reservations and were seated immediately. We had a table by the window as requested with a nice view. Server was very helpful & knowledgeable of the menu. Hands down the best filet mignon I've ever had. Mashed potatoes and the cheesecake were great as well. Will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"Attended a business lunch here today and as always, food, service and atmosphere were TOP-NOTCH!"}
{"text":"I have to be honest... when I first heard the name of this place, I thought it was going to be bar food or something pretty typical. My honey decided to surprise me for restaurant week and this was the place of choice. I was actually a bit disappointed when he told me since my first idea of their selection was initially incorrect.   He told me to dress up, and I was thinking he was crazy or something... dress up for bar food?? What? Ok... I have to admit, I'm pretty stubborn, so uttering the words, \"You were right\" as we walked in the door of this beautiful place wasn't easy. I felt as if I were an actress in the silver screen era with the beautiful artwork, and almost royal looking furnishings. The lights were set to a low romantic level and the place was buzzing with a sophisticated crowd.   When we walked in and I got over the romantic candle lights flickering lazily in the dining area. The hosts and hostess were super attentive and We told them we had reservations. We were told there was still going to be a wait.,which I figured may be the case for restaurant week. They had some chairs to the side so we sat to the wayside, and watched a couple people get sat before us who came in after us. I went up and asked them for a menu and they realized we had been there for a bit. The hostess was great, and she put us at the top of the list to be sat. She apologized and we were fine. After we sat down we ordered, and the food came out in great time.   He ordered the 8 oz Kona Parmesan steak for his meal and I had the Salmon. The sides that came with these meals were spinach and mashed potatoes. Now, I've said that many places were good, and I've given many 5 star reviews, but MY GOD I think they should make an exception for even more stars for some places.   When I took that first taste of my salmon... time stopped as my taste buds exploded. I thought it couldn't get any better, and then I tried the potatoes... If foodgasms were real. This is it folks. I'm serious... Capital Grill has the BEST food I have ever eaten in my entire life. I could have wept from the amazingness on my palate. The salmon was so juicy and perfect. The potatoes... oh those potatoes... I could write an entire review on those alone. Perfect.   Now the most amazing part and quite possibly the best customer service I have ever experienced in my life. We got our bill and my honey had ordered an All American and then changed his mind and switched to a B&B, both drinks ended up being on the bill. We weren't upset by it at all, but a manager came over when he saw us looking around for our waitress.   He asked if everything was ok, and when we explained the mix up, he apologized profusely and told us he would take both drinks off of our bill!! We told him he didn't have to do that because we did have the one drink, but he insisted and said it would make his night to make this right for us. WOW!!! We were amazed!!  There is seriously nothing negative I can say about this place, and I think it'll be a great place for any special occasion. Hmmm... my birthday IS right around the corner... :)"}
{"text":"Pricey and contrived, this place feels perfect for the tourist crowd and the loud, blow-hardy lunch meeting crowd. At the front desk, the head of the party's name is requested; once at the table, the server addresses the head person by name in an attempt to make the party feel welcome, special, or familiar.  It comes off as lame.   That said, our waiter was as nice as could be. We started with glasses of wine (a nice Malbec and a pinot noir, reasonably priced at around $10-$12). The caesar salad that followed was decent but forgettable. For the main, I got \"sushi grade tuna\" with ginger rice. The tuna was nice and hugely portioned, but I would have preferred it to be sliced before it got to the table.  There's something unpleasantly animalistic about cutting into a giant hunk of raw meat.  As a side, we ordered the truffle oil and parmesan fries, which were fantastic. I had espresso pie and an espresso for dessert. Again, both items were decent but forgettable. When all is said and done, I'm 100% OK with this one trip being my last. Nice experience, satisfactory food...but for a bill of $250 for two people, I would have expected a bit more panache."}
{"text":"5:15 reservation they sat us at 6:15. We were six people who were sat at a four top. My chair was touching the chair of the person behind me so no one could get by. The waiter asked me to get up and move so he could get by, what???  So when I sat sideways against the wall (due to no moving room) he said thank you. Not okay.   There was an elderly man who needed a seat and went roaming into the coat room in desperation for a chair because he was standing for 30 minutes waiting for a table that he made a reservation for. No one noticed so I went into the coat room myself (as a customer) to bring him a chair so he didn't fall down.   After asking ourselves to be sat at a table where we weren't being hit by customers and waiters, we were moved to a regular table. Then our food was an hour late because the kitchen \"made a mistake\" on roasted chicken. (?)  If you want an anxiety free calm place that gives attention to comfort, this restaurant may not be for you."}
{"text":"Great place for a special ocasion celebratory dinner! My girlfriend and I like to go there on our special nights and it's always perfect. Food, service, atmosphere all is great and definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say about The Capital Grille! My boyfriend and I have been a few times and the service and food have been amazing each time. I know this is a steak house but I highly recommend the tuna. It was absolutely delicious as was the lobster Mac n cheese! The lobster bisque was great too, lots of lobster in it! Our server Amber was wonderful. We mentioned that we were there for a late valentines dinner and at the end of our meal she brought out 2 complimentary desserts! Cheesecake and chocolate espresso cake, omg they were to die for and the perfect size. She also gave me a rose for valentines as well, which was super sweet. This restaurant is a bit on the expensive side but if you have a special occasion this is the place to come to get a great meal plus they treat you like gold! It's an all around great dining experience that is so worth it!"}
{"text":"This place has great food, impecable service, and a fantastic view of the strip! I went for lunch and got the lobster bisk with cream cherry...yum!"}
{"text":"I went for a nice meal tonight and wound up with a rather bad experience. I first sat in the bar and got a drink. After watching the bartender cater to a group of five while I sat alone and waited 10 minutes for a menu I decided to sit somewhere else in the main dining room.  Kevin then served me. Everything was fine until a party of eight showed up and then he could care less about me and did not show up but once every 20 minutes. Of course when he did come by he wanted to know if I wanted another $20 glass of wine to pump up the bill.  Stay away from this place because the servers just want to make their money on the big parties. And my tip to Kevin showed it. I have been known to tip a lot. Usually 50%. But not tonight and I will not go back. Typical West Coast environment. Short term"}
{"text":"If you ever find yourself in the mood for a excellent fine dining experience from the service to the entire menu this is the place you need to go"}
{"text":"We were greeted and seated right away. Our server Magic Mike was very attentive and he has great personality. Food was excellent"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently moved to Charlotte and we were looking for good food and our expectations were too high. The steaks were not seasoned at all, just tasted like meat, but we are so used to going to Ruth's Chris, where the steaks are phenomenal. The service was great and the lobster bisque and tails are a must try. I now know never to order steak from here only their lobsters."}
{"text":"Had the porter house. Unreal. The winner of the night was the lobster mac and cheese though."}
{"text":"I came here without a reservation and was able to find a seat at the bar before the bar was too busy too order food.  If you would like to dine, then I recommend a reservation.  For appetizer, I had the Lobster Bisque soup by recommendation of the bartender Michael. He was spot on with his recommendation. The soup was excellent. I cleaned the bowl with the warm bread we were given.  With his credibility established, we ordered a few other of Michael's recommendations: the Sirloin, the Porterhouse, and the Lobster Mac'n'Cheese. The steaks were the portions which they were advertised to be. Furthermore, they were both cooked to medium-rare as we requested; however, the outside of the steak was a bit too charred in some portions which led a few bites to be a little too ashy for the cost of the steaks.  The Lobster Mac'n'Cheese was surprisingly good. It was topped off with a crunchy ingredient to complement the lobster and macaroni which gave the dish an interesting texture.  All of Michael's recommendations were spot on, and he was very friendly and attentive throughout our meal. Michael's co-bartender, Seth was also very friendly. The two also knew many of the patrons by name further demonstrating how friendly they were. The two were also quite knowledgeable of all of the drinks which were available.  If you are in Pittsburgh and looking for a steakhouse or upscale bar, then the Capital Grille would be an appropriate destination."}
{"text":"What a truly wonderful restaurant all the way around. It's rare I feel like I've been \"wowed\" when I go out, but The Captial Grille had that effect and they did so in a way that seemed effortless and second-nature.  We were lured in after the recent Elite event (and actually made our dinner reservations within an hour of the event). The ambiance is exquisite without being extravagant, with many formal-looking portraits, iron, and a wealth of masculine darkly-stained wood.  The kitchen was spot-on during our visit - not a single thing came to the table that wasn't outstanding. We both started with the bacon clam chowder - smokey and rich. My entree was the filet Mignon, a timeless classic (and a personal favorite). I ordered mine medium rare: my first experience in Charlotte where my steak was brought to me a true medium rare. It's a tender cut that the chefs worked wonders with. A had the dry-aged Kona crusted sirloin - his was equally amazing with explosive flavors. Dessert brought chocolate espresso flour-less cake. Exceptionally rich and decadent - the perfect end to the meal.  As an experienced oenophile, I am in heaven at The Capital Grille. The wine selection has no comparison in the area - many, many phenomenal producers represented from around the globe, a survey of the best-of-the-best in wine. We mentioned we had attended for the summer Generous Pour event earlier and paid for it again tonight. This time, though, the server turned it into a guessing game: we'd order one, he'd bring two, seeing if we could identify the mystery wine from the list he recommended with our food.   Speaking of the service, TCG is in a league of their own in the area. The staff, who had or reservation, greeted us by name at the door and at our table. The manager recognized us from the week before and made it a point to stop by and welcome us and to wish us well at the end of the evening. Down to the very smallest detail of folding your napkin if you need to leave the table during your meal, this team embodies every stellar trait of the service industry.  While The Captial Grille is not in the budget for a regular meal (yet), they are now my first choice for a venue to celebrate and to show off everything Charlotte has to offer."}
{"text":"It has been a year since I have started coming here, and I was once again treated to some awesome food, delicious drinks, and excellent service.   Good bread at any steakhouse should be a staple. I had to once again hold back on eating too much as to not get full before my actual meal came out. There was an assortment of piping hot breads that came with sweet cream butter that was topped with some salt. I know it is just \"bread\", but I can eat that bread basket for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Then came the calamari with hot peppers. This was excellent as usual since the calamari was the star of the show. They didn't taste frozen as they were soft and tender, they were coated with a crispy batter that wasn't too thick or heavy, and they had excellent flavor from the peppers. They weren't overly spicy but still had a nice bite. I'm glad they don't come with some type of sauce since, in my opinion, would totally kill the flavor of this awesome appetizer.   Afterwards, my steak came out. I wish I had the words to describe how awesome this steak was, it honestly was one of the best steaks I have had in recent memory. I got the delmonico at a medium-rare, a bone-in ribeye, and I wish I was still eating it as I write this review. It was so juicy, it was so tender, and it had so much flavor. It was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of fat on the edges.   All the accompanying sides that I ordered were a great complimenting addition to my excellent steak. The grilled asparagus was tender and crispy while not being chewy or stringy like asparagus can be. The grilled half lemon that comes with it helps add a bright smokey flavor. The parmesan truffle fries I got were hot, crispy/crunchy and delicious from the first bite to the last. So much so that when I ate the last couple of fries, I almost went into a depressed state of not having any left and actually thought about ordering another order. Then there was the lobster mac and cheese. I have probably eaten this dish over a half dozen times, and it has yet to disappoint. Tender noodles, big chunks of lobster that was in almost in every bite, and a awesome cheese sauce. It was another item that I seriously gave thought to buying a second order of to take home.  My excellent meal was finished with a cheesecake that had fresh berries and a nice caramelized sugar topping. It was a perfect finisher.  The service was top notch as everyone was really friendly. Everything that was ordered came out hot, fresh, and correct. The manager came by to see how everything was doing, and all of the staff in general made my meal very pleasant and memorable.  I like forward to another year of coming here and enjoying impeccable food and service."}
{"text":"I should've known better. I should've asked the second I sat down if they serve USDA Prime beef. Well, didn't have to ask shit once I got my steak. Overly intrusive server didn't help. Service was very awkward, like I was his first table--ever. There were 3 good things about my meal: 1) crab cake 2) wine list 3) potatoes au gratin I doubt I will ever set foot in this place again. The balsamic whatever sirloin was awful. Literally the worst steak I've had in a year or two."}
{"text":"The salmon was perfect with a unique glaze.  The risotto looked really yummy so I'm going to try that next time. This restaurant has a quiet and classy ambiance with Devine food.  Perfect romantic date spot."}
{"text":"1.  Food is absolutely delicious! Everything was cooked as ordered presentation was nice.  2.  Rocco was our waiter and was superb! Honestly, I would go back just to be waited on him. He made us laugh and definitely entertained us. I would definitely request him if YOU go there. I know I will on future dining experiences there.  3.  My kids love crab legs and I didn't have to sit there cracking shells because they take the shell off for them. Yay!  My kids have already expressed wanting to go back.  Lovely place, great people and yummy food!"}
{"text":"Starting with the valet, they never used to charged for it, just tip; now it is $8 dollars plus tip. The restaurant it's already expensive to begin with. I don't like greediness.  Our waiter was not very friendly, just doing his job like a robot, again, for the prices, they should welcome you and smile more.  Never order the coconut cream pie! There is no pie except for a bunch of whip cream!   Also, I know it's a meat place but I think it is of poor taste to have dead animals hanging from their walls like trophies.  I will never go back again."}
{"text":"Upscale but... My wife and I celebrated our 35th anniversary last night at The Capital Grille. The food was excellent. We had both the lobster crab cakes and shrimp cocktail for appetizers. Very delicious. Just the right spice and temperature. For our main course my wife had the salmon and I had the night's special steak. My wife enjoyed her salmon but did have to add salt which I found a bit unusual since she rarely does that. My steak was cooked to perfection and our sides of Sam's mashed potatoes and asparagus were also prepared to our liking. I can find nothing but great things to say about the quality of food. The only thing keeping me from giving me The Capital Grille five stars is the service. It struck us as being rude when we were at the reception station and the host told one of the wait staff to \"go sit these two\". Not really what I was expecting from a place such as this. Our waiter was \"Ok\". Nothing special. He was semi-attentive but as we were having our first sips of our after dinner drinks he brought us the check. Really? Do you want us to leave or do you want us to sit and spend some more money.? It was Halloween and its not like the place was slammed full.  Call me picky but if I am dropping $250 for dinner then I would expect that the service equal my expectations. I do want to give The Capital Grille a big Thank You for going the extra step of setting up our table for our anniversary. My wife was thrilled. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Upon arrival, our party was seated promptly.  The server was very attentive and very helpful with our larger party.  She was able to even able to accommodate extra last minute add-on guests during dinner.    I had the Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin Steak.  It was veryyyy tender and was seasoned to perfection and honestly one of the best steaks I've ever had! My wine glass was never empty. Make sure to try the Lobster Mac and Cheese as well! I would definitely return!  Pros: - Great service and attentiveness with our hostess.   - Amazing steak!  Cons: - None"}
{"text":"Hassle to get into restaurant as Escalator and Elevator at Strip level not working.  Then taking mall elevator to food court and then outside.  Didn't like first seated area as near window overlooking strip with bright lights and table with kids talking loud.   Once moved things got better and Greg Foley excellent waiter.  Appetizers were ok and the Porcini rubbed Bone in ribeye was cooked properly medium rare.   My partners steak was a Porterhouse and was supposed to be med rare but was more medium and chewy.    I let the waiter know and he offered to take it off the bill and comped us a dessert.   Not sure if I would want to pay for fine dining when you're dressed up and have to walk into a mall.  Too much inconvenience."}
{"text":"I was so lucky to get to attend this awesome party!  I have to tell you this place gives customer service a new meaning!  From walking in the door and being greeted to leaving, service was stellar!  I loved JT as a waiter.  When my husband told him I couldn't eat themini tenderloin sandwich he brought him because I have to eat gluten free....I'll be darned if he didn't bring me back my own plate which he'd had the kitchen make me which had no bun and some awesome mushrooms topping it.  He also checked with the chef to make sure it was completely gluten free!  Oh, my!  The drinks were good: Infused peach vodka!  Divine.....with a little raspberry floating in it!  The roasted red pepper soup?  I wanted a gallon of that stuff!  Yum.  Did I mention the plate of tenderloin he brought me was melt in the mouth good?  Foodgasm!  The grapefruit soda which was actually non alcoholic was extremely good, too.  I couldn't eat some of the food due to my gluten free status but what I was able to eat was worthy of a few trips back to walk my way through the menu!  Did I mention the truffle fries?  Excellent party all the way around!  Thank you Capital Grille, Lindsey, Gabi and all for a fantastic afternoon!  Did I mention the very savvy decor?  Or the fact that they opened early for us and nobody else was there?  Impressed!"}
{"text":"A really nice spot for Valentines Day date. Despite the hectic night, we never felt rushed and never lacked for personal attention. The food was great and fairly priced."}
{"text":"Went to the Capital Grille for dinner and ordered a Ribeye. I know it is a steak house, but I ordered the lobster mac n cheese and it was FABULOUS -- best I've ever had! The Ribeye was tasty, but pretty much your run-of-the-mill regular steak. I enjoyed it but wasn't overly impressed. I don't have any complaints and would definitely return here. Although it's a steak house, don't be afraid to stray and order other items, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We were celebrating our 44th in Las Vegas, just booked the Capital Grille because we have never been there, the view looked great and the menu looked good. Our server was Jeff Spivey.  He was an excellent server, one of the best by far.  He made us feel at home and special as we celebrated our anniversary.   The food was excellent.  I had the 22 oz Ribeye, my wife the Filet & Lobster. Both were fantastic and cooked exactly to our preference. The atmosphere was quiet and allowed for great conversation without loud music and background noise. We were both too full for dessert but Jeff insisted that we have a special treat on Capital Grille.  Wow, I'm diabetic but the dessert was fantastic.. I can't think of another word to describe it!  It was delicious.    We will be back on our next visit to Las Vegas.  Again our thanks to Jeff for making it a very special evening."}
{"text":"Excellent service, food and presentation. This location lived up to the Capital Grille reputation in every respect. It happened to be Restaurant Week so that was a nice surprise. The plan was to splurge a bit anyway since we were dining to celebrate my birthday. I had the Kona crusted NY Strip, mashed potatoes, and Lobster Bisque. I also ordered the garlic shrimp as an appetizer. The steak was perfectly prepared and pretty much melted in my mouth. Above all else Capital Grill takes a tremendous amount of pride in their steaks.   The mashed potatoes were excellently seasoned and had some skin mixed in for a nice contrast.  The lobster bisque was smooth, creamy and included a nice amount of lobster meat. I usually don't prefer lobster bisque but this was a very nice change of pace. The shrimp took the cake (what can I say, I love shrimp). They were huge and very filling. Only caveat is the garlic could have been more pronounced. I would suggest mincing as opposed to cloves. All in all it was an excellent meal. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"O.M.G.  I always knew this place was swanky, but now I know that this place is REALLY REALLY swanky!  Hot dang!  ok, ok, let me try to review this before I get any more excited!  Capitale Grille is awesome.  I've known about them the entire 6 years I've lived here, but never made it in.  Why? Because I just haven't, and now I NEED to come back here.    For starters, this event was awesome.  Smaller, intimate set in a great location with top notch food.  The staff here is like no other.  Friendly, classy yet approachable all wrapped into one.  The staff circled with lobster rolls, red and white wine, mini tenderloin sandwiches, coconut cream pies, along with a HUGE shrimp thing that was delicious.  The chef came out and talked about how they age their meats at special temperatures, along with the fact that they always get their meat within a 10 day kill date, so its NOT sitting around forever.  So imformative!  They even had huge slabs of beef out for display!  YUMMY!!!  I cannot brag enough about this event.  The staff here is impressive, food was awesome and Lindsay did a great job planning this event.  Everyone was able to talk, there was plenty of seating, and we could hear each other!  THANK You Lindsay and Gabi for such a wonderful time....YOU GUYS RULE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Always good food and a great atmosphere here. The service was great. The food was fresh and quick. The bread basket and butter is always so yummy. The servers are also so great! Ours was so helpful and made our experience. Good food, good wine, great service - what more could you ask for??"}
{"text":"I was drawn to the restaurant on this evening for the outstanding Pittsburgh Restaurant Week promotion, a one-week event which draws in dozens of fine local establishments.  The Capital Grille offers the best deal and the finest quality of cuisine of the bunch: choice of salad or soup, entree, including three steak choices, side dishes of mashed potatoes and fresh green beans, and creme brulee or flourless chocolate espresso cake for the relatively low price of $35, less than half of what this meal would ordinarily cost.  The bread basket contains an interesting assortment including a matzoh-like item which was delicious and crisp.  The butter pats were soft and an excellent accompaniment to the bread basket choices.  My sirloin steak was delicious, but part of it (ordered medium rare) was raw.    The restaurant is beautiful and comfortable.  My wife and I were provided a spacious booth in a part of the restaurant that was not particularly noisy, though we were forced to wait for a good while despite there being many empty tables and booths when we arrived for our reservation.  I believe the idea is to get customers into the bar with a cocktail before they are seated at a table.  $15 for a delicious, but average-sized martini is profiteering.  I was surprised that there were no draft beers at a restaurant such as this, particularly one which has a large bar.  Our service from Koy was efficient, pleasant, gracious, and delightful.  Unlike the high-pressure tactics employed by our overbearing and overpowering server at Eddie Merlot's in Downtown Pittsburgh recently, Koy did not force us to listen to a lengthy recitation of dishes nor try to force anything on us that we did not want in order to pad the check.  My wife and I enjoyed an excellent evening!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about Michael Fitzgerald that would really convey my appreciation and admiration of his service! I was with a large group of 14 high maintenance women on Feb 17. It's one of those groups that you keep apologizing for because they keep string ordering and want all separate checks!  but Michael didn't skip a beat! There are only a few very rare times in your life that you receive service like this! I was blown away! He had amazing menu knowledge, kindness, humor, and a little bit of swagger! All of the ladies in my group kept talking about how unforgettable the dinner was all week! And these are women who think they're ritzy Southern California ladies!  so they just naturally expect to get what they want. I'm in awe of how well Michael accommodated us! We only had an hour and a half with a group of 14, and he just killed it! I would go back to this location just to repeat the experience! Thank you from the bottom of my heart for turning a stressful weekend into a magical one! I even forgot to mention the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"I struggled with how many stars to give because the food was very good, but unfortunately our server was not. My daughter and I make time to have dinner together at least once every couple of weeks.  We decided on capital grille at the last minute this week and thankfully the patio had availability.   I ordered a nice glass of wine and although he brought the glass right away, it was another 15 minutes before the wine showed up.  We ordered from the restaurant week menu. I had to grab another server to find our server and ask to have our salads. It was literally 45 minutes before the salad showed up.  Just as the salad showed up, so did the rest of our meal.  The other server (not our server) who was bringing our steaks and veggies realized the bad timing and took the steaks back inside. Finally when we were ready for our steaks, they were over cooked.  We both selected the creme brûlée for the dessert and that was unfortunately not very good. Not sure if it just sat too long before they brought it out?   I saw everyone around us on the patio getting great service from other servers.  I did not see our server taking care of any other tables.  I have mixed feelings.  Great atmosphere and it appears there's opportunity for great service. Maybe just our unlucky night? Still undecided if we'll go back. We enjoy fine dining and have no problem paying higher prices for a great meal, but $150 for dinner is disappointing when it's not enjoyable."}
{"text":"First of all, service is five stars. Excellent.    Second, the food was fantastic. To top it all off, the view of the gorgeous wynn and encore was breathtaking.   We went here last night and ordered the Calamari for an appetizer. It was good (not the best i've ever had, but it was good). My boyfriend ordered the Delmonico steak (~$50) which was incredible and I ordered the 2 lb lobster (~$50).   One of the best dinners we have had in a while. Will be back again soon! Thank you so much for the great service and experience."}
{"text":"Cool view of Wynn and encore sunset. Bibb stack salad w strawberries was good. Ahi w rice and wasabi oil was pretty tasty. Cheesecake was good but standard fair. Great service from Charles and staff. Curious to try a steak. Very good mint lemonade, just sour enough."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best dining experiences ever. Between the atmosphere and the impeccable service, not to mention the delicious food. I recommend the scallops and asparagus risotto for this season. From start to finish everything was excellent. This would be a great place for a special birthday or an anniversary."}
{"text":"Capital always does such a nice job, I've honestly never had anything except a great experience here. I normally prefer to sit in the bar/lounge area, but most recently had dinner in the dining room, which turned out to be a better choice bc the bar was PACKED. Our server, Matt, was great- the service was intuitive and playful. He recommended and accommodated as needed. Everything is always delicious, obviously steak is their specialty.... but another highlight is the lobster mac n cheese, its amazing! Also, try the Stoli Doli cocktail, it's their signature. But go easy, it's stronger than it tastes!   All in all, It's a high end chain steakhouse, right, and in a city filled with so many unique & independent places you might not think of Capital, however, it's predictably excellent and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner, with superb service.  Our waiter Taylor provided the perfect combination of being attentive, yet not over bearing.  Even had the valet pull our cars as we settled the tab.  Very nice touch."}
{"text":"Capital Grille again for restaurant week - did not disappoint! Salmon dinner was spot on perfection. Steak - someone in the kitchen is moo managing magician!  Danny our server was charming and very attentive."}
{"text":"In general the ambiance is nice. The decor reminds me of a library, there is a lot of rich wood and nice leather booths. The staff has always been pleasant.  Now that we've discussed the restaurant itself I will talk about my food. I ordered a filet (my usual cut), lobster mac and cheese, and brussels sprouts. First, when the food came out the lobster mac and cheese was only warm, not hot. Next, the filet was COLD. Not warm, cold! It was a bit disappointing. The waiter did not return for quite a while so we decided to just eat the food since we weren't going to be able to make our movie if we waited for him to return. When he did come back, we let him know just as an FYI that the food was cold and maybe they should check the temperature before its brought to the table. He apologized, which was nice and told us to inform him when we come back and he will help us out. It just didn't seem very likely he would remember us or make any other arrangements for us, since they didn't even offer us a dessert or glass of wine for the inferior meal while we were there. I would try again and hopefully next time will be better."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. Every bite was heavenly. The service is impressive. All are so kind and helpful. Be sure to come back!"}
{"text":"Good place for steaks.  They even have an espresso crusted steak and believe it or not, the coffee flavoring goes perfect with grilled beef.  For an appetizer, definitely check out their fried calamari.  Probably the best I've had.  Full bar, cool ambiance, nice view, dress to impress. =)"}
{"text":"Valentines Day/Birthday dinner was spectacular!!! Service food quality everything 5 star. I believe our waitress was Elizabeth and she was just a jewel!! Sweet and attentive. Friend got the Gorgonzola steak (can't remember the cut) it was a chef special. Husband got the NY strip which was excellent. I got the filet with mushrooms (another chef special). Dessert creme brûlée yummm!!! My birthday cheesecake and chocolate flourless cake     Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Fabulous food tbone steak to die for. Ken was the best server ever do ask for him. Also love the homemade croutons.  The cocnut cream pie was amazing."}
{"text":"Awesome place for an anniversary dinner! We made reservations for 9:00pm to come here after our show. We were welcomed to what felt like the best table in the house. Seated in the corner window with views of both sides of the strip right next to us. Amazing!  Our server, Raoul was awesome. Kudos to him. He definitely knows how to make you feel welcomed, friendly and personable. Kept saying sit back and relax. Felt treated like family here. He knew a lot about the menu and made great recommendations for us.  Food was superb. Calamari is always a crowd favorite. But the Lobster mac and cheese is a must! Good size chunks of lobster too. So creamy and goes perfect together while eating steak. For our main course, we decided to get the Delmonico ribeye steak. It was enough for us to share being 22 oz. One of the better steaks I've ever had. Portion sizes are great value. I hate going to fancy places and I can't even see our food! Like where is it?? Haha but this wasn't the case.  I'll definitely recommend this place to anybody!"}
{"text":"WoW! What a great meal we had last night!  The boyfriend and I had date night at Capital Grill last night and also participated in Arizona Restaurant Week. I was excited because they were on the list and only $30. However I wont talk much about the price, as the food was so good, who cares how much is cost. I feel under charged.   I love the location, the Biltmore is my fave! Easy parking, lovely staff and valet, just great. We parked in the metered lot, but you get 2 hours free with validation, easy. The hostess was just adorable, took us on the scenic route to our table; it was very busy at the time so we were avoiding a large party receiving their entrees.   The wine list is extensive, anyone can find something they will love. The prices are very good! We got a bottle of the of an Italian red wine $30, it was great! We each started with a salad, a Cesar and a field green salad. I loved the field greens, the dressing on it was just perfect, peppery and light! He loved his Cesar. Then we both picked the fillet for our entree; to die for. First is was cooked exactly as we asked, and practically melted in my mouth. Delish! They came with mashed potatoes and green beans. Both excellent! Couldn't have made them better!  Then..... my favorite part.... dessert! We got one of each to share; Creme Brule and Flour-less Espresso Chocolate Cake. I could literally eat that Creme Brule everyday of my life and it still wouldn't be enough. Amazeballs! The cake was very tasty, but being a flour-less cake is was incredibly rich, very good though!  The service was excellent! Robert, our waiter, was perfect, right on top of everything, not too pushy, and read our table very well. Thank you Robert!  We had a spectacular time. I would recommend them above all for a steak, date night, dessert, anything!"}
{"text":"A business presentation with guest speakers was conducted in the 'private room', just off the main dining room. Table service was challenged with close quarters as tables & chairs were arranged to face the speaker. Nevertheless, all aspects of the service and fare were notable.  The \"family style\" appetizers of shrimp cocktail and steak tartare were delightfully appropriate. The main course of N.Y. strip steak, accompanied by steamed asparagus and au gratin potatoes harked back to the days of the two martini lunch. (How or why did we ever go back to work?) Water was my beverage of choice and was topped off frequently without interruption. Will be back again soon."}
{"text":"We had the most amazing dinner last night for our anniversary. They had the table set with heart confetti and a lovely handwritten note to mark the occasion. They even had a gluten-free menu ready for me as I have a few dietary restrictions. Our waitress was extremely attentive and helpful.   We both really enjoyed our meal; from the salads we had (Caesar and a field greens) to the main dishes (surf + turf for the husband and sirloin for me) to the sides (grilled asparagus for me and mashed potatoes for the husband). They even brought out a complementary dessert (cheesecake for the husband and raspberry sorbet for me) with happy anniversary stenciled in chocolate.   Highly recommend for a delicious meal and a top notch experience for any celebration (or fun night out)."}
{"text":"I've never had bad food or a bad experience at Capital Grille.  However, it's very pricey so be ready to plop down some serious cash or whip out the plastic with comfortable space between your credit limit and current balance.    The scallops wrapped in bacon are great, as are the garlic mashed potatoes, steak and seafood.  I agree with another reviewer who says to order something other than steak if you want...it will still be tasty.   Tips: - If you work uptown and are having dinner at Capital Grille, leave your car where it is and walk; otherwise, you'll have to pay again to have it parked.  - Reservation is probably a good idea. - Good for company/team dinners."}
{"text":"Great steaks...good desserts even better service!"}
{"text":"Today, I have to raise my review of Capital Grille from 4 to 5 star.  Here is what is going on.....  1.  I eat here at least 6 -8 times a year for dinner, with clients. Easy choice due to my last review details of class, extraordinary service, food quality and reservations.  2.  Last night, I was in \"trouble\" because we were taking my son out for dinner for his 18th birthday with his friends. I was feeling a bit generous as he is doing so well in school, his friends are great and so, we wanted to have something special.  3.  Special meant, on the strip, good view, great food, feeling pampered and special.  4.  I made reservations at the last minute, 5:00 pm for a 7:30 pm dinner. Why, because i needed class and where we were going wasn't special enough.  5.  I asked for a window seat due to my son's birthday. They did not promise, however, they said they would request.  6.  Here is what we got...  a.  Best table seat in the whole restaurant. Right in the corner with great views. b.  A birthday card with a nice touch, a wax seal envelope, that wished my kid happy birthday and thanking him for dining with them. c.  The service was beyond extraordinary. It was simply staggeringly special. d.  The food, was beyond really good. It was just right.  We had the Delmonico (bone in rib eye), the Porcini rubbed Delmonico (dry rubbed porcini finished with a 12 year balsamic dressing), sliced Filet Migon, Calamari, and Prosciutto wrapped Mozzarella as starters.  For sides, we had the Lobster Mac and Cheese, the Au Gratin Potatoes, Truffle Fries and Creamed Spinach.   I guess, when all said and done, the best review is from the young men...\"Best Steak ever\".  OK, while we know that they haven't been to all the best steak places in LV to qualify, the fact is that it was great and I have been to many  steak places in the world.  People, when you are looking for an experience, this is the place.  Kudos to Tiffany for taking my reservation and making it special.  Kudos for Eric who helped us make decisions, and made for a great evening.  Thanks Capital Grill for making our night so great.  It doesn't get better in my book and Happy Birthday son!"}
{"text":"This is a fancy place for special occasions. It's clearly an expensive restaurant, but the quality of food and service matches the price. The filet mignon was perfect; I savored every bite. And for dessert, the flourless chocolate espresso cake was rich, but not overly sweet. I wouldn't go here often, but if I did end up here, I know it would be a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Amazing birthday dinner for my boyfriend with our dearest friends. Robert Carson was our waiter and probably the best waiter I've ever had the pleasure to watch and benefit from! He treated us like long lost friends.  His long fingers and long hands expertly delivered our plates (and his fingers never touched to top of our plates...we look for that). He took our photo with the fabulous desert plate before we devoured everything on it!  Best deserts I've had in a long time (Coconut Cream Pie, Chocolate Cake and, my favorite, Cheesecake). But besides the service and desert, let me praise the beef! All four of us ordered Filet Mignon (one Filet Oscar) and all of us thought it was a prime cut of meat!  The au gratin potatoes (which I haven't eaten in years) was hot, cheesy and wonderful!  Capital Grille ranks up there with Morton's in my book for sure! I'm so glad there's one in the L.A. area...I'll go again next time I have a reason to spend $$$$ on a meal!"}
{"text":"Never dissapointed with this place. You'll want to make a reservation especially if it's for a special occasion. Ask for a window table if you remember because they give you the beat view of the Wynn and the Strip. Gorgonzola N.Y. Strip is my fav.  Their drinks are on point and you'll be warm going into your second one...and I guarantee you'll want a second one...we started in the bar because we came early. Servers are wonderful and willing to get you anything you'd like. This was our date night so we took our time and enjoyed every minute. It's free to park right underneath and you can walk almost anywhere from there...so no parking fees like at the casinos down the Strip!!!"}
{"text":"We sat in the bar when we came I because we had just left a Hornets Game, didn't feel dressy enough the sit in the dinning area. But it was Delicious! Great wine selection, fabulous customer service and down to earth bar tenders, very accommodating."}
{"text":"I went there for dinner.  Very nice ... The food was excellent.  I ordered the bone-in filet with the twice-baked potato ... Perfectly prepared and delicious.  Coconut cream pie was a perfect way to end the meal!!"}
{"text":"This was my first elite event! Very exciting stuff. And you know what?  It totally rocked.  The Capital Grille staff was amazingly friendly, supper accommodating, and really just top notch. The food was so so good.   The tenderloin sliders?!  Are you kidding me,  I couldn't pass them up every time a tray came around I was snatching one up.  And they came around often.  We were fed well at this event. I think my husband had around 17 of the tiny coconut creme pies, I don't blame him.   And since I lost rock paper scissor and got stuck with DD duties for the night, I really appreciated the nonalcoholic options, the grapefruit soda was great.   But it was hard to stay away from their signature drinks they were serving up.    Great event!  Thanks Yelp!  Thanks Lindsey! And Thanks Capital Grille!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick dinner at the Bar... I ordered the Field Greens salad and it was outstanding...The parmesan dressing is a must... Then i ordered the 10oz Filet  Med-rare.. Was very very close to being one of the better Filets i have had... i would recommend ordering up a temperature.. i orderd Med-Rare and it was a true med-rare.. Most people are not used to that at a TRUE steakhouse...Adam the bartender was very attentive.. Over-all i great experience... i will be back soon"}
{"text":"By far the best Capital Grill we have been to. Our bartender, ? Alex, attention to detail. Food was amazing and her unassuming knowledge and recommendations for wine by the glass will be remembered. We were  on a short overnight stay, and just wanted a good relaxing meal at the bar. The perfect martini, along with staff that were professional and not pretentious. Our bartender, who was married to a sommelier, gave us a few pointers on identifying a good wine. This was done in a very genuine humble fashion. When passing through Charlotte we will be back. We were there 3 January 2016 awaiting a new grandchild."}
{"text":"It's a chain, and it's not that close to Glendale.  Not at all what I wanted, nor did I speak up when when Capital Grille was suggested.  I'm a \"go with the flow\" kind of guy and since we were grabbing cabs I knew in an instant that a gin drink was in my near future.  There are Capital Grilles everywhere. LIKE I MEAN EVERYWHERE!  New York, DC, Denver you name it. But my friends love it. Why? Because it isn't Ruth Chris.  Is Ruth Chris a suckfest? No, not ever. But Capital Grille has a way of making each of it's locations a little more unique.  This one has the most uniqueness than ever.  Excellent attentive service. Ketchup with your steak? Sure, they won't judge. Lobster mac n cheese with chunks of lobster you can actually see (without the aid of a microscope), umm yeah and it's good.  Gin martini's? Oh Boy.  I bookmarked a local spot, but ok I walked away feeling like steak greatness was found."}
{"text":"The 10 oz filet mignon was cooked to perfection.  The salad and seafood tower was very fresh.  Dessert was great.  Excellent service!  I didn't have to ask for a single refill or anything."}
{"text":"Severely Overcrowded and they sent half my order to the wrong table.  Normally could forgive such a mistake... but not when you are paying $200 for a so-so steak."}
{"text":"Wow! For a restaurant with multiple locations I'd like to say this is the BEST CAPITAL GRILLED ever. As you may know, I always sit at bars and today Jimmy and Giambrone were GREAT... guided us into picking the right wine for dinner and the most delicious food ever. Highly recommend this restaurant to anyone in Vegas staying at North Strip."}
{"text":"What a terrific experience! The staff really did a bang-up job!  We went in for post-dinner dessert, and were craving bread pudding but they didn't have it on the dessert menu. We ordered the next best thing (flourless chocolate cake with cheesecake... which was delicious), and while we were enjoying our dessert the kitchen staff whipped up an off-menu bread pudding dish and brought it to our table as a surprise. Boo on the additional calories but yay! on the experience (and flavors)... thank you capital grille for showing that you are so much more than a predictable chain experience!"}
{"text":"Service was great, but the food was disappointing.  The waiter suggested the shrimp appetizer, which was very bland with no flavor profile to speak of.  My steak was ok, but also lacked flavor.  My fiance's filet was ordered medium, but the outside was charred to the point it was crispy on the outside.  Very dry!"}
{"text":"Reasonably decent steak place.   A bit on the pricy side, but from what I've heard of downtown Charlotte its decently priced.    Nice folks working there and knowledgeable about food sensitivities.  Decent GF options.    I was there on a business trip and was recommended by my client, but was worth lunch there.    I had steak and mashed potatoes.  The steak was perfectly med-rare and mashed potatoes made simply but flavorful."}
{"text":"Goodness gracious, this place is friggin' amazing.    I wanted to show appreciation by taking my secretary/sounding board/second mother to CG for lunch.  That, and I've been coveting the Ribeye Steak Sandwich ever since Paul C posted Yelp pics.  Paycheck be damned, I was going to have my precious.   We started off lunch with calamari as appetizers, and in the words of Chesney: No sauce, no aioli, no problem.  It's tossed with cherry peppers at just the right ratio where you get the fresh fried calamari kicked up with a little heat.  You won't miss having nothing to dip it in, which turned out to be a plus - it's two seconds quicker that you're scarfing them down.  As for the sandwich, we've all done this in our reviews - \"OMG, like, this filet is soooo good.  Like, I would totes marry it!\" or \"Dat BBQ doe.  I'm in love.\"  This sandwich, however, doesn't warrant such amorous affection.  No, me and this sandwich, we're going for it all - double suicide... so we can be together forever and ever into eternity and infinity.  Caramelized onions, Harvarti cheese, and perfectly medium-cooked steak just hanging out between some pieces of French bread.  Hm, forever might not even be long enough.  My only regret was scheduling a meeting at 1PM forcing us to cut our lunch short.  In fact, I completely lost track of time due to good eats and good co.  Our server could sense my urgency, and quickly handled the pay process with virtually no wait time.  Impeccable service from beginning to end.  Armeen (sp?), the GM, put together one helluva team - glad I finally paid him a visit.  Speaking of paid, lunch was pricey, but well worth it.  So maybe it's a good thing that this was the first time I've been here despite working in the same building for the past three years.  Otherwise, I'd be living out of a cardboard box, taking the Charlotte Trol(LOL)ley, and picking a banjo now in front of Starbucks down the street.  Doesn't sound so bad if you got CG lunches, me thinks.  dmo out."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to Capital Grille cause I came here for HH and the appetizers were fantastic. So I was expecting the same for dinner.   As you walk in the door there is always someone to open the door and welcome you in. I didn't know how to explain the interior but my mom said it the best \"it very masculine\". Dark wood. Everything is fairly dark color in a very high class sort of way if you get my drift.   We started out with the pan fried calamari with hot cherry peppers. I thought this was good. Probably average. Cooked perfectly. Crispy. Good heat with the peppers. Enjoyed it. We also had the lobster & crab cakes. It comes with only two so we split it amongst our table. They had large chunks of lobster and crab but I noticed it didn't have any booming favors. Just good. Not great.   I had the Veal Tomahawk chop and it was about 16oz with a huge bone. I thought it was good. Not great. No wow factor. I enjoyed it. We got the sides of au gratin potatoes, soy Glazed Brussels Sprouts with bacon, and the sautéed Spinach. The potatoes, Brussels sprouts, and Spinach was good. I probably liked the Brussel sprouts the best. It had huge chunks of bacon giving it that saltiness flavor.   My wife ordered the 10oz filet mignon. She though it was okay. She accidentally ask for well done but wished it wasn't. It came out a little dry but that's what she asked. She learned her lesson on that one. It was good. I took it home, warmed it up, added a little moisture to it and it was quite good then.   The rest of my family had the bone-in ribeye and the salmon. Everyone enjoyed it but no one could finish the 22oz ribeye. Leftovers. Yea.   So the service was impeccable. Great service. Glasses were always filled. Our server knew his menu and the manger even came by to check in us. They had people serving all our sides and even our appetizer too. Very nice  So overall, the service was great. Food was good. Not great. I would say a nice steakhouse with an elegant & dark atmosphere. It wasn't loud. Yet it wasn't quite either. We had a good time and we will see if we come back again. Enjoy"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to the Capital Grill expecting good food. What we got was excellent food and a great experience.  Appetizer was lobster and crab cakes. Fabulous flavor with a crisp exterior and tender inside. Sirloin with coffee crusting and sirloin with gorgonzola and cabernet reduction were both great. Roasted brussel sprouts were just right, as well. Took our server's recommendation for wine and had a really good Cabernet.  The manager Dan showed us to our table and came by during the meal to ask us how things were going. It's obvious he cares deeply about the success of his restaurant. Our server Ryan David was both knowledgeable and personable.  Check for appetizer, two sirloin entrees, three glasses of wine, and one vegetable side came to just less than $200. I added a $75 tip to show our appreciation. Next time we're in town we'll make sure to visit them again."}
{"text":"Despite joining a crowded Cleveland food & beverage scene, Capital Grille truly impressed me and my date. The atmosphere was stunning - the interior design was very tasteful and the lighting was on point. I've been to many, many nice restaurants. The only thing separating this from the best of the best is the lack of a signature location/ great view. Legacy Village is nice, but it's still a strip mall. This would be better on a high floor of a building downtown with a view of lake erie. Perhaps in the top of the new Hilton. Unfortunately, Cleveland mostly lacks this combination (Pier W may be an exception).   In any event, highly recommended restaurant. Two pointers - (1) dress code is semiformal (suits for gents and dresses for the ladies is advised) and (2) be prepared for a hefty bill."}
{"text":"This place is just good. I've been here 3-4 times. A good solid American dining experience. David was very knowledgeable and we enjoyed ourselves. This is from almost a year ago. But I've been eating at the Capital grille on and off since 2014. Looking for a good steak, quite intimate setting, definitely go here."}
{"text":"The best time to come here is for lunch.  You are almost guaranteed a table with a terrific view.  In the evening I find it too noisy and over crowed.  They alway have wonderful soups and specials.  In addition to wonderful steaks I fancy their crab cakes and salads.  The wine list is fairly extensive here.  A nice touch-- if you are wearing black they will switch out your napkin so you don't get white lint on your clothes.  Touches like that make a difference.  One huge complaint--no apparent dress code.  I was in for a dinner service once where I was surrounded by people in jeans, sneakers, and baseball caps.  I don't appreciate that.  If I want to sit around and look at tables of people dressed all ghetto I'd have gone to the Peppermill (Not to knock the Peppermill;it can be fun at 4 a.m. when I am super drunk)  At least Ruth's Chris keeps it classy with a dress code."}
{"text":"Came for a late Friday lunch. Sat at the bar and had the house burger - excellent. Top notch service and very cozy seating. Will be back for dinner"}
{"text":"I love this place, I had a phenomenal experience my last time in! The view rocks, the service rocks (kudos to Eric my waiter), the food rocks, and the drinks...ROCK!  Amazing wine list, bottles/half bottles/by the glass, however you want it.  They make a killer dirty martini, including hand stuffed bleu cheese olives - from heaven.     There is baked Parmesan in their assortment of bread along with a warm roll dusted with sesame seeds, I could have made a meal out of the breads.    The wedge salad was huge, easily split between two people, and the Lobster bisque was wonderful.   I did not go down the red meat road, it was Friday during lent season, so I ordered the salmon, and it was another melt in your mouth good.   I would never pass on a meal at this particular location, A+ evening"}
{"text":"Best meal we had in Vegas.  Great service, great view (wonderful windows looking out over the strip, and amazing food.  We had the steak Demonico, grilled asperagus, wedge salad and cobb salad....all delicious."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to Capital Grille.  Reason being one of the few places in Charlotte that offers Dry Aged Steak.  Great service and I had the same waiter that served me previously.  He was knowledgeable in the wine and the menu.  I ordered the Dry Aged Porterhouse steak since it has 2 types of steak in one.  On one side is the tenderloin filet and the other side is the NY Strip Steak.  The steak did not disappoint, but I prefer the NY Steak over the tenderloin filet so I might order just the Dry Aged NY Steak next time I come here.  I also ordered a wine to go with the steak (Hess 2014 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon).  For sides, I order the Lobster Mac and Cheese and the Soy Glazed Brussels Sprout and both were delicious.    Make sure to make a reservation if you plan to dine in at Capital Grille.  You can also valet your car so you don't have to look for parking."}
{"text":"This is my second time and second location for The Capital Grille.  As before I was exceptionally pleased with the experience.  This time I ordered the Steak au Poivre.  I don't normally order sirloin but that is what was on the menu au poivre and I just had to have those wonderful little peppercorns that night.  The cut was fantastic and it was cooked to perfection.  Not a trace of fat to be dissected and just as tender as could be.  I can't remember what it came with just that I liked it.  Sorry, this was several months ago and I'm just writing this now so Yelp will stop suggesting that I do.    The wine list is encyclopedic which does tend to overwhelm me a bit.  I find I like the tablet form of the wine list.  I generally have an idea what I would like and I can just narrow myself down in selections until I come to a more manageable list.  That way I don't have to consult the sommelier and have them realize just how little I know about wine."}
{"text":"Went to Capital Grill with some clients for lunch. We had reservations for 1:30pm, not a lot of people there. I ordered a Plate - clam chowder, lobster roll and truffle fries. Delicious!! It was cold outside, the clam chowder was a great 'first course'.The lobster roll is a sandwich, not a sushi roll. Huge fan of fries! I was my birthday so afterwards the waitress brought out a creme brulee and fourless chocolate cake. If I was not with clients, I would have licked the creme brulee bowl."}
{"text":"Wow just wow!  Dry rub aged porterhouse steak was tender juice and just melted in my mouth.   Desert was unbeatable.   They killed their cheese cake honestly better then cheesecake factort. The only complaint I have was it took forever to get our food."}
{"text":"My husband and I had our 1st week wedding celebration at Capital Grille and the Food and wine were Amazing!!! Shoutout to our very warm and friendly server that night, Mr. Michael Morris, thanks for making our 1st week as husband and wife memorable"}
{"text":"Ruth's Chris. Morton's. Capital Grille. They all have reasons be your favorite steakhouse. I'm a Capital Grille guy. The only better steak I've had was at the Benjamin in NYC. The experience is smooth, warm, clubby, not pretentious at all. It's pricey, but worth it. Have whatever you like. It'll be great."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here to celebrate our 1 year anniversary on a recommendation from one of my friends.. I have to say it's one of the best steak houses we've been too in Phoenix.. We ordered the pan fried calamari with hot peppers which were absolutely delicious.. Then we ordered The Porcini Rubbed Bone-In Ribeye and the porter steak and a side of mashed potatoes.. Both steaks were amazing but both my boyfriend and I enjoyed the porcini rubber bone in ribeye a little bit more.. The ppl who worked there were amazing.. They decorated our table along with getting a free glass of champagne and a sampler of a small chocolate cake and cheese cake complimentary for our anniversary..This place is AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Review on The Capital Grille bar:  The bartenders here know how to make mean drinks, but it's the Stoli Doli that is an absolute must! They even showcase the pineapple slices soaking in vodka right on the counter, it's beautiful as it is refreshingly, delicious! They serve food at the bar, but my favorite appetizer thus far is the Pan-fried Calamari it's the perfect savory, spicy, fried treat to pair with a cool chilled drink!  The service is always great, bartenders are easy to talk to and never pushy. The ambience of the bar is like that of the restaurant, it's dark and laid back. An absolutely great way to spend an evening or for a quick drink."}
{"text":"I've been to The Capital Grille on multiple occasions. I keep coming back because I swear it keeps getting better each time. The food, the service, the venue. Always outstanding! I have never found a single thing that wasn't perfection. (Oh, wait! Yes, I have . . . every single time I have been here, I have eaten too much! Enjoyed it too much! Had too much fun with my dining companions!)   The Capital Grille is definitely on / or near the top of my list of great places to eat in the Valley of the Sun! And, if you've ever spent any time in the greater Phoenix area, you know that there are endless great restaurants all over the Valley! The Capital Grille is definitely one of them!"}
{"text":"My friends and I had dinner here this week. We all ordered from the Restaurant Week menu. We wanted to take advantage of at least one meal during the week and really liked that their menu had multiple options and not just one set meal. I had the wedge salad, 14oz bone in strip, green beans, mashed potatoes, and finished with cheesecake. Everything was very good. I can't say the steak was mind blowing but it was good. My favorite thing that I ate had to be the potatoes. They were creamy yet still had some skins in them. I could have ate the entire bowl myself. I probably wouldn't rush back but I would dine here again."}
{"text":"I gave the Capital Grille 4 stars because of 3 things: Excellent Service, Delicious garlic shrimp appetizer  (I took a piece of bread and made sure to get all the sauce on the plate) , and last but definitely the star of my dinner experience The Chocolate Cake with in house vanilla ice cream.  I seriously think they bake them as orders are received bc it was like a warm , fresh , chocolate party in my mouth .   Now, why not 5stars ? Shockingly if it wasn't for the grand finale of the dessert, I think I would've given 3 stars . I was very disappointed with our steaks, one bone in NY STRIP, the other Bone in Ribeye , I requested medium and It came out medium well , had a hard time cutting it, not as tender as I would have liked and I wanted to ask for steak sauce .  Maybe the boneless Rib eye would've been better? Where was the fat ... we all know a good Ribeye will have some fat on it , that's the flavor . Oh well , the appetizer and dessert alone will bring me back."}
{"text":"We are at capital grill pretty much every other weekend, we only ever get served by Marc Hall and Danny Kray - they are truly the best servers and give you the best restaurant experience. With servers like Marc and Danny we will forever be guests and bring our friends/families to receive the same experience we get. Nick the GM is also very welcoming and friendly, we Thank you for all you guys do to make Capital one of our favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"I will set the scene: my boyfriend and I were dressed rather dapperly. We were both excited to celebrate and feast upon a delectable meal in order to properly commemorate his accomplishments at work.   Before my last visit to Capital Grille I must say I had high expectations of quality premium food with competent, formal, and a little detached service. That's why I was dismayed to have the experience that we did that fateful Friday. We arrived to the ambient restaurant and were quickly seated in a booth. Our waiter was both very competent and very detached (expectations met) Perfect. We ordered our beverages and took the waiter up on one of the the specials being offered that night . . . Filet and (dun, dun, dun) rock lobster.   They brought out the appetizer which we devoured with much vigor. In proper order our main course arrived. We plunged into partaking in the gourmet bounty and must say we enjoyed the tender, perfectly cooked filet first as we both wanted to save the 'best' part of the meal for last. Finally I worked my way to the large lobster tail and cut off a big piece, dipped it into the warm butter and popped it into my mouth. . . to my dismay it was a lot chewier and much more rubbery than lobster should be. I then turned to my handsome date and asked him how his lobster was. He hadn't tried it yet but he did at my bequest and found it also to be 'off'. Now I must inform the reader that I am a seafood aficionado. I've single handedly caught and cooked the freshest quality seafood and knew immediately that this lobster was not done. I sliced the lobster down the middle and saw that it was indeed raw and cold.   My gallant boyfriend waved the waiter over and explained the issue. The waiter  took the lobsters away (to the rubbish bin I assumed) with a murmur of apology. The manager came over and apologized which was nice, though a complimentary drink would have been nicer (wink, wink). Then the waiter came out with THE SAME EXACT TAILS WE'D SENT BACK! This time presumably without dangerous pathogens. I must say for a classy joint I was surprised they would reheat  undercooked seafood.   We ate what we could of the tails, which in hindsight was a huge mistake. That night we spent quality time together in the bathroom rubbing the others back as we took turns violently dispensing the rock lobster into the porcelain bowl. Oye vey! The point I want to make if you're still reading, is NOT to eat reheated seafood. No matter how fancy the place is."}
{"text":"Went for winter restaurant week for the 3 course deal for $16. I have wanted to try this place for a while but the prices have scared me away reserving it possibly for only special occasions. But even then I didn't want it to be a letdown once I did finally get there. When I saw this deal I couldn't pass it up for a chance to try the food.  I got the wedge salad, steak with arugula salad, and chocolate cake special. It was amazing. I usually don't like wedge salads  (I think they are lazy...why are you making me do the work, just cut up my salad...)  but this one was delicious. The bacon on it was awesome and the dressing was freshly made. The steak was done exactly how I asked for it, and it was one of the best steaks I have ever had. The chocolate cake was gluten free and was really decadent, rich, and smooth almost like fudge. I could have used more whipped cream and raspberry sauce, but overall it was delicious. I will definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"We came here last night for my husband's birthday. They made him feel very special, we had a great time. Service was fantastic all around. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"What a great place very pricy but well worth it , we had steaks and salad desert and a nice bottle of wine spent over 300.00 for 3 people however just wonderful"}
{"text":"I have gone to Capital Grille over the years in other locations and have always had a nice experience but the Biltmore location gets a \"D\" in my book!!!! The bar area and bartender were friendly and attentive :) so that part was great! The dining experience was TERRIBLE!!!!  The waiter was not only very rude, he constantly forgot simple things and was totally unattentive... so after 5 things and 2 hrs into dinner we requested the manager who was just the same and sarcastic on top of everything else! For a $300.00 meal that was average at best. Thank goodness the company I was with was wonderful!!!! Too many other choices to be treated the way we were :( I was so disappointed that I wrote corporate headquarters! To be continued when I hear back from them!!!!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best restaurant to go to in Vegas. I went here with my sister for lunch and it was awesome! I'm very much into a place with a great atmosphere so this was perfect. The view was the best money can buy and we sat right next to the window. You can see the whole strip -as you should- since you are high above it and the windows were endless with high ceilings. The service was as if we had our own personal butler and the food was very delicious. We ordered calamari as an appetizer and we shared 2 entrees: a steak and a salad. Both were amazing! My sister took care of the bill so I'm not sure how steep it was, but it's Vegas...you're supposed to spend money!"}
{"text":"Let me start off my saying the service was fantastic! The food on the other hand, not so much. I dined with 3 other people so celebrate my recent engagement. When I got my Kona crusted steak which I ordered medium, it was medium well, if not well done. Another person at the table ordered his strip medium rare, and got a medium well steak. We also ordered Brussel sprouts that came out completely burned. All black crisp, no veggie left. The manager came over and offered to redo the steaks. When he came back out with another for me, it was not only half the size of the first one, this one was completely well done. it looked like a charred brick. I cut it in front of the manager who went \"woooops.\" He offered to remake it again and I declined. I have been to other capital grills and the food as been fantastic. This one, needs to up it's game. I know it is newly opened, but they need to help the chefs understand how to properly cook a steak. I most likely will not go back."}
{"text":"On Sun/9 Jun at about 9 pm I was here with 2 buddies, and the 2 kids of one of the buddies:  Cons: - $10 for \"Field Greens, Tomatoes, and Fresh Herbs\" salad which turned out to be a pitiful looking plate of iceberg lettuce and two cherry tomatoes that were cut in half.   My salad contained no herbs other than what was in the vinaigrette dressing I had on the side.  Capital Grille should rename it the \"Iceberg Lettuce and Tomatoes\" salad.   - My 2 buddies had each ordered soup with their fish entrees.  Both buddies said that the waiter had made it seem that the $11/soup would be complimentary (since it was our first time eating at Capital Grille or whatever).  I wasn't paying attention to what the waiter said when he was discussing the menu, but I'll side with both of my friends (word of my 2 friends vs. the word of 1 waiter) who say they were mislead into ordering the soup.  Had my friends known it wasn't complimentary, they wouldn't have bothered ordering the soup.  Pros: - Great location overlooking the northern end of the Strip. - Aside from the soup problem, the service was great. - Fancy decor, nice ambiance."}
{"text":"-This time I had the Gorgonzola and Truffle Crusted Dry Aged NY Strip Steak w/a cherry Cabernet reduction. The steak was cooked perfectly rare and was of prime quality.  -Service is always at its finest -Lobster Mac and a la carte sides are all excellent -Cap Grille is overall an exquisite, reliable experience"}
{"text":"While some of the people that dine at the Capital Grille may be pretentious, I think it's still a great place to go for a special dinner now and then.  The prices are high, but the food is fantastic.  I recommend the lobster and crab cakes or the calamari for an appetizer, the seared tuna or the lobster for dinner and the coconut cream pie or the crme brulee for dessert, all are amazing.  I know most people think of steaks when they think of Capital Grille, but I can't attest to them.  If you can force yourself to veer away from steaks when you dine here, they have excellent seafood!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on Valentine's Day and I have to say that I was pretty disappointed. This steakhouse is overpriced for the quality. In comparison to Morton's, Steak 44, and other steakhouses in the same price range, this one REALLY lacked in quality. For the same price, I know that I could get a spectacular meal elsewhere.   The only thing I really liked about here was the assorted bread basket that they give you. I ordered a medium New York with shallot butter. The meat was tough and my steak was medium well. We also ordered scalloped potatoes and brussels sprouts, which were decent and actually pretty cheap. There was nothing special about the food, and I felt that it lacked flavor (especially my steak).   As for the ambiance, it's a little like Morton's but I absolute ABHOR the ugly jackets worn by the wait staff. It seriously makes this place look so tacky and cheap. The jackets (if you've never seen them) are like tan/khaki and loose-fitting. Seriously I could not get over how unappealing these jackets were for my entire meal. Service was okay, not great like you would expect elsewhere.  All in all, nothing went awfully wrong but I was definitely NOT happy leaving this place on Valentine's Day when I expect food and service that is actually good. Instead I got below mediocre for a fat price tag."}
{"text":"I have eaten at some exceptional restaurants and Capital Grille has just made this list. I liked the ambiance and the decor. The service was top notch and the food exceptional. Now granted I came during Charlotte's Restaurant Week but it's a restaurant I would try again even if it wasn't restaurant week. I got the chef's special which was the bone-in Kona crusted dry aged 18 oz NY strip topped with a shallot butter sauce. It was cooked a gorgeous medium rare. Buttery and smooth. The sauce was heavenly. I also ordered a delicious wedge salad and the creme brûlée was fantastic. The sides were green beans with onions and heirloom tomatoes and mashed potatoes. Both good but I was really focused on my steak. Peter was a great server and recommended a delicious house martini that complimented my meal. Do yourself a favor and make reservations today."}
{"text":"Again, I have to say this place is fantastic.  I love the staff, the service, and of course the food. Calamari, Lobster, Crab, and yes, fries. All great. And the service is always just about enough. There are places where you'd rather they stop coming but here, they know when you need them.  So, I gave'hem a great review last time on their Exchange Room and Filet Mignon. Now, I must recommend that you eat out in the sun as well. Yes, they have tables in the shade as well."}
{"text":"I've had the opportunity to dine in many steakhouses over my 35 years in sales, traveling nationally. This place is very nice to look at and has attentive and professional staff. The appetizers,salads,deserts were wonderful.The problem is, the steaks are really not very good. It's like seeing the understudy at a Broadway show. Yeah you get the message, but not the show as originally intended. The meat is so overtrimmed that it's as if it was manufactured not cut from a real once living creature. Maybe try the numerous fish offerings or other cuts of meat, but the steak-ugh."}
{"text":"Came to a holiday party here. The wait staff was top notch and very fast and friendly.  Banquet room was beautiful. Our event was a great deal of fun. As a vegetarian I typically don't expect much out of planned menus. This was even less than lowered expectations. The soup was clam chowder, no plain salad options. Not offered when I indicated why I couldn't eat the soup. So skip that. The \"vegetarian\" options was a  \"chef's vegetarian selection\". So of course I inquired... Yep described as \"a big pile of grilled vegetables\" hummm... So no sides? Just plop a pile and call it a day?  Wow. Impressive. I can skip that. Chocolate cake? Ok I'm down, ordered coffee both very tasty"}
{"text":"OMG what a fantastic restaurant !!!!! We happen to be at a conferance so we had around 10 people in our group they were very accommodating especially since we happen to be one of probably 10 groups of 10 or more people in the place .. Just a big shout out they had it on the ball they had several people helping all the waiters and waitresses great management team !!!! As for the food again WOW we had Several appetizers the mixed seafood ,Proscuitto wrapped mozzarella they were fantastic the flavors were wonderful. The dinner crazy big we had bone-in filet ,some of us had Tomahawk ribeye with lobster tail the food was big and bold .. i would recommend if you are planning on making a trip to Vegas and eating here  make a reservation in advance as they get extremely busy ..Kudos to the entire TEAM at The Capital Grille thank you for a wonderful visit ..."}
{"text":"Giving these guys a four for effort, but I'm not a huge fan of this type place.  Super expensive, great service and they assault you with tons of  food that's not terribly unique though it's well prepared and good quality.  Went there for 30th anniversary dinner - told them about it, so they had a sign on the table and little hearts, etc.   Nice touches.  Before we got going on anything, they gave us a complimentary little champagne glass for a toast.  I'd been to CG before, my wife hadn't, I love the calamari, it's well done.  We had that, each got a steak, and a couple sides.  My steak was decent, a good steak, but nothing I couldn't make at home.  My wife's was a strip steak with a coffee rub, that just didn't taste good.  It was prepared to the right doneness, but was tough, and didn't taste like coffee, or even good steak.  We complained, they told us sorry, offered a re-do, we said no, they said 'if you didn't love it, you shouldn't pay for it' - so spot on, they did what they should do.   So after that they gave us dessert for nothing though we told them we didn't want dessert, so props to them for going the extra mile.  Of course we ate some of this dessert and it was pretty good!  We walked out with multiple doggie bags as the sides are so huge too.  My wife and I are not small people, but they give you way too much food at this place, and I have trouble paying fifty dollars for a steak a la carte, that doesn't make you swoon when you eat it.  So, I will probably do this again on expense account with customers but if it's on my nickel, for the same price I'll go somewhere else, and get a really unique meal with reasonable portions...."}
{"text":"We visited during restaurant week and one thing to note is the service was outstanding. She was awesome, attentive, helpful and don't find service like this much. Overall the food was good. We got salads to start, nothing special what you would expect for a Caesar salad. The filet was good but could have been a little more tender. I find many steak restaurants have an issue cooking to med-well. It was good just not great. The side were really good, we got potatoes, beans and man & cheese. The mac & cheese is to die for...awesome!! Desserts were good, the chocolate flourless cake was great but super rich. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"As I've said a few times in other reviews, my Partner In Cuisine and I really try to avoid corporate restaurants, but the Capital Grille is a rare exception and it earns itself five stars.  Perhaps I am a bit biased because my one and only experience here was on my birthday, but given the exceptional level of service and food, I can't bring myself to give anything less.  The PIC went to great lengths to make my birthday dinner a special surprise after I had mentioned hankering for a good steak.  We arrived at the restaurant and were greeted immediately by not one, not two, but three people.  We were seated at a cozy little out of the way booth which had been set up with a tasteful sprinkling of birthday confetti.  I got my favorite drink from the bar (amaretto sour) which had been generously portioned with amaratto and before too long, we were getting a variety of breads to munch on.  The PIC had ordered our food before arriving so it wasn't even 10 minutes before I was looking at a delicious NY Strip (my favorite) and his filet as well as the most exquisite macaroni and cheese.  We ate everything!  After dinner, I received a complimentary cup of coffee and creme brulee which I shared with the PIC.  We left feeling fat and happy.  I feel that the wait staff really went to great lengths to make me feel special on my birthday.  Of course I'd go back again, but I think this is a place best kept for special occassions because it is NOT cheap (I stole a peek at the bill!)."}
{"text":"Nice high end restaurant good for business lunch/dinner or a romantic date, or, heck, if you just feel like indulging in some good old American food, assuming your wallet would allow it. Was there last night for a business dinner and sat by the window with some nice view, even though it's not located very high up in the building. It's sitting across from the shopping center so you can also get some shopping done afterwards to walk off the rich meal.  Too bad I didn't snap any pictures, but this was a work dinner and I had to behave...  Everyone else ordered some sort of steak dish except for me. I got the citric glazed salmon, which was juicy, medium rare and cooked perfectly. The steak dishes are pricey but the portions were actually not very huge. Everyone finished all their meat so apparently they were all happy with how their steak was cooked. I did get to taste their beef as I ordered the steak tartar appetizer and it was fresh and tender and seasoned well too.  We also shared fried calamari, lobster macaroni (yum!), steak tartar and grilled asparagus (bland). Loved the warm bread basket before the meal. Fancy decor (classic dark wood) and we shared a bottle of 2009 red wine from Napa.  The chef sent us three yummy desserts even though we didn't order any: cheesecake (rich and just the right amount of tartness to balance the sweetness), chocolate ganache cake (smooth, deep, chocolaty) and creame brulee (light and fresh custard) with assorted berries. I only have one word for all three desserts: PERFECTION. Not bad if you have a friend who knows the chef. Again I wish I had taken a photo. .."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Trump, across the street from the mall. We wanted to eat close by, which meant the mall. And luckily for us, the Capital Grille is the fanciest place to eat at the mall.   It's got a great view of the Wynn and the strip, and at lunch, this place is full of power lunchers. I think my friend and I were the only two not dressed in suits, but that did not at all mean we experienced any subpar service.   We split steak tartare - I looooove the preparation here. And it takes some time because they chop it up fresh for you! I won't give it away, but there are pictures...   I had the lobster salad for lunch. I just couldn't handle more meat after the indulgent weekend I had. But it was still indulgent, for seafood. My friend had the steak cobb. And it was perfect - the steak was basically on the side. If I had known that, it would've been what I ordered. Just a little bit of steak, with a bit of salad (and avocado, blue cheese WEDGE, all the good cobb stuff).   Capital Grille Strawberries for dessert. A perfect sendoff from Vegas!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food, drinks and atmosphere in spite of the sky-high prices."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best steak I've ever had. The service is outstanding and though some may find it expensive, the quality of the food makes it well worth the price. If you are in downtown Pittsburgh, this is a place you definitely have to try. If you are a foodie like we are, you can't miss this place."}
{"text":"The steak au povie is outstanding...service excellent & comfotrtable seating...love the I-pad wine menu...great idea ...been to 3 other Capital Grilles and they never disappoint"}
{"text":"WOW, this place is awesome. I was taken here for my birthday last year and wow was I impressed, they even took the extra effort to give me a birthday card that was closed with a seal.  I had a steak with wild mushrooms and it was definitely one of the best steaks I've ever had.  I would come back here without thinking twice."}
{"text":"Went for 3rd year anniversary with my husband.  Had a 5:00 reservation.  Arrived about 10 minutes early and we were greeted by young hostesses with heavy make-up and just okay.  We were happy to sit in the beautiful bar (entire place is decorated wonderfully - music was upbeat, young and pretty loud).  Cops was on in the bar.  Our tender was fun.  Ordered martinis straight up, with GREAT blue cheese olives.  Good service at bar.  Got served some cold bread in a basket.  Nice variety.  But cold!  We sat there for over 20 minutes though.  Wished to be seated at table on time.  Table was nice.  Servers and bussers do shuffle around and don't seem happy.  Our server was fine.  We dine at Ruth's a lot so we were happy to try a bone-in rib-eye here.  We were told that we'd find the steaks at PCG better.  Didn't turn out that way and not just because of overdone.   Another bread basket but this time it was hot.  Love the pretzle bread with big salt crystals.    Interesting that we didn't even open the menu.  What the server sugggested was what my hus. decided sounded great.  I agreed.  Nice red wine.  Lobster bisque came out pretty fast.  It was tepid.  Yuck!  Flavor was nice, lobster morsles good.  Temperature - awful!  The giant crouton it came with (same kind as bread basket) made it better.  Not enough flavor.  Just seemed to be creamy for creamy's sake.  Just a bowl of heavy cream.  Heirloom tomato salad was good but the dressing was just alright.  Nice variety of tomatoes.  Was hoping for more pizazz.    Potato Au Gratin were heavily salted.  Sliced thinkly, good texture, but I like the simplicity of Ruth's potatoes better.  They were very tasty, but maybe just a little too salty.  I like to salt my own.  Neat, but not necessay to have an extra server scoop out a serving of potatoes.  No personality when doing it.    Our steaks were ordered meduim-rare.  They came out meduim.  The server asked, noticed, took out flashlight and agreed that they were both overdone.  My hus. kept his.  Hungry is his name (not really).  My new one came out pretty fast.  With my new one, came manager.  Man, was he stuffy!  He had his flashlight too and said for me to cut into it so that HE could be sure that I'd be happy with this one.  Well, it was rare, but I, too was hungry so I kept it.  I was happy to warm it up later in the broiler and then it'd be perfect.    The meat itself was great.  Not salted or peppered at all.  Not much butter.  I love Ruth's WAY better.  I like the butter, salt and sizzle.  Server comped steaks and gave us desset to go.  Overall, all our needs met.  Happy time!  Just prob. won't go back for steaks.  Ruth's and Hillstone are MUCH better."}
{"text":"The Capital Grille is incredible. We decided to go here for a special occasion and were thrilled with not only the service but the food. The lobster bisque was so good we have even discussed sneaking in tupperwear and ordering enough for 6 people to take extra servings home (we wouldn't really, but it is THAT good!). We had the seafood tower as well and it was stunning. The tower itself was beautiful and the seafood was wonderful. We split the aged ribeye and it was phenomenal and plenty for 2 people.   We will be returning again for our next special occasion."}
{"text":"Restaurant Week Stop #1..........The Capital Grille : Lunch : $30.13   First Course : Field Greens, Seasonal Vegetables With Shallot Champagne Vinaigrette OR Clam Chowder   Clam chowder was good!  Not great, but good!   Second Course : Dry Aged Sirloin With Roasted Pepper, Fresh Mozzarella And Arugula Salad OR The Grille's Signature Cheeseburger With Parmesan Truffle Fries OR Seared Citrus Glazed Salmon OR Caesar Salad With Roasted Chicken Breast And Parmesan Tuile   It's one of the best burgers in Vegas IMO....and you know I have a high standard in burgers! Cooked perfectly medium rare, with the juices hitting the plate even before the initial bite. The horseradish sauce is very subtle but adds a nice touch to a very well seasoned burger. Not sure if they use aged meat, but it tastes like it! Truffle fries are good but not great....a little light with the truffle oil.   The aged steak was ok...didn't have the punch most aged steaks have imo.  It was cooked well, but didn't have the flavor explosions goin on in each bite.  The salad was pretty good surprisingly, since I don't usually eat the greens :P   Third Course : Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake OR Creme Brulee OR The Capital Grille Handcrafted Ice Cream OR Chef's Seasonal Fruit Sorbet   Chocolate Cake was super rich and thick but tasty!  I really liked the creme brulee...pretty tasty and fresh fruit was piled all over on top!  Service and atmosphere was excellent!  It's very classy without feeling stuffy.   Worth every penny for RW...do it!"}
{"text":"Love bar area and bartenders friendly. As for food? Locally owned and waaay less expensive places have better food. Salmon the other night tasted too fishy and I am a salmon lover so I know! Service was so so. Could have been better! I can make a better steak at home too."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here two weeks ago before seeing \"Wicked\" at the Benedum Center. It's not a place we would normally do dinner unless it's a special occasion. However, since our tickets to the show coincided with Pittsburgh Restaurant Week, we decided to give it a try/see how the other half lives!  We were running a little late, so I called to let the restaurant know and was told they could hold the reservation for 15 minutes. When we arrived, were were seated in one of the smaller dining rooms off to the side, with only six tables in it. The atmosphere was not what I expected, with interesting art choices. A huge picture of August Wilson was basically at the table with us, while a painting of cows in a pasture hung across the way and the counter had a strange, brass statue of a falcon. It was museum-esque, almost suffocating. The room was a little too dim for my boyfriend, who doesn't have the best eyesight.  Although I did like that the tiny, battery operated lamps at each table. I wanted to take one home! The rest of the restaurant and bar area seemed more lively and upbeat, so if we go back I would request to sit in the larger, main dining area.   One thing that really bothered me was what happened when we were seated. The gentleman brought us to the table and, as he presented us with the special Restaurant Week Menu, said \"This menu is a great deal, we usually average over $100 per head,\" and then he left. His tone was condescending and it made me feel uncomfortable, like I should have felt privileged to be there. It's expensive, dude, I get it.   Our server, however, was fabulous. He was knowledgeable and attentive without hovering. The server's assistant, who was also serving our room, was also very polite and kept our water glasses full the entire night--even though we didn't order the fancy cucumber Fiji water like the table across from us. However, I think the uniforms/chef coat things they have their servers and other waitstaff wear are just weird, it didn't really seem to fit the who high-class, 1% vibe they had going on.  On to the food! Nom! We each started with a Caesar Salad, which was small, but delightful. The dressing was good, as were the Parmesan croutons. For the entrees, I chose the Seared Citrus Glazed Salmon and my boyfriend got the Bone-In Dry Aged Sirloin Steak (14oz). My salmon was very good, but the real star of the night was the steak. It was seasoned and cooked beautifully, and I had never been more jealous of my partner. (He was nice enough to share a few pieces, though. He's a sweetheart!) With the entrees, we were served sides family style, Sam's Mashed Potatoes and Fresh Green Beans. The green beans were just \"eh,\" but the mashed potatoes were some of the best I've had in a long time. Seriously, so good. When it came time to get dessert, we were slightly bummed as there were only two selections (Flour-less Chocolate Espresso Cake or Cheesecake with Fresh Berries) , while the website said there would be more options. I don't know if this is the fault of the restaurant or the folks who run the Pittsburgh Restaurant Week site. We both went for the cheesecake, but it turned out they had just run out. To our delight, our server allowed us to each get an order of their Classic Crème Brulee, which was also quite delicious. Next time, I really want to try the Strawberries Capital Grille! They sound phenomenal.   Wine! The wine list they have here is ridiculous. It is so long! So. Long. It's about 25 times the size of their normal dinner menu. We ordered a white blend that we shared during dinner and it was good.  Overall, our experience was nice. That steak. That steak gets 5 stars! As does the service we received from our waiter. I couldn't give the restaurant 5 stars though, because I was put off my the gentleman that seated us and by the atmosphere in the small dining room. I really felt like I needed to whisper, which is hard because I cannot whisper to save my life. I would possibly come here again for a special night out. And maybe this time, I will ask about getting one of those adorable little lamps!"}
{"text":"Great dinner with my family. Especially my son just returned from Navy college and was very happy to noticed a welcome card made by the staffs. I love their porterhouse and delmonico ribeye.  My hotel executive secretary was very impressed of the   chocolate cake and we had a great time !"}
{"text":"Came here at 4:00pm right when they opened for the non existent happy hour. I really just wanted the bar menu, I'm not drinking these days.  I proceeded to ask for water, she poured liquid imported from Fiji. I felt important and rich.  She apologized profusely for not having hot bread from the oven... it's okay the butter made up for it... if it's rude to eat butter right off the plate into your mouth then I guess he who has the gold makes the rules.  She- the bartender didn't really socialize I was the only person there until I was almost done.  I ordered- Wedge salad and burger. She offered me choices on fries- who passes up truffled fries?  Burger ordered rare... I like rare, this was fully raw except for a teeny bit of crust which was so good but did give me a bit of a stomach ache later.  Salad was amazing Crunchy crackers were awesome Burger was HUGE well worth the $18 price, but alas I could not finish it and since I was at the Courtyard I had no fridge to take it home to save Fries were very good  Because I was the only one there my food came out too fast for me  Finally as I was wrapping up the bartender decided to be social with me... too little too late my dear, please validate my token and I will be on my way.  Super fabulous place to go and contemplate fine chain dining, I will of course return anytime I am in the area at dinner.  I highly recommend it. I've also eaten in the main dining room and it is flawless."}
{"text":"The martinis are great.  Love em.  Love the Onion Soup.  Everything was great, as it is each time I go there."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place and the menu seemed great going into it, BUT. The experience was very disorganized and at times bizarre. Our server for the evening was training but he did a fine job, and the server that he was team serving with tried and had a pleasant and helpful attitude. Having said that, we had our bread taken by a bus boy to the table opposite ours in the bar area and later we received a mysterious 'celebration platter' dessert after ordering unrelated desserts.  It became obvious in spite of our servers trying to play it off that it belonged at the table that had our bread.  The food: We began with the calamari which was excellent. Light prep, cooked just right, spicy and tasty. Wedge salad was standard, bleu cheese dressing was especially good. I had the Gorgonzola strip steak which would have been better had it not been really too rare for medium rare (I usually don't mind, but it was cold and red in the middle). It was also quite tough, not sure why. My husband's ribeye on the other hand was cooked at least to medium when he also ordered medium rare. If you're spending like $50 a steak there should be NO ISSUES WITH THE DONENESS. The mashed potatoes had a great flavor but they were like a tub paste consistency. The creamed spinach was unremarkable, not much to say about it. The cheesecake I eventually got was some of the best I've had; very light as far as cheesecake goes and the berry sauce and berries were excellent.  Overall we felt put out to spend $250 on a somewhat scattered experience where the steaks were the weakest item. I'm wondering if we give it some time before we try it again it might improve since it just opened, but not sure we feel like taking the chance."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to hold a bridal shower and wow--this is not the place! I don't usually YELP bad experiences but when the burned burger taste lingered in my mouth long after I left... I felt compelled.  I had the worst char-burned burger that perhaps you'd expect at a picnic in the park for someone cooking for 100 people. I thought it was the bun but  after politely pointing at my plate, Oscar brought me a slightly warmed fresh bun but I realized it wasn't just the bun it was the burger, despite requesting medium rare. I asked Oscar what vegetable he recommended, so I got the sautéed spinach and it was nothing extraordinaire, perhaps greasy topped with three garlic cloves. I also waited for ketchup and mustard which took two trips. My bill came to $19+ for burger which came with side dish and water. I'll keep looking for a spot to have a party."}
{"text":"I was invited back to dine at Capital Grille by management and after a little over a week or so of deliberating, JD convinced me to go back for lunch.   Our server was Charles and he was fantastic. He was attentive without being pushy and I always appreciate that. Super low key, much like us. So it was a great fit. We were deliberating between the oysters or tuna tartare and he suggested the tartare. It didn't disappoint! The fish was fresh and I really enjoyed the mango purée that accompanied it.   I had the lobster salad again and man, I LOVE that salad. There are always huge chunks of fresh lobster. At first glance, it may look fairly small. Once deconstructed, you realize just how huge it is. I always manage to finish it though. It's too good to try to save any for leftovers!   JD ordered Charles personal favorite, the steak sandwich. He and I were both VERY impressed with the size of it. Gigantic. The steak was cooked perfectly to order-- medium rare. He actually had trouble finishing it as well, which is a rarity for him. The fries were crisp and the Parmesan is a nice touch.   Charles went above and beyond for me by putting some jasmine green tea on ice for me, which normally is served hot. It was refreshing and exactly what I was looking for.   +2 because Charles was really great and made it such a pleasant experience from start to almost finish.   -1 because Drew came out to speak to us at the end of our meal and still had the same arrogant demeanor about him."}
{"text":"Amazing for a chain!  Came here with two colleagues to take advantage of their \"plates\" lunch special.  This is actually a great deal where you can order a soup or salad, sandwich and a side.  There's only three options for each category.  I had a salad, steak sandwich and truffle fries.  My two colleagues soup instead of the salad. I had a simple field greens salad which was standard.  The sandwich was delicious and I had it done medium well which was perfect.  The truffle fries were delicious as well! My colleagues all enjoyed their food.  One of my colleagues had the lobster bisque which had generous chunks of lobster.  Service was great and though I enjoyed the food, this really is more of a business lunch or dinner place."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic and service was outstanding. Michael, our server was GREAT! He handled our large group with ease and professionalism. My group can be more than difficult at times and he was patient, kind, and prompt. He made our experience great."}
{"text":"Thank you for making our anniversary so memorable. From the moment we walked in, every staff member was courteous and took a genuine interest providing great service. There were great little touches like the complimentary glasses of champagne and a special anniversary dessert that made our experience go from great to exceptional. My filet was absolutely perfect and the lobster macaroni was decadent. I was thoroughly wowed!"}
{"text":"We ordered the steak carpaccio for appetizer.wifey had filet mignon and I had the delmonico bone in rib eye. Our sides were cream corn with bacon and mash potatoes.  Great meal great service..Steak was so good we didn't need any type of sauce the cream corn with bacon was really good..thank you for a great experience"}
{"text":"Superb execution.  I believe Smith & Wollensky went under or moved out on the strip years ago and next to Capital Grille any Smith & Wollensky is a 2nd trimester pre-natal boy in a Capital Grille MAN's game...Joe's Prime Steak & Stone Crab in Seizures Palace is really the only Las Vegas strip outfit that can compete in this segment, in my opinion.  This Capital Grille location is superb.  I think Del Frisco's off-strip is the only place capable of besting C.G. in Vegas.  Absolutely superb execution.  (And no 6x wine mark-ups, it's reasonable.)"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas.  It's located in the Fashion Show Mall adjacent to the Wynn.  I've been told about this place several times but just never made it.  Now I regret not going earlier.   The ambiance, service, food and drinks are superior to most restaurants.    We had steak, soup, salad and followed up by creme brûlée.  If you haven't ever been here then your missing out.   Sorry I didn't mention the servers name.  We were 2 bottles of wine deep and forgot.  I'll be back though."}
{"text":"I would go here again and again. The price is about on par with a steak house so don't go here if you are looking for a cheap meal. Having said that you definitely get what you pay for. I had the 10oz fillet mignon with the pepper corn sauce on the side. There is a $28 bottomless wine which I also partook in. Ending the meal; cheese cake with berries (oink!). To top it all off out waitress was a lot of fun during the whole meal. Great, food and service. I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I dined here on our Anniversary weekend. What a great choice. The experience was wonderful. Great staff that was extremely courteous and made you feel special. We made a reservation and upon arriving we were taken straight to our table. It was decorated with confetti hearts and a card wishing us a happy anniversary. Our waiter Joe was one of the best we've ever had anywhere. He was extremely helpful in helping us select our orders. We took our time going through the courses and they never made us feel rushed. Our sides were out of this world and the special, tomahawk ribeye was awesome. Th surprise complimentary dessert tray at the end of the meal was a great way to top of the whole meal. We had one of the most memorable anniversary meals ever and will definitely be dining here again."}
{"text":"Great chain - inconsistent menu across USA.. nice service however.  I usually have various beef and seafood along with a few starters. I have been to them in 9 different cities now ( USA) with clients ... Some are more flexible than others"}
{"text":"If I could give this event 6 stars, I would!  Already walking in I was impressed by the ice carving of Yelp and employees offering drinks as we walked in the door!    Here are my favorite bites out of the bunch:  Coconut Cream Pie Mini Tenderloin sandwich Calamari  The coconut cream pie was so scrumptious that my friend ate three. I personally ate 2-3 mini tenderloin sandwiches as well as lobster rolls.   I always love bringing new friends to these Yelp events. Its really exciting showing a friend how awesome Yelp is as we chow down on these delicious treats! The employees were ultra nice and very kind. Superb customer service! at the end of the day I feel so lucky to be invited to these events, it is always a day cheer-me-up-er! Great cameo from Gabi. & Thanks Nader for always taking awesome pictures! Another job well done, Lindsey!"}
{"text":"Excellent service!!! We decided to try this spot for my birthday and they did an amazing job. The food was awesome, the drinks were good and very strong I might add. The server was Dwayne and he was the bomb!!!! I definitely recommend this spot if you are looking for good food and excellent service."}
{"text":"Love love love!! First off, the lobster bisque was amazing. The fresh and large chunks of lobster were mouth watering. I then had the filet sandwich with truffle fries. The filet had a Capitol Grill special sauce that was a mix between a goat cheese spread and aioli. The truffle fries were hands down the best I have ever had. Nothing even compares. The filets were perfectly cooked, as were the fries. The artichoke bisque was also fantastic. We were able to sit outside in the financial district of Charlotte, which is beautiful. Definitely a must go to if you are in the area."}
{"text":"High end steak place with nice ambiance. Not a quiet place but still able to chat across the table. Went during restaurant week and the price was right.  Service was great Good was very good but I got to say Ruth's Chris steaks are better tasting."}
{"text":"Very good - consistent with most Capital Grille restaurants.  Inside the restaurant we had a near 5-star experience.  Right outside the restaurant however were some very shady characters.  We would not let the ladies we were with walk unescorted to their cars."}
{"text":"I visit this place every time I come down to Vegas.  Great food, staff, and atmosphere.  I prefer to request seating by the windows facing the strip.  They always take care of me and when I have visited in a special occasion they have always gone the extra mile in having a note on the table and also comping the dessert of choice.  I will definitely continue to make this a stop each time I return!!!! I am dessert person and my favorite here is the Creme Brulee... Yums!!!"}
{"text":"The good - my wife liked her salmon entree, service was excellent.  The not so good - burger ordered medium came out more than well done and it was the size of a burger on the McDonald's value burger menu.  The Micky D's at least had some flavor.  Might be the poorest $8 burger ever except it was $18. My wife's dinner was a 4, mine was a zero, hence a 2 overall. At least we saw a good basketball game on TV."}
{"text":"Excellent service! I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner here this evening. Our waiter was awesome and accomodating. Unfortunately I forgot his first name, last name is Harris.  I was there on a first date, therefore I didn't go for it and pig out. LOL! I did order a Cosmo, which was so good, I was humming after the first sip! I also had lobster/crab cakes which were full of seafood and very good.   My only unfavorable critique is that my wedge salad was over-dressed to the point where I couldn't eat it. However the wonderful waiter adjusted the check.  My dated and I shared asparagus which were seasoned and prepared perfectly. The other star of the show for me were the mashed potatoes; which were the best I've ever tasted. The Cosmo had me all worked up, so I didn't have a chance to identify what's in them.  My date enjoyed his salmon, which he said was moist and flavorful.  The host staff were super friendly. Very nice restaurant. Can't wait to go back and try a steak."}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week, ordered the tenderloin and my wife had the filet. Both dishes were incredible. Our waiter was very helpful and helped us choose the best option for food and drinks  The regular menu looked amazing but expensive. Would def come back on a special date night"}
{"text":"Busy place, but totally worth getting a reservation. Full of beautiful people, great service and awesome food choices."}
{"text":"Wife and I always make it a point to have dinner here when in Vegas. Previous visit was 3 years back and incredible, so hopes were high for a similar experience. I have to say that we were not disappointed.  Table was ready when we arrived and service was spot on. Crab and lobster cakes appetizer was terrific and flavorful with big lobster pieces (wife thought they were tomatoes!). Both ordered the filet, which were cooked as ordered to perfection.  No dessert or coffee for us as we we started to slip into a food coma after eating those protein bombs.  Eaten at a lot of places in Vegas and this is still a favorite!"}
{"text":"Loved sitting outside on a Spring night. We had 8 people at the table and decided to get multiple apps, salads and entrees and split them. It was excellent. Loved it all, salads were great as well as the steak. Definitely would go back.  Service was soild."}
{"text":"I love the steak but..... The salad can use a little help. But it don't matter because even the service is wonderful. There is a few things in the menu that I really like. This place a absolutely a great pick for a dinner date or just a visit to the bar for a glass of wine,.... Or two.... Three? Okay a bottle then.  Perfect for anniversary! There is a lot of fine dining places in the strip but why bother go from the valet to the the other side of the casino to eat in the restaurant, if your a chick and wearing stilettos your feet is done, kaput !  But here there is valet too, a few steps to the elevator up the capital grill and there it is! Excellent food that you can't go wrong with! This is for sure a GO place and a GO back here again!"}
{"text":"I've probably been to this Capital Grille well over a 100 times.  I just don't check-in each time.  People often ask \"where is the best steak in Vegas\" and the answer is simple. Capital Grille has one of the best this side of the Mississippi!   We've tried just about everything on the menu and my favorite remains the Kona Crusted New York.  They offer it as a bone-in but can also do it without the bone.  We do work lunches here 2-3x a month. They have great entree salads as well as amazing burgers!  Like crazy good burgers! If you are nice, sometimes they will make a burger for you for dinner if that's your thing.  They offer really good soups and salads.  The French Onion is insane and a meal in itself.  We often order the wedge salad and they split it for us before it comes to the table. It's great.  The apps are amazeballs too!  My personal fav is the lobster crab cakes. No filler in these babies.  There's a great selection of sides up to and including baked potatoes (not on the menu) and lobster mac and cheese. If you have any room left or need a bite of something sweet...get the sampler platter and take it home for later. It's a WOW dessert!  The restaurant is located to the front of the Fashion Show mall across from the Wynn. Parking at the mall is free (if you don't valet) so this is a huge plus considering all the local hotels now charge for parking (yuck)!  The staff is friendly and they don't have much turnover. We've had the same waiters/waitress for some time.  I remember going in after my Mom had passed.  The waitress actually cried when she'd heard Mom was gone. How sweet is that?  Cap Grille is doing it right! They are consistent which is a rarity these days.  Steaks are cooked exactly as you ask. They take our reservations and try to always give us a table with a view.  We have the \"family\" table.    Holy crap! I almost forgot the very best thing here!!! If you drink, get yourself and everyone else at your table a \"stoli-doli\"! It's a pineapple infused vodka drink shaken at the table and served in a chilled martini glass.  Careful as these babies go down like water.    See you this week Cap Grill! We have a lunch and a dinner this week alone :-)"}
{"text":"Sure, it's a chain steak house. But that doesnt stop it from being being one of the best steakhouses you can find in certain cities. This location is excellent.  We had the calamari to start off, which comes served with hot peppers that give it an usual, but welcome kick. I then had a cup of the lobster bisque, which was excellent and included very generous chunks of lobster meat. They bring you a hot cup of the bisque, and then pour some sherry into it for you after they put it on the table. Many bisques include sherry but I liked how adding it after it is already on the table adds to the presentation.   I had a dry aged, kona crusted, filet for an entree (Bone-in). The steak was prepared medium, as I requested. This was a great steak, the rub gave it a nice flavor, and they brought out a nice shallot butter sauce with it. We ordered the South African lobster tail as a side. This is the best lobster I've had yet, it has a distinct sweetness to it that I hadn't previously experienced. If you get a chance to eat south african lobster, don't pass it up!  Service was pretty good, very knowledgeable and attentive. Nice atmosphere.  5/5 all around"}
{"text":"I read all the great reviews and  was excited to go but so disappointed. The Delmonico steak was blah. I had one with the rub and my husband had the plain but they were both just ok nothing exciting. The Parmesan truffle fries and lobster mac n cheese we good. Service was great and the atmosphere is like every other nice restaurant here in town. Again it wasn't bad but at $50 a steak I would hope to say wow that was really awesome. Maybe the majority of people eat a lot of bland food so this is exciting to them but if you are like me and looking for more flavor than your average steak go somewhere else"}
{"text":"The Capital Grill Phoenix was outstanding!  Stephanie and her staff of CoCo provided a wonderful dining experience.  We had the Bone-In Ribeye which was cooked to perfection.  Great side dishes of Brussels Sprouts,  Lobster Mac 'n Cheese and Augratin Potatoes.  A fun evening out.  Bring your wallet as the prices are hefty."}
{"text":"Today's luncheon menu...

{"text":"My husband took me here for New Year's (& I realized this was in my Draft reviews so I'm just getting around to posting it ).  Our server, Ron, was very friendly & attentive.  Each course was delicious.  I'd definitely recommend this for a special occasion restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here for a business lunch, so my views are probably skewed since I didn't pay. If I was paying this might have been a 2 star.   Service/atmosphere/views were awesome. Got to watch the Frontier sign come down during lunch.. sweet!   Mint Lemonade: yummy Bread basket: Warm and delish but nothing special. Calamari: Honestly not that exciting. Just pretty good.  Crab/lobster cake: kinda disappointing. It had a slightly fishy taste and was rather \"mushy\".  Lobster salad: I asked the waiter how mayonaisy (yup I made that word up just now) it was.. and he claimed it had very little. The thing came out and was very goopey and kinda gross. I felt sick all day after eating it.  Cappucino: FAB.. gotta love the rock candy stir stick.   Bumping up a star despite my gross entree because the experience was really nice. Plus my fellow diner's prime rib sandwich looked awesome.. plus their burgers are supposedly the best (per Consumer Reports). It's a decent place to eat in Vegas.. but with so many better options nearby (namely Babareeba, StripBurger, Isla, hell anything at the Wynn if you have that kind of cash.. etc), it's hard to get that excited about coming here."}
{"text":"Let's face it: This is a paleo-conservative restaurant, right down to the prominent portrait of Barry Goldwater looking out over the dining room.  This is a place to take the other members of the board to discuss serious matters pertaining to corporate governance. There is nothing silly or frivolous in it. The lights are just bright enough to underline the respectability of it all.   In short, the decor has got the sort of overstuffed-leather-chair solidity that compliments the stern quality of the offerings. The lunch specials are a good value at about $16 bucks for a variety of high-quality plates. Service is something close to splendid.   This place makes you want to become a member of the military-industrial complex."}
{"text":"Not you're average chain restaurant - but hopefully that's not stating the obvious for this that are familiar with Capital Grille. I usually don't order salmon at restaurants, or a steakhouse for that matter. However, I was completely impressed with the taste and how it was prepared. Also I had their spin on the Old Fashioned - the \"In Fashion\". Okay, I had 3 just to check quality control. It was a tasty drink.   I'll go back and hit the replay button on this night's meal."}
{"text":"The entire experience was memorable as this meal was the celebration for my friends 70th Birthday.  I used open table to make our reservation and let them know that we were celebrating a retired Air Force F-4 navigators 70th Birthday.  The only request I made was for a good table and WOW was my request accommodated.  We were given the best table in the house.  The 5 of us ordered 4 different meals which we let each other taste test.  The steaks were each cooked to perfection.  Our shrimp appetizer was equally amazing.  The bread was delicious  as were our sides.  The final touch was when our Birthday man was treated to a sweet desert with a plate adorned with the words Happy Birthday.   Sure it's a bit expensive but you only turn 70 once so why not celebrate in style.  It was well worth the price and the staff was amazing.  Make sure you try the pineapple infused signature cocktail."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at the capital grill tonight for the very first time it was outstanding. I started out with a capital cosmopolitan and he had the adult only Arnold Palmer,  then I had the lobster crab cakes it was to die for. For dinner I had the  porcini Rubbed Bone-In Ribeye with the grilled asparagus and the lobster mac and cheese OMG is all I can say, the steak was so tender and juicy, he had the Wagyu Cheeseburger with Fried Egg and Crisp Onions and truffle Parmesan fries. The serves was absolutely  wonderful  our waiter name was David he was always there he never missed a beat this whole experience was absolutely great. We had a ball for the food was GREAT!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Kettle One Martini's with Blue Cheese Olives, Medium Rare Steak and a dark bar! Yeah, there is a pretty good chance you will find me in a place like this. I am drooling as I write this review. The Capital Grille at the Biltmore is the perfect place to take a break from shopping. Sit at the bar and have a couple cocktails and some calamari and you will be ready for some more shopping with the gf. Could be dangerous shopping if you have one too many FYI."}
{"text":"I had the lamb and it was ever so tasty- came with a great plum sauce. We also tried- Lobster mac&cheese (kind of oily but still good) Spinach (tasted a little too charred and bitter...) French onion soup (a solid good soup)  Our waitress was very nice but once we ordered our appetizers she did not return for at least 25 minutes and even then we had to tell her we planned on ordering actual entrees.. I don't know if she assumed we were only getting appetizers because we are young and maybe the clientele is typically ritzy old people (there was a couple celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary next to us). Granted I underestimated how classy this place was and came dressed in jeans and converse shoes but that is still not a reason to assume anything.   Waiting a long time to put our order in meant waiting even longer for it to be cooked and served to us we managed to order,eat, and pay the bill just under two hours..."}
{"text":"Ok... been around the block a few times with recent Steak restaurants like Jean George, Morton's, Delmonico, and Gallager's, but Capital Grille is still by far our fav surf and turf place.  To start off our dining experience, we always get the Seafood plateau.  It's a ton of seafood and totally worth the $99.  You get a heathy portion of lobster, crab meat, oysters, and shrimp cocktail.  The bone-in ribeye is my go to all the time, but they had a special bone-in filet that was to die for.   My wife and kids ordered that... wish I did too.  It was succulent, juicy, and cut like \"butter\".  If they have it again, that'll be my go to 100% each time.  The sides were amazing as always.  We had the wild mushrooms, lobster mac and cheese, creme spinach, and mash potatoes.  To finish off our dining experience, we had our go to Banana cream pie desert.   A little too much whipped cream this time, but still amazing.     If you're asking if the juice is worth the squeeze?  I'd say hellz ya my ninjas!"}
{"text":"I feel bad giving this place such a low rating when one of my good friends fiance used to work here.  We went for my birthday and it was subpar.  The cut of steak was nice, the ambiance was nice,  the server was nice, but the food did not meet my standards.  When I am paying $40 for a steak, I want a $40 steak.   I have had better for $5.99 steak in Las Vegas.   I will not be dining here again because I am not getting my money's worth.   On a side note, the bartender Tatum was a joke.  No personality, no help what so ever.  When we asked for a recommendation on a glass of wine, she said \"I don't know\"  She took a while to greet us at the bar and it was not crowded.  I guess polishing glasses is more important.  Isn't the bar where the customer get's their first impression?"}
{"text":"Wow what an amazing Elite event!  The service was fantastic!  The staff was very helpful and brought out delicious bites.  I want to say a big thanks to one staff who went out of his way to bring me and my friend a taste of the shrimp cocktail.  My favorites bites include the Truffle French Fries, Crab Slider, and Coconut Cream Pie.  I liked the different spicy spin on the Calamari dish.    Thank you Capital Grill was hosting this wonderful event!  This is a great intimate affair with fellow Elite Yelpers!  Huge thanks to Lindsey and the Yelp Team! 2012 is turning into a fantastic year of Yelp events!"}
{"text":"My husband and i spent his birthday Tuesday night with Ricky. The service and suggestions were amazing-we loved the wine and splitting the delmonico with two different preparations. Outstanding service, enthusiasm and a great experience with Ricky."}
{"text":"What an elegant place to dine at! It's hidden amongst a cluster of restaurants so finding the entrance was a challenge for me. We were seated in a booth with a beautiful view. As soon as we sat down, the waiter came and started talking through the menu with us. He was extremely nice and tentative.   We ordered the calamari for appetizer and the sea bass and salmon for entree. All of the items were really good. I want to come back and order the calamari again!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful dining experience! Service was very attentive, we wanted for nothing. Steak was insanely awesome, the Truffle Fries were pure bliss, and the champagne made for a unique albeit slightly giddy lunch :) If you want to impress someone, this is definitely a great place to do it!"}
{"text":"The best service I ever had anywhere. Nathan was our server and was absolutely the sweetest and most attentive server we have experienced, especially around here. We truly enjoyed our whole dining experience.  They acknowledge my boyfriend's boyfriend from our greeting to our beautiful dessert.  Everything was quick and perfect. water glasses stayed full which goes a long way with me who is not a big drinker.  My boyfriend ordered the gorgonzola crusted strip and I tried a bit. It was heavenly and cooked to perfection. My swordfish was great, perfect balance of flavors.  And the dessert was better than imagine. My favorite dessert is creme brulee and my boyfriend's is cheesecake so that fact that they served a brulee style cheesecake stole my heart.  Perfect dinner.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"No matter where you are, you can always depend on a capital grille to be top notch in every aspect. Came here on a trip to Charlotte, and just like every other capital grille experience, it was pretty much perfect.   I had a card for a free appetizer from a capital grille in Philly, so I was able to to use it at the Charlotte location for a free appetizer. I ordered the calamari and as always it was delicious. In addition to this they give you a plate full of freshly made potato chips that are delicious. Between both of these it made for a perfect happy hour along with their awesome rum selection.  The service at this location was extra good being that there was a hint of southern hospitality added to an already great service experience. The bartender was quick, attentive and kept the drink glass full after seeing I was getting low. Great experience and I look forward to visiting the next Cap Grille in a different city."}
{"text":"If you want good quality food, this is the place for you.  However, be prepared to spend a pretty penny.  Just to be apart of their \"locker club\", which just stores your favorite wines (that you have to pay for in addition to the locker fee), it costs $300. This is meant for snooty types that like to impress people.   Anyway, I've been able to sample some of their food, no expense to me THANK GOODNESS, and everything was delicious.  It is like they have someone singing sweet lullabies and nurturing each plate of food in the back.  If you get a chance, book their cozy back room for a private party. I believe the booking is free. Can you believe that?? Or maybe I'm wrong."}
{"text":"I waited to write this review so that I could gather myself a little bit. I didn't want my annoyance to modify my review.   We stopped in here about two weeks ago, my family had gone across town for family holiday pictures. As we were driving back home I commented to my wife how good our kids were and how sharp they looked. I had never been to Capital Grille and I figured this was a prime opportunity as at the moment we looked like the Cleavers. I called and they had plenty of openings but I put in a reservation for four in just to be safe.    We arrived and the hostesses were all very pleasant. They seated us at a table for eight essentially where the wait staff had the highest amount of traffic. I thought it was a little odd as the place was about forty percent capacity. It appeared to me that most of the tables offered a little more privacy and honestly I felt a little on display. The waiter arrived and took our drink order, I also asked for an order of the shrimp cocktail. The drinks came out promptly. The young man who brought bread and kept our water glasses full  was very courteous and attentive. The shrimp cocktail came out in about twenty minutes. Usually at a restaurant at this price point you get three or four rather large shrimp. These were four literal \"shrimp\".   This is where things started to go sideways. When the waiter brought out the shrimp cocktail I asked the waiter for another cocktail and told him we were ready to order. He said he would be right back. I am fairly certain he didn't go on break because I could see him occasionally attending to other tables. Twenty minutes after that and having had our water glasses filled three times I asked the young man to track down our waiter and let him know we would like to order. We have now been at the restaurant for about forty to forty five minutes. Our waiter got within proximity to our table where I felt I could use an appropriate volume to speak to him without yelling. I said \"excuse me sir, we would like to order\". To which he held up one finger and continued to walk away.    You know you've reached a proverbial bridge in the evening where after having been somewhere for an hour you still haven't ordered. If only I had been given that second cocktail I probably would have been a little less agitated. Alas it was not to be. I got up from my seat and found another waiter and requested my check.    The second waiter sent our waiter to my table and I am not making this up, he looked me dead in the eyes and asked me \"would you like to order.\" I think my face must've made something similar to a great white's during shark week because I am fairly certain my eyes rolled into the back of my head. I heard my wife grab our kids and head for the car. I looked him dead in the face and told him, \"yes I was about forty five minutes ago, at this point I just want to pay my check and get out of there.\" He again looked me dead in the eyes and asked me \"are you serious?\" in the most condescending voice he could muster.     I have a feeling the food here is very good to excellent but I will never know and it will always be one of the greatest culinary mysteries of my life."}
{"text":"A nice thing about going to one of the big 3 steakhouse chains is that you know exactly what you're going to get.  Is is unusual or adventurous?  Of course not, but that's not why you're going to one of these restaurants.  You're going because you want a great piece of meat with a big, powerful, this-should-really-be-decanted-for-a-while red to go with it.  The Capital Grille absolutely delivers on that account.  My wife and I recently had dinner on a weeknight.   It's dark and full of wood paneling inside.  We saw a bunch of Steelers sitting at a table together.  We started off with oysters which were excellent as expected.  We split a spinach salad with warm bacon dressing which was also tasty.  Both we paired with a nice sparkling blanc de blanc.  For entrees, I went with their signature Kona-crusted sirloin with shallot butter and my wife had the filet Oscar.  Both were cooked perfectly.  We paired those with a nice, heavy, Merlot-dominant blend.  For dessert we got the homemade ice-cream and cookies.  The 3 flavors our night were vanilla, dark chocolate, and brownie batter (yes, it was as good as it sounds).  I also had a glass of vintage Taylor Fladgate that was superb.  Throughout the evening our server was quite attentive.  Despite eating on a Monday, the large space seemed mostly full.  Everyone has their own opinion about which of the big 3 steakhouse chains is their favorite.  Personally, I'm more partial to Ruth's Chris with their sizzling steaks with extra butter.  However, the Capital Grille is overall just as good and a great choice for this kind of dinner."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!!!! They were crazy nice and service was once    in a lifetime. The food was perfect!!! My wife and I have never been treated with such respect. This is not something we can afford often but when we and my wife can again there is no doubt were we will be going."}
{"text":"We stumbled into The Capital Grille after being told there was a 45-hour long wait at Maganello's next door. We were seated immediately. Our server Julie was full of smiles and very knowledgeable concerning the menu. She was able to answer all questions we had.  Appetizers were lovely. Salads were huge...what out for the bacon included-they are large chunks. Steaks were amazing, seasoned and cooked to perfection. I got the porter house and was able to take home to finish.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I was only in Charlotte for one night and I'm glad my coworkers and I found this restaurant to eat. Ambience is great, service was fantastic and the food was top notch. I ordered a boned filet and it was cooked exactly to my taste and met all my expectations of a great steakhouse. The mashed potatoes were packed with flavor and the asparagus was cooked just right.  I highly suggest that you save some room for the cheesecake creme bulee. It is a typical cheesecake but has the top crusted like a creme bulee. This was one of the best desserts I've had."}
{"text":"Service and food was amazing.  Went for a birthday dinner... Capital Grille made it extra special.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Thursday evening for a pharmaceutical hosted event. For appetizers we had the Wagyu beef carpaccio. For salads, we had a Ceasar and Wedge salad with bacon. For the main course, we had a 10oz fillet mignon and 14oz sirlion steak. For dessert, we finished off with creme brulee and a flourless chocolate espresso cake.    - I had to park next to the green at the Fashion Show mall to get here. Went up an escalator and out the food court and into Capital Grille.  - Great service. Servers greeted me with a glass of white wine and took my order promptly.  - Wagyu beef was finely sliced. Reminds me of when I go to a korean BBQ or Japanese restaurant. Nice presentation and nice flavor. - The wedge salad was interesting. Litterally a chopped head. Don't think you're expected to finish all of it, but if you managed to do so, good for you. haha.  - The steak and fillet mignon were excellent! Very juicy and tender. High recommendation. But if I had to chose, I go with the sirloin over the fillet.  - We had mashed potatoes, mushrooms and green beans for side. Taste like any other steak restaurant to me, equivalent Mastro's.  -  The desserts were sweet. Excellent presentation. Just what I expected."}
{"text":"Impeccable service but mediocre food. We have been here a handful of times in the past for lunch, but we were disappointed last time and this time again. We like the comfy booth seating and large windows facing the Strip. The service is friendly, accommodating, and attentive. Unfortunately the food does not match up.   Appetizer: the only good dish we had today was the fried calamari with peppers though it was a bit oily.   Soup: French onion soup looked appetizing, but the soup and onions were way too salty.   Lunch entrees: Salmon and mango salad with champagne vinegrette had potential, but the salmon was dry on the sides and lacked flavor. The mangos were hard and sour. Previous Yelper had voiced disappointment with this dish too.   Chilean Seabass was so-so and a tad dry, but the mushrooms were unbearably salty in the soy sauce. Palazzo's SushiSamba has way better moist Chilean sea bass.   Lobster and crab cake burger is supposed to be a top seller, but the crab cake had too much flour. The lobster also was dry. The housemade salt and vinegar chips were good.   Side: lobster mac n' cheese was a disappointment as the lobsters did not taste fresh. The lobster was very dry and far from succulent. I often order this dish at various restaurant, and this was one of the worse ones since the lobster was bad. The mac n'cheese were good though. If you like lobster, go to Top of the World at the Stratosphere for fresh succulent Canadian lobster.   Dessert: they were very kind and offered us a dessert duo of chocolate cake and cheesecake. We were hoping the dessert would be better, but unfortunately, the best part about dessert were the fresh berries that came with it. There is a fresh berries dessert on the menu too. I would recommend that.   Overall, the service is great, but the food was disappointing. With so many delicious culinary delights to choose from in Vegas, Capital Grille does not stand the heat. It needs to improve it's quality and taste of food. I have never been for dinner, but lunch was a regrettable experience."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time on Saturday night. We had an 8:45 reservation and were seated upon arrival. The decor is elegant and I was excited.  My excitement was short lived as it took 40 minutes, not an exaggeration, to get our drinks. We were also seated in area where the wait staff continuously placed dirty dishes. I was beginning to think this was a big mistake, but when our food arrived, i knew my disappointment was going to change. I ordered the roasted chicken and au gratin potatoes and my meal was excellent. The chicken was tender, juicy, and had just the right amount of seasoning. The au gratin potatoes were creamy. My boyfriend had the aged del monico, sam's mashed potatoes, and scallops. His steak was tender and seasoned to perfection. We finished dinner with cheesecake and coconut creme pie. Needless to say, the food here is excellent. I only gave four stars because I would expect better service from a high end restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a friday afternoon especially since friends have raved about the truffle fries here and no way can I turn that down.  First thing that caught my attention was the outstanding service that we received.  My server changed out my white napkin for a black one cuz I was wearing black pants and she didn't want lint to get all over me.  I have been to all kinds of establishments and this was the first time I have had this happen to me...5 stars for that alone.  So 2 of us shared a burger and a basket of truffled fries and a mediterranean salad with chicken.  The server had the kitchen split everything for us which was great.  The burger came out on plates that had holes for their sauce container and let me tell you that was one good burger.  This place sure knows how to handle their beef.  And the truffle fries were good but the only back part is I like skinny fries but it was greatr otherwise.  I can't say the same for the chicken in my salad though.  The salad was great but the chicken was dry as h***....which was why I had to take out one star.  I should know by now never order chicken or seafood at a steakhouse.    Definitely will come back again on future visit...the french onion soup looked really good!"}
{"text":"Restaurant Week Meal #1 (Lunch for $30.13):  Clam Chowder  OR Field Greens, Dry-Aged Sirloin Salad OR Grille's Signature Cheeseburger OR Caesar Salad with Chicken Breast OR Seared Citrus Glazed Salmon, Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake OR Creme Brulee OR Handcrafted Ice Cream OR Seasonal Fruit Sorbet  Clam Chowder: Generous amount of clams. Good chowder. 4/5  Dry-Aged Sirloin Salad: I was expecting a few slices of steak on a bed of greens but I got a big piece of steak (about 10oz) with a side of greens.  The menu description said it comes with arugula but mine was spinach. It has roasted peppers and mozzarella with olive oil and balsamic dressing. 3.5/5  Grille's Signature Cheeseburger with Truffle Fries: I've been coming to Capital Grille for years now that somehow it doesn't seem so special anymore.  I always get either a steak or a burger with truffle fries.  Shawn asked me why I never told him about CG's burger and truffle fries...oops, sorry! But yes, the beef patty is totally delicious and quite big and the fries...ooohhh...5/5  Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake: A dense chocolate cake. The espresso emphasizes the chocolate flavor. Try not to inhale if you have a piece of this cake in your mouth, the cocoa powder on top will choke you. 4/5  Creme Brulee: Rich and creamy made with real vanilla beans. The caramelized top isn't one whole piece...more like drops of caramelized sugar but that didn't affect the texture or the taste. 4/5  I like this place and I've never had a bad experience.  They're consistently good (food and service). You can get a view of the Wynn and Encore.  To get here, take the elevator/escalators to the 3rd floor and go outside the Food Court and turn left.  They have private rooms for meetings or group functions. I normally don't have to pay for my meals when I go here."}
{"text":"Another restaurant week, another visit to Capital Grille.  You really can't beat the price for the great food you get!  Caesar salad, Filet w/Green beans and mashed potatoes, and cheesecake with strawberries.  Always scrumptious, always cooked to perfection.   If you are interested in trying Capital Grille - Restaurant week is always a great time to go - great price for great food!"}
{"text":"Severely disappointed after my friend had a drink spilled on him by our server. The manager came out  and apologized then cracked a few jokes. We were all very understanding, thinking they would make it right with a free side dish or something. Dry cleaning at the very least, but nothing. My friend had to sit there uncomfortably, in a soaked shirt. Wish I could give 5 stars as the food was great."}
{"text":"Our group of 8 recently enjoyed dinner at the CG in Pittsburgh. It was a very busy night as the Steelers were in town and the restaurant was seating two very large groups of Cardinals fans. As we have come to expect from the CG, the food was excellent. But we found the  service to be below our past experiences. When our server delivered an overcooked steak to my wife,  a restaurant manager noticed our frustration and stepped in to relieve us of the need to lodge a complaint with our server. So that the my wife would not sit with nothing to eat while they fired another steak, the manager sent her a wonderful crabmeat cocktail. The manager later returned with a perfectly cooked steak. I learned the managers name is Nick and that not only is he excellent with patrons, he is highly regarded by his fellow employees. Bravo Nick!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation on a Wednesday to enjoy a splurge date with my wife. We wanted to enjoy the Queens Feast, a 3 course structured meal. I walked in by myself, the wife was still parking after waiting 10 minutes out front for a valet attendant. To her disappointment, the valet service is after 6pm, but you do not know that until you walk up to the valet podium to see the sign. I politely waited about 10 minutes for a hostess to seat me & the wife arrived a few minutes later after parking in a garage that didn't feel safe to her. Sherry was our waiter & was very pleasant as well as informative. The food was good but not unusually spectacular & it did arrive in a reasonable time. The bill appeared high for the structured Queens Feast, but we attributed it to the second glass of wine she had. With the lighting so dim & the receipt print faded we paid the bill with the intent of checking it at home. After walking my wife to her car in the shady parking garage near by she drove me to my car parked in the street. Once home we reviewed the receipt  to discover a 3rd $35 Queens Feast was charged in error. I called & was transferred to a manager I assume that apologized & assured me it would be credited. I'm not sure who's error it was, but Sherry now gets tipped on the overcharged bill & walks away with a bonus percentage on an already fair 20% while we are merely given an I'm so sorry... we will gladly return to Del Frisco's & Ruth Chris for our future uptown steakhouse experiences."}
{"text":"I only sat at the bar, and I only got drinks and oysters. But I'm a girl in town for a convention casually exploring the bar scene. And this was my favorite experience, hands down. I've done everything on this trip from Senor Frogs to the 23rd floor at Mandarin Oriental. Nowhere did I feel as comfortable or satisfied as I did at Capital Grille. Juan behind the bar was a big part of that. The giant oysters and tasty Stoli Dolis were another. I'm thankful for the find, and I'll be back soon.   And for what it's worth, this has generally been my experience at most Capital Grilles in almost every city they exist."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to The Capital Grille in Atlanta, New York and Washington DC and this one is the WORST of them all!  Don't get me wrong, their food were still great especially their steaks - very juicy and flavorful; keep the two stars just for their steaks. That's why I'm still keeping the 3 stars for their steaks and side dishes.   Here were what we've experienced that disappointed us:  1 - Front desk hostesses: unfriendly, didn't greet us when we arrived or even say a word; we stood  and waited for 1min and walked closer to them to say \"hi\", then they asked \"reservation?\" without a smile. We said \"Yes, reservation at 7pm\" then they looked at the book and said \"just a moment\" and we stood and waited aside for a good 8min before they led us to a table.  2 - Our female server walked back and forth busy serving other tables and we were seated at the table for 12min, Seriously? You can't just come by to take drink orders or even just ask us to give a few more minutes?  3 - She was very impatience; we wanted to ask for the best bottle of wine for our food, she didn't get us the correct wine menu so she had to go get it a couple of times and gave us a weird unhappy look then she returned and said \"you might need a moment to look, I'll be back\" then walked away. Hence, we waited for another 10min before we ordered our drink.  4 - Food-wise, everything was perfect until dessert; we ordered their creme brule and that's what we always order; however, when it came, the entire creme brule was freezing cold and firm! Usually the bottom egg part is soft and cold with warm top sugar crust that is freshly made to order. It looked and tasted like something they put in the fridge overnight (perhaps someone didn't want it). So we told our server, she didn't even look/check the creme brule and immediately said \"it IS how we do it, you can talk to our manager if you want\"  Oh my lord! Really?! That pissed my husband off so badly! So of course we wanted to speak to their manager; the manager came and first he said the same thing that it was how they do it without checking it, we asked him to look closer and he started to realize the weird firmness of the brule. He started to apologize and to bring a freshly made one out to us, and removing the brule from the check.  As much as we love The Capital Grille in other cities, we will definitely pass this one and not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Just Delicious!  We used to go to CG in downtown Chicago for biz lunches, and it's just as good here in Pittsburgh.  I don't eat beef so today I had the sushi-grade tuna for lunch today, and it was amazing, an enormous piece perfectly seared on the outside and rare on the inside. The flour-less chocolate cake was to die for. They even made a plain chicken breast for my toddler, and it was better than any plain chicken  breast I've ever tasted.  The service was impeccable as expected.  There are better steakhouses in the world, but this one will likely not disappoint for an good fine dining experience in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I ran in here for lunch on Friday. Here's a few quick thoughts:  Exceptional service (really, really incredible service). Remarkably memorable Wagyu Carpaccio, Way too thick Lobster Bisque that they took off the menu, and a good ribeye steak sandwich (a bit too fatty). Even though the food wasn't perfect (well, the carpaccio was more than perfect), I'm still giving Cap Grille 4 stars because I know that this experience, although imperfect is going to get me back and trying more of their menu."}
{"text":"I have repeatedly dined at Capital Grille for their tender steaks, which are always served perfectly to the specified temperature, as well as their wonderful seafood. They are one of only five restaurants in Phoenix that ages their steak for 21 days, and they have one butcher who is solely dedicated to rotating them on dated racks from fresh to aged. Their Caprese Salad is fantastic, which is no surprise since the mozzarella cheese is made fresh in-house daily and the Caprese layers of golden tomatoes, red ripe tomato slice, basil leaf, two slices of homemade cheese, and olive oil are topped with a 15 year old aged balsamic. My usual choice of entree is their filet mignon since it cuts like butter and is just the right size for me. One of my favorite side dishes is the creamy Au Gratin Potatoes with a crunchy topping that gives it texture and a delicious flavor.  Another side dish that I enjoy is the grilled asparagus drizzled with lemon and sprinkled with a rare sea salt called Fleur de sel. (You may read about this further on my website: www.LaurieVermillion.com.)  As you can see in my photos, the atmosphere is upscale with rich wood and beautiful lighting. The wine kiosk holds 2,000 bottles of wine, and there are wine lockers with name plates, at the entrance, for regulars to store their wine or special glasses. The desserts are a must. They have an in-house baker who makes them daily and garnishes them to order with the freshest, most flawless berries. The flourless chocolate espresso cake is rich, dusted with cocoa powder and garnished with raspberry sauce and fresh raspberries.  My favorites are their spectacular Creme Brulee topped with fresh berries and their special signature cheesecake molded in a cylindrical shape.  We always ask for Eric Lewis, who is the best there. He has so many years of experience and, thusly, trains the other servers.  He is a relaxed professional, who is personable, friendly, and makes you feel as if you are his top priority, while efficiently doing so for all of his other guests.   The last time that we dined there, we simply mentioned that our son had finished his first year of college with a 4.0, and Eric brought out a large plate that said, \"Congratulations\" with their Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake and special Cheesecake.  As for parking, there are usually available spaces, however they do have Valet parking, as well.

{"text":"The food and service was excellent.  Had the signature Grille burger and it was cooked to perfection. Everyone at the table had a great meal.  Felt a bit under dressed for lunch with jeans and a polo but they accommodated us. Food came out at the right time. Total time was about an hour for lunch.   Oh the truffle fries. They were awesome."}
{"text":"Let's start with the pros: The host staff was great! Super accommodating to our party size changing, and our noisy baby. Without asking, one of the server assistants brought me out several extra napkins to help with my messy baby.  The cons: Our server (Ruben) however was clearly having an off day. The reasons I say this is clearly The Capital Grille has high service standards, and when it came to that aspect of our dining experience, we really felt it lacking. Considering our tab was over $500 and his gratuity was three-digits, he didn't seem very happy to be there. His demeanor was cold and at times bordering on rude. I will say however, he technically met our needs, asked us for what we needed/wanted, it was just an issue with his demeanor. Lastly, the food left a bit to be desired. Some of the dishes looked and tasted great, however one of our party had an over-cooked NY Strip, and plating was subpar. Dishes costing this much (regardless of being a part of a brunch deal), should have exquisite presentation.  Overall, we will be back because past experiences have been great, and food was great those times. The reason we did not say anything at the restaurant was because we were guests. I feel ashamed that our party host spent the amount that they did, considering this experience alone."}
{"text":"The Capital Grill, Washington DC. I have been waiting almost two weeks to write a review in regards to my experience in this restaurant. I made a reservation online because it is a busy place to dine in. I thought that arriving on time was going to be at issue because I decided to go 5 days prior to the inauguration. But no, I arrived on time and was directed to a not-so-loud room as requested in my reservation. Service can be described in one word: impecable. Food: I would like to find a place which main entrees would not be beef. But, this is US and the most fanciful traditional American cuisine dish is a steak. I should not complaint because my meal was exquisite. Perfect term, moist but broiled, medium rare, pleasant cut. The salad is one of the best salads I have every eaten. It reminded me the one I ate with Janica while being in NY my last trip. My mother in law ordered the fish. The buttery cream that accompanies the fish had a soft flavor, rich and tasty. The spinach had a combination of flavors that had a not so good acceptance by my palate. The creme brûlée was, OMG!, a difficult choice to make but a satisfactory one."}
{"text":"Last night my boy friend and I dined at Capital Grille for his birthday. We were incredible impressed by the food and even more so the service! We are both young and we usually get shoved in a corner and nearly forgotten at nice restaurants, but not here!  Our server was Ken and he was wonderful! He was funny and professional and provided just the right amount of assistance. The manager stopped by on several occasions to check in, and everyone was handing out birthday well wishes.   I had the citrus seared salmon and my boyfriend had the Kona crusted bone in sirloin. We shared a Caesar salad and the au gratin potatoes. Everything was cooked just right and delicious. By far the best Salmon I've ever had!   We tried the signature pineapple martini, which really packs a punch! And we were given cheese cake and flourless espresso chocolate cake for the birthday boy. Both desserts were amazing. I would definitely order the cheese cake again!   It is an expensive restaurant, but I really felt like the expense was worth it! Great service and great food can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Steak! Steak! Steak!  This is the place that I brought my fiance to propose to her.  Everything was set up perfectly.  The entire staff was in on it.  They set me up a special table in the corner, and even served us a free bottle of celebratory champagne.  The food here was delicious, the wait staff attentive, and the wine always filled.  They also served me one of the best porterhouse steaks I've had in my entire life!  It is a bit pricey but well worth it!"}
{"text":"If you're looking to go all when taking someone out look no further! We've been here before and our experiences have always been top notch including this one. Our waiter, Daryl was pleasant and attentive and made sure everything was to our liking. Food was excellent as usual and even though we were full we couldn't pass on their creme brûlée cheesecake. We are definitely looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Although I've had many visits to sin city, I've never gotten around to actually eating a GOOD meal. McDonalds, buffets, even top ramen for that one time I should have left while I was up.   We decided to give the Capital Grille a shot since we'd been referred. If you paid me, I honestly wouldn't be able to tell you how to get to the place, BUT! I'd definitely be able to tell you that the luscious hunk of meat that was served on my plate was one of the best steaks I've had in a minute. So tender there's absolutely no need for your steak knife to mutilate the poor animal more than it has been already. Rather, make love to it with your fork and mouth. MmmMmm  The ambiance and décor are pretty dope. Its got that old school attic kinda feel with wine EVERYWHERE. The view of the strip is pretty nice, definite brownie points if you're trying to woo your old lady. And the service isn't all too bad either. Its not the 5.99 prime rib dinner at gold strike, so don't come in here if you've had a bad night at the craps tables."}
{"text":"We recently heard about the $25 burger and glass of wine and thought we would try it since we were shopping at the fashion show. Correction my wife was shopping!! Went to the capital grill sat at a quiet table near the window. We both ordered the burger with carmelized onions and a glass of Caymus. The burger was cooked to perfection and DELICIOUS!. We stayed and had a second glass of wine.  later tonight, wife tells me she needs to return something at the mall and if I go with her we can go back for another burger and glass of wine. Really suspect about the return (-:"}
{"text":"I would give this place 2 1/2 stars but that wasn't an option so it got 3 instead.  The only reason it got 3 stars was because the desert, proscuitto wrapped mozarella & lobster mac & cheese were very good.  One thing to note is that the proscuitto wrapped mozarealla is served hot.  I thought it was going to be cold and one of the reasons I ordered it is that I thought it would be a little lighter.  As it turned out, it was very heavy.  Tasted good, though.  It just wasn't what I expected.  Speaking of something that wasn't what I expected, if I had to rate this place based on the steaks alone, I would have given it a one.  Frankly, I've gotten a better steak from Whole Foods.  Also, the steak came with a pool of steak sauce on the side.  If I'm paying 47 bucks for a steak, I don't want any sauce near it.  My wife's filet actually had some sauce on top of it.  Personally, I would have asked for one without sauce.  The menu doesn't mention anything about sauce, they should really let you know about it in advance."}
{"text":"Our favorite steakhouse in the city.  Excellent food, service, and atmosphere every time we come here.  Must have:  Kona crust (on any cut of steak) and the lobster & crab cakes."}
{"text":"Our daughter made a reservation at The Capital Grille N Scottsdale to celebrate our 25th Anniversary and it also happened to be Restaurant Week. When we arrived and were seated we were pleasantly surprised with a decorated table with confetti hearts and rose petals and a good wishes card. The server Gina was so friendly and gave us great service, we decided to order from the set menu for the restaurant week and the food was excellent, the french onion soup was hot and delicious, the filet mignon was cooked as I ordered and very tendered as the cream of spinach and mashed potatos had good flavor. The drinks were also well made. All in all they gave us a great anniversary experience and we will return for another one."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner and service!  Filet was cooked perfectly.  If you are celebrating a special night and a meat eater - Go there you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised..  It's no secret that the Phoenix area is rife with a plethora of wonderful dining options.  Steakhouses are no exception, although the few we've tried in the past few months have been, well, underwhelming (Roaring Fork, Fleming's to name a few).  If I'm going to pay 5-star prices, I expect a 5-star experience.  Capital Grille is the first upscale steakhouse I've visited around Scottsdale that justified the bill at the end.  The ambiance is fancy, yet feels warm and inviting.  There are many leather-bound books, and it smells of rich mahogany.  All jokes aside, it feels like a 'jacket required' dress-code country club, but actually has the service and food to match.  Of course, being our first visit, we only got to sample a few things from the menu, but here's the breakdown:  -Wedge with Bleu Cheese and Smoked Bacon - A simple, yet amazing salad.  We ordered it chopped, because we didn't feel like doing the extra work.  Plentiful green and red cherry tomatoes, creamy bleu cheese, and cubes of awesome smoked bacon.  We polished the entire plate.  -Caramelized French Onion Soup - My wife's a FOS junkie, so she's hard to impress.  That being said, she loved their take on it.  The dinner menu doesn't mention that you can just order a cup instead of a crock, and this is a much better option for 1-2 people.  Hearty beef jus, caramelized onions, croutons, and a huge baked blob of cheese on top.  Perfection.  -Bone-in Kona Crusted Dry Aged NY Strip with Shallot Butter - Holy crap I can't even say the name in one breath.  It was worth it though, what a steak!  The coffee-based rub added just a tinge of bitter flavor around a melt-in-your-mouth meat masterpiece.  I swear this was just a filet mignon on steroids.  Highly recommended.  -Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake - If you're any sort of chocolate fan, give this a try.  A rich, fudgy morsel that just covers every taste bud in smooth chocolate flavor.  It's small, but don't let that fool you.  This thing has chocolate for days.  -Classic Creme Brulee - Ok, I was blown away by the Creme Brulee.  I've always judged creme brulees by what you can get at Steakhouse 55 at the Disneyland Hotel, and none have really come close.. until now.  Under that nice, toasted sugar layer is the creamiest, sweetest vanilla bean creme you've ever tasted.  I ate the entire little dish, I couldn't help myself.  A must have!  So that's the lowdown on our food experience.  The only thing that could make it better was top-notch service, and Joe made it happen.  Frequently checking our table, knowing everything about the menu and cocktails, and just making us feel welcome were the cornerstones of an exemplary experience.    Even though you could say there's a glut of steakhouses around Scottsdale, Capital Grille is the first one that had us both agreeing that we wanted to come back.  Cheers to fine dining!"}
{"text":"Very expensive, but amazing food! Very busy in the bar area while waiting for our table, not a lot of places to stand, feels like you're in the way of servers if all the seats are taken. I'd definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"The only reason why Brad T. & I decided to go here because we have received a coupon/deal for $50 off % 2 complimentary desserts.  We called ahead for a reservation on a Monday or Tuesday night & it was a busy night due to a convention that was in town.   FOOD (4.2 out of 5) Appetizers: Calamari: Good, I wouldnt bother ordering it again,  Entree: Mine: I ordered the seared tenderloin with butter poached lobster tail.  I always get my steaks medium rare and this tenderloin was absolutely perfect.  The taste was very juicy and succulent.  The lobster tail did not have much flavor to it, but it still tasted good but not as amazing as the tenderloin.  I savored the taste of the tenderloin ohhh how lovely it tasted.   His: Filet mignon w. crab meat: I took a bite of his filet mignon and from I remembered it was a bit overcooked but thats (Brad T.'s story to tell), I loved the taste of the crab meat though! MMMMmmm  Desserts: (Since it was complimentary)  I was astonished how huge the desserts were!   Coconut Creme Pie:  I personally did not like it very much,  I felt like it was too creamy for me.  I had a few bites here and there and the taste is good but I couldnt handle eating more of it.  Chocolate hazelnut cake: Loving chocolate, I enjoyed the cake alot. It wasn't very sweet at all & of course I had to take it home.  I couldnt finish it all.   SERVICE (4 out of 5)  The hostesses were very professional.   Our server was sweet.  She was okay in the beginning but she got better as the night went on.  We normally dont require much attention as long as our water is refilled we are pretty much set for the rest of the night.    ATMOSPHERE (3.8 out of 5)  It was a busy night full of commotion and talks and laughter filled the room.  I enjoyed it.  I like the paintings/portraits on the wall and they had a locker for wine which was pretty cool.   OVERALL (4 out of 5) I liked it here, but it wont be my first choice that I would go to if I wanted to eat out."}
{"text":"I found this place after searching yelp for steak houses.  We made reservations and arrived on time, but had to wait another 15 minutes before we were seated.  As we walk down the corridor it seemed like a nice and calm place.  As we were escorted to the dining area, we notice the scene became much more lively, in a nice way.  The kitchen is viewable from anywhere you're seated and we sat somewhat in the center.  The kitchen reminds me of the one in Hell's Kitchen! Everything looked really nice; nice ambiance and food presentation.  Now, for the food.  We ordered the Wagyu beef carpaccio, clam chowder, lobster mac 'n' cheese and filet mignon.  Btw, the bread basket was good too...nice variety.  The beef carpaccio was OK...a little too much of the wasabi flavor.  The clam chowder and lobster mac 'n' cheese...MMMmmmm!!  Both were ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS (I also generally a fan of mac 'n' cheese)!!  However, I expected much more lobster in the mac 'n'cheese.  The filet mignon was alright; whatever sauce they plated the filet with was salty.  I asked for the meat to be cooked to Medium and it was still pretty juicy--I've had much better for about half the price.  If I was rating based on the main dish alone I would go with 3 stars.  The view, soup and mac 'n' cheese tipped me over to 4 stars.  Our server was super friendly as well.  It took awhile to get the bill, but it was a busy Saturday night."}
{"text":"Updating this review because the management handled it appropriately. As they shoukd for a regular customer.  I hope to continue to patronize this Capital Grille comically as we have for years."}
{"text":"Huh.  Dang.  Darn it.  Shoot.  I was really looking forward to lunch here.  Parking at this location is beyond ridiculous, no, I didn't valet cause I wanted to shop after wards.  But who cares?  I was here for a great meal!  Things started off well, great folks at the hostess desk.  Attractive interior, beautiful dark rich woods, attractive lighting, dark plantation blinds, very nice table.  My server Paula was extremely nice and had the cutest accent.  I liked a lot of the choices on the menu, but on an impulse, decided on the salad with filet medallions and onions straws.  The first bite of steak was extraordinary, perfectly cooked, wonderful seasonings and flavor.  Fresh pieces of asparagus in the salad was a nice surprise.  Then the shocker.  The next medallion was under cooked, the next was over cooked and the rest were grisley.  Needless to say, I could not eat it.  My server was very apologetic.  And then the manager immediately appeared as if he had been shot out of a canon.  He apologized profusely.  I was very understanding, I mean everyone has a bad day, right?   And of course he offered another dish, but I declined.  I mean, the mood was gone.  But then again, this is why I don't eat at home. The salad was taken off my check, as should be expected.  I did have dessert, hell yes, I was still hungry!  I got the hazelnut chocolate cake, which was totally awesome and even pretty to look at.  It was big enough to feed an army, don't know if it was a regular slice or if they were trying to make up for the salad.  So, a really mixed review.  I will try Capital Grill, again.  And I hope to have much better results."}
{"text":"Review Number 600 - I decided to take BJ out for a really special dinner on Father's Day.  He likes steak and seafood, so Capital Grille came to mind.  I made a reservation through open table.  When we arrived, the restaurant was very busy, but we were seated right away.  The decor is rich dark wood walls, extraordinary light fixtures, rich woven wool carpeting, and a few mounted animal heads and statues and old world type of artwork.  I am sure you get the picture.  For drinks, BJ opted for his usual beer and I had a Cosmo.  We had plenty of time to study the menu.  We decided to skip the appetizers and ordered a C.G. Chopped Salad to share.  I would call this a kitchen sink salad, it was full of a lot of different fresh vegetables, served on mixed greens with house made croutons and olive vinaigrette.  I really liked the salad, very fresh and delicious.  The bread basket here is great, it offers some nice choices of bread.    For our steaks, I got a filet mignon.  BJ got the seared tenderloins with butter poached lobster tails.  We decided to share the grilled asparagus based on our server's recommendation.  BJ loved his meal and that's what was important on this particular occasion.  He shared his lobster with me and it was perfectly cooked.  My steak, however was over cooked, tough and very dry.  It's a sin to see a filet prepared this way.  Also, our server seemed to be lost and didn't return to see if our steaks were cooked properly until well after BJ was done.  At that point, I wasn't really interested in a new steak.  But, as a reward for my suffering through a mediocre steak, we were given a free dessert.  Not exactly adequate, if you ask me, but better than nothing.  We got the cheesecake with seasonal berries.  It's described as the lighter, fluffier cousins of a New York.  Our server said it made with mascarpone and had a little crisp caramelized sugar ala creme brulee style, which was a nice touch.  The berries were raspberries, strawberries, blueberries and blackberries.  It was delicious.  We did have a really nice evening out.  But it's a shame that it couldn't have been perfect.  Inadequate service and a shoe leather steak prevented that.  We might try C.G., again.  But we have had such perfect meals at Morton's and Ruth Chris', we should probably stick with them."}
{"text":"Open up your brain tank because I'm about to pour in some high octane premium knowledge--  Have you ever walked out of a restaurant and felt like you didn't get your money's worth??  Have you ever walked out of a restaurant and felt like you wanted refinance your home, open up a restaurant house account, rent a cot in the back room, never ever leave, and never eat anything else again??  That is how I feel every time I exit Capital Grille after a meal.   Is it expensive?? Yes, but you are getting exactly what you pay for.. An exceptional meal and stellar customer service.  Everything about this place just exudes class and a stylish subtle comfort.    The menu is specific and gets right to the point.  There isn't a ton of options because this is what they do and they do it very very well.  First-Steak.  Second-Wine.  Third-Sides.  Fourth-Seafood.  I've had the Kona Bone-in Rib-eye and the Tenderloin with Lobster.  Both are so succulent that I get into a subconscious gladiatorial battle over which one to select.  No matter what you decide to go with, you should always choose the Lobster Mac N Cheese as a side.  WOW!  You are just being foolish if you don't.  Now, I am no wine connoisseur but the wine list is so extensive that it dwarfs the normal menu.  I'm talking about an endless amount of options and trust me when I tell you that your server will know about every single one.  So, just simply talk to him/her and tell them what you like or what suggestions they might have.  I think they have to go through some sort of wine school to become a server there.  They know all.    Now, I need to give this next Yelp nugget its own paragraph.  The truffle fries... Oh lordy Lord.... the truffle fries.  Fries so good that even touching them with ketchup or BBQ would be such a crime that I would \"soup nazi\" the rest of your meal.  \"NO CAP-G FOR YOU! - YOU DO NOT DESERVE THE CAP-G\"  Yeah, bringing it back to Seinfeld for that one.  They are hot, properly seasoned, and perfect just the way they are.  Get classy on those fries and use the fry tongs that they give you.  Don't be shy and indulge yourself in all that is the Capital Grille.     Please Enjoy!  -Ian M."}
{"text":"Capital grille is my favorite place to go for a special dinner. The food is always amazing. I LOVE their steak tartare. My filet was also perfectly rare. Our waiter Javier (if I remember his name correctly) provided excellent service."}
{"text":"Valet is awful! Re-parks your car in a garage to make you pay twice! The valet attendant said they have been doing this for a while to get over. Totally ridiculous!"}
{"text":"We - with my wife - had lunch at the Capital Grille (Camelback) on Wed April 4. We chose from their new \"Plates\" light menu... just to see what's all about. Had both the same choices: the White Cheddar Potato and Leek Soup (creamy, exquisitely delicious!), and the Grilled Jumbo Shrimp and Vegetable Couscous - a most generous portion (4 great shrimps), and an exquisite Couscous prepared better than on the Mediterranean shores where the dish originated (we should know, we spent many vacations there). Kudos to the Chef... My wife's desert (I abstained) was the Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake... absolutely out of this world, as she assured me! All in all a memorable (AND affordable) lunch - we decided to go back soon to sample the other \"Plates\" choices. Add to this the elegant, distinguished atmosphere, the sophisticated low-volume jazz/big-band (lots of Sinatra) piped in music, and last but not least, the impeccable service - who can ask for more? That's why we are going back for dinner in 10-days time!"}
{"text":"Capital Grille and I have a love-hate relationship.    Let's start with the good... the blue cheese lettuce wedge tugs on my heart strings.  I really love having this for lunch (and since I work uptown, I often do).  It's very fresh, the tomatoes are always very tasty, and the dressing is amazing!  Oh, the price isn't too bad either ($9).  As for their dinner menu, I love the au gratin potatoes and strawberry cheesecake!  The service is wonderful and the bartenders are generou (I've actually had to ask them to lighten up in the alchol in my mojitos a time or two).  Now, for the bad.  I recently tried the grilled chicken caesar salad and don't think I ever will again.  The lettuce was wilted, the dressing was very strong (hello anchovies) and the chicken wasn't fully cooked.  Hopefully the chef was having an off-day because an experience like this at Capital Grille isn't typical.    Overall, this is a great restaurant.  Perfect for a first date or anniversary.  Very cozy atmosphere and a great staff."}
{"text":"Eight of us went to Capital Grille last night for our \"Christmas Dinner\" since 4 of the eight will be traveling for Christmas elsewhere.  We picked Capital Grille for a really special occasion.  While it was nice, it didn't live up to what we have come to expect of Capital Grille in other locations, mainly Denver.  It started out when the waiter gave us an iPad to pick our wine.  That was a great idea to really have an up to date wine list.  No, the wine we ordered, and told what a nice pick it was by our server, was not in stock.  Server recommended another wine which was very good.  Ordered calimari appetizer that was excellent.  Then we ordered our main course.  Two of us ordered salmon oscar.  The salmon was very mediocre.  We should have known - it is a steak place after all!  The rest of us ordered steak.  Without exception, the steaks were over cooked.  One of which was so well done, it was sent back.  The situation was handled very well.  They brought out another steak, as well as hot sides to go with it!  Good recovery.  We ordered desert.  One of the orders was the chocolate/hazelnut cake.  The waiter came back, apologized that the baker that made the cake was not in an substituted flour less chocolate cake, and cheese cake.  He was old that my daughter-in-law didn't much care for the flour less cake but enjoyed the cheese cake.  Another nice recovery - he brought out another portion of cheesecake in a take home box for her.  Note: the coconut cream pie is to die for!  First, it was not the perfect evening one would expect for the prices charged.  Second, I am a business coach and I couldn't help thinking what these mishaps were costing the restaurant to try to make right.  It was just a matter of not paying attention to detail."}
{"text":"I ate here last week with my wife and my mom.  It's located on the upper level of the Fashion Show Mall.  The restaurant is very nice on the inside, and has windows throughout that overlook the strip.  I recommend asking for a seat by the window, as you will have a nice view.  I really can't say enough good things about the food here.  I believe this was my wife's favorite meal of the trip, and we were there for an entire week.  My wife and I split the caesar salad, while my mom got the spinach salad.   Each was very good.  You can definitely split the salad's, as one if almost too much for one person.  Each of us ordered the filet for dinner, along with a side of au gratin potatoes.  The filet was cooked perfectly and tasted great.  The au gratin potatoes were some of the best I've had.  For dessert, we couldn't decide what we wanted, but ended up ordering the cheesecake.  Since we were having a hard time deciding, our waitress was nice enough to bring a complimentary coconut cream pie.  Each dessert was phenomenal.  This place is 5 stars all the way.  While it's a little pricey, it's definitely worth it."}

{"text":"We had our anniversary dinner tonight at Capital Grill. The view was amazing, good ambience, and really good food. The service was a little sub par. Not bad, just not good. Our bill was $185($222 w/tip), the food was on par for that price but the service was on the level of a local casino's steak house. They were very slow refilling my water, it actually sat empty twice. I had a medium end glass of wine ($22) and she didn't ask me if I wanted another until was empty at the end of my meal. I would have liked another, but not when I'm done eating. She rarely checked on us, and she seemed almost put off by having to serve us. She did come around at the end, offering to take our picture and making small talk. Which was nice, but it was at the end of our meal, which was tip time:) There our a lot of very nice restaurants on the strip, it will be a while before we go back there."}
{"text":"Great food- finest Cognac-Great service.  No complaints"}
{"text":"We had a 7:00 reservation for a party of 6. When we arrived, they asked, do you mind sitting next to the kitchen. Come on CG, if you have to ask, you already know it is not acceptable.  After a bit they seated us at the perfect table. Sound level was perfect. Nice and quiet as hoped for. You can hear everyone in your party.  Food was excellent. Steaks, sides, appetizers, dessert, cocktails, everything  great."}
{"text":"By definition, I am not a fan of chain restaurants.  I would much rather support the independently owned ones - but Capital Grille was the exception to the norm.  I just went there for drinks with a friend and was blown away by the service. To begin with, if you sit at the bar....you are cordially poured complimentary Fiji water - which I thought was a really nice touch.  The interior is splendid with a combination of tables and booth and cozy lighting. They also have several private rooms and a chef's table. They even have private wine lockers for which you pay an annual fee and the restaurant then keeps tab of your preferences.  I just ordered a glass of Mumm Napa champagne and I couldn't believe that they kept refilling my glass ! That was the best $ 11.00 glass of champagne I ever drank.  Matt and Gregorio were our bartenders and were super friendly and professional. Matt even extended his business card telling us he would be happy to take care of us on our next visit.  Considering all the steakhouses in the valley, The Capital Grille made a very positive first impression on me and  I did not even eat there. Their menu is quite comprehensive and their wine list is unbelievable. We even got a little tour of the restaurant before leaving....Nice !  I look forward to my next visit and actually having dinner there!  Hmmmm....just don't tell them you know of someone who got free refills on their champagne...that could spell disaster...ah ah!"}
{"text":"High priced steak house the servers and wait staff was not up to par for this level of dining. Salty food, not simple clean food."}
{"text":"Great dinner in Charlotte!  To start, the service was perfection. David C was a rock star and gave us excellent reception recommendation and explanations. He was attentive and thoughtful the whole time. The jumbo lump crab cocktail was crazy good. It was just a bowl of jumbo lump crab with a seafood mustard on the side! It was delectable. I expected dull normal cocktail sauce and a few pieces of crab. It was far better than that. It was a feast!  The steaks were amazing as well. I had the bone in filet- which seemed part filet and part ribeye and was perfectly done. And my wife had the lobster and sliced filet. Once again, done to perfection. We had Brussels sprouts with bacon on the side, caramelized and crispy perfection as well. For desert we had an amazing coconut cream pie. It was decadence defined. Great job Capital Grille, and thank you David!"}
{"text":"need to update my last review.  not only is this one of my favorite spots to eat because of the food, customer service and atmosphere I just feel compelled to finish the review.  We just got a thank you note from our server Justin, who by the way was amazing, thanking us for coming in and dining with them. His note was sincere and appreciated.  I want to thanks Justin, manager Brian and chef Travis for a great night.  We will be back.  Other places should take note of customer service here and try to emulate them.  Try it and I do not think you will be disappointed.  Lee W  Scottsdale AZ"}
{"text":"Frozen potatoes? Are you kidding me? A high end restaurant like this one can not bring itself to cut fresh potatoes to make fries? I don't believe it!!! On top of that my med rare filet mignon was dry &  tasteless but the service & ambiance deserves 5 star."}
{"text":"I'm a fan....I got, I think it was a cajun rubbed filet (something like that) and it was great! Just about everything we had was above average to excellent.   It is kinda interesting for some reason it is dark in there...guess they don't want you to see the prices!  You get what you pay for and here for us it was worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent food & service! Pricey but worth it.  Had the filets.  Cooked the steaks perfectly!"}
{"text":"Just celebrated our 39th anniversary here and it was everything we expected. Had the stuffed lobster and it was perfect. Alex was our server and he took special care of us.  We had reservations and our table was ready with heart confetti and candles lit. The chef brought out a appetizer of scallops. After our meal they presented a special dessert with Happy Anniversary written in chocolate on the plate. It was a perfect meal to celebrate together."}
{"text":"Wow compared to the north Scottsdale location this place needs help. North scootsdale service and food service far superior   We sat near the bar in what they deem lounge seating. Don't do it. You're better off at the bar"}
{"text":"For Father's day I wanted to do something nice for my man. Although we do not have children he is a great fur baby daddy and a wonderful person. I was thinking of somewhere new to try ...but somewhere nice and The Capital Grille popped up in my head...so we went. We parked in the valet area which was the best choice ever. Pulled up and walked to the elevator which took us straight to the restaurant. I have to say it was extremely beautiful. Great ambiance. We were sat at a table that was near the window which over looked the strip. They started us off with a basket of mixed types of bread and butter and then we had the mozzarella wrapped with prosciutto, tomatoes, basil and balsamic vinaigrette as an appetizer.  My man had the bone in rib eye with a butter glaze and I had the swordfish topped with crab. We shared grilled asparagus and scalloped potatoes.  I know a steak is good for my man when he does not grab the salt and pepper. He said it was delicious, tender and cooked to perfection.  My swordfish and crab was delicious. The swordfish was cooked perfectly. The lemon sauce over it was subtle but flavorful. The crab was piled high on top of the fish. I am so glad I ordered it and I would definitely order it again. The asparagus was grilled just right with a half of a lemon on the side. The potatoes au gratin were amazing, cheesey and the portion was huge. There was so much food we took a huge goodie bag home.  From the food, the service and the ambiance this place was a home run! We will definitely be back! Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"This is honestly one of the best if not THE BEST restaurants I've every been to! I've been coming here for years and it's still my go to steak house! The service is always spot on and very professional and, everyone is also very friendly! I recommend their French onion soup, it's the best I've ever had and I've had French onion soup all around the world! For an entree I recommend the seared ahi tuna it's my favorite...I rarely switch it up but if I do I get the filet mignon with the aged balsamic on it. Would highly recommend this place to anyone in Scottsdale. Hands down the best steak house."}
{"text":"I got an email about Administrative Professionals Day at this location and if you had lunch or dinner there they would give a $50 giftcard to them in honor of the day. I coordinated with some people form my office to take our 2 girls there for Lunch.  I made a reservation and when we got there everything was set up. Before we even started dining they presented the giftcards to the girls and they were extremely excited.  We all enjoyed our meal, our server was great, and everyone was happy.  We totally will go back! Great experience!"}
{"text":"The service was great and the server was informative and amusingly enthusastic about the food, especially the appetizers.  For a fancy place the prices were unexpected, meaning lower than I expected due to the fanciness.  ie - dry aged steak for $25"}
{"text":"We had a great time on Saturday night celebrating my husband's birthday. Not only did we get the table we requested for the evening, but the staff had decorated our table and personally wished him a Happy Birthday as well as surprised us with a lovely dessert for the occasion. Peter, our waiter, helped us make an excellent wine selection that went well with our steaks (the Delmonico for him and tenderloin with lobster for me!). Don't miss out on the sides to share either- all of them are delicious!"}
{"text":"I really like the Capital Grille.  Old school all the way. Quintessential Las Vegas Steakhouse.  Amazing views of the strip.  A very competent staff.  Been here for lunch a few years ago (Grille's Signature Cheeseburger, awesome!) and dinner just the other day.  Stoli Doli Aka Pineapple Martini.  I think I could have drank 4 or 5 of these if I had no self control.  Delicious, and they go down easy.  French Onion Soup Sweet onions under melted cheeses.  Rich beef broth. Really good.  Wedge with Bleu Cheese and Smoked Bacon Cool Iceberg Lettuce with thick bacon chunks and grape tomatoes.  Great dressing.  Split it, it would be too much for just one person unless that's all your eating.  I saw some pretty awesome looking lobster tails on Yelp and tried to order one to split.  The waiter said all they have were the small ones poached in butter they serve with the Seared Tenderloin.   They were pretty good and only cost $11.00 each.  Porcini Rubbed Bone-In Ribeye with 15-Year Aged Balsamic Here's where we get a little sideways with dinner.  So this is their signature steak.  My GF and I both didn't like the 15-Year Aged Balsamic.  It pretty much took over the Ribeye and put it in a headlock.  The vinegar was too sweet and overpowered what was a great steak.  I know, just my opinion.  Some folks seem to love it.  My advice, get it on the side if you must.  Our waiter took it back and they took off most of the Balsamic.  It was better, but you could still taste the vinegar.  I'd go with the Bone-In Ribeye - 22 oz next time.  Sides of Au Gratin Potatoes and Sautéed Spinach with Garlic Confit were on point.  No room for dessert.  The Capital Grille rocks."}
{"text":"One of the best steakhouse experiences that I have ever had in my life!  If you have not been to The Capital Grille, I suggest highly that you go soon. This was an experience, and I am not trying to exaggerate. Everything was superb, from the service, to the food, and the ambiance this place does not disappoint in any way.   My bestie can now calm down, I (finally!) tried the lobster mac n cheese, as it has been recommended by friends and Yelpers alike, and I must say I'm a huge fan! I usually only use the word decadent for desserts, however this dish is savory & decadent at the same time, definitely would go back for lunch to have it as a meal on it's own. Yes, it was that good.   Our steaks were cooked perfectly, we ordered a Filet Mignon & Dry Aged NY Strip Au Poivre & Couvoisier Cream, taste wise, goodness, all I can say is that these were 2 of the best steaks that we have ever enjoyed.    The service was impeccable, for me to say that, it meas a lot. I was a server in high school & college as well, so I know great service, I also know that I am a high maintenance customer, like I can easy drink 4 glasses of water with dinner, and I always find myself needing something else, extra dressing, another glass of wine, something, you feel me, and this place has excellent service, we never felt forgotten, yet never bothered either.  Desserts, wow, what can I say, other than please save room to at least share one item, and I would highly recommend the Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake, I only wish that I had taken an additional slice with me, as 1 slice was not enough for this chocoholic, haha.  5 Stars all around. You must go soon!"}
{"text":"We spent my birthday here and it was amazing. It was the right choice for a special occasion like this one. We had a reservation and the host brought us to our table where it was designed to show they were making my birthday unforgettable.  From the birthday design on the table, the handwritten birthday card to the birthday wishes at the end of the meal, everything was perfect. Our server Michael M. was upbeat and attentive. The food choices were good. It took us almost 15 Min to choose our entree coz everything sounded so good. The crab cake and calamari appetizers were so good! Our entrees tasted amazing. Best steak I have tried in a long time. I got the Tenderloin with lobster which was cooked to perfection. Everything was just right. It was a little pricey but was worth it all. The view of the strip was just the right ambience too. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We went here on a Thursday evening when we were in town for business. We didn't have a reservation and it appeared very busy. Little did we know there were two major concerts in town that night. I have had occasions like this dining out where the host or hostess would be snobby about the situation. That was far from the case here. Despite the hectic, busy night we were treated very well. There were no tables available but we were offered full service dining at the bar. David, the bartender, was fantastic. We had the lobster and crab cakes along with the steak tartar. The serving sizes were larger than I expected. Both appetizers were amazing. We then ordered one entree (the veal) to split with a side of lobster Mac & Cheese.  I thought maybe we would be charged a sharing fee, but we weren't. They even split the entree for us onto two plates. Service was great. Food was great. I'd love to go back again!"}
{"text":"Pricey but in a great location with great views. Their food is always very-very good (though, in that area, nothing beats Ruth's Chris). What sets them apart from many others is their calamari (has a Thai red pepper-type sauce on it). It's mouth-watering and amazing. You must get it when you go here. I suggest reservations - it's definitely one of the more popular upscale restaurants. They offer a great brunch too."}
{"text":"my filet mignon was grilled to perfection. the chocolate hazelnut cake was to die for. and the bottle of silver oak was as good as ever.  mix that in with great company and beautiful vegas lights...what more could a girl ask for?  :)"}
{"text":"Really fabulous meal for a special occasion. We celebrated my husband's birthday and they made him feel very special. Confetti and a card on the table and champagne toast to begin the meal. Classy.  You pick drinks off an iPad which is fun. Drinks were very good.   We had the lobster bisque to start & it was the best I've probably ever had. Big chunks of lobster too.  I had the filet mignon as my main course & honestly it we not the best I've had. The flavor was not there for me. My husband's ribeye was good though. The au gratin and mushroom sides were delicious. Their au gratin is rich & fancy so I recommend over mashed potatoes.    They brought out a special desert for my husband, chocolate torte and a little cheesecake and they were divine. We could barely eat we were so full!   Our server Amber was amazing and made our dinner truly special. She took two pictures of us and they printed them & that was a very nice touch. Her positive spirit could make any meal enjoyable!  She was well over a 5 star server.   Great place to go for a special occasion but be ready because it's expensive."}
{"text":"A steak house we've all been to a thousand times.  For a chain, not bad to bet on consistency but don't sit at the bar long because it will cost you.  A round of drinks (5) for $130 is not my idea of fun.  Big steaks, big sides but avoid the beaten path and try something new!"}
{"text":"Everything about the Capital Grille was fantastic. Except the food.  The ambiance, the service, the decor, the fine little touches that go along with a high-end restaurant were all exactly what you would expect from the CG, but unfortunately, the food just didn't live up to expectations.  I went for lunch and was looking forward to something as spectacular as the rest of the experience, and was horribly disappointed.  The clam chowder was average at best, and definitely wasn't anywhere near as good as some I've had at bar/restaurants on the pier in San Fran or Seattle.  And although I can't remember the name of the sliced steak dish with the shoestring fries on top, that's a pretty accurate description of the dish itself.  The steak itself was horrible, as it had a completely inedible piece running through the center of the entire steak. I ate around it, but seriously, this is not what I expect from a place like the CG.  It completely ruined the rest of the experience, and it's doubtful I'll ever go back for another lunch.    You never get a second chance to make a first impression.  Sorry, CG, but it wasn't a good one."}
{"text":"I went to the Capital Grill for the first time this weekend and I was very impressed! I've been to STK, Maestro's Steakhouse, Dominick's, etc but I had never really heard much about Capital Grill, so I didn't know if it could compete. Well, it definitely did and it was very good!  I ordered the filet mignon and it was cooked to the perfect medium rare that I requested. We ordered sautéed spinach and mushrooms for sides - I really liked the way they did the mushrooms. For dessert we had the Crème Brûlée and Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake. The Crème Brûlée was creamy and fantastic. The Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake was super rich and awesome.  The Captial Grill totally impressed me and I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"By far one of the biggest disappointments we have been through in a long time - with a big ticket attached to it. We went here for my birthday dinner and it was one of the worse meals I've had in a long time. I ordered the Chef's special - a steak served with shrimp on top, served scampi style. This came out on a plate with gigantic grilled shrimp on top. The shrimp were actually really good. Which is sad when it's suppose to compliment the steak. The steak, which is drowning in this scampi (greasy buttery sauce) is completely bland and has no taste - like not even seasoned with salt and pepper. Appears as if the Chef thought hey, all this greasy buttery sauce will cover up the need to season this piece of meat! I would expect this from a Denny's restaurant after a night of clubbing while in college - not for a nice sit down restaurant. I think I've had better steak at Outback Steakhouse. My boyfriend had the filet on the bone. It came out looking like a barbaric slab of meat from the stone ages - again the most bland seasoning you've ever experienced with a steak! Thank God this place had A-1 steak sauce to save grace - he drowned his steak in this to give it some flavour. Pretty sad when you have to ask for steak sauce at a fine dining establishment. Typically a good steak, seasoned and cooked well would require NO additional sauces used so that you could enjoy the full flavour - well this is not the case at this restaurant since the steaks have NO flavour at all. We ordered sides of lobster mac and cheese - this was good with big chunks of lobster. The potatoes were bland and unimpressive. The 2 impressive things about this place were the calamari for starters and the free cheesecake birthday dessert. The waitress gave us each one refill of our drink (I had soda and he had ice tea). The cups were literally the size of a kids cup - towards the end, she didn't even stop to ask if we would care for a refill - we must have hit our 2 drink maximum. Overall, a truly disappointing dinner experience for a hefty price tag of over $190 - with no alcoholic beverages. To pay this price for dinner and still walk out hungry is sad. Save your money if you want mediocre steak - go to Texas Roadhouse. If you're willing to spend the big bucks and want a good steak - go to Flemings or Mortons. Wouldn't come back here again...even for a free meal."}
{"text":"Is this even a surprise!? Exceptional everything. From my perfectly medium rare fillet to the lobster mac and cheese to the truffle fries. If you don't go for anything else, please oh please GO FOR THE LOBSTER MAC AND CHEESE!!!!! The service is just as exceptional as the meal."}
{"text":"Top Notch steaks and service.  My recommendation (if you're really hungry) order the Porterhouse...medium rare.  And please pay the few extra dollars for the Porcini Rub - you'll thank me...   Table 23 is one of the best for privacy if you have 3 to 4 joining you.."}
{"text":"Metiocre at best. We were looking at reviews for restaurants with dry age steak's. Capital Grille had great overall reviews and great reviews for their dry aged, so we decided to give it a try. We also had the lobster tail, Caesar salad and a side of brussels sprouts. Everything was just all right, nothing amazing or special. I had heard so much talk about how great this fancy restaurant was over the years. Disappointing and definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"The Capital Grille was a great experience overall.  The staff was extremely welcoming and courteous.  I had let them know it would be a first date experience and they pulled out all the stops.  They chose a very romantic table setting and the service was terrific.  The waiter was a little overly friendly and was a bit uncomfortable toward the end of the meal. The setting, environment, and welcoming staff were the highlights.  For the price I felt the food could have been better.  For starters we ordered mozzarella and tomato salad and the Caesar.  The salads were both chilled, crisp, and the vinegar and spice balance for the mozzarella was very good. For the entrees we got the salmon and the special bleu cheese encrusted fillet with grilled shrimp.  The salmon was cooked perfectly, but lacking on seasoning.  Where they were short on flavor on the salmon they made up for on the shrimp.  They definitely weren't shy with the seasoning which left something to be desired for the surf of the turf.  The steak was cooked to perfection and was extremely tender.  The waiter had sold the bleu cheese as a cream base infused with pepper and garlic.  Unfortunately it was just a few morsels of blue cheese pressed into the top of the meat.  Still, a VERY good cut of steak. The meal and a bottle of wine ran me $150 which for the service and ambience I believe is fair.  I'll most definitely be going back to give the chef another chance to WOW me."}
{"text":"Took our friend who is leaving town for a new job to The Capital Grille last night, and WOW we were impressed!  Not only was the food delicious, but we were treated incredibly well by the staff, particularly our server Rebecca... I truly felt like a VIP!!  Our meal included a complimentary amuse bouche (a cucumber slice filled with a lobster salad), and when our friend informed the staff that he's allergic to shellfish, they immediately produced an alternate dish for him.    The salad I split with my fiance was a fresh mozzarella/basil/tomato/balsamic salad.  The server split this tableside for us, and even brought an extra plate with the 12 yr aged balsamic and EVOO drizzle.  Delicious.  For the entree, I temporarily suspended my usual vegetarian-pescatarian diet for a Filet Oscar (filet with crab served on top).  Medium rare as requested, as was my fiance's delmonico.  Again, delicious.  I should also mention here that the potatoes au gratin side dish were phenomenal and highly recommended.  At the end of the meal, we were presented with a complimentary champagne toast and four mini \"pot o' creme\" desserts.  These were incredible and somewhat like a ganache.    We finished our experience with another bottle of champagne and three desserts to share between the four of us:  chocolate hazelnut cake, cheesecake, and creme brulee.  I have to say that this cheesecake is some of the best I've had and it has to to with the crust and the creme-brulee-like topping.  Definitely a must-try if you order dessert on your visit.  Our desserts were also on the house, in honor of our friend's job and my fiance and I's recent engagement.  This meal was probably the best all-around I've had in Charlotte, and perhaps anywhere.  Excellent food, outstanding service."}
{"text":"Went for friend's birthday, my first time. The service was amazing, they went above and beyond to ensure we had an amazing dining experience. They brought out a bread basket to start, I highly reccomend the bread with the carmelized onions on top. We both ordered the current special of Waygu burger and glass of wine for $25 (we chose the Silver Oak Cab) served with parm. truffle fries. Burger was juicy and very flavorful.. served on a perfectly toasted bun with an overeasy egg and soft butter lettuce. We got a side of their dijion mustard and it was a perfect compliment to the burger. No need for ketchup for the burger or fries for sure. Dessert was a flourless espresso chocolate cake (friend loved it, I dont 'do' coffee) and a 'not-NY style' (as the server put it) cheesecake with a brulee top served with fresh berries. The food and the service made dining here an 'experience'... the price point is on the higher side (IMO!) so if you would normally not spend that for dinner I would definately reccomend for a special occasion... it will be my go-to spot for birthdays for sure!"}
{"text":"Went there  for the third time. The food was mediocre but the service was horrible! We were there for a birthday party however the wait staff did not pay attention to us I don't know if it's because we were The minority inside the steakhouse however we spent so much money and since you were there for a birthday we thought we would be taking care of a little bit better than we did. I have to say since I am vegetarian they recommended the veggie platter and it was pretty amazing."}
{"text":"Am I the only person who likes their meat well-done? Am I the only person who doesn't realize everyone around you wants to yell at you for giving the waiter a well-done answer? Who cares. I like my meat well done. I don't like the taste of blood swirling in my mouth and any hint of it even if it's at medium well will make me have a hard time swallowing it. I will chew that sucker like gum until i realize this is getting disgusting.   Okay onward...I had the filet mignon with the mash potatoes and it was delicious! Even at well done that thing filet mignon'd. That doesn't make sense, but I just wanted to type that. What I'm saying is, just because m y cut of steak was thoroughly cooked...it did not fall short of what we know of filet mignon to be. It was yumgasmic and my carnivorous side was awoken. Like butter to carve into. Nothing fell short in my meal, except for the key lime pie I opted to try. I never had it. Twas my first time and I swear it tasted literally like a key...squirted with lime...made into a pie. Hence, key lime pie. I don't have anything to compare it to other than I will never eat a key lime pie for as long as I live. I will order a filet mignon rare (gulp) if I had a choice between the two.   With that said...CG did not disappoint (unless you're coming for key lime pie and expecting it to not taste like a key...lime...pie). Service was wonderful! While there are other great steakhouses in and along the boulevard...it's nice that this one isn't tucked into one of the casinos.   A definite potential for steak option along the strip. Certainly recommend! I'd leave the kids at home on this trip, though!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Classy ambiance with excellent food and wine list. Parking was really bad though! The parking lot was full and my brothers really had to hoof it.  Burrata was yummy, as was the creamed spinach and Parmesan truffle frIes. I didn't adore my salmon but I was full.  Service was great. The view to the north is an empty building site, to the east Wynn casinos. We will definitely go back and recommend it."}
{"text":"In a bit of an indifferent mood before ending up at TCG I did the drivers equivalent of pacing.  Litterally driving into the parking lot of a few other well known restaurants and going \"no...not feeling it\", and driving out of the parking lot without stopping.   I was intent on trying some place new.  Honestly I don't know what made me park and come into TCG, and even then when I walked in I was about ready to turn around, I wasn't wanting so upscale but decided to just go in and grab a seat at the bar.   My indeciseiveness that night extended into trying to choose what to drink and what to eat.  The bartender and the lady sitting next to me highly recommend the Stoli Doli, house infused pineapple vodka martini.  Why not? What a great recommendation.  Wonderfully simple, slightly sweet pineapple goodness in a martini glass.   Looking over the bar menu, I then asked for the full menu.  Wow the Wine list is IMPRESSIVE.  The menu options matched the rich darkness in the restaurant.  Sultry and romantic...I can see why there were so many couples here enjoying the ambiance.  The service is as impressive as the wine list. I finally decided, but I question my own combination of what I chose.  Obviously not that hungry, I choose the Wagyu beef carpaccio and a wedge salad( this is where I wonder what was I thinking).  I would have much happier in the end had I just had the carpaccio.   Not that it was bad....just so didn't do the restaurant justice.   It's not ment to stand out on its own.  But it satisfied something at the moment.  The rich blue cheese dressing and bacon...unfortunately iceburg lettuce is never stellar even with the dressing. The Wagyu carpaccio was beautifully plated.  Lightly seared exterior and rare interior of thinnly sliced beef accompanied by a portion of lightly dressed arugula salad and parmagian cheese.   The seared exterior had a seasoning that I am not sure that added to the dish.  I appreciate carpaccio for its simplicity. However that was my only \"issue\" and it didn't keep me from enjoying the dish.  The richness of the wagyu and the peppery arugula were perfect together.  Including tip my vist was around $50. Next time I will go with a friend or 3 who are ready for a fine meal."}
{"text":"This place is amazing came here to celebrate my birthday,  the atmosphere is very fancy and classic. We were greeted by our waiter Ben he was so nice and helpful and made our experience lovely. I ordered the steak medallions and lobster tail and my boy friend ordered the Porter house steak both meal were cooked to perfection melt in ur mouth kinda of meal. The dessert was to die for had the cheese cake I highly recommend this place and I will be back thank you capital grille for an amazing birthday experience. Ben was awsome !!!"}
{"text":"As a long-time customer I always love this place !! the food wine and service are consistently excellent. If something isn't prepared to your liking .. mention it..and  they will completely redo it the way you asked. Bar staff and management are awesome..   I generally eat in the bar area or at the bar..the GM  and assistant manager make it a point to always come by and say hello.   Around Business hours people are dressed from work as well into the evening however casual attire is also welcomed... at least in the bar area..   Now that weather is cooler patio dining with your dog is welcomed.  This has to be one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"I ate here with Abu J a while back and had a tasty lunch of a sirloin sandwich and mashed potatoes.  While hardly dietetic, it was tasty and even left me some lunch for the next day.  The steak was nice and rare, grilled onions and potatoes mashed more in the french style, a little gluey, but in a good way.  Tasty.  Abu J had his usual cheeseburger (though no anymore).  I'm sure I'll be here again sometime as he has his \"paper route\" and doesn't care much to deviate from it."}
{"text":"This is the first fancy steakhouse I've been too and it was everything that I imagined it to be. Elegant decor, top notch service and exquisite food.   My boyfriend and I shared a porterhouse steak, lobster mac and cheese, truffle fries, soy glazed Brussels sprouts and 2 cups of the French onion soup and the clam chowder.   EVERYTHING TASTED SO GOOD. You actually don't feel bad about the price you're paying for the food! The steak melts in your mouth and the sides were all super delicious. They also give you four varieties of bread! (Don't be like me and get full off of bread before all the food comes out)!! I almost died and went to heaven!! This would be the last meal I'd want to have!!!!  Overall had an amazing experience and I will definitely be returning :D"}
{"text":"I loved eating here. Both, the food and service were great."}
{"text":"Visited tonight. 1 steak came out cold , the other kona crusted was tough and in a completely flavorless sauce. If you are going to call yourself a steakhouse then I think I think you should be better than Outback!!!  Not even able to watch Pittsburgh Penguins on TV in a Pittsburgh steakhouse !!  Former regulars who will never go back, just ripped off tonight."}

{"text":"I have been a patron of The Capital Grille's Biltmore location for roughly a decade, but this was my first visit to this location in North Scottsdale. The ambience is traditional and classy, but a little loud and pretty energetic. Unless you're in a booth or private room, there's not a lot of privacy.  As always, the food was fantastic. We had a wide range of items, but the lobster tails and creamed corn were standouts.   To be honest, though, the service was spotty. I believe that the best qualities of a steakhouse other than food quality are personalized service (e.g. waiter knows your name and remembers what you were drinking) and the attentiveness of the waiter (e.g. sees when you need refills, etc). Exceptional service is the only thing that makes me never regret the price of the meal or question the value of the experience. If the waiters weren't spread so thin at this location, the service might someday qualify as \"five-star.\" That being said, our waiter was very professional and pleasant when he was around.  All in all, I enjoyed it and hope to return soon."}
{"text":"Probably the best restaurant I've been to in a while!! Went with a group of friends got the surf and turf, with the lobster mac and cheese and it was one of the best experiences Ive had eating out. I love the staff and the ambiance was very romantic and warm, perfect for special occasions. Will go back very soon"}
{"text":"2nd visit to CLT location, great meal.  Took kids and the staff was quite accommodating and friendly.  Steak was wonderful....mushrooms were as well.  Kinda pricey but you get a quiet, nicely lit table...in some swank ambience....not for the vegetarians or faint of heart with the $$$$.  After a rainy day at the Discovery Place, I'd go back.  As good as Sullivan's...just a bit more stuffy...but not overly so."}
{"text":"Beyond delicious. Lots more food that you would the filet and scalloped potatoes were my favorite. The server and manager were very attentive and friendly. My husband had never been there before so it was quite a treat. A classy and delicious place to come for a special evening. We will be back."}
{"text":"This review is well overdue.  I came here to take my attorneys out for a good dinner that turned bad. The Capital Grille is known to be a great steak house but they totally missed the mark; at least when I was there.  Long story short, I ordered the Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry Aged NY Strip \"MEDIUM\" and some parts were good but the majority of it was rare. I sent it back to get it redone and it came in looking burnt. The manager was kind enough to take this steak off the check but it just left a bad taste in my mouth.   Note: If you are a well known upper class steak house, please know how to cook your steaks. The way you cook steak is an art and can make or break even the best tasting steaks."}
{"text":"This place can get packed at dinner time. My wife and I came in and we were seated right away. They know a lot about pairing wine with the foods you are ordering. They brought out an iPad with their wine menu and boy do they have a lot of wines to select from. We started with French onion soup which was over salted and had to send it back. We asked for another one to be made but they said it would be the same as it is made from the same broth. We ordered a Caesar salad and it was delicious. Next came out the steak and it was very tender. Prices are  a bit pricey but what do you expect? It's Vegas and all restaurants are pricey. Overall the food was good and I would come back."}
{"text":"D-Lish!  I met a friend there for dinner and arrived before him. They promptly sat me 20 minutes prior to our reservation time.  When he arrived they had his drink ready almost instantaneously from when he sat down. (Yes, I told the waiter what he would be drinking in advance...but he remembered and was astute to when my date arrived.)  We both ordered the filet mignon. Although they switched around our plates when they served them to us, we were able to switch them around. That was the only \"meh\" of the evening, I thought.  However, it wasn't a problem in the bigger picture.  Todd was our server and he was friendly and casual enough for us while providing us excellent customer service and attention.  We also ordered the asparagus and mashed potatos to share. Both great side dishes.  No dessert for us -- we went for drinks at Elements (Sanctuary Resort) afterwards...also a great night cap."}
{"text":"This place hit the mark. Portion size was generous, food was delicious. The views at night are really nice. Not the fanciest restaurant but a great time. Had the scallops - well cooked and large. Filet minon - tender cut. Sweet corn and bacon side - a-maz-ing. The creme brulee cheesecake was smooth and delicious as well. Not a single complaint for the money."}
{"text":"Came for a lunch work event and had the cheese wrapped in prosciutto, lobster and crab burger, along with potatoes and vegetables. The service was great, and the food was delicious. I will defineitely be back!"}
{"text":"BY FAR our favorite dinner location! We had the specials; bone-in filet mignon and lobster tail!! EVERYTHING melted like butter and the preparation was done to perfection. To top it off, they say us in the very corner window table and the view was so beautiful. Our server Alex was just so great! Knowledgable, sincere, and generous! He bought us dessert because he knew we would say \"no\" if he asked. Lol. What a wonder man, AND FROM LBC! :)  We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend, took my husband here for his birthday. Everything was amazing from start to finish. They even helped us celebrate his birthday with dessert and a toast. Any issues that may arise, they take care of! I didn't even have to ask for assistance, the staff just knew I needed something. This establishment is first class, and classy. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My husband says they have the best steaks in town and he is a meat lover. I think the place is beautiful and elegant. Service is always beyond excellent and everything on the menu is delicious."}
{"text":"This was a great choice.  We were looking for a good steakhouse and found it here.  To start, we got seated right at the window looking north up the strip, and we could see the Wynn and Encore across the street.  It might have been romantic, if I wasn't dining with a couple other guys...  The ambiance was nice - like a quiet version of Fleming's with a touch of the Rat Pack.  Paintings of notable faces from the old days of Vegas hung on the walls in various corners of the restaurant.  Speaking of Fleming's, the menu resembled theirs in format and pricing.  The service was exceptional - very attentive, but not overbearing.  I got the lamb chops, which were outstanding!  I ordered med-rare, and they came very pink and warm - perfect!  They served it with a cherry compote, which was a perfect compliment - I'm not a fan of the mint jelly that often accompanies lamb.  One of my friends ordered the Delmonico steak, which is a 22 oz bone-in ribeye.  All of their beef is dry-aged in-house.  As good as my lamb was, I was coveting that steak, and he said it was great.  I will return to this establishment and enjoy another great meal on my next trip."}
{"text":"Elegantly amazing!  Served promptly with a cordial smile by the hostess.  Dim lighting with a prestigious ambience of a masculinely formal decor. Decadent array of selections ranging from land to sea. The seafood platter was perfectly chilled with seasonings to delight your palette. The wine menu had many choices from different regions that allowed pairing from afar to local blends. The chef selection of bone in rib eye was perfectly cooked to medium and the lamb was so tasty that there was no gamy flavoring in them. The dessert menu was to die for! I'd pick the double chocolate cake.   Our waitress Katie provided great service with proper etiquette which holds high stars in my book with the use of proper verbiage of please and thank you's!   Highly recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a dinner date with my best friend here during restaurant week.  I've never been to Capital Grille so I was excited to try it out.  I have only heard good things so I can't say that I wasn't a little disappointed with a few things...  I thought it would be safe to try a place like CG for Restaurant week because it is truly a chance to get more bang for your buck.  However, I am pretty sure everything switched once we said we were there for Queens Feast.  The server had been so polite and accomidating up until the point of our decision to order from the Queen's Feast.  After that moment I don't think we saw him the rest of the night, not even to bring us our food.  Seriously!  You may think I am kidding but I'm not!  He brought us bread with literally only 2 small rolls in the basket.  We had bread envy because we could see all the other tables with with bountiful bread baskets!  We figured it was because there was only two of us but the other tables only had two people as well but they had way more!  Well, we ended up asking for more bread and he never brought it.  We asked the other gentleman that was supposed to be assisting with our table as well and he brought it about 15 minutes later.    Our glasses of water were empty the majority of our time there. We both ordered Filet Mignon which was very tasty.  It was warm, not hot when it came out but still very tender and nicely flavored.  We both ordered it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly.  Two sides came with our meal and I think they were supposed to be family style but they were really what you would see if they were served on an individual plate.  The mashed potatoes were sticky/gummy and lukewarm.  They were served in the smallest family style portion I have ever seen.  Unless it was a small family of ants, I would say we got screwed on the potatoes.  The string beans were cold and hard (undercooked) and inedible.  Didn't touch them.  The desserts were decent.  The flourless chocolate cake was so rich it was unbearable.  It was the dark bitter chocolate flavor that just wasn't very good.  The small bite of cheesecake was good though.  Just....small.  Overall, I would say this experience was subpar, especially for the reputation of the restaurant.  Why does service and quality AND quantity have to suffer because it is restaurant week?  They did all seem overly busy so I understand that everything isn't going to be perfect but we didn't even see our waiter the rest of the evening until he flung our check at us.  I guess I would say it was just overall disappointing.  The steak saved the day.  That was some darn good steak.  Not in a hurry to come back....other competitors have won my heart."}
{"text":"Classy, modern with an old school feel.  Awesome views, great food and romantic!  The staff is ultra friendly and the steaks are prepared perfectly.  Located in Fashion Show Mall, this upscale chain really delivers."}
{"text":"Bad food and terrible service.  Went here during restaurant week with a large group of friends and everyone was disappointed.  The service was slow and disrespectful and I'm not sure I would have fed my rubber steak to the dog.  I'm not one to go out of my way to write a bad review unless the place really deserves it, and sadly this \"steakhouse\" certainly does due to the quality of food, price and service. Don't do it, try City Hall."}
{"text":"Came here while a friend was visiting (plus I had a 50 dollar gift certificate....SWEET!) The food was AMAZING. But I'll start back from the beginning.  We showed up and parking was terrible, but luckily...free Valet! Score! We valeted the car, and since we had a reservation...; were taken straight to the table. Whatever you do, get a reservation. This place was packed and is ALWAYS packed on the weekends. MAKE A RESERVATION, unless you like living dangerously. I just cant wait when I'm hungry.  The crowd here is older. Um, much older. My friend and I came in our mini dresses, headed to old town scottsdale afterwards and everyones faces were like 0____o hahahaha The average age here had to be 55.  They have an extensive wine list from all over, also, a lot of smaller wineries (which I liked).  The bread basket here is amazing, and thats coming from the girl who loves any kind of carb. Its an assortment of breads.  I ordered the salmon which was cooked to perfection and my friend and I split the garlic mashed potatoes.  I WISH I COULD OF SWAM IN THEM. The best mashed potatoes I've ever had."}
{"text":"Excellent meal and service.    Shrimp Cocktail -  very good standard shrimp cocktail   Oysters -  Fresh and delicious   Crab and Lobster cake - this was the best dish of the night.  It is a must get.  This is really a crab cake with a piece of lobster claw on top.  That being said it was great.  Steak Tartar -  biggest disappointment of the night.  It was served in a classic manner with everything deconstructed.  I prefer when I don't have to mix everything together myself.    Bone in ribeye -  perfectly cooked Medium Rare.  It was great!  Service was impressive.  Very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Impeccable service. Delmonico Steak is the best steak in town. Ask for John the manager and he'll help you pair an awesome bottle of wine. Great ambiance as well."}
{"text":"This place has just recently opened up and it's second location in Ohio. I have been there twice since they opened. One for a date and another for a birthday. Both times with excellent experience. The service was amazing, and the food was phenomenal. I had the steak and lobster entrée which was to die for, it was also a large portion. Make sure to order the mozzarella and tomato salad (basically a caprese salad) with this in-house made yummy mozzarella, and with aged balsamic vinaigrette. Their steak was just perfect too with the perfect amount of seasoning. I would say it's the best steak house around, since I have been to both XO steakhouse and Red's."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for my b-day here and we still had to wait 15 minutes at the bar. That is the only bad thing I can say about our visit and why it didn't get 5 stars (since I hate waiting).  Our drinks ordered at the bar were free and were taken to our table which had candies all over it and a birthday card with well wishes. Our view was amazing since we were seated in a booth that looked out to the Wynn. Everything was cooked to our liking: buttery steak, mushrooms, and mashed potatoes. Lovely dinner at a classic steak restaurant. I'd return but probably to their LA location for a special occasion since it's a bit pricey."}
{"text":"I could have eaten at least million million mini crab and lobster burgers, each with a side of the unbelievably delicious spicy calamari...oh, and don't forget the truffle fries.     Those were my favorite items, but the beef tenderloin burgers, mini lobster rolls and red pepper soup weren't far behind.  I was too full to try to dessert, and it sounds like I missed out on something really special.  What I did not miss out on was the drinks.  In fact, I tried one of everything (possibly more than one of a couple).  The red wine was remarkable and the cocktails were out of this world.    I felt like I had just left the Oscar's when I got home and checked out the contents of my swag bag.  Two free lunches...what??  And two free Stoli Dolis to go with those lunches.  Hell yeah!  Don't forget about the golf tees, chocolates, mints and pen.  To top it all off, my favorite thing about elite events, I had the pleasure of meeting new Yelpers and catching up with those I already know.  Robert L. and Shaina T. and Maggie F., you guys rock!    Also...can I just say that the ice sculpture kicked ass!  A huge thanks to Lindsey and Gabi for putting together this amazing event.  Lots of love to Nader for capturing it all on film so we can remember just how good we Elites have it for years and years to come.  And last but certainly not least, hats off the the Capital Grille staff.  They wined us and dined us from the moment we set foot in their house, and treated us as honored guests until the last of us departed.  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Expectations set...you know what you're going to get. Or do you?  Hostess - Unnecessary. Overly exuberant greeting, gushing about the weather, awkwardly talking us to the table.   Server - Excellent. Inital greeting and throughout, impeccable. Thank you for your expertise.   Water/bus - Terrible. Awkward timing in clearing of plates, coming too soon and then poor water service.  Appetizer - tartare, good but only memorable insofar as the onions overpowered the dish  Porterhouse - perfectly seasoned/aged, cooked to temp  Lobster & tenderloin - miss - poached correctly (not tough) but flavorless and \"tough tenderloin\" though \"cooked to\" temp was correct.  Overall- my meal was lukewarm, scalloped potatoes were scorchingly hot, only porterhouse \"just right\"  Cocktails - Superb. Straightforward Grey Goose martini (garnish as requested) & Gentleman Jack, rocks.   Wine - Nice. Sample provided and adequate pour.   To go items - Wretched. Lasting impression\" / \"take-away\" marketing, if you will. We requested bone (still ample meat) only to find \"no bone.\"  Main breach: $200+ meal with heavy items such as scalloped potatoes & lobster mac requires better than flimsy boxes. Somehow too, leftovers literally adhered to outside sticker. Lose the cheap boxes! Absolutely unappetizing. If you're going to call \"green!\" (Re: packaging) then instruct staff not to find it unusual if a patron requests the leftover bread from initial basket \"to go.\"  Waste is waste.   It's not in my expectations that Cap Grille would be so inconsistent nor that my annoyance would persist each time I see the leftovers in the fridge. Second time that we're left dissatisfied so more than likely, the last."}
{"text":"An amazing dining experience!! I was most impressed by the extremely attentive, professional, friendly service. For special occasions or just a dining splurge, this place holds it's own and is well worth the indulgence! Our server, (Eric, I believe) was one of their trainers and very skilled at his craft! He made an excellent wine recommendation and made us feel SO welcome throughout our entire two and a half hour dinner!  I ordered my filet mignon medium rare, and it was truly medium rare, which I LOVE! Eric brought us a delicious red wine that was perfect for what I requested and very reasonably priced. We ended up going and buying the same wine at the liquor store and it was only $20 less!  The pièce de résistance was my Creme Brulee and coffee. I get this dessert quite often and know how it should turn out... The quality here was the BEST! Softly sweet, thick, creamy, and perfectly caramelized with ripe berries on top.  We took several items to go, which came out in bags tied with a thank-you note, hand-signed by the head chef! The attention to detail and level of passion for excellence displayed at this restaurant easily puts it at the very top for me. We WILL be back!"}
{"text":"Having been here a few times for dinner, Capital Grill is a go-to for food & service. I have enjoyed a variety of entrees here, as well as their bar for signature cocktails and appetizers. This past week a friend and I decided to stop in for a drink at the bar. While enjoying our cocktails, we decided to check out the bar menu. Richard was our server, and he was very attentive & made a few recommendations, one being the smoked salmon. We were sold. He set up a nice dinner display, even though you are sitting at the bar, you get napkin, plate, etc set -up. Our appetizer was delivered and was delicious. The dish comes with smoked salmon, cream cheese, onions, capers, and crostini. It was delicious! I look forward to my next visit, and appreciate that Capital Grille continues to stay true to serving the customer with great food & service!"}
{"text":"Long a bookmark for me, we finally ate here a couple of months ago with two of my very best friends who were visiting from out of town. I called to make reservations only a few hours before we arrived on a Saturday evening.  When asked if we would be there for a special occasion, I mentioned that we were celebrating our engagement.  Fast forward to our reservation time. The four of us were led to a table that was decorated with red heart confetti and had a greeting card congratulating us (see photo).  Wow, that's quite a welcome! Mike, our server, was fantastic and made us all feel special the entire meal. After starters of bread and Caesar salad, I had the Filet, Oscar-style, with a generous portion of lump crab and béarnaise sauce.  Everything was delicious.  This place is very busy, but we had attentive service throughout the meal.  The happy ending was the complimentary dessert of cheesecake and a chocolate cake:  thank you, CG!   If you want to celebrate a special occasion in style and taste, come here.  If you want to read the rhyme, see my fiancé's review for the same place, under Mel C.    Cheers, The Future Mrs. C."}
{"text":"Better than expected! I tend to shy away from chain steak restaurants and try the local places, but Capital Grille was surprisingly good. I tried the sliced filet and tomato and mozzarella salad, and both were very good. I would also highly recommend the gingerbread ice cream if they still have it!"}
{"text":"Ok, I am totally breaking some of my general Yelp rules here...but I have to, because this place was so good. I generally don't give 5 stars on a first visit and I also don't generally give 5 stars to a chain restaurant, but this place really blew me away. The BF and I went here last night for Restaurant Week. We had actually just gotten our reservation because we had a res somewhere else but then had to be out til after the other place closed....lucky I guess. So anyway, we get there and there is complimentary valet (which I generally find annoying, but was nice last night because we were running late). We came into the restaurant and immediately felt welcome, everyone was very friendly. We were seated right away and our waitress, Sarah, came by to explain the menu. She was super friendly and helpful and really on top of things, so that was nice.    Ok, the food: After being seated, they bring out an assortment of warm breads with softened butter. And I mean a real assortment: cracker type bread, a roll that looks like an everything bagel, delicious onion bread, and a wheat bread with raisins or some kind of fruit in it....each bread was delicious (take that Atkins!). The BF ordered a Manhattan ($11.50) and said it was 'damn good' and he is a regular Manhattan drinker, so I gotta believe it. So start, I had the french onion soup (on Sarah's recommendation) and the BF had the field greens. The soup was SO good. I generally am not a huge fan of french onion soup because it has a weird texture, but this one was full of flavor and had a ton of cheese on it. I literally was peeling cheese off the side of the bowl and eating it (I know, not so cool in a fancy restaurant...but it was so tasty!). The field green salad was light, with a flavorful, but subtle vinaigrette. It had several types of tomatoes on it, which the BF loved. For mains I had the filet mignon and the BF had the kona sirloin. They came with a little share plate of mashed potatoes and green beans. The sirloin was delicious...it had this amazing sauce on it (don't know what it was, but it has some great caramelized onions in it) and was cooked perfectly. The filet was equally good, it was simple, but cooked to perfection, it was melt in your mouth and had the perfect steak texture (no fat, gristle, anything weird feeling). I will say, the filet was even better with a little of the sauce from the sirloin, but I understand why the serve it the way they do (steak purists and all....). The mashed potatoes were divine. They were some of the most creamy, buttery mashed potatoes I have had. I wanted to lick the plate. The green beans were also delicious, very well seasoned and served with onions....yum! Now on to dessert- We shared the creme brulee and the chocolate espresso cake. Both were amazing.... When I had my first bite of the chocolate cake it was like the most intense chocolate explosion in my mouth. The espresso just adds to the intensity. I will say this, this is a dessert to be shared...it truly is too chocolatey (and large) for one person....and I love chocolate. The creme brulee was equally amazing, it was creamy with just a hint of crunch, but the most impressive part (to me anyway) was it had blackberries on it that had no seeds. What?!?! Where do I get these blackberries? They were phenomenal!   At the end of the meal, Sarah went outside and had the valet bring our car around before we even left so we didn't have to wait....ummm, seriously awesome service.   So, overall, the meal was excellent. I probably ate about 3000 calories....sorry thighs....but if I got to choose a place to destroy my diet, this would be it. The restaurant week deal was amazing too because my steak alone was 41$, but the whole meal was 30$ on special. Insanity. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"My hubby and I dined here for Restaurant Week and we were happy!  I indulged in the Wedge with the Filet and Mashed.  The Filet was a generous portion-and I would have loved a little more of the Mashed Spuds.  For dessert I almost ate every last bite of the Flourless Torte-It was decadent to the nth degree but I had a full belly from the 3 course meal.  We usually seek out steak at Flemings or Steak 44 so this was a departure.  It is a little more formal and quiet at CG but we were pleased with our service and meals."}
{"text":"Returned to C.G. with a couple of friends. The steaks and veal chop were tasty, grilled properly, though the veal chop was pretty small for the money.   The sides, brussel sprouts and au gratin potatoes, were a disappointment. We shared an order of each among three of us (men) and they didn't all get eaten. That tells you something.  The meat, ambiance, and service are very good but not worth the very high prices. It cost over $250 with tip and we had no beverages or dessert."}
{"text":"This place is awesome especially with the atmosphere.  Very upscale feel with an affordable menu.  The staff is very friendly and extremely helpful.   I typically get the steak and is cooked close to perfection.  Have had the salmon which is also phenomenonal.   For appetizers they have a steak tartare that is one of the best that I've had.    To top it off dessert is good and to the point.  Very easy menu and easy to find what you want.    Would recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"What to say about The Capital Grille?? Well for starters I LOVE THE CAPITAL GRILLE!!!!! This is my fourth time coming here and I am continually impressed by this place. I have been to quite a few steak houses ( Boa, Smith & Wollensky, etc.) and this place is by far the best!!!   The decor is wonderful with dark woods, brass fixtures, and huge Tiffany style chandeliers. There is about a 180 degree view of the city from the 3rd floor restaurant. There is a perfect level of jazz being played through out the restaurant. Just loud enough to be heard and drowned out some of the noise but not to loud that you hear it over your own conversation.   We were seated immediately in a very private booth with a nice view of the city. Shortly after our server appeared with a basket of warm, fresh breads and butter. The basket contained what seemed to be  sourdough, sesame and poppy seed rolls, a sweet brown bread, and a flat sesame type flat bread.   For our appetizer we had the Pan Fried Calamari with Hot Cherry Peppers.($13) This is the best calamari I have ever had.( and I have put away a few tons of calamari in my life!!) It comes out in a heaping pile which is then french served to us by our server. We squeeze a little lemon on it and that's all it needs. It is not served with a sauce which it did not need anyway. It is crispy and not chewy, sweet from the cherry peppers but also a little heat from them. Just the perfect amount of flavors that result in it not needing sauce or anything else just to be eaten and enjoyed.  The second course was a Spinach with Warm Bacon Dressing Salad.($9) They split it for the GF and I in the kitchen which was nice. It was a perfect sized salad with the right amount of fresh bacon, hard boiled egg, and red onion. The salad was excellent and it reminded me of the one my great grandma used to make me when I was a kid. Which no other spinach salad has done for me. Another great course.  For our entrees I had the 24 oz. Dry Aged Porterhouse. ($41) It was HUGE and TENDER!!! The New York Side was so good it reminded me of a filet. Then I tasted the filet side which I could only compare to something just melting in your mouth. It was cooked to a perfect Med Rare. It is not served with and sauce nor does it need it. It is just excellent meat served by itself for you to enjoy. The GF had the Kona Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin with Caramelized Shallot Butter. ($40) It was served on a plate topped with the caramelized shallot butter and two shallots. This was quite a large steak as well. The couple bites I had were amazing. You could taste the coffee but also the sweetness from the caramelized shallots. It was also insanely tender. WOW what a wonderful steak. For our sides we ordered The Parmesan Truffle Fries and the Lobster Mac-N-Cheese.  The fries were awesome great truffle flavor and crunchy but not to oily. The lobster mac was Great!! Excellent flavor and lots of large chunks of lobster. It was so rich we couldn't even finish it.   We finished off our meal with their signature coconut cream pie and the flour-less chocolate espresso cake. My GF loved the coconut cream pie. I love coconut cream pie but thought this one was good nothing too special. Now the flour-less chocolate cake on the other hand was the best thing ever. Little hints of espresso and raspberry sauce and a thick chocolaty fudge like consistency. AMAZING!!!   The ONLY bad thing was my GF only ate about 1/4 of her steak so we asked for it to go. You guessed it someone threw it away!!!!! I finally had a reason to give this place 4 stars. Then our server stepped up and said the kitchen was making a new one right now and cooking it to rare so we could finish it off at home and it would come out medium rare!!! WOW that's a save!! 5 stars welcome back.   All I have to say is please try this place. For the size and quality this place is a little cheaper than some of the others in town and I think it is the BEST. Service is always good and the food never disappoints."}
{"text":"fancy place with great service... but, i can make a better ribeye at home."}
{"text":"It's pricey, but it's good!  Their steaks oscar style are a great combination.  The crab is lumb and bountiful!  I have brought multiple work groups here, and accidentally ordered a large seafood tower appetizer.  The variety of crustaceans was amazing - the price was astronomical!  Thank god I was expensing it!    Restaurant week is also a great bang for your buck here - less than $40/person gets you a 3 course meal with one of the best steaks in town!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. My friends and I stopped in for one last meal in Scottsdale Arizona, after a week's vacation in Sedona. We are picky, Oregon foddies, and didn't expect to be impressed. But starting with Chris, a thoughtful and intelligent waiter, our experience was magical. Excellent wine, great food and kind service made our last meal in Arizona one of the best. A complimentary desert and champagne from our waiter,  just so we would have fond memories of Scottsdale, cinched the experience. We'll be back!  This is my first yelp review. I've never been moved by food or service to take the time to review."}
{"text":"Came in for Thanksgiving because we were orphans this year and it was my husband's birthday- he gets to eat what he wants!   Our bartender, Rachel, was amazing, and gave us all of our drinks timely and on point. We ordered a New York strip- bone in- rare plus. It came out medium. But they fixed it right away.   Highlight: I was able to order a side of stuffing and gravy from the thanksgiving menu with my steak!"}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here at least a couple of times a year and it's always outstanding.  I eat in a lot of steakhouses and this is one of the best.  They still dry age many of their steaks (not many places do that anymore) and they are always cooked perfectly.    We had supper here last night for our anniversary, which we have done for the last several years.  The waiter remembered us from the previous year including which table we sat at.  I decided to order the sea bass this time and it was perfect.  My wife had the sole which was also great.  The side dishes are equally well prepared.   It ain't cheap but it's a good value for what you get."}
{"text":"I ordered their porterhouse steak which was decent but not that good.  The steak had no char on the outside at all, and was a much thinner cut than I am accustomed to.  At $45 the steak should be better.  It is dry aged which is good and compared to the price and quality of other steakhouses I have been to in Vegas it is OK.   Their signature steak is the ribeye but I am not really a fan of ribeye steaks due to their fattiness. The sides were excellent along with the French onion soup. The chef prepared a special complementary appetizer of shrimp tempura which was excellent and appreciated.  The ambiance is nice, but bathroom is pretty dirty. This restaurant is owned and operated by mega restaurant corp Darden.  The wine list was extensive and farily priced.  Overall a pretty good value if you would like a formal, nice dinner in this town for a non absurd price."}
{"text":"One of the popular steakhouses downtown. If you're looking to have a special night out and splurging a little, this is the spot. Service quality is great but expect long wait times during the popular lunch and dinner hours.  Although I've heard great things, as a vegetarian diner, I was not overly impressed. They offer two off-menu vegetarian dishes: pasta with tofu/veggies or a rice dish with tofu/veggies. You get to select the vegetables and how your tofu is prepared. It was disappointingly bland and dry. The rice must've been sitting out for a while because it was crunchy by the time I got it. I had to ask for a sauce to drench over the tofu to add some flavor. It was like biting into styrofoam. The truffle fries saved the meal because they were delicious. Although they didn't have a house aioli, our server whipped up one last minute and it needed up tasting fantastic. We ended with ice cream for dessert that our server loaded up with berries, chocolate syrup and whipped cream - plus it was on the house for their Valentines' Day special. Everything tastes better if it's free."}
{"text":"You must have the French onion soup it's amazing. The service is awesome the staff is very attentive"}
{"text":"Every time I come here, it's better than the time before, and it's always a five star experience. Raul was our server tonight, he was excellent."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to CG with no reservation truly hoping to eat in the bar.    We could sit right away and proceeded to get the worst service we have ever encountered.  The bartenders were a man and woman and were actually bickering at each other the whole night in front of the customers.  They looked disheveled and acted completely overwhelmed.  We had to beg for service......and even tried to waive to get attention.  We had to ask several times for wine, bread and dessert.  They barely made eye contact and were cleaning glasses in the bar dishwasher.  I say the kitchen should do the dishes b/c the bartenders were spending their valuable time loading/unloading the dishes instead of waiting on customers.  Plus, the dishwasher was emanating the strongest chemical steam every time they opened the dishwasher...so a complete appetite buster.  The food came out under cooked.......I even ordered the onion soup and the cheese was not even melted on top so obvious to the kitchen, runner, waiter and bartender  but they still served it any way...thus cold soup.  My husband ordered the smoked salmon and it looked and smelled ripe.  Our steak entrees were wonderful....but it is a steak house....so pretty much expected that.  The restrooms are located past the kitchen where the waiters/waitresses are moving at rapid pace in and out of....so it truly is like running the gauntlet to get past them to go to the ladies room.  We go to Flemings, Maestros, Dominicks all the time and wanted to try something new to us............NEVER again."}
{"text":"Weird that they are closed. Yelp said open until 11. They offered nothing in return and weren't even aware that it said they were open for an extra hour. Good luck getting my 200 dollars in the future."}
{"text":"My honey took me to this restaurant for my birthday. First off the complimentary valet was a major plus because uptown can be a nightmare. We were greeted and seated promptly (we did have a reservation). The wait staff was very professional and attentive throughout dinner. We did order from the bar (there was a full bar) however I felt like we needed to order from their drink menu. The wait staff did not seem confident that my boyfriend could get the drink he wanted the way he wanted it.   I ordered the salmon, mushrooms, potatoes au gratin. My boyfriend had the roasted chicken. The food was good overall. The mushrooms could have used a little more seasoning but the potatoes were delicious!   Oh I forgot to mention that the table was decorated nicely with confetti and a card from the restaurant for my birthday. Very nice touch!   I did get a complimentary dessert for my birthday and the waiter even offered to take our pic!   I would go back for sure but special occasions only because it was definitely pricey but it is upscale so that's to be expected!!!"}
{"text":"Can you ever give a fancy steakhouse less than 5 stars!?!? Not in my experience!  Sat up at the bar and enjoyed a lovely steak dinner and sides with an amazing bottle of wine. Service was stellar and all the staff was amazing. Manager even came up and we had a wonderful conversation about wine and uses of different wine glasses.  Of course we got complimentary desserts for celebrating our birthday there.   Tip! You can get half order of the appetizers and side dishes!"}
{"text":"Luxury service here. You are treated right! Wine list and cocktails are spot on. Food is superb, of course. Great place for a business lunch or dinner. Sit at the bar and enjoy yourself!"}
{"text":"I had lunch at Capital Grill and was pleasantly surprised by the menu options that included fish and other non-meat items. The service was impeccable from the moment we stepped into the restaraunt. I was surprised that it wasn't more crowded but there was an ice storm brewing outside, which could have forced people to stay in. Even though I begrudgingly went to Cap Grill because my boyfriend wanted a steak, I enjoyed myself just as much as he did. I had the salmon salad, which our waiter recommended, and was delicious, and my boyfriend had the filet, which he has never been disappointed by at any Cap Gill. The service stands out at Cap Grill and, as long as you're in the mood for deliciously prepared but simple dishes, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Decent enough place.  Kinda outdated.  The food was ok.  The service was top-notch.  And the location was not bad.  It's right in front of the Wynn."}
{"text":"By far the best Birthday dinner I have ever had. My family and I often visit many other high end steak houses, so expectations were high.  Chris our server knocked it out of the park.  But let me start with the moment we walked in the hostesses were extremely pleasant and sat us right away.  Our table was de orated with a hand written note, confetti and golf tee's. So awesome! Start to finish CHRIS and his assistant were excellent.  Recommendations, answers to questions etc.    The food? 5 star! Bone in rib eye, sea bass, New York strip, shrimp cocktail, calamari(didn't even need sauce)   Can't wait to go back very soon!"}
{"text":"Sorry- just doesn't do it for me.  The steak is average and it's over run by BoA middle management."}
{"text":"As a refugee from Hurricane Irma I am highly sensitive to any \"dis\" or slight of any kind at this moment in time. I almost got locked up after an incident at the Carnegie Museum of Art when an overzealous guard tried to confiscate my elderly mother's backpack (purse). It was a Pyrrhic victory as I was still shaking with rage when I arrived here for dinner... But the SS Irma couldn't have docked at a friendlier port!!! I am a huge fan of the Capital Grille in Boca so this was like coming home! It felt like a parallel universe as this place was also loaded with snooty oil paintings, dead animals and gorgeous chandaliers (just like the one I love at home). Absent were the obsequious servers I have known for years and instead I was treated to a more urbane dining experience! My waitress was very friendly but I wasn't treated like a nineteenth century Victorian, in colonial India, like I usually am at the one in Boca... It was actually quite refreshing!!! A member of our group was suffering from the effects of exotic room service (which we've been subsisting on at the Fairmont) and we had to leave early but this hardly fazed our hosts! They wrapped up our delicious food (some of which was way off menu) and sent us happily on our way... Anyone who turns their nose up at this fine city and its excellent restaurants is a fool!! This Capital Grille is just as good as the one in Boca and I highly recommend it to any and all!"}
{"text":"Went here for my boyfriends birthday amazing food amazing service they way they make their calamari is sooooo good it's the best one We've ever tried lobster Mac and cheese was also really good we will be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic server named Jeff. Blue point oysters ...on point!! ;-)  huge serving of calamari.  Great surf n turf"}
{"text":"The best place to celebrate a birthday!  Greeted with a hand written card and ended with a beautiful birthday desert.  This restaurant never fails to impress.  The food is wonderful and the service is impeccable.  I will always recommend the tuna steak (one of my favorites) but their beef steaks are delicious as well. The lobster mac and cheese as well as all of their sides dishes is awesome.  If you are looking for great food and service this is a special place to go."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite fine dining establishments. Love this location as well as Scottsdale and Denver.  Have had two small and large celebrations at this location.  Always the best food and cocktails every time.  Great staff professional and knowledgeable about menu and pairings. Their beef selections are wonderful and cooked to perfection.  Save room for the flour less chocolate cake. Definitely worth coming to."}
{"text":"Came here for my company Christmas party, and we all had a good time.   1. The private room was a good setting to break away from the large crowds (ACC championship was going on).  2. The customer service was good. The waiters were on point with drinks and refills, as well as knowledge of the menu.  3. The food was solid. Everyone enjoyed the steaks as they were seasoned and cooked perfectly! The lobster Mac and cheese is the best I have ever had! Large chunks of lobster and the perfect amount of cheese. The calamari and crab cakes were also very solid. My wife had scallops and they were also amazing!   4. The reason this review gets 4 stars instead of 5 is that I planned this for months, and I had pre order apps to pass around during our cocktail hour, and they never came. They also stated they were not informed, even though there is email records. Either way, they apologized and we still had a good time, but it was still disappointing, especially when we dropped 8k on the experience.  5. Besides the mishap we had a great time. The food was great as were the drinks, so there is definitely no complaints there. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Perfect to take clients during the Sema show Las Vegas. Always a winner. Nice bar, good cocktails. Valet parking on the back with private elevator. MUST make reservation. Amazing wine selection"}
{"text":"I've been dying to come here to get my steak on, but the menu prices are downright daunting! This time around we made reservations to partake in their Restaurant Week menu, and it is the most affordable way to experience one of the better restaurants in the area.  The Capital Grill may be a chain, but it definitely doesn't feel like it. From the interior decor to the service to the actual food, everything screams upscale fancy-smancy...not something that is usually associated with a chain. We made reservations (highly recommended) and were seated almost immediately.  Our server was very friendly and brutally honest. I guess she was forced to try to upsell us a $17 glass of wine but then told us how ridiculous it is and we shouldn't bother with it. When we did choose a bottle of wine she detoured us to a different bottle that was the same price but was more well-received. I'm glad we went with her recommendation because it ended up being an awesome bottle that we would have overlooked otherwise.   For the first course of the Restaurant Week menu I had the New England Clam Chowder. I am a sucker for clam chowda and this stuff was great. It wasn't overly heavy with cream and had a ridiculous amount of succulent clam chunks in it. This chowda definitely didn't skimp on the seafood, and the clams, potatoes and bacon were all melded nicely for some of the best I've had in awhile. The missus got the field green salad which was very nice, and came with an excellent champagne dressing that worked very well with the veggies. I was almost a little jealous of her salad, but I had chowder in front of me, so that feeling didn't last long.  The Restaurant Week menu was decent for entrees, with a few steak options as well as a chicken and salmon. I ordered the 14oz bone-in sirloin and this was one of the most magnificent steaks I've had in the Queen City. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare just as I ordered it, and it was a tender, juicy, tasty steak with an excellent beef flavor. It was such a huge steak that I only ate half and saved the rest for a leftover dinner the next night!   The missus had the Citrus Glazed Seared Salmon. It was a very nice piece of salmon that wasn't overpowering, and the glaze was really tasty. Her plate also came with some roasted asparagus that were cooked perfectly and had a nice sauce drizzled on top. Our table was also served shared side dishes of mashed potatoes and green beans. The potatoes were crazy rich, creamy and delicious, and there were still a few nice lumps mixed within the majority of the velvety mass, making these potatoes freaking awesome. The green beans were also tasty, and were tossed with tomatoes to give it a little extra pop.  For dessert we both shared the Cheesecake and Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake. The cheesecake was actually more like a mousse, and so it was light as opposed to dense. It tasted wonderful and the top is caramelized to give it a crisp bite. It was served alongside a few berries and strawberry glaze, which made one delicious mouthful. The chocolate cake was just as good, if not slightly better. The espresso flavor is very light so if you're not a coffee fan don't be afraid to give this a whirl. The consistency of the cake was more like a chewy fudge, making it extremely decadent.   The Capital Grill is the place to go, so long as you have to cash. The food is all excellent and I would love to go back and try some other stuff out. The ambiance, service and food all scream swank, and it definitely feels like it warrants the extravagant price tag."}
{"text":"I felt very fancy schmany being in here for lunch.  You definitely receive the the same fancy schmancy service you'd expect too.  I was just very impressed with the whole experience from beginning to end.  Trying to stay on the healthy side, I was a little nervous about going to a steak house.  Don't get me wrong, I love me some filet mignon.  And maybe another time, some filet will be had... But for now I had to stay on the safe side.    The soup of the day was lobster bisque.  Darnnit! I love lobster bisque!  That was a hard one to avoid.  So... I ordered that and kept the rest of the meal light.  The lobster bisque was awesome!  A tomato base with a HUGE piece of lobster in the bottom.  NICE surprise!  For the main course I ordered the scallops in lemon sauce instead of butter and sauteed greens.  It was a fantastic choice because it tasted yummy and was on the healthy side.  The scallops were a great size, seared and cooked perfectly, with a light lemon sauce.  The greens were also served in the lemon sauce, which made them equally as delicious and flavorful.    I had one tiny tiny bite of their creme brulee cheese cake and it was to. Die. For!  Seriously, if you're going for dessert, any choice is probably going to be a good one considering the choices I heard that day!    I must say again, the service was stellar.  From start to finish everything was taken care of.  The servers were extremely friendly too, and seriously seemed like they enjoyed their job and the food there.    So if you're looking for a fancy schmancy night out with stellar service and food, this is your place!"}
{"text":"I feel compelled to say that I agree with Vinh about Mindy W. There are too many people who write these food reviews trying to sound like they're a foodie, or at least knowledgeable about food, and then it turns out they only go out like four times a year!  I like Capital Grille. I like it as much as Morton's. I like both better than Smith and Wollensky, Butcher and Singer, Ruth's Chris, Sullivan's, and The Palm. I get my steaks medium rare. On rare occasion, such as when I order prime rib at S&W, I get it rare. This is the ONLY way to eat quality meat. USDA Prime meat (and Choice) is not going to kill you like the crap you get in supermarkets. Supermarket meat needs to be cooked well done because the supermarket butcher probably rarely washes his hands.  I've tried the sliced filet mignon, the filet \"cooked to order\", the lobster bisque, and the crab cocktail at Capital. The lobster bisque needed more lobster, but the bisque was quite good and not too strong. My filet entrees were awesome. It's amazing that they can make Choice cuts taste like Prime."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Capital Grille! Food and service deserves 10+ stars. This is one of my family's favorite and they never cease to disappoint, both in the east and west coast! Pure perfection!"}
{"text":"Consistently great.  Every time we go, the food and the service exceed our expectations.   And as good as the food is, it's even more about the fantastic people who serve the fantastic food.   Calling it \"service\" almost demeans the high level of professionalism and friendliness that are the hallmarks of the CG team.  The serving professionals at CG are like old friends that you want to just invite to sit down and chat, and yet their speed and professionalism are unmatched.  Lots of great examples to share, but I'll refrain, other than to say both Michelle and Alex are phenomenal.    The menu is not inspired, but that's very much OK - it is consistently A+ quality.   You know what you're going to get, every time.   CG is a go-to place; as good as it gets."}
{"text":"My rating is based on the steak, which is their specialty, and was done perfectly. Everything else is good too, but probably just 4 stars. Thank goodness this visit was much better than our last two when we had some issue.  They seem to have been in their groove on Saturday.  It's pretty pricey but great value during Restaurant Week. Wines are way overpriced so it's better to BYOB and pay the $25 corkage. Our waiter, Ryan, was excellent"}
{"text":"The Capital Grill is the best steak experiences in Charlotte. Great ambience. The bone in filet mignon was outstanding."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Service was great, especially the bartenders. My friend had the swordfish, took one bite, and did not try another one. Was surprised that the server did not notice this, but he didn't complain when she asked how we were all doing. I ordered the special of the night, which was a 10oz ribeye. Server came back to say they were all out of the specials, so there were two other ribeye choices on the menu. I didn't have the menu to look at anymore, so she recommended I order the ribeye that my husband wasn't already getting. It ended up to be a 22oz kona rubbed. I had no idea they would use coffee grounds; I just kept wondering why the surface had the consistency of dirt. I figured it out once I looked it up later. Frankly, I'd rather have a steak from Chili's. My husband was not too happy with his ribeye. I think it had a porcini sauce that he thought was too sweet. Our other friend had a filet, and she had no complaints. We also ordered the lobster Mac n cheese, which we order pretty much anywhere we go that has it; it was just meh. I had the spinach salad, which was also just ok. I have had better at Applebee's. We also had the truffle fries, but they were not very crispy or impressive. Yikes! I feel bad even saying these things, but it's true.   Although we were not impressed at all by the food, we still had a good time. The location is great, and our view was amazing. Service was also good, which is why I still give it two stars."}
{"text":"Good steak because it is prime meat but not to a par....beautiful place.  Good service but not great service....."}
{"text":"Impeccable wine list and service staff. Attention to detail and a bone-in Ribeye you'll talk about for days."}
{"text":"Excellent mid day stop to unwind from the day. The wine selection is superb and Joe adds a personal touch to ensure the proper choice in wine selection to enhance the experience!"}
{"text":"The Capital Grille is possibly my new Favorite restaurant in all of Cleveland!  The food was just outstanding!  I loved the variety of menu options, the great wine list, but more importantly the service was made dining here a really special experience (Thanks Rich H.).   If we are celebrating something, having dinner with friends or just a fun date night...this is going to be our \"go to\" restaurant!  Loved it!"}
{"text":"My wife and daughters decided to treat me to a special Father's Day dinner at the Capital Grille today.  We arrived on time for our reservation and were seated in a comfortable spot.  I loved the ambience.  Very old school refined steak house and I was excited for our meal.    My wife ordered the salmon and I asked for the Kona rubbed strip, medium.  The food comes out and when I cut in to my steak it is well done.  The managing partner, Armin, happens to be right there and I signal him to make him aware of what is going on.  He immediately takes it back and has the chef start a new steak for me.  As I'm waiting, I try my wife's salmon and it is absolutely delicious.   Armin asks if I would like some lobster bisque as I wait and I decline as I had already had the delicious sweet corn soup.    The new steak comes out and...it's rare and chewy to the point that I can't eat it.  I tell my waiter and say I've lost my appetite.  Clearly the staff is not happy and it's clear they are taking this personally.  Armin personally brings out a tray with three delicious desserts, comps our entire meal and hands me his business card saying he wants me back and to call him before I do so he can personally oversee to my experience.   Every restaurant has a bad night, it's how they resolve the situation that truly matters to me. They staff was tremendously gracious and I am excited to go back as I know they'll knock my socks off next time. Good job, gentlemen."}
{"text":"When we first arrived at CG, we were greeted with the best hospitility an restaurant can give, everyone was friendly.  Which I would give 5 star for that, however the food which I ordered the $20.00 jumbo entree and it was truly over cooked, the water not the best if your use to drinking filter water, so I order lemonade and that wasn't the best."}
{"text":"I blew it. My 1st visit to the Cap, and I didn't order my usual high-end steakhouse staple, a filet.  I realize some steaks are unlike filets, where they are part good meat, and part fat and gristle, but I think I actually got one Capital Grille wouldn't have been proud they served.  Too bad we were in a bit of hurry and I didn't send it back.  The leftover bit I took home was almost all sub-standard.  The service was excellent, as was the rest of the meal, but when the main course is a dud, you can't help but leave disappointed.  It was my 1st visit to the highly-regarded restaurant, and I expected a 5-star experience."}
{"text":"We had our company holiday party and it was a great experience!  We were seated in a nice and spacious private room that was beautifully decorated for the holidays.  The menu came with a salad, an entree, shared sides, and dessert platter.  The salad was really really good.  It was simple and light.  I enjoyed the dressing and the addition of the white carrots.    For my entree I got filet mignon.  The medium rare here is slightly too rare for me, and my server offered the option of something between medium and medium rare, which ended up being perfect!  The vegetable and mashed potatoes sides were excellent.  The dessert platter came with a cheesecake, berries and cream, and an espresso chocolate cake.  The berries were so sweet and I loved the chocolate although it was suuuuuper duper rich."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best steakhouse I have ever been too... complements to the chef on the steak but the real show stopper was Jeff the waiter.  Dude was spot on from the moment we sat down, highly recommend this place and will be back on future trips."}
{"text":"Love appetizers and drinks at the Capital bar!  The calamari with peppers is excellent, and you can't beat their signature pineapple infused vodka (Stoli Doli) martini! The staff is friendly and attentive. If you like a steakhouse with a warm wood ambiance and outstanding food, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here for years and the food is always very consistent and excellent. I really enjoy their lobster bisque. I have never had a bad meal or experience here."}
{"text":"What you would expect from Capital Grille. A chain restaurant of good steaks burgers and seafood. Good overall experience with an attentive staff. Only problem I have with these restaurants is everything is ala carte. For the prices and your meal should come with at least a side."}
{"text":"Food, wine, cocktail, service, ... everything is perfect. One of my favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"We usually love the capital grille! Came here for easter brunch. Eric our waiter was wonderful, my complaint is with management. If you're spending $150 on brunch on easter you want it to be perfect. I ordered the salmon and citrus crab salad my order came out and the \"crab salad\" was grapefruit with French Fries??? I mentioned it to our waiter as there was no crab but random French fries in my salad which neither of us ordered?? The waiter stated he mentioned it to the manager, while the manager came over twice to the table next to use to speak with her \"regulars\" not ONCE did she apologize or even introduce herself to us! For the capital grille this is Unacceptable! Will not be returning, I expect more if I wanted this treatment I might as well go to the local Chili's? Don't waste your time or money, Dominick's and maestros have MUCH better service and quality!"}
{"text":"When family said they like the Capitol Grille and wanted to dine here after visiting the Costa Mesa location, I was hesitant. I assumed it was a typical steakhouse- little to no veggie options. Boy was I surprised! Our waiter was nice when I asked about vegetarian/vegan options and they are happy to accommodate. The options vary by location. I had a plate of mixed veggies- grilled. It was actually a huge plate with about 5 different veggies(corn, bell peppers, mushrooms, bell peppers, broccoli). It was amazing. I want to say they have sorbet on the menu too, but I didn't have any. Service was great. Food was surprisingly good. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"A friend of a relative recommended this place to us because we love calamari.  Three out of four of us ordered the calamari appetizer as presented on the menu.  I ordered the crab cocktail.  I wish I would have taken pictures, but I didn't.    First of all, my crab cocktail was delicious. It was presented beautifully.  The crab was by itself with an interesting cocktail sauce presented on the side. I don't remember what the ingredients were but it was a bit mustard like and I ate every bite.    The calamari came on a large plate (enough for two easily). It was very lightly battered and fried to perfection.  Light and crispy and slightly salty. However, as standard order, it came with an extremely spicy sauce laden with cherry and other peppers.  This was ladled over the top center of the entire plate.  (No avoiding it unless you didn't eat half of the calamari).  No one completed their plates.  The cocktail sauce that came on the side was completely different from the sauce that came with my crab.  It tasted like modified ketchup.   In the future, we will know to order the  calamari WITHOUT the extra pepper sauce.   I would order the calamari every time if I ordered it without the extra pepper sauce.  I suggest that they put the peppers on the menu as an option instead of the normal order to their calamari appetizer as the calamari itself was perfect.  The restaurant is very upscale feeling.  We came as we were and didn't feel under dressed at all.   The staff was very friendly and accommodating. I can't wait to try out the rest of the menu on our next visit to Arizona."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the soup here. If it is not so expensive, I would have more, lol"}
{"text":"I have been to two capital grille restaurants. The one in king of Prussia is the best service I have ever gotten from any restaurant anywhere! And not just once! Every time I go the food and service is beyond compare. Lobster Mac n cheese is amazing!  The one in Pittsburgh has decent food and the service is okay but it isn't anything to write home about. I would rather go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is a good steakhouse.  It's mostly what you would expect if you've been to this type of place in other cities.  I do like that they tailor the art to reflect the local history.  The bartenders are excellent.  I especially like Seth.  Unlike Mortons and Ruth Chris the bar is a lot of fun.  The crowd is similiar to the other steak places, but seem to me to be a bit younger.  The steaks are what you'd expect and they are excellent.  However, and this may just be my personal opinion I'd stay away from some of the exotic preparations (like coffee beans) and just stick with a good piece of meat.  I really liked the spinach.  They put just the right amount of nutmeg to give it an interesting taste.  The other sides are about average.  If I had to rank these steak places I mentioned in this review I'd have to say the Capital Grille is the current favorite.  I'd like to find a local place that is on par with these franchises, since I'd much prefer to support local business owners."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly, but we needed to flag our server down for drink refills, butter, and cracked pepper for our salad (things that are usually automatic at a restaurant of this caliber). The grilled prosciutto and mozzarella was delicious, the Caesar salad was tasty but slightly over dressed, and the potatoes au gratin were amazing. The most disappointing item that we ordered was the porterhouse steak. The taste was good, but it was dry and way over cooked (brown through despite ordering medium temperature). I was so disappointed because we had heard great things about Capital Grille and I had been craving a juicy quality steak for weeks. It definitely wasn't worth the price and we will be trying someplace new next time we're in town."}
{"text":"An amazing place has great food excellent wait staff very knowledgeable and friendly. I've been there twice once for my sisters birthday and the second time I took my parents for their anniversary absolutely amazing place would always recommend it it is pricey but if you can afford it you should definitely go the food is amazing service was amazing everything is amazing!"}
{"text":"Another fabulous Yelp Elite event!  The staff at The Capital Grille is first class!  They are attentive, knowledgeable and extremely personable!  The food was delicious!  Lobster rolls, steak sliders, lobster and crab sliders, calamari, truffle fries, red pepper bisque and mini coconut custards!   The steak sliders were my favorite!  The steak was cooked to the perfect temperature!  All of it was amazing!  Plus, wine and two specialty drinks, which were both delish as well!  On top of all of that, the gift bags provided by The Capital Grille were very generous and thoughtful!  Thank you, Lindsey, Yelp and The Capital Grille!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the location of this place...but WHY must we get stuck in this small room? The BF spent almost $400...  The steak tartare was okay....meh, actually. No sauce and the eggs were cooked! NOOOO. It needs to be a raw quail egg.  We had the surf and turf...I substitute my filet for a NY strip... it was a $100. The bone-in filet though..SOOOOO delicious!!!  $35 for a glass of Belle Gloss? Are you joking me? And it wasn't even a 6 oz pour..that's the worst!!  Our waiter was Alex.. I would've asked for a different table, but I felt bad for him..lol  The apple cobbler was okay...salted caramel gelato was good...Anyways, can't wait for Peter Luger's in NYC!"}
{"text":"My Absolute Favorite Calamari!\"  The Calamari, and great Bar Service are what keeps me coming back to The Capital Grille year after year.  I have enjoyed dinners here as well, but the Pan-Fried Calamari with Hot Cherry Peppers is what I crave, along with the house made potato chips which are a crispy golden brown. Of course, I don't turn down the Stoli Doli, a martini of chilled Stolichnaya vodka infused with fresh pineapple served straight up. Not to have one would just seem wrong somehow.   I think I feel another Capital Grille jones coming on..."}
{"text":"Went with friends on Saturday and usually service is great whenever we have been there but it was extremely busy due to the Phoenix Open being near-by and I think we had a new waiter working the outdoor cigar smoking patio. After a long time waiting for our Stoli-Doli's, which are awesome Martini's, our waiter returned with out them not realizing we had ordered them and then he was gone quite a while again to take our orders. By then we had gone through an entire basket of delicious bread. My husband and I shared the tomato mozzarella salad which was very good and different than your usual caprese salad, great 15 year old balsamic dressing. My husband had the dry-aged NY strip, medium rare and cooked perfectly. One of our friends had the Wagu Beef burger which he totally enjoyed and our other friend had shrimp cocktail that had several huge jumbo shrimp and she also had the lobster mac-n-cheese which she said was amazing. I ordered the beef tenderloin with lobster which I was sorry I ordered, the beef tenderloin was 2 very small pieces of filet cooked a perfect medium rare and 2 very large shrimp sized lobster tails that were a little dry and tough. I also wasn't expecting it to be on top of a white sauce. It was tasty but I would have enjoyed it better with just a clarified butter on the side. My husband and I shared a side of the brussel sprouts which are absolutely delicious and for me was the best part of the meal. We ordered creme brulee which was good, topped with a little fresh fruit and was light."}
{"text":"Very nice dinner especially for the price with the AZ Restaurant Week menu.  Everyone enjoyed their meal but once again the temperature on one of the steaks was quite right. My bone-in NY Strip was more medium than medium rare where I would have liked it."}
{"text":"One of the best lunches I've ever had was eaten at The Capital Grill. Sure, it might have been because it was free and I was able to order anything I wanted. Plus, we got complimentary apps and the dessert of our choice, but even then, the food was excellent. Trust me, \"excellent\" is not a word I throw around very often.   It was a business lunch, but I couldn't help but admire the wine list and imagine coming back here for dinner sometime. It would make a really great date place, especially if you splurged on the valet out front. After all, it is the Biltmore. And, let's face it, even I like getting dolled up every once in a while.   Back to lunch. I sampled the jumbo shrimp in the shrimp sauce, along with some really perfectly breaded calamari, which was the best calamari my lips have ever come across. I ordered the crab/lobster burger, which was presented as a seafood mix between a whole grain bun. Every bite was better than the last. I delightfully ate the entire thing.   Then, it was time for dessert. I chose the flour-less espresso cake. Unbelievable. It was so thick and rich, though, that I left half behind. Then again, who really needs to eat the entire piece? Granted, it was packed with so much sugar, I immediately began to droop into a mid-afternoon coma. But, I didn't care. I just had one of the best lunches of my entire life.   Sometimes I remember that lunch and I shake my head. Never mind it was for business. Never mind I didn't have any wine. Never mind I had to go back to work after wards. I still rate that lunch and this restaurant at 5 stars. Imagine how wonderful this could be if you order a glass of wine and go for a special occasion with a special someone. Wow. Talk about needing more stars for that!"}
{"text":"Good wine selection. Exceptional beef. Bar service good. Bar typically crowded. They serve incredible bread while you wait for your meal."}
{"text":"Most high end steak houses are heavy on pretension.  The capital grille was incredibly friendly, and has some nice \"small town touches\" like a massive oil painting of our own Mr. Rogers hanging on the wall.  The lighting, booths and tables are luxurious but cozy, and they manage to be both warm and elegant.  Their wine selection seems to go on forever, they looked to have well over 1000 bottles in their temperature controlled wine cellar, on hand ready for you to drink!  The staff was friendly and genuinely passionate about the quality of their food and drink.  The food was excellent and can be compared to Mortons or Ruths Chris, but Capital Grille beat them out with the warmest, most inviting atmosphere of any of the luxury steak houses I've had the pleasure of eating at."}
{"text":"This meal began well with an excellent meaty Shrimp Cocktail with zesty Cocktail Sauce.  And we were graciously accommodated with well-cooked Calamari Fritti prepared without Cherry Peppers (since Diane likes nothing spicy at all), and supplied with delectable specially requested Lemon Aioli in addition to Marinara Sauce.  The complimentary Bread Basket was also enjoyable, with lavosh liberally included in it.  After first being startled with a cup of French Onion Soup instead of the large crock I ordered, the understandable mistake (since I ordered so much food) was quickly remedied by our server, and to Diane's delight I ultimately received a vessel of cheesy soup overflowing with rivulets of Havarti Cheese.  The broth was bitter on top but sweet on the bottom.  Although she hates onions, Diane loves to peel off and eat cheese that runs down and congeals on the sides of ceramic containers holding French Onion Soup.  A Wedge Salad slathered with Bleu Cheese Dressing and peppered with fresh tomatoes seemed almost endless, and took over five minutes for me to fully consume.    While the Filet Mignon was well seasoned and prepared medium rare as ordered, its pairing with Butter Poached Lobster was a distinct disappointment, because the lobster was very tough and not at all sweet.  Grilled Asparagus was well cooked but quickly became cold, while sauteed Wild Mushrooms were a welcome accompaniment, and excellent Bearnaise Sauce was complemented by a just as tasty Red Wine Reduction.  A large Baked Potato with chives and chunks of pork belly was nicely seasoned and perfectly cooked, but I would have greatly preferred real bacon pieces instead of the squishy pork belly.   I almost resisted dessert but ultimately failed in my resolve, and compromised on Seasonal Mixed Berries with Vanilla Bean Creme Anglaise.  The mixed berries were fresh but not that sweet.  Overall, service was good, but Diane had to continually ask for water refills.  Usually the culinary experience here has been topnotch from beginning to end.  But this time the tough, tasteless lobster ruined the outing for me--especially for the high Strip prices of over $100 per person (even without alcohol) charged.  So, this time XXX-1/2 stars overall."}
{"text":"Classy joint with portraits of old men on the walls.  ATMOSPHERE: Clean & classy, resembling a vintage smoker's lounge where deals are made. Enjoyed the finely painted portraits of people of influence from the 1800s. Fine statues of deers and animals got my appetite started.  SERVICE:  I was dressed very poorly and still received the same  business class service as the rest of the finely suited gentlemen. Attentive, friendly, will scrape bread crumbs and keep your fluids topped off at all times.  FOOD: Delicious. Quality assurance department is doing their job.  MENU & PRICING: High end aged steak and fresh quality seafood. Expense it on your company card or stock up on top ramen next week."}
{"text":"This is a classic steak house.  Good service and great food. Go ahead- spend the extra money.  It's worth it."}
{"text":"Obsessed with everything about The Capital Grille!  I typically don't prefer to go to chain restaurants, but it is definitely one of the best steakhouses I've ever been to!  My family and I made dinner reservations at The Capital Grille for New Years Eve.  It turned out to be the perfect place for such an occasion!  The food was out of this world, the ambiance was relaxing and wonderful, and the service was flawless!  The restaurant is located on an upper floor of the Fashion Show mall on the Vegas Strip.  The inside of The Capital Grille is decorated very nicely.  The restaurant has windows from the floor to the ceiling, which offer a great view of the Strip!  Our reservations were for 5:30 p.m.  It was nice because we got to watch the Vegas strip fade from daytime to all lit up and sparkling at night.  The food- oh my goodness.  Everything was divine.  My table started with the fried calamari.  The calamari was served without any dipping sauces.  We were confused at first, but quickly realized why.  The golden calamari was served covered in a hot cherry pepper sauce.  It was amazing!  As my entree, I ordered the Seared Tenderloin with Butter Poached Lobster Tails (Their version of Surf n Turf).  The meal was perfection.  I had my meal with a side of the Lobster Mac n Cheese- one of the best I've ever had- and I pretty much order Lobster Mac n Cheese whenever I see it on a menu!  It was so crispy and flavorful.  My mom ordered the Fresh Maine Lobster.  My sister ordered the chef's suggestion- Bone In Ribeye in a 15-Year Aged Balsamic.  I tried both and they were equally delicious!  We somehow saved room for dessert.  Actually, we did not.  The meal to that point had just been so great that we knew we had to try the last course they had to offer.  Once we heard that the desserts were made in house, we were sold.  We split the Capital Grille Cheesecake with mixed berries.  The cheesecake was made brulee-style, with the crispy sugary top.  It was literally the best piece of cheesecake I've ever had.  As if the food wasn't enough of a selling point, the service was so great.  Our server's name was Juan.  Juan was extremely attentive and friendly.  He provided professional service, but maintained a down to earth disposition.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good steak or seafood dinner in Vegas.  It is pricier than average, but so worth it!"}
{"text":"As Las Vegas locals we visit this Capital Grille location a couple of times a year. We ate there last night for our anniversary and once again they did not disappoint. Starting with the reservationist, Mallory, the friendly greeting from the maître d' and the great Strip view from our table it was an outstanding experience. The service we received from our server Alex was exceptional. He asked about our time schedule and made sure we were on time for our show at The Wynn. We both decided on steak which is not always the case. I had the Delmonico while my wife had the sliced filet prepared with mushrooms and onions; both were delicious. The wedge salad was really nice as their blue cheese dressing is not overpowering. We tried the twice baked potato for the first time and enjoyed it.  It's tough to beat the combination of view, service and food that this Capital Grille provides. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Oh Capital Grille, how I am in love with you!!  We parked in the underground parking and took the elevator right up to TCG.  Upon entering you notice all of the wine lockers; lockers with peoples names on them to store wine for them...I want one!  The hostess was friendly and happy to seat us without reservations, even put us at a window seat.  The view of the Strip and the Wynn is delightful and so pretty at night.  Our servers were attentive and their suggestions were perfection.  We enjoyed the Generous Pour (1/2 of July and all of August) at only $28 (I think) a person.  I didn't even know I liked white wine until I paired it with my calamari.  The hubby and I shared a salad and a bone in filet (rubbed in Kona coffee) and a few side dishes.  There side dishes are fantastic here especially the lobster mac-n-cheese!  I also very much enjoyed the pineapple infused rum.  This place is now in my top 5 and I will be back frequently."}
{"text":"One and one dish only, lobster mac and cheese! And this is coming from an ex-Mainer lobster snob. If I ever come back again, I won't order anything else. Tried this branch twice, and the ribeye steaks were not as you would expect from a chain like Capital Grille. You can't come here and have low expectations for your steak. A good ribeye steak should be flavorful, well-seasoned and so tender that you can cut it with a butter knife (they say). I had more tender and tastier steaks.   The atmosphere is classic but it's so dark inside. It's darker than other Capital Grille locations I have been to. You can barely see the person in front of you.  Therefore, it's definitely not recommended for blind dates. On the other side, if you're a lady, no need for makeup when you come here, because it's too dark, no one will notice anything. Many companies bring people here to promote their business and get some people drunk after steaks..   In summary, I would come back only for that incredibly delicious perfectly baked lobster mac and cheese. I don't know how they cook it, but it's just perfect. For steaks, no, gracias."}
{"text":"We have been to The Capital Grill in New York before. This was the first time in Las Vegas. We were very impressed.  We arrived much too early. Although the place was packed, they managed everything to seat us after only a short wait.  The waiter was very efficient and fast. The food was exceptional. Everybody was very happy with their choices. I have to admit that the bone in Ribeye was somewhat not as tender as I expected, but this was balanced out by the wonderful taste.  We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"One of the top steakhouses in Las Vegas. We have eaten here every time we visit Vegas.  The atmosphere and service are first rate.  The staff couldn't be friendlier and efficient.  Great cocktails and a tremendous wine selection.  And the food...Oh the food!!  Appetizers are varied with a crab meat cocktail that surprised, all lump crab meat with a delicious dipping sauce.  The porcini rubbed bone-in rib eye with 15 year aged balsamic is the absolute bomb!! Possibly the best steak that I have had, and I have had many! The sides are shared as is customary in most steakhouses and are fresh and flavorful.  Make sure that you order the lobster mac and cheese...outstanding!!  Desserts...well I don't know since I never make it past the fabulous food. I highly recommend this place for a truly 5 star dining experience. For an extra special dining experience be sure to ask to be seated with Frankie!! The entertainment value adds to your evening's enjoyment..."}
{"text":"Capital Grille is definitely going to put a large hurting on your wallet but I will say that it ranks the best in that class of high dollar restaurant that I have had in a long time! It was awesome food to say the least.   I ordered the Caprese Salad for the starter, the Porcini Rubbed Delmonico with 12-year Aged Balsamic, and the creme brulle for dessert.   The salad was simple but amazing. You could definitely tell the mozzarella was made in-house and the balsamic gave it a good punch.   The steak was out of this world and if it was humanly possible to eat the bone also, it probably would have happened! I had it cooked medium-rare to perfection. Side note: when eating at a \"real\" steakhouse make sure to ask what their temperatures mean. Many places I go, I order it rare but at higher end places, they are going to cook it the way they say...and rare means cold red center.   For desert the creme brulle was great and had some fresh berries on top.  It is hard in my opinion to mess this dish up but they delivered very well!  Overall, a great dinner - I almost had to roll myself out of there.  Would I eat here on a typical night out for dinner?  No.  The price is prohibitive.  But for a nice business dinner and/or personal event.  It is top notch.  I wouldn't even consider going to Ruth Chris in comparison!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The wife and I usually stop in to Capital Grille on special occasions. Every time we go the service is great and the food is wonderful. Some of our personal favorites are the Bone-in kona crusted dry aged NY strip w/shallot butter (you can also ask for a ribeye instead of the NY strip if you want to bump it up a notch), filet oscar, lobster mac n cheese, and the lobster bisque is divine. They also have a great wine selection. We have never had a bad meal here yet."}
{"text":"The Capital Grille is by far one of the best dining experiences I've ever had.  I have been here twice for large group luncheons and the food and the service has been impeccable both times.  The staff are attentive and gracious without being ingratiating.  I've actually not been to any other steakhouses in Pittsburgh (Ruth Chris, Mortons, Eddie Merlots) so I have nothing to compare Capital Grille against in relation to those establishments, but I do feel that even though Capital Grille is a chain that they do a great job here in Pittsburgh at putting their own unique style into this location and even though it attracts the high-end business/legal crowd during the work week, it doesn't feel intimidating because of the warm and comfortable decor.   On this occasion our group requested to order ala carte from the lunch menu and they were more than happy to accommodate us when we asked them to be sure to reserve/make available the lobster mac and cheese and the bone-in filet for our group; two items which are not typically available during lunchtime.  We started with a few orders of the pan-fried calamari to share (we had a group of 15), and for my meal I ordered a caesar salad and the bone-in filet.  Our group also shared a couple of orders the lobster mac and cheese as a side dish.  I asked for the chef's recommended temperature on the filet and ordered it with the porcini rub and it was very tender and flavorful.  The lobster mac and cheese was perfect with large chunks of sweet lobster and the perfect amount of creaminess/cheesiness!  None of our group had any complaints and we all went home with doggie bags (or dessert to go) and happy bellies!    I would love to go to Capital Grille again for a more intimate dining experience with a smaller group of people, but I am looking forward to the next time that our bosses decide to take our group out to lunch there again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic  dinner. Highly recommended  if you are in the area the service was fantastic. Waiter was highly  imformative about the menu"}
{"text":"Capital Grille has always been one of our favorite places to go for a \"dress-up, fancy\" dinner.  We usually save dinners at this location for our birthdays or anniversaries.  As all Capital Grille locations go, the ambiance is outstanding and the decor beautiful.  The Las Vegas location looks over the strip, so if you can get a window seat, it's pretty cool.  You're right across the street from the Wynn and located on the third floor of the Fashion Show Mall. We usually get steaks here, as they are awesome.  The Porcini Rubbed Aged Balsamic Rib Eye is my absolute favorite.  The spinach salad with bacon is in my opinion, the best salad.  You can order lobster as an appetizer and they will pull it out of the shell and cut it up in to bite size pieces, which makes for a very fancy app.  The lobster mac-n-cheese is just awesome.  It's rich and has many pieces of lobster, so highly recommend this as a side dish.  The asparagus is also good. The last couple times we've been to the Capital Grille (2014 and 2013), we've been sat next to tables with children.  In 2013, in fact, when we were seated, we noticed a very large party that was coming in soon...as there was a huge, long table prepared behind us.  When they arrived, there were more children than adults and they were out of control.  This ruined the experience.  Last fall, 2014, when we visited for our anniversary, we were sat, and once again next to children...we asked to be moved, and the next table was also next to a child, which, thank goodness was quiet, but the table location sucked.  We believe that an upscale, fancy, expensive restaurant should have a section where they put people with children so the other people that are dining out and celebrating special dates can have a peaceful meal.  Because of these last two experiences, we've decided that we will no longer go to the Capital Grille for special celebrations...this is disappointing, as the food is always good."}
{"text":"We had an exceptional dinner tonight thanks to the Capital Grille crew and especially the Mngr. Drew that took extremely good care of us. That is why Capital Grille is hands down the best restaurant in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Pros:  - Great service  - Steak selection  - Reasonable cost for lunch menu  Cons:  - Dinner can be expensive but it's a high quality restaurant so you get what you pay for  Favorite Dishes:  - Lobster bisque  Great spot. Quality food. Outstanding service. Sides can be too much for an individual but you can order half-sized."}
{"text":"We went for our anniversary and the service started out as impeccable. There were roses on our table with a nice Happy Anniversary card. We were offered a complimentary champagne toast. So far we were very impressed.  We were offered fresh bread which was yummy and ordered a salad to split. The salad was okay, but not fantastic. My husband had ordered the Kona Sirloin and I had ordered the Filet MIgnon. Up to the main course, the service had been quick and we expected the same from the steaks. We waited and waited and waited.  Finally the steaks arrived and neither of us were impressed. I had ordered Medium Rare Plus because I like it nice and pink, but not red. It was too rare for my liking and the outside was more charred than I care for. My husband's sirloin was too rare and he liked my filet more. The sides we ordered were very good. I had the creamed corn which was wonderful. My husband really enjoyed his mashed potatoes.  They offered us dessert. We chose peach sorbet which was yummy. Then we waited again for our bill.   Overall, it was a decent meal and while the service started off outstanding, it declined as the meal progressed. Honestly, I have had better steaks elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ok steak.  Nothing special.  However,  they did put some confetti on the table for my father in laws birthday."}
{"text":"This place was delicious.  I came here for some steak and cheesecake.  I recommend this place for just that.  Cheesecake and steak.  Its expensive but you get what you pay for.  Do dress to impress, this place is a little upscale."}
{"text":"Great service.  Great food.  Great view.  Was an amazing experience, had the salmon the creamed spinach and the creme brûlée and everything was cooked perfectly!  They were quick and on top of the service!"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant from the service (which was impeccable) to the food. My date and I had herb crusted chicken, surf-n-turf, lobster bisque (the best I have ever had), prosciutto wrapped mozzarella with tomatoes (to die for), cheesecake and caesars salad. My steak was seasoned and cooked to perfection and seemed to melt in my mouth. I sat by the window and enjoyed the view. The décor was a bit dark for my taste but the service and food made this a non issue. The waiters and staff is what sold me here. They were warm attentive and personable. I was here for my birthday and they made it so very special."}
{"text":"AMAZING... let me start off with that.  So I originally made reservations to Ruth's Chris for my boyfriend's birthday dinner but I saw the menu for Capital Grille and immediately changed my mind and I'm so glad I did.  I made reservations on their website and mentioned it was my boyfriends birthday.  When we got there, the host and manager both greeted us and were very professional, wishes my boyfriend a happy birthday.  They let us sit at the bar for drinks before we sat down to dinner since the table wasn't ready yet. When we got to the table, there was a card signed by all the staff, happy birthday confetti that lined down the table it was wonderful.  The atmosphere was very welcoming, it was dim and very elegant but not overly done which I liked.  The bread they provided was warm and delicious.  We ordered the calamari for appetizer and let me just say... if you love calamari, THIS IS IT RIGHT HERE!!! its perfectly seasoned, breaded and crispy, and its mixed with banana peppers and tomato which give it a nice kick and some jazz. LOVED IT LOVED IT LOVVVVVED IT!  We then shared the porterhouse steak 28oz and it was delicious and perfectly cooked, a little colder than I would like it but at least they cooked it right.  We also ordered the lobster mac and cheese and paramasean truffle fries as our sides.  Way too much food for the both of us, we had to take half the steak, most of the mac and cheese and fries home but they were all delicious.  The service was amazing, our server was on point and very good, she knew the menu really well and explained everything to us.  The overall experience was a 10.  After our meal, the server came out with a slice of chocolate mousse cake with a lit candle for my boyfriend and it was on the house! They are so generous.  I'm a food junkie and I love food and this is by far my favorite, quality, restaurant."}
{"text":"Been around different steak restaurants in Vegas, though a lot of good ones, Capital is always my go to.  The steaks are cooked perfectly, and the service and ambiance are among the best in NV.  The side dishes are like the rest, but their seafood app is the best!"}
{"text":"My go to restaurant for special occasions!!  The view is awesome and the food is always excellent."}
{"text":"Everything here was amazing. The service was amazing. The food was beyond amazing. Great atmosphere. Recommend to anyone. The oysters were my favorite part. Great great food."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent flyer at this location and normally service is top notch, however, during a recent visit I made reservations for my younger sisters birthday celebration. I specified a booth when I called ahead of time for reservation as we had a small child in our party. I arrived, the hostess was cold and unwelcoming, she seemed quite overwhelmed at the time. She said i was the first to arrive in my party, and offered for me to wait or to take me to our table. I requested to be taken to the table. I then waited 15 minutes in front of the host stand, she did not offer to take my coat, or acknowledge me in any way. When the remainder of my party arrived I let her know, we waited another 10 minutes before she acknowledged us again. She, again, did not offer to take any of our coats, then proceeded to seat us at a regular table. I asked if she could take us to a booth as requested when I initially made the reservation, to which her reply was \"ummm, I dont know\" followed by an eye roll, as she quickly turned and hurried back to the host stand leaving us stand there.  They did eventually get us to a booth, quite some time after our reservation. But our entire experience was ruined at this point due to this young woman's poor attitude and the way we were treated. It was my sisters first time and she was thoroughly unimpressed. The whole situation left me outright furious. Despite the delicious food and good service from our wait staff I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Went here for a nice dinner but got something else instead....  I was having a bad day and my fiancé chose to cheer me up by taking me out for a nice dinner.  I ordered the lobster.  The server said it would be served traditionally and I could have them remove the meat then place it back in the shell to make it easier to eat.  I said they could do that.    I kid you not, the server came out with a plate of lettuce with a pile of small unidentifiable chunks of meat on it.  I looked up at my fiancé and he said \"you've got to be kidding me.\"  I was already having a bad day and this restaurant ended it by serving me what looked like a fish abortion.  We haven't returned."}
{"text":"The Capital Grille has never done me wrong.  My husband and I came here to celebrate our marriage on Valentine's Day.  We had a wonderful surprise with a champagne toast,  along with their chocolate torte for dessert.  To die for.  My husband had never been to a Capital Grille before.  So, when I ordered the lobster mac and cheese, he was skeptical because he is a health food nut.  But, when he was wanting to eat the leftovers cold the next day,  I knew he totally loved it!  I had the filet, medium rare, cooked to perfection.  My husband had the sirloin, also cooked to perfection.  Laura was our server, and she was fantastic.  The manager greeted us at the table and made sure we were happy with our service and our meal.  I have had this treatment at every Capital Grilled location I have been to.  You cannot go wrong at this place.  Its the perfect restaurant to celebrate a special occasion."}
{"text":"A very beautiful place to dine in casual clothing. The food is well made but not the best I've had. I ordered the plate of mini tenderloins and parmesian truffle fries, and the potato leeks soup. I've had many truffle fries before and these fries tasted like regular fries with a hit of parmesian and truffle oil. However, the sliders were awesome. In spite of the clear flaws, if one has a party to host and a strong budget, then this place is definitely recommended."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is relaxing with an old school feel to it. Our server was great and I really liked the special touches they did on the table for our anniversary. They also take a photo complimentary that prints out during dinner too. However, to be quite honest the food was just ok. The parmesan crusted sole tasted like only parmesan. The portion was huge though but unappetizing. I did like the green beans and the fries were tasty. My boyfriend did not care for the steak that much. The two different wines we had we did like and the salad for starter was good too. For the price and the lack of taste in the entrees I do not see us coming back."}
{"text":"We returned here for dinner as we had lunch here a couple of days prior. The service was exceptional. We had the French onion soup and it was almost burnt tasting. Think it was the cheese on top was over done. The Brussel sprout salad was good, but the bacon pieces were really COOKED. The au gratin potatoes looked like they were not going to be good, but were awesome. The asparagus was burnt on the tips, which kinda ruined that portion. The steak was cooked well and tasted spectacular. We skipped desert. We will try this again"}
{"text":"Great steaks, perfectly executed side dishes, exceptional \"steakhouse\" wine list, meaning lots of full bodied choices, all the names that some diners seem married to and just enough obscure stuff to satisfy those who prefer smaller vineyards.  For a chain, they've also done an amazing job of giving the place a local feel.  Wine lockers with name plaques at the entrance, walls adorned with portraits of Arizona figures and a bit of Western Chic decor all help to set it apart from locations in other cities.  Oh, and their lunch menu is reasonably priced and packed with great stuff.  Solid place."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch for the office. The online lunch menu was easy to read but the food disappointed. Since it was such a pricy place I thought it would be delicison, we were all excited. I had the chicken risotto plate with the clam chowder soup. The Risotto was salty, the chicken pink and sloppy. The soup was okay, blue water lagoon is way way way better. The plate was $20.00 and not worth it. My coworkers ordered the Caesar Salad with chicken also from the lunch menu ($17.00) none of the 3 ordered had chicken it was what seemed like $2.00 small salad. Last, coworker had the cheeseburger was not great.  Overall I would not go again and not recommend to a friend. Sorry Mr.Capital you disappointed."}
{"text":"Fine Dining is hard to find and Capital Grill ranks right up there. It's my favorite spot for a great steak and large selection of wines. I judge a steakhouse by trying the Rib-Eye. Capital Grill only serves \"Prime\" and yes, you do pay the price. This is not a \"cheap date\", and has become one of special occasion spots...anniversary, birthday etc.   The Rib-Eye here has the perfect marbleization and has always been cooked to perfection. Sandra K usually has the Filet, and has never been disappointed.  But I better mention the Lobster Bisque soup before detailing the steaks and sides. It is like a special sunset. Dazzling light, luminescent colors and a special moment. Not sure how's it's made...but to die for flavor. Salads are exceptional, except I usually go for the soup, but when I'm thinking healthy, I have the wedge or Caesar, or on occasion the bacon spinach. All worth mentioning.  Back to the steaks, again, I am a Rib-Eye fan but I have had The Dry Aged Steak Au Poivre with a Courvasier Cream Sauce. This steak is rubbed with crushed peppercorns and \"seared\" to lock in the juices. The cream sauce is such a delight. Don't mix the Lobster Bisque and this steak unless you want a decadent evening.   By the way, don't lke beef? Try the Double Cut Lambchops...fabulous! Seafood, I can't get myself to order seafood at a Steak House, unless I have Steak and Lobster/Crab. Then again, I get my Lobster fix with the soup or the appetizers.  Sides....This is why I like to take a group here. The sides are all \"shareable\" although there are several here that I don't want my companions to take too much. Parmesan Truffle Fries....ouch on the flavor scale (and other scales). Lobster and Mac N Cheese, again, I get my seafood on the side, this one is decadent to the power of 10 and one of my all time favorites are the AuGratin potatoes. To impress my guests, I will order a vegetable to share and it's usually the creamed spinach or asparagus. But sliding into decadence here means I throw out the rules of engagement and if I going to sin....here I am going to sin big, and that means dessert as well.  Coconut Cream Pie or Key Lime Pie at a fine dining spot contrast the other offerings of Flourless Chocolate Expresso Cake and Berries and Cream. Go for it.  I have had intimate dining here with Sandra K and most recently, hosted a luncheon for 60 persons in a private setting. Service has always been impeccable and the food is distinguished."}
{"text":"Really looking forward to dining here.  The food was just so-so.  The best thing on or off the menu is the pineapple vodka.   We've only been here once, and perhaps we'll give it another try, but there's lots of other fabulous restaurants  to spend money."}
{"text":"Love the Capital Grille and have dined at this location before with the excellent results but not last night. Big disappointment. My Brussel Sprout salad was so old and wilted was shocked they brought it to the table.  Bottle of red wine we ordered was too warm to drink and no complimentary dessert for our anniversary as is their tradition. Lots if steak in Vegas. Won't bother with this again so sad."}
{"text":"The dinner was great, especially the lobster Mac and cheese and the coconut cream pie. But the 2 fruit flies that were around our table were very annoying. Feel at this quality of dining there should be no insects !!!"}
{"text":"Super delish food here! Everyone loved their meals, but I can only comment specifically on what I ate (just don't have that great of a memory!) The filet mignon was cooked to perfection. The oysters were fresh and super tasty. The mozzarella, tomato and basil salad was great. We ordered asparagus and mashed potatoes as our side dishes and oh heaven! I love that they had 1/2 bottles of some great wines, perfect for one person when no one else at your table wants to drink the same thing. We went for a birthday celebration and they brought a very nice birthday dessert out. The service was excellent, as you would expect. The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is that it is so expensive...over $100 per person. Worth it though for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here during restaurant week. I had been wanting to go here and give them a try and this was the incentive I needed. Our waiter Jorge was one of the best waiters I have ever had. He gets 5 stars. He was never in the way. He came to your table when you needed something almost like he was reading your thoughts. He was no where around but when I dropped a fork, he was there with another fork in 30 seconds. If you go you probably can't get the waiter you want but if you can ask for Jorge. You will be very pleased. During restaurant week they have some set menu items for a set amount of dollars. Of course you can still get what you want off the regular menu.  I don't remember the cut of beef I got but I got a steak and my wife got a Filet. She said hers was very good. I got mine rare. Most places think when you order rare you really want medium rare. They did cook the meat exactly the way I like, a little fleshy in the center. My steak was good but not excellent. A little tough. We ordered the green beans. This was a huge disappointment. I am not sure where this started but green beans need to be mature and cooked, not picked before there is a bean in it and warmed up. Yes I know this seems to be the way you get them everywhere. I was raised where you go into the garden, pick the beans, string the beans, break them into 1 to 1.5 inch pieces. When cooked they are to die for. But now everyone seems to think a immature half cooked bean is the way to fix them.  The potatoes were good and our deserts were good.  If they knew how to cook green beans they might of got 5 stars.  Have a great day enjoy good food."}
{"text":"What an excellent experience!  Our server Chuck was so nice and attentive didn't make us feel rushed like some other steakhouses I've been too. He was very knowledgeable of the menu with great recommendations! We started off with the lobster bisque and French onion soup. Though you cant necessarily compare the two the French onion was my favorite. Definitely should've ordered the bowl. I also extremely enjoyed the filet Oscar with crab. The meat was so tender and the bernaise sauce  complimented it very well. On the menu most of the steaks did not come with a side luckily mine came with asparagus. We also ordered the lobster Mac and cheese to share. YUM! I'm a huge fan of Mac and cheese and this was probably the best I've ever had.  Yes it is a bit pricey but it was 100% worth it!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and each experience was top notch.  I am not into franchise restaurants but this is first class and does not give the stuffy atmosphere some other upper steak restaurants have.  I don't think my drink ever got below 3/4 before it was topped off.  As for the food, we shared the 22 oz Bone in Ribeye and the Salmon. Sides are extra but we had the mashed potatoes and asparagus. The mashed potatoes are almost creamy which I believe they mix sour cream and lots of butter for a pretty good taste. The asparagus is grilled which gives it almost a crisp snap taste.  We ordered the Bone in Ribeye medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. I was indecisive between the Porterhouse and the Ribeye and Shelby our waitress recommended the Ribeye because of the fat that would add flavor. Great recommendation! The Salmon was prepared perfectly also.  We have come here to celebrate birthdays and anniversaries and each time has been a great experience.   Last night we came to celebrate my son's 20th Birthday and Shelby brought out a complimentary dessert comprised of cheesecake and a chocolate cake. The cheesecake was exceptional!   Shelby was our waitress was top notch and so exceptional, she made our dining experience a very memorable one.  Looking forward to our next celebration here.  4/24/18 So my wife and I decided to celebrate our 25th Wedding Anniversary here and made a reservation through Open Table, when we arrived, we were seated at a table that was topped with graffiti shaped liked hearts and rose petals and an anniversary card from Capital Grille with a nice note. Our server Jen was top notch and we had the 22 oz bone in Ribeye and 14 oz Dry Aged NY Strip Steak along with asparagus and the au gratin potatoes. Everything was prepared as requested and then Jen presented us with a combo dessert that in the middle said Happy Anniversary with a Creme brulee cheesecake and a coffee mousse cake.. So we were asked by the manager if everything was good and the next day had a follow up phone call asking if our meal and experience was good. Solid 5 stars and love this place!"}
{"text":"Took two colleagues from work here for a belated, \"thanks for all you did in 2011\", lunch. I have never been to this location for dinner but had a kick butt good dinner at a Houston location a couple years ago so the lunch expectations were high.   The service was quite good but the food was just good which is not good enough at these prices. And yes, you are allowed to say \"these prices\" even at lunch at a place like CG.   HITS - Wedge salad. Very yummy blue cheese dressing, quality bacon, fresh lettuce and tomato and as big as your head. The hot, fresh bread and cold butter.  AVERAGE - Clam chowder. It had good flavor and a respectable amount of clams but way too many potatoes and was luke warm.  MISSES - Chefs burger. Ordered medium rare, served medium well and had barely any flavor to it.   Back to Ruth's Chris for next years thank you lunch..."}
{"text":"If it were possible to leave six stars I would! We were a group of four for a late lunch, and everything was perfect! Our server, Daniel, welcomed us and was very prompt in providing our drinks (yes, quite a few) and explaining the menu. The selections were varied and the completed products flawless. I simply love this place! After a couple of hours, Daniel was still going strong and would have stayed right with us, but the dinner crown was starting to arrive, and we felt it was time to depart. We all thank The Capital Grille for donating this four person lunch to the Arizona Musicfest, and look forward to it being offered again next year!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big steak person, but this is one of the best places to come if you are."}
{"text":"Ok stopped by this somewhat tired place again to get some food at the bar. As soon as I walk in this old musty smell hits you, and then the shaggy carpet in the dining room. A quick glance at the bar reveals a crowd of old timers. Already lost my appetite, although in the past the burger special paired with red wine always was good. Topped off by the Capital Grille Dessert, strawberries in ice and Grand Mariner. No not this time, the foul smell of the place made me just loose the appetite. Headed down to the more hip bar at the Ritz Carlton. What a difference, an excellent bar menus and nice scenery."}
{"text":"This is not a restaurant I would normally come to, but my boyfriend picked it for our anniversary last week (he somehow always picks steakhouses when I let him choose..)  We arrived at 4pm for our 4.30 reservation (we were also catching a show) and were promptly seated at a table by the window. They had a hand-written card thanking us for choosing them for our anniversary with heart-shaped sequins sprinkled on the table. We had a lovely view of the empty lot next door, which actually proved to be pretty entertaining. There were lots of drunk girls leaving the dayclubs at wynn/encore in their bikinis, and one guy who climbed out the escape hatch of a party bus and consequently had his entire group evicted from the bus. I imagine the people watching is probably less entertaining in the winter.  The food is pretty so-so, what you would expect from a chain steakhouse. I had the Seared Tenderloin with Butter Poached Lobster Tails and my boyfriend had the Dry Aged Sirloin. We also had a side of the Sam's Mashed Potatoes. My steak was more medium than medium-rare, which I have found seems to be a problem at many places; I would probably order it rare in the future. The mashed potatoes were melt-in-your mouth delicious and oh-so buttery. When I ate the leftovers in the morning it tasted like I was eating a stick of butter (to clarify, I think that sounds delicious).   What really put this from a 3-star to a 4-star review was all the little nice things they did for us for our anniversary. In addition to the cards and sequins, they also made us a dessert plate that said \"happy anniversary\" on it and brought out 2 glasses of sparkling wine. The waitress (Anali? Alani? something that started with an A) was friendly and helpful and really helped make our special day special.  Edit: looking back at pictures, I now remember that we also had the steak tartare. I remember thinking it was good at the time, but it apparently wasn't very memorable."}
{"text":"We visited The Capital Grille 2 weeks ago and had the most amazing dining experience here while in Scottsdale, AZ.  The environment is bursting with energy and the staff is on top of customer service.  We weren't sure what to order as the menu offered several great choices.  Our server helped us out greatly and we were not disappointed with the quality of the dishes served.   Meats aged and prepared to perfection. Side dished prepared and served with the true love one can have for a vegetable. It was impressive to see that a chain restaurant could have the level of care and compassion that a single Michelin Star restaurant would have."}
{"text":"A perfectly perfect first dinner here at a company private-room gathering for a group of 11. Beautiful presentation, delicious fare, and professional service. I had no clue this is a selective chain restaurant, so I frankly do not care. Beautiful restaurant that I see as a perfect locale in which to host private parties for two or more. The decor is pleasantly dark, deep, and rich."}
{"text":"Excellent. When I made the reservation, they asked if we were celebrating anything, I told them it was my boyfriends birthday. The table was decorated, along with a nice card for him. The service was excellent and food was amazing. We will definitely be back."}
