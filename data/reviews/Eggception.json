{"text":"I am glad my wife and I found this place. The owners are very nice and make sure the food is fresh and take pride in their service. The eggs Benedict plate I ordered was delicious with a perfectly prepared hollandaise sauce and complemented with fruit, an original \"potato waffle\" and a endless supply of good coffee.  The atmosphere is relaxing too. Overall a great experience and I am looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Great breakfasts, no lineup, friendly owners, fancy decor compared to the usual strip mall spots.  Potatoes are excellent. Great coffees too (Gaggia)."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome presentation, reasonably priced! Hidden gem in a strip mall with a nice Tiffany's style decor and spotless washrooms to boot."}
{"text":"What a cute place! I was across the street at my mechanic's (best mechanic in the world) Garage Manric and he told me about this place. I had a cappuccino and Eggs Benedict and it was all perfect. They make these home made waffle hash browns that blew me away. I don't even like hash browns and I loved these! Adorable little place, cozy, chic and great food! Highly recommend it for meetings, family breakfast, and perfect for a date... Even if it's a date with yourself! ;)"}
{"text":"Been hearing people talk about this new little breakfast gem that opened up on Sources in DDO. The decor (kind of a white french boudoir) is very pretty and gives the place quite an intimate feeling.  Service was very friendly and attentive. I had the Eggs Benedict Traditional $12 sans meat and my mom had The Classic 3 eggs breakfast $7.50. The hollandaise on the Eggs Benedict was absolutely delicious it came with waffled potatoes (yummy!), baked beans and fresh fruit on the side. The Classic was three small eggs cooked to perfection served with the same sides. The coffee was pretty good. The only reason I'm reserving a star for now is that one of my eggs was slightly overcooked. Will be going back for sure!"}
