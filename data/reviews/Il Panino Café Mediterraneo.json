{"text":"Sweet place next to school. Good for a super quick grab during your break and their paninis are much better than Tim Hortons so if you feel like having one this is what I recommend! They also have a variety of salads :)"}
{"text":"My favourite place to eat paninis!  This place is where I always eat my paninis. It's a nice, simple place with lots of tables. The service is quick and efficient and the food, delicious. There's lots of choices and you can take a panini with a side of soup or salad. The desserts are also wonderful!  It's perfect for lunch with coworkers or just relaxing and talking with friends."}
{"text":"This panini-specialized joint presents a huge selection of paninis at reasonably quick service with a short-handed selection of coffee (despite considering themselves a coffee place).  The place is fairly spacious with nice solid tables and seating. The lighting was somewhat dim but what bothered me were the prices. 8$ for a god damn panini? 5.50$ for a stupid salad? Does it come with free songs on ITunes? Admittedly they do taste good but not 8$ good.  Complete and utter rip off. Especially for a place that doesn't make the paninis on the spot and just refrigerates them all in the beginning of the day.."}
{"text":"Perfect quick lunch, pasta salades are the best one I ever had and the Atlantic Panino (Salmon) is awesome. Love this place, often crowded at lunch because of the university but it so worth the wait."}
{"text":"Clean, quick, well located, inexpensive, almost healthy food! Tried the steak épicé. Liked the bread, crispy and thin, the steak was juicy and yummy too. Salad are recommended. I was in a hurry did not try one. Also seems to have gluten free options (spotted a flourless brownie!) Inside is spacious there is outdoor sitting too. Convenient for workday noons !"}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch in the Quartier Latin (Ste-Catherine St.) area, near Berri-UQAM. I go there often for lunch. Service is quick, food is healthy and tasty. There is a choice of at about 10 different salads (greek, pasta, Asian, mango + bell peppers, spinach, apple, potatoes, legumes, cabbage) and as many sandwiches (mostly paninis, but also wraps, and they have many vegetarian options). They also have baked goods (muffins, croissants, biscottis, cookies, cakes...). I like their combos (I usually have sandwich + 2 salads + drink for 11$ taxes included). They also have one or two kinds of soups. They serve coffee and expresso drinks but they only have decaf in espresso drinks (which is not included in the combo, but I got away with a decaf Americano). There is a lot of people who take the food away so even if it's often busy, I never had trouble sitting down, even right around 12pm. I wish the cutlery were re-usable (instead of disposable). But it's one of the best deals in the area, with a wide variety of choice for lunch."}
{"text":"Une tres grande variete de sandwich ! J'ai essayé le trio avec un soupe et c'etait un diner parfait !   L'endroit semble un peu plate a première vue mais ne vous laissé pas avoir par le look car la bouffe est excellente !"}
{"text":"This is a sweet sandwich place close to school. They have Panini's, flat breads and wraps available with many different ingredients. I have now tried two Panini's (Le Di Parma & Le Campignard) and 2 flat bread sandwich's (Le Paysano &Vegano) and they were all awesome. They also have a wide selection of salads to accompany your sandwich. I've tried the greek, quinoa, sobe noodles with soya sauce and a pesto penne pasta salads and have zero complaints, they were all delicious and a perfect fit with my sandwich. Everyone that works here are super nice and helpful with my questions. They also have an espresso machine and make very good lattes. The décor is very white and neon green, they have lots of tables crammed into a small space but it is a good place to enjoy a good sandwich and get some homework done at the same time along with many other students. I will definitely be back. :)"}
{"text":"Really just meh.  I always feel uninspired by their sandwich creations. None of them scream \"Delicious\" to me.  I ordered the spicy steak one night and it was really messy and filled with onions! and it was 9$!! I just don't see myself going unless I really run out of options.  Staff is very nice though and I always feel so bad whenever I go in and never get anything!"}
{"text":"Good place for paninins that come with sides of different choices of salads. They have quick service and are conveniently located next to the Guy Metro station."}
{"text":"Excellent petit café juste à côté de l'UQAM, près des pavillons DS et V. J'y vais pour leurs excellents paninis et salades. Mon sandwich préféré est le Louisianais. Pain plat, poulet, sauce extra crémeuse et jalapenos. Ce n'est pas pour les petits appétits! Les salades sont aussi très bonnes. Mes préférées sont aux patates et celle à l'orzo. Le service est rapide. Bon endroit tranquille hors des heures de rush pour se réunir et faire ses travaux."}
{"text":"the paninis are excellent. IT went so well with my coffee and hit the spot . The distance from place des arts was a major selling point for me originally but i recommend going there for a fulfilling but not too heavy meal."}
{"text":"De passage à Montréal, on cherchait un endroit pour manger entre midi et deux ! On voulait que ce soit rapide et efficace. Le choix est assez intéressant : des sandwiches, panini, des salades ... On était 4, et on était tous d'accord pour dire qu'on a plutôt bien mangé, c'était bon, frais, la quantité idéale pour être rassasié mais pas au point d'exploser ! (bon après ca dépend aussi de si vous avez beaucoup faim ou non). L'endroit fait sa job et ca suffit. Cela dit, le personnel n'était pas spécialement sympathique ... Peut être étions nous tombés au mauvais moment, je leur laisse le bénéfice du doute et ne mets pas moins de 3 étoiles."}
{"text":"The former Sushiman is no longer at this address, but the lovely modern space that it was in is now the second location of il Panino cafe. They just opened last week and were sampling some of their baked goods and delicious espresso 'frappuccino' (with real espresso it seems).   I tried 2 mouthfuls of brownie (5 stars for this treat - and house made), a snippet of oatmeal and fruit galette (biscuit of sorts), plus what I believe was a chocolate chunk muffin (the two latter may be delivered unbaked and then baked onsite). All the samples were a nice touch to a newly opened place.  I heard their Panini sandwiches are the highlight, but I had already eaten lunch so for 6.95 I'll let you know another time.  The service was attentive and there was a nice vibe to accompany the modern decor and high ceilings.   I hope they use their niche and keep up the freshness and service since many students and other patrons are needed to keep the space warmed up since if empty this place would feel just that...empty."}
{"text":"If only I hadn't waited four months to write this review! Thinking of Il Panino and its rich, nutty coffee in normal-sized cups makes me miss Montreal all over again, and remembering the tender, flaky pastry wrapped around a nugget of sweet, earthy almond paste -- I'm a little misty-eyed with the memory.  Ah, well. Next time I end up in the dreaded green monster's lair, patiently explaining to the barista that I want a small coffee, not one of the three large sizes on the menu, while the woman behind me taps her foot impatiently and the guy behind her broadcasts his personal conversation for all to hear, I will remember you, Il Panino, and drink your health from south of the border."}
{"text":"One small salad for 5.46$ and it was disgusting. Too salty. Beeeeeuuuuurk"}
{"text":"They nailed it!  After a long cold cycling ride, we stopped here for a latte and hot panini.  Both were excellent."}
{"text":"We arrived in Montreal around lunch time and as our hotel did not have a restaurant we set out to search the area around our hotel for a place to eat. We saw a lot of Indian and Chinese restaurants but I was in the mood for a sandwich. We found Il Panino Cafe Mediterrano a few blocks from out hotel. It was just what I was looking for. A fresh pressed panino filled with Italian meats and cheeses with a salad on the side. They also have really good coffee. The young lady behind the counter was fast and courteous and the sandwich she made me hit the spot. If I lived or worked in the area I could see myself going back to eat there again."}
{"text":"Was craving a plain ham and cheese panini and they were able to accommodate, although at first they seemed hesitant. I guess they wanted to push whatever they had on display. The sandwiches and salads they have on display didn't really look too appealing to me, plus they didn't seem to have a whole lot of options. Overall the panini was ok. Probably won't be back."}
