{"text":"Ordered four things for delivery, only received two and a half. The half is because we ordered Red Thai Curry with Rice. I didnèt get the rice, just a big tub of curry chicken. When we called back they said they would get us the friend rice. When asked about a side of rice, they said it doesn't come with rice. When I initially made my pick, I chose it because it was under the subheading \"Rice\" how are you going to tell me something doesn't come with rice when it was UNDER THAT CATEGORY?!

They said they would give me a side of rice. However I wanted them to acknowledge that their meal comes with rice, and they weren't just being \"nice\".

Also forks an spoons + napkins should always be something that's provided... not necessarily asked for."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about the dim sum here. Unfortunately I was unable to try it as, despite there being many empty tables on both floors of the restaurant, they refused to seat my party of 4 because they were \"too busy\". I've never been flat-out refused service at a restaurant before. So if you do decide to go check out the apparently legendary dim-sum here, perhaps call first and see if they're in the mood? :("}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place for dim sum and have been back twice since so my review is based on take out and dine in dim sum.  I don't come this way often but had to bring my mom to her doctor nearby so we stopped in to pick up some take out.  Found out afterwards that my mom's doctor has been coming here for the past decade (they even have a reserved seat for him... so I'm assuming if it's good enough for him, it's fine for us).  It's a push cart system so the downfall is they don't always have enough food by the time the cart rolls around (also depends on which side of the restaurant the cart woman decides to roll out).  My suggestion is get a seat near the kitchen if you can.

We we're pleasantly surprised with the quality and size of our portions and even more surprised with the prices.  Everything we ate was good except the lotus leaf (a bit dry) and don't expect caviar on the dumplings for the price you're paying.  The decor is dated and not all that impressive compared to the fancy places but it's not any worse than those on the other side of the city downtown.  It's Ok for this side of Chinatown as it won't embarrass the family but it's not very spacious and it won't win any awards for design.  The service is a bit slow and they were definitely slow in refilling our tea.  Service is 3 star or less depending on the time or how busy it is.

Unbeatable value: Take out or dine in is $2.80 a dish for large size har gow, sui mai and cheung fun ($2.40 if you check out before 10:30 AM)... Holy cow Batman!!! Rol San is 50% higher and the lineup is much longer.  Crown Princess and Dynasty is in a different quality league but easily double the price.  It's a huge difference if you like to go often and not so much if you're only doing dim sum a few times a year so definitely worth the trip east.  Bang for the buck is excellent and worth the drive or transit ride compared to the other Chinatown on Spadina.  Definitely go to place for regular dim sum but won't impress your boss or a date and unlikely place for dinner given the many options available elsewhere that is more convenient.  Still worthy of a solid 3.5-4 stars for dim sum quality and value :)."}
{"text":"A nice place for Sunday dim sum, but it is always busy. we had line up for more than half hour, but food was very good. back here for sure."}
{"text":"I love this cheap and cheerful dim sum spot. It's a great place to go with one friend or a large group. The selection is pretty good but sometimes they run out of my favourites by noon. The options are always a bit different. You can expect har gow, siu mai, sticky rice, rice flour rolls, a variety of sesame balls, fantastic taro dumplings, and all kinds of steamed and pan fried dumplings. I have never tried the deep fried selection or the dessert cart but there are many options there. Sometimes there are special treats like pumpkin and pear dumplings made to look like tiny pumpkins or pears - cute and amazingly delicious! The barbecue pork buns are good but not always present. Expect a short wait if you come after noon. Service is via traditional dim sum trolleys. There are always plenty of extra workers to ask for tea, your cheque, or a takeout container. It's not the freaking ritz of dim sum but I've had a lot of dim sum, and this is good food."}
{"text":"The lovely ladies who come around with the carts always make our dim sum outing a pleasure. They know how to up-sell in such a cute and friendly way, that sometimes I just want to go along with them because they're so friendly and happy to help.

The food is pretty decent for the area, but not comparable with uptown dim sum places. However, the prices make it a good value meal. I think the restaurant was renovated not too long ago, and is definitely much less grungy than most of the surrounding options, making it our neighbourhood go-to place when we're in the mood for Chinese food.

So far I've only been here for weekend dim sum."}
{"text":"For dim sum, on 2nd floor:
Old school dim sum with carts coming out of the kitchen, and some dumplings fried to order (you can see them near the door). Good for the area and decent selection; more variety comes out closer to peak times. A fair choice if you don't want to travel far or are in the neighborhood with a big group.

Some dishes are more on point than others. Was disappointed with the hagow (too much msg) but really like the gauchoygow (shrimp with gauchoy). The wohteep (pan fried dumpling) is house made, large and very meaty; personally prefer more gauchoy in that one too. Decent were the fried taro dumplings (wu gok), hamsuigok (deep fried glutinous rice dumpling), fujookguun (bean curd meat roll), and egg tart (flakey crust!). Didn't see any 'phoenix claw' (chicken feet).  Calamari looked overly breaded.

All in all wouldn't mind returning to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Great food and quick delivery. All the dishes had their own great flavours. No sauces that made everything taste the same. Great refreshing experience to previous mediocre Chinese places in the area. Loved the Dim Sum and the General Tso chicken which had spice and not just covered by sickly sweet day glo sauce. Definitely will be ordering from this place again."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here a few times. Wasn't a fan of the wonton soup of the noodles but the dim sum is AWESOME. I want to live off of the stuffed crab claws. DO IT!"}
{"text":"it was pretty good for my first visit. we went really early like 9ish on a Sunday and it wasn't busy at all. so service was quick and food was good too."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dim sum on Sunday in the mid-afternoon. 

Arrived to a nearly empty dining room, not a good thing for dim sum. Took a couple minutes to get someone's attention to show us to a table. Decided on our order, chose the classice, steamed shrimp dumplings, fried pork and chive, lotus leaf-wrapped sticky rice, beef balls, steamed pork dumplings, fried calamari.

First out was the calamari. It was cold. And stale. And oily has hell. We had a couple bites and shifted it to the end of the table. Out next was the shrimp dumplings, which were good. Waitess noticed the full plate of calamari and that we weren't eating it. She asked why, I told her it was cold. She took it off our bill. 

We enjoyed the bulk of the steamed and fried dumplings. The sticky rice was terrible, full of mystery brown meat and tons of hard chunks (please god, tell me it wasn't bones). So bad.

Service was okay, a bit rushed. 

Wouldn't go back. Would rather battle the hordes of dim-sumers on Spadina."}
{"text":"I couple of my friends decided to grab some late nite eats recently and told me to meet them at Pearl Court in East Toronto Chinatown.
Always a little leary of new places, I was actually pleasantly surprised!

For my meal, I ordered spicy vegetarian pad thai and for only $10-$12 got a ton of food! I was thrilled. Yay lunch the next day!
My friends also ordered 1 dish each and got more than enough to eat. 

I recently returned to Pearl Court with my husband and again we got nice big portions and the food was quite tasty.

Admittedly, it's not a place to eat every day as some items are fried and the food can be a little greasy but it sure tastes good!

The service is also fairly pleasant. 
The only downfall is that they don't sell hot bubble tea. boo."}
{"text":"Good food at average prices for chinese. Great portions and food comes to the table quickly. The staff are the average chinese food experience with not the friendliest demeanor but attentive and efficient. Love the fried rice. Noticeable pieces of real chicken not the questionable processed chicken other places serve that's rubbery abd chewy."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that I've been going to for years.  I've tried all types of meals there - dine-in, take-out, delivery, lunch, dim-sum (weekday and weekend) and dinner.
I know it's not the best Dim Sum in the city, but it's still quite good, and it's a very good value.  If I'm going for GREAT dim sum, I'll go to Pearl Harbourfront or Dynasty in Yorkville, but I'd put this as more of a casual, wallet-friendly choice, almost as good as Rol San on Spadina.
For me, where they really leap into 4-star range is with their delivery service.  I've only ordered for dinner, but it's always been fantastic.  We live in a city where far too many Chinese delivery places proudly serve chop suey and sweet and sour chicken balls.  It's nice to have a place like this where people like me, who grew up on Lee Garden and Happy Seven and Rol San can order good quality, authentic Cantonese food in the east end.
The soups are all very tasty, the noodle dishes are prepared in the way your remember (though they're great at making substitutions, like chicken instead of beef), and the fresh seafood is worth the price of the order alone.  You can get lobster, crab, live spot prawns - whatever is fresh and in the tank is available for order and delivery.  These items are not on the menu, but if you ask the person on the phone, they'll tell you if there is any good fresh seafood.  They will even let you order some dim sum items, if they haven't run out.  They're great at filling any special request.  We often order Chinese broccoli with prince mushrooms, which is not on the menu, but they make it for me!
Some real stars on the menu include spicy eggplant with shrimp, deep fried seafood with garlic pepper, deep fried black cod with soy sauce, rice noodle with beef and black bean sauce, deep fried crab claw appetizer, pan-fried shrimp with chive dumplings (dim sum) and if you're feeding kids or the unadventurous, the fried rice options and moo shu pork are also VERY good!
The food has always arrived hot, within the quoted time, and they use good quality take-out packaging.  They know how to pack up the food so it travels well.
No website, and no menu online, so you'll have to drop in to pick one up.  Or just call - they'll make whatever you want and send over a menu for next time!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but the service will leave a bad taste in your mouth. 

The service is arrogant, dismissive and slow. They will bring the food without any regards for people at the table eating at the same time. When I brought up the fact that some people at our table practically finished eating before others meals arrived, the waiter gave me bewildered look and rudely replied: \"Food arrives when the kitchen finish cooking it\"

I guess I'm not going to be arriving again to this place any time soon."}
{"text":"This is on the 2nd floor - for weekend Dim Sum.

Clean dining room and all the staff were friendly and attentive, that was a real bonus and stand out compared to other places.

Food was good, though it's the carts, so you may not get what you want if you don't stay long enough.

Prices were nice - cheaper than the usual place we go to.

A couple of the items were more moist then I think they should have been.... a pork pan fried dumpling should be firm and crispy, but they were soggy.

Overall I'm impressed with this place when compared to others in the downtown chinatowns."}
{"text":"We have been going to Pearl court for a while now as it's convenient, decent food and easy with toddlers. Tonight's experience was awful! 
We were seated, waited 10 minutes for menus, I finally went up to grab some. 
Finally our order was taken, the waiter who took our order was disinterested, distracted and stopped listening half way through the order. 
Food started arriving and was raw. The Ha gow shrimp dumplings were translucent and mushy, not cooked at all. Another shrimp dish arrived in the same state.
No apology although we were told they would cook some more dumplings for us. Those dumplings arrived as we were on our way out the door. 
We never received the following, an additional set of chop sticks, plates (as we were short 2), napkins and water which finally arrived as we were leaving and after asking every wait staff in the restaurant. 
We didn't end up receiving everything that we ordered we were so disgusted and ended up leaving. Imagine serving raw food not only to adults but to 2 year old kids. 
No apology at all. Seemed everyone in the restaurant was having a similar experience, customers were irritable and food was been sent back. 
There are way more restaurants in the city happy to have our business, won't be returning."}
{"text":"great cheap cantonese eats on the east end! i just moved near the neighbourhood and came here on a friend's recommendation. love the beef fried ho fan, but the beef fried rice needs some flavour - nothing a little chili oil can't fix!"}
{"text":"I really gave up on pearl court years ago.  But today I didn't feel like driving too far from home. We had low expectations going in. But it was wonderful.  

It's dim sum upstairs at noon when we arrived and said we wanted menu items, they sit u downstairs for that. 

Seafood tofu hot pot $11.95.  It was huge. Has so much of everything. Shrimps, scallops (big ones) calamari (a bit chewy, if u have kids cut those in small pieces. They don't take vein out, easy for a little one to be choked on, honestly I would avoid serving the calamari to anyone teeth challenged) tofu braised and broccoli.  The taste of the sauce was so ginger and onions.  8 out of 10 

Beef with onions and crispy rice noodle in black bean sauce $9.95.  Oh those noodles ; the dish actually was egg noodle on menu but we asked to substitute., they did no problem and no extra cost, sooo tasty and crispy, like Cantonese chow mein noodle ,  9 out of 10.  Not greasy 

2 pots of tea, one Budweiser.  $31 plus $5 tip. (Beer is a rip off $5.50.). 

Will return when not feeling a drive to Markham, scarbs or spadina"}
{"text":"*DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT*

My grandmother was ripped off by the waiters and manager during an afternoon lunch service at this restaurant this past Monday, August 21, 2017 at around 2pm.

We paid for the meal using a $100 dollar bill and the  workers claimed we only paid with a $20. They refused to show us the till nor did they give us a receipt. Unfortunately we did not call the police while we were in the heat of the moment. 

Buyer beware!"}
{"text":"Absolutely atrocious.   Never again..   1100pm on a Friday night,  the entire kitchen  staff is on break.   U kidding me!   After 30 minutes,  waiting to order,  we left never to  return.   Yr not the only game in town.   Totally disrespectful to their clients.   I can't control their behaviour,  but we can  determine where we go out to eat,  and it won't be Pearl Court."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times over the years but my last visit was two days ago and it was one of the worst dim sum meals I have ever had. The rice in the soft rice noodles with bbq pork had turned. The turnip cake was not too far behind. The siu mai was horrendously over-salted. The tasteless pork and veg dumplings felt like they had come out of a bag of frozen dumplings - and as if to prove that point, I found a thin snipping of plastic bag with mine. The char siu pau, sticky rice and pai gwat were passable - which was a great relief. They brought our egg tart dessert order to the table before any food arrived and then they forgot about our mango pudding order when we were done, all while the staff were having a jolly chat in the backroom. The hygiene seems to have taken a nose dive too and the table covers were grimy. I am sorry to say that I will not be going back. Pearl Court appeared to me to be depressingly like a restaurant that has sentenced itself to a slow death."}
{"text":"My family used to come here all the time as a kid, for birthdays, anniversaries, well basically any special occasion that happened was celebrated here.  That's probably the one reason I'm giving them 1 star, because I've had some fond memories here.

The restaurant used to look nice for standards for the 90's, but now it looks completely old and falling apart.  The place still has the horrible pink and green colours across the walls and exterior and they haven't had a chance to update the furniture in ages.

When it comes to the food, the quality has dipped beyond recognition.  Like an old friend you knew in high school that was the captain of the hockey team, who now has a pot belly and works at Canadian Tire.  The food is bad, super greasy and packed full of MSG.  On top of this on 2 occasions I have had insects in my food.  The first time, we decided to forgive them as they said it was part of the vegetables.  The second time however, shocked me.  We ordered a pot of steamed fish which we always get and when the lid was lifted a hoard of ants came crawling out!  I couldn't have made that up from a horror novel!  To add insult to injury they only offered us 10% off our meal for that disgusting ordeal!

Needless to say my family and I will never be coming back here again.  It's sad I know, we tried to like it.  We even tried to deal with all the excuses they had for years, but when it's time to say goodbye you just have to keep going and not look back.  Look back at that boiling pot of fish with ants crawling all over it..."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. Yes it is nostalgia with the carts and the people here are the same people I remember pushing carts around almost 20 years ago. 

The food here isn't bad but also not great. The chicken feet are kinda large where as most places have moved to cutting them into smaller half pieces to make them easier to eat. Most of my complaints are that they didn't make the minor changes to make the dining experience not pleasant for people. The service is slow like one lady wandering around with the same food she was advertising to you the first 3 time she came around. There is a question of freshness by the 3 trip around and is there a rhyme of reason to when the rice rolls come out versus the Ha Gow and Siu Mai versus silken tofu dessert. 

Overall the food is pretty decent to good. And the ladies do a goos job explaining in their very limited English what the dishes are to the adjacent table to non-Asian diners who are wondering if there is a shrimp Siu Mai, which is met with the words Ha Gow, this one is pork, and pointing at the Siu Mai. 

If you're downtown there are fewer and fewer locations left and Rol San is another options and I'd says the food might be better here barely but consider what side of town you're on and whether you want to be waiting. You won't wait for a table here but you do for you food. 

Sorry no photos wasn't much to take a photo of and we were hungry and with my parents so photos were a etiquette no-no."}
{"text":"Dimsum here is awesome! Fresh and always hot. Crowds come for a reason. Get the pan fried dumplings with red wine vinegar that you see them frying up on the way in !"}
{"text":"Not the cleanest dim sum restaurant but damn their dim sum is good. Price is fair, I'm busting and the 4 of us have spent about 50 bucks with cokes all round. Pretty good selection, and the ladies with the carts are kinda fun."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite dim sum place in the city. It get really busy on weekends but the room is huge so you won't wait long. Cart service only runs over the lunch hour."}
{"text":"Ever since I've been able to eat, I've been going to Pearl Court; whether it is with my parents, a date or friends. The prices are very reasonable, the quantities of food ample and the service professional. It is written up in various newspapers and recommended by Zagat and Now Toronto, although many of the reviews date back to the mid-nineties. The ownership has changed throughout the years and as such the cuisine has, and it is not quite the pearl in the court of Chinatown East, but it is still a failsafe option for late-night revelers in the area. The flavors are sharp and defined, with no \"Canadian Chinese\" influences evident. The specials on the wall change with the season and the seafood is fresh. There are times when the food doesn't live up to how it usually is, so if there is any problem I have with Pearl Court, it has to be the inconsistency.
All in all though, it's good, solid, authentic Chinese food at a great price."}
{"text":"I give them only 1 star because of my family's experience there. Went here for a family dinner (big table of 10 of us). We are Asian and very familiar with Cantonese cuisine. We found the food pretty decent this time (sometimes it is hit or miss). However, a big issue we had was the service. There were a lot of white customers that day and it was not full, but staff seemed busy since nobody served us. We waited over an hour for our food which is completely ridiculous at any place, and even more so at a Chinese restaurant where service is usually fast. We also noticed that tables of white people were getting served before us, even if they came in after us. When we tried to flag the man whom I think may have been a manager or something as I always see him here (or maybe he was just a waiter too), he made a face, turned away and brushed us off rudely when we told him we'd been waiting an hour, rather than apologize, explain and look into it. White people continued to get served, and finally we did (after more than an hour). I smell racial discrimination, which is sad when it comes from your own people (some Chinese people feel that white people should get better service - this is sadly not uncommon). We don't plan to return ever again. We would have walked out but we were a big group, had already ordered, had already been waiting forever, and were starving!"}
{"text":"Solid dim sum. Not a long wait and fast service. Prices are whatever but food is always fresh and good."}
{"text":"This place gets my vote for the best hot and sour soup in Toronto. And their weekend dim sum is also top drawer.  Other great dishes here include paper wrapped chicken, which has a spice combination I've never seen replicated anywhere and a sweet walnut chicken that is excellent.  Seafoods here are great.   The shrimp are larger and fresher than most places.  

Like Jimi, I was reluctant to review this place.  I had been coming here for years and was just finding that I could not longer enjoy the place.  The food was still good, but the ugly, giant room just seemed to get brighter and uglier with each visit.  Luckily, someone intervened and after some renovations, the place is much more comfortable.  

I'm reserving the fifth star because the room still feels a bit too big during evening meals.  They need more diners or a way to make the room feel more intimate.  I think I'll go there right now."}
{"text":"Dim Sum, with carts, reasonable prices, and closer than most for me.

There's no question that there are better-regarded Dim Sum restaurants in Toronto, and with good reason. If you live/work near one of those, I don't think you should go out of your way to come to Pearl Court. But if you live/work in the east end, you'll probably be happy to have Pearl Court around.

This is solid Dim Sum, but it's not significantly better than average, in my opinion. The ambience is fine, but nothing exciting. The service is fine. The pricing is decent, in keeping with local mid-range dim-sum pricing.

They have carts, which I like; it feels like part of the Dim Sum experience to me.

Near as I can tell, this is the best dim sum in Chinatown east, and it's reasonably close to my home and one of my client sites, so I come here somewhat regularly. I'm happy it's here."}
{"text":"The food was actually ok.  Ordered a steamed tilapia, and they actually run next door to the market to get a fresh fish (like right out of the tank).  It was fresh.  It was a bit pricey.  But it was good.  

But the service.. yikes.  Only one wait lady and she was running around in circles in no particular order.  It wasn't too busy and we probably waited 20 minutes to get in our order, and it took another 45 to get the food.

Decor is just plain old run down old.  And normally all of this can be forgiven if the food was good (which it was pretty decent), but for the price point it just needs to be better.

This is like a canto-restaurant straight out of the 80s, which was probably the last time I was there."}
{"text":"This is THE place to go to for dim sum if you are in the area.  I absolutely love and adore the older ladies that's been here since I was a little kid.  The décor is nothing fancy and they gone through some updating and renovations in the past.  

Some of my dim sum favourites are (yes, in order of importance):

pan fried chive and shrimp dumpling, tripe, curry baby cuttlefish, deep fried shrimp roll, steamed bean curl roll, pan fried turnip cake, fish stuffed eggplant, fried shrimp dumpling w/mayonnaise, ha gow.

Tip: for those who like their hot sauce, it is available for purchase at $5 a glass jar :)"}
{"text":"Food is ok, but I am finally getting sick of the rude, presumptuous and unprofessional service by a staff that seems to be all members of some christian cult!..."}
{"text":"This is located at the lesser known Chinatown of Toronto on the east side. My friends love to come here but it's my first time. 

Unlike the yum cha place uptown in Markham, the restaurant hark back to a more traditional vibe where they still push the cart around between the tiny spaces of the tables. You come here to eat...not too much of decoration to it

The crowds are actually more heterogeneous than the ones uptown.

The food is authentic and very cheap. The service is actually surprisingly good. The staff were patient with our table of ppl who couldn't really speak Cantonese and with my very \"white\"friends who had to ask what is in every single dish...

I couldn't really take many pictures coz the food were gone as soon as they were put down...so I only managed a group shot lol"}
{"text":"This place is very hit or miss. Some dishes like their Singapore fried noodles are awesome, but others like their chow mein are a soggy, metallic tasting mess. 

They have a fantastic location with very nice decor and ambience. If you ever get a chance to go for their lunch Dim Sum you won't regret it. They have staff pushing carts around with fresh orders, and asking what you would like next. 

Be very careful if you have allergies. Once when ordering a delivery, I made very specific and clear instructions to not include shrimp in my girlfriend's dish, as she has a severe life threatening shrimp allergy. When we opened the delivery, we noticed that they forgot to omit the shrimp. When we called back, they offered to remedy the issue by sending us another dish for free (without the shrimp this time). When we opened the second delivery, guess what? We had shrimp once again!! I called them back and was confronted with a dismissive and rude reaction to my complaint. The phone was hung up on me, so I had no choice to call back the next day and speak to a manager, who ended up refunding my money. I just hoped they learned to be more careful with people's allergies."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in this place. Food was good but not impressive, and way overpriced. Service was poorly paced and very inattentive. The restaurant itself is cramped and ugly. That's a summary; here's a long version.

I went for dim sum on Thanksgiving day with one other person. There was a small line but we were seated quickly. Unfortunately, with the poor layout, we were practically on top of another table of two. In fact, they had to help us order because it was too loud for us to hear the women manning the carts.

The carts. My god. The entire time we were there, a solid 1.5-2 hours, I saw maybe seven or eight. That's not 7 or 8 different ones, either - this counts duplicate items. We gave up after 4 dishes and asked for a menu. The service immediately started to improve - food came out relatively quickly. They actually had a good variety without the stupid carts.

That said, it was still a huge chore to get water or napkins, or ask where an item was (which we had to do near the end, and didn't get a clear response). The servers here aren't bad because they're bad, they're inattentive because they're overwhelmed. They need at least one more person.

At the end of the meal, I was really surprised by the cost. I noticed that many dim sum items were around $4, even for smaller dishes. This really added up, because the portions aren't big. The taste was good, but nothing special at all. Throw a stone anywhere in Markham and you'll find at least two places as good, if not better. Not worth it at all. Not coming back."}
{"text":"The golden days of Pearl Court as the grand palace of Chinese cuisine in East Chinatown have long passed. This place is a shell of its former self. Unless you're a die-hard and the restaurant holds a nostalgic spot in your heart, there is very little to recommend the food here. There is an early bird Dim Sum special prior to 11 am on weekdays, but the quality is often worse than the frozen kind. The regular menu is overpriced, unspectacular, and an insult to the working-class neighborhood that it serves."}
{"text":"One of my favourite foods is dim sum. So when I recently moved into the neighbourhood I was thrilled to learn that this restaurant is about a pleasant 15min walk from my pad. I've been going there for lunch for the past few months and it has been consistent and tasty everytime. The staff are decent. Especially the ladies who push the carts around, classic dim sum style. They smile and say thank you and even talk to your kids. A major plus with me. The servers seem weeded all the time and are hardly there. But the cart ladies make up for them in my eyes. I find the food pretty good and fair in terms of price. They even have crab claws and chicken feet, my favs! This place gets pretty packed on the weekend mornings all through early afternoon so expect to wait about 10-15mins if you're a deuce and maybe more if you're coming in a larger group. All in all, it's worth the wait and the food hits the table like lightening. They've made sure that the cart ladies go by every table, even if you're way up front furthest from the kitchen. Which in most other dim sum restaurants with the same serving style you'd be SOL'd sitting so far away. Definately give this place a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I don't really eat Chinese food or dim sum after some bad experiences years ago but my friend suggested we come here late one night after some social drinks. I'm glad I agreed to it because everything I put in my mouth was delicious. My friend did the ordering because I know nothing about the food. I ended up eating a crab claw (a tiny bit of crab surrounded by some fish/shrimp paste sort of stuff battered and deep fried) that was like a seafood chicken ball. Very good. I had oysters that were served on the shell with some kind of savoury broth. The highlight for me was the soft shell crab which I'd never eaten before. It was spicy and juicy and exactly what I needed in my life after a night out. Other people have rated this place in a sort of crappy way, I don't if there is better stuff out there somewhere I haven't tried or if I just lucked into the right dishes, but given my limited experiences of Chinese cuisine I have to say I was fully satisfied and will definitely return."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for siu yeh and both times I've been very satisfied with the food and delighted by the fact they're open until 2am. It's my favourite late-night place to eat in town. 

The deep fried spicy bean curd is delicious. The bean curd coll and fried onion cake are good also. The veg spring roll, sticky rice and dumplings are okay but not amazing."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Recommended Custard Bun. The place is much better than Rol San at Spadina, don't mind drive a bit, it's worth.  Not overcrowded."}
{"text":"Came here with \"The Fin\" & friends for dinner. 

We ordered to share with each other, braised short ribs, snails in black bean sauce, sweet & sour pork & Singapore noodles.

The ribs were delicious, tender & went well with snails, snails of which were very tasty having soaked up it's black bean sauce. I had a bit of a surf n' turf thing going eating land & sea meat in alternating rapid succession.

 Sweet & sour pork was very good as it possessed a crisp outer layer, was moist on the inside & was completed with a light glaze of sweet & sour sauce.

Our base food to eat everything else with was a platter of Singapore noodles with shrimps & scallops, this was a very good dish, variety of flavor with a bit of spice. I was satisfied with the taste & quantity that came with this order.

Overall service is good & portion sizes are generous, decent place for some Chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"Went there in the afternoon so it wasn't busy.  The dim sum was good. Very quick service. Stuff was friendly and polite. Very inexpensive. Fairly clean."}
{"text":"I come here intoxicated a lot.   More so when I was younger.   The food is great and the service is good.   Try the fish."}
{"text":"All the Chinese restaurants in East Chinatown are in my opinion disgusting, even by generous Asian working-class standards, and I avoid them like the plague. Pearl Court, practically the only Dim Sum left on the block now, isn't the absolute worst I've seen, but it is right up there in the terrible experiences department.

The front window and vestibule is plastered with framed restaurant reviews and awards from the 1980s and 1990s. Maybe this place was the shit back in its heydays, enough to earn a Zagat recommendation. But the Pearl Court of today is a skeleton of what it supposedly once was.

I am guessing the ancient reputation was why Pearl Court was my family's go-to restaurant whenever we have guests and want to take them out for dinner. That is, until the time when we showed up as a group of ten. We were completely ignored, all standing at the front waiting for somebody to accommodate us. Fuck that shit; we left after five minutes of getting no attention. (Since then, we go to a nearby Viet joint. Lest I digress.)

But let's assume you managed to snag a table. You will find that there are two floors of operating dining space (who knows what the third floor leads to), and I often find the non-Asians are seated together on one floor. The decor is dated, dim and dirty, heightened by the grimy chairs and tables. If you think the service is bad and unapologetic, wait until you try the shit food. A lot of it is bland, too oily or cold when it shouldn't be. I have tasted frozen jacked-up-on-MSG grocery dim sum that taste better than Pearl Court! So much for quality; I think I have even gotten sick from it once.

The one star rating is earned for that one time they had a server named Justy. That's what his name tag said, and that's what I remember best after all these years."}
{"text":"So. This place does a traditional method of serving Dim Sum like they do in many places in Hong Kong which is bringing around a cart for you to choose the dishes you like. 1 point for that.  

The plates and bowls were greasy and dirty so we had to clean them with our napkins. -1 point for that. 

We ate: Shao Mai, Shrimp dumplings, leak dumplings, pork \"ribs\", spring rolls, and egg tarts. 

The Shao Mai weren't anything to write about, nor were either of the dumplings.  The dumpling skins weren't made with very much care. They easily fell apart when picked up. The pork ribs were mostly fat.  The egg tarts were too doughy and dry. The spring rolls were pretty good though. 

I've been to and eaten in Hong Kong many times and was quite disappointed."}
{"text":"3 stars based on a decent cashew nut chicken dish.  The decor is old, really needs a revamp.  Its one of those places it's probably best not to see the kitchen (less than clean interior).
Needs some paint, lose the gross carpet."}
{"text":"Pearl Court was the last available option for a couple of friends and I. The time being 10:44 and our usual spot was about to close, thinking that we din't want to prolong the nice workers close we settled on Pearl Court. We ordered half a Cantonese poached chicken w/ Ginger scallion oil, Sweet and sour pork, Chicken chow mien, beef chow mien and bowls of rice for the each of us. The food came fast, a little suspiciously fast I would have to say. The Canto chicken came first, at first glance I was wondering where the meat was. After some scrounging i was happy to find a piece of chicken that wasn't 80% bone, my initial reaction to the taste of the chicken was wow this is really bland. Texture was nothing but rubber, it reminded me of the gum that sat in gumball machines for to long. 
               
               It was missing the freshness i had from every other Chinese place I've been to. My friend had thought they served us a old chicken that they dipped in hot water for 30 seconds to show to illusions of freshness.  The other dishes weren't as bad, the chow mien was a bit soggy when it came out. The meats from both dishes would melt in your mouth as it was molded from some sort of powder. Lastly the sweet and sour pork, it was more batter than pork. 

In summary 
Cantonese poached lacked freshness and edible substance.
Chow Mien meats did not taste like meat. 
Sweet and sour pork is more like Sweet and sour batter"}
{"text":"Good Olde fashion dim sum with cart service. Brings back the memories.  Cleaner than most Chinese restaurants in Toronto.  Cart women were friendly and quick.  Food was good but I was famished and craving dim sum so it could've been a 3 star on another day.  Pretty pricey but I do eat like a pig and was extremely full after."}
{"text":"Decent dim sum food my parents always brought my brother and I there. I still go there once in a while, the workers are nice. There is a language barrier if you don't speak canto/mando but the old ladies that bring out the dishes know how to describe the dish well enough for you to understand. This is a place that brings back memories and it's been around for a long time. The only decent dim sum place downtown."}
{"text":"i want this place to be better.  

i mean, things are as they are and that is what it is, but id like to like this more than i do because there isnt a better one close by, and id rather have a short walk there, especially i think, since i live five minutes walking from chinatown east.

pearl court is a large restaurant with two floors.  now im not sure i totally understand how this works, because sometimes ive eaten dimsum downstairs and other times upstairs.  the most recent was upstairs and since dimsum not veggie friendly at all, i went by myself.  somehow this seemed more weird than any other solo dining experience ive had.  maybe because it was bright in there.

anyhow, i sat there reading for a short time because nothing appealed to me.  their selection of items was decent ranging from standards like shoomai and hargow to chicken feet in a gooey bloody looking sauce.  i didnt get that one.

if there was a large group of people and i had someone else who was interested id try it out, but its hard when you go by yourself for dimsum.  chinese food is all about the share.  needless to say i was very selective with my one man eating extravaganza.  

the shooooomai i ordered  was hot enough and alright.  i had a bowl of cut up squid that i had to send back because it was cold.  (only did so with the unwritten permission of the mother/daughter asian pair who sat beside me and were peeved that there food was cold also.  thanks for the courage.)  so we both were outfitted with new ones.  i still didnt eat it.  ive had better; it was quit rubbery.   

the last bit of tasty food i remember having was the lotus leaf with the rice and pork inside.  at least i think it was pork.  i could never quite get that answer from the woman who served it.  i recognized the dish, but it seemed there were two kinds (each with a different filling) and given my best efforts in trying to decipher the contents from her description i couldnt.  somehow i thought it was better to just say yes to the last one she said rather than risk the awkwardness of asking her to say it a third time.   i did notice a disc of sausage in there, so theres a bit of an answer.

hopefully in my yelp travels i will find a better dimsum place just as close or close enough to warrant a walk of a few blocks further."}
{"text":"Delivery was faster than expected,  kind of the only big plus.  Fried tofu with coriander was good, broccoli with snow peas. . . . Was fresh and tasty but man for $9 I expected more! 
We ate here years ago and decided to get delivery after a long days work. . . . Hoping that nothing had changed. It's either changed or thier delivery customers don't get the same food.
Either way, we'll likely try elsewhere next time.
Oh! Also beware the surprise $2.50 fuel surcharge when adding your tip ;)"}
{"text":"Ya - upstairs dim sum joint with cart service that seems to mainly cater to non-Chinese patrons - so... umm... ya.

I guess the bright point is that they actually have quite a few vegetarian items, which pleased my lady friend.  Also, it's not extremely oversalted like the 'dim sum' you'll find at Rol San (ugh).  And the push cart ladies are definite charmers and quite friendly - I suppose to cater to the crowd.

But it was surprisingly expensive, 'small' items were $2, 'medium' is $3 and large is $4.  For $4, I except either monstrous sized dim sum portions or fucking good dim sum - this was neither.

I suppose it's 'not bad' for downtown dim sum - but ugh, I can't give this place anymore than 2-stars, no interest in coming back here again."}
{"text":"So apparently for dim sum there are 2 types of ordering styles: the main floor is where you select what you want directly from the menu, while the 2nd floor they push the carts around for you to choose. Even though the carts style is more authentic, I much prefer the directly ordering because you can get what you want without waiting for the carts to come by your table. 

We were a large group of 10+ and apparently only the 2nd floor had large tables. The hostess was accommodating that she allowed us to order directly from the menu when we insisted. I think she was the only one there fluent in English, because many of the people pushing carts spoke very little English when we asked what's inside the carts. 

The food was your typical run of the mill greasy dim sum, I honestly didn't remember how it tasted because it was nothing special. I did really enjoy the deep fried octopus tentacles, though it wasn't part of the dim sum menu so it was more expensive. We spent roughly $9 per person after tax and tips and were left semi full after the meal."}
{"text":"I've been going to Pearl Court regularly only for their dim sum because it is convenient.  If there is no hassle travelling to a dim sum place downtown..I definitely would go.  I continuously go here due to my uncontrolled cravings of dim sum.  Their service is good.  However, their food is either a hit or miss.  They push the trolley and call the items out loud.  Sometimes their food are fresh, other times their food is in room temparature.  I think it depends on the time you go...go at a busier time where they will constantly make fresh food."}
{"text":"The service here is awful and extremely slow. The kitchen is severely understaffed. You can expect to wait close to 1hr for your food to arrive despite the restaurant being pretty empty. Prices are also much higher than Chinese food on Spadina Chinatown. 

The restaurant also has no ability to  accomodate those with a physical disability. The washroom is in a cramped basement and there are no elevators available.

Overall, I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Pearl Court has definitely seen better days. We ordered one of the set menu dinners and some items were definitely better than others. The service was okay, they were nice, but lacked being helpful. Some of the cutlery and dish ware have been bleached so many times that the first layer has melted off...

Crab meat fish maw soup lacked both crab meat and fish maw, and you can tell there was a lot of cornstarch (or whatever thickener they use) and MSG.

The worst part was that they served us the seafood bird's nest WITHOUT the bird's nest because they were out of stock and \"that's that\" (loosely translated from Cantonese). They apologized but I can't eat an apology and they could have forewarned us when we ordered it or even before cooking it.

Funny, because we had to add money to the set menu dinner because the lobster was supposedly larger than the one included in the menu, BUT they didn't deduct any money for not giving us a bird nest. Shame."}
{"text":"We were in the area and decided to come here for dim sum. The restaurant is a fair size but a bit outdated decor. They have push carts for dim sum, but it always seemed to be the same food coming around. The food was fine but not excellent. The price for the food was similar to other places, but they charged 1$ per person for tea. Not sure if I will return."}
{"text":"Nearly my worst dining out experience in Toronto.  I found the dim sum to be generally uninspired and unappetizing.  Not sure If we arrived too late?  The selections were meager and uninteresting, and the service was atrocious, particularly for an  English-only speaker.  Tried a beef soup from the menu and it was so bad I could not believe it.  I mean, I'll eat almost anything, but this was far worse than instant ramen!  It truly had no flavour at all.  How hard is it to make a little beef soup?  Took forever to send it back--and the manager was none too happy about it--no apology, was put off, and wanted to charge me for it anyway!   

I think to have a good time here, you need to go with the flow, get dim sum, speak some Chinese, be assertive, and have some detailed knowledge of what's on offer.  Casual diners should not wander in here."}
{"text":"Love the place as a late night snack ... there general Thai chicken is bomb... and I love the shrimp ... servers are friendly and food comes hot and fresh"}
{"text":"A place that serves dim sum at 2am wins me over no matter what. An alternative to late-nite-after-the-bar-only-options-on-spadina (new ho or rol san generally) this place is a late night gem in the east end. 
It's definitely going to be my go to late night spot from now on."}
{"text":"Hello Yelpers....

{"text":"Been here many times over the years, quality has gone downhill.  This use to be the place to go, now they are the only dim sum place left in east china town.  With no competition, they can server underwhelming food and people still will go there cause there's nothing around.

Dim Sum is pricey, large dim sum are 4.00.  And trust me, there quality is not worth 4.00.  Your better off driving to T&T, its much cheaper and quality is on par with them.  They have a early bird for 2.80 or something, but I didn't get there on time.

I reluctantly went there for dinner last year cause my father didn't want to ride the dvp up to Markham.  The quality of the food was terrible, like done by a amateur cook. and the food was soggy.  Only reason I go there is cause its easier for a family meet up cause east china town is close to my house.

I usually go up to Markham for food, we go there so much, we were sick of it.  So we decided not to travel up.  But that was a mistake, we paid over 200 bucks for a course meal, and it wasn't worth it at all."}
{"text":"Was in for Dim Sum last Friday with an old girlfriend who eats very little meat.... so no pork or beef... shrimp yes.... everything including the vegetable sticky rice was as good as ever... the only problem was the cock roach that walked across the table... the hostess apologized stating they had just been sprayed the previous week... I was expecting more from them since I have been a regular here since Grands Seafood closed some seven years ago but will not return anytime soon...."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for lunch.  The restaurant wasn't too full and there was more of the caucasian persuasion than I expected.  No racial, just observing.  We immediately started selecting stuff from the various dim sum trays being carted around.  We began with the shuimai, a scallion dumpling, rice rolls with shrimp, and sticky rice with pork.  All were good.  But then it seemed like we waited forever for them to bring around and offer something different  than the initial offerings.  This wouldn't be a problem if you're in for a long leisurely lunch, but as it was, we were dining with a two year old getting dangerously close to nap time.

We flagged down someone who looked official and asked if we could order chasiu bao and har gow.  We were graciously accommodated.  We rounded off the meal with three egg tarts.

Honestly, I enjoyed my lunch and for $27 with tax and tip for the three of us, I think it's a great deal.  Also, I really liked the fact that I didn't have to line up forever and hover awkwardly over someone's shoulder for an eternity while waiting for a table like I do at Rol San.  Pearl Court was also quiet enough despite the many full tables, that you could actually have a conversation without yelling.

In short, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Refused to delivery. I called, they took my order and my credit card number, after 5 mins they called me back said they don't delivery to my area. But I ordered before to be delivery to my apartment area. I think it's very unprofessional and rude. Do not order from them"}
{"text":"I have come here for many years and whether its weekend at the height of dim sum rush the food is good.  The best food however is served on off hours when the dim sum can be ordered off the menu and is served fresh from the kitchen rather than from a cart.  The only reason it only gets 4 stars is because the wait times for food from the kitchen are hit and miss.  I definitely suggest you go but make sure your time is open because you might have to wait longer than usual for your food."}
{"text":"I haven't come this place for months. I usually look for the good food and enjoy the time with family and friends. One night, I picked Pearl Court. Just because I missed their delicious hot and sour soup. We had red curry with mixed veggie, General Tao's chicken and stuffed crab claw (deep fried). Curry got my taste buds into action. I like to eat curry with steamed rice, yummy. General Tao's chicken was crispy, sweet, little hot, tender and really tasty. I loved to eat  their classic stuffed crab claws, so savory. That's the reason why many customers order it. I will buy it back home next time. Great food and at a reasonable price. Therefore, the owner can run a successful business for many years in Toronto."}
{"text":"Pretty much a Chinese staple on the east end! I come here often with my sibling and dad when we don't want to trek to (the other) Chinatown on Spadina. All day dim sum with lots of Chinese dishes.

The food is decent enough, not the worst I've had but not even a contender for the top 10 Chinese places. Some dishes are a hit (sweet and sour pork) and some are a miss (general tso's chicken). The dim sum is passable but not memorable. Don't come here expecting nice decor either.

What this place does better than most Chinese restaurants in the Spadina Chinatown is their service. The staff is always welcoming and responsive."}
