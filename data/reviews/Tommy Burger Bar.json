{"text":"Tommy's has good burgers (and a good name). Sliders to start and a burger main. Is that wrong?  :)  Fries in a cone. Nice presentation.   I think they hire wait staff on cleavage first and service skill much after.    I go here every few months."}
{"text":"I can't call this THE most pretentious place in all of Calgary, but I think it's up in the running. What makes it personally offensive is that they're pretending burgers are some sort of gourmet specialty. They aren't. The best burgers are soaked in grease, covered in cheese and flavour. And enough fat to clog your arteries. This place sells you a frozen pub patty you could buy anywhere for $10 and then proceeds to charge you extra for freak toppings like field sprouts and avocado. I know every female probably thinks this is fantastic, but it's not. That's not what hamburgers were made for. The setting of this crime is bizarre as well. It's an ultra-modern theme with booths and open tables amongst clean, anti-septic walls and windows. It gets expensive when you order a beer and a side of fries (expect something like $35 for two) and I personally feel you can get better for the price. Go to Fat Burger and bring your own field sprouts because that at least is a real hamburger patty.... In fact, one afternoon I showed up just to ridicule the place. We had a beer and watched some baseball (they do have decent tvs behind the bar and ice cold beer) and then a line up started. I'm sure the servers don't deserve any abuse, but those fools who waited in line for 20 minutes deserve whatever they get. I was finally able to talk two older ladies out of the place, suggesting they'd feel better about themselves after the meal someplace else. You know, I could see spending money on a really good burger, but this just isn't it. If they were homemade and tasted completely different from every other place, then fine. I just want them to stop pretending the hamburger is something fancy to fawn over. If they get real, I might go back. In fact, their fries aren't bad. Maybe they can call themselves a special fry joint who happens to have burgers. Yes, I think that sounds better...."}
{"text":"Good burgers... was expecting a little more of a lounge atmosphere but overall the experience was a good one."}
{"text":"Tommy Burger is a great place to go to for big burgers while watching a sporting event of your choice.    The Flames game was on while we had dinner there and no matter where you're sitting there is a TV screen that you will be able to watch.    The burgers we had were really big, I had trouble trying to take a bite out of it at the beginning.  The patties are seasoned well and it usually comes with lettuce, tomato and onion for garnish.  I had the original Tommy burger with sauteed mushrooms.  I think the mushrooms were a little bit bland and didn't really add any flavour to the burger like I was hoping it would.  I chose the tomato basil soup as my side and it was really good.  Slightly creamy soup which tasted a little bit sweet.  My partner had a BBQ Blue Burger with a side of fries.  His burger was also really good.  He was definitely full at the end of the meal and couldn't have any dessert.  For about $30, we had 2 burgers and one cocktail, which I thought was reasonable for a good hearty meal."}
{"text":"Must admit that the burgers at Tommy Burger are a whole lot of burger! (I couldn't even finish mine.) Tasty ones at that!    One this recent trip, I opted to try the Lonestar burger.  The meat was perfectly seasoned. Just the right amount of everything topping wise.  Bacon was a thick cut - definitely no scrimping.  Had to do a little squishing to get it to a point where I could actually bite into it, however.  French fries were decent & I splurged on a side of gravy, which was most tasty and reminded me of homemade gravy my grandma would make, rather than a commercially prepared mix. Lovely surprise.  Pickle fries were AMAZING! This was my first experience & I wasn't quite sure what to expect. The breading was nice & crispy. Having been fried, I was expecting a somewhat soggy pickle, but not at all.  Will definitely be trying these again.  We managed to luck in on Caesar Sunday - they are all $1 off then.  Had the original & was good enough that I would definitely get one again.  Our server was friendly & attentive, without being clingy. The restaurant was clean & bright.  Music not to my tastes, but not everything can be perfect. Lots of TV screens if you want to watch a game while you eat.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good burger this is one of the best places to go. Huge fan of the blue cheese burger. Great fries too."}
{"text":"Awesome burger joint with great burgers, shakes and fries. The burger was done just right, and there was great service."}
{"text":"When you are looking for a gourmet burger fix, this place hits the spot. Kat and I have come here about four times, always trying something new and leaving satisfied (though lighter in the pocket). What is most consistent is their shakes: just a sip of the chocolate shake with leave you in heaven, eagerly awaiting the first (impossible) bite of your giant burger. The burger that sticks out in my mind is the blue cheese burger, mainly for the excess of blue cheese. A lot of flavor that distracted from the otherwise great patty. The kobe sliders are also quite a treat. It is a trendy place, with lots of TVs and fancy bathroom facilities."}
{"text":"Tommy Burger is definitely one of Calgary's top 3 \"gourmet\" high end burger joints (i.e. this ain't no Five Guys!).  The decor is nicely \"urban lounge\" in feeling, and the staff is cute and fun (and yes, I'm talking about chicks).  I have eaten there 3 times over the past few months, and twice the burgers were perfect, but once it was overdone.  The garlic fries are supreme quality for a burger joint (and almost remind me of Indochine's fries, for you Calgary foodies who recall that seminal restaurant in Bankers' Hall).  I also like how there is an alcove of sorts for families with children (who are definitely very welcome here).  I would have given it 3.5 stars on a scale of five, but since I always round up (even on my tips!), it gets a 4 from me.  If you are looking for a great burger (and I'm talking along the lines of the legendary Shake Shack in NYC) - you must come here, and don't forget the order the garlic fries!  Just make sure your date gets some too ;-)"}
{"text":"Tommy Burger is where you would go if you're looking for a 'gourmet' burger.  It really is different from other burger joints and I enjoy it because of that.  They have every f-ing topping you can think of and you can load as much junk on it as you like.  They have everything from mushrooms to guacamole to fried eggs to chili.  I would almost say it is comparable to Johnny Rockets... which is an awesome place.  The prices of the food isn't outrageous, considering how much you actually get.  I am always STUFFED when I leave this place... almost to the point that I'm ill.  I've ever actually been sick from Tommy Burger, only extremely satisfied.  If you love burgers, and you know how you like them, this place is a great burger joint.  It's different and fun!"}
