{"text":"At check-in Cibola Resort folks mentioned The Haymaker (when you go show your room key for a pleasant benefit).  We were sat in 1 of the 2 booths facing the bar.  Shielded from all the commoners (ha). Travis our Server, turned out to be the Bar Tender.  Great attitude and great service.  Made the statement that he figured we were staying at Cibola because \"everyone around here has been here before, and knows the menu, including breakfast, is served all day long.\".  Pleasant place.  We got the Oriental chicken salad and chili.  Breading on the chicken was very good.  You should ask for a extra thing of dressing with your order.  The fried green tomato BLT with a avocado was good and juicy.  If it wasn't my lunch time, I'd have tried one of the Eggs Benedict that Travis bragged on about.  Ok it is past 6 pm, Mike and Jill can handle it. See photo"}
{"text":"Food is media ore at best. The racist T-Shirts sealed the deal for me. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Iffy at best. Not a lot to the food and not much better atmosphere. Breakfast is its only saving grace."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My boyfriend and I were traveling through the area and decided to pop in. The burger was great but the best part of our experience was our little blonde server named Nikki. She was the best! I don't normally take the time to write reviews but we had the best time with Nikki. She was attentive, funny and always made sure that not only we had what we needed but we were having fun. I definitely recommend this spot if your looking for above and beyond service with your food and a drink."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Our server Marshall was very kind, attentive and knowledgeable. Was also impressed with the cleanliness of the restaurant and bathroom. Will definitely be returning to the haymaker!"}
{"text":"Haymaker is our new favorite neighborhood hangout!  It was a much needed establishment for our area!  We have enjoyed numerous items off both menus and have not been disappointed!  Food is flavored nicely and cooked to perfection.  We are regulars at the bar and are always promptly greeted by Sal or Mark.  They offer wonderful suggestions and their service to top notch!   Keep up the outstanding work!  We are so excited to have Haymaker in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Meat was tough and the service wasn't that great. They forgot to put all of the food on our platter that was ordered and it took our waitress over 30 minutes to run out tab. We gave it a good try however this will be the last time we come back."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place. Me and my husband have date nite here every Thursday. Great service awesome bartender best Old Fashion in town..."}
{"text":"I was in this evening with my family had a very nice experience.  I had the tab sandwich and my husband had the lariat Burger. My husband had a fried egg on top of his Burger it was great . The food was delicious and  no complaints at all.  Our waiter Eric did a great job and was courteous and friendly. Will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Food was awesome and friendly staff. My wife had the sun dried chicken pasta and she loved it. I had the Texan burger, very good. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Just ate at the haymaker for the first time since they opened. I had the half sandwich Ruben with side Caesar salad. The sandwich was good and the salad dressing was very good. Also had the bread pudding which was so good! Would definitely have that again. Got there just passed the cut off for breakfast, but the chef went ahead and made breakfast for my husband. The prices are a little on the high-end and the drinks are too expensive. Three dollars for a glass of iced tea is too much. Next time we just won't order drinks. The atmosphere was very nice inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was a little rocky at first, but now that it's been around for a while, we really enjoy attending for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Really good food! The service has always been up to par. They have a wide variety of things. Glad to see mom and pop restaurants like this popping up in Peoria!"}
{"text":"Food was great! David the server was adorable and delightful! Ask for him! Great lunch spot! I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"My husband and I, along with a couple of friends, gave this place a try not too long ago. The place was dead, but we figured this was due to the fact it was later on a weekday evening. The space they have there is fantastic, but seems to be haunted by the ghosts of the many restaurants that failed before they moved in. Anyways...  Overall, the food was a tad underwhelming. I have had way better cheesesteaks at the food court in the mall! My fries were decent though. I ordered an old fashioned and was hoping for a better presentation then what I received. It seemed like the restaurant wants to boast that they have a great bar with knowledgable staff, but we must have got the D squad.  That being said, we were well attended to by our waiter overall.   I probably wouldn't go back to this place because nothing seemed to stand out about it. My advice: there are plenty of upstanding American restaurant/bars that Haymaker's can't even compare to."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant. Our waitress Miranda was awesome very pleasant and always on top of filling the coffee up. Food was great came out hot. Kids liked their pancakes and eggs. Biscuit was a huge hit with our daughter they are huge biscuits by the way. Both husband and I had omelets which were good. We will definitely be back to see our favorite waitress Miranda."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in North Peoria is Haymaker Restaurant on Happy Valley and Lake Pleasant.  I went in for a drink or two and a order of Fried Pickle Spears - they use their own beer batter and they are spears, not slices and the batter is great.  This place also is always is being innovative and has a burger of the month.  Today it was a hawaiin burger.  While Jenna (bartender x trondainire) was making sure I was taking care of; Mike the Manager allowed me to order a custom chicken breast that was battered in their beer batter.  It was the best sandwich I have ever had! The peoria crew really has it together and knows how to take care of their customers."}
{"text":"Great breakfast!!! Angel our server was excellent and very attentive. The potatoes are amazing.   Very reasonable."}
{"text":"Stopped in because we are new the area and had breakfast,  food was great and service was as well. Great place to stop in loved the small rustic feel."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast here last weekend. Hadnt been there before. Eggs Benedict was pretty good and my husband had the Haymaker Benedict,  wow what a great plate of food. He loved it! Service was great! Lots of tv's around for watchin Sunday football. Will definitely go back for lunch and dinner. Oh and FYI kids under 10 eat free on Wednesday with purchase of regular entree..."}
{"text":"I'm not a foodie, so I won't pretend to be one.  But after going to The Haymaker, I committed to the manager, Dan that I would provide feedback on Yelp, so here goes.  From the moment we walked in and were greeted by Sierra at the front door, we knew we were in for a pleasant evening.  Rarely today do you see such a bubbly personality that clearly radiates joy as much as she did.  This gal was something special.  Too often, the host is a young person who has no idea what real customer service is.  Not Sierra.  The smile, the small talk on the way to the table, her uniform, her persona...perfect in every way.  She's a real find.  She turned us over to Christina, our server.  Hard act to follow, but Christina delivered.  Not too obtrusive, not an absentee server.  Just the perfect amount of presence and personality to compliment our dinner.  My wife had the Rustic Burger, while I had the Patty Melt.  Both were terrific.  Soft bread, cooked to perfection and delivered piping hot.  Half way through the meal, Dan, the manager came by to check on some tables.  To Dan's credit, clearly working as expo to help his team.  Took a break from a hot kitchen to ensure guests are well cared for.  This guy really seemed to enjoy his job.  Very personable, just enough small talk to be hospitable but not obnoxious.  We finished our meal and exited with Sierra opening the door for us and thanking us for coming in.  Again, something rarely seen with today's younger worker.  Often times, the host is buried in their iPhone, paying no mind to customers.  We shared some compliments with Sierra and encouraged her to keep up the good work.  From the host to the server to the manager to the food....Haymaker is a winner.  We will return and will not hesitate to recommend to others."}
{"text":"Environment and atmosphere wasn't bad however, we waited roughly 40 minutes to receive our food.  My friend ordered burritos and the portion was very small, comparable to a fast food breakfast burrito.  I ordered French toast and they were very soggy and mushy.  I couldn't eat them at all.  Hopefully their lunch and dinner menu/food is better."}
{"text":"Service is terrible. 1 good bartender. You figure out which one.  THEY fired all the good ones. Play some other music. A little rock or a Variety. God Damn i phone country Shit all day. Love a little Bon Jovi.  Don't get me wrong i like country but Jesus Christ. A little rock and roll.  GOD BLESS AMERICA."}
{"text":"First time here and most definitely not our last. The ribs are AMAZING. I didn't actually order them, I just stole them off my husband's plate.   I must be an awful person because I tried my daughter's  chicken fingers too. Ps - ranch is homemade and awesome!  Oh yeah, I had the sirloin.  Cooked to perfection and very tender.   Overall, super family friendly,  great drink list, good service.   I highly recommend.  Just don't invite me because I will certainly eat off your plate too."}
{"text":"Great food great staff. Awesome place for breakfast! And if your staying at the Caboila Resort you get a discount."}
{"text":"Food on the menu reminded me of Denny's with a cowboy type theme. Very basic, nothing that special. If you like whiskey, they have quite a variety. The host and waitress were friendly and accommodating. I was hoping this place would remind me of The Vig.... nah, not so much."}
{"text":"Not recommended. After a wait time that was double the estimate, my family was escorted to a corner of the restraunt with an unpleasant odor. Every child surrounding our table had their crayons and coloring mat. I had the pleasure of fighting my way through their crowd to retrieve these items for my daughter myself as they weren't offered to us. I'm writing this pre meal, but even a stellar meal won't make up for the inept staff we've encountered so far. Save yourself the trouble if you're looking for these types of entrées and just go to black bear diner instead. We will from now on."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for an average night out to eat or for lunch. Had the Lariat burger, nothing too special but still a good burger. By the taste I'm assuming their meat if naturally raised cows from Montana. Good prices as well!"}
{"text":"I came here with my son after a baseball game and preparing for the next game. We started at happy hour with some very good deals so we ordered a couple drinks (beer and soda) and some fried pickles. The fried pickles were good but using the spears and some very tangy dills made the flavor a little too zesty. I have had fried pickles at other places and typically they use slices vs. the whole spear. Next my son ordered a burger and I ordered the Arizona. The burgers were not very flavorful but the bun was good. The green chilies on the Arizona felt like they were from a can. Along with my Arizona burger I got the side of baked mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was not flavorful either. I was a little disappointed.   Overall, even though the food was pretty ordinary the happy hour, restaurant feel, and service would allow me to give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"WILL NEVER GO BACK, SPENT $35 TO GET VERY SICK!!!  I ordered carryout a few nights ago with my wife.  We ordered the fried Zucchini whic was just okay. I had linguine with chicken which was tough and could not be chewed.  The linguine  sauce was dry and sticky and gave me diarrhea.   She had the pastrami  sandwich  with fries.  She stated that it was quite ordinary, not juicy and had no real quality meat.   It was  nothing exceptional except  the fact that she didn't get diarrhea ike me which isn't much of a comment!    WILL NEVER GO BACK!!!"}
{"text":"Stellar service  , was greeted immediately by the staff , they made me feel very welcome on a busy labor day weekend  , I tried out the pulled pork and sweet potato fries and was tempted by the wings so I had to try them , the pineapple habanero chicken wings were amazing ,good vibes , positive attitudes , Haymaker I will definitely be back ."}
{"text":"Food.....ok Service......poor  Was hoping to find my Sunday football bar but I guess I'll keep looking.   Waited 10 min after being seated to get a server to greet us.  Tried to order a hotdog and was told we don't serve lunch until 11:30, it was 11:05 at the time.  Server had no personality, never smiled and rarely checked in with us.  I saw the manager, our server and 3 other staff members talking for at least 5 min at the entry way instead of tending to the customers........what a disappointment."}
{"text":"Pretty good food! A bit pricey for what you get, and the fries always seem to come soggy, but overall a good place to eat and hang out. Laid back environment. I wish they had more selection."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! Pulled pork sandwich and Arizona burger were so good! BBQ sauce should be bottled! Dan, David, and Kathy were GREAT!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! Not sure if our server was new or what but our server Raquel was bad mouthing her coworkers in front of her guests! She was complaining to another table about how the \"kitchen was messing up everything and not doing anything right\". So rude! Completely unprofessional and makes me not want to come back. Also she kept forgetting our orders and got sassy when we corrected her, and gave us attitude whenever we reminded her of something we told her before. On top of it all, the food came out late and cold so it was definitely sitting for a while. Not happy at all! Haymakers, please get your act together."}
{"text":"Had the best breakfast this morning! Try the California Omelet. Cooked to perfection along with the hash browns."}
{"text":"We love Haymaker! The food is always great and the atmosphere is fun and casual. I would recommend it to anyone in the West Valley."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to trying this place.  Half an hour after placing our order we asked to speak to a manager because we still haven't received our food.  20 minutes later, after asking for a manager 3 times and still no food, we just got up and left."}
{"text":"We visited the Haymaker on 1/27/15 and were so impressed!!  We were greeted right away upon walking in and promptly seated.  Our server Seth went beyond with WONDERFUL customer service, he was very attentive, helpful and so pleasant.  Sad to say but its hard to find someone with great over the top customer service these days and he knocked it out of the park!!! The manager greeted every table making conversation and making sure everyone was enjoying themselves and their dinner!  It was a wonderful experience and we will be visiting again!!! THANK YOU for a new great place in Goodyear to eat!!!"}
{"text":"We have been to the Haymaker 5 times now and it never disappoints.  It is nice to have a non-chain restaurant in the area that has very good food & service.  The decor is great also.  I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I live nearby and after giving Lakeside a few tries, we are glad to see a privately owned restaurant with a different concept.   We checked it out initially with a Groupon deal of some kind, but return here regularly. There was one time we had poor service from some waitress, and although I see her there , we were only served by her one time.   Otherwise, service is good, food is good (breakfast and dinner), and they have good beer taps. Although this is more of a restaurant than a bar (doesn't stay open too late), the Happy Hour specials are really really good, and the beer selection is great (Firestone IPA on draft?!! YES PLEASE). Especially since Squid doesn't have good drink specials anymore.   For anyone who has lived in this part of the neighborhood for a while and haven't checked out the Haymaker, you owe it to yourself to give it a try."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my wife , who has celiac , the restaurant had a dedicated menu. She had vegetarian burger with a gluten free bun . The service was great . Our waitress had knowledge of celiac and was very helpful . We have gone back and service was great ."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Shane was our waiter and he is the best! Very knowledgeable about everything on the menu and super friendly. Great atmosphere, great drinks and great food! I had the country fried chicken and I definitely recommend it!! My husband and I will be coming back often!"}
{"text":"Drinks are good, but just had the nachos and instantly felt sick. Will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"Sadly this place is so bad that one star is VERY generous.  Food is bad, service sub par at best.  ONLY good side is TVs Which  from bar is a neck strain.  There appears to be no effort or initiative towards good customer service."}
{"text":"I didn't like it. 3 stars for atmosphere and bar may be cool. Waitress was annoying & kept trying to push us out for some reason.?. There wasn't a wait & we were quite... Don't know the ol' fat girls beef with us. Food was average at best....  Mann.. I was kinda sad it was so blaaa... We live close. But lots of other stuff around us so no major loss..."}
{"text":"We've tried their Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner and all I can say is their \"Food is excellent!\"  Manny the manager and his crew are awesome. They deliver quality service all the time."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, prepared perfectly.  Lots of choices to make everyone happy.  Wait staff is knowledgeable and friendly.  Even though it was crowded, we never felt rushed.   Relaxed environment.  We enjoyed it so much, that we went back the next morning for breakfast.  Very happy with that service also.  When we return to AZ, this will be at the top of our list."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Service really slow with really no crowd on a Monday. Appetizer cold, then waited to order lunch which again took a while. Had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. Nice portion but over cooked and a bit greasy. Not impressed, like the 8th restaurant there in 10 years. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great place. We have had breakfast and dinner here several times. Food was right on each time. The atmosphere felt as a smaller restaurant should. Servers were polite and checked back on us regularly but not too annoying as some do... Will eat here in the future."}
{"text":"Good place for any meal, but breakfasts are the best!  I have been to the one in Peoria many times when we lived on that side of the valley. This one is just as clean and also with competent servers. We stopped during lunch hour and had no wait to be seated. Absolutely no issues with the food or drinks! Reasonable price and portions. The wife and I will be back for breakfast sometime soon..."}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever had! Food would have been descent if the waitress was even slightly pleasant. They could not pay me to return to their establishment.  Total turn off!"}
{"text":"Great steak sandwich! Food and service were both excellent! AND the beer was good and cold - bonus!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my experience yesterday!  Being a new restaurant I expected first week bugs.  Customer service is very important to me and today Haymaker missed the mark.    Upon arriving we were greeted and seated quickly.  We were hoping to order breakfast but was told it was no longer an option because they stopped taking orders for breakfast at 11:30 (though it was 11:25 at the time).  Not a problem, their lunch menu looked great.  We waited for 20 minutes for about first contact with one if the wait staff.  We asked for recommendations when we were greeted by the waitress and, with her recommendation, ordered our food and drinks at the same time.   We then proceeded to wait for over an hour food.  About 50 minutes in, we were told that they were sorry for the wait they were having difficulty in the kitchen transitioning from breakfast to lunch.  We politely thank her and recognized that we understood.  About 65 minutes into our wait, our food arrived.  We ordered a French Dip sandwich and their BLAT (bacon, lettuce, avocado & fried tomato).  The French Dip was great, a little soggy but had a great taste.  The BLAT was very dry and lacked taste.  It was not bad enough to not eat but was not very good.    At the end of the meal we asked if there was anything they could do for us for the wait.  The waitress stated that she had already asked the manager and she had said no.  We then asked to talk to the manager and she said that she was sorry and she recognized that we had waited a very long time for our meal.  She stated that they were new and it was the computer/transition to breakfast and there was nothing they could do.  After a few more minutes of conversation, she agreed to comp us one meal.    I first recommend the manager reading the book Fred 2.0.  The customer experience is so important and even having to ask for something to be done due to the long wait fails to meet \"great customer service\".  Being in the service industry myself, I would have comped the meal and given a free return meal so we could prove to the customer how great we normally are.    Unfortunately I will not be returning and will recommend to others to do the same...."}
{"text":"Food here is great. Service as good. It is a drive for us to get there, but worth it. For a sport fanatic, this is the place to be on game day. Many screens everywhere. I understand that this place is locally owned and as such, in my opinion and my opinion only, needs our support and patronage. They certainly have mine."}
{"text":"We love this place! Everything we've tried, from the chicken chili nachos, fish and chips, chicken fried chicken (their cream sauce on it is to die for!) to the burgers, we have liked. My picky kid enjoys the Mac and cheese here. Even brought my parents here when they visited from Kansas, and my father said it was one of the best steaks he's ever had (and we know steaks!) and probably could have cut it with a butter knife...it was that tender. The decor is pure American and the bar is a nice size. Also, they give a military discount not just for active duty, but for veterans too, such as my husband.  This is now our go to place. Service has always been excellent every time. We are looking forward to trying their breakfast some day soon!"}
{"text":"Just happen to stop by last night and glad I did! Happy hour was in full swing with great choices from 5 bucks to 7! Also it was a Pint night with a brewery from Colorado...Upslope, I believe. Manny was my server/ bartender and Travis was the manager in the bar area. I have fried pickles and chicken fried steak was to full for dessert but I saw a bread pudding so I'm coming back for that!!"}
{"text":"Burgers were good and service was great! Went on a Thursday night and expected it to be very busy but it wasn't. Local brews on tap were also decent. Went with a family of four, no desert for @75 bucks. Not bad!"}
{"text":"We are cooks ourselves so we don't eat out often because you just can't find good food. This restaurant is the exception to that rule. Properly prepared food at the correct temperature. The taste and texture of food like this is a pleasure to eat. They didn't skimp on the portion size not too much not too little. The wait staff did a great job of providing quick courteous service. The kitchen also provided prompt service not making you wait for your meal. Even though the store was very busy on a Friday evening the experience was great. We noticed also that the menu choices were not too many enough choices but not so many that the kitchen is overloaded with prep times. It is better to do a few things very well than to fail at many things. If you like food that tastes and looks like it was cooked by professional chefs at a Price that is reasonable give this restaurant a try."}
{"text":"Stopping for breakfast before my  goddaughter fly so if the college. Ordered soft scrambled all American breakfast the waitress said the biscuit was the best I got the water ordered the chicken fried steak with cheesy eggs. My eggs were cold and dry my biscuit was huge dry able to eat it  my goddaughters chicken fried steak was placed on this huge huge biscuit you couldn't even see the eggs because of the size of the biscuit never saw a chicken fried steak put on a 3 inch tall basket. It was ridiculous. I've been there many times at the bar had burgers which was good but the breakfast forget about it don't waste your time"}
{"text":"I just wanted to say something about the claim of food poisoning that I just read.I was certified to train food handlers and to certify them. And to do that I had to spend many weeks in class. Food poisoning does not show until 6 to 8 hours after eating.So a claim of it happening within a few minutes or even a couple of hours is false. This is a fine establishment with fresh meat, never frozen and its ordered in twice weekly.They cook their roast and turkeys in house and they are pretty darn good.I know this because I have eaten in all three of their establishments and make a habit to know something about the product I'm being served. So you all enjoy the good food and great service at the Haymaker, including the newest one on Bell and Tatum."}
{"text":"They need to call it the BIG BISCUIT ,food is great and plenty of it. Met the new manager and have to say its a real pleasure to talk to her. Shes a breath of fresh sir, someone who really makes you feel welcome quite a switch from never seeing mgrs. in the past"}
{"text":"Tried this place several times and they have gone from good to very good. Had the fried fish and the change to a lighter batter works really well.tarter sauce is much improved from last time I tried it which shows they listen to their customers.  Also ordered a salad with it which was nicely chilled and very fresh. The staff was very friendly from the moment I walked in until I left. The manager Tammy is commended for doing an excellent job."}
{"text":"All of their food was really good! We came here for Father's Day because of their gluten free menu. Their gluten free food was delicious, my boyfriend got the steak sandwich on the gluten free bread and it was awesome. Server was great and we had an overall great experience."}
{"text":"Love sitting at the bar at the Haymaker,  Awesome Bartender 1 and 2, aka Jill and Amber.  Best service and no better way to enjoy a Saturday night."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the visit, the food was very good, the service was exceptional. The prices are reasonable, they serve Breakfast all day!!"}
{"text":"I was contacted by Joe and invited to come back and try Haymaker out again.  I received NO freebies or comps, and did not identify myself.    I must admit the crew seemed MUCH more pleasant this time around and our waitress was very helpful and pleasant.  Her name does not appear on our receipt, but she listened to our requests and delivered 100% accurate!  My wife loves the salmon and my son loves the burgers.  I'm still trying out different things.  Thanks for emailing me Joe and thanks for considering my opinion!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today. Service exceeded my expectations for a newly opened restaurant. I had the Texan burger with sweet potato fries. I ordered the burger medium and it did come out well done. It was dry and I did have to order extra Bbq sauce to compensate. I'm thinking maybe it needed lettuce, tomato and mayo to add to it. I'm just not sure, it was a little too basic. I still ate all of it. The sweet potato fries were scrumptious! My mother ordered the salmon plate, the salmon did look a little dry. She claimed the rice and veggies were flavorless but she is a hard cookie to please. The happy hour menu did look intriguing and look forward to coming back to try some of those adult beverages. The manager did come by to ask us how our meal was but I didn't permit my mother to say anything because both of us ate our entire meal and we were time constricted. It would have looked like we were complaining to just complain. I'm sure she would have listened and done something to compensate. I know this is a newly opened restaurant and they have little quirks to work out so I will not write it off. I feel this place deserves 3.5 stars but that is not an option on here. Figured due to the service, I have no problem rounding up.  I really do want to try out one of those chili dogs!"}
{"text":"I don't know much about whiskey but I like what I have had. When I saw a restaurant with such a large whiskey selection, I thought this would be a good place to learn. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. The restaurant looked great and had a great atmosphere. But when I asked our waitress about the whiskey flights she didn't know anything about them, she didn't even know the prices. And she didn't offer to go check. I picked one of the flights at random, just wanting to try something new. When she came back I she told me they were out of them. The same thing happened a little later with my wife's drink. So my wife asked our waitress about the house wine, and she didn't know what they were nor did she offer to check. I picked two more whiskey flights at random, just in case they were out of the second one I picked. When she came back with the flights, she didn't tell me which one was which. I wanted to know so I would know what I liked so that I could order it again.   The food wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. I had the Wrangler Burger which is a pretty standard burger, nothing too fancy. It was pretty bland. I tried putting table salt on it, something I don't usually do, but it didn't help much.   Overall the experience wasn't horrible, but I won't be going back unless I hear it's changed. A couple of things that should be changed are: 1. Train the staff on the menu. Our waitress was nice, but not very knowledgeable. If a restaurant has such a large selection of whiskey, the staff should at least have some knowledge of the ones on the menu and what is available. If the staff is new, they should be shadowing someone until they get the hang of it.  2. Season the food a little better. Both my burger and my wife's bbq beef sandwich were a bit bland."}
{"text":"Bloody Mary's $3...yes please!  French Toast was amazing!  Jill the manager is a saint , crazy complainer about eggs \"under cooked\" (what? ???) and she was super professional.  Love it here! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch 10/17. Not busy at all yet been sitting for almost 10 min and not even greeted by a waiter/waitress.  Expect more from a new restaurant. Don't even care about the food at this point. With service this poor not likely to come back. The food was okay but nothing special.  The cole slaw  was the shredded cabbage mix that can be bought at a grocery store with a watered down bottled standard dressing.  Nothing that we need to have again"}
{"text":"This is a nice local sports bar/restaurant.  My husband had a burger... I had steak salad both were really good.  We like the place"}
{"text":"We've had great results in several visits.  Classic American food and ambience.  My wife has gluten intolerance, and Haymaker accommodates her needs very well."}
{"text":"Ribs were really good, nice and moist, not dry at all. BBQ sauce was good and the ribs had the perfect amount. Mac and cheese was very tasty. And they serve beer in a huge mason jar - nothing better than that! They have a nice selection of craft beers. Going to try breakfast on the weekend next."}
{"text":"Good beer it comes in a jar cute little touch, food was average didn't care for the side of mixed veggies wish I could have an opt. On sides"}
{"text":"Breakfast Breakfast Breakfast!  Its a little shallow in tye pool of the west valley, and this is certainly not Matt's, but its a solid performer on the west side of Phoenix. I especially like the Juevos Benedictos. If you like a Benedict, this one has a perfect egg, a tasty choruzo patty and a chipotle hollondaise with a little kick.   Giving 3 stars because i dont take my breakfast lightly, and once we were turned away because of a mystery issue in the kitchen."}
{"text":"got here Friday night and it was sort of busy, server Nicole was in another section and noticed we still needed drinks, she took great care of us and my wife loves the gluten free bun for the burger which is rare, great experience all the way around, definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The waitstaff was friendly. That's about all that was good. The booth we sat in was torn up and covered with duct tape. The burger was ordered well done was delivered barely medium. I would have had a better meal from McDonald's in the same lot. The other disturbing issue was both my daughter and wife got sick from the food they ate. Within 10 minutes of leaving nausea set in and they were down for about 24 hrs. For the price not at all worth it. It's a nice enough place I hope they can get it together."}
{"text":"Was there other day we enjoyed the fish taco, the burger s were ok, my son asked waiter should he chicken fried steak, or other choice waiter recomended the cfs, oh well he shouldn't  have. Not the classic white sausage gravy. My wife loved the fish and chips."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to visit for breakfast lunch or dinner. It's got a great down home Americana feel with a great selection American beers & whiskey. Is amazing. The staff was great. Our server Rylie was at attentive and the manager Manny was very kind and accommodating. It's obvious this place is running well. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"We joined some friends to try out this new restaurant.  I had the salmon and it was so overcooked it was tough.  The bed of spinach also included TONS of small pieces of garlic, mashed up overcooked tomatoes and onions.  The whole thing was disgusting.  The server never once came back to refill our drinks (soft drinks).  Maybe if we were drinking liquor she would have??  Also, the server never once asked if we liked our meal.  There did not seem to be any manager on duty.  This place is not going to make it with food and service like this."}
{"text":"Have had breakfast twice in last week. Food / servers excellent. Will frequent more often on next visit to town."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Nothing to rave about but it beats any of the local chain restaurants. Apparently, they don't like to serve breakfast since twice they have let my family and I  leave because we have missed their cut off time. The 1st time we arrived at 10:35 am, they stop serving at 10:30 and had already put everything away. TODAY,  my dad went in to get a table as I was getting my baby out of the car and the hostess told my dad they weren't serving breakfast anymore. He asked what time it was and she said it was 10:30. I looked at my phone and it was 10:20! When I went in, I asked what time it was...she said 10:30! I said no it's not! She knew I caught her in a lie and proceeded to say but \"we could still serve you\"!!! Knowing that she had just lied to my dad, I just walked out. We almost stayed since we were pretty hungry and they said they could still serve us but we didn't want any \"special ingredient\" added to our food so we decided to leave. Not cool!"}
{"text":"Our server was awsome. I had my 1yr old daughter with me. And anything i asked for, he was right their. Huge Biscuits and the gravy was the bomb!"}
{"text":"Great home made food with a liquor menu centered around whisky. Awesome establishment. Service was slow with appetizer and entree coming out together. Besides that great dinner can't wait to try the breakfast."}
{"text":"Horrible place to try to have a dinnner. Waited for 20 then sat for another 20. A sure miss. Go to Dillions. Same menu!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I recently visited The Haymaker, and loved it! Everything from our food to our waitress (Leah) were amazing. I had the a special.... something not on the menu called \"pulled pork hash\" and it was amazing!! My wife had the All American breakfast and loved it. We will be back for sure. (3rd visit and nothing to complain about)"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant once and it was a good experience. Their breakfast has large portions. I ordered an omelette dish. It was great. Better than a lot of other breakfast restaurant. I will definitely be going there more."}
{"text":"When first reading about the restaurant we were a little leary and worried. The pictures of the sandwiches really made us wonder about how the quality of food was. I have to admit it really surprised us with the food and beer selection. The amount of craft beer on draft is awesome. Wide selection of different beers to choose from. We started with the mini ribbies were very good; sauce was amazing. We got the grilled bbq chicken and the country fried chicken. Both had great sides and great taste.   My only complaint would be the prices compared to the serving sizes. The 16 oz beers were $6-$7; yes they have a wide selection but they're not rare breweries. And the ribbies; while they were very good....4 small ribs for $9 (as an app!) definitely overpriced. I was expecting 6 small ribs for that price.  The entrees were definitely enough to fill me up (with three beers), the prices again could be lower ($12 and $14).   I have some real hope for Haymaker \"making it\" compared to the other establishments that have been here, but some minor changes will have to be considered so they don't fall into the same pattern."}
{"text":"This place was excellent. High quality, good sized portions & very reasonable prices for what you're getting.  We will be regulars here. Its a must try. Solid kids menu. The texan burger is money. Im stuffed and happy. Plus if you are a bluegreen owner, you can expect a discount with your room key. Kudos!"}
{"text":"The food was way above average.  Chicken steak was super with great gravey and vegies.  I had a pulled pork sandwich which is good as it gets.  Good beer selection on tap for being in AZ and at $3 during happy all you can do is smile and consume a couple."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here when we couldn't find the restaurant we wanted. Breakfast in a bar, surrounded by TV screens. At breakfast, really? Hash browns tasted of old grease, egg Benedict - definitely not hollandaise sauce. My companion's eggs were cold and runny. Sorry - we should have known we were in the wrong place when we walked in. Second star is for service - that was good."}
{"text":"Been there twice in the past month and waited over an hour for food.they need to hire some people that show up or find new management.I will not be returning"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this restaurant however came out extremely disappointed  Food - mac/cheese was hard on top and mushy inside, chili is not chili - it's spaghetti sauce, it's overall food was way below standard  Service - good service, kitchen manager gave us complimentary appetizers for our next visit and took off one of our meals from our cheque  Beer on tap was good - however there is a major issue - in my opinion beer should never be served out of a mason jar!!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and it was a great experience. The food was really good and the service was friendly and prompt. The first thing my wife and I noticed walking in was how clean and comfortable this place is. I will definitely back again for happy hour, lunch, dinner or breakfast."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and I like it.  Nothing spectacular but the feed was good and the beer selection great.  I hope this place survives this location has bad luck."}
{"text":"Steadily a good place to eat and enjoy a drink/beer. The staff is consistently friendly, and I'll definitely go again. I think the prices are a little high though. Like $9 for a BLT, it was a decent BLT, but not for the price."}
{"text":"This was the best find so far since moving to the Valley. Food is always good, the prices are certainly fair and the wait staff is always incredibly friendly. Especially Zack, he's the bomb!.We have quickly become regulars there eating there 2 or 3 times per week."}
{"text":"I knew I was going to love it when I saw the blessing we used to say growing up in reclaimed wood on the wall, larger than life.  The waiter (from Louisiana) was awesome and our food was delicious.  We will be back and are so happy to welcome The Haymaker to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"The hubby and brother-in-law had the steak sandwich and lariat burger with fringles...both said their choices were quite good. My sister and I had French dips. The bread was fresh, the meat was tender, and the Swiss cheese was nicely melted. The au jus, however, was tasteless, tasteless, tasteless. Avoid that meal. Stopped for a chocolate donut on way home. Waitperson was friendly and did not attempt to hurry us out the door."}
{"text":"Was seated in a dirty table. Silverware was dirty. Ordered a medium hamburger to find blood coming out. A very observant server quickly arrived to stop me from another bite. The manager arrived to passionately defend the bloody hamburger as being thoroughly cooked. Will never eat here again. I ate here once a month Prior. Manager needs better social skill. Disappointed!"}
{"text":"I typically visit Peoria a couple times a year, and The Haymaker is one of my favorites.  I have eaten here several times, and tried breakfast, lunches, and dinners, and never have I had a meal that disappointed me.  The food and service has always been par none here.  I would make a recommendation off the menu, but everything I have ever tried here has been very good and at a very reasonable price.  And the service has always been awesome and very friendly.  They have always made me feel like family, even though they don't know me.  I like that."}
{"text":"We have eaten here 7 or 8 times for dinner. We have tried many of the items. I just tried the Joey's Primavera Pasta and loved it. The Caesar Salad was very crisp and delicious, a bit heavy on the dressing, but my hubby likes it that way. :-) My favorite dinner here is the Ribs! so tender and the sauce is amazing! Mac and cheese is pretty awesome too. I like the coleslaw and steamed vegies. Fish and chips are wonderfully crunchy and fresh.After  this many visits, we've only had one bad server. Normally they are right on. Also a good selection of BEER.  We need to try the breakfast and lunch menu now. Try it you'll like it. Good ol' Merican fare!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! I had a Texan burger with Cajun fries and my husband had the jumbo bbq sandwich-- both were amazing!!!! The Cajun fries were spicy and so good! This was our first time here but will defiantly be on the list of our favorite places!"}
{"text":"Called to make a reservation because Yelp said they took them and they don't- just an FYI.... Wish they took them, was the reason why we had decided to try this location out."}
{"text":"Just had the St Louis ribs. Excellent.  Ribs were moist, tender and very meaty. Margaritas are excellent.  Wait time for drinks was a little too long, but the quality made it worth waiting for. Great place."}
{"text":"So I decided to try this place out for dinner after a friend recommended it, 1st off I'd like to say I was very impressed, they have the pledge of allegiance on the wall with the declaration of independence proudly hanging on up, in the a time where ppl are easily offend by everything it's good to see a place where they have pride in things like that, second the food was amazing, I had the Country fried steak and my friend had the fried chicken we both loved it, the gravy on both were amazing, the one on the chicken kind of had a nacho cheese taste and the one on my had a biscuits and gravy taste to it, really good, I'm a whiskey girl and seeing the huge list of items they carry made me happy, I know where I'll be coming back to for some drinks, the service was very friendly, I think our waitress was named Courtney, had the manager check to make sure we were doing ok, I wanted to try out the dessert but we were too full, maybe next time, definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, bland food, overpriced! Came for lunch with our kids and they got their food first- usually nice to keep them occupied but not if you have to wait an additional 20 minutes to get your meals! The kids were done eating, getting restless, and the tables sat after us already got their food. Our waiter was unapologetic, stating it takes longer for grilled chicken??? Apparently it takes 30+ minutes to make a grilled chicken sandwich here. By the time our food came out the kids didn't want to be there anymore (couldn't blame them, neither did I). We asked for everything to go. No compensation for anything offered. Will not return.   When we got home, everything was over cooked!!"}
{"text":"Great food for the NW Valley and awesome happy hour deals!  Plus good service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I had the BBQ beef sandwich. It was excellent.  Great food, fair prices, wonderful hostess and plenty of TV's! I would eat here regularly if I was a resident! Will stop in next time. #haymaker"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great breakfast! Finally Goodyear has a fantastic breakfast restaurant with an awesome menu. The flavors and portions were five star. The owners were very warm and welcoming. Thank you Haymaker Restaurant for a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"My family and I ate breakfast. My boys and I got pancakes. They were ok. The coffee is what made me give it a third star."}
{"text":"Update: so, when I posted the review, the owner messaged me and apologized that I had a bad time at his restaurant, which I think is really cool. I promised to try their breakfast, which is their specialty. I tried it the other day and it's very good! I had the country fried steak, and a friend had their eggs Benedict. Both were really good. As usual, the service was great. The country fried steak was huge and sitting on the biggest biscuit I have ever seen (interestingly, it was better than the biscuits at Biscuits cafe). Seriously, that fucker was the size of a VHS tape. The eggs are served however you want, and note to the cook, scrambled with cheese does not mean make scrambled eggs and put cold cheese on top when plating, but they were down a cook and busy, so I don't blame them, I doubt it was on purpose. All in all, as a relatively picky customer, I'd say they're pretty good. If red robin is a 2, this place is a 4 at a similar price."}
{"text":"Bottom line: this place has excellent food and service to boot. You can't go wrong at the Haymaker."}
{"text":"After all the wonderful reviews we drove 30 minutes out of the way to try this place. We were disappointed to say the least. There were 4 in our party, 2 adults and 2 children. One of the adult meals and one of the children's meals were inedible. The service was poor. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars was because their happy hour was pretty good."}
{"text":"Service was good. Breakfast was to much and under cook. The pancakes, are huge but not cooked throughout. Taste gummy! Nice restaurant but will not eat there again."}
{"text":"Go for the Texan burger and the sweet potato fries, they are awesome!  There is not much I would suggest to improve.  The service was great, the beer was cold and they have a great whiskey selection.  I really like this place and wish I would have known about it earlier.  Because of the name, I thought it was a restaurant supply company. Would love to see live music at some point so I can make this my weekly hang out."}
{"text":"Wonderful spicy silky sauce on juevos rancheros benedictos. Big breakfast. Will have to try lunch items. Very good service"}
{"text":"Great service!!  Great food!!  Very patriotic atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"I've been back several times with different family members and it continues to be a great experience. Service is always good and the food always comes out hot and taste so FRESH unlike a lot of big commercial restaurants. We try to order something different every time. So far have had the Arizona Burger, Arizona Grilled Chicken, Patty Melt (Maybe my favorite thing so far), TAB Sandwich, Gringo Burger, Primavera pasta, Salmon, Side salad is pretty big portion. This place continues to impress and the quality of food never fails. The large drink selections are awesome and the variety is great! Never seen a 'racist' thing in the place, just very patriotic and small town feel. Will continue to make this our go to spoke in our neighborhood. Will also make it a goal to check out the breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Love the hometown feel. Servers are always friendly. Giving 4 stars because food is good but not amazing."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant. We are regulars and every Saturday morning we come in for their delicious breakfast. The staff are so friendly and personable we consider them friends. Not only that, the breakfast menu is amazeballs and not just cookie cutter franchise crap, really amazing bacon and the Dutch Apple French Toast is to die for!!"}
{"text":"Brought the family to AZ for vacation. Saw this place when we were driving by. The Bloody Mary was one of the best I've ever had. I had the bandit, which I would highly recommend. Service was great, it was reasonably priced, and the atmosphere was very patriotic (big plus). I will come back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Pros: Restaurant was very clean and our server was top notch.  Cons: In our party of 4 three of us ordered the country fried chicken. It seemed like it was from a school lunch room. The gravy was bland and the pieces of corn and other vegetables in it made it look very unappetizing. The chicken was cooked fine but the whole thing was bland and reminded us of a frozen dinner. The side veggies were fine though. The other person in our party had country fried steak which had the same \"gravy\". I don't know what cut of beef it was but he couldn't get through a quarter of it. The staff was very friendly but we won't be going back again."}
{"text":"The Good: Excellent, helpful, very friendly employees. Best bread pudding I have ever eaten (and I have had it at many, many restaurants). I had the Chili, which was thick and tasted like it was made from scratch (not a can). Highly recommended. Also had the pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw, which was also very tasty. I would order the same things again. We plan to return.  The Bad:  Restaurant ambiance is a mix of sports bar and Denny's. Clean, but seemed a little run-down and in need of some sprucing up. Pretty dark (but sort of a default in AZ). If you are not a fan of TVs with sports in every corner, this may not be your place."}
{"text":"This place exceeded our expectations! Our family was dealing with some stressful issues today and we saw a Facebook recommendation by one of the servers named, Erin. She said the offered a 20% military discount and kids under 10 eat free with paid adult on wednesday. So we thought \"sounds great!\". I can't say enough great things about this return until. Our server, Linda, went out of her 2ay to be generous and courteous, not only with my husband and I but with our children as well. The team manager came to our table to be sure our service was on point and thanked by husband repeatedly for his military service.   And the food! Come on it all comes down to the food right? It was incredible. And we have tried many places in this area only to be disappointed by so-so meals. The food here was phenomenol. We started with the chili cheese fries, first impression and we fell in love. I opted for the Arizona burger with a substitution chicken breast and it 2as out of this world. The whole roasted green chile's really helped me get back in touch with my inner New Mexican :)   But seriously. Go. Try it. You won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Went with my daughter and her two babies, 20 months and 6 months, they said it would be a 20 minute wait, but it only ended up being 5 minutes. It wasn't very crowded, but it took her awhile to get over to our table to get our drink order, we told her we were ready to order she said she'd be back to take your order. When she finally, came back to place our order, we asked her if we could have a cup of fruit out first for the 20 month old. After 45 minutes of waiting for our food, I went to look for the manager, but the hostess told me that she was in the back preparing food. I asked if she could pack up our food to go, since we have somewhere to be in 10 minutes, she said she would let the manager know. After 10 more minutes of waiting, our food finally got to the table, and it was cold. I asked the server if she could please bring us to go boxes since we needed to leave. Never once did we get refills on our drinks while we were sitting there waiting for almost an hour."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at the Haymaker.  Fernando greeted us with a smile. Big seafood fan. Christian recommended the blackened catfish tacos. Delicious! The manager Austin brought out our dessert . Service was outstanding. Highly recommend the Haymaker."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! How did I not know about this place?  Will definitely be back.  Our waitress Andrea (sara) was amazing!"}
{"text":"A while back I tried the fish chips. Nothing really to brag about. They lacked seasoning of any kind and I wasn't too impressed. Therefore, when my family suggested we do a sibling brunch there I wasn't too excited. However, I ordered the eggs Benedict and it was outstanding! A large portion with quality ingredients! Guess I will have to give dinner another shot!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here regularly for the past couple of months. The people are friendly, the food is good and I can always catch a good baseball game. Sal at the bar is incredible. He always takes good care of me and has my drink waiting when he sees me walk in. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for good food, good beer and a fun environment."}
{"text":"Lukewarm on this place at first, but it has gotten better and has become one of our most frequent stops. It's really four-and-a-half stars but I'm rounding up. Food is consistently good, and we have tried many things on the menu. Terrific happy hour specials. Great wings and fried pickles, sliders are great, good (not great) burgers, good fries and rings. Love the country fried chicken, blackened salmon, french dip, Reuben, and the pig wings are a treat!  Kathy the bartender is the best and we try to come on the days we know she is there. My wife loves \"Martini Mondays\" because Kathy makes them so great. We came in on a Monday recently and Kathy wasn't there so we almost left - but we stayed for the food."}
{"text":"This place is right down the street from my house. The food is okay but the service is extremely slow. My wife and I went in for lunch sat in the bar area, at least 3 servers walked past us. After 20 min. without even being acknowledged we left. Another time we ordered wings we only like the wingetts when we asked for all wingetts we were told no each order comes with 4 drums and 4 wingetts. If i am the person paying for the wings I should be able to get the kind I like."}
{"text":"We came back tonight to try again. We were greeted at door & seated promptly. The server took our drink order right away. She came back to take our order. We started out with the wings which came out in no time. Then we ordered the fish & chips We just finished the wings & our dinner was served. Our drinks were refilled throughout. When we went to pay the bill, Dan came over & introduced himself. He profoundly apologized for the slow service on our 1st visit. So with that said. Our meal & service were GREAT tonight. The food was served hot & both the wings & fish & chips were delicious. The service was outstanding.  THANK YOU Dan. Yes. we will be back."}
{"text":"Nikki was the best, sweetest, most efficient bartender I have ever had. Not only did she make me feel welcome, I noticed her greeting regulars by name and already knowing their drink orders as well as their food orders. She was running the bar as well as all the tables I could see on the floor without missing a beat. Additionally the restaurant was having some difficulties with their refrigeration system, and their beers, but Nikki handled it with such savoir faire that it almost seemed like a cute perk instead of a problem. I want to hire her to work in my restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is close to me and my family and I like to try new places. This place was great. The food was very good and the staff was fast and friendly. We visited for dinner the first time and have also visited many times for breakfast. I'm giving it 4 stars as I think the prices are a tad high for the menu offered but this place really is great. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Several restaurants have failed at this location, but Haymaker has knocked it out of the park here! Been back several times. Burgers are the best and fish fry dinner is awesome, ribs are tender with a slight smokey flavor, not to mention the fried pickles and wings on happy hour.  Best in the area!  I recommend trying the Mac and Cheese for a side with any of the dinners. Friendly staff and attentive bartenders round out a great dining experience and very reasonable prices.  It's hard to pick what to try next!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try for second time.  We will never know if it would have been better than the first visit.  My wife and I had tried this place a couple months after it opened and it was awful.  Cold fries and condiments left off of sandwiches, watered down ranch dressing for the sysco zucchini.  Now we figured it may be worth another shot.  Walked in the door to not be greeted by the two young ladies at the counter who seemed more interested in whatever else.  We turned around and walked out.  Good luck, we won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is real cool. I hardly go out to eat but I stopped by after work one day since I work close by and was surprised. Good prices good food and the people that work there are all really nice ( yes even the feisty Kelsey). Quick refills and food brought out fast even when busy. The fish tacos are amazing, western burger is great. Great place to get some food, few drinks and watch the game. I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"With the limited selection of actual sit-down restaurants around this area, I was just happy to have another option to choose. However, after our first trip for lunch, not only is it just another option, but one that we plan to visit often.   The area is pretty spacious with a cool bar area. There are plenty of TVs around the entire restaurant, although not as many as Lakeside Bar and Grill across the street, but there's always a TV that's easy to see.   The menu is American traditional, but there are some very appetizing variations to it. I tried the Gringo burger, which was cooked perfectly at around medium-medium well. The burger was juicy and the pepper jack, avocado (3 generous slices), and salsa was a nice combination. The bun it came on was delicious, lightly toasted and a little buttery. The French fries had the perfect crisp.   My wife had the steak sandwich, which she was so kind to let me try. The steak was tender, and the feta crumbles were a nice touch.   The service was great. Jen, our waitress, checked in on us often and kept us updated about our food. Assuming because it just opened and to drive customers to the place, she shared the breakfast menu with us. We looked it over, and it looked delicious. Well played, Jen. We'll be in for breakfast :)"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast!!! Huge portions to satisfy those with hardy appetites. I'm not usually a fan of eggs, but their breakfast sandwich had the fluffiest eggs ever on buttery Texas toast. Fantastic. I would've given this joint 5-stars, but their lunch/dinner fell short. Fish n chips are more batter than fish. They skimp on the protein in salads and I'll pass on their frozen seasoned veggies."}
{"text":"First,the food was amazing. I had the pulled pork sandwich and my friend had the steak sandwich.. The staff were courteous and friendly when asked about the menu.Sal in particular was so helpful and pleasant.He is a great asset to your restaurant.we definitely will be coming back for the great food and the great service!"}
{"text":"Went last night 9/27 with some friends. We have been to this restaurant several time before all having a pleasant experience. But last night was the worst service ever at a restaurant. The male server refused to serve us! We had to ask for drinks, ask to take our order, ask for refills, ask for our bill, it was as if he wanted nothing to do with us! Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Food is really good. However, service is average. They typical have very inexperienced hostesses that struggle with sitting patrons in a simple/organized manner.   They really need supervision up front.   Would love to give more stars based on food quality."}
{"text":"Poor service and the food was not any better super slow, had to wait for forever for coffee  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Always love coming to the haymaker in Goodyear...the staff is always friendly and the managers, Liz, Ron, and Travis always go out of their way to make me happy and welcome. Will return at least twice a week! Biscuits and gravy are amazing!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, rude waitstaff,.  They don't seem to care and so we left after being ignored for 15 minutes.  They don't seem to have enough help and the ones they do have are snotty teenagers.  Never again."}
{"text":"Great food and not too hard on the wallet I've only gone there for lunch a few times it is near my work so it's convenient but it also turns out it's pretty good maybe one of these days I'll go have a beer over there after work but I definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Sat down didn't get greeted didn't wipe the bar down in front of us didn't acknowledge us for 5 to 10 minutes. Walked out"}
{"text":"I have been here before, once with my mother, came again since I enjoyed the food. However the second time I went there we were sat and then were not greeted by a server. I had to ask the hostess to grab a sever probably sat there for 15 minutes. Once she got there she was nice. However she forgot an appetizer that we had asked for. Not sure if she was just busy or what. Probably won't come back again. Didn't even have a manager come talk to us about the wait."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  Service is great food is fabulous. You have got to try the chicken fried steak and country gravy. Be sure to ask for extra gravy as the giant biscuit needs about a pint of the stuff. The interior is all American. These folks love our country and what we stand for. I eat here three times a month or more."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here on 3-8-14 and from the minute we came in until we left it was excellent! The service was first class and the restaurant is clean and friendly. We had the biscuits and gravy and they are awesome! Service and food came very quick and it was a full service!  Can't wait to eat dinner here! Oh and groupon was a great purchase for this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Good food.  Fish and chips was great.  Steak was not as good.  Bread pudding was amazing."}
{"text":"This was our first place to eat in Arizona and we fell in love! Its such a warm welcoming place with great staff and amazing food! We'll be back again before we fly back home so we can enjoy happy hour as well!"}
{"text":"Was here on Saturday morning, sat at bar and had sean for a bartender! He was amazing! His knowledge of whiskey is unbelievable! Loved him! Food was awesome too! Will come back to see Sean next Saturday!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Haymakers with our son and his aunt and cousin when they were in town. Reviews were mixed. We decided to go out for breakfast this morning and thought we would give they're breakfast a try. We walked in to a less than enthusiastic welcome and were seated. As we sat there, looking at the menu, we watched servers walking around  taking orders at tables around us, helping customers out on the patio, but none even came near us. We decided what we wanted and were trying to keep our two and a half year old son occupied, still waiting for our server. No one came to take our drinks order, to welcome us, no server ever came to our table. We were there for 15, 20 minutes and no one ever came to our table. We sat there as people who came in after us were attended to. We eventually just got up and walked out. As we did, the same barely concious hostess who sat us, thanked us for coming, barely looking up from her napkin folding. I said as we left, \"we were never served\". Blank stare. You may ask, why not ask for the manager? Because my son was hungry and I didn't want any retribution in my food, if you get my meaning. We went to Denny's, got my son the blueberry pancakes he was crying for when we left Haymakers. I obviously would not recommend!"}
{"text":"We usually come here to eat when my family wants to get together. It's mutal ground for all of us. However the last time we did get together everything was awful. The food was cold, like they just let it sit under the heat lamps forever. The food didn't even taste right. We all got hamburgers, not much you can do to screw that up. 3 of us ended up getting sick that night. They have gone down hill big time. They use to be great but not so much anymore. The last time we went, we went to watch the Cardinals and Green Bay play. My friend order a lemon drop Martini, first off it didn't even taste like one tasted like suger water, also there was a hair in it as well. We sent it back. The bartenders started arguing behind the bar and fighting about it. It's just gone down hill in more ways than 1. We have not been back since and have no intentions of ever going back."}
{"text":"Awesome little spot. Great alternative to Lake Side Bar and Grill. Even when the wait seems long, they are efficient in their turn around. Their bar tenders are always on point and make solid drinks. Their menu is a bit on the short side hence 4 stars. For what they do have, it's always good no matter your choice. Try the salmon for dinner.. My favorite."}
{"text":"The customer service is abysmal.  Drinks didn't come for 15 minutes.  Brought wrong entree and forgot another.  Asked for check...took another 15 minutes.  Don't waste your time.  This is a big miss."}
{"text":"We have always had great friendly service here... We love the breakfast and often come in for lunch & dinner as well. We very often see both the General Manager and the Kitchen Manger out checking on things. Very nice to see. Everyone is always friendly and efficient. The food is always top notch for a price related of this and very clean place as well.   When we sit at the bar we usually have Micaela as our bartender. She's also very fast, efficient, and courteous. Very knowledgeable on their beer selections and the menu.   We will definitely be back and spread the word..."}
{"text":"We love the place!!! My favorite burger is the Cardiologist, piled high with 4 pieces of Bacon and a BUNCH of Pastrami on a Pretzel bun... my wife is a big fan of the Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato and Avocado (BLTA) sandwich. If you like things sweet and spicy order a side of the Pineapple Habanero sauce. Another favorite is the French Dip sandwich and don't forget kids under ten eat free with a paid adult entree on Wednesday and Sundays. Ask for Elizabeth, always friendly service!"}
{"text":"Not the greatest food, service was average. I probably won't be going back again. Took the whole fam, I don't think anyone really enjoyed it that much. Food was super bland, no one wanted to stay for dessert."}
{"text":"Would not recommend the bfast burritos - they don't mix the ingredients well, however, the dinner salmon is fantastic.  the haymaker benedict is pretty good; very filling but takes awhile. The meals always seem to take a bit more time then you think they should. Also bloody mary was not fantastic. no garnish, no horseradish just a lot of Tabasco. Overall though the food was relatively good and the staff were friendly. Seemed clean so we will go again."}
{"text":"Last week, having missed dinner, my out-of-town guest and I stopped by for a late bite and drink.  Wow!  How do I put into a few words the delightful evening we found at the Haymaker?  We enjoyed sitting in the lounge, where we were well-cared for by each member of the team, especially the bartender, Kathleen (from NY, as my guest was).  We felt so at home... we split a BBQ Chicken Salad backed up with  lots of Starters (Mini Ribs, Pineapple Habanera Wings, and Fried Zucchini), and excellent whiskey choices.  Each bite was more delicious than the last; it was hard to stop.  But best of all, was walking into a restaurant that was new to me and finding such amazing service, care and concern by each person on the staff.  It was like stopping by a friend's home.  The owners and management team are to be highly commended for creating this welcoming atmosphere.  I'll be back soon... whether I have guests or not, knowing that I'll be treated like the friend I've become."}
{"text":"Food was just average, this is a burger & basic American food establishment, nothing sets it apart from any other place that serves this type of food.  I ordered a Bufflo Chicken sandwich, the lettuce, tomato & blue cheese are suppose to come on the side.  I told the waitress no tomato and that I would like my French fries well done/crispy.  The sandwich came out with the lettuce on it and no blue cheese at all. The French fries were 1/2 a step fm being cold, she could tell I was looking at them so she asked if they were crispy enough.  I told her no and that they were basically cold.  She went and got a plate then scooped the fries off of my plate with her hands.  About 3 min later she brought out albino looking but hot fries, I decided hot fries would have to do since she wasn't paying attention to what I wanted."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! The breakfast is amazing! The Arizona omelet with chorizo is something you should try!"}
{"text":"Service was ok. Food was decent, could be better. However, prices are more than reasonable, with nice size portions. We'll be back and try it again..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and good food and beer. Love the College Street Big Blue Van American wheat beer from Lake Havasu City, AZ. They have other solid local brews as well. This is one of my routine hangouts when I just want to grab an appetizer and brews with a friend."}
{"text":"Was craving BBQ so I decided to give it a try. Nikki provided exceptional service and gave me samples of their local beers. BBQ beef sandwich was excellent!"}
{"text":"The Haymaker is our spot for eggs benedict close to home.  Their Bloody Marys are on point, too. The food is always tasty.  However, service can sometimes drag.  Overall its a good place for breakfast."}
{"text":"My wife and I come here occasionally. Every time we come the service has been so-so.  Some of the prices are high as well. A chili dog for $10. Maybe, if it were the best ever, but it's average as well.  I always like to try because I hope it'll be better every time, but I'm usually disappointed. Will I come back, maybe, but it will be a while."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Came in for breakfast on the weekend. Two hours later we received our food and we could tell most of it had been sitting under the warmer for a while. I wouldn't waste my time and come back."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time yesterday. .. will definitely be returning! Myself and a few friends decided to go out for lunch and we were all very happy with the food and the service! I like that they serve a breakfast menu throughout the day as well. Some of us got breakfast and some of us got lunch. I happened to get their burger special of the month which was called the Kona burger! SO GOOD! Perfectly cooked! I am planning on going back soon because after seeing how good my friends breakfast looked, I want to try breakfast as well. Our server was very attentive,  friendly and helpful. It was busy when we came in yesterday but that had no impact on our service whatsoever. Great job!"}
{"text":"The reason they don't get one star, is because we switched waitresses and she was nice . The guy \"Ryan\" that took our order was rude wasn't polite and didn't explain the lunch menu for us...horrible service on his end! co workers were not pleased on our lunch today, sorry to the rest of the Haymaker team !"}
{"text":"1st time here. Not impressed.service was slow, food was just ok. Had a t.a.b. and a gringo with chicken breast. Only 4 onion rings in a side.  read good reviews but not too great. Wanted to try breakfast but we were late."}
{"text":"Was very pleased. First time here but the service was good and fast and food was excellent. The \"burger of the month\" had bacon and egg on it and was awesome. Very large whiskey selection. My brother accidentally spilled his drink but it was cleaned up very fast.   Overall good place and I'll be going back!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now. First time was for lunch. I thought the burgers were great and my wife thought the BLAT wasn't the best. Fringes were good and service was acceptable.  The second time we dropped in for breakfast, and this time I have more mixed feelings. We ordered pancakes for the baby, and they were super tough while slightly undercooked. I had the country fried steak, which was a great dish, just super salty. I'm not sure if that was intentional or not. My wife had a bacon & sausage omelette and she said it was great but to me it looked dry and over cooked. The service wasn't all that great this time around either. The f the hour that we were there, my coffee cup was empty for probably 40 minutes.  We will give it another try and see how it goes next time we are in the area and hungry."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, service and wait staff. Good was delicious, great variety, and was prepared quickly. Godly owner isn't afraid to decorate in American values and traditions-prayer AND Pledge of Allegiance on the wall, and an extremely generous 20% Military discount. God bless the owners and staff. We will be back every time we come through Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here frequently as it is local to us. We typically sit at the bar where we can socialize. The staff is always nice, the whiskey is fine (flights are fun/interesting), and the burgers are amazing. I'm a vegetarian and this is my favorite place to go for a burger."}
{"text":"Awesome food!!! You can't go wrong with any of it. The staff are very friendly, great with kids and will never let your drink be low. Always on top of things.... The manager is great and is always getting and talking with guests. The bar tender is great too. She can multi-task filling bar orders and serving his restaurant guests too."}
{"text":"My overall experience was mediocre. The food was delicious and great portion size for the price. Best time to come us during happy hour 2-6pm. My main problem was the service, it wasn't that great. Had to wave down the hostess to get a box and I have waited forever, still no refill on my water. I may or may not come again. They are not busy, so the service should be good. I've seen plenty just walking aimlessly watching tv.  So 2 stars for food -3 for service."}
{"text":"I think this place will quickly become one of my favs. The atmosphere  is nice and patriotic decor is nice. I will say that they had an issue with their kitchen and the food came out cold, that's why I will only give this place 3 stars. I also think the manager should be more present instead of sending the waitress over to apologize for the cold food."}
{"text":"We read about the great breakfast and had a discount offered by the resort we stayed at about a mile away.   It took a minute before anyone came to seat us because there was no one at the front. That was only a minor hiccup because breakfast was awesome! Sad part is I didn't get a pic!  Our waitress, Miranda, was super nice and very attentive. We had our 17 month old grandson who was a little fussy because he was hungry. She brought out his choc chip pancakes quickly. The 4 adults each had something different. The biscuits were huge! The gravy was great. The breakfast sandwich was a winner and my Haymaker Benedict with a chipotle cream sauce was the best!!   Did I mention Miranda is the bomb??!!   Next time we hit Spring Training we will be back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and have been either unimpressed or flat out disappointed. Today we came for breakfast and the honeydew  was seriously verging on being rotten (it was turning gray!), the bacon and potatoes were extremely salty, my daughter sausage was burnt, and my husband who has a dairy allergy ordered a burrito with no cheese and yet it still came with cheese. The only redeeming qualities are the location and the atmosphere. No plans to return."}
{"text":"Well been here for 20minutes and no waitress yet...at first glance there are 25 tables sat with 2 servers...hoping the food makes up for the wait :-)"}
{"text":"First time here,  Very impressive..Daughter is a \"gluten free \"  person and their gluten free menue was outstanding  Service great not just good   Food  , better than most , we had 2 different hamburgers zand a soup and salad  One gluten free.. Nice crispy fries.  So yes we were impressed and will be back."}
{"text":"Besides the food not really having much tasty flavor, (I got the chicken fried steak and eggs) the service was bad. We shad four people already at a table when my girlfriend and I got there. When we came in we sat there for 5 minutes until I had to ask the hostess if we had a server and could get a drink. He went and got the server. She took drink order and then disappeared. Once the drinks came out she wasnt seen for a while until we had to ask another server if we could put our order in. Order was placed and food came out. Server was hardly around for refills and never asked how our food was.   At the end I expressed how unsatisfied I was with the service and directed it solely towards the server. Once the server walked into the back the manager then came out and asked us what happened. We explained the bad service and she had an attitude. My sister explained it and I said I would do a yelp review. The manager then said we were immature and we \"shouldn't always expect great service\"  Besides the food not being tasty, the slow service and watching other tables come in and get served, the rudeness of the manager will keep me from going back and I will not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Hubby treated me to brunch for my birthday, we loved this place from the moment we stepped in.  They are very patriotic and have a large whiskey bar.  Breakfast was well made and we were waited on quickly.  I had the huevos rancheros and a mimosa, everything was delicious.  We will be back to try the dinner service and sample the whiskey bar sometime."}
{"text":"Great place to go have a drink and get some good food. Lariat burger or hot pastrami is the best."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome I love the decor! Food is great, Jill the Bartender is AMAZING! She really knows her whiskey. Everyone should come try this fine establishment!"}
{"text":"My husband and I loved this restaurant. We saw the pictures here on yelp and decided to give it a try. He said the chile burger could have been spicier. I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was melt in your mouth amazing. The homemade BBQ sauce did not disappoint. One thing that I loved about the restaurant was the staff. Our waiter was extremely personable and attentive to requests for my BBQ sauce and soda refills. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!!! GREAT service and absolutely fantastic food. Come here for breakfast! The Haymaker Benedict will rock your world!!  At my last visit, a deaf couple sat down at the table next to me, trying to mime and point at the menu. The lovely bartender ran over and signed with them and made them laugh. I watched her change their ordering experience from what their daily struggles are usually, to a happy and friendly conversation. They clearly looked at ease and so comfortable being able to converse with their server. It was beautiful to watch.  Go here, make it your regular spot, you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I frequent The Haymaker about once a month for breakfast.  The food is good and the service has always been good.  My only complaint is the excuse of a biscuit....  I know it is cheaper and less time consuming to make biscuits on a baking tray, but come on....!  They would get five stars,could charge another $.50/breakfast, and get clients back more often, if they did real biscuits."}
{"text":"My family and I have lived just down the street from the Haymaker, I didn't even notice that it opened until I drove right next to it, and noticed cars parked all around it.  Feeling kinda adventurous, I walked in and was immediately greeted by a friendly hostess, I explained that I live near by, and just wanted to see for myself what things looked like.  I ordered some wings to go, just to have a look see at how they were.  Wings are one of those things that seem easy to do, but often are served like chew toys for a dog.   I got home turned on the TV and grabbed a cold one to enjoy the wings with, I was blown away!!!  The wings were awesome, tender, tasty and served with a unique seasoning that I have never had before, the Haymaker was off to a great start. Since then, this place has become my go to carry out restaurant!  My family and I have practically had every item on the menu, awesome!!! Reasonably priced, consistently good!!!  My recommendation is give this place a try, you will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I went to the Haymaker for the first time the other night and had a satisfactory experience. Our waiter was outgoing and friendly however, service was painfully slow. My drink got completely empty three times with our server no where in sight. I ordered a certain side and instead got something completely different."}
{"text":"No different from previous owner.  Bar is boring, and bartenders have no workable bar skills.  Go somewhere else for a cocktail.  I didn't try the food, but service staff surely did not try to recommend any food."}
{"text":"I always love the food even if it's slightly inconsistent.  The salads are large but a little pricey. The one hamburger I loved they took off the menu. I wish the kitchen took as much time and was as attentive as the front of the house.  The bartenders are always helpful and so friendly. I often bring my dog and sit on the patio which is hard to find a place that allows this! No one acts annoyed or seems irritated to help. They have a monthly whisky if you have the app. (For a dollar, small shot) I always like to try new things. They also open early for breakfast and have had a summer menu offering some fun options and mixes. Happy hour is alright with a few small bites. Features Mason jar cocktails ( about 6-7 dollars) and Jack Daniels and Jim Beam drinks for under five dollars. (Beer too) I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It's a cool looking place, friendly staff. Seems nice. I had the jumbo bbq beef sandwich. It was just roast beef with bbq sauce. The sauce was really good but the roast beef was not. This is not real bbq. They try and advertise they have good bbq but it's not the real kind. It was fine just not what I was wanting. Good drinks too. Had the Lynchburg lemonade. Very delicious."}
{"text":"So we have tried this place three times now and I have to say this is one of my favorite places to go! The piggy platter and fish and chips are two of my favorites! They had free burgers for the vets on Memorial Day. The staff I can't say is super fast but they all have great team work and someone will always come by to make sure you don't need anything. We will continue to come back for the great food and friendly service! I love this place"}
{"text":"The first time here and we will definitely be back. The food was so good. I had the French dip with fries. The sandwich was oases with tender beef, grilled onion and mushrooms. The fries were crispy but tender on the inside. My husband had the blackened catfish with rice and veggies. He said his food was excellent too. Then he helped me finish mine because the meal was so huge. The service was great too. Heather is one of the best waitresses."}
{"text":"We usually go to Haymaker in Peoria but decided to try the one in Goodyear for a change.  Upon opening the door we entered an entryway that was scented and and problematic to people like me who are allergic to scented air fresheners.  When I used the bathroom I was greeted with 2 wide open glade air fresheners in a heavily scented space.  This was offensive and makes me wonder what is being masked.  No air fresheners are needed in a clean bathroom and it makes breathing easier.  The food was good but the Mac and cheese was not as expected, orange and greasy answer not like the yummy one in the Peoria location.  We had recommended the Mac and cheese to the 2 other couples that were with us and it was a huge disappointment.  Consistency of recipes at the different locations is important to customers including us."}
{"text":"A  over priced place to eat with lousy service.. waitress chatting with friends about drinking all night long.. no drink refills. . Veggies were cold.. meat over done.. no plans on returning"}
{"text":"Not a great first impression. Waited 10 minutes for a server to even come by, Tried ordering apps but they were out of a couple of them (this was early too like 5:00).  Ordered food  took a while (Place was not that crowded - it was midweek)  Wrong food showed up (Table behind us and next too us also sent food back).  Took almost 30 minutes for us to get check and get out the door once we asked for check.  Buffalo Chx Sandwich was nothing Exciting, Kids mean was just that a Box of Kraft (though a small serving).  Had a Groupon so did not cost a fortune but not real excited to go back - better happy hour deals available within a couple miles"}
{"text":"Makes a great neighborhood restaurant.  we frequent it often.  Relaxing bar and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Service was great both times. The food delivery was slightly slower the second time but the food was excellent. First time we had salads. The BBQ chicken salad and the Steak salad.....both great. The second time my daughter had the Texan Burger and the soup of the day which was the loaded baked potato soup which was not too salty like so many others she had tried in the past. She really liked it and it had a lot of flavor. My wife had the BLAT sandwich which she said was good and interesting but she wouldn't rave about it. I had the piggy wings  with orange marmalade. It was excellent and it was perfect blend of flavors; the meat was tender; and went really well with the Devils Ale. Overall we like the place! We will be back!  ."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place for lunch with friends. The service was good and friendly. I was in the mood for a burger so I went with the Lariat with Cajun fries. It was very good! The portion sizes are more than enough and the Cajun fries are the best! The meat was cooked perfectly; and any burger that has bacon in it is a win :)! I did also sample the Mac n cheese and that was pretty good also. I wish I would've saved room for dessert because they sounded great but I guess I'll leave that for the next time around. I would recommend the burgers and Cajun fries!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for 15 minutes before bartender showed up then he took our drink order and disappeared for another 15 minutes. We walked out. Prices are way high"}
{"text":"Good local bar.  Cold domestic and craft brew on tap served in a mason jar.  The Bleu Burger and wings were tasty.  Next time I swing by it will be for breakfast."}
{"text":"Not great. Pretty bland. Food was cold. Hardly anyone here. I'd probably give it another try, but the prices were a bit high for so little flavor."}
{"text":"So the Haymaker is very close to where I live and when we moved here we ate there a lot. Food has been pretty good. I love there hamburgers and rythem hot wings. They have a pretty good happy hour too. The one thing that drives me crazy is their salads. First time I had a salad. It was not good. No flavor, not enough chicken and very small. Their salads are $12. For the price, I should have requested a refund. So, I haven't tried another one until last week. Ordered the BBQ Chicken salad. Big mistake, it has not improved. Please revamp your salad menu. For what they charge, this salad should be huge and good. My husband had the buffalo chicken salad, it was not good either. Do not order their salads."}
{"text":"Had great service from Amber at the bar! Salad was a good size portion and tasted great! Clean place and friendly staff."}
{"text":"First time here, don't know why I never tried this place before but I will be back. Service was great (Thanks Danielle) had the French dip due to Danielle's suggestion, great sandwich. My wife had the Texan burger very good burger better than most around. Great specials e-club and apps  I will be back to try their breakfast and dinner."}
{"text":"Wonderful food - Was very excited to see a locally owned restaurant/bar take over this location and even more excited to hear they were going to be a sports bar. I have tried many items on the menu (dinner and lunch), all have been very well prepared and delivered almost immediately after ordering. My favorite is the Pulled Pork with the \"haymaker\" onion rings. Would rate the food 5/5. Very friendly servers who are attentive and knowledgeable of their unique menu items.  Generally, I eat at the bar and Sal is a fabulous bartender. He juggles many orders and is very attentive to the patrons, however not intrusive. Sal is very experienced and is a good reference if you need drink suggestions.  Haymaker prides themselves as being a sports bar with tremendous pride in their coverage of football.  They do have great television sets and Sal willingly changes channels for your favorite games; however they have obnoxiously loud country music all the time. The country theme is their schtick; yet over powers their potential to attract sports fans. The music is so loud, one can't hold a conversation without yelling. Tough to watch any game unless you read lips. I intentionally avoid going there if I want to watch and hear a game. Would rate them 2/5 as a sports bar."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another try. I can say that the service was great this time. Jesse the Bartender  was interactive with the customers and made sure everybody was happy and enjoying themselves. This place is a great place to go and relax and just enjoy yourself. The food was excellent. The management was very pleasant. I can actually recommend this restaurant to anybody in town or coming through town."}
{"text":"First time and last time at this restaurant.  Service and food are terrible.  Waiter came to our table and asked what we want to drink.  We had no menus.  Told him we need menus.  Waited a long time for her to return.  Ordered food.  Wait was ok.  Beer arrived.  Gave us the wrong beers.  Ordered the pulled pork sandwich with cold slaw and sweet potato fries.  Sweet potato fries were good.  It went downhill from there.  Pulled pork was dry, overcooked (burnt) and tasted like a leftover from several days ago.  The cold slaw was terrible - like biting directly out of a head of cabbage.  Finished the meal.  Then waited and waited and waited ......... for the server to bring bill or at least ask if we wanted anything else.  This is an unbelievable place.  There is obviously something here more than the food and beer but have not figured it out.  While it is almost impossible to screw up a beer, they did their best by giving us the wrong beers.  The food is horrible and the service is unbelievably bad.  One star is to high a rating.  I have never left no tip up until tonight.  She deserved all she got - nothing."}
{"text":"A restaurant  where  the feeling of being  in America is only overshadowed  by the great American food and Welcome  Feelings from the staff  I will tell  all my friends. This is Americana at its best."}
{"text":"We like going here for dinner as a family. We went again last night and again had a good experience!  There is a large selection of food from burgers to ribs to salads. And they always have a large selection of micro brews!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Good food, comfortable atmosphere and great beer on tap! Jill is the best bartender! She makes it worth the trip!"}
{"text":"We returned to the Haymaker to try it one more time. It obvious, management has changed or on site. Great service and food like it used to be. We are so glad the owners listened."}
{"text":"Great food. Great Americana (I guess that's the best way to describe it) atmosphere. Friendly staff and clean restaurant. Really enjoy eating there."}
{"text":"Traditional menu for American food but the service is amazing. Their servers are always up for getting you whatever you need quickly. They are not immature young people who roll their eyes for having to do their job. I have gone here for breakfast, cocktails, and dinner. I have always received great service and have been very satisfied. My parents also like coming here for breakfast. It's a great place to go with the family."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood spot that actually follows through on the solid home cooking.  A little dark when you walk in- several \"blocked exits\" and tacky window decals lead to the east.  We are nicely greeted and seated in Jens area- which she turns out to be authentic and obviously really good at her job.  The margarita is nice and limey and for $6 I ain't mad at it.  My buffalo chicken sandwich is super hot, crispy, well seasoned and on buttery Texas toast.  Homemade Cajun fries don't disappoint and I appreciate the ranch side.  Apparently the Texas burger was awesome too... when my mom left her leftovers on the table - she nearly cried and made me look in the fridge and the car to make sure.  The only downside is the cheap generic branded ketchup... gimme the Heinz and we can be besties."}
{"text":"Murica, Jesus, Service, Food.  Seems that is the order of importance in this establishment.  I love this country, but don't care for politics or religion with dinner.  Felt like I walked into the Faux News Cafe...  Our server was pleasant which was the only part of the experience that was.    We started with Fried Pickles and they were just Vlasic spears...barely fried, and served with Thousand Island dressing.  Blah...  I ordered the French Dip.  It reminded me of a hot pocket with its canned mushrooms and burnt onions.  The fries were also undercooked.  My wife ordered the buffalo chicken salad.  I kid you not it was a side salad with a chicken tender cut up on top.  1 tender!  It looked like a salad from the kids menu.  I have felt like crap since I left there too.    With so many great options around here I do not think this place will last!  We will not be back...."}
{"text":"Had weekday lunch at the bar.  Decent lunch specials, burger and chicken wrap were good.  Look forward to returning for lunch weekly.  Maybe teach the staff how to change the channel on the TV's.  Good beer selection too."}
{"text":"Breakfast all day!  Huge biscuits.  My 11 year old son loved the frickles (fried pickles).  If we'd been there for dinner, I would have had the Moscow Mule because they actually have real copper mugs to serve them in!  Happy hour early in the day with big appetizers!  Our service was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Neighborhood place for us. Looks identical to the Native New Yorker that occupied this space previously. Average sports bar feel. Wife and I both had Veggie Omelette with Swiss. Took 40 minutes. Under seasoned. Service was good, kitchen slow. Probably won't be back. Too bad."}
{"text":"Me and my wife are able to get away from tome to time and always have a great time at the haymaker. We sit in one of the two booths in the bar and always enjoy their happy hour which starts at 11am. Super nice and friendly workers. Always a good time."}
{"text":"Amazing Jill was my server she was sweet from the moment i walked in she not only got to know us but she hit it on the nail with her suggestions!! Sean also stopped by to say hi just becau6se it was amazing!!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for a while, and a YELP review is overdue.  Had yet another amazing meal tonight at dinner; I had the Blackened Chicken Sandwich (with Habanero Aioli), perfectly cooked, juicy and AMAZING.  My daughter got the grilled chicken platter with steamed broccoli (so fresh and yummy!) - and every bite was phenomenal.  Our server (Madison) was personable, charming and attentive - and never missed a step.  This place is seriously top-notch awesome, and if I could give it 6 stars, I would.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"My husband and I waited over 45 minutes for our lunch. Won't be back any time soon. Obviously we were forgotten."}
{"text":"So we attempted to eat there today for breakfast but I'm not sure what happened to their kitchen staff. We waited for 45 minutes to be sat only to be turned away. Everyone that was coming in the door at that point was being turned away. The manager told us it would be another 45 minutes before he could serve us. Well and then later I saw an add on Craigslist that they were looking to hire kitchen staff. The only thing he gave us for the inconvenience was some cards for a free appetizer. We left and went to another restaurant that was also a disappointment."}
{"text":"Getting great service today! I'm definitely happy we decided to come back! We love the food and the atmosphere here and now the service is back up to where it used to be. We will definitely be regulars again! Thanks Haymaker"}
{"text":"This place has a great vibe and the food is excellent. The staff is decent enough and the bar is top notch. I'd recommend this place for breakfast, lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Wonderful lunch turned my day around as Madison,  our waitress,  helped me to craft my chicken,  real mushrooms, Swiss cheese on Texas Toast sandwich.  I had that after we split the zucchini and onion ring appetizers. The deep fry was light and crisp-perfect.  My dad had the huevos rancheros benedictos and loved them as they had the perfect amount of spice. I just cannot give a perfect score as we were so full we couldn't try or even spilt dessert.  Hopefully next time it will be a perfect score with dessert."}
{"text":"Great place, great food,great atmosphere, amazing happy hour prices. I highly recommend the catfish tacos and the french dip! Definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Came back for a second try since my husband wasn't too happy with his meal the first time. We ordered hot wings to start.  Then my husband ordered the country fried steak.  I had half a pastrami sandwich and a cup of chili.  For dessert we had the campfire cookie.  All was delicious!!  He was happy and wants to return and try the breakfast. :)"}
{"text":"We came in Monday night for the first time. We have lived in the area for awhile but never knew it was there! I'm so glad we found it! Food is amazing! Love the patriotic theme! Being locally owned is definitely a plus! Our server Marc was super friendly and made us feel welcome! Can say this will be our new spot from now on! Can't wait to try out the whiskey selection!"}
{"text":"It was our first time in and the burgers we're amazing! Service was great! I highly recommend stopping in!"}
{"text":"4 stars. Beer on tap is great. Zuchini appetizer was smaller then expected for the price. My two boys split the sirloin which was good, I had the french dip which was excellent. The wife had the steak sandwich which was good also. Pretty good overall!"}
{"text":"So this is the 3rd time I've been here with my wife and it just don't get no better. Tonight I had the Chicken Fried Chicken, this is the best Gravy I have ever tasted. I'm totally not a fan of gravy but I have to admit this was the bomb!  Oh and by the way I'm not having dessert tonight cause I have some at home, but if I was it definitely would be their awesome bread pudding.  Also just an FYI, Erin who has always been my server is the most awesome person who will be dearly missed as she is going back home to be a full time mom. I bet she is awesome at that too!"}
{"text":"My favorite item on the menu here is the strawberry avocado salad with grilled salmon. Consistently perfect. Parker and Sal have served me on several occasions and are always excellent. Thank you for the outstanding service Parker and Sal!"}
{"text":"We are moving to the area and explored breakfast places.  We decided to visit the Haymaker.  It was a very good decision.  The food was very good (eggs Benedict), although the centers were cooked a bit too hard, the service prompt and friendly.  I spoke with our server about some football items which made us feel very much \"at home\".  There were many games on the screens surrounding the dining area which was great also.  The only suggestion - which is keeping me from awarding 5 stars - is the wait time and the centers of the Benedict being over cooked.  We got there and there were at least 4 or 5 tables empty, but the line of customers was not addressed.  On the positive side, the manager saw that situation and sent people to wipe them down and get the line moving.  We will definitely be back - perhaps for what looks like a great happy hour menu, and breakfast next weekend is a certainty for us at The Haymaker."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with friendly, courteous staff - always available but not overbearing.  The all day breakfasts were awesome and the blackened chicken was the best I've had in a long while.  We all were beyond delighted with our meals - highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food was good but not great.  Texan burger was tasty but quesadilla was bland and my daughter only ate one slice.  Service was a little slow but both the hostess and server were super friendly.  Server was familiar with menu and gave recommendations.  We weren't offered re-fills until it was time to go but he did offer them to-go.  Family friendly."}
{"text":"They offer many gluten free menu options, which is very refreshing! The tuna melt on gluten free, toasted bread and green salad were delicious. Quality ingredients, large selection and an attentive, polite waitress earns them 5 stars!"}
{"text":"My partner and I went on vacation to visit family and stayed at a resort NW west of Phoenix (Peoria).The resort had no restaurant on property so they recommended the Haymaker.  If we mentioned we stayed at the resort a discount was given, we ate there every day after our first visit. Omelets for the most part light and fluffy and very filling.  Food was consistently good. I especially loved that they had sour dough toast every time. We never left hungry as you can see by the picture.  Staff was sweet and friendly and got to know us. What was fun about the Haymaker was on your way out  the door, a container of root beer barrels was on top of the hostess stand, it was a must to grab a hand full every day. The barrels tasted like the real deal, almost birch like.  Made me feel like a kid again.  While unpacking, found one in a pair of shorts, immediately put in my mouth.  Will definitely  be back when we visit family again."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday about 1 pm not to busy. Friendly waitress all smiles.   Portions for me were big could have shared the plate but a good lunch.  Will Return to try bfast."}
{"text":"Nice restraunt with decent food.  We drove quite a distance to try this place...it was good but not spectacular.   I ordered the pulled pork sandwhich.  The server raved about it being the best thing ever.  I'm a BBQ lover, so I was game.  It was just okay.  Make sure u get extra bbq...it was dry dry dry.  My husband ordered the cardiologist burger.  This thing was massive!! It was good but so incredibly greasy.  The bottom bun fell apart the minute he picked it up.    Overall the experience was okay....was hoping for more.  We will come back to try breakfast possibly...hoping for better luck with that.  Was hoping for 5 stars....but 3 it is for now."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place after my aunt recommended it to me for breakfast. To my disappointment the food was not to my liking. Let's first day location is good place was clean decorated nice. Staff was pleasant but they need a new cook food tastes like grease had not been charged it left me with a nasty after taste. Coffee was too strong too. Not a good breakfast place to recommend."}
{"text":"Don't try and order a to go order from them unless you feel like being put on hold several times then being laughed at to finally having the manager come on the phone to say \"Cool, I'll take your order\" with a constant on hold beeping sound in the background.   Unfortunately it won't be a place I'll be recommending anymore or going there myself.   Handling to go orders efficiently can make or break the bank in my opinion......I added 2 more stars because the owner reached out and apologized"}
{"text":"I came back for lunch today and ordered the Hot Pastrami. It included a generous pile of thinly sliced meat and Swiss cheese. Solid sandwich.  The onion rings I won't order again.  They were \"ok\", but I was kind of expecting hand-dipped.    It is still dimly lit, but being seated by a window helps."}
{"text":"I visited the Litchfield location this morning on a mother daughter breakfast date, the food and service was amazing. I decided to take my husband, children and sister in law for dinner (same location). We asked our waitress if we were still in time for happy hour appetizers, she said yes you have 20 mins. We ordered appetizers, then dinner. Our food came out and we asked the server about our appetizers, our waitress came back and said \"happy hour was changed to 6pm and we have not changed the signs, if I bring appetizers they are full price\" this was at 7:06pm. I told her that if they have it advertised on all the menus including the happy hour menu at the table they should honor it. She gave us blank stare, I asked for the manager. When he showed up he down played what happened telling us \"there is much worse things that have happened in your life, then not getting your appetizers\" then proceeded to say \"it's just food\".  He then blamed the waitress stating \"we try and train them right and when we mentioned a change in the menu some take it to heart\" I was flabbergasted at his response, and apparently does not have enough experience in the food industry. Before he left our table he was being sarcastic and undermining the whole situation.  I thought this would be a place to make our regular since we live so close by, but I was utterly let down. I would not recommend this place based on the awful service we receive today."}
{"text":"There was first time with friend yesterday.  Service was good, house wine was good, food was good.  New to Arizona, but will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our dinner.  Hubby savored the ribs while I noshed on a luscious strawberry salad with added salmon.   The atmosphere is comfortable and relaxed with pleasant wait staff.  I'm looking forward to returning soon for breakfast.  I was very appreciative of their decor and they give military discounts, too!"}
{"text":"This is a rough one for me as to 3 or 4 stars so with that being said it's fair to the Haymaker to go with 4 stars. The food is good, the atmosphere is fine, portion size is good. My issue isn't with any of that, might be a personal issue, I have those! I had the ribs, literally fall off the bone ribs! BBQ sauce is okay, nothing special. I'll keep coming here because it has a great variety of food and I get something different each time. Breakfast is served all day and that's a bonus for some. This immediate area consists of a lot of fast food and pizza so the Haymaker is a much better choice for me and that's why I'm going with 4 stars. We had a very chatty server last night that appeared to be acting as a Shill for another one of their locations because she talked about the other location, \"her location\" Ad nauseam. It got to be a little like the Twilight Zone, like is she that into herself? The other location? I simply wanted to eat and not have to endure a \"commercial\" every time she appeared at the table.  It's better than fast food and I'll be back because of that."}
{"text":"Awesome quality and taste of food! I love the way they make their bacon! The mason Jars were a nice touch too."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast and we were very impressed. The food was all really good and fair prices. Went for dinner later and the burger was nice. We like the atmosphere and they have a good drink selection including a ton of whisky."}
{"text":"Excellent food & great service! My husband had the cardiologist burger and it was amazing! I like the option for half salad & sand which too! Can't wait try the breakfast! Oh and the SALMON! Yum!"}
{"text":"I love haymaker!  I've been going to the Peoria location for quite a while and have always enjoyed it. Great food and very good service. Today I came into the Litchfield location expecting the same experience. I was very wrong. The male hostess was so very rude to me that it tainted the entire experience. I will never be back to a restaurant that employs this type of person."}
{"text":"Great people.....Great food.....Reasonably priced food selections! I have been to the Haymaker a number of times and was never disappointed. I love the patriotic theme and the obvious respect for our Military and First Responders. This is an \"old school\" establishment who knows how to treat their customers professionally and with dignity and respect!"}
{"text":"This is a very cute restaurant that is a small business so I like to support businesses like this.  Mandy was a very friendly and efficient server.  I had the mac & cheese and the blackened catfish tacos.  The tacos were a little bit greasy other than that they were delicious but super spicy so watch out!  I appreciate the Pledge of Allegiance on the wall as you enter it's nice to see that.  Let me just comment on the yelp review person who mentioned the restaurant being too patriotic.  Apparently this person is not proud of this country and maybe should move somewhere else."}
{"text":"Food....Average. Service...Below average. Gave more than one opportunity....same results."}
{"text":"Great happy hour, good beer selection- could be better if had more Pale Ales on their menu.  But even so, I've found something good to drink every time I've been here. Burgers are great!  Managers:  Please add a few songs produced in this century, and not country to your rotation. Just a few every hour, please and thank you!!  Update:  a few great songs in the mix and Monkey Knife Fight on tap!!  Sweet!  Thanks Austin!!"}
{"text":"Very relaxing family friendly atmosphere with amazing food and drinks. We had the best waitress and the food was delicious. It is now a family favorite. I would definitely recommend this place to my family and friends. 5 star"}
{"text":"We are in town visiting relatives and they brought us here for lunch. It was a group of us- 6 adults and 4 children and they greeted us with smiles and we're happy to seat us quickly. Very affordable lunches and a great variety to choose from. We each got a sandwich of some kind and fries. There wasn't any left over to even take home. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm updating my review since the only issue Haymaker has ever had was slow service and that seems to have been corrected! Glenn and the other staff members are really putting on their best for patrons now! Plus this place has THE BEST wings in the Valley! Do yourself a favor and get them extra crispy with a medium/Parm sauce mix! It'll change your life!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here with my family on several times.  The food and service are always great.  They love our country and care about the customers.  Love the fried zucchini. It's one of the few places that my 2 and 4 year olds clean their plates"}
{"text":"I wish half stars were available because I don't think it's a complete 3 stars but 4 star is too much lol. The reason I rated it 3 stars is because it's hit or miss with this location. We learned to call ahead and put our name down. If not, you'll be waiting forever for seats (you might as well pack a lunch) and we're just a party of 2.5 (my little mini-me who's 11 mo). We've been here about four times. This review is based off what my husband and I have had.   The food: I wasn't a big fan of the chicken fried steak meal. Their wings were decent, juicy and big. Their pancakes too dry (it tasted like Krusteaz's pancake mix) but super fluffy. The French toast, definitely worth getting, our favorite. The Western Eggs Benedict was delicious, but potatoes are always hard. I feel like I'm going to chip my tooth. Eggs are good. Beef veggie soup is decent. And my husband did not like the pulled pork skillet, he said it's plain and no taste (he's not even a picky eater).   The service, well it depends who you get. Some people are super nice and others, well you'll be lucky to see them more than twice.   The reason we keep coming back, the location is convenient and we really want to like this place. But obviously, it's not super terrible since we've been there four times :)  PS if you plan on having a big party, call ahead this place gets packed."}
{"text":"Had the Pulled Pork Breakfast and it was great. Kerry the waitress I would give 6 stars.Have been to Haymaker a number of times and never had any problems.  Returned for  breakfast Sunday morning. Mandy was my server she was fantastic. I had the Arizona omelette for seniors. Pretty good size for the money and was very tasty."}
{"text":"First impressions are Everything!! It's hard to enjoy a good meal when all you can smell is raw sewage all throughout the restaurant. I ate here a few days ago and just remembered to write a review and the only memorable thing about this place is the smell.   No Bueno."}
{"text":"This by far is my favorite breakfast place in Glendale/Peoria and not just because they have gluten free toast! The food is very good and the service is very friendly. As with any other restaurant if they're busy service can slow down a little, but they are usually pretty on top of it!  They have several gluten free options and a full bar as well, serving breakfast lunch and dinner! Great place for fun date or a family, or just hanging with your friends!!"}
{"text":"Have you heard of this place?  I hadn't, and I drive past there all the time.  I found a coupon in a mass mailer and noticed that it was right near the resort, which is great because Lakeside and Squid Ink have been the only decent places over there for a while.  I don't know what to comment on first - the quality, the quantity, or the price.  All were great.  I went to school in Texas and I think this is the closest thing to real barbecue I've had since leaving.  Between us we had steak, chicken, ribs, burgers, sweet potato fries, coleslaw, potatoes, mac and cheese, and bread pudding.  I don't know many people who are as serious about making everything just right as I am, but this was pretty impressive.  Sauces were great, everything cooked perfectly, and nice, tender meat.  The kids even ate everything, and I mean EVERYTHING.  That's one weird (but good) sign I noticed when we got there - almost everybody had kids, whereas usually we're the only ones.  Service was pretty quick too, so there were no grumpy babies.  The portions are pretty huge but the prices are about normal for casual dining...so wait, it's unique, better, and bigger, but for the same price?  Wow, tough choice between here and the Chili's across the street, huh?  Oh, and did I mention BREAD PUDDING?  Mmm.  Bread pudding."}
{"text":"This place is located off Tatum and Bell.  I drive by this place almost everyday.  I know couple of years ago this place was a Mexican joint and recently it was a Native New Yorker.  The building is pretty big and location is great, so I am confused why previous businesses have failed.  So when this place opened, I was skeptical on how it would do or even last.  Well I saw a great deal on Groupon for 18.00 bucks you get 30.00 dollars worth of food.  So I told my fiancee, lets give this place a try........boy I am glad i did!  This place was awesome.  They have a great ambiance and the staff was extremely friendly.  Most importantly the food was delicious!  My fiancee and I ordered the two egg plate, with pancakes and I ordered the country fried steak with eggs.  Everything was flavorful and delicious.  Our waiter checked on us several times and the owner or manager even stopped by.  The service was outstanding.  If the food was just average, I would go back again, cause they were friendly and very inviting.  My lady and I are huge breakfast fans, we like to go out on the weekends and enjoy ourselves.  We normally go to the Oink Cafe, 40th Street Cafe, The Original Breakfast House, Matt's big breakfast and The Perk Eatery. I can proudly say we will be adding The Haymaker to the rotation.  Give this place a try, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Our initial reaction didn't start off well. Once we heard about the wait for a table we went to the bar only to never be served by the bartender. After 10 minutes we went back to the host. He saw we were never waited on and immediately directed us to a table. He came back over and told us that our breakfast was all taken care of. We weren't expecting that. He really made us feel welcome and appreciated our business. The food was great and the service ( after the bar incident) was amazing. Definitely a great spot for some breakfast/Americana food. Thank you for the meal!"}
{"text":"I always, always, always try and fit a trip here when I go to visit friends and family in Peoria. My introduction to Haymaker started a few years ago when I was craving fish and chips. So I got on my trusty Yelp app and looked up \"fish and chips\". That first visit began a long lasting, and ongoing love affair with this wonderful restaurant.   The fish and chips are superb. Perfectly seasoned, never greasy, always delicious. However, I have ventured out over the years and have sampled some of their other delicious plates. Burgers (the Cardiologist, I think it's called, is spectacular), a great selection of eggs Benedict for brunch, and their always rotating beer list make this a place I am happy to go back to every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"We like The Haymaker. I want to get that in in the beginning of my review. It's decent. But, while the food is okay, the steak was disappointing. I have gotten breakfast there before and it was good and I liked it a lot but when I went back for dinner and got a steak it had little to no seasoning on it. If you like a grilled steak that's very plain Jane you'll be happy. I just felt like I had to keep dipping it in A-1 sauce for some flavor.   Other items I have gotten there were pretty good. The ribs are good and some of their salads are good. My husband got a sandwich there he liked. I just wouldn't classify this as a steak house even though that's the vibe it is going for.   Overall, We will go back. I like that it is a local restaurant and I know the owners are great people. They have been active in the community and donated to community causes which makes me want to support them. The breakfast was great, the dinner was okay, and the service is always good. You won't leaving there thinking it was the best meal you've ever had but you will be satisfied."}
{"text":"Although the outside looks like a warehouse store,the inside is very well designed. The food is very tasty. I had the 'Grown up grilled cheese' and their addition of brie to the traditional combo of cheddar and bacon makes it special. I will definitely return to try the other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"My wife and I drove over here from S. California to do some site seeing, went to The Haymaker Restaurant for our first dinner, and liked it so well we returned for our last meal as well.  The food choices were good, especially the bread pudding, but what really stands out is their friendly and professional staff.  Thanks Mitchell and Manny for some enjoyable meals."}
{"text":"I love eating here. It's typical \"diner\" food, but has such a warm and inviting ambience. Staff is always friendly. I've only had breakfast here- and every time it's good. French toast is great, biscuits and gravy is wonderful (huge biscuits!) I love that specialty drinks come in mason jars. Family friendly, the menu has something for everyone."}
{"text":"My first visit to Haymaker was fine, typical American lunch fare. I arranged to meet a friend for lunch to try other items on the menu. Unfortunately when I walked up, it smelled like sewage.  Walking inside, it smelled worse.  Someone at the front was going to seat us until I asked if that was sewage I smelled in which they responded: \"Yes, the bathrooms backed up and it also affected the kitchen.\" I understand that things like this can happen but why try to operate a restaurant when your place smells like a port-o-potty?  Why would your staff to go so far to tie the backed up bathroom to your kitchen?  Not appetizing and I could never trust your establishment again.  Sorry."}
{"text":"Dinner was below average. They advertise steak, but the only steak on the dinner menu is a sirloin. We will try breakfast at some point. We've heard the breakfasts are solid."}
{"text":"I get that the restaurant is new, but I walked in at 7:28 AM for breakfast. Saw several customers seated and waiting for a server or food or something. Waited to be seated. Waited. Got a couple smiles from seated customers who were sharing my experience. Waited a bit more. Not an employee in sight. Walked out at 7:38.  I'll probably give them another chance. But not this week."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch. Took the veggie burger and fries. It was nice enough and topped with avocado and pepper. Washed it down with a hot green tea. Very cheap."}
{"text":"The best brunch place after Sunday mass. They have cool ambiance and excellent manager (Manny)."}
{"text":"Went there on sunday and the food was delicious! We were seated right away and automatically the decor took my attention! Very memorable american felt i was at home. Id actually recommend the haymaker! Tastes very good!"}
{"text":"The server was a nice person but the soda was flat the boneless wings were so gross... We also  had a chicken Cesar salad that was nasty as well I would never go back to this place EVER! we had a party of 10 people and not one person liked the food..."}
{"text":"Really good food and great service! We liked this place a lot. Smiles all around. It was nice to be thanked by the owner and our baby was nicely accommodated too. We like places like this. My salad was perfect. The fried zucchini appetizer was just right. The apple pie drink is also best with their apple pie. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The Haymaker on Bell &Tatum has great food and awesome service. Sal one of the bartenders is The Best!! Always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I went with the huevos rancheros. They are excellent. Never had a bad meal in here. The atmosphere is awesome and they support our military."}
{"text":"This place is really good for lunch/dinner. Always satisfied with my meal. It's breakfast service is very lacking. Which makes me wonder why even bother if everything is just store bought and canned. I don't remember exactly what it was but I had French toast with some kind of fruit on top. The French toast was great but the fruit on top was straight from a can and very very cold making my French toast cold in the process. If they're going to do canned fruit at least heat it a little. Throw it in a microwave for all I care I just don't want refrigerator cold fruit on my warm French toast. Not when it still has all the goopy syrup.  Thats the word I was looking for, pie filling. It's pie filling fruit. I don't even like canned pie filling in a pie.  Though I do have to say the wings here are fantastic. I am usually not a person for wings because they always seem to have too much uncooked skin around the meat. I absolutely hate anything that has a fatty or gelatinous consistency. So wings where the skin is not crispy or at least mostly is gross to me. These were awesome."}
{"text":"Serves breakfast all day! So kudos for that.  Decor is comfortable casual, decent sized bar you can eat at but it is usually full.  I couldn't resist the all day breakfast so I ordered the chili omelette it's fairly basic, cheese omelette topped with chili, cheese and onion and my partner and I ordered fried zucchini to share.  The omelette was so good and I am very picky about my eggs, I'm not a chili person so it's odd why I ordered this but the chili had a great taste that blended well with the cheese and onion.  I would definitely order it again.  The fried zucchini however is a no go, huge pieces of sliced zucchini, so visually I was salivating but the breading on it was so thick that even though the vegetable was a good sized slice all you could taste is batter and grease.  I like fried food but I like to taste a little bit of the food that has been fried.  Hash browns.... ok and the toast (if you could call it that) toast indicates the bread has been toasted, mine was just like slices put in the toaster for 6 seconds.  Friendly service but not attentive, no checking on us had to make eye contact and hold up my empty cup to get a refill."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch with my girls and it was delicious. Between 7am-12pm they have happy hour specials but the price is decent for such hearty food. I had a Manmosa for the first time and would recommend it. Because we went on a Sunday it became pretty busy which is understandable with the church crowd coming in but our server was down to earth and funny so we enjoyed our time there."}
{"text":"Took my in laws to the Haymaker Saturday night and it was Amazing! This out third time there, and we have had nothing but perfect food and unbeatable service. Our waitress Cheyenne was on the ball. As a former waitress myself, I appreciated her timing and attention to detail, especially with regard to my children ....sometimes things like bringing the kids food first and remembering extra napkins without being asked means the difference between an enjoyable dinner and a ruined night! She was fantastic, the food was fantastic and The Haymakers appreciation for our Military is unmatched!"}
{"text":"I've had breakfast here a few times and can say that they have always been pleasant experiences. Service is always friendly and prompt and my meals are always delicious. The one meal that stands out to this day is the breakfast sandwich. It's simple, but delicious. A little on the heavy side, but something that I would definitely reorder. Large portions and even better prices!"}
{"text":"We love to come here because we are ALWAYS satisfied!   From the service to the menu choices and of course the food quality and bang for your buck!  The ONLY draw back for us...it's not close enough to our home!  ;p But ALWAYS worth the drive!"}
{"text":"First visit to Arizona and the Haymaker is right down the road from our Blue Green Resort. What an awesome find!! Ate there yesterday on our first day here. It was so good we went back today for breakfast. Yesterday I had the French Dip, my husband had a burger and we split some wings. It was all so yummy!! Our waitress was Jenna who was so friendly and did I mention she makes the BEST Bacon Bloody Mary!! Went this morning for an omelet which was one of the best I ever had!! The hubby had sausage gravy and biscuits. Again super yummy and our waiter was great....and oh yeah...another awesome Bacon Bloody Mary made by Jenna. They are going to be tired of seeing us. I must go one more time to try the burgers!!"}
{"text":"Back again with the family this time around.  First off, I found out that there was no longer happy hour on Saturday.  Boooo.  I even asked the hostess if hh was offered everywhere or just the bar, and her response was \"everywhere\".  So I assumed hh was still a go.  Any way, my wife asked for sweet potato fries with her tuna melt instead she got regular fries.  No biggie.  So, we let the waitress know that she wanted sweet potato fries and she said she would put the order in...unfortunately, we never saw them.  One more complaint, my boys wanted a refill on their chocolate milk...come to find out after I looked at the check, I was charged for the refills.  Really!? Maybe 6oz cups of milk.  How sad to be nickled and dimed for a kids meal."}
{"text":"I had the cardiologist burger with sweet potato fries and an Xtra side of cole slaw.  My meal was delicious nice atmosphere and friendly service. My husband and I also shared the campfire cookie and very glad we did. We will be back. Again very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Ordered steak sandwich and it was ok. Service a little slow but nice. Needs improvement. Since its a new place i will try them again."}
{"text":"So.... Okay. It's just okay. Music is rough at best and too loud. Our server Zach was nice and tried hard. The BLAT bacon was super salty and the \"Ribbies\" were moist but not flavorful a little Bill Johnson's bbq for my taste. Might try again sometime."}
{"text":"Came here while on vacation with my wife. Service was lacking. We were sat at the bar, and the bartender was more interested in flirting with patrons at the bar than taking our order. I had the buffalo chicken sandwich, my wife had the pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries. Her fries were cold when they arrived, the lettuce on my sandwich was brown. I would have complained, but the bartender only came back to give us the check.   We will not be back.   Bonus: An older couple sitting next to us ordered wings and was given the wrong sauces, one being too spicy for the woman. She was offered water instead of a corrected order."}
{"text":"I will give two stars cause I think the burgers are pretty tasty but that is if you can get it. We have had horrible service every time we go there (literally). We haven't been there once were the waiter or waitress got to our table to take our drink order within 10 min of sitting down. I think twice I have asked for someone to get our waiter/waitress and I have complained to management at least twice and it still is lackluster on the service part. Such a shame as it has such potential to be a four or five star place in my book if they could just overcome the poor service. Sorry haymakers I want to give you more stars and I will keep trying, but I don't think it will happen as others in our neighborhood have said the same and even told management and service is still an issue."}
{"text":"Poor service once shame on you, poor service twice shame on me for coming back.   We've been here 3-4 times, the staff is rude. Several times my wife and I sat at the bar and thought the bartender was a jerk.  Last time we went we were sat at a table. We waited 10 minutes nobody came to take our drink order or otherwise acknowledged us. Then a table next to us that had just been seated had a server come take their drink order.   We left. Never again. Too bad, we liked the atmosphere and the menu/food was t bad."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Saturday and was pleasantly surprised that happy hour is 11-7 on Saturday. Although the only reason we found that out was because I asked how many sliders you got with the order and was told two during happy hour, three otherwise. The angus sliders were very good.   Kids meals are $5 and include fries and a drink. For kids on the older end of the kids menu, opt for the second burger for only $1 because the kids burger is a slider. The regular burgers are 1/2lb patties. The adult grilled cheese was okay, nothing special.   Cute place, decent size with Americana decor. Staff was very friendly but kind of a strange mix of people. Hope this one stays. We need more places like this in this area."}
{"text":"Always great service and really good breakfast! It can get a little crowded in the mid morning on the weekends, and the waiting area is pretty terrible with very little seating inside and one two person bench outside.  But, the food is really good."}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot in North Peoria."}
{"text":"Loved the adult cheese sandwich. Great family and adult atmosphere . Large selection of craft beers . Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"It is our first time here and we came here for breakfast. Staff are all warm in welcoming us and the decor is nice and very modern rustic. Food is excellent, I ordered Haymaker Benedict and it was devine. One suggestion is hopefully they will have espresso in the near future. We will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Good breakfast. Looks like they are testing out doing breakfast all day instead of only until 11 am. I was so glad! I was hoping for brunch on a Sunday and they didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"What has happened to this place? We came for brunch today (a Sunday) at 1:00 and asked for a booth. We were told, no because they're all dirty! Oh,wait... we do have one. We were seated in a corner booth in the bar area, and the entire hour we were there, the dirty booth next to ours was never cleaned.  When we asked our waitress if there was any word on our food after waiting nearly 30 minutes (and I tracked her down, she never once came to check on us) she said \"it's coming, it's busy\". With attitude. After another 10 minutes, I asked for the manager. I have worked in restaurants so I try give the benefit of the doubt, and I saw our server was busy, but seriously! Half an hour for eggs, oatmeal and a burger? The manger was very nice and said he would get the food right over and it would be comped. Even though, we left most of the food behind.  We used to appreciate this neighborhood, reasonably priced place, but if they continue down this path they won't be busy much longer."}
{"text":"This is my second time to this place. The first time we were there on a Saturday before noon and were forced to order breakfast ad they didn't serve lunch until noon. The breakfast was pretty good though I didn't care for the biscuit...too big and VERY dry. Thank god I had gravy with it. The other was normal breakfast items and as I said it wad good.  Yesterday we went at 11:45 and were prepared to order breakfast, but low and behold we were there at lunch time. I ordered the chicken fried steak, sister ordered the french dip and Mom ordered the half tuna melt and soup (potato). It really makes me wonder why restaurants buy pre-made food and pass it off as fresh made. The CFS was obviously frozen. How much would it cost to buy fresh and make it there? The veggies were a frozen mix. But the gravy was good. I had to ask for a roll and the waitress said they came in an order of 3 and she would have to charge me. I said Ok and now wish I hadn't. What came out was 3 slider rolls that were taken out of a package and put in a basket. They were not warmed and in fact were stale! The soup was canned as well and needed a lot of seasoning. In fact, everything needed salt and pepper. Overall not a good meal."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat Sunday morning and our first choice was actually Cracker Barrel but with a 40 minute wait, we decided to try out Haymaker instead.  Glad we did because it was not busy at all.  We were greeted and seated promptly and had our drink orders taken right away.  After a few minutes of looking at the menu, we decided on the Griddle Breakfast with pancakes and the Country Fried Steak.  Our waitress was friendly and not overbearing.  She seemed knowledgeable about the menu and even recommended getting one of their omelettes the next time we came in.  The food arrived and the portions were huge!  It tasted great.  Not sure why this spot always changes (from McGrath's to Caballeros) but hopefully Haymaker sticks around cause we'll probably come back again to try their lunch/dinner options!"}
{"text":"I went there with my two boys and when I walked in the 2 hosts weren't very friendly, once I got seated it took a while for our server to arrive, and when she did she wasn't very friendly and didn't give me her name. The food came out, it was alright. I guess I was expecting more out of it. I got the breakfast burrito and it came with a side of like 4 tortilla chips which I thought was different (I didn't eat them) and the server forgot the potatoes I asked for. She never came to ask us if we needed anything, but another young lady did and she was also the one that brought me my check as I didn't see my server after the food was brought out. I probably won't return nor will I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I am not a big Yelp contributor,  but I am so disappointed in The Haymaker.  I loved this restaurant when it first opened and I would always take friends and family there when they visited from out of town.  Each time I have visited in the past few months, it has been going down hill.  When I used to visit The Haymaker, my glass would never be empty. Now, I never get a refill.  They used to put a leaf of lettuce on the burgers/sandwiches,  now it's shredded. They used to offer a to go iced Coffee when we left, now they do not. They had the best Toasted Almond flavored iced coffee, now they do not. They didn't have marinara sauce for the mozzarella sticks, no marinara available (Saturday afternoon). They have $2 Bud Light drafts for happy hour which is fantastic. There was a butt end of a tomato on my \"medium\" burger which was medium/rare. I asked for an onion slice on my burger, there was one ring of onion (see picture). I will not be visiting The Haymaker unless I hear things change."}
{"text":"Absolutely love love LOVE this place. The food is always soo good and the staff is very friends and quick. I like that the bar is up at the front and the bartender is very knowledgeable in specialty drinks. Very kid friendly as well as adult friendly. I give it 4 stars because the parking lot is always extremely packed."}
{"text":"This place was awsome. The food was so good the burgers were excellent.  I had the fried chicken Loreto very good.  My friend had the Texan burger.  Both came with frings which is 3 onion rings with a side of fries.  We had Brittany and she was fantastic. Friendly and was on top of all our food and extras.  Defiently a place to go.  Also happy hour food everyday."}
{"text":"I love that they are super military friendly. My husband loves the burgers, I however do not like the food. It lacks flavor and is just bland. However the service is incredible, and owners, managers and servers are all awesome"}
{"text":"Hey all my Az peeps there is a new breakfast place in town!!! Haymakers. Service is great, prices affordable, food taste delicious.  My favorite part is the decor ... Lots of woods and brick and a wonderful display of America and respect for our Lord!!!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday night, and it was really empty. A place like this, especially during baseball playoffs, should be hopping. Not one person at the bar.   The young girl that was our server was pleasant, but never came back to check on us throughout the meal. I'd have liked a water refill and another beverage. Food was...blah. My wife asked for her chicken blackened, and they burn it.  My pig wing dinner wasn't anything special.  Portion sizes were decent.  Decor was pretty cool, and their setup was good. They need to do something unique, though. I could see a smoker or BBQ on the patio...but something is needed to pump this place up.  So many places have folded in this space...Haymaker needs to do something soon so that it doesn't follow their footsteps."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 4 times--2 lunches, 1 dinner and 1 breakfast.  I have had the pulled pork (excellent flavor), the AZ burger (wonderful with a touch of spice from the green chilis), the pork shanks  with marmalade sauce (out of this world) and huevos benedictos with chorizo and chipotile cream sauce (excellent with a nice back bite of spice).  The service has been great everytime.  I am so glad this place opened in Goodyear."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time about 2 weeks ago.  The fried pickles are to die for.  Service was friendly and prices were good.  It wasn't overly crowded on a Friday evening.  We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The menu at this restaurant features all types of burgers, sandwiches, entrees, and even serves breakfast all day. I tried the Buckwheat pancakes, which I love, but they aren't always the easiest to find.  While the flavor was good, they were a little dry.  I also tried the scrambled eggs and potatoes.  These were good.  The atmosphere is casual and is similar to an Applebee's or a Chili's."}
{"text":"Anytime you see a line you know you got something. Hostess was friendly and the waitress was friendly and efficient. Food was solid and served at the correct temperature. The waitress was open to substitutions and made us feel welcome. All in all well done. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday yesterday with a group of 12 of us. We called ahead and by the time we got there they already had the patio set up and we were seated right away. All 12 burgers came out within 15-25 mins, and the table went silent as everyone couldn't believe how good the food was. I had the cardiologist and it was amazing. THE BACON WAS SO GOOD. Could use more mustard but it was awesome. My bill was $37 with mine and my wife's meal and I also had two bloody Mary's. we didn't know about the military discount but the food was surprising cheap enough I'm not even upset we didn't get the 20% off. Wort the go."}
{"text":"Well they re-designed just this location.  Went there because they advertise happy hour 7 days a week in a coupon we had.  Well not anymore at just this location.  Changed the menu-don't like it-won't be back.  This is now a Sports Bar and they place rock music and have billiards, etc.  The food we had was good but menu selection was VERY limited.  Off our list now--there are other locations that have happy hour seven days a week and they will get our business."}
{"text":"Tonight, not so great. Arrived around 8pm to a fairly full restaurant. Decided to sit at the bar. No welcome the from bartender as he walked around. Finally he took a drink order. Served drinks & did not bother to wipe up our area & placed our drinks in the former diners aftermath. Continuing to get ignored as he chatted with neighboring patron, we paid for our soda with cash & alerted the hostess to our dismay."}
{"text":"I love supporting local businesses and love Luicidi distillery. I knew that this restaurant was owned by the same people so thought we would give it a try. This restaurant has the very typical stick to your ribs diner type food. I had the blt with the fried green tomato and Texas toast. This was a cheat meal for sure and not something I can eat on a normal basis. However if I am in the need for some down home comfort food I would go again. Also, our server was very attentive without being annoying. They also have some cocktails that use the Luicidi alcohols, which is a nice touch."}
{"text":"First time visited here and my wife and I loved it. Prices were really reasonable and the service was great. I would highly recomend this place if you're seeking a nice casual comfort food restaurant."}
{"text":"Great customer service, fantastic food! Try the Cardiologist and if u need more hair on your chest get the Double! Will definetly be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the mood for a good bar burger and decided to try this place. It was amazing! The burgers were big and juicy and there was a variety to choose from. Our server, Corey, was friendly and knowledgeable and we had great service. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time here, I was a little disappointed. I took my daughter out for dinner. I think the food could have been good if it didn't sit under a light for to long. I had the patty melt and my daughter the sirloin steak. I don't want to blame the cook cause it looked and tasted alright but we did wait for our food a little longer than we should have. I paid the 33 bucks but won't be coming back. Oh yea if the server wanted to know why I left no tip that's why. I don't tip for warm to cold food."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! Went on New Year's Day around 4 with the family. Had a slight hiccup with a chicken sandwich but everything was quickly taken care of. Kudos to the staff"}
{"text":"Food is good, just pricey for breakfast food. 13$+ for pancakes, 1 egg, 1 sausage and hashbrowns. Outside the price great service and food."}
{"text":"Great place to have a drink and hang out at the bar, big selection on beers. Its also a great place to take your family. We went there for lunch and our waitress Jeanine was awesome! Everyone there is great!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food.i had French dip. Pretty cool interior. Waiter was quick and friendly. Not too loud or expensive. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Nothing made me say wow but everything was good. Good service and recommendations (had an 805 beer and Texan burger), wife had pulled pork (better than mine and mine is good), daughter had wings... great bbq sauce and son did French toast... he lived it...    like I said everything is good, you can't go wrong here ... enjoy!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!!! Service isn't stellar but they are packed! I had the chicken fried steak and the hubby has fish n chips! Great news..... Bum bum bum bum.... They have good ranch!!! Now that is a hot commodity out here!!!! My steak was great and Chris loved the fish!!! I highly recommend this place! Next to McDs on Happy Valley and Lake Pleasent!"}
{"text":"got a hamburger with avocado on it and frys, my frys were cold and my burger was very dry. the avocado was one tiny piece for an up charge that was way too much. won't be going back"}
{"text":"Just moved here and have ventured here several times. Crystal is an outstanding server and very personable,  and Ryan is an outstanding manager. My family and I always look forward to the great service and food they provide. You won't be disappointed. Trust me."}
{"text":"Awesome food, excellent service, and a surprising attention to detail you rarely see in the restaurant industry."}
{"text":"We eat here @ 2x's a month and think that the service and food is very good. People are very friendly and make you feel 'at home.'  Biggest problem that we have is that when we eat there with friends, it is not possible to easily get separate checks,  They enter the orders per table/seat, not per customer.  This needs to change because the servers are then left to try a figure out and explain individual bills.  This is very awkward both for the customer and the server. It simply is not fair to the server.  If this were not an issue, I would give the place 5 stars.  We really do enjoy the food and service."}
{"text":"Went there a couple of weeks ago for dinner with my wife and step-daughter.  I've been there before and had the salmon dinner.  It was good, not great but good.  We went in the late afternoon.  We were seated at a booth that had the afternoon sun shining, no, not just shining but BEATING down on us and it was directly in my eyes.  A minor annoyance really but I had to wait about 20 minutes to get someone to lower the blinds. (UPDATE - 05/19/16:  Now that I think about it, there may not have been blinds to even lower, I would have to go back in to verify this but the problem was eventually resolved by the sun setting lower)  In the meantime, I had to have my stepdaughter sit very very still across from me.  Every time she moved, I felt like I was in one of those X-men movies and someones mutant powers had gotten loose and temporarily blinded me.  Our server, was good but he seemed to be the only one that had an abundance of tables.  Most other servers were casually walking around, paying lots of attention to their tables.  Our server was practically running between tables and of course, our table wasn't anywhere near his other tables so there were a few times we had to wait and wait and wait for him to come back and take our order or get us drink refills.  On to the food.  We all opted for burgers of some sort.  I had basically the southwestern bacon cheese burger (I don't recall the exact name) and both my wife and I opted for the gluten free bun.  It was tasty, and very large.  The gluten free bun was better than average.  I rarely can't finish an entire burger but both my wife and I had to stop after half a burger.  My only complaint was my order of medium came back medium well, or barely pink.  That's not a huge issue for me as long as it's not boot leather well done.  It was still good but I think it sat for awhile because the bun was saturated and I had to resort to using a fork and knife to eat it or I would have been wearing more of it on my shirt than I would've gotten into my mouth.  Anyone that has had gluten free bread / buns of any kind will know that the gluten free does not hold together as well as normal bread or buns.  Add that factor to the saturated aspect and the bun was essentially worthless for containing the burger and the rest.  The fries were good and a nice serving size.  My wife had some sort of a fungus, ok fine, a mushroom burger.  She enjoyed it immensely but hers was also medium well.  She also ended up ditching most of the bun and using a knife and fork.  Her sweet potato fries were very good, as evidenced by her eating all her fries before even touching her burger.  All in all, it was good.  I will probably be back but not for quite awhile because there are so many options out there I want to try first."}
{"text":"So... Let me just start off by saying that this was THE MOST PLEASANT dining experience I've ever had. And I've dined at some extremely nice restaurants. I totally wasn't ready for it. I wasn't expecting it to be this great. I wasn't expecting it to be bad. But ... Not THIS great. The food was good, there is no denying that. We started off with the pineapple habanero and sweet chile wings, then my husband had the Texan Burger and I had the buffalo chicken sandwich. The wings are STELLAR, and the burger and sandwich were enjoyable also. But, what really made this experience memorable and fantastic was our waitress. Her name was Ree. She was  personable, knowledgeable, oh so humorous, and you know what? I could really tell she loves the restaurant that she was working for and was happy to be at work. She was hilarious and on top of everything. Employees like her give Haymaker that \"wow\" factor. I was so impressed by her. We will be returning and for sure will be asking for Ree!"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. The food is fantastic and I love they have a decent gluten free option. I often get the steak sandwich and it's delicious. The kids will get the a grilled cheese on gluten free bread and they eat every bite. I wish their wing sauce was bit spicer but that's just my opinion."}
{"text":"Was this past 2 Saturdays and it seems that the service has declined. Food was cold. And it took 1 hour to get our food and it wasn't even busy. Were on the lookout for a NEW BREAKFAST SPOT. I recommend the 40th st. Cafe"}
{"text":"mmmmmmmmm... not that great this morning. Ordered steak and eggs.. i like eggs well done. Over well.. no gelatinous yolky goo.. unfortunately, despite communicating this desire, the kitchen staff could not pull it off with the existing hardware. Steak was done correctly, ordered medium rare, but lacked flavor, other than seasonings on the steak itself. toast was cold, potatoes we also cold.. My son ordered huevos rancheros, which arrived with a  healthy dollop of sour cream, even though he asked for no sour cream.. hey, at least they got the no avocado, right? To their credit, they were pretty busy.. Not going to write them off, yet.."}
{"text":"Just walked out after sitting at my table for 10 minutes and no one even greeting me.  Would love to say it's the first time it happened but it's not.  The service is normally bad or the kitchen can't get the orders out correctly.  So, you may ask why I went back?  Well about 6 months ago they comped our whole meal and gave us a $25 gift card.  I figured I'd try on an off hour.  It's all the same no matter if they're busy or not.  As a server, bartender and someone who's managed a restaurant before there's no excuse for not greeting a table within a 10 minute window.  I saw 3 different servers walk by me.  There was also a booth across from me who complained to the hostess that they too hadn't been greeted so they asked to move but instead she went and got them drinks so they'd stay."}
{"text":"Update: I just had to give them 5 stars again!!! I've been here a lot since my first great experience and it has not let me down. The menu is not huge but they have the best bbq ribs and burgers around.  The bar and wait staff are awesome. It's definitely my favorite place in town for family dining, happy hour AND date night. I heard the breakfast is great too! This is a must try."}
{"text":"Reviewing this place AGAIN! And guess what, nothing has changed. I give this place 1 star cause it's the lowest allowable. I'm not sure why this location (Haymaker, formerly Caballeros, and before that MCarthys), always has bad service!! I think it's been all diff owners, but it's always disappointed me in regards to service. The food is basic, service horrid. Rude hostess, waitress had no knowledge of menu)."}
{"text":"We had dinner here tonight because a couple of previous visits have been pretty good.  The place was busy and we sat at the bar.  The bartender was overwhelmed, not because it was overly busy but because she sucked!  Yup, I said it.....  She greeted us and proceeded to walk past us three or four times without taking our drink order.  Dirty glasses everywhere and the bar was trashed....  FILTHY....   The bartender finally took our order and we had our drinks after that but there was zero sense of urgency that's for sure.    It came time to order and I had the \"wrangler\" while my beautiful wife ordered the Salmon entrée and then we WAITED......   and waited...    Note to wait staff..  How about using serving trays...   I don't really like my plate squeezed up against your shirt and cleavage....  Just sayin...    My wife's Salmon was good as reported by her and my salad that I ordered with my dinner was pretty good...  Burger cold and not worth the price.   We finished our first round of drinks and placed them on the rail of the bar (a subtle signal that we might want more drinks).  The bartender passed back and forth and finally asked if we wanted more drinks... Dinner was over $50.....  Not that its expensive but you would think we would get good service and value for that price.     To the owners of the Haymaker:  People work hard and want to come to a play to relax and have a nice experience.  In addition, people are tired of bad service and food in the Goodyear area and that is the reason that your business is the third or forth at this location.  Cant ya do better than this???  If you want to know what good service is like in our area, go to Carabbas.  If you want to know what good bartenders are go to Native Grill...    I hope you are successful.  We need more choices for places to eat and drink around here, but I can tell you that you wont survive if this continues.    If you don't believe me, read my reviews and count all the places that are closed from bad food and service."}
{"text":"My new favorite spot!  BBQ is pretty tasty!  For food- we got the piggy platter & fried zucchini.  For drinks, we got a Georgia Peach and Apple Ale (cocktails)- EVERYTHING was great!!  Fast and friendly service.  All American country style restaurant on one side, bar on other. Also 20% off for military!  God bless this place!"}
{"text":"We visited here for breakfast and I enjoyed the buttermilk pancakes. Everyone was very friendly.  Can't speak for the other meals but for breakfast it was very good."}
{"text":"I have given this place a second chance and they disappointed me again, i will not return here.  My friends in the area have said the same thing but thought i would try them again. This tume i brought my entire family and waited for over 30 minutes for breakfast as soon as we sat down they inform us breakfast is no longer served as this is why we were there. Pretty much said have a nice day as i was mad since they should of told us this before we waited and wasted our time here. Not worth going here anymore."}
{"text":"Fun place waiters an waitress are nice....Food is average at best ......Notice alot of drinks sold both times there was around 10am.... Maybe it's more bar than restaurant"}
{"text":"We visited with a group of 9, We have been there before and the food and service was great. This time not so much. It started with the lady at the front when you walk in, she seemed annoyed that we would bring such a large group in. When we were seated our waitress was pleasant but overall the service was slow. They were not able to bring our food out all at the same time, so the first 4 people got theirs then 5 mins later the next 4 got theirs, then finally the last person received part of their meal. He still had to wait on the onion rings he ordered. The food was just average...which is to bad because we like to visit the local non chain places when we go out but this one will be taken off the list."}
{"text":"We had a party of 11 people walk in about 11 am . Our server was very polite but very slow. I get that there is a big party you have to accommodate. There just seemed to be no urgency in getting our drink order to the table which took about 15 minutes. After taking the order we waited about 45 minutes for the food to arrive. The sever said there was a malfunction in the kitchen with the cook taking the order.  My wife ordered a Black Bean Burger with bacon on the side. Since she is a vegetarian she thought I would like her bacon. When the order finally arrived, my wife got a regular hamburger with the bacon nestled in the middle. Needless to say after waiting almost an hour for our party to eat, this just makes a bad experience worse.  The chef came out an apologized about the delay. We were given a desert coupon for the next visit. Nice gesture but that is not going to wash away the disaster that took place.  My advice, this place can not handle big parties so anymore than party of 4 go some place else."}
{"text":"It has good hometown cooking with a twist. It was great food. But, when you go in looking forward to a certain flavor (in my case chicken friend steak) and you get something that has an extra component that totally changes everything you've ever had before. It kinda ruins it for you. Even though it tasted good, it was totally not was I was expecting and craving."}
{"text":"Excellent service by both the waiter Whitney and a very kind manager who's name I believe is Manny. Had a great conversation with both. Lively restaurant with great service and food. I highly recommend the Texan burger along with the Hillbilly Lemonade. Definitely plan on coming back!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I have been here about 4 times now. The food has always been good and worth coming back for. Keep in mind that they're trying to capture the comfort of a neighborhood bar in one area. The only problem with that is the service has been less than a neighborhood bar which means you can get it if you can catch it and you usually get served by someone who wasn't assigned to your table because it takes awhile to figure out there's a new customer. At each of our visits, after our food was served, the wait help would ask the usual \"Can I get you anything else?\" After disappearing for at least 5 minutes after that, they either came back and forgot or brought something completely different from what was asked. Not once, EVERY visit. Good food. Servers could use a little lead."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant and my husband and I had an excellent meal.  My husband ordered the fish and chips that is served with tarter sauce.  Our server, Sean, went above and beyond and even made us cocktail sauce from scratch (his personal recipe which was delicious). Great food and excellent service.  Thank you Sean for treating us like family."}
{"text":"I normally have a hamburger when I go to Haymakers and they're pretty good. I didn't want a burger so I ordered the chicken and ribs! Big mistake! The worst meal I have ever had! I retired from the Navy, and I never had a meal that bad!!!!! The chicken was way over cooked and the ribs were so tough that I couldn't hardly cut them with a steak knife! And they served the meal on paper!!! I'm pretty sure I ingested some paper! I complained about the meal and they gave me half off my meal! Terrible food! Adding insult to injury, the beer was warm!!!! Never again Haymaker never again!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here with my mom for lunch not really sure what to expect... I was disappointed regardless. The service was basic and the food was mediocre. I just felt like I could've made the same food myself."}
{"text":"My family and I love Haymaker!  The food and atmosphere are wonderful! My husband loves the patriotic decor, as he is a veteran.   The employees are very kind and accommodating and the burgers are fantastic along with everything else we have had.  We are going back tonight and we could not be happier."}
{"text":"My family and I go to the Haymaker in Goodyear on Litchfield and McDowell.  We have never been disappointed in anything we have had to eat or the service.  We love it and are going again tonight!"}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast! Great coffee, food, atmosphere, and service. Bluegreen folks get a discount but prices are entirely reasonable, especially for the generous portions. Loved the patriotic theme....'Merica!"}
{"text":"Returned tonight.  Beer menu was back to normal--Ballast Point Grapefruit Sculpin IPA on tap.  Ahh, yes.  Service was top notch.  They had a waitress in training, so we were treated *exceptionally* well between the two of them.  Thank you, Rebecca and Kerrie!  Ask for them if you make It in!  Food was great and what we expected.  Wings, salad, steak sandwich and bread pudding.  It was all above par and incomparable to anything around us.  Actually, a venue like this really doesn't exist around here:  a sports bar with a family friendly atmosphere, but delivering food that rivals even the best of Old Town.  My wife put it this way:  \"The three B's of Haymaker's are undeniable: Beer, Bloody Mary's and Bread Pudding.\"  She's not exactly going to be the poster child for Hi-Health, but when you have fantastic beer choices and desert that rocks,  well, your high on everything other than health.  And, you just don't seem to mind.  Another review brought to you by me, Chris Birchby.  I know, who the hell is that?  It's just me.  A guy passionate about food and drinks when, well, he's had a few.  Cheers to you all!"}
{"text":"The service was good. Promptly to the table. Our order came out quickly and was cooked to order. The food was all very bland for burgers. Even the onion rings had very little flavor. Maybe we ended up on an off day or with a new cook?"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for lunch on a weekday.  It was fairly busy, but we were able to be a seated right away.  Drinks came out fairly quickly but the food did take about 25 minutes... for a tuna melt and a burger.  My boyfriend was impressed at the bourbon list and we will probably come back for the bourbon flight.  Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was just okay. Justice the hostess did help me find my way there and was very kind. Nicole told us all drafts were $4, she explained her favorite food and drinks. I ended up ordering the watermelon ipa and when we received the bill it ended up being $7. My friend ordered a half tuna melt but it came as a whole she said she'd adjust it but didn't. I ordered the Patty melt and subbed the cheese for pepper jack and 1000 island, but came without the dressing. I asked her for it 2 more times before receiving it. I had an entertainment coupon for a bogo entree and they said usually they don't give happy hour drinks with a coupon for food so next time we have to choose which deal. What? What does food have to do with drinks? After all the confusion a manager never came over."}
{"text":"The food is blan.  The menu is mediocre.  The service is definitely less than par.  I went to try it and it wasn't horrible, but there is nothing about this place that would make me want to go again."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that my husband and I gave this place a fair shot. We've been here 3 different times, once for breakfast and twice for dinner. I've ordered different items each time from the menu, and I have to say, they've all been just okay, nothing that I couldn't just make at home. I think they need to revamp their menu items and open up a fabulous patio and then if consider going again. Also the service has always been slow, sorry, I really wanted to like you Haymaker, especially since you're so close to where I live."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times.  Good bites, good brews, good service.  Beer: Haymaker represented Arizona Beer week well. Lots of local beer on tap.  Bites: Awesome ribs, good boneless wings, OK fried zucchini.  We usually have a big group with individual checks. Staff does a great job keeping it all straight."}
{"text":"Been here about 5 or 6 times.  Each time for LUNCH.  Their wings are pretty good.  If you like wing sauce and BBQ sauce mix, ask for Rhythm sauce--personally, I LOVE IT.  I throw it on my burger too.  Their Burgers are VERY good.  From other reviews, their breakfast is good, but I've never tried it.  Other people I went to lunch with liked their food.  It isn't amazing, but its good.  I would always choose HAYMAKER over Lakeside Bar & Grill."}
{"text":"Meh. Wasn't my favorite. The salad was weak for $10. The service was good once we finally got greeted. Not a terrible experience but also not the best. My friends wrap was pretty lame for the price too. I could've made better food at home for cheaper. Probably won't be returning anytime soon. The food lacks flavor and isn't very original. Oh well.   UPDATE: We went for breakfast and wow. We'll be back. Such great prices for the food we got. Great service and great home cooking. Can't wait to come back and try happy hour n dinner! If you like mimosas come here before noon! Only $3!"}
{"text":"This was a huge hit this morning for breakfast! Prices are reasonable and the serving size was generous! I enjoyed the Haymaker breakfast sandwich (sausage was tasty) and my husband had The Cowboy Platter)Everyone was friendly and I was even offered a coffee to go."}
{"text":"Eric was such a wonderful server! You must ask for him! We will definitely come back and request him for great service. Food was also awesome! Beer served in Mason jars"}
{"text":"Super impressed with how fresh my salad was. I ordered the strawberry and avocado salad and it was delicious. My strawberries were fresh and the avocado was ripe and not mushy or spotted."}
{"text":"Maybe it was the food, maybe it was the bar tender, maybe it was the booze... but I legit LOVED this place.  Stayed down the road for a long weekend over LDW and ate breakfast/brunch at Haywood every day.  Things I tried:  bloody mary, belini, some in-house beer, a biscuit (huge and wonderful), steak and eggs (cooked just right and very tasty), a breakfast sammie with turkey sausage (ended up being my favorite thing), and a handful of sides that were all good.  Trying all of these on consecutive days, it's safe to say I started to feel like a local.  Honestly, the bar tender made it even more worth it.  He was great to talk to and gave awesome suggestions for places to check out in Jerome and Prescott in our wanderings.  Skip waiting for a table (there always seems to be a wait of some duration) and just go straight to the bar."}
{"text":"2nd time, still not impressed by the food and the service is very slow and inattentive."}
{"text":"Yet again another SUPERB experience for dinner, Thanks Kati for the great service and big smiles... Dan shows his pation for the business and his customers and it emanates through out the rest of the team. Thanks again for everything."}
{"text":"My haymaker Benedict's presentation and freshness and flavor were great. However my wife's California omelette was overdone, came with fruit out of a can, and was less than impressive. Coffee was very good and service also good."}
{"text":"Great food and service!  I really like,the atmosphere here as well!  Its mostly a 30's and up crowd!"}
{"text":"At the recommendation of a local we tried the Haymaker for dinner. I had the French dip which was really good. My husband had the pulled pork sandwich. It was just ok. It was a little on the dry side with not much sauce at all. I had French fries and he ordered onion rings. He got 3 small onion rings which tasted good but really? Only 3? The French fries arrived later than my sandwich and again were a scanty helping. I would try this place again though. It had nice wait staff and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ordered their Arizona burger with regular raw sliced onion not grilled-Excellent. Service great."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in the Goodyear/Avondale area! I fell in love with it the first time I walked in and was immediately greeted like an old friend. The decor is awesome as well. The American flag, copies of many of our nation's historic documents framed and hanging on the wall, the Grace before Meals on another wall. It feels like coming home! So far I have not ordered anything off the menu that I was not pleased with. The staff are all well trained and courteous. When we go out, we always like to request our favorite waitstaff. At the Haymaker that is difficult because we love them all! Jonathan, Angela, and John to name a few! AWESOME servers! And lastly, The Haymaker is very military friendly. They offer a military discount, honor the military with free burgers at times throughout the year, just recently, they closed to the public for a Saturday morning and served free breakfast buffet to any active or retired military and their families. The Haymaker will be my first choice every time!"}
{"text":"Foods goodbut a bit over priced , happy hour has great prices. Service is so so at the bar."}
{"text":"Last week I had a \"Mom is on strike\" moment, so it was out to eat for us. We decided on Haymakers as they are a huge supporter of Liberty High School Football. I always try to frequent business that support the community.   I am so glad we decided to give them a try. Service was wonderful and we were happy to see the entire menu was available all day. Yea for breakfast for dinner. My husband had the Arizona omelette and I had the country fried stake. I'm not sure who was more pleased with their meal.   The atmosphere is perfect. It was so nice to go somewhere that you didn't have to shout over the music to be heard by the person next to you. My favorite little extra was a the rootbeer barrels as you left.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Great food, service is usually kind of slow. Awesome happy hour."}
{"text":"Haymaker could be the best restaurant within 10 miles of this area.  It is a American Bar restaurant.  The menu ranges from bbq, wings, and sandwiches, to salads, soups, and pastas.  It is a family owned establishment with a pretty impressive spirits selection.  The staff is very friendly and kind.  The prices are average with the fare.  I have had the fish and chips and they were pretty good.  Nice thick pieces of cod with a crisp non oily batter, small side of slaw, and a hefty portion of homemade fries. It was very good and a big enough portion for two adults to share.  Our waitress was Jill who was also the bartender and she was awesome.  I had several requests as I like vinegar and lemons with my fish and chips and she was on top of it.  I will be back and recommend them to others."}
{"text":"We have eaten there twice. The first time for dinner - pastrami and a spicy chicken sandwich with fries. The beer was served in a 32 oz mason type jar - hubby was happy with size and price. They have happy hour everyday not just weekdays. This morning went for breakfast we didn't wait to be seated either time and our server came over within 5 mins. The staff was busy, but everyone seemed to be happy and willingly to help out. They were friendly. We had better service this morning over dinner seemed like maybe the family was there to help not sure. Everything seemed to be made there so we'll be back as they get settled in."}
{"text":"Having twins, finding a place that feels comfortable to eat out is far and few between. Especially if you want a touch of quality to the food. Well, the Haymaker is it! Friendly and understanding staff AND patrons. We have had breakfast and dinner there, and really can't wait to try everything!"}
{"text":"Yep, I'm giving this place 5 Stars. I recently moved back to AZ, and this restaurant is near the office. Based on the Yelp reviews and it being within walking distance (if I wanted to walk) I drove over there to check it out.  Right away, I liked the feel. I mean, it was welcoming and stylish while still being simple and \"country,\" you know what I mean? I don't like fancy-shmancy places unless I'm out with my wife for some special occasion or something. Not for lunch, not by myself. But I'm not a fan of dives either. Haymaker's is just right.   The service was spot-on. I never had to wait to order a drink or my food, or for a refill, at the same time she didn't come around bugging me every 2 minutes to ask how my food was while I had a mouthful of it.  I had a burger and \"frings,\" because I felt like some onion rings but not too much... perfect balance in my opinion. The burger was great, cooked to order and delicious.   The prices aren't bad. I will make this part of my regular cycle of lunch stops, and one of these evenings I'll take my wife for dinner and see how that goes."}
{"text":"I have been to the Haymaker maybe five or six times. Each visit has been pleasant with consistent service. There is a full bar with a decent selection of microbrews. The menu is a step above bar food with a Western flare. The food is solid, but no culinary masterpiece. The pricing fits what you get. Breakfast is better than most and they can cook an egg properly which eludes most restaurants. The Haymaker is a better choice than Lakeside which is down the street. The dining room is always clean and tastefully appointed. I have no complaints and always feel that we get good value. Don't forget to snag a couple root beer barrels on the way out!"}
{"text":"Just celebrated a friends birthday lunch here. I was prepared with flowers for the occasion and wanted to support a locally-owned restaurant in the neighborhood.. I would have given it 3 stars, however I wasn't impressed when I was told that they don't do anything special for birthdays. It's one thing to not give a desert, but they can't even come out to sing and make the birthday girl feel special!? What's a girl go to do?"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in while vacationing in the area.  He enjoyed some of their tap brews that he had never heard of before, one being a black pale ale.  They have a large list of beers on tap.    We both had a house salad ($3.99, I think) and it was fresh mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, feta cheese & thinly sliced onions.  Very good house salad and great ranch dressing.  We shared the fish & chips ($9.95, I think) & an order of onion rings.  The fish was the best fish (of fish and chips) that I have every had.  Very hot, fresh, not fishy and had a great light breading.  We both liked the onion rings over the fries (chips).  Nice & friendly service and clean restaurant.  We would both go back if we were back in this area."}
{"text":"Love this place! First time here. .Has it all. I love the bourbon flights and their own rye bourbon is one of the best.  Will become a regular."}
{"text":"Came back and had the Fish and Chips. They were awesome and good portions! We also came in for breakfast another day and was pleasantly surprised. Had the Country fried steak with eggs and enjoyed it. Love having a place like this right down the road"}
{"text":"I completely take back my previous review. Haymaker is definitely a good place. Our breakfast was fantastic & the staff was good. I also LOVE how Haymaker gives back to their employees  (they're holding a benefit  night to help one of them out)  Visit the Haymaker - you will enjoy the laid back, comfortable atmosphere & delish food."}
{"text":"Can't say enough great things about the made from scratch clam chowder i just enjoyed.  Phenomenal!!!  Staff was tremendous.  Rest of the food was outstanding.  My first tome here and by far my last.  We will be here tomorrow to try the breakfast.  Angela was a great waitress and the 20% military discout is unheard of and truly appreciated.  Keep up the great work..."}
{"text":"This is our second time in the last month to eat breakfast, brunch. The food was fresh and delicious. As always, the service was great too. Although the dinner menu food can be a little disappointing if you come latter in the day, the food not as fresh, no place beats Haymakers breakfasts. We even got to sit at the bar and enjoy or food while watching football."}
{"text":"This is my first time here, so I'm not against giving this place a second try, eventually. But for my first time, the service has been horrible. We have waited a little over 30 minutes to order which is just too long. Our waitress wasn't around often, and one one the people in our party asked for a water FOUR (4) TIMES ! She eventually went to the bar to get her water herself. My friend and I ordered the macaroni and cheese. There is an option of types of cheese, and at first I thought my choices is what caused the blandness of food, but my friend chose different cheeses and her meal was just as bland.  Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals. Two people in our party got the blackened catfish and they enjoyed their meal.  In my opinion, the wait staff needs to be more attentive to their customers and needs to be either letting us know the food will take longer to cook, or get the order in right away."}
{"text":"Breakfast on a Saturday morning was surprisingly not busy. My wife's choice was better than mine, the Haymaker Benedict; scratch made fried chicken and bacon served over mashed red potato's under a cheese omelet covered with a real tasty chipotle cream sauce with leaves of fresh sauteed spinach, I call it an a A+ in my book. I had the Country Fried Steak and eggs. The eggs were cooked to perfection, I'll give their sausage gravy a C, it was made with water instead of milk so not nearly as creamy and the sausage bits were very mild so it wasn't nearly as tasty as the Horseshoe Cafe in Wickenburg. I give the chicken fried steak a C+, it was tender and a decent size and hand made but not nearly as good as what TexAz Grill on Bethany and 16th St serves up. The fried potatoes tasted and looked like they were the typical prepackaged type, ehhh. The biscuit under the steak I'll give a A+, it's rare to find biscuits as good as Mike & Rhonda's \"The Place\". They had $3 Bloody Mary's, they were served in a short low ball glass instead of a traditional tall high ball glass, they need to add some garnish like a couple olives other than a simple lime slice, but it was spicy and very tasty. Over-all this is a good place, especially the support they give to the veterans and police/fire departments. I can hardly wait to try their lunch and dinner items, they look soooooo good."}
{"text":"Tried out after a day at the lake. About 10 people dining area when we arrived, took approx. 10 minutes to get any service. Waiter came just as we getting ready to leave. Decided to order a drink and appetizer to see if service improved. Unfortunately it did not. The wings were delicious on a good note. Bloody Mary did not live up to description maybe because it was happy hour."}
{"text":"Always a great meal at the Haymaker!!  Great prices and superb food!!!  I always order the Country Fried Steak for breakfast, I always have to take half of it back home, I really recommend this dish.  My son loves the Pigs in a Blanket.  I have yet to see a dish I don't like there."}
{"text":"So, my wife and I tried this spot. It was fairly busy, so we expected some service slowdown. We were pleasantly surprised that wasn't the case.   The good: Our server. Man, he was moving. He did a really good job. We ordered the fried pickles and pulled pork sliders for the appetizers. We had the coroner, coronary, whatever the burger wit pastrami was. The fried pickles were the winner with the sliders.  The bad: The burger was meh. The pastrami and pretzel roll were delicious, but the burger was dried out and my wife noted that it looked pre-made. If this is a burger spot, then they need to up their game a LOT.   The ugly: Our table. First, I hate high tops, but it was all they had when I wanted to watch some football. That wasn't the point. The table seemed like it could tip over at any point in time as evidenced by the stacks of coasters underneath both sets of feet. At LEAST fix the tables.   Aaaaand the food didn't sit well with me at all. It was suitable, but my wife and I commented that it wasn't going to be a spot that we were going to rush back to any time soon."}
{"text":"Breakfast was great. Senior Menu available with big portions. Ordered the Arizona Omelet with a biscuit.  Possibly the best biscuit I've had. Huge and fluffy. Portions were big. Food was good. Waitress was very nice. Coffee was good, but they could use one of the good Local Roasters to make a better experience. They serve real cream, not those plastic containers of questionable ingredients."}
{"text":"Love this place! The REMODEL IS BEAUTIFUL!!!!! A new hip place for people to hang out, have a few drinks, shoot darts, play a game of pool and have some yummy food. Just reopened yesterday and we've been there twice. Keep it up Haymaker. We love you guys! Change is GOOD!"}
{"text":"Good experience.  They are kid friendly and have gluten free option including gluten free breads and buns"}
{"text":"It was odd to be not seated for a party of five when 3 sets of couples came right in to be seated.  If I did the math that is 6 people.  They said that their computers were down to handle a large party.  I call bs on that.  Too bad I liked the fried pickles."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. The staff was very friendly. The place was pretty full but not so full that we had to wait for a table. Order the pulled pork sandwich and it was great. Food came out quick and the prices are the same as a comparable place. Will be returning."}
{"text":"Absolutely solid breakfast. Pancakes are a winner corned beef hash is OK well the family liked breakfast no complaints.  Available  local newspaper to read. Coffee is good.  Price is very fair Service good waitresses are young don't necessarily know the menu but that's okay as long as they stop and simply said let me check with the manager I'm fine with thayd no crap no bs.   Family friendly restaurant and bathrooms are clean good place to go."}
{"text":"First off, I hate leaving such a bad review...  We've been coming to this place since it used to be McGraths. Loved Cabellero, after that. Now, Haystack or whatever.   We were seated promptly, which was nice, since my family is 6 members. Drinks also brought promptly. The waitress gave us the \"happy hour menu\" to which my hubby started asking what they had on tap. He had a couple samples before getting Sex Panther. It came in a weird 16oz mason jar, he really enjoyed it. I just had tea and the kids had water.   Later food was brought out, everything was good, tho my substituted salad didn't come with the meal, but the waitress brought it out when I asked. As we received the check, I gave it a quick check and noticed my salmon was $16.50 ($15.50 on the menu), I wasn't too worried about it till my hubby got back from the restroom and said his beer wasn't happy hour priced (7.00 is what they charged). When we noticed the waitress about the mistake, she said she would check on it and be right back. After about 5 minutes, she brought back the \"to-sign copy receipt\" and said that the salmon was up charged a $1 for the salad (not disclosed), then proceeded to say the beer my husband chose wasn't on the happy hour menu (also NOT disclosed). My hubby said well there NO beers listed on the happy hour menu and she DIDNT tell us it wasn't apart of happy hour, he also told her she should've told us. She replies, \"yeah, I should have. But these are the charges and your copy of the receipt is in the book. Needless to say, the \"up charges\" were taken out of her tip.   Kinda disappointed this is how things went down, we even had a nice chat with the manager, I think that's what she was anyway.... Unfortunately, given the events and just \"okay\" food I don't seeing us returning.  I'm gonna add a copy of our receipt so y'all can see."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service! The food was flavorful and tasted fresh. Service was efficient and atmosphere was lively and great for families or casual dining.  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Meh  I can imagine going here for the game, but breakfast with family is bit exhausting. First off, if your into watching tv during your meals, then you'll enjoy this place. I'm a bit old-fashioned because I like to talk my family during breakfast; that's pretty difficult with the sports blasting everywhere.   The service is hit-or-miss. We've had one guy who's a really great server and another who seems like special requests annoy the bejesus out of him.   Food. It's ok. I don't think I've had a single thing over the several times we've been there that has made me say, \"that was really good\".   Overall, it's a mediocre brunch experience that leaves much to be desired."}
{"text":"Mash potatoes fries , steak and hamburger and pudding were delicious! My husband loved it so did my child !!! He hates trying new food but this place was good, customer service is excellent feels like family but is classy. Perfect"}
{"text":"We love, love, love The Haymaker!  I was looking for a gluten free restaurant with options, and this is the best!  They take great care of those of us who have celiac disease.  They even serve our gf on a red plate, to make sure!  Their sweet potato fries are gluten free too, so I never go hungry.  Great service, friendly always. Our kids always know what to get us for Christmas, Mother's Day, and birthdays----- gift certificates for this place! Thanks, Haymaker!!!!"}
{"text":"Wife and I have been here a few times now. I have no idea how this place gets so many 5 star reviews. I think the decor must be fooling people into thinking this is a better restaurant than it really is.The food is not very good. Service is good for a busy place but it's no better than a Chili's or TGIFridays.   For a place that is so egg-centric on breakfast these are some of the worst powdered scrambled eggs I have ever had. The burger is just a dry, boring, frozen patty with no flavor and the bun was horrible. It just fell apart half way through eating it.   The fries were half cooked and just frozen fries from a bag. Fresh cut fries do not cost any more and are SO much better!   We got the fried zucchini appetizer and it was 8 pieces for $7! That's almost a dollar a zucchini. It was pretty good for frozen fried zucchini but come on, $7?   $23 for 2 beers was the breaking point. Never going back! $65 w/tip for lunch is nuts! If the food was better maybe but this is chain restaurant crap food. Not worth it..."}
{"text":"Food was great!  Service was excellent!  I got the Buffalo chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries and my husband got the arizona burger with baked Mac n cheese.  Yummy."}
{"text":"We ate here after a full day of paintball.  We were able to stuff our faces with the delicious drinks and plates from Haymaker.  The food packed the punch and was tasty.  The cheese fries were solicitous as were the fries.  I'm a breakfast guy so I got the steak and eggs.  They give healthy servings so be sure to bring your appetite!  A lot of menu options here, food for everyone!"}
{"text":"Food was good. I had French dip with a side of horse radish sauce. Hubby had a barbecue chicken salad. Both of us left full. Service was very attentive."}
{"text":"Wasnt anything more than average sports bar fare. Tired server, bored hostess. Food was ok but nothing to rave about. Decent prices."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with their breakfast, great Chorizo Eggs Benedict, chased it down with a nicely prepared Bloody Mary !"}
{"text":"Great new addition to the west valley and so far so good.  The food has been really good, nice sized portions and some different menu options.  Nice beer and whisky selection too!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing breakfast and service!!! Incredible burgers and fish also! We went twice in a weekend because the food is that great!! Also awesome happy hour specials & for football! The only thing I didn't care for were all of the kids in the bar area on a Sunday football day, it was a bit rowdy for kids to be around, but we will be back for sure"}
{"text":"A very friendly experience, good service, quick delivery of food, and the prices are reasonable. Their spinach omelet and chicken fried steak were excellent. I will definitely recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"our new favorite place! Quickly seated in the busy restaurant and sever welcomed promptly. Good Haapy hour even though my husband got a $2 beer. He ordered Big BBQ beef. He says the brisket is melt in your mouth good. I have French dip & Mac and cheese which I enjoyed. I food came in less that 10 mins. It was Wednesday Kids eat free so there were many families. The country music playing was relaxing. We can't wait to go try breakfast."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!  Always great customer service, and the food is amazing! Always a must stop for me when I come to Arizona."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for the first time tonight. Food was AWESOME and service was superb! Our servers name was September. She was very knowledgeable of the menu and answered all of the stupid questions we had like where their beef comes from. This place is super close to our house and we will for sure be back! So glad there is finally a good sit down restaurant close to home that gives good service! Thanks Ms. September, you're awesome!"}
{"text":"Excellent food day and night, also excellent whiskey and beer menus...everything is always cooked exactly right, service is great, only downside is that it's really busy for weekend breakfast because it KICKS ASS...if you don't mind the wait, this place is it! Great sports, great food, great service!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and awesome service! The Texan burger was fantastic as well as the French dip. We will definitely be back! David was very knowledgable and seemed like he really cared if we enjoyed our experience."}
{"text":"I like this place. I've been there three times now. And I believe I'll keep going. I got the salmon black and it was really good. And tonight I had the French dip it was excellent. Lots of TVs to watch your sports."}
{"text":"I stopped in with some friends and was pleasantly surprised to find out the restaurant is still thriving.  I did notice some new faces in management and that must be why.  Our server, Whitney, was awesome, and we were even checked on by Manny, the manager.  Food was great, service excellent, prices were decent.....what more can one ask for"}
{"text":"Walking in there is the pledge on the wall. Okay, pretty cool. Immediately we were greeted by the hostesses, who were very nice. As we were led to our table I couldn't help noticing the decorations around the place. It's very patriotic all around the place and pretty southern, overall the atmosphere makes it a very cool place to have some food.   We were there for brunch so I got the Benedict Florentine, and others got the Country Fried Steak and the Banana Pecan Pancakes. Everything was very good.   The pancakes came out without any bananas or pecans, but the person running the food was quick to apologize and get it fixed.   The service was okay. Our server forgot some of our drinks that we ordered and she seemed uncomfortable the whole time she was talking to us at the table.   They have the little root beer candies instead of mints and that was a great end to a good meal.   Will probably be going again to try out lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This place seems like it would be great but the food is only okay. Very greasy food and fries are fried in old oil. Seems as though they were fried twice to get them warm again. Breakfast pancakes are tough and not tasty."}
{"text":"Am i inpatient? Ordered our food as soon as we came in, (look at check in time) and i just asked \"where is my food\"... i get \"we are super busy today\". Did this place just opened? Its 1213 and im sitting on a booth next to bar, i see 6 open tables on my right. I truly hope management sees this review, its the number one pet-peeve of most consumers. Im def not returning! Oh look my food just arrived, just trash it! Oh and fyi I'm usually very patient."}
{"text":"Saturday night, and it's pretty dead. Other than the servers here we may be the youngest couple here at 7pm. Our waitress Taylor was a rockstar, but can't say much about the food. It's just okay.   Wife had the pork chop and I had the half rack of ribs. We did find out they are a big into whiskey here. May have to try that out sometime.  Overall it's very country western. Just not our style."}
{"text":"Not impressed greasy burgers, fried not grilled, craft beers tried 2 not impressed bitter blond, aftertaste ale"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times for breakfast which is great! Today we came at 2 pm and I thought breakfast was served all day only to find out they stop serving breakfast at 11 am. I was so bummed that I considered leaving but my husband was starving. So I look at the menu and find it very simple. Of course my foul mood wasn't helping. I decide to order the salmon on a bed of warm spinach and my husband orders the pulled pork sandwich.   My meal arrives and looks great. I took my first bite and couldn't believe it. It was amazingly good. They turned such a simple meal into a flavorful dish that immediately changed my mood. My husband thought his pulled pork sandwich was so good he insisted I take a bite. And that was great too!   Service was timely, friendly and accommodating. They quickly brewed a fresh pot of coffees for my one cup. Our waitress chatted with us and checked in with us.   With coffee, tea and 20% tip, our bill was $36. That's pretty low. I would have paid 45. The waitress shared that they will be expanding both menus soon. I look forward to it and most definitely will not limit Haymaker to breakfast option. Very impressed."}
{"text":"Just had the opportunity to visit this restaurant for the first time today. So sorry we had not stopped by before!!! From the minute we walked in the customer service was exceptional. Sorry I didn't get the name of the elderly gentlemen who seated us, but he had a terrific sense of humor. We were served by both Ashley and Javier. Talk about team work. If one was busy as Javier is their bartender Ashley jumped right in to refill our beverages immediately. These two individuals were absolutely terrific. And the food....wow!!  We both had the Pastrami Sandwich which was terrific. What we really appreciate about this restaurant is that they acknowledge all branches of services on their menu which you don't see that often. That is an added plus for us. This will be visited frequently by us as it now has become one of our favorites in Goodyear. You can't go wrong with the food and the price of their meals. What a joy!!!"}
{"text":"Ok so i was very hopeful this place was going to be good. Unfortunately it wasn't. Everything we ate tonight had absolutely no seasoning, the prices were way too high for food that was so bland. We tried to give it the benefit of the doubt we ordered an appetizer the chicken chili nachos which to me tasted like hormel chili on Day old Tostitos. I got the Texan burger which reminds me a lot of the whiskey River burger from Red Robin but minus the flavor. I also got the sweet potato fries that tasted like they came from a frozen bag.My wife got the onion rings. Four tasteless silver dollar sized rings that again tasted like they were ripped from a costco bag of frozen rings and heated in a microwave. But still we tried to give it the benefit of the doubt and ordered desert I mean who can screw up a brownie and ice cream right. Survey says Haymakers. So in review overpriced bland food. Luckily I had purchased a deal on Amazon local that gave us $30 towards dinner so we're out of pocket 19 bucks if I would've had to pay full price I definitely would've been a lot more disappointed."}
{"text":"Well there goes the 5 stars. Restaurant is now a sports bar. Menu is completely different. No more all day breakfast. No more mac n cheese side choice or fresh vegetables. No more grilled chicken dinner. Guess we won't be back and we are here 1-2 times a week and brought our business lunches here. I was the duchess guess someone else will be now. Can't believe it's been converted. Loved that it was close to home too. I can hear the people next to me complaining too. I don't understand why all new restaurants feel the need to have TV's all over the place and serve bar food. I really don't think the place is anymore busy then it was. It wasn't the food or atmosphere that was wrong before now but the help. The help was terrible. Idk, maybe I am being harsh but I am not impressed therefore I probably won't be back. I am debating on the stars too. For now I will leave the 3. Let me eat, I may change that. So after eating and feeling like Bar Rescue has run across this sports bar. I have to say the mac n cheese was better then before. The pretzel sticks not so much. I do want to say the manager who is new was terrific. Very nice and accommodating. So we will probably be back because of her. I will rate at 4 because the menu has changed significantly."}
{"text":"We just dropped in for a quick lunch I ordered the regular cheese burger & my hubby got the Texas burger. Both were a bit over burned including the bun, fries were not fresh & we waited 10 minutes for our waitress to bring us the check.  Place was empty so being busy was not an issue for the service."}
{"text":"Food was quite tasty and our server Shane was fantastic! Love happy hour and the wings and chili cheese fries. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food on point! Burger cooked medium rare just as ordered! Didn't know they changed the happy hour menu, so the manager brought us a plate on her! They are the bomb!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another chance. Unfortunately once again we walked out. I ordered coffee first cup was cold waiter made a fresh pot brought out a nice fresh cup of coffee but the cup had lipstick on it! I brought it to the managers attention he proceeded to tell us that he was letting the waiter go for the rest of the day because of the dirty cup. I was outraged how do you let the waiter go for the incompetence of your dishwasher? Answer we don't have a dishwasher! Will never return. Didn't even get a chance to try the food"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers, stopped in after reading others reviews.   Got the  Arizonan, hand pressed angus grilled to perfection, well done for me topped with grilled chili and onions with pepper jack.  No sauce needed perfect blend of flavors. You get your choice of sides about 8 different choices, fries ( regular, sweet, Cajun and fringes) rice, beans and a few more.   Nice clean location, family friendly and they can accommodate large groups.  Friendly staff.   They like their AC, so if you get cold you may want to ear long sleeves.   We all enjoyed our meals and we will be back."}
{"text":"This is like the Applebees of \"craft\" beer bars and screams suburbia but it is a decent place for North Phx. The food is bar food and seems like most of the items are in the freezer before being cooked. I visited once and thats all I need. The bartender was the best he was so friendly and amazing.  Seems like a great place to watch sports because they have a lot of televisions in the bar."}
{"text":"Our family used to go here a couple times a month.  They have revamped their menu and have taken off the one dish I enjoyed.  The sun dried tomato pasta.  The rest of the family likes the breakfast food.  Tonight I tried the buffalo chicken sandwich with frings.  When my meal arrived there were only fries and no rings.  Our meal had taken quite a while to come out even though the place was less than half full.  So I didn't want to hassle trying to get it corrected and the fries were pretty good.  I tried my buffalo chicken sandwich and they must have their own version of what buffalo sauce is but it had a sweet taste to it.  I had my wife try it to see if it was just me, but she too found it sweet.  So needless to say I didnt eat my sandwich.  I have tried other things there before discovering the pasta and they were all just ok.  So needless to say we will not be frequenting this establishment anymore."}
{"text":"experience was over all uncomfortable. Our waiter did not seem to have her head on straight, and kept forgetting things. a fellow server stared at us for a majority of the meal and continued to touch the plates on our table every time he walked by. i watched his hand touch the salad i was in the middle of eating! had to ask three different times for a cup of water. will not be coming back, get it together."}
{"text":"I didn't read any reviews prior to visiting, and I wish I would have. The venue was clean and has a rustic Patriotic/Christian theme. We were promptly seated, and the staff were all pleasant. The food was, however, nothing to write home about. I ordered the California Chicken Salad. The dressing and walnuts were great, but the salad was mainly iceberg lettuce. The chicken was rubbery and flavorless; I could not eat it. My date got the Wrangler Burger which was just ok as well. There are definitely better burgers in the valley.  As the menu is so limited, I do not believe we will be back."}
{"text":"For a locally owned business food is very good and service is good as well! The manager Mandy is very helpful and always willing to do whatever it takes to make sure you leave happy! Living right around the corner it is always an easy stop if I don't have time to make dinner. Everything is reasonably priced, definitely one to try if you're in the area. Make sure you ask for venessa as she is amazing!"}
{"text":"I give this restaurant 0 stars.. I would have to say this would have to be the worst place I've ever been to.  Our steaks were not cooked to the correct temperature our waiter kept pulling a disappearing act. When the manager brought back the steak that improperly cooked she was very cold and rude that got even worse when we had ber take away the second attempted steak as they took so long to bring it back out everyone in our party was done eating not to mention it was so tough I could hardly cook it. The bus boy came to the table and actually sat his bussing tub on the table as we were still eating. One the way out the door I stopped to talk to another manager who was also rude."}
{"text":"My new favorite place! Love the food and atmosphere. My favorite burger so far is the Texan with a side of frings (fries and onion rings).  If you're not wanting to eat in they also do a great job on to go orders! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Had the Haymaker Benedict while my wife had the traditional Benedict. Both were excellent! So happy to have this place close by. Service was great, Mimosa's were great. Will be coming back often."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Monday around 1:30. Our first visit and only a few people inside. We had a voucher from Amazon. Sat in the dining room and it was clean the seats are worn and torn so looked a little run down. The restroom was clean and (thank you) had toliet seat covers. We ordered the fried zucchine which was overpriced $7 for 6-7 pieces dumped in a bowl and were a frozen product and not much taste. I ordered the tuna melt with swiss cheese instead of american and had to send it back because it came out with american cheese. By the time I got the second sandwhich my sweet potatoe fries were getting cold. The tuna was on a marbled rye which was very dry don't know if it was toasted or grilled. Tuna was extremely strong like a cheap tuna and not like a nice mild albacore. Would not get this again didn't even finish it. Hubby got ribs which he said were cooked in the oven and sauce was ok and meat tender. Came with mac/cheese which was ok too but a little dry. The coleslaw was watery and tasteless. Got the bread pudding which was good had room for it since I didn't eat all of the sandwhich. Owner took the sandwhich off of our bill without us asking which was nice but I was not offered any other sandwhich by the server when I complained I did not like it. Not sure we will be back too many other places to eat at to put up with just fair food."}
{"text":"Big portions, good service. Food is pretty basic but an upgrade from Denny's or IHOP. I've only had breakfast so I can't speak for the other menu options."}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend this place for gluten free.  They have an extensive GF menu, including sandwiches on GF bread!  I had a TAB sandwich - turkey, avocado, and bacon.  The turkey was honey smoked, which I do not like as much as roasted turkey, but still a pretty good sandwich.  You can get cole slaw or fries with the sandwich.  They also have salads and other options. Also, I had no symptoms from cross contamination.  I will be going back with the kids since they have a variety of kids meals and seem pretty kid friendly."}
{"text":"Went there for happy hour and sat at the bar.  Food was okay but service was lacking.  The bartrnder rarely checked on us and it took 20 minutes just to get a drink and another 20 minutes to get the check after we had already asked for it."}
{"text":"My favorite new restaurant. So glad to have a \"bar\" (this is a family establishment, I've just been looking for a bar) in the area. I've been here roughly about a dozen times since they've open. I've had (let me start with a disclaimer that I don't consume a lot of salt, so the saltiness factor should be in consideration of that):  Pulled pork sandwich  - amazing. Though if you like your meat smothered in BBQ sauce, ask for extra sauce.   Sweet potato fries with Cajun seasoning. I thought they were so-so; a bit too salty for me. Wasn't really my cup of tea.  Sweet potatoes fries. Delish! Nice steak cut instead of the skimpy shoe string.   Veggies - nicely seasoned, can be salty. Quite yummy.   Blackened salmon - firm, well seasoned. NOT fishy.   My downfall of amazingness: The Chicago Burger. The August burger of the month. Bomb-diggity! Burger with onions, relish, banana peppers, cheese and I think tomatoes. Add BBQ sauce (I'm a sucker for BBQ sauce). Or add ketchup & mustard. Yummy!  Drinks: They have a HUGE assortment of whiskey/whisky.   I've had their Sailor Juice. Dangerously good. Lynchberg Lemonade also tasty. Though it can be a little tart. Ask about their shot of the month. For August: Basil Hayden. $1 shot of Basil Hayden.   Great ice tea.   Great service. Sal works the bar and is super personable. I enjoy going to a place where they know me. :)"}
{"text":"My first time here. Decided to go based on other reviews and I agree with what I read - mainly positive. The ambiance is very nice, but definitely a small space. I like what decor that I saw from the bar area where we were seated. We were there for brunch and were told it would be a 20 minute wait that turned out to be only 5 minutes since we opted to sit in the bar area. The menu is  diverse and everything is available at all times. Everyone enjoyed their food and it arrived in an acceptable length of time. We enjoyed a brunch cocktails while we waited and that is when a problem occurred. When a second mimosa was delivered and clearly not filled to the top of the glass by nearly 2 inches I requested that it be filled up just as the first one had been. This obviously pissed off the bartender as she came to our table and very rudely informed us about the exact # of ounces it takes to bla, bla, bla and if I didn't agree with how that was made then she can make it a double if we preferred. Really!?! I didn't need to hear any  of that!! Just make it the same as the first one instead of going out of your way to come to our table to rudely explain why you couldn't fill the cocktail to the top of the glass. This is why I give you 3 stars instead of 5. She continued to make us feel uncomfortable the remainder of our visit."}
{"text":"This place has a great environment, great service, and the food was flavorful and fantastic. I sampled a variety of dishes and everything tasted great. The haymaker benedict dish was particularly good. It is a nice place to take the family for breakfast. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We went here for brunch last Sunday while visiting some friends in Phoenix and it was amazing! The wait was almost nothing which is fabulous for a Sunday (probably because we go there before church let out).  First and foremost the portions are huge and the price is great! You definitely get a good bang for your buck!  Secondly, the food was great! The biscuit is to die for - it's huge and so flaky! I added butter and honey. My husband went for the apple butter.   Finally, the staff was great. Super nice and helpful. I felt like we had 3 different people helping us out which ensured that our coffee and water was always full!   We'll definitely be back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Always amazing food, and so many GF items that are delicious! I love coming here and being able to eat all my favorite foods because they have allergy friendly options!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the breakfast that my wife and I had on the morning of April 13, 2015.  My wife had the buckwheat pancakes, which she thought were excellent.  I had the two egg breakfast with 1/2 meat (ham in this case).  I received to very healthy portions of \"seasoned\" ham, cut thick and was more ham than I anticipated and it was delicious.  Additionally, I ordered biscuits and gravy.  Here's where my 5 star rating comes in.  The biscuit was huge and home made; the gravy was Southern-style having been mixed with sausage drippings, not the normal flour gravy you receive so often out West.  It was superb; I'd go back for the ham and biscuit and gravy!  The waitress was helpful, prompt but not over-bearing.  The restaurant facility is very open, nicely appointed, and lends itself nicely for a restaurant.  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Very poor food quality. The service was ok, but the food was gross, we didn't finish even half of our meals, and we felt sick the rest of the day. Every ingredient is cheap, including the ketchup. Overpriced, poorly made meals. Waste of time and money, wish I hadn't given this place a shot."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and pretty appetizers.  They have a decent draught list, but be warned: 16oz pint to them actually means 12oz mason jar. So you're going to pay 7 dollars for a small amount of beer."}
{"text":"Great food,  great service, good selection of craft beer and a selection of whiskeys the likes I've never seen in any restaurant.   The BBQ is excellent, better than many dedicated BBQ restaurants.   Try the fried pickles appetizer... they are amazing.   And to top off the meal, they have apple crisp and bread pudding desserts that are an absolute must to try.  I hear their breakfast is even better... can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The breakfast has the C team servers and cooks!!  None of my breakfast came out as ordered and when I questioned my male sever about it he raised his voice at me!  Lunch, on game days, is pretty good in the bar."}
{"text":"While dinners at the Haymaker have always been tasty and service good, this morning's breakfast for the 5 of us was lacking in a couple of areas. Eggs Benedict for two of was a huge disappointment. When your mouth is watering for the deliciousness of that gooey, runny middle you order Benedict for, and your eggs arrive cooked solid, you just can't help but be disappointed. The turkey breast on my Western Benedict (in place of Canadian bacon) was thankfully sliced thinly, but was extremely salty.   When our waitress stopped by to see if we wanted coffee refills, the two gentlemen at our table both said \"yes\" ... only one received a refill. When she again stopped by, at the end of our meal and asked how everything was, my husband pointed out that our Eggs Benedict had been overlooked on both orders. Crickets. Absolute silence from our server. I realize she didn't cook the eggs, but a bit of empathy goes a long way.   We'll try the Haymaker for dinner again, but I suspect we've had our first and last family breakfast there. Just not what I'd hoped for and come to expect from this popular local eatery."}
{"text":"This is now my new weekend breakfast place. We went on a Sunday before the after church crowd. We were seated pretty quickly. One sad thing was that it took a bit fornthe server to come over. We did notice a sign that they are currently looking for servers. We ordered tea and coffee. Well... watch out for the dishes to be clean. There was leftover lipstick on the glass. The issue was corrected, slowly, but we took in consideration the staff shortage. The  breakfast we ordered was awesome.  Huge plates. They cooked the eggs correctly and paid attention to the special requests we had. Their prices are really good for the amount you get on your plate.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I really like this place. My boyfriend and I have been here twice; once for breakfast and once for an early dinner. Both times were great! Not only is the food fantastic but so is the service. We have had great waitresses both times, and they were very good to us m, making sure that we had refills, that the food was good, etc. My boyfriend had the pulled pork sandwich this last time and he said their BBQ sauce was outstanding. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"We went to The Haymaker for the first time tonight. Our server Kelsie was very good. She did an excellent job with getting what we needed. She was also very knowledgeable of the menu. Both my wife and I went simple with a couple burgers. My dad ordered the cod. I felt the food was pretty good. I liked the sweet potato fries and Cajun fries as well. The atmosphere was nice.  I like how they have several televisions up on the walls similar to a BWW set up. They also have a nice bar section that I wouldn't mind checking out another day. That will require a night without kids and a taxi."}
{"text":"Had a Groupon chit.  Ordered the chicken fried steak.  It was like it came out of a cafeteria.  Mediocre.  Service was good, however.  Manager apoligized for my disatisfaction. I'll give it another try since it is nearby."}
{"text":"The Haymaker is my ultimate breakfast spot. It's a homey vibe, plus a full bar. This is, of course, only second to how delicious the food is. You can order anything on the menu and be delighted.   The service here is next level. I've never had a bad encounter and everyone treats you like regulars (even if it's your first time there). Riley, specifically, is one of the sweetest girls and is just really on her toes.   10/10 recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have stopped by a couple of time.  Quick lunch, covered.  A great burger, got it.  A bowl of chili, oh ya!  Maybe just a salad today, yes, you can!  Breakfast, Lunch, dinner, a beer!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has great service and great food with a variety. A place you can come to when no one can agree on the food type because they have a little of everything. Today I had the Arizona omelet, delicious."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, reasonable prices.  What more could one ask for.  I have not had anything bad here but my favorites are the breakfast sandwich and Texan burger with frings."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Made the mistake of wanting to go out to breakfast on a holiday weekend Sunday. Good Call. All the restaurants around were crazy packed, and I'm sorry, but when this girl gets late breakfast, everyone suffers. I can't help it.  I wasn't looking forward to breakfast a bar/grill, but dang, I was hungry and they looked good enough.   The atmosphere is cool. The brick is a nice touch. Not too much, but a cool, neighborhood bar feeling. Like cheers, but current, a hint of American pride and rugged manliness, and with delicious food.   Unfortunately, I'm writing a little after the fact, but I do remember the portions were big, the price was reasonable, coffee was great, and our server was TOP notch with the coffee refills. I HATE EMPTY COFFEE CUPS. Coffee does nothing for me, except make me happy, so I can probably drink a gallon, don't judge, just refill my mug.   We will definitely be back here the next time we are in Phoenix. And I will update with better details."}
{"text":"There were six of us that were at the Haymaker this morning at 8:30 a.m.  I apologize that I cannot remember the name of the server, but she was great!  We were seated in the bar area, and she was very attentive.  Coffee was served as soon as we arrived, and refills were offered before the cup was even half empty.  The food came out in a timely manner and all six of our plates came at the same time.  The waitress explained that the country potatoes are vegean, being cooked in a pan with olive oil.  They were wonderful.  I will definitely come back for breakfast."}
{"text":"I think this restaurant deserves a second chance so we will probably give it another shot since it is in our neighborhood. The service was excellent here. The food was just ok. I had a crispy chicken sandwich and found it to be lacking. It needed something. The bread seemed like they toasted stale bread...I picked most of it apart. With no sauce it was dry and a bit bland. The fries however were quite tasty. My son ordered the lariat burger and liked it which says a lot coming from my picky teen. My husband had the buffalo chicken sandwich and found it to be ok but not as good as Chompies. They seemed to have a large beer selection so perhaps we will give it another shot one night and grab a beer."}
{"text":"Menu- many choices Food- delicious, we had pulled pork BBQ and ribs, both delicious Service- super!  Waitress was cheerful and efficient Facility- clean, nicely decorated Repeat visits- we have enjoyed breakfast, lunch and dinner there, will definitely return Pricing- reasonable"}
{"text":"The first time we went it was decent so we  gave it another shot yesterday. The food was awful, the eggs tasted like they came out of a carton, the hash browns were obviously frozen, and the chicken fried steak was burnt and the gravy was like brown water. We won't be back, and our search for a good breakfast spot continues."}
{"text":"Food is decent here but service is horrific.  We waited 20 minutes for drinks asked for refills and waited 10 more minutes with empty drinks.  I asked for a drink to go I never did get.  Understaffed or inappropriately staffed for the needs of the business.   Server was scatter brained and not attentive."}
{"text":"Great place. Food is great. Help is fantastic! Happy Hour is ridiculously great. Great prices.  You can't ask for anything more!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love the Haymaker.  GREAT selection of GOOD beer and their burgers are amazing.  We always sit at the bar and are never disappointed as the bartenders are always nice and friendly to everyone that sits down.    They always seem cool letting me customize my burger and when you go enough they remember your order.  I love getting the gringo burger with the amazing black bean patty on a pretzel bun.  Add some of their delicious sweet potato fries or get the fries with Cajun seasoning!"}
{"text":"I have to give Haymaker five stars as a family restaurant.  My wife and I have been here a number of times and have always been impressed with the friendly service and the quality of food.  Haymaker isn't going to be your upscale restaurant, it is going to be that place you can go to that feels like home, the place where they make you feel as if you are part of the family.  My wife and I were there on burger night, which you get a discount on the price if you order two hamburgers.  You aren't going to get better burgers in the valley, at  least from my experience.    After reading other Yelp reviews, I have to say I am disappointed that Michael M. can criticize an establishment without clearly explaining what the problem is or to make a claim that an establishment is \"white trash\" because the servers wear \"racist\" shirts.  It is hardly responsible to make a claim that something is racist without explaining exactly what was racist in nature about the shirts.  I have no doubt that whatever Michael M. felt was racist was more the result of an overactive attitude of political correctness than the management of Haymaker being less than sensitive. It is this kind of review that diminishes the integrity of Yelp in general.  There is nothing wrong with giving a review that shares honestly what the experience was as long as the review is one that explains completely what the experience was.  Why should an establishment be labeled racist without the reviewer clearly delineating what he felt was racist?  Simply irresponsible reviewing as far as I am concerned."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh,  this is such a great addition to the west valley. Great atmosphere, great food at a great value.  Very family friendly and management seems to be eager to ensure that your experience is top notch.   Breakfast was crowded so we went back for lunch and glad we did.  The Texas Burger was excellent as was the pulled pork. Looking forward to returning to try the other items as they all sounded good.  Restrooms like the rest of the restaurant were very clean. My parents and I were very impressed and plan to return often."}
{"text":"What a find in a retail area.  This place is ahhhhhh-mazing!!!  It was all we could do to get our friends in the door trying to enjoy all the paraphanalia on the walls. We were seated right away by a very pleasant hostess.  The service was awesome, as well as the food. Our waitress was Jessica who checked in with us constantly.  We were never wanting for anything. As soon as one of us had a halfway empty glass she was there to fill it up or check on \"more from the bar.\"  Guys like to make sure they never get empty. LOL It's nice to know we have a local place to go where we feel appreciated and know we get top knotch service. We want to try everything on the menu. We will be back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now for breakfast. This morning I went with my wife and baby boy. They provided a sling which was is always good. Both times now the food has been great. The picture attached is the Haymaker Benedict. It was delicious. Although my wife pointed out, it's like they took a dinner meal, threw an egg on top and called it \"breakfast\" haha."}
{"text":"We went there for breakfast shortly after it opened and recently for happy hour.  The food is good and the servers were great.  There is a good selection of beers from local breweries as well as Ca and Co.  We enjoyed sitting at the bar.  The bar tender was quite knowledgeable.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! My husband and my daughter and I ride our bikes here probably once a week. The breakfast is awesome, the benedicts are the best! Sal at the bar takes good care of us every time! Any game you want to see, it's on there even college baseball we've gone to watch. This is a regular go to for us!"}
{"text":"Visited tonight for the first time and will definitely be coming back!  Our server, Javier, was awesome. Super informative, honest, friendly, and prompt. I wouldn't want another server if returning to this location! Food is bomb, atmosphere is ice, and drinks are cold.  Go check it out, folks!"}
{"text":"Yum!! Great food, plenty of menu options. It is a great hang out spot. It kind of reminds me of a Yard House.  I like their salads that you can order as a wrap. Their sweet potato fries are DELICIOUS, possibly the best I've ever had. Service is usually decent. We will definitely keep going back."}
{"text":"331 reviews...  You guys don't need my bull.   Obviously they're doing something right, and if it's just the whiskey, that's cool. Make your money boo-boo.   I would say that my barometer of food is all over the goddamn place.   So little discrepancy, were forgiving by the absolute love love for the midnight service team--talking Jaw-jacking, enjoying your fucking day because they knew there was only one more hour of work left, and shit can't last forever.   Bigs heads up to our server, I forget her name, but she made this place better.   Tired, beaten, broken and bleeding ... but you couldn't have seen a bigger smile.    Cheerio, chic. Really I'm giving you these stars."}
{"text":"This was our first time at the haymaker and it was AWESOME! From the host to the food and service. It was all exceptional! Javier was our sever and he was the nicest, kindest most personable person. He was so good at his job. You could tell he loves working at this family restaurant and was so knowledgable about the history of this establishment. When we return we will request him, although all of the employees were so upbeat and friendly. If you want a new favorite restaurant, this is it! They have 3 locations!  Thank you for a memorable night! Javier should be a manager in my opinion, he's got what it takes!"}
{"text":"My wife and I discovered this place a few weeks ago and enjoyed it quite a bit. Last weekend they rebranded. It went from a restaurant feel to a bar feel, and the menu matches. They also went from a list of about 40 whiskeys to less than 10. Food sounded good but was bland across the board. We started with a waitress that was cheerful, and pleasant. They were so slow that she got sent home after taking our drink order. The waitress that took over came to our table to drop off the drinks and take our order, bring our food, and the \"how is everything\" about 2 minutes after. I waited about 20 minutes with an empty glass, wanting to order another beer. She finally brought the check instead. Oh well. Not saying we won't come back, but I will be surprised."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! The biscuits are huge and have great flavor. Pancakes were fluffy. Overall everything was delicious, and the service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"After having the worst experience of my dining life at Romano's Macaroni Grill my family and I walked next door to The Haymaker Restaurant.  We explained that we were in a litte of a rush to get my 4yr old grandson some food right away.    The waitress was extremely friendly and helpful as she took his order and got his food out right away.  He received his food in a very timely manner and was very happy to be eating.  The food was great.  The waitress was very attentative and friendly.  My family enjoyed themselves and we recommend this restaurant.  DO NOT GO TO ROMANO'S MACARONI GRILL next door.  You will be very disappointed.  You have been warned."}
{"text":"Updated  Have been back numerous times. Food is great but service continues to be an issue. They are friendly but slow. Difficult to get refills and have a timely meal. I've been quite happy because I only go when I'm not in a hurry and don't mind waiting and waiting.  Beware if you get put in the back end of the bar. It's rough getting service there. Hope they get back on Door dash as we loved getting delivery from them.   Had been wanting to try this place since it is in the neighborhood.   Pros Menu has many options and fun variations. The BLT includes avocado and fried tomatoes. Yummy Looks like they have an interesting whiskey menu-they had some unique options The person who sat us was friendly and gave us the impression that service would be great even though he had no idea if they had Hudson Baby Bourbon and did not check   Cons We were told when we sat that Kristen or a similar name would be right over-well there was a girl in the bar watching all the other tables and she never came. Made direct eye contact with us repeatedly but never bothered to see if we needed service. We were in her area and clearly had nothing (no drinks, menus, etc. After 20 full minutes we were able to grab a waiter from another area and see if he could get us menus, drinks and take our order. He was very nice and said he would get us started and find \"Kristen\". Again she never arrived so we asked the guy if he could help us. He did and gave us great service. I would have told someone as I left but I couldn't even figure out who to tell.   The food was good but I prefer to have some service as I can't take my own order into the kitchen. I did figure out the whiskeys once I got a menu. Service is a real issue here. The bartender seemed to be talking to a table of her own friends and that is why she was unable to serve us.   I would have given the food 4 stars, the menu would have gotten 5 stars but when service is that bad, I just can't do it. Will I try again?  Not sure"}
{"text":"Great little find... Off the beaten path. I had the California Omelette - tasty. Hubby had The Haymaker Benedict, delicious too! Service was ok, bit of a wait"}
{"text":"This is a decent option for a local, American meal, but in comparison to many other places like it that frankly do it better, this place is just ok. I live close to this location and have eaten here several times and while the staff is always great and it is usually pretty busy during the typical rushes throughout the day, it is quite underwhelming. Being a big fan of both burgers and pastrami, I have ordered he cardiologist a couple times and both times my patty was not pink at all (like they say it will be in the menu) and my pastrami was very salty and dry. That was consistent each time I ate it so I probably won't ever eat it again. The onion rings are bland, French fries and just normal French fries, and honestly the best thing I've eaten here is breakfast. Like I said, the staff is great, food is underwhelming. It's just average. Nothing to brag about or recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and American spirit of the restaurant. We ate breakfast which was good but not super. My dads breakfast burrito was dry. My pigs in a blanket was good but I've had better. The prices were reasonable and staff was nice. I would try it again for lunch or dinner to see if that is better."}
{"text":"I really like this place been here a few times the service is great and the food is awesome never had to wait all that long. My only thing was that my eggs have been over cooked past couple visits but other than that I have no complaints. Would recommend anyone to this location."}
{"text":"We love Haymakers! The food is very good, the beer is cold, the atmosphere is inviting, it is close to home. What more can I ask for?"}
{"text":"Such a great place and with a bartender like Jill, you are sure to have a great experience and night out! I've never been disappointed with any of the dinner food I've ordered. Breakfast is also amazing with lots of options and top it off with a mimosa for a great start to your day! I will definitely be a return customer."}
{"text":"The name for this review is \"half off pints, full time bad service\"  A friend and I stopped in to try this new place, used to be Tres Margaritas. We sat in the bar area at a booth after the hostess told us to seat ourselves. We got there 30 minutes before happy hour ended and we both ordered their happy hour special of half-off pints. No one came to our table though, I made eye contact with 3 servers, yet we were never approached. My friend went to the bar to get our drinks and said that the bartender saw him yet ignored him for a long time. We were there about 10 minutes when a server came over with a trainee and menus. We were polite and didn't mention that we had to get our own drinks. She told us that if we needed anything to flag her or the trainee down. However, that was the last time we saw them. We sat there for 2 hours taking our time drinking and watching a game that was on the TV above us. In those 2 hours since that server came over, no one came to our table to see if we wanted anything else. We left.  The women's bathroom was a mess. Dirty floors and 2 of the toilets were not useable and needed major attention, yet there was no sign on the door letting us know that. I got an eye full not once but twice trying to find a useable stall.   The only good thing I enjoyed about this place was that they had on WNBA! First bar I have ever been to that airs women's professional basketball. Too bad I won't be back."}
{"text":"Tried this place out tonight. Wont be going back...asked for a certain drink off their menu. Bartender seemed confused about what I asked for ...gave me what he thought it was. Ended up sending the drink back. Food we ordered came to us cold. Not impressed at all by this place."}
{"text":"I was hoping to have a solid meal here based on the Yelp reviews.  We had 6 different appetizers (Happy Hour) as our meal.  The wings were the only thing I would try again and they were dry this trip.  The ribs had good flavor but were cold and dry.  The pickles seemed to be the only thing house made and they were big spears that didn't go over well.  The bourbon on the happy hour menu I wanted they were out of so the only other options were Jack or Jim.  Can get that anywhere.  Skip the nachos and the cheese fries.  I doubt we will give them a 2nd chance unless it is for b-fast.  A little harder to screw up b-fast!!!    D."}
{"text":"I always enjoy going into the Haymaker. I receive the best service. I usually request Tyler as a server or bartender when there. He does a great job with entertaining and is reliable on the job! I would highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Went here today with my family for breakfast. Waited 20mins for a table. Ok, no problem. Got to our table and it took forever for our waiter to come by and take our drink order and then a long time to bring our drinks and when they did arrive we were missing 2 drinks. We ordered and literally had to wait an hour for our food to arrive. We weren't even checked on for drink refills except once for coffee. I had an empty water glass throughout breakfast. I had to share my mom's water. We were ready to walk out and I wish we did. After about 45 mins I flagged our waiter down and asked how much longer and he told us food was coming up. The manager came by to give a half ass apology and told us the delay was due to my brother's steak and eggs being burnt and it had to get redone. I call bullshit! I think the waiter forgot to put our order in. We finally get our order and 3 of our 4 meals were wrong. Afraid it would take forever to get our food correct we just ate it as is. We did get 50% off our check but I think we shouldn't have paid for anything. Nothing stellar about the food and the service was horrible!! The wait staff didn't seem to care that we waited so long nor the manager. NEVER going there again! Very unhappy with service there."}
{"text":"First time at this location. Excellent omelette, served hot and fresh. Like the senior prices on select menu items. Friendly service. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with my husband, the resort staff recommended this place. We ordered the Mac Daddy burger and we split it with fries. The burger was seasoned nicely and topped with macaroni and cheese & onion straws and cold slaw (had it on the side though) it was awesome!!also had a flight of whiskey which has to be done if you're on vacation!!! Waitress was very knowledgeable about the food, beers and whiskey selections. Great restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the (\"rhythm\" aka \"bbq\" hot) wings.   5 stars for server Becca!   2 stars for the bartender, who made me feel like an inconvenience rather than a patron of the establishment. DO NOT order a whiskey flight at the bar before being seated at your table for dinner. According to the bartenders and hostesses, you are a bother for doing so. After clarifying with the hostess... yes, it is \"difficult and annoying\" to transfer your tab from the bar to a table. Okay, so the impression I got from the bartender was correct. He will be polite until you leave the bar for a table, at which point go f*** yourself. This despite the fact that he was--at first--happy to host you and transfer your service! I felt more than a little disrespected at the bar.   Now, once I got to a table, things changed. The burger, fries, and wings were really great. Great selection of beer as well. Whiskey flight was good too, though ordered at the cantankerous and \"far too busy\" bar. Becca (table server) was a joy! Yet somehow I can't get the bitter taste of bartender out of my mouth."}
{"text":"We found our neighborhood lunch and breakfast resturaunt with optional bar now a 50 beer bar and pool room that has changed the menus eliminating the best onion rings (frings) and many other items we had become acquainted with since opening.  The resturaunt seating is secondary to the sports bar scenario. Our waiter Whitney, was at the Peoria store, too far to travel. This renovation reminds me of Classic Coke marketing, we will not be participating."}
{"text":"Ive been to this restaurant several times.  My family and I really like it!  You can order breakfast all day long and their happy hour menu is quite a savings.  My husband and I like the game room and on Wed/Sun kids eat dinner for free.  I am allergic to gluten AND dairy ...but I can eat here with no problem.  Their gf menu is very extensive and it is no problem to ask that your food is cooked without butter. I appreciate that the staff has not once made me feel bad about my allergy.  Its embarrassing for me and a hassle.  This is a must!  Check it out guys!"}
{"text":"Visited during the lunch rush. Sat at the bar with Jenna and had the best service of my life!"}
{"text":"I don't think we will be back.  The place smelled like sewage when we entered.   The lady explained it had something to do with the pipes being close to the street and the heat and that it was being fixed.  Ok. The thing I can't over look is that we we're non stop fighting fruit flies.  And they left the fruit bins wide open.  Yuck!  They need to tend to the fruit fly issue as well.  The burger tasted gassy and it was all overly greasy.  Some issues really need to be addressed to make this place a place we would return to.  They do have a nice selection of bourbon,  but the old fashioned tasted really watered down.  Very unfortunate!"}
{"text":"I had the combo of ribs and chicken.  The ribs were great, juicy and falling off the bone.  Chicken was extremely dry, took it home to dogs.  Hubby had burger,  was not asked how he wanted it cooked, no ketchup nor mustard was brought nor even asked if wanted.  We were asked if we wanted soda refills,  we said yes, but never got them. Service was terrible.  Had to ask \"greeter\" for soda and the rest of our meal that was never brought out.   On the way home, hubby and I were discussing the service, and I asked how big a tip he left. He said none, because an 18 percent gratuity was added in!!! I was shocked and asked why.  He said he noticed the number of guests in our party was 9, and tip was auto added. The problem is there were only TWO of us!!!  Our server was Patricia. ... not only was the service bad, she let this happen."}
{"text":"We go for breakfast every Saturday morning. Staff is super friendly helpful and welcoming.   Try the Huevos Benedictos or pancakes. So good!!"}
{"text":"Love the entire place. All the wait staff is so nice. The food is always good, especially the AZ veggie burger and a great Moscow mule!  Its a whiskey bar. And tvs galore. Regular and love it"}
{"text":"Had a great time last Thursday!  Very nice service & manager made a point of coming over and checking in. Great food - the ribs were wonderful!  Thank you."}
{"text":"My husbands beer was flat and warm. The steak sandwich looked like beef jerky, and was not worth the $15, maybe $4. The server was nice and attentive, but we won't be back, ever again."}
{"text":"Great food, Great Staff, and Great Drinks! Nice selection of whiskey more than anyone else I've seen. We needed to order a large to go order for about 10 people, and the manager went out of his way for pricing ala carte, and also get extra's that we needed. Bartender's actually understand the art of not just giving you a drink, but also some conversation!"}
{"text":"As always an incredible meal.  I want to especially thank our server, Riley, who was attentive, polite and full of smiles, in spite of the mean crotchety old couple sitting next to us.  They were rude and nasty to Riley and she smiled and kept her cool."}
{"text":"Today was our first visit. It was awesome. The food was great. Prices are very reasonable. Mandy was our waitress and she is fantastic. Very pleasant and knowledgable about the menu items. She made several suggestions which we appreciated. Tammy, the manager was also great. She stopped by our table and also gave recommendations. We loved this place and will be returning soon and often."}
{"text":"Fantastic food for any meal! Great portions and yummy food guaranteed. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The owner messaged me publicly on Facebook. He told me I was a \"liar\" and my findings of food poisoning were \"unfounded\". I went to my doctor. I indeed have Staph Food Poisoning. He also threatened me telling me that I am \"defaming his restaurant and I have no right to do so\". I was shocked an \"owner\" if a restaurant would treat a paying customer like this. I have put my review on my local neighborhood app only to find out I'm not the only one who became ill there. I will never go back for their spoiled, frozen food. At least get a cook in there that can cook real food and care if it might hurt someone. This \"owner\" has been rude to way too many people (read Yelp reviews) and this is not the way to run a business. I will tell everyone I know to read Yelp before visiting there. Oh yeah, he said my \"food poisoning was unfounded because of too many negative reviews on Yelp\"."}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious food- I had the grilled salmon with wilted spinach salad. The description on the menu does not do it justice. I will definitely be back for this dish again."}
{"text":"Found ourselves hungry on the opposite side of town.   Googled for a FAMILY OWNED restaurant.  Found it in a sea of corporate eateries in the Target parking lot!  Looking GOOD.  Nice WHISKEY menu.  They also carry some Arizona brewery beers so kudos to the owners for promoting Local beers. Clean, simple set-up very patriotic without being corny.  I ordered the French Dip and Frings (1/2 and 1/2).  Very fresh. Very tasty. NOT oily.  Side order of fresh horseradish brought tears of joy to my eyes and cleared my sinuses for the weekend!    Pleasant service.  Good sized portions.  Very reasonably priced menu.  LOCALLY OWNED - think local, eat local, drink local."}
{"text":"I don't think it's worth five stars but it's definitely worth more than four. Service was good, nothing great but the speed was so impressive. And the food was awesome."}
{"text":"We only came here for happy hour so haven't had anything but wings and beer but we are eager to go back! They make there own wing sauce as well as BBQ sauce, the wings were great! Friendly bar tender, Shannon or Jenna I think (sorry). They tout themselves as a whiskey bar with a very extensive selection of American, Canadian and of course Irish whiskey. Good happy hour and I hear their brunch is amazing with items such as South Western Eggs Benedict w a Jalapeno Hollandaise sauce. Nice, dark and clean country/Americana decor."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Local business does it right. The happy hour is amazing,  try the mini ribs on top of cole slaw they are the best ribs I've ever eaten! Beer is fresh and yummy on tap local breweries. Support all local!"}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to try since I live nearby. Ok looking place, they kind of went for the \"Faux Cabin\" look or saloon, depending on which angle you first see the place.   The server was kind of goofy, and he tried to make our visit his experience too. I don't really care for that type of server (when they seem to be trying to be funny or your entertainment for the night) Especially when they are in the mood to be irreverent or unusually chatty. He was nice and did a good job just the same however.    Now, the beers they serve are nice and cold and are served in a mason jar. Highlight of the evening...but a precipitous drop followed shortly thereafter.   I had the fish and chips which were hot, but ultimately - and Im not exaggerating - were flavorless. It's a shame too because they looked perfectly prepared and had the correct browning and crispy breading. They would've had absolutely NO flavor had I not used the malt vinegar and a touch of the tartar sauce, which if I'm not mistaken has something like horseradish mixed in. Not my cup of tea but whatever.   My wife's dish; not at all as advertised. She ordered a breaded fried chicken breast topped with cream sauce. Uh - no it's NOT!  It looked like chicken broth with a mix of vegetables in said broth. It was seriously an abomination to call that \"cream sauce\". Needless to say, she sent it back and ordered the fish and chips as I did. She didn't believe me they were flavorless - until her order arrived. For her, the KFC-style coleslaw was the highlight of her meal.   Probably won't be back unless it is for breakfast. I mean, how bad can they screw up eggs?"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time and it was great! Very cool and relaxed atmosphere with a huge selection of beer choices along with a really yummy menu. Ordered the T.A.B sandwich with fries and onion rings and it was perfection. The B.L.A.T sandwich was also delicious, the deep fried tomato really enhanced the flavor. Our waiter was Albert and he was extremely friendly and helpful in making suggestions  since we were first timers. He was also very accommodating about making substitutions for us. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place for Sunday breakfast. Michael, Amber and Jill are great bartenders and servers. Great food and excellent service even on the busiest of days. Love this place."}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times over the past month. I have come in on different days of the week for lunch, happy hour and dinner. The atmosphere is great and the staff is very friendly. I frequently have Amanda as my server and she is very attentive and has a great personality. These qualities are a big reason I continue to come back.  I have tried a different item on the menu each time I have been to The Haymaker and have been very happy with the portions, flavor and the ability to accommodate my allergy to onions. I have been so impressed that I have recommended the use of the 'pig pen' to a valley association I am a member of for future meetings. I highly recommend you make a trip and decide for yourself."}
{"text":"Went to dinner last night.  My dinner came out wrong but it did taste good.  I got the sun-dried pasta with Shrimp.  Disappointed that there were only 4 shrimp in it. I had ordered the pasta with chicken.  I'd say that it's ok. The servers need a little training to not say the soup is \"gross\"."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here today.  In my opinion, this is some of the best food and service we have experienced in a long time.  It was a busy Sunday and even large parties were getting sat quickly with a minimal wait.  We were greeted promptly by our server within a minute of being seated and his casual yet professional greeting made it obvious he was well trained.  Beverage orders were taken and delivered promptly.  Our food order came up quickly, within 10 minutes of our order.  My wife ordered country fried steak and eggs.  It was a huge portion, enough for 2.  It was served on a bed of  biscuits which were fresh made and didn't taste like  the preservative filled rubber biscuts you get at other chains.  The eggs were done perfectly, and the gravy also tasted fresh made.  My wife ordered country potatoes with her meal and said these were also good.  I had the Haymaker Benedict - eggs omelet style served over a fried chicken patty, spinach,  bacon and mashed potatoes, topped with chipolte sauce.  The portion size of this dish also  enough for 2.  While the chipolte sauce  was spicy, it was very good and fresh, not canned.  The eggs on my dish were also perfectly done and the bacon was amazing with more smoky fresh flavor than most gourmet bacon. The mashed potatoes were the perfect consistency and tasted fresh made. Throughout breakfast our server and the manager checked on us, but not to the point of being bothersome.  The manager was very friendly and took a real interest in what we thought of everything. My only negatives would be the coffee, which was average for a $ 2.35 cup and I didn't get a refill on it until end of breakfast.  Also, both dishes were a little pricey, but for portion size and quality I can't really complain.  Good food does cost money to make. In summary, if you're looking for breakfast that's fresh made, homstyle comfort food with good efficient service, try the Haymaker.  We can't wait to go back and try the lunch/dinner menu.  They have specials listed (Burger night, kids eat free, happy hour) that all look like good values."}
{"text":"Great service. The manager was really nice too. They forgot to bring my wine so they gave it to me on the house. I'll be back! Thank you!"}
{"text":"We were a large group.  We had a really good waitress.  There was someone delivering the drinks.  She leaned across the table to deliver a cup of hot coffee and spilled about half of it on the table and made no effort to clean it or apologize.  I asked her if she could bring some napkins and she said, \"oh, did I spill it?\"  She still didn't clean it up.  My friend cleaned it up with tissures from her purse.  Someone asked for water and her comment was, \"I only have two hands!\"  It is a good thing she wasn't our waitress. The menu has good choices.  The food was decent, not great. The checks came.  They were given to the wrong people.  Our waitress said that the names on the check didn't matter as they all reflecte the first person's check that she ran.  I tried to explain to her that that wasn't right because some of us had discounts and the bills that she gave us didn't reflect the discounts.  It took another ten minutes to receive the corrected checks."}
{"text":"Our server was paul i think and for some reason i felt he was rushing us to order. I had the pulled pork sandwich from their weekly specials. It was good, just a little too sweet. Pulled pork had no flavor and it seemed like it was boiled. T"}
{"text":"First time here this AM, wife loved the cinnamon apple French toast and the Western omelette was a perfect mix and quantity of ingredients.  Often there is too little or too much of one or more of peppers, onion or ham.  If your real hungry get the pancake with it, again terrific.  Service was rock solid.  Came back again today 1/21/17 while watching our daughter's house and dogs.  We were not disappointed!  Service - tops, food - terrific (eggs Benedict and California omelette) - Bloody Mary was great and since we arrived about 11 AM, it was just 3 bucks!  Each time the manager has asked how everything is.  No reason for less than 5 stars as they will fix what you don't like (witnessed that today at another table) with a smile and sincerity."}
{"text":"First time here... Food was good burger was okay onion rings were really good. The steak salad had a lot o steak and the dressing was good. Good beer selection. Perfect basic food to have with beer. I will come back."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in town by far! Great customer service. They make you feel at home. Food was amazing and didn't have to wait long at all. I definitely recommend coming here if you're ever in town."}
{"text":"It took 35 minutes to get a glass of water Tuesday night.  We left and ate across the street after the Peoria Chamber's get together. A place that has almost 50 whiskey's, it beats me how you ever get served.    If it took 35 minutes to get water, do you think I am going to order food?  Then they thanked me for coming as we left.    Besides that, 2 employees did not know the Wi-Fi password."}
{"text":"So, I have been back a few times now for breakfast and lunch. The service has been pretty good and the food has been excellent.  The beer taps have been working and there is a good selection to choice from.  Very large portions for food and an excellent happy hour that is every day.  The regular bloody mary wasn't very impressive, but when I got the bacon bloody mary, it was very good.  I  have tried the Chicken fried steak breakfast,  Arizona omelette, Breakfast burrito and the Buffalo chicken sandwich Cajun fries.  All of them were very delicious.  They do have Gluten Free and vegan options that you can see in one of my pics."}
{"text":"Great food...fun place... we had iced coffees, cheese fries...zucchini was yummmmmmy! Ribs... Burgers and BLT with turkey and avacado... no complaints all around.  Service was amazing... Manager came by and checked to make sure we were good a couple times! If you are looking for casual and just all around a friendly lunch... Haymaker is a nice place to stop. Ask for Josiah!"}
{"text":"Great service, no complaints at all there.  The food is pretty good - bbq doesn't quite reach Midwest quality, but it does well for Arizona. The burgers are good, and their macaroni and cheese shouldn't be forgotten."}
{"text":"The Haymaker is in a nice location and the staff is usually very friendly.  Wait times can vary greatly, however, and although the breakfast food is great, dinners are not always up to par. Because of a few poor dinners, I usually stick to breakfasts there"}
{"text":"Got the Lariat burger but replaced the beef with grilled chicken. Not the BEST I've ever had (chicken was a little dry) but still very good. Fries were perfect! Hot, crispy and salty"}
{"text":"I am shocked at the high reviews of this place. I waited until after our 4th visit because I wanted to like it but everything from the food to the service is average at best but really poor in my opinion. We've had breakfast twice and dinner twice. This last time will be the last time."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre - not terrible but not great by my Asian chicken salad was literally to die for!!!! Seriously so good! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good food and and nice atmosphere . I like that they are serious about protecting people that can't have gluten. I have been here a few times and will certainly be back again."}
{"text":"The Haymaker Peoria is a traditional American bar and restaurant nestled in suburban Phoenix. Their location in Peoria is in the middle of a large strip mall with lots of parking.  The interior belies the basic exterior with a modern country decor with lots of seating and many televisions. We chose to sit at the bar, but were able to experience the full menu. Service was a little slow, however we were able to get our drinks and food with only a little effort.  Haymaker has a large selection of whisky, and my college friend and I sampled quite a few. My Manhattan and whisky flight were well appreciated. We chose the fried pickles and country fried steak for dinner which were decent but lacked the richness of a classic dish.  Overall, The Haymaker Peoria is a good option in the suburbs but lacks that something special to really stand out above the crowd. I love traditional American dishes and wish them the best to promote these classics."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful local Phoenix area restaurant.  The menu is pretty big, mostly classic American dishes, though my favorite is their Huevos Rancheros. Order it with the hash browns; they layer the eggs over the potatoes on a crispy tortilla. It is delicious.   The service is always friendly and we greatly enjoy the Americana decor.  This is our go to for breakfasts or when weekday dinner."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! We love the all day breakfast. The staff and management are always so friendly. Great service! Highly recommend to anyone looking for breakfast, lunch, or dinner!"}
{"text":"This place is good for those people who loves comfort food. ... the food taste like home cook. ...yummy.  ...  place feel like a dinner. ...  huge and clean. ... Price is about $12-15 or more plus drinks per person.  ...  My son love kids  meal menu lots to choose from.  ... Customer service is good. ... We enjoy having dinner here. ..."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast. They keep a limited breakfast menu all day.  Food was decent. Nothing too exciting or out of the ordinary. Chorizo came in patty form which is uncommon but they were good. Only issue I had was that after the check was settled- service stopped. We were drinking coffee and no more refills came. I would have tipped more for continued service."}
{"text":"Tried their Sunday morning breakfast and we were not disappointed everything was delicious!! Food was outstanding at a good price. We Highly recommend it. The only problem that we had was with our server Alberto he seemed to not had enough sleep the night before as he was a little bit cranky and forgetful. Grandkids ordered pancakes, they arrived with no syrup or butter took 10 minutes to get them and by then the pancakes were cold. I ordered light white toast and it came out almost burnt, I complained and it took another 10 minutes for it to arrive. We will be back but we are definitely going to avoid his tables."}
{"text":"We have been there several times by ourselves and with friends.  We all keep wanting to go back when we are wondering what to do.  The atmosphere is so welcoming!  Feels like you just walked into the series set \"Cheers\".  Everyone is so friendly and they are sure to recognize us and give us a friendly welcome.  The service is wonderful!  I know there are a few, four or lower star ratings, however, this place is just getting started and the owner, Joey, and his brother, have done amazing at trying to please everyone!  There are too many \"jabs\" and expectations on such a new place.  It has become the neighborhood hangout and Joey has great plans on trying to meet all the expectations!  He is planning an outdoor patio, and as someone wrote earlier, yes, Joey knows his whiskeys!  We love their happy hour!  Lots to choose from and great prices.  We always get the wings and ribs :)  I really hope you give it a try and hope that all those not so satisfied, try it again.  They are new.  Give them a chance."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast and excellent service in the bar this morning! Highly recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! A real local's place! We have been here many times and every time we walk out happy. This morning I had the Griddle Breakfast with the best darn pancakes that I have ever had and I have to say that I am kind of an expert when it comes to pancakes. My hubby had the French dip which he said was also the best one that he has ever had. I cannot say enough about this place... Oh and every NFL game on Sunday!"}
{"text":"This is actually one of our favorite places to go.  They have great food, and huge selection of whiskeys and other specialty cocktails.  They have something for everyone here.  Beware, because they are so awesome this location can GET BUSY during certain times... :)"}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast and it was pretty straightforward. The food was pretty good and the service was good.  I would come back but I don't think that there was anything particularly unique about the restaurant."}
{"text":"This used to be a Native Grill, but shut down several months ago.  The Haymaker has great food, drinks, and atmosphere at a reasonable price (Applebee's/Chili's)!  All the NFL games were on, and the service was spectacular (thanks to our waitress/hostess, Courtney)!"}
{"text":"My husband and i eat breakfast here every week. The service and staff culture need a lot of work. We always get terrible service from day 1 at this place. Learning curve is over, they need to get it right. My eggs where cooked wrong last time and the coffee is always terrible. Food is good typically...staff is not."}
{"text":"Excellent!!! Great food, great atmosphere, friendly service.   Great place for dining with friends or family.   I especially like the Pulled Pork Sandwich or the Texan Burger and their Cajun Fries or Fring (fries & onion rings). One thing though, you have to ask for extra BBQ sauce on the side because they're typically served a little light on the sauce.   For those who are Gluten Free, They also have a gluten free menu upon request and can serve their sandwiches with gluten free bread and buns.   Also you get a free kids meal with an adult entree order on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, friendly, clean, generous, atmosphere, happy hour and attentive."}
{"text":"Third time to Haymaker.  We had 6 for dinner and again the staff was very accommodating.  I had the bacon burger and fresh cut french fries which was very good.  The other members of my party all had very good meals.  Looks I'll be back for a 4th visit soon."}
{"text":"Giving this place 3 stars .. I ordered 2 of the salmon with sautéed spinach which they gave more onions then spinach in there and the salmon wasn't prepared as ordered. I ordered just 1 well done and they were both dry.. I also had several family members order the ribs. They said they were horrible full of fat and tasted boiled . Not sure if it's always this mediocre or because we had a big to go order about an hour before they closed"}
{"text":"We were a party of six celebrating our annual Christmas lunch at Haymaker on Friday, December 22nd.  Although they were crowded, we were well treated by both our excellent waiter Nick and the Manager Jill.  Any problems were quickly and efficiently addressed, beverages were refreshed and Nick returned to our table several times to check on satisfaction.  Thank you for such a positive experience."}
{"text":"This business is going to be like all the others at this location and be gone soon.  I have tried it 3 or 4 times and each time it has been well below average.  Soup and salad combo for $8 consist of the smallest cup of runny, cool soup with no flavor.  The salad had some wilted lettuce, 1 sour grape tomato that was cut in half and a ring of onion on the same plate as the soup.  I have had their breakfast burrito that was 95% potato with the tortilla shell old and hard.  Just cannot recommend this place to anyone.  We try to support local but cannot support this place."}
{"text":"We ate breakfast and ordered the huevos rancheros, mushroom and spinach omelets and all three dishes were delicious.  The omelets are made with 2 or 3 eggs- your choice.  The home-made biscuits are fantastic.  If you eat here- come hungry!"}
{"text":"So I would say to anyone who has not tried this place out its worth a shot. They have a wide selection of drinks and food. The waitress said to order a burger but I decided to get a blt with a fried tomato. It was ok would not order it again. Had the wings on happy hour for just 5$ they were good.  Service  was awesome very friendly. The wife had a pastrami sandwich. Very little meat not the best sandwich. If I come back I would probably stick with a steak or burger. They serve beers in mason jars if you like that. Me I just want a regular glass.  There is also a 10$ coupon you get in a mail.  I am giving it 4 stars until next time."}
{"text":"I am not a burger fan, I repeat NOT a burger fan. But I will definitely go back for another. Also I'm very picky about sweet potato fries and I stole a couple of my mom's and they were great! Very fresh. The house made Whiskey BBQ is amazing. Love they server beer in a mason jar! (Country girl at heart). Our server was great, he actually got my son to eat by bribing him with Jelly Beans. Can't remember his name unfortunately =/"}
{"text":"I've heard about this place for years and wish I would have tried it sooner!  We've been back several times...I especially like that they now serve breakfast all day. The California omelet can't be beat!  And the serving sizes are huge...I always order a side of country potatoes and a biscuit the size of a small melon! The pancakes and french toast are also delicious.  The staff is always friendly, the happy hour prices are nice, and you can't beat Kids Eat Free on Sunday nights. Highly recommend you try Haymaker!!!"}
{"text":"I have only had breakfast here and always order the Benedict which is always great. The service is a bit lacking but not so bad that I won't return. There's never a long wait and everything is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go! The bread pudding is always on point along with the boneless wings. The service is great as well, very welcoming place."}
{"text":"My husband tasted my French Dip and said I should eat his burger because the French Dip wasn't too good.   I tried a piece of beef and it was very chewy and reminded me of shoe leather. Some of the beef wasn't edible because it was like rubber and cut the wrong way with the grain instead of against it but they did take the time to add onions and mushrooms to it.  The Bread was some kind of squishy bread that seemed like a relative of a hot dog roll and my sweet potato fries were very squishy and just warm. Maybe it just wasn't the best day for a French Dip or sweet potato fries.  My husband's Burger was OK! The burger was cooked medium the cheese was melted and the roll was fresh. The fries on this plate were fresh and crisp. The green chile on the burger was cold and would have been better if it was warm but still the burger was OK. No it wasn't the best burger but it was OK.  The menu is very basic or uninspired depending on your take of it. This is a family friendly kind of place and is budget priced. It's the kind of place I might take my nieces or nephews too instead of Burger King and also my older relatives that don't like anything ethnic because of the kind of food and prices but I wouldn't ever think of getting a French Dip again.  2.5 Stars Rounded UP to three stars because the burger was OK."}
{"text":"Hope this place last but the manager lady is not very nice. Customer service is super important and when the manager at even have great service you got a problem"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast very generous portions and the atmosphere was nice. Very long wait times on Saturday and Sunday to get a table when we noticed 8 empty tables in the restaurant obviously the management is poor during the weekends so service is better during the week days."}
{"text":"Great place. Loved the pulled pork sandwich. Staff is friendly. Very patriotic atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We are moving out of state and I don't know when we will be back- so I wanted to leave a departing review. The boyfriend turned in to the husband and this became our usual date night spot. We came here 2-3x a month for a year and a half. Nobody ever got to know us by name... but over that time we enjoyed a variety of their foods. The BLAT is probably my favorite dish... and their Mac & Cheese is good. I like their Fried Pickles, but wish they were chips instead of spears. I did request that they cut them in to pieces once and they happily obliged. I will miss the Iced Mocha as well. It was my special treat this past year since I was pregnant and then nursing and couldn't enjoy a beer.   Other foods I've enjoyed-  BBQ salad Buffalo chicken sandwich Hamburgers French fries French dip Tomato bisque & adult grilled cheese   My husband said he really recommends the ribs and macaroni & cheese.   We never dined here for breakfast but the menu always looked good.  I will say at times the service is slow... very slow... so you can't be starving or in a hurry... but everyone has always been nice."}
{"text":"It was my birthday and I really wanted to try something we haven't been to before.This is another establishment I have heard about for awhile. So I packed up the girls and headed north bound on the 303. We arrived there around 4:30, just before the dinner rush. We were greeted and seated immediately. Our waiter took our drink order very quickly and took our order. Since we never been there before we asked what he recommended for dinner, so he gave us a few ideas. I ordered the fried chicken, It was smothered with their gravy on top w/the chicken on their mashed potatoes, this dish also came with some vegi's. I really enjoyed the chicken, it was cooked with some good spices and it was not dried. Potatoes still had their peelings but thats the way I like it. Now their vegi's had a mixture of peas, squash, zucchini, broccoli, and carrots. I am not a peas person so I didn't even touch that. Their carrots were amazing, I would order the vegetables just for the carrots. Since I like chili, I had to order their mama's chili. This chili is great, might be a little spicy to some. But it has an amazing taste. Wife had their gringo burger and she loved it, gave me a bite and it was really good.  The girls had the burger, and chicken tenders. Seemed they both really enjoyed their meals. We had a great time! Food was great, service was great, and the atmosphere was great. We will diffidently come back again."}
{"text":"We have yet been disappointing with either Haymakers location. We have been to this Goodyear location on a few occasions now. And every time it has been a great experience. Service has been great, ambiance has been good, and the food has been amazing. I really enjoy their chili, burger is good, fried chicken is great, anything we have ordered has been very good. This place is becoming a favorite if ours and we will continue to try something different during our future visits."}
{"text":"Ordered take out and the food was delicious. It was hot and ready when we arrived to pick it up. Best steak sandwich I've had."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our breakfast at Haymaker's. The restaurant is large and has a bar area. Our server, Jennifer, was attentive and friendly.  I had the Bloody Mary with bacon. Yum!  Everything is better with bacon, right?  I ordered the California omelette with hash browns and a homemade biscuit. My omelette wasn't really fluffy like I like it, but it had good flavor with the avocado, bacon, tomatoes, cheddar   The hash browns were cooked crispy like I like it.  The best thing was the massive homemade biscuit. Yummmm!  I asked for honey and it was just the right accompaniment. I recommend this place for their food, service and biscuits!!"}
{"text":"Had the pastrami sandwich.  Not much meat. A couple slices. Ordered Baked Mac n Cheese as my side. Pasta was way over cooked. Mushy.  And the cheese was dried out.  Server was friendly and prompt.  Don't think I'll return to this Haymaker."}
{"text":"This place is the best!!!! Service is beyond what is expected.  We have now been here for breakfast lunch and dinner and have received amazing service from Sal, Marc and  Courtney. Food is great. Drinks are great. TVs are perfect for football. Love coming to Haymakers."}
{"text":"Uhhhh, yum!! I had roast beef au-jus. It was enough to take half home for my fiancé. The atmosphere was casual. The prices were cheap. It felt very homey; the feeling was similar to Cracker Barrel. The waitress was great. Not too much to say, except that it was a great casual lunch place. I went with my Pop for Father's Day, at his request. I would definitely go there with the old folks again. Not really a date place, IMO, FYI."}
{"text":"A very unique environment... Welcoming and friendly.  We were a small party of 3 and were seated immediately.  The place was packed so we didnt receive a server immediately however a bartender came and took care of our drinks and order.    Other than slightly delayed service due to the volume they were serving... The experience was great.  The manager was also active in the seating area attending to tables that had checks waiting or orders needing to be received.  I ordered the texan burger and it was amazing.  I was genuinely disaapointed when i finished it because it was so delicious and i wantwd more.  The onion ring like garnishes were to die for.   The regular fries could have used seasoning however the cajun option was excellent.  5 star due to the friendly staff and delicious burger."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast on a Sunday and we're seated immediately. The service was kind of slow, but the waiter was nice. I ordered the salted caramel iced coffee and it was soooo sweet! I probably wouldn't order it again. I ordered the chicken fried steak Which came with eggs and a huge biscuit which I ordered on the side. The steak itself was just okay but the biscuit was really yummy. I'd order just biscuits and gravy next time. My husband got an omelet with onions, ham, and bell peppers. It was also just okay. It seemed a little dry. The toast was Nice and buttery though and the hash browns were pretty good. Overall, this place was good if you were around, but I wouldn't go out of my way to have breakfast here."}
{"text":"The steak and eggs was perfect and I loved them! The steak medium rare just the way I love it! The eggs over easy was amazing! And the service was beyond great!"}
{"text":"We love the Haymaker. Have several times. Second time for breakfast. Everything was great, with exception of the biscuit. Oversized, and very dry. Need to cut the size and change the recipe. Everything else - GREAT!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Both times the food was delicious. The first visit was for a breakfast on a Sunday morning. The place was packed and the service was SLOW. There were four of us and all of our food came out at different times.   I came back two days later for dinner and the restaurant was much less crowded, the server was very friendly, the burgers were delicious, and the atmosphere was good.   I've heard nothing but good things from others who have tried this restaurant as well."}
{"text":"Our favorite place for breakfast.  The biscuits are the size of softballs and they are delicious.  I had the Arizona omelette and my husband had the Country Fried steak and eggs. Both dishes were perfect. My teenage daughter also likes this place and she is hard to please.  I can't wait to come back and try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"We visited here about 3 times now and every time it's been excellent I've eaten the salmon and it was head over heels the best. I asked for it medium rare and that's exactly how it comes out beer is great they could probably use an extra bartender because it seems like the bar is always full.  I have to say I was reluctant to try this place since the last two places were so awful but to my surprise it was great I recommend it"}
{"text":"Service was mediocre. Ordered a bloody Mary and there was absolutely no garnish in a tiny glass! The table next to us that was obviously regulars or maybe even a waitress off duty got the most amazing looking big bloody Mary's at their table with sticks of bacon in them. Biscuits and gravy was just an enormous biscuit with a too small an amount of gravy and husband asked for eggs over medium and they were so runny they were inedible. Only positive was the shirts were cute and the place was clean. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Service was okay. (although the server & food runner made us uncomfortable) Beer selection was good.  If we come back it'll be to try their breakfast menu, maybe we'll have better luck with the food & service."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant and the food is good too.  Every time I go here the poor woman bartending is alone and buried. Don't quite understand why they don't have two or three back there,  it's enough to keep me away though. Not going to wait 30 minutes for a drink or a bill anymore, hopefully it will improve."}
{"text":"Went with the family and had a good meal. My wife loved the BBQ sauce and enjoyed her pulled pork sandwich, with a GF bun which was a BIG plus. We will definitely be going back.  Only downside was the gentlemen behind us yelling at his daughter for 20 minutes telling her to order or she won't eat."}
{"text":"Support family/local businesses. This place has great food & service. We dine here about once a month. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in town and at worst top two on the west side. For its location it is the best place for several miles overall."}
{"text":"My first visit but not my last.  I've driven by The Haymarker Restaurant dozens of times but have never stopped, that is until tonight.  As you walk into The Haymaker you can't help but admire the decor. The decor is very patriotic and respectful of our American values.  I thought we might be in for a long wait, as the restaurant was packed. However, we were seated within a few minutes.  For being as busy as it was, our waiter, Javier was excellent and attentive.  The Haymaker has an impressive selection of whisky and beers.  The whiskey list is impressive with selections I have never heard of such as Monkey Shoulder. The beer selection was very diverse with several local micro brewers represented.    I couldn't decide what entrée to choose so with a recommendation from Javier, I choose the fish and chips. The fish was absolutely delicious and  flaky.  The fish was light, crunchy, cooked perfectly, and served hot with the best homemade tater sauce and seasoned french fries in town.  My dinner companion had the Grown Up Grilled Cheese, and ribbies and commented that both entrées were awesome.  The entrée portions at Haymaker are large, enough for two.  You will not leave The Haymaker hungry.  Even after finishing our large dinner we decided to have dessert. So we ordered a serving of bread pudding that was also  large enough for two. The bread pudding  was some of the best bread pudding I have ever had.    All during our meal we were checked on and during dessert the owner/manger stopped by and asked us about our dining experience.    Haymaker is definitely on our list of restaurants to visit again. We will definitely be back, during happy hour (4-7 pm) when the craft beers are 1/2 price.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend  Haymaker to anyone for either breakfast, lunch, or dinner. As an added benefit, The Haymaker  Restaurant is not a chain but is locally owned, and that's always an added incentive."}
{"text":"This is our new family favorite! Fun staff (ask for shane!) Relaxed atmosphere and never a disappointment with the food. The cat fish tacos are to die for!"}
{"text":"OK, back for Sunday breakfast.  As always, fine service and we do enjoy the floor manager - he keeps this place moving.  And he checks  on things!  Very good bloody mary.  Good Prosecco.    Chicken fried steak - good, could have used a bit more pepper for me.  But the biscuits (?) were gooey and horrible.  And the home fries were fresh from the freezer - just shaped balls thrown in the fryer (think they're called tater tots)..no onion, no peppers, no taste.  Eggs done just right.  Eggs Benedict.  Repeat on the potatoes - those are not home fries by any stretch of the imagination.  Just horrible.  The Hollandaise sauce was so-so.    Good crowd.  Wish we had gone to Hideaway and let someone else have our table."}
{"text":"Always great food and great service!  The burgers and wings are terrific. We enjoyed the steak sandwich on the last visit, which was excellent. Also love their craft drinks!"}
{"text":"Nice place!  Met a few girlfriends for a b-day lunch, the staff was very accommodating...they did a great job w/ the cake and candles that one friend had brought in, and also snapped about a thousand pictures of us, per our group's numerous requests.  I had a draft beer that tasted so much better than it normally would have because of the fact that it was served in a mason jar.  And not surprisingly, I didn't eat anything...but...my friends' burgers and stuff all smelled delicious.  I think everyone was happy with their food, drinks, and service.  No complaints.  Nice, cozy atmosphere.  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Visited this place with my husband and daughter and the only good thing here was our waitress, Erica! She was all smiles and very enthusiastic, a great server!   Unfortunately the food here was not great! Everything from the appetizer to the dessert was poor tasting.  Had the Arizona burger and went with a medium well cook as they suggested.  When the burger came out it was well done and had a weird look to it.  Ordered some onion rings as a side to my burger and was surprised to see only 4 on my plate--yes that was the portion they gave me! Ordered a quesadilla for my daughter and I actually told her not to eat it because it looked so questionable and tasted so poor.  Probably won't come back here, was very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere,  decor,  and the service (our waitress) was great. But the food didn't wow me at all.  I had a California omlette with potatoes and a biscuit. The omlette was okay-bland, the biscuit was HUGE and great, but the potatoes were disappointing -they reminded me of those hash brown/ home fries that you can buy at the grocery store with the bell peppers in them. For the price of breakfast I hoped for a little more flavor over all."}
{"text":"Came out here with our neighbors and had a nice lunch. It was your simple pub style meals but they had a nice blackened salmon with spinach for 10$ on the seniors menu that my friends ordered that were the perfect size meals.  I had a the grown up grilled cheese which was very nice.   Service was good and we were also able to use our entertainment coupon and got one meal free so we were happy about this.  Overall a pleasant experience but food was average"}
{"text":"When thinking of my experience here and wishing I wrote it sooner since it's been a week since I've been here, I smile.  My hubby and I had a great time during happy hour here. We sat in the bar area and watched Monday night football while our friendly bartender, Christian, always made sure our mason jars were full. Yes, most drinks are served in mason jars, beers included. However, even with the nice array of craft beers on tap, we couldn't help but notice their whiskey selections. I ordered two whiskey cocktails, the South Paw and the Bird Dog peach Whiskey lemonade drinks, and they definitely packed a punch! They even serve moonshine cocktails as well.   Joey, the owner, (at least I think that's what his name was - it's hard to remember after having so many good cocktails - in a good way), was very well knowledgable about his whiskeys and is pondering doing whiskey flights at some point. He is very friendly and loves to hear what patrons of his restaurant have to say.   The bread pudding is out of this world good!! It'll have you dreaming of more once you leave so make sure you order this if nothing else.  Wings were good. I would order them spicy to get an extra kick because obviously mild just won't cut it.   I personally also enjoyed the full rack of ribs which were pretty tasty compared to the country fried chicken. The country fried chicken was tender, juicy, and really good but I expected it to be more like the unhealthy but decadent thick breading type that you'd get at LoLo's or Cracker Barrel and not the light breading that you'd find on chicken that's.. Well healthier. But it's covered in a queso sauce of some sort with diced peppers and other southwestern seasonings that made it enjoyable.  This restaurant is definitely going to be a permanent staple in our diets because we enjoyed the laid back atmosphere, friendly staff, good food, and whiskey."}
{"text":"Haymaker is my fav!! The best pulled pork sliders fried zucchini coleslaw & so much more. I've never had anything from this place that I didn't like; which is rare to find  these days. I'm totally hooked... Good food & excellent service! Everybody is really nice & treat ya like a human being instead of the typical treatment we've all become accustomed to at most places.   I've never had bad service & always had great food! Love my TX girl~ Jenna"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bite and liked the atmosphere.  I had fish & Chips, and my wife got a burger.  Both were good and the onion rings with the burger tasted great."}
{"text":"Nice environment and food but service is kinda whack. Our waitress passed us like 3 times and we said her name and she ignored us or just couldn't hear us and it was a struggle haha. But other than that it was okay. The waitress wasn't rude or anything but she was just not hearing us maybe?"}
{"text":"Everytime I come here I'm thrilled ! Food is amazing, service is great, and the prices are perfect."}
{"text":"It took this restaurant a few months to get their act together and I'm happy to say I think they have. The food has always been good; nothing fancy, but always full of flavor. Breakfast is really nice; I enjoy their biscuits and gravy. They have some pretty awesome salads and sandwiches too. NW Peoria is finally starting to develop."}
{"text":"1st time here for breakfast.  Stopped in with a friend. Breakfast menu had a great selection.  Both meals were excellent. Service was excellent too. Never and I mean never did I have to wait for a refill on my coffee.  And it's priced right. I'm sold."}
{"text":"Steak and salmon cooked perfectly. Wish it came with a salad or bread. Service was very friendly. Lots of TVs in the bar. Hopefully, this restaurant succeeds at this location."}
{"text":"Food and service was awesome!  Best pull pork sandwich and hubby said his steak was delicious!"}
{"text":"Tried The Haymaker tonight and it was nice. Our waiter was great but I think the kitchen was a little uncoordinated with our food but wasn't that big of a deal. Food was very good. The apple cider vinaigrette dressing on my salad was the star of the evening, absolutely delicious, but I wish it wouldn't have had the blue cheese crumbles on it, not my taste. Had the BBQ chicken and half rack of ribs, both very good, rib meat was fall of the bone tender. Had a little kick too. All in all it was good though a little pricey. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the grilled pickles and the BLT Sandwich. I would avoid the fried green tomato (with my sandwich which had avocado it became mushy). We also had the chicken fried steak and chicken fried chicken which was very enjoyable. The chili was pretty good. Overall it was a good dining experience and we will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"So, we're traveling across Arizona heading back home to California and starving.  We stopped at a little restaurant called the Haymaker! We walked & immediately see a huge American flag covering the wall, Pledge of Allegiance on another wall, & Grace on another! Love this place at 1st sight! We were greeted with a very warm & friendly welcome & seated promptly.  It's very difficult for us to find someplace to eat because we're both gluten-free & we are used to having to explain \"no bread\" etc... Turns out, they have gluten-free breads & stuff!  Great Food! Great Service! Great Price! Oh, & GREAT MUSIC!  I highly recommend Haymakers!"}
{"text":"Ok place to grab a drink and some food which is mid grade at best. Service always good and you always get what you pay."}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome! And if you like whiskey like I do, they have FLIGHTS of whiskey, similar to how you can order a flight of wine -- haha, how cool!! But seriously, if you love great southern American food, this is a GREAT bet! Something for everyone!"}
{"text":"We had the huevos and western Benedicts; awesome! Eggs were poached perfectly, all of the white was cooked and the yoke was runny. Plenty of sauce."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times - it's convenient to where we live and the food is good. The parking could be better, but it's not really their fault - just a side effect of the location mostly.  Their ribs are pretty darn respectable and the burgers are good.  Edit:  I have to add that they have the MOST AMAZING steak sandwich, which goes extremely well with their onion rings."}
{"text":"Checked outHaymaker's for the first time with husband and mother-in-law. We had fish and chips, the Arizona burger and the Lariat burger. Food is good but a little bland. They could use a few more seasonings in the Cajun fries and more salt and pepper on the burgers.   Very nice atmosphere.Very nice staff , Grabriella, was our waitress.   Overall a little expensive for what you get,but we will give them another try."}
{"text":"Hardly anyone in the restaurant. We were seated promptly. Waited 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge our presence. Sadly the waiter walked past (back and forth) 4 times and acted as though we weren't there.  Left and went next door, where we were seated and order taken plus drinks delivered in about 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Very nice, clean and quiet restaurant. I had the Fish and chips. fish was cod and I opted for the spicy Cajun fries. Very large portion of fish which I could not finish. It was excellent and served hot. My wife had the Bacon, lettuce avacodo and deep fried tomato (BLAT) She loved it. this was our first time here and we are coming back. Priced right too"}
{"text":"Not impressed. It's 108 degrees in Phoenix today and the restaurant is not pumping out A/C. So hot and uncomfortable in here. Then forks are dirty. Gross. Eggs were ordered over medium and the white party was slimy and runny. Potatoes were not cooked. Was an expensive and disappointing meal. Will never go again."}
{"text":"Love the down home atmosphere! Very rustic americana decor. Been here a few times now (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). The service is consistent every time. Prompt, friendly, knowledgable. The food is awesome and they have a great draft beer selection considering it has a smaller bar. And for the ladies, there are mimosas at breakfast. So happy to have them in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in north Peoria! Love love love the egg sandwich!  And the country potatoes are where it's at!"}
{"text":"Food is decent, service is hit or miss. It's been amazing at times and it's been less than stellar.  They are always friendly but just forgetful at times.  The food is inexpensive and they have a kids eat free night."}
{"text":"Great local spot for breakfast, lunch or dinner. The Haymaker has a hometown feel and the food is good. Wait staff are friendly and provide prompt service without making one feel rushed."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast and it was amazing. My guest and I ordered the Arizona omelet.  The green Chili's and salsa were not too spicy, they were just right. The eggs were so fluffy and light.  Service was great. Mike took amazing care of us. He was so friendly, i will go back and ask for him again next time. My coffee was full through out the entire meal.  As far as the decor goes, it was all American country themed. Very welcoming. I would love to try the dinner there some time. I also noticed they have some great dinner for 2 specials throughout the week. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Took the parents to this place on Saturday. Service was kinda slow, food was not hot and lots of parents with their screaming kids. This was early afternoon, so I'm sure the kids won't be there in the later evening."}
{"text":"Its unfortunate the food doesn't have the same pleasing look as the restaurant itself. I had the fish and chips which was just ok. My wife had the fried chicken and you would expect a piece of fried chicken breast to be prepared and cooked to perfection since there isn't much that will help it taste better. They serve it with a gravy that is supposed to mask the lack of taste in the chicken but it's more of a chowder. The meal prices should reflect quality, it was a 13.00 meal that should have cost 7.99."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Service needs improvement. Not friendly at all. Discount not what was advertised at spring training game."}
{"text":"I came here on a recommendation from a friend who lives in the area and had a coupon. My party of four was seated quickly, but the host could have been a bit more cordial.  Ordered drinks-nice selection of draft beer.  Drinks came in a reasonable amount of time.  We weren't ready to order and the waitress came back-took her time.  I ordered the Rhythm Hot Bone-in wings, wife ordered a burger w/ steamed veggies and kids had ribs/chix fingers.  Took a few minutes longer than expected, but the quality of food was worth the wait.  The Rhythm Hot was one of the best wing sauces I have ever had.  Out tab was just short of the $50 for a $10 discount but the manager gave it to us anyways.  We all decided this is our new \"Chilis\" night out."}
{"text":"I don't live in this area, but my friend does. She suggested we go for a late breakfast. We got mimosas and ordered from the lunch menu. I liked it so much, my boyfriend and I went for breakfast today. Never disappointed. I got the pigs in a blanket, sausage wrapped in buttermilk pancakes. It was soooo good. Will be coming again. And again and again"}
{"text":"This is my fourth time here and my third for breakfast. It's an interesting place.  The first time we came, it was kind of meh, but I have to say that since then, it's really improved. It's our favorite local spot - we can roll out of bed and basically be here.  The coffee is pretty good. The hollandaise is delicious. The hashbrowns are tasty. I'll update as I have more in the future.  Whoever upped the standards here, thank you. It definitely paid off."}
{"text":"This place does the soup, salad, and sandwich gig exceptionally well. The French dip and side salad that I ordered were delicious, and perfectly portioned. Service was solid, even though we were there during a late lunch rush that they were plainly not expecting. If you're looking for a restaurant that pushes culinary boundaries, you'll be disappointed as they don't offer much in the way of fusion food. But if you're in the mood for classic favorites that are well prepared, you'd be hard pressed to find better on this side of Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great selection of tap beers and great burgers!  New favorite happy hour.  Menu is a nice selection of burgers,  sandwiches,  salads, and a variety of entrees at great prices.  Atmosphere was cozy and comfortable.   Bonus that it is locally owned."}
{"text":"Whitney the server was not good. Never noticed that I didn't eat my horrible AND cold meal. Wasn't personable OR attentive. This place should just stick to serving drinks."}
{"text":"Great fun atmosphere and fantastic food! No matter what you get you'll totally love it. Great service and friendly staff. First time here and The barbecue pork sandwich with frings is definitely a must.  Want something different, they have a whole menu with good comfort food with a great modern twist for today's modern pallet that can be accompanied with many specialty drinks from the bar. ."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Haymaker last night and we were talking about coming back before we even left! We went to this location about 4 years ago and were not impressed, but we thought we would try it again. This time, the food was outstanding and the gluten free menu had MANY options to choose from! The children's menu even offers gluten free items, and our kids loved it! The service was top notch and the manager Ryan was very helpful to answer our questions about the gluten free menu, along with just being a genuinely nice guy! We will DEFINITELY be back, and it won't be four years like last time."}
{"text":"Tried to eat there today. Three at reception but 20 minutes after being seated right by them, we hadn't even received water or saw a server.  Got up and left. Not a single comment.  Apparently CUSTOMERS are not key to thier business."}
{"text":"Bad general experience.  I bought a groupon and went for breakfast. There were plenty of open tables, but the waitresses were stressed with the orders; young man at hostess station asked us to sit at bar and wait 7-10, for the \"rush\" to slow down. He was very pleasant, brought coffee and water.  After we were seated, the same male hostess came and took our order, he wasn't familiar with the menu, but he was trying to help.  40 minute wait for our food, which was meh, could of had the same at Denny's.  We didn't have a waitress, so no one came back to the table to refill drinks or check on the food, except same male hostess stopped to see if we were ok.  Flagged down a waitress for the check, 10 minutes later a different waitress dropped it off.  She took my groupon which was $20 toward food.  Total bill was $22.37.  Then a different waitress came back and said, she could only take $15 off the bill because I needed to pay the tax. (Tax was $1.87)  and she had already run my card for $7.35, instead of the $2.35  I use Groupons towards new restaurants all the time and this is a first.    I'll never go back because food was not great and they didn't honor the Groupon as sold."}
{"text":"great spot, really good burgers, good staff, I only wish it was closer"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and you can get them on a pretzel bun! Our server (Kerry) was great and the service was fast!  Awesome job kitchen and crew!"}
{"text":"Hands down my new favorite place to eat. They have THE BEST ROOTBEER I have ever had. It's almost like it is homemade. Went there for breakfast with my friend her boyfriend. Out service was a little slow but the in my mind, the rootbeer made up for that. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"If I could give them 0 stars unfortunately I would. The service was bad from the start, not welcoming at all here's our menu, I might be back. Oh you want a drink? Too bad you will have to wait. Finally they take our order, and bring our drinks, we should have ordered water. Then the meal came the chicken was good, the potatoes were okay, and the onion rings were perfect. The burger was unbearable couldn't even be eaten. Oh and what ever you do don't order the Apple pie alamode, it tasted like burnt plastic when we told the waitress we couldn't eat it she got pissed ... Stormed off and said nothing eventually she came back and all she had to say was, my manager took it off your bill. And that was it we paid she slammed some chairs and we left."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Food was pretty good, not extraordinary. Service was okay, not exceptional. Ambiance was okay. Everything was fine, just not beyond the norm."}
{"text":"Truly awful!  Got the bandit burger, Asian chicken salad, grilled cheese, and boneless wings.  Took a maximum of 3-4 bites of each before throwing them out.   The burger was dry, uninteresting, and the chili that was to be placed on it likely came from a budget seasoning packet.   Grilled cheese comprised of Kraft slices and lousy burned bread.  No flavor! Asian chicken salad had little redeeming value, the dressing was thrown out after a couple bites, chicken soggy.   The boneless wings were wet and had no sauce, unfortunately the best thing ordered, but still very disappointing."}
{"text":"Food is descent, staff is usually courteous. Breakfast is only served until 1030 during the week. They have a selection of whiskey that some other places lack. Not blown away by this place but it is an ok place to come hang out with some friends for a drink and a bite after work. Not too bad for breakfast as they have omelettes, french toast, eggs benedict and the like, if you make it on time."}
{"text":"We moved nearby and keep getting ads and coupons in the mail, so thought we'd give it a try.  Not what I was expecting. Very underwhelmed. My husband and I eat healthy(ish) and wanted to go out for some good salads. The Haymaker has about 8 salad options, all seemingly somewhat unique, so we stopped in.  I had the strawberry avocado salad for $12. This salad is literally spinach, 6 slices of red onion, a tiny bit of feta cheese, half an avocado and maybe 5/6 slices strawberries. Way overpriced. I have no issue paying $15 for a properly made, creative, bountiful salad.   My husband got the side salad (which is the Haymaker salad- mixed greens, tomato, croutons,feta) with cup of soup -chicken tortilla. This was $8 so a bit more reasonable. He asked for no feta- it came with feta. The soup was so salty that it felt like it burnt your mouth. My husband literally puts salt on his bag popcorn and he felt the soup was too salty.   At first I thought ... maybe we should expect decent salads from a country - style American food restaurant... BUT  then I remembered all the wonderful salads I've had at steak houses and other establishments known for their seafood/steak/burgers.   Looking around it seemed that everyone had ordered deep fried food with a cocktail/beer.  We'll come back and try happy hour .. looks like they have well priced drinks and sliders/ fried items."}
{"text":"Food was good and mimosa was decent. Went here for brunch and sat at the bar to avoid the long wait since it was Sunday morning. Someone greeted me and got me a mimosa but I had to ask to order food. Was here with my Mum and our orders took wayyy too long to arrive and the bar tenders pretty much avoided us and weren't attentive. I could have left without paying and doubt they would have even noticed. Their bar employees need to pay better attention and they need to step up their service."}
{"text":"Had the Arizona burger with grilled chicken. Definitely worth the $10 with the Cajun fries. My wife has a salad that seemed a bit \"lacking\", but the rest of the party had burgers and they were solid. Beer selection was really good and they had plenty of TVs for college football. Definitely an upgrade over the previous proprietor. Oh, fried pickles were really good as well."}
{"text":"The best Moscow Mule and wings!  The side salad   Was even delish!  Our waiter was friendly and made honest recommendations. The best blackened catfish too! You must try it! The bread pudding was to die for too!!! Yum yum!"}
{"text":"I just found this place.  It is delicious.  I had breakfast and lunch there.  Great service and really good food.  Always crowded."}
{"text":"I visited this place once for lunch hamburgers and once for Thursday Night Football beers.  When I came for lunch and ordered a special burger, the waiter announced that the default cooking status for the burgers at this place was medium-well.  That was a signal to me that the meat was not quality if you need to overcook it to medium-well, even given that many folks eat their ground beef well done.  Not a great experience the first time.  I went back for wings and beer on a Thursday football night and the bar was well-attended.  The draft beer offerings included good local choices and I wound up with a couple of Scottsdale Blonde Kolsch in a mason jar.  The hot wings were plump and had a great flavor from pepper instead of the standard buffalo/tabasco.  Those wings are great.  The wait staff was terrific on Thursday night, even with a relatively busy bar.  I asked about the burgers and the waitress told me they use 80/20 beef and will cook to order.  I will have to try the burgers again ... but only if they run out of wings."}
{"text":"The server was exceptionally accommodating. I like the large, spacious cabin-like feel of the place. As for the burger itself, it was savory and so filling, I don't think I ate again for an entire day. I believe it had the word \"bypass\" in it's name, but I survived it. It was a vegetarian's worst nightmare, but a meat-lover's dream come true.  I should note that this is another restaurant that I hold in high regards for their appreciation of our servicemen. They comped the entire meal on Memorial Day, and it's safe to say they probably do something similar on Veterans Day."}
{"text":"Two stars only because our server was fantastic. Otherwise, they were out of three different listed drink items. The  bartender was extremely rude. Will never come back."}
{"text":"Warm salad ,  decent pastrami ,water down blue cheese dressing as you enter the front doors their cigarette butts all over the place just gives you the feeling of not that impressed with how they take care of the place food mediocre don't think I'll be going back"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere and friendly service!  Sean was our server, very attentive and knowledgable.....food was great and swift to table, definitely recommend the rhythm wings and the pineapple habenero!  Salads were delicious as well with the clearly fresh homemade croutons!  We will definitely be back to try a whiskey flight!"}
{"text":"Good beer, good food, good service. What else?  Stopped by here for late lunch on weekend and I really enjoyed their ambiance, very good local beer, friendly service and food.  They have happy hour all afternoon and local beer is $4. Some beer is only $2 should you prefer.  I ordered darkest beer they had and it was rich and creamy, I liked their dark beer.  My grilled cheese was served with bacon, avocado, and some others, it's not traditional grilled cheese we used to eat as a kid, their adult grilled cheese is quite filling and good.  Our server had a nice smile and he was friendly.  Really liked their decor, they support military and nice to see that on their walls.  If I am in the area, I would come back again"}
{"text":"Just got home from dinner. Very good burgers and fries! The burgers were cooked perfectly and neither the burgers or fries were over-salted. Our server Courtney was very good too. Definitely will give all the area restaurants a run for their money if tonight is the norm. Way to go, Haymaker!"}
{"text":"Just not a huge fan. I love bold flavors and just think the food is average. The barbeque pork with fries is probably my favorite and would give the dish a 4 out of 5, just not loving any other dish I have had. The chicken, salads, and the burgers are to me just average. I know they have a large alcohol selection which if I drank would probably cause me to give an extra star or two, but I do not so that is that. Anyway, it is not bad just not great."}
{"text":"We visited this place on a Saturday around 12:30 the joint was jumping and tables were tough to find. I literally crashed into our server, the comely Jennifer. She's a sturdy lass.     The Texan burger comes with bacon, cheese, fried onions with whiskey BBQ sauce, with a big side of sweet potato fries and this was a winner.     The country-fried steak showed up smothered in sawmill gravy on top of a major-league biscuit with hashed brown potatoes and scrambled eggs.    The onion rings were corn-battered and crispy. We washed this all down draft beer and Merlot at Happy Hour pricing."}
{"text":"Awesome place to go!! First place I stopped at and the entire family enjoyed everything. Definitely appreciate the military and would recommend anyone to make sure they stop by."}
{"text":"This place has always given my wife and I some seriously fast and friendly service. We're big into BBQ and whiskey, and they have those things covered in spades! Plus, we love that it is a small business and not a national chain, so more of our money goes to support AZ and AZ families."}
{"text":"We hosted a mixer at the Haymaker recently and with their help, it turned out to be a tremendous success. They were so welcoming and had everything set up perfect for our event. I truly believe that the reason why it went so smoothly was because of the location that we held the event at. Not only were they accommodating but the staff was great as well. We gave out drink tickets to the clients that came to the mixer and the bartenders were so attentive, calling me by my first name, and giving me exceptional service. I will defiantly be going back and bringing friends along with me,"}
{"text":"Breakfast is where it's at! The service was excellent as always.  Thank you Joe for your hospitality!  We had Javier as a server for the 3rd time, he is always exceptional!"}
{"text":"Blackened Salmon & side Vegetables were awesome! Our waitress was great. she made our first experience wonderful. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Their fried chicken and gravy was delicious. Their sandwiches and burgers are also great. As an added bonus they serve breakfast all day. Great selection of beers and whiskey too!"}
{"text":"Not good. Really wanted this place to be OK. Had to ask for a drink menu. Drinks took forever. My ribs were greasy. I ordered French fries, did not get them. My son left his burger as it was not good and he eats  anything. He needed a new fork (not their fault) The server never came back to check to make sure everything was OK so had to flag her down as she walked by. My wife's sandwich was good but when she asked for a to-go box the server bought a box for the half sandwich that had no room for the sides. By the time the manager came by to check on us we had decided we were not going back."}
{"text":"3.5 starts. So far so good. I was there a few weeks ago for brunch with my 5:30am bootcamp crew. They have been numerous times before but this particular time, we kept getting reprimanded for being too loud. EEK! We were trying to keep the noise level to a 7 (instead of a 13) but when there are almost 20 of us there for brunch, it can be a little hard to do (but we managed, after many stern looks) The food and service were good. My only gripe is that when you order the Haymaker Breakfast sandwich and you ask repeated please, please do not put mayo on the sandwich and yet when you get it, it has EXTRA mayo, their is a problem. I did not want to send it back as I didn't want to be that person, but I was disappointed that I had to take a napkin and wipe off an ridiculous amount of mayo. That being said, is my only gripe, otherwise everything else was ok. Will I be back, of course as the gang really seems to like this place and for the most part, so do I."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my wife and was barely greeted and rushed to our table.  The chicken fingers and fries (~11) were seemingly of the frozen-variety ... the salad was wilted and the roasted almonds slightly burned (~$12).  Certainly not worth the price, and not enjoyable. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great service.  The staff was sweet and attentive to our needs. The food was served in a timely manner. Portion size was wonderful.  I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"All star cast at bar! Personalize service from Travis and Kathy! Always feel super special at the bar from those two! Definite keepers!"}
{"text":"Decent breakfast, prices, staff, atmosphere. Nothing amazing but it's very reliable and they are always consistent and that is wonderful!"}
{"text":"I normally go here to have casual business meetings and had never actually had a full meal, and I'm sorry to say I never will again after my last visit. My guests and I ordered the chicken buffalo sandwhich, chicken salad, and grilled chicken plate. The only full plate of food was the salad. The other plates literally had more plate than food on them. The chicken sandwhich came with 5 onion rings and the chicken plate has the smallest piece of chicken you could imagine and a very small servings of veggies. There was so little food on these plates it was hard not to notice. On top of that none of my guests finished their small plate of food which says something about the taste. Let's just say I was embarrassed. I will not be going back, not even for a casual business meeting. Don't like the feeling of being ripped off. I recommend to this place to at least add a salad to the plate so it doesn't look so empty, and for 12 dollars a plate you wouldn't be asking for too much."}
{"text":"The cowboy platter made me sick and the waiter seems weird... Either buy another food from the menu or just don't go there"}
{"text":"What a great addition to the Phoenix restaurant scene. We were there this evening and we're so very pleasantly surprised. Fried pickles were GREAT..I had the Bandit burger, a chile smothered burger and my husband had the AZ burger.  This was green chile's and sautéed onions on the burger. The quality of the beef patty was excellant. Very good service and hands on management overseeing the entire team. Food 5 star, Service 5 star, value for your dollar 5 star. Try to catch the deal on groupon if you are reading this. Either way the prices are very reasonable and the quality is high!"}
{"text":"The Haymaker is a good place to eat. Good god. Good service. I'll be back to try something new!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were seated at approximately 6:55 PM. Our waiter came over and suggested we order before the party of eight did so we would get our food sooner. We ordered. At 7:20 the party of eight got their food! We waited until 7:27 ( we were starving) and walked to the front counter said we were leaving and that their service was terrible. They offered us a free meal but we were afraid. It was then we noticed the couple next to our booth were getting served and they had arrived after us as well. All by the same server. Please be aware service can be dreadful and made to wait on not that busy an evening! Good luck!"}
{"text":"We attempted to eat here but after waiting for 20 minutes to be greeted & have our order taken, we walked out. It's a shame because the food listed on the menu seemed liked it would be good."}
{"text":"Went at 11 on Fathers Day. Kitchen was shut down for an hour so they could catch up. Would have been good if they told us that when we out our name in the list and before we overheard it being told to someone else after waiting 20 minutes. Customer service fail."}
{"text":"Although our visit was not the best experience, I would go back, if ever in the area again. The manager took the time to message me and apologize. I am very impressed, as this is a rare occurrence. Excellent customer service from the management!"}
{"text":"6 of us went for lunch, and everyone liked what the ordered.  Extensive menu with reasonable prices.  Will be returning."}
{"text":"The apple French toast was tough and the business was more interested in their beer and red-necked patriotic symbols than menu. However, I was not charged for the dry, tough toast."}
{"text":"This place has surprisingly great food.  I say that because it's a simple-looking restaurant that appears more like a diner than a high end restaurant.  But they pull off some really great things, from the breakfasts to dinners.  Their pasta dishes are impressive in the quality and abundance of the expensive items like large shrimp.  Service has always been smooth and friendly.  After about five visits here, I can say they are consistent and there have been no issues."}
{"text":"Going in to grab a quick beer at 8:15 on a Sunday. They're posted hours say they close at 9pm. As I get out of my car one of them employees rushes to the door to lock up and shut the blinds. Service of the year!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place and the service was so friendly. I made sure to let the manager know about what a great job the  waitress did and they were also very nice. Great onion rings, fried pickles, pork chops, and chicken fried steak. I want to try so much more. I also heard the donated Thanksgiving dinner to the firefighters that had work on the holiday at Luke AFB. Bravo to them!"}
{"text":"First time here. Loved the atmosphere and decor in this place, a friendly and comfortable vibe overall. The place seems pretty busy so obviously they have a good customer base. The host and wait staff were friendly, timely, and efficient. We came for breakfast, and the menu was pretty ordinary, all the basics of a tasty breakfast were on there.  The food, unfortunately, was just okay. I think the hash browns were possibly frozen, they were a bit soggy on the inside though crispy on the outside. My husband loves chicken fried steak so he gave it a try, it was a good size portion but a little greasy/soggy when he got into it. I got pancakes, bacon, hashbrowns, and eggs, all of which were just okay, nothing out of the ordinary. Prices were a little higher than I would have liked to see for breakfast and the experience was not any better than a Denny's or IHOP. That being said, I will probably end up going back to one of those places in the future to save a few dollars.  Overall it was a good experience,  we may come back in the evening sometime to see if their dinners are any better."}
{"text":"A-OK as Yelp puts 3 stars. Pretty standard breakfast fare. i had the Arizona omelet as a scramble and I subbed out my toast and hashbrowns for a buckwheat pancacke (i love a good nutty buckwheat cake of the pan -- it was decent, nothing spesh). I also added chorizo to the scramble, which i would recommend otherwise it lacks some flavor. The child had pancakes -- the child pancakes are a pretty hearty serving, I would have had trouble mowing all that food down. Very reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere. This restaurant creates a great place to eat and drink. It has a bar area that makes for a great place to watch a game or catch up with friends. I was attracted there by their beer menu but will go back for the ambiance."}
{"text":"Burgers are good. Can't believe a place with such a selection of draft beer does not have chilled glasses for your beer. Waiter told me that they don't do that. If you want a good cold.draft beer, this is not the place.  My friends bottled beer was barely colder than room temp.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"We have been here for breakfast and dinner, both were very good!!! Great food and prices are not bad either.  The biscuits at breakfast are amazing!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went in for brunch today with the family for the first time. The restaurant is nice with a few TVs, bar, and rustic decor. They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner all day long and have a great happy hour menu. Tons of food to choose from. Be a great place for game day! $3 mimosas and bloody Mary's for weekend brunch.   Our server was Krystal and she was fantastic. Very nice, prompt service, and helped recommend items from the menu. I got the senior(small) bbq chicken salad. It was huge for a small and was very tasty with a ton of flavor. I also got a cup of chili that was rich and delicious. My husband got the haymaker Benedict that was huge but he loved it! The chicken was crisp and was smothered with a chipotle cream sauce.   Overall everything was really good from the service to the food. Excited to come back to try more things. They even have those good root beer barrels to take to go as you leave."}
{"text":"A true diamond ! The food is excellent with a wide variety of American favorites and a good selection of house specialties. The staff is very welcoming and willing to explain any questions. Beyond that, the whiskey selection is awesome. Hand picked by the owner, you will find everything from Pappy Van Winkle to rare Beams (YOU know what I'm talking about) ! The staff is surprisingly knowledgable about the whiskey. Prices are very reasonable. All this makes for a great evening out."}
{"text":"Great food! Had the pastrami with onion rings. I got six onion rings and the server stated I should have seven. She went back to the kitchen and had one more made. How nice. Price was right and great food!"}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner. Service was less than par and food was just okay. Will be a while before I visit again."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I stopped in one Friday night expecting it to be busy and were surprised by how dead it was. We were sat down and instantly started sweating.. I don't know why it was so hot in there but I am normally cold and I was feeling toasty. We looked at the menu and were not impressed by the options and were hot so we left before ordering. I would love to say that we will be back to try it again but I don't know that we will. First impressions were not good. Maybe we will try for breakfast since that is what everyone loves here. We will see."}
{"text":"Food is much better than you expect given the first impression.  The pulled pork sliders appetizer could be a meal - three mid sized sandwiches. The pork was very good with a nice BBQ sauce. The hidden pickle on a pulled pork sandwich was an unpleasant surprise.  The french dip (beef dip) is a solid beef sandwich. The key ingredient, the meat, was tender and finely shaved. The bun was soft, which I prefer, but a bit vacant of flavour, I prefer  wheaty flavor. I find the Swiss cheese a bit too strong for a beef dip, it overpowers the bread and meat. A provolone would work better. The a jus was a bit weak and watery - a bit low on beefiness. I ordered without the mushrooms and onions so can't comment on that.  The bread pudding dessert hit the spot. Soft and substantial but not overly heavy or dense. The ice cream tasted a step or two above the econo brands so they didn't cheap out.  Decor... There's so much to say. A bit slipshod in workmanship, a bit disorganized in design. Too many ill placed TVs. A lot of room for improvement.   Service is friendly and personal, but a bit low on professionalism - but that must be what they are going for. I prefer informal yet sharp, professional service.  Fewer original twists to the food - stick to normal food, an updated decor (lots to say here), and some staff training and this place would hit it out of the park. Clearly they know how to make a good meal - the basic building block of any restaurant.   Lots of potential."}
{"text":"It was a Friday morning and our first time here. We were greeted nicely and seated in a booth. The booth and duct tape. The tape has been used and abused. It was in the middle so I had to sit on the side or the glue would be on my butt. When the guy sat us there he didn't even offer to move us to another spot. And the place wasn't full. The waitress was nice. I got the California omelette. I'm gluten sensitive so I had to go with and omelet or nothing. My husband got the chicken fried steak. He was not impressed. It was a frozen patty. The biscuit is fresh but that's was it with his meal. My hash browns had a weird metal taste. Two meals with water plus tax for $23. So the amount of food for the price is good!"}
{"text":"This was my first trip to this restaurant. We went for breakfast and I must say we were very pleased. The portions are huge and the food is really good. I got the banana pecan caramel pancakes and he got this Mexican style eggs Benedict that was amazing.  I will tell you that I felt that our waiter was kind of snooty with us however that would not stop me from going back. I believe in giving everybody the benefit of the doubt and if in the future he's there and continues to have the attitude I'll just ask for a different waitress. I definitely won't let a snooty waiter keep me from enjoying amazing food. They are doing a remodel as of yesterday so it'll be interesting to see what the restaurant looks like once the remodel is done."}
{"text":"Havent disliked anything yet, and have been in a handful of times!! Great locally owned restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service! You can't go wrong for breakfast. The Haymaker Benedict was one of the best breakfast dishes I've had in a while.  Paige served us with a smile and excellent service! You got to give it a try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Upon entering, greeted by a bartender yelling \"we are closed!\". Upon seating, waited 10 mins and still no waiter greeting. Got up and left. Never come here!!"}
{"text":"Paul our waiter was very busy but got our drink order in shortly after we were seated. He was Johnny on the spot with drinks, food and answering any questions we might have for him concerning the food, restaurant, etc. I thought my Gringo Burger was just mediocre, saying that I will return as I love what this restaurant stands for!"}
{"text":"I truly enjoyed the breakfast at the Haymaker! It could have used some seasoning, but overall large portions and tasty. The server was great and she was always checking back to make sure that we were satisfied. We will definitely be back. I think we'll try lunch next time!"}
{"text":"First let me say the staff was friendly and responsive. The staff was young and not seasoned service personnel. My fiancé and I sat in the lounge area and there were fruit flies buzzing around us. A larger non-fruit fly flew into my hair and got stuck and a third unknown small black fly landed on the table. This all happened during our stay. My fiancé ordered the chicken fried chicken and it was good. I had the AZ burger and it was okay, the patties are obviously frozen, the patty and onions were greasy. It appears the staff to no fault of their own need to be trained and the owners are just trying to build a franchise restaurant. The whiskey menu is big but prices are ridiculously high, stay home BBQ and buy your own whiskey. This place could be great but due to the flys and young staff this place is no better than a Denny's with a pretentious whiskey bar."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with V.  When we walked in they asked if we wanted to sit the bar area or regular dinning.  We choice the regular dinning, so we can chit chat since we have not seen each other in awhile.  Got out our drink orders right away.  I got the patty melt w/french fries.  It was ok, more seasoning on the burger would be nice.  The service was great.  Need to get up early to try breakfast next time."}
{"text":"Breakfast was really good. Had the one egg with hashbrowns and wheat toast. Hubby had biscuits and gravy and said they were awesome. Service lacked but food made up for it."}
{"text":"Had  haymaker for dinner tonight for the first time $14 for a steak sandwich that had no meat and didn't even look like steak. Hamburger is small as a McDonald's Mc double lacked in all areas. pastrami sandwich look like deli pastrami warmed on the grill very disappointing, spent $50 on a meal that wasn't even worthy of McDonald's dollar menu do not recommend...will not return. Prices were extremely high.  Review pictures misleading."}
{"text":"I was here tonight and the server was rude and the place wasn't busy. I got a side salad before my main entree came out and had to send it back because it was brown! So they gave another and still brown but... it had a hair.... WTF! Then my main entree came and it was cold.... This place went down the hill. Never coming back here. The bathroom smelled."}
{"text":"MILITARY MEMBERS SHOUKD EAT HERE!!!  20% military discount!!!!  We eat here every time we drive through Phoenix on our way to San Diego.  The food is absolutely amazing and the portions are very generous.  Service is also very good.  Never had lunch or dinner here yet."}
{"text":"My husband, adult son and myself ate dinner here on Friday, January 29th. We bought a Groupon so we could try this restaurant.  We were greeted right away after entering the restaurant by the hostess. We were seated at a table and given menus. I told the waitress that we had a groupon so there wouldn't be any surprises as some restaurants forbid the use of a groupon for their specials. I ordered the fish and chips, my husband ordered the Texas Burger and my son ordered a bowl of clam chowder.  We didn't have to wait very long before our waitress brought out piping, hot food. Everything tasted delicious. The fish was tender and crispy. The coleslaw was delightful with a good amount of dressing. My son's clam chowder was thick with fresh, small chunks of clams. My husband's Texas Burger was medium well. The burger was thick and juicy with the right amount of seasonings. Our waitress made sure our ice teas and Pepsi was refilled and she checked on us often. She was friendly. The restaurant is clean and has the right amount of staff. We liked it so much that we will return. Their menu has a lot to choose from and the prices are comparable to other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This is the go to place if you want comfort food, at a great price, with good service. Sal and the other bartenders have never let me down, and when I come in with my kids and wife we have never been let down."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast and only 3 other couples in the restaurant and waited 10 mins for anyone to come to the table and another 35 mins before the food arrived and it was cold. Coffee tasted as if it was from last night and no one came by to ask if you wanted  a refill or stop by at all. Haymaker used to be a nice place but now they are more focused on building their brand name and promoting their distillery. They obviously forgot about the core values that they were trying to build on good service and good food. Go to the place on bell road and you will know what a quality breakfast and service is.Would give 0 stars if possible."}
{"text":"My family and I came in to have dinner before the drive-ins. Turned out it was happy hour, cool, half off pints of beer.   We all decided to get burgers, cooked to order, it states. Great, we like our burgers rare and our kids like theirs medium-rare. We asked if this could be done, for our kids, before ordering. Advised it could. Well, the kids burger came out well done, seriously. Med-rare and we get well done. sent it back. Second go the manager brought the kids burger out saying med-rare. Well, I would say, after cutting it in half that one side was medium at best and the other was med-well. Definitely not MEDIUM RARE. Now comes out our burgers , 1/2# mind you, we ordered ours RARE. Of course I cut mine in half, as it's easier to eat , and it's medium. Medium, warm and pink in the middle not cold and red in the middle! I check with my wife and hers is medium as well. We decide to send it back and NOT reorder  as we didn't want to waste anymore food.    The manager decides to come out and state that both burgers were medium rare and just a smidge off of rare and that when they looked at them under the light they were still a little bloody. I decide not to disagree with him as it's just not worth it, however, I do not like my intelligence insulted. People shouldn't assume you done know how to cook and what you are talking about. I use to be a cook for a restaurant and my station was the grill.  Here is how meat should be cooked: Rare - pink, cold in the middle, and soft Medium rare - pink, warm in the middle, and soft Medium - pink and firm Medium well - a hint of pink and firm Well done - brown in the middle and firm.  THAT'S HOW MEAT SHOULD BE COOKED.  Thanks for the rant and Haymaker, don't try and defend a poor cook that doesn't know how to cook. Spend some money on a good cook and you'll probably have better monthly profits on food sales!"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this restaurant. When we came in, we decided we were going to order burgers. My husband ordered the green chile burger and I got the gringo. They messed up our order and brought us both green chile burgers (not a problem...usually)...I let the waiter know the mixup. He leaves for a bit as I enjoy my sweet potatoe fries and ranch. He then rushed back and asks if he can have my plate that they \"don't believe him\" in the back. DEFINITELY not something to tell the customer. After waiting quite a while I get my burger, and there's no longer ranch with my fries (waaaa, but at this point I'm hungry and tired of waiting). The burger is gross and I eat a few bites. I should've kept the mix up from the beginning. The waiter then came back at the end and gave us these gamut of excuses as to why we received such poor service. It was really ridiculous actually. I don't think we will ever be going back unless maybe just to drink whiskey."}
{"text":"Delightfully surprise.  Great food, very attentive & blow your  mind so pleasant server - Katie.  Thanks for a great dining experience!  Pay them a visit, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Had the huevos benidictos, eggs Benedict and Dutch Apple French toast. None of the food was bad but it wasn't great either. They used frozen store bought potatoes for the country potatoes and pre-made frozen hash browns. The apples over the French toast tasted like they came out of a can and didn't have much flavor.   The restaurant is clean and the service is good which is why I went 3 stars instead of 2."}
{"text":"All we wanted was breakfast. How can you $@#$& up a breakfast?  I asked for the bacon and potatoes crispy, and was the fruit fresh. That's all.  Not hard, right?  Wrong.  Potatoes O'Brien must be canned. Sent them back for  crispy, came back the same way, not even close.  Bacon was so salty, I couldn't even eat it.  Who can't eat bacon? Last was the \"fresh\" fruit.  Mind you,I asked was it fresh before I ordered it. Got it, sure not even close to fresh.  Manager came over and explained, \"It's fresh fruit, cut up, placed in its juices and sent to us in a bag.  Wow, really?  Best thing there was the manager who comped the whole meal since it was inedible. Zero stars...but it won't post with zero"}
{"text":"Nope.    First time was right after they opened and the service was terrible and the food was \"meh\" at best.  Assumed it was just because they needed to get the kinks out.  Second time we go in and we're seated at a booth and told our server would be \"right with us\" .. it was dinner time, so busy, but open tables and no waiting, so not crazy.  We waited around ten minutes and the server finally came over, apologized for the wait, and took our drink order (water all around, pretty easy) and since we had waited so long, we placed our food orders.  About 20 minutes later, our food arrives.  Still no drinks!  We told the guy who delivered the food and he apologized and came back straight away with the water.  We start to eat and OF COURSE, mid-bite is when the server comes over, apologizes for forgetting our water and tells us that she's \"new\" and made a mistake.  We're fine, I mean, it happens right?  But the thing is, this is the second time and honestly, if she had just said at the beginning that she was new, I felt like I would have been prepared for maybe getting things wrong and been more empathetic.  Anyway, I got a burger that was ok, but not great.  Husband got fish and chips and seemed to like the tartar sauce they served, and the kiddo got a mini-cheeseburger.    After we finished our meals, the server came back and asked if we wanted dessert (we declined) and we paid the bill.  There wasn't anything spectacular enough for me to give this place a third try.  I did see the host walking around and another server who glanced over and saw we had no drinks, so I would think that even if the one server is new and struggling, the rest of the team might want to be more aware and help each other out.  The only saving grace is the guy who delivered the food, because he had a great personality and his apology seemed genuine and that's what I would expect out of the rest of the folks who were wandering around the place.  Too bad, Haymaker, I really wanted to make you a new place for us to go since you're so close by."}
{"text":"What a terrible experience from start to finish. Our group of 5 arrived at 1015 a.m. and being that it was a Sunday we expected a 20 minute wait or so. The hostess rudely took our name and said it would be 10-15 minutes, even with our need for a table as one of our group is in a wheelchair. Well almost an hour later and watching multiple groups of people who came in after us being we were shown to a completely empty portion of the restaurant. It then took one of us getting the manager for our server to come get our drink order. After our full order was taken our server stopped back one time to fill the coffee and poured coffee on our friend in the wheelchair and on the table on front of him; the server walked away without even acknowledging what he did. So 30 minutes after ordering our food came and it was just the icing on the cake. It was lukewarm and flavorless. The Dutch Apple French Toast was literally room temperature canned apple pie filling dumped on some white bread. The bacon and cheese omelet was way overcooked and had no cheese on it; also the potatoes it came with were flavorless and cold. The server finally reappeared and after asking 2x to speak to the manager he finally showed his face and was nothing but excuses; including telling our table we should come back but not on a Sunday or in the morning and that his staff is not well trained and this was all Groupons fault; we weren't using a Groupon. We will for sure not being going back ever; i had to go home after this 2.5 hour debacle and make my own breakfast."}
{"text":"Recently ate at Haymaker and enjoyed ourselves. Great service,  nice environment, delicious food! Only complaint was the mixed drinks,which lacked alcohol.We ordered long island iced teas and margaritas, they were not worth the slightly high price.  Other than that it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"I like the breakfast. Large tasty omelets, fluffy pancakes with a made from scratch taste.   And, for me, they have NHL Network on a tv here.  Other places we've been pretend to go talk to their managers and hope we forget when we ask for a tv on the same football game as 20 other tvs are tuned to get switched to a hockey game.   The wait staff here act as though they have a personal stake in us coming back. Sometimes customer service is the difference between one place Ann another down the road."}
{"text":"While the fried zucchini was delicious the chicken wings were overdone!!  It felt like I was eating jerky!!"}
{"text":"Could not get into the Black Bear diner so we started looking around for a place to have breakfast before we started a trip.  Came across this place and it was not crowded, although the food is good enough for it to be crowded.  Have the breakfast sandwich. It was great.   The country potatoes are not that could, so stick with the hash browns.   Nice spot.  Will come again."}
{"text":"The whiskey bar here is pretty impressive.  The bartender Jill made a couple of great recommendations based on brands that I already knew I enjoyed, plus she was enjoyable to chat with. The food is pretty good too! Another successful visit to the Haymaker, and I'll up my rating because of the whiskey choices!"}
{"text":"This place is close to home, great food, great prices, and cold jars of beer. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Came here for a Friday lunch for a friends birthday. The girl who served our table was very friendly! I ordered the raspberry lemoneddie and couldn't get enough! If it hadn't have been midday I could have enjoyed a few more. Not the sweetest drink, which I typically try and stay away from. It was fun to drink our beverages out of mason jars! Didn't imagine the place to be so southern but it hit me pretty quickly as I walked in!!! I ordered a BBQ chicken salad and was impressed! Bbqed chicken, ranch, BBQ sauce, lettuce and fried onions mixed in! Our server was so nice to take pictures for us and also brought out the cake we surprised our friend with. She didn't once complain about having to bring extra plates or new forks to us. I appreciated her positive attitude, also!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and nice variety! The staff is always friendly and the wait is average. This place has amazing breakfast served everyday!!!"}
{"text":"The Haymaker has a Claim Jumper feel with reasonable portion sizes. The Baked Mac-N-Cheese alone will make you slap somebody and go ahead and pencil in a return trip to this place in your calendar.   The Arizona Burger with a side of \"Frings\" : Onion Rings and French Fries mixed together for those of us who don't want to choose between our two most favorite side dishes... Was a great choice for my husband.   My daughter and I shared the teriyaki tenderloin. Very good. Very tender!!!  The great thing about the menu at this restaurant...there are no surprises. They list all of the ingredients on each item. If the burger doesn't show a tomato, you don't have to specify, \"no tomato.\" How novel.  Our party was too full to try the bread pudding. Not one person in our party of 8 had a bad food experience. We will have to come back to have dessert. All dessert menu items are $4. Good portions too.   They have a full bar with a huge lineup of beer on tap. 103 types of whiskey to try. My favorite is they have coke products!!!! Yay for me!"}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here twice during our stay in Peoria. The first time they were very busy and the server never offered hubs a second cup of coffee. The second time there the service was much better. Hubs tried the Pigs in a Blanket. They were huge and really good. Comfortable place, good menu selection, acceptable food, and TVs all around the room, if that's your thing."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!  Our service was great.   Or food was delicious!!!  The owner even came around & asked how it was.  Or second time here & I can't wait to come back again!  Yum!!!!!"}
{"text":"Only getting two stars because location is good.   The service was less than par. The waitress, while she seemed nice, took forever to check in on us and wait on us.   I got the chili chicken nachos I got was an odd combo. A glob of chili in the middle of chips and it was cold!!   The environment is okay. Country rock was playing and lots of old timers in the restaurant. Not a trendy place."}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant before the update they did. It used to be more like a family style restaurant, now it's a bar! We were the only people there but yet our waitress never once refilled our drinks. She acted like she was too good to even serve us? It's not a family restaurant anymore. They cut there menu in half. I hate it. I'll never be back."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about my experience at the Haymaker. The \"piggy platter\" was amazing. The meat just fell off of the bone on the ribs. excellent flavor. amazing service."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my breakfast at the Haymaker. Hubby and I shared the Huevos Benedictos and it was spicy and really good. Service wasn't bad either and the best thing is that there was no wait on a Saturday morning. We will probably be back."}
{"text":"PRO TIP: ORDER THE HAYMAKER! DO NOT MISS OUT  This is amazing! It's fried chicken on a bed of mashed potatoes topped with tomatoes, scrambled eggs and the most delicious chipotle sauce in top. It has the perfect combination of spice, flavor, crunchy and smooth texture all in one. The portion was huge but it was so hard to stop eating it.   If you have a sweet tooth and you are feeling a little boozy they offer adult shakes. I have not had these yet, but I will definetly be coming back for one.   The service was great and the ambiance was nice. Very american.   Recommend!"}
{"text":"We've tried this place on several occasions. Breakfast used to be pretty good. Then we tried dinner. Huge mistake. The food and service were horrible. The owners tried to make it right and gave us a gift certificate to come back and give them another try. I admit, when we came back it was really good...both the food and service. When we paid, the gift certificate must have been coded in a way that the manager knew we were there as a \"redo\". He came over to our table, thanked us for giving them another try asked about the foid and service, etc. He was very friendly and we left happy. I decided to go back today for breakfast. Well, back to the same. Service was fine, but the food wasn't. I ordered the eggs benedict. The hash browns were super greasy and you needed an electric chain saw to cut through the english muffin. There was no way a regular steak knife was gonna cut it. I struggled through but finally gave up. The manager stopped by and asked how everything was. I told her they needed to check their muffins and even showed her no sawing away was gonna cut it. She said nothing and walked away. She even looked right at me when we were leaving and didn't say a word, no apologies or even a \"have a nice day\".  It wasn't until we got to the car that my husband informed me his Belgium waffles were burnt. (He didn't want to say anything because it was my bday weekend,  and I picked to eat here). I'm giving it 2 stars instead 1 because we have had good food a few time. But we won't be back. $30 for breakfast and way too inconsistent."}
{"text":"We went for a late lunch/ early dinner and were seated in the bar area. It was not very busy but service was lacking. We had fried pickles for an appetizer which were good. The main dishes we received were just ok.My husband had ribs that looked greasy. The mashed potatoes were disgusting. My burger was fine but fries were tasteless. All in all it was just ok. We probably won't return."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, every thing ive had is delish! Love the bloody Mary's the fried zucchini is honestly the best I've ever had anywhere. Ever. The food is fantastic and the bartender Mike is also friendly and hilarious. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"First off.. Our server was PHENOMENAL! ! When you come in, definitely ask for Glen!! We came in as a large group. We were tended to promptly,  and the food was amazimg!! I had the French dip, everyone else had the pulled pork bbq sandwich.  We will definitely be back!  Friendly atmosphere,  good food, and great service! !"}
{"text":"Ah this place stunk! The waitress was so lackadaisical it wasn't funny. Then we FINALLY got our food and the orders were a little screwy and only one person out of our seven person party could actually eat their dinner. The salad had hardly anything in it and was wilted. The chicken was over peppered. Fries were nasty. Etc etc. Went to chick fil et for dinner right after and it tasted gourmet compared."}
{"text":"First time here and the food is great!  Janine our server was AWESOME!!  I WILL BE BACK"}
{"text":"We have been coming here on and off since they opened. This will be the last time we eat here, seems everything has got worse..the food, service and definitely not clean anymore. When places start to cut corners in food and staff then you know it's time to throw in the towel...It's not even mediocre..."}
{"text":"Not so hot. We waited an hour for our meal. The waitress kept telling us that they were backed up in the kitchen. She did apologize and comped us a dessert. They haven't been open too long and they need to get the kinks out. Hopefully they will."}
{"text":"The owner actually came to our table and talked about the food and the locally owned business. Very nice people."}
{"text":"After writing the original review, the manager contacted me and we discussed some of the issues I encountered.  Since he took the time to do that, I decided it was only fair to give them another chance.    Second trip: Our second trip was nothing like the first.  We walked in the door and were promptly greeted by the hostess.  The server was prompt in taking our drink & food orders and the food was served quickly.  Everybody at the table was happy with the quality of the food and we decided it's worth coming back again.     Original review: Sadly our visit started with waiting a few minutes for the hostess to come up while the rest of the staff walked past us like we were invisible.  After being seated, the same pattern happened with the wait staff and no one came to take a drink order. Had it been busy in there, I'd understand but there was only a hand full of tables and 4 or 5 servers. After 10 minutes of waiting, we got up and left."}
{"text":"All of the food we ordered was very good - the Texan burger, the bacon lettuce and tomato, the pork chop dinner as well as 2 appetizers and drinks. Portions were very generous on drinks and food! Several items we wanted to order we unavailable so the manager gave us 2 free deserts. Will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"This is a fabulous little spot in our new neighborhood and we love stopping in here! We came in after our final walkthrough on our house and I fell in love!   We have never been there when it is exceptionally busy so we have always been greeted and seated at a table immediately. The decor on the inside is really homey and makes you feel very welcome.  I will say, both trips we have made here I have ordered the same thing so I can't give a good review for different meals but what I have tried, I absolutely love. I normally order the biscuits gravy which for me, is hard to find a good restaurant that does it right. Haymaker definitely does it right! If you are a fan of this dish, I highly recommend!   I also normally always get the bacon Bloody Mary. Can't go wrong with this bloody because the bacon is always a nice touch!  They have a large menu so there is no shortage of finding a dish that suits you and the alcohol menu is excellent providing you with many options. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. They have a good sized menu and a huge Gluten Free menu, which is hard to find when you have an allergy. The restaurant is clean and the staff were friendly. The decor is very patriotic and tastefully done. Portion sizes are above average, but left me wanting to clean the plate.  Meatloaf was amazing with well seasoned mashed potatoes.  Cod and chips was good. Cardiologist burger (GF) and fries was amazing, the best part was a real GF bun. Not the usual store bought product.  Country fried chicken with a cream sauce was delicious, fried well with mixed veggies in the sauce.  This place was worth a breakfast stop as well.  GF Eggs Benedict with hash browns was good from the bun all the way up the the house made hollandaise and perfectly poached eggs.  Western Benedict had fresh perfectly ripe avocados for tomato. The eggs were poached perfectly. Country potatoes had a nice crispy side and were soft all the way through and had no starchy flavor. Sautéed with peppers and onions.  We will visit this place again if we are ever back in the area. Fantastic job to the staff."}
{"text":"This place has gotten better than before. The breakfast is one of the best around! They have really great coffee. You can't go wrong with any of their breakfast items;especially the morning glory muffin! For dinner or lunch I love their pulled pork sandwich."}
{"text":"First off I should have read the past yelp reviews before going here. Second off, DON'T believe the positive reviews as they must be the owners, staff or friends of the place as there is no way anyone would EVER give this 4 or 5 stars...  Went with a party of 4 and had to wait over 20 minutes for a waitress to even come to our table and the place had only 10 other people in it for the 3 waitresses to wait on. Took another 15 minutes to even get water then another 15 minutes for drinks. 3 out of 4's orders were wrong and had to be sent back. Burgers on 2 of the orders were well over cooked and they were ordered med-rare and they were well-done. Fries are store brought and horrible. Other person's order had raw chicken and in any place is unforgivable. When the orders were finally brought back after another 20 minutes the chicken was again cooked raw to the point of bloody.  Service is pathetic and when we asked 3 times for the manager he never came so we got up and left. We ourselves took off the 3 bad dishes and left no tip for the horrible service.  Will never go back an everyone should avoid this poor excuse of a place."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here at least once a week and every time has been great customer service and food is great, especially since my wife has a gluten allergy."}
{"text":"My family and i went to dinner here a few days ago. Excellent food, and our server (Tiffany) was very nice, and helpful. She did a excelling job, going above and beyond to meet our needs. We had a very good dining experience and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Tyler Miller helped us out a few years ago as a server and most recently on our visit he was behind the bar/server as we ate at the counter. What a great personality and fun to talk to...made for a very memorable evening. Can't wait to visit with you again Tyler you went above and beyond to make it a beautiful evening"}
{"text":"Huevous Rancharoes biscuits and gravy a breakfast burritos and omelette all wonderfull friendly staff great service"}
{"text":"This area needs a good restaurant, but unfortunately The Haymaker can't get their act together enough to deliver.   This is the second time that we have been to this location (Bell and Tatum) and both times the service has been sub-par.  However today, we waited for over an hour for our food. When it came, it was wrong and truthfully fine, but not worth the wait.  Mind you about 1/2 hour into the wait, our server told us that our food would be out \"in just a minute\". It was not.  When our food arrived, I asked for a manager who promptly came over. To his credit, he was very apologetic and offered to fix the wrong order and took care of 2 of the 3 entrees.  Btw the picture is of the side of fruit that comes with the meal. The butter and jelly packet are for size reference. If you are counting, that's 2 pieces of pineapple, a piece of melon and a wilted grape. Sad face.   Their supplier also did not deliver any potatoes so they were out of the potatoes O'Brien.  So maybe they were grossly underprepared for breakfast customers, but it also seems there is a training issue. Our server could have handled the situation better by being on top of everything. When we told her that We had been waiting for our food for 45 minutes (at that time) instead of telling us that a lot of people were seated at once, she could have been more proactive.   We probably won't be back. We didn't walk out though so 2 stars."}
{"text":"The Haymaker is awesome!  Service was great, breakfast was delicious and the Bloody Marys hit the spot.  Add in great prices and portions and you have a must visit destination."}
{"text":"Pretty good but pretty pricey. Chicken fried steak was cut with a fork tender."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this restaurant last Saturday night. We got a deal on Amazon Local and decided to give it a try. We've been here several times (one for each restaurant they've opened here). They have a restaurant area and a bar area.  They have tons of different types of whiskeys and beers. I ordered a BLT sandwich with french fries, my husband ordered fish and chips and we got a kid's menu for our daughter. The food was yummy but the place was pretty empty, which isn't a good sign. For some reason, every restaurant that opens on this location doesn't do well and we don't understand why. The location's great next to the freeway, within walking distance from a couple of hotels in the area and the food's good. Our waiter, Ramiro, was nice and attentive. He took care of us. The entire staff seemed nice, actually so no complains about this.  Honestly, we feel there are way too many restaurants like this on the same area (it's all \"American food\" kind of thing) and there's an Applebees, Chili's and other options withing a few miles so maybe the competition's killing this restaurant?  Anyway, the place is beautiful inside and the food was good. Prices were reasonable and portions are big. We also had the bread pudding and that was TO DIE FOR.   All in all, I'm not sure we'll go back (although it's kid friendly and they gave my daughter some crayons and a Princess theme coloring page) it's hard for us to go to a place like this with her because she can't sit still so we usually take food to go and eat at home but if you don't have this issue, give it a try, you may be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Came here for early dinner during happy hour with the family.  Great happy hour specials!  Our server R.J. was awesome! Highly recommend his section.  All of our meals tasted great and came exactly as ordered.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for good food & good service... skip The Haymaker.  Very very slow service, rude wait staff, and management unwilling to attend to customer concerns.  At least 3 other nearby restaurants you should try before haymaker."}
{"text":"They improved their dinner plates and earned another star from us! Delicious :)"}
{"text":"Great food but the service was horrible!  Me and my mother in law sat at the bar and we at first ordered water to decide what we wanted. The bartender never came back and was literally ignoring us. The only reason she came back to us was because the older couple next to us told her, \"I think they would like to order\". Her response was total irritation and then she said \"oh you want something else besides water\". Not sure what her issue was but I used to be a bartender and she was absolutely horrible towards us and all the other guest noticed it. I hope management reads this and has a talk with there staff. This was on 3/31/18 at 4pm. If you do go to this restaurant do yourself a favor and get seated at a table."}
{"text":"My family really enjoys this place, but you have to know what to order. - There rhythm hot chicken wings are amazing and give zipps chicken wings a run for their money. - Their fried pickles are amazing and you will not find any better ones in Phoenix.   - They have a great draft beer menu with lots of local craft beers - they have one of the most extensive whiskey menus in the valley.  - the only con I might have is they're now very consistent quiet yet, but they're still young."}
{"text":"Ever time I've been here it's been Great!! Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. Prices are reasonable and quality is superb!!! The ribs fall off the bone and are very delicious!! The fish-n-chips were awesome, not dripping with grease. Lol  Atmosphere is super comfortable a little country, a little classic rock. Patio at night is so relaxing. Staff is GREAT!!! Parker is on top of things and is very friendly, not to mention adorable!! Many Thanks for your service  I appreciate you. Pssst .... Still waiting on the bottle caps (deep fried jalapeño rings) when are they gonna be on the menu??  Lol ... Thx for making them for me several months ago. Love this place."}
{"text":"I have celiac disease and this is the one place I can get a completely safe and tasty meal. I have had breakfast, lunch and dinner and not only is the food very good, the kitchen totally gets how to make a safe gluten free meal, free from cross contamination. Love the friendliness of the manager and the employees."}
{"text":"Haymakers has a great combination of food, beer and whisky that is tough to beat at a nice local place. Friendly service too.  They also have a great Gluten Free menu, which is not always easy to find."}
{"text":"Just went for the first time for Father's Day.  Though there was a long wait, we ended up getting in quicker than they stated.  Waitress was not very attentive, however, it was busy.  Food was pretty good.  Omelets were mediocre.  Fried pickles were NOT frozen & really good.  Decor was very cute & they had quite of TV's in the bar area."}
{"text":"Hubby and I love going out for breakfast and since this was new to our neighborhood we decided to give it a try. The place has nice decor and the waiter was decent. What we didn't like is where the owners cut corners.  The home fry potatoes were obviously previously frozen from a bag because they were perfectly cubed, tasted bad and had a spoon full of peppers and onions randomly placed on top. I ordered a fruit side with my meal and again, was previously frozen. I understand cost and time  savings measures but this took away the quality of the meal and sorry to say, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood bar.  Good beer and bourbon selection.  Good classic food - nothing too fancy.  Good western vibe inside.  We love sitting at the bar and chatting with the bartenders."}
{"text":"A half pound beef burger cooked to bloody perfection, a half pound of hot pastrami, a slice of cheddar (I don't do swiss) on a pretzel roll with a side of crispy topped mac and cheese. The name of this gastronomic delight? The Cardiologist. Definitely on my list of top five burgers ever."}
{"text":"The food was really great and cooked really well. The service was decent; our waitress forgot to bring my boyfriend another drink but when she realized it she became more attentive afterwards, so that was fine. The dinner appetizer menu was limited pretty much to fried foods and sliders, not a lot of variety. It was SUPER overpriced for what you get, but I get that it's in the Phoenix metropolitan area, so whatever. And the atmosphere was very much a dive bar (cracked seats, smell of fried food) - I don't mind dive bars, I just gathered from their website that they were a little bit classier.  Long story short, I'll go back - but only during happy hour, and I'll definitely  dress down."}
{"text":"This is our 2nd trip to The Haymaker since they opened this location. I've had burgers both times and have been very happy both times. My wife had the teriyaki steak bowl the first time and a burger the second time. She said both were very good. They have several specials through the week and they appear to be winners. The place is packed tonight. The atmosphere is a mix between sit down and sports bar. There are ample TV's for you to watch a game. The wait staff and hostess are very pleasant and helpful. This a place you should try. I'm sure we will be back to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"The Haymaker takes traditional American comfort food and hits it on the head. Decorated in rural american flair, it offers a nice place for happy hour while the restaurant is welcoming to children. A vast selection of top shelf whiskeys pepper the back of the bar while a varried and delicious assortment of craft beer lines the taps. This is not a place trying to \"deconstruct a corn dog\". Its just an old fashioned American bar and restaurant. It's welcome addition to North Phoenix."}
{"text":"Went to haymakers a few times last year and had horrible experiences. Decided to give them a try again hoping things had changed. I was wrong... we went on a Thursday night for burger night. Burgers were ok, serves was not the greatest. She spilt a whole glass of water on my mother in law and never once said sorry. The bathroom needed attention badly so I had said something to the hostess, they never did anything about it. It was Disgusting! We won't be back again."}
{"text":"I'd hoped to try Haymaker for the first time this morning for brunch...  guess what?  NO BRUNCH and that's probably a good thing!  Walking in the door my guest and I were met with an overwhelming stench...  couldn't tell if it was sewage, a dirty grease trap or what.    So, I'm grateful that they won't serve the breakfast menu at 10:30 in the morning because there's something very WRONG with this place to admit guests when there's something very FOUL in the air!  I WILL NOT RETURN TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT!"}
{"text":"Good food, barely acceptable service. A little over priced. I don't mind  the $ but in return I tend to expect food and service to to be on par with the cost."}
{"text":"The food was good. I had the country fried steak and eggs. It came with a huge home-made biscuit which was okay. Our waiter was rude. He had no manners and was extremely inpatient while taking our order. My husband was ready to back-hand him."}
{"text":"On our first visit to this restaurant, we had brought our whole family. Loved the atmosphere! Food was just alright. Very stale, dry chicken. Soup is definitely from a can! 2nd visit was for breakfast...the biscuit was the driest biscuit I've ever had. It was almost laughable! Terrible customer service. Owner was very annoyed when my husband told him we didn't want the biscuit lol. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good quality and selection here! The owner needs to watch the ratio of servers and prime time dinner period. Did have one bad experience when it took over 40 mins to receive our meal. The salad @ $12 should have greens though..not iceberg lettuce!  Sandwiches and fries are very tasty."}
{"text":"First visit for breakfast on 10/18/14. Traditional breakfast items, eggs, omelets, French toast, pancakes and waffles. I had the American omelet (bacon, avocado, tomato and cheese. Served with Hash Browns and toast. Everything was excellent. Fresh, hot, and the potatoes were very crisp and nice and brown (my favorite way) Service quick and friendly. Other family members truly enjoyed their selections too! The biscuits are HUGE!, but still bakery quality.  Returned for breakfast this morning. 10/23/14. I ordered basic eggs, sausage, hash browns and toast. Today was a duplicate of the success of my first visit. I asked server to let me see their lunch/dinner menu. I looked it over and saw many items that peaked my interest. So... We returned tonight for dinner. My wife and I ordered The BLAT. A unique BLT with a fried tomato slice and avocado. Delish! Also, we got their chicken and biscuit, a creamy mix of shredded chicken, peas and carrots over a big biscuit. We loved it! It so reminded me of Chicken ala King, a favorite from my childhood. We also ordered the Fish and Chips. Beer battered, white, tender fish that was moist and the coating was crispy. Also delish Server tonight was great.  Fast and friendly.  She talked up the greatness of the house chili, so I decided to try just a cup. Great flavor, spicy, but not so much that the taste disappears. We are looking forward to visiting them again and trying other items. The owner/manger, who introduced himself at our table tonight when he stopped by to check on our visit, should be commended on trying to give the west valley a restaurant that provides great American culinary fare with good service."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for gluten free food and great beer/cocktails. We have had breakfast lunch and dinner at Haymaker and they deliver great food an service every time."}
{"text":"We wouldn't go out of our way to come back to this restaurant again..food is mediocre. Seating is uncomfortable with tables crowded too close together.. perhaps someday mgmt will clean up the restaurant."}
{"text":"I love the location, staff and atmosphere. My eggs Benedict were great, the potatoes were horrible. They were uncooked. My son enjoyed his pancakes. I will go again, but avoid the undercooked potatoes."}
{"text":"They have an excellent green chili cheese burger , and o-rings also very good, would definitely be back by the way the breakfast we had a couple of weeks ago was also very good and well worth it , good job guys , see you soon"}
{"text":"We visited AZ this weekend and we chose to eat here for breakfast. It was very good. I had the eggs benedict which was delicious. Only thing I would say is that it needed a little bit of salt. Service was great. If we are out there again I would definitely go back. We sat outside on the patio so I didn't really see much of the inside but it was nice."}
{"text":"My wife and I went during a busy time and food was done perfect.  The main reason for the review is for the 5 star service we received from our server Sean.  He was very pleasant and professional with a positive attitude.  We have ate here a few times and service was a little spotty at times.  When we go back we will be requesting him again!!!  Thanks Haymaker as Sean is an asset to the company!!"}
{"text":"Great family restaurant, but in the latter part of the evening this is a great sport bar too. Nice large televisions over the bar with Sal as your bartender is tough to beat. Excellent selection of whiskey and draft beers served by an incredibly knowledgable bartender, good food and excellent surroundings, hard to find a better place than this. Pet friendly outdoor patio. One of the better places in the area, must try for sure.  They recently turned this location into a sports bar, and I see all the negative yelp reviews, but I was in there last night and I thought it was great. The menu has most of the great items on it you would want in a sports bar, and everybody seemed to be enjoying their food. This will be a good place for football. The service was outstanding, and the place was packed. I think they needed to make the change here. I will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Food not great, took forever to get food then it came out cold. Service is below average and then the waitress messed up on our tabs and it took over 30 mins to get it sorted out. Not a place to right home about!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of our favorite breakfast places on the weekend. We usually sit in the bar area and receive outstanding service from Kathy. She is very friendly and always make sure we have everything we need and that our food is just the way we want it. You can't go wrong with the Eggs Benedict, breakfast burrito or California omelet.   I'm happy to support this local business versus the same old chain restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"The food was edible and could have been a lot better. Typical bowling alley French fries and a bland dry tasteless \"cardiologist\" burger. Has potential but there is nothing special. My main gripe with this place is the beer situation. Anytime I go somewhere and they actually have good craft beer in excited. This place has good beer. But no one there knows anything about it. There is no rotating tap list so you have to be in the bar or walk over there to see what's on tap, the server had no idea. Also you can't serve every beer in a mason jar.  I get that it goes with the theme but it's dumb."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Cibola Vista Resort and came here for almost every meal.  Great place, great food. Very reasonable. And the service was good. They also give a discount for guests staying at the resort.  Great breakfast as well!"}
{"text":"When your server says it's going to be a long wait because the kitchen is way behind, that for one made me not want to wait. Then I asked if we could order an appetizer and have that and he said it wouldn't come out quick. I'll never come back here."}
{"text":"Been here a number of times and enjoy coming back each time.   For a weekend lunch, my favorite is a Texan burger with a Templeton's rye and a Firestone IPA (followed by a nap).  I also enjoy sitting at the bar here. Sitting at the bar, there is a feeling of community and the bartenders and managers will talk whiskeys and are pleasant all around.   They keep a good balance of community bar on one side of the place and family-frendly restaurant on the other side. The serving staff each seem to know the menu and make good recommendations when we bring company here."}
{"text":"Really delicious. Good tasted great and service was great as well. Decor is also really cute. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner on Wednesday night, the food was great. We ordered the Texan and Rustler burgers and they were both phenomenal and filling. To round out our night, we had the best server! Nicki was very attentive and super friendly, thanks Nicki we will be back!!]"}
{"text":"Shane made this coolest place ever even cooler. The Achocolypse is delicious. If you stop in make sure you tell them Daniel sent you, they have no idea who I am so it will mean nothing but know that I will appreciate you."}
{"text":"Pretty decent plCe.   Great burgers.   Great ribs!  Even better BBQ sauce.     Sticky tables though.    Service was great!"}
{"text":"So somehow I forgot to review my first time here. I decided based on 2 visits I would not come back for dinner.  I waited 3 minutes for a server because the hostess obviously did not tell him he had a table. You could tell by the fact that he walked around the corner and looked suprised.    Cons:  The menu they gave me was kinda greasy.  Their ice tea was so bitter. I could not drink it. It tasted like it was brewed in a coffee maker.  I remember from my last visit that they are a little over priced on their liquor if you want a martini. It was 2 dollars higher than their competition.   Pros: My server was very nice. He was friendly and attentive as was my server before.  Food combining both visits was a 3 out of 5. I think this should be a breakfast place because both times I have been here the food is just ok. I feel like the food is on part with Applebee's etc. Both visits most of the patrons are families with kids."}
{"text":"Service was great. Food is Good. Cool decor, polite and prompt staff. Can hang out for happy hour here. Never been in late. BBQ sauce is good!"}
{"text":"They no longer offer breakfast except on weekends (brunch) but the food is still stellar for lunch and dinner.  I enjoy the BBQ offerings most of all. Also, the updated look and theme to a sports grill is much better."}
{"text":"I came to have breakfast with my Bro and sis. It was my first time here. We were seated promptly and given coffee within 5 minutes. The coffee was pretty good. I ordered the AZ omelette with country hash browns and a biscuit. Also the apple cinnamon French toast. My meal was pretty delicious. My only complaint was that they forgot my biscuit. :-( Hmmm. Should I take a star because they forgot my biscuit? Nah. The potatoes were REALLY good. And Alvin, our server, was on top of getting our coffee refilled and tending to our needs.   I would definitely come back and try their lunch  or dinner menu. The one complaint I keep reading here is the service. I can see why since when they get busier, the service quality does drop. But I would come back because the food was tasty. Thanks Alvin for the great service."}
{"text":"Wow first time here and I am impressed!  Loved the service and the BBQ pulled pork. Yumm"}
{"text":"After reading excellent reviews we decided to dine here while staying in Peoria. Service was excellent. I ordered ribs and fries, and they were very good. My wife had the BBQ chicken and it was just ok-too stringy for her, but the Mac and cheese were very good. She also had the apple cisp and it was very good.  At first we were taken aback by the God and country jargon on the wall, but then we noticed the racist shirts many of the servers were wearing. We were very offended!   We won't be back!  Too white- trash for us."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very reasonably-priced and the quality is excellent. They are military and dog friendly and have a great business ethic. The customer service was also above average!"}
{"text":"Just left haymakers new spot in Goodyear. The food was excellent ! I had the grilled cheese with three different cheeses with bacon and my wife had the teriyaki bowl. We shared the wings as an appetizer. All the food was very well done and very tasty! Super good French fries with my sandwich.   Our server Chad is probably new and I'm willing to give him a bit of a break.   However, Many things that are basic to good service was missing. No lime in a vodka tonic. No plates for the wings so we could put our discarded bones on. I had to go up to the bar for a piece of lime and we had to ask someone beside our server for a plate for the bones. No ketchup at the table for the fries. We had to ask. Missing the attention to details.   We arrived just before 7pm and I asked our server if we could still get happy hour (which ends at 7 and he said we just made it. When our bill arrived there were no happy hour discounts. That was disappointing.   Also, Our server did not thank us for coming in. I'm hoping chad will get better training and will be there on our next visit. We will visit again."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday to watch the afternoon games and we sat in the dinning room. Our server seemed upset we asked for a certain game to be played on one of the tvs. After ordering food and being there for 3 hours some of our party left. The server never came back for the last hour to ask us if we needed anything. We asked the manager and he said that a guy should have taken over but our previous server never mentioned anything to us about her shift being over. Our server came over and said that she thought we would waive her down if we needed anything. The manager Ryan came over and said he would discount our bill 20 percent but when the bill came he didn't. We confronted him about it and he said he did but we looked over the bill several times and there wasn't any discounts. I still tipped 20% because I can't tip less, but I didn't appreciate the managers offer and not following through. He said I'm sorry for the terrible service and he would discount the bill 20 % but he said it in a sarcastic manner. We used to come here when it was native New Yorker but this experience has rubbed me the wrong way and I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Good food. Big Blue Van beer has a great blueberry flavor. The Texan and Patty melt are delicious."}
{"text":"We have been to Haymaker a few times now, once for dinner and a few times for breakfast. I prefer their breakfast over dinner.  We went on a Thursday night for their burger special. My husband thought his burger was tasty. I had the veggie burger and I was underwhelmed. I thought the fries were just average.  We both have never been disappointed in the breakfast. I had their Florentine Benedict every time and I think it is very tasty. I love the hollandaise sauce and the English muffin. Their breakfast potatoes aren't the greatest. Definitely tastes like they were frozen and they have come out undercooked. Not bad, but not good.  Service has always been great. Friendly and attentive. We will be back again and again for breakfast and to try their happy hour."}
{"text":"Reviews had me fooled.  Went there for lunch with my son.  The atmosphere was bland and the food was not much more than bland."}
{"text":"Had a good dinner here and decided to return for lunch the next day.  Dinner didn't have a single issue. Ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich, wife had a French Dip--both were big, seasoned well with quality ingredients. Server was fine, no issues whatsoever.  Returned for lunch ~2:30pm. Server \ bartender (New England accent?) got my order wrong and was insistent that I said it wrong ( I didn't). No refills, no checkups despite having 2-3 other servers working.  The food that I got (albeit incorrect) was very delicious and fairly priced. I really want this place to make it, but I think that their servers need training or to be replaced.  EDIT: I appreciate that the owner reached out. Much respect and that goes a long way in my book."}
{"text":"Portions have gone down lots ordered pig wings only 3 and a little side portion for 15.00 not worth it."}
{"text":"Good happy hour drink prices. Limited appetizers on menu. The beef sliders and sweet potato fries were very good. Nice decor and bar area. Great to have another non-chain bar/restaurant in area. Thank you for great time and service Jen (bartender)."}
{"text":"The cowboy platter made me sick afterwards and the waiter didn't seem polite, but was rather odd. Made me thought he did something to our food"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now with my daughter and she loves it! The food is yummo-great burgers and they have a really good happy hour too! Their dessert menu is fabulous too! And dont forget to grab the root beer barrel candies on the way out!"}
{"text":"Went here with another couple and the whole experience was disappointing, especially with the great experience I had at the Peoria location the day prior. We called ahead for a table, when we got there we were told \"just one minute\", that person then sat a different group and then never came back. A male who appeared to be a manager then said again \"it will be just a moment\" they then proceeded to seat three other parties, one of which I knew had arrived after us. I inquired and he said we had a large party (I guess 5 people is large).   Anyway, we got seated and then it got worse, we were given paper wrapped silverware when all the other tables had cloth, we asked the server about happy hour and it took her several minutes to find just one menu and 5 of us were trying to share the menu. We asked a question about what one of the appetizers contained and she had no clue, we then ordered drinks and an appetizer. She did not understand what a jack and Coke tall was and we had to explain.  We received our wings prior to getting our drinks, it took 16 minutes for us to get our drinks we ordered. When the wings were brought to the table no plates came with, we asked someone who appeared to be a bus boy for plates and he took several minutes and then brought us to-go boxes, then when we told him plates again he asked how many, rather than just bring enough for the table. She brought the jack and Coke and it was clear, when we told her that it wasn't jack and Coke as Coke is dark and not clear she proceeded to say well maybe they just didn't mix it very well.   We ordered salads and rather than those coming out before the meal as in most restaurants they brought out all the food together. The food was not great, a burger we ordered with a medium temperature came out well done and the rest of the food was nothing special.   Then the bill came, right when we sat down we had asked for two checks, however the bill wasn't split, so we asked again. The bill was incorrect and had charged us full price for drinks that were on happy hour, when I pointed this out it took several minutes for our sever to get it taken off.  This place seems extremely unorganized, inefficient and there staff does not seem trained. Like I said I had dined at the Peoria location yesterday and was raving about it to the other couple, this was a major let down and we will not be back, at least not to the Goodyear location."}
{"text":"First time here and it did not disappoint!! Hallie was our server and was amazing!! Such a relaxed Nd comfortable atmosphere....can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"Searching for a pre-theatre place, my wife found this on Yelp!, and the ratings and menu looked good.  A very casual, laid-back place, and when we entered we wondered if it was senior citizen's day! ( we qualified!)  We were seated at a booth in the bar, and the bartender came around and took our order.  Very attentive despite her busy bar duties.  We tried the local 4 Peaks pineapple brew, and while tasty once, probably won't order it again.  Then we chose the mini-ribbies for a starter, four pork ribs slathered in a delicious sauce and fall off the bone, served on a tasty bed of cole slaw.  My wife then sensibly ordered the buffalo chicken salad for her entree, while I went for the ranch hand sirloin, ordering it my usual way, Pittsburgh.  The bartender told me to hope for the best.  I also got smashed potatoes with my meal and substituted the cole slaw for the seasonal vegetables.  A different server brought my plate, and I sent it back because the seasonal vegetables were on it.  The slaw was not as good without the barbeque sauce dribbling on it ( take note, kitchen!)  Potatoes were tasty.  The steak was cooked properly (!) but was a little dry.  Guess I should have accepted the offer from the bartender for A-1 sauce!  Not a bad meal, and I would probably go again and try something different.  Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"My daughters and I came for lunch. I really liked the patriotic decor...very nice atmosphere. They have great lunch specials and their food is very tasty. We're here on vacation for a week and we plan to go back again before we leave."}
{"text":"Its hard to find good Wings, but this place pulled thru! Great Wings had 'em with the Pineapple Habanero for Appetizer, I ordered the Country Fried Chicken - it was delicious with a great Peppery Cream Sauce - & the Wife had the B.L.A.T. Sandwich - she loved it. Great Food, Great, Fast Service!!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast, friendly staff and great mimosas and bloody Mary's! Sometimes there is a wait but usually not too long..."}
{"text":"Breakfast, very poor service. :( Not a return place for us I cant understand all employees standing around while we had to ask for coffee, cream and water"}
{"text":"Went to Haymakers last week and it was great.  The chicken wings I had were so tasty and they have gluten-free beer.  Woot, Woot.  The waitress was so great.  There were a lot of people there for happy hour and the waitresses got everything right.  They were so attentive."}
{"text":"Service is always fantastic. On top of things without being pushy. I would give it 4.5 stars but I've been to the Goodyear location and that is the 5 star Haymaker! It's hard to compete with that one! Their bartenders are amazing!"}
{"text":"Mom and pop shop.  Awesome menu and service.  Order the fried pickles with ranch-trust us!  We are so excited that they have a breakfast menu and we can't wait to come back to test it out and have a mimosa.  It is kid friendly and their happy hour cannot be beat in this area.  We are not whiskey people but if you are, this will be your fave spot.  A must visit folks."}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers, pretty good not overly salty BBQ pulled pork sandwiches, and delicious regular and sweet potato fries are just a few of the reasons this place has joined my regular visit list.  Some other reasons I enjoy this place so much is a great happy hour, a whiskey as far as the eye can see, and an outgoing staff that shows pride in their establishment.  I did seem to notice the food on my last few visits to be a bit on the greasy side.  That is is the some reason I am giving The Haymaker 4 our of 5 stars.  Overall this is a place you go to if a good meal, at a reasonable cost in a comfortable relaxed atmosphere is what you desire."}
{"text":"We have been here twice. The first time was on a Sunday, so it was really busy. It took forever to be seated and when we were it was at the table by the kitchen being served by the bartender who was very busy at the bar and didn't have time for those not at the bar. The food was okay, the omelette was dry and the bacon was damn near burnt.  Anyway, fast forward about 8 months and we decided to give it another chance. Ugh...  It's Monday morning, the day before a holiday and we were seated immediately at a dirty table. The young lady who seated us complained about the busser not showing up and that she had to do everything. The waitress came to get our drink order and didn't return to the floor for 10 minutes. She proceeds to walk around with our drinks in her hand for a few minutes as she talks to other people. She finally comes to our table with our drinks and takes our order.  The food came out fast, and we quickly found out why. The omelette was dry and burnt around the edges. The hash browns were black around the edges and the soft bacon ordered was well done.   The waitress never came back to our table until we waved her down for the check.  There won't be a third visit."}
{"text":"Food is awesome.  Service is very slow.  Customer service is ok.  Seems like the employees are so stressed they are at each other's throat."}
{"text":"Decent bar food; slow service. Was there for Thursday lunch and we had the patty melt (good, but greasy) and a couple of burgers that needed a bit more sauce or something."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here with my family! Food took a little long to come to the table which is why I didn't give it 5 stars but other than that the service was fantastic. Georgia peach mason jar drink is so refreshing and not overpowering at all. I would highly recommend it.  I was a little unsure of the house made chili so our server brought me a sample it was delicious. The fries are so good and kids meals are just $5.00! Definetly a fun place, will be back to try breakfast!"}
{"text":"I would like to edit my review, the GM, a Mr. Ricci, has addressed my concerns sincerely, and in a amazingly quick manner.  He has also offered to rectify our experience with a refund and a card to come back.  This is unnecessary as just the addressing of the concerns is good enough for me.  I wish all management staff took the time to listen as he did.  I will definitely be giving them another go."}
{"text":"So, we tried the Haymaker again. & again I was disappointed.   My salad, described as \"mixed greens\" was actually iceberg with a couple of other greens thrown in. Such a bummer!  My sin's burger was obviously a frozen patty grilled, which is ok for a chain joint, but I expected more and better from the Haymaker.  Lastly.. I'm glad they advertise that the kids Mac and cheese is Kraft (appreciate the transparency there), but that, too, is a bummer.  Mylist of great NW Valley restaurants is very short... unfortunately the Haymaker isn't on it :(."}
{"text":"Just had the slider appetizers and they were delicious. Our server Stormi was SO GREAT and so nice. The table next to us complimented her that she's the best server they've ever had, so kiddos to her for being so great at her job. Will be back, nice place."}
{"text":"Decided to try breakfast here instead of the normal IHOP. I am pleased that I did! The food was great, pretty large portions for a normal price. Big pancakes and cheesy omelettes and the French toast was great! I've also been for happy hour and the appetizers are great.   The main reason I love this restaurant is because on Thanksgiving 2015 these people came in and worked to feed veterans for free! It was so special and meant so much to my family and I.  I say give it a try especially breakfast and happy hour!"}
{"text":"First time my girlfriend and I visited this restaurant. We were pleased to see happy hour everyday with great drink prices. However, we went there for both dinner and drinks.  We started off with the wings as an appetizer. We had bone - in medium flavor. They were excellent! By far, some of the best appetizer wings I have ever had.  For dinner, I had the Cowboy Cut Bone-in Strip. It was cooked a little more rare than I asked for. The steak tasted good, but nothing special about it. The baked potato as a side was excellent! It had excellent flavor. The side of vegetables were good as well.  My girlfriend had the blackened salmon which she said tasted great. Season and cooked well. The rice pilaf that came with was a great pair with the fish, as well as the vegetables.   Overall, we had a good experience eating there. I should have asked to get the steak cooked a little longer and I think I would have enjoyed it better. I will go back again for dinner and I would like to try their breakfast based on the other reviews I've read."}
{"text":"Good food, nice option here in Goodyear"}
{"text":"Very slow service at the bar. Felt like I was on an episode of Bar Rescue on stress test night... and it was a Tuesday."}
{"text":"Most of the reviews that are negative are service related. My experience was quit different. This was my first visit and I stopped in because I wanted something different than the usual breakfast avail in N Phx. I was immediately greeted and sat. My server was Albert. I know this because he told me his name! Amazing concept but most restaurants do not ask this of their waitstaff and it is the simplest of gestures which makes the guest feel comfortable and at ease.  Albert was quick, friendly and efficient. He even helped me order slightly off menu to be sure I got what I wanted.  The food was good, but a tip: the American waffle would be much better with fresh fruit. The purée made the waffle soggy.   This place is simple with a simple menu. Nothing fancy but it's good and the service was great. Deserves the stars."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in the area. Always crowded, but never a long wait. Great service! The only thing better than the service is the food. Top notch breakfast! Lunch and dinner is great too. Very accommodating for children of all ages, even my 8 month old daughter loves the food there"}
{"text":"Today was our 2nd time in for breakfast. I am really impressed with their chicken fried steak! It's one of the best around town. They have big portions and reasonable prices! This is a great breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Sitting here right now, still no food. Had bad service when restaurant wasn't busy. Staff up for all days, or buisness is going out of buisness!!"}
{"text":"My second visit and very happy!  We tried the Haymaker the first week.  Food was ok but we knew it was new and we wanted to try again.  The 2nd time the food was wonderful! Service was cheerful. Greeted by the manager and he genuinely made us feel thankful we returned.    I had the pulled pork and my husband a burger.  Both were great!  And dont forget to try the pomegranate margarita!   :)"}
{"text":"A week or so ago I had a great lunch here so I decided to take my friend there  early on a  Sunday morning for breakfast. We arrived about 7:30 greeted and seated quickly. Our server was right there to over beverages. My friend had the Bloody Mary and I had coffee. Both were great.  We both ordered from the senior menu- She had the California omelet with hash browns and a homemade biscuit. I ordered the ham and cheese with same to sides.    Our orders arrived promptly. Here are my comments: 1.California omelet was very good. Fresh and moist and very tasty per my friend. Salsa would have  been a nice touch. 2. The ham and cheese omelet was very dry and not very warm. 3. Hash browns were far from hot or even warm. 4. Biggest disappointment were the Homemade biscuits. They were cold and dry. No butter was offered and we asked for some but on a cold biscuit it did not help.   I ordered some of the wonderful bread pudding that I had last time to go.  I did not think I had to tell my server no Ice Cream for it was TO GO. An hour later when I got home I noticed something leaking out of the container. Well it was the Ice Cream and I did not see any of the sauce that comes with it. When I had it to go last time the sauce was in a nice little container and of course not Ice Cream.   Possibly it was a new server. Next time I will be clear on the Bread Pudding situation. I will go back again but just wanted to share my experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last night for our \"date night,\" and we have no regrets choosing The Haymaker! I got the BLAT sandwich, (which was delicious, by the way) and he got the ribs/chicken plate (I can't remember the name on the menu, but it was also VERY good!) His came with baked mac'n'cheese and mine with sweet potato fries. We were 100% satisfied with our food, and after ordering the bread pudding for dessert we were stuffed to the brim. It was great food for a great price, and we definitely plan on returning!"}
{"text":"I have been to the lake pleasant location about a half dozen times and always order the the southwest chicken salad; it's my favorite. I just happened to be on this side of town and decided to stop in with my family for my favorite salad. To say I was disappointed would be a understatement.  The blackened chicken which is typically spicy with a delicious crust, had hardly any seasoning, and at first thought they had  put the wrong chicken on the salad.  The lettuce was limp, and almost soggy and the dressing not as tangy as usual. My aunts ordered the chili and both their bowls were luke warm.  However, our server was really kind and patient considering   the size and the many questions my family asked. If this had been my first visit to a haymaker I would have just considered this a mediocre lunch restaurant."}
{"text":"I feel that two stars is very generous. The atmosphere is so bad.  No one in there. We ordered parmesan garlic wings, macaroni & Cheese, the B.L.A.T. sandwich and fries. The wings were some of the worst I've ever had! (Obviously the owners are not from New York! ) They tasted freezer burnt and not crispy as ordered. The macaroni & Cheese was okay and the B.L.A.T.  sandwich was good but dry. The best food that we ate were the fries. We will not be back. Nothing seems to last at this location. So hoping this was going to be the place."}
{"text":"Gluten Free Review... For starters when we walked in the restaurant smelled of raw sewage. Luckily we were seated in the back away from the bathrooms but it was later confirmed the smell was coming from the men's room. I am sure this was just one of those fluke things and just so happened to be on the night we were there so I am unsure if that should dissuade you from trying it...  When I was seated I asked for a gluten free menu and to speak with the manager. As usual I like to let the management know that I am a celiac and that I am very sensitive to gluten. Since this was our first visit I had a few questions about preparation, handling, and the menu. The manager (not sure of her name as she didn't give it) seemed a bit annoyed with my questions. At one point she told me that the heat from the flat top grill \"killed the gluten from other food\" so I didn't have to worry about cross contamination. I also questioned one of the gluten free menu items because it had soy sauce. I asked if it was Tamari or brewed (just to be certain) and I got an eye roll with the answer that everything on that gluten free menu was gluten free.  I got very uncomfortable at this point. I had read other reviews that the BBQ sauce was infract GF (and I was out with others) so I decided to go with ribs so nothing had to touch the flat top grill. My food did come on a red plate to designate that it was gluten free and I did not become ill from the food. The food itself wasn't that great the sauce was a bit bla and the ribs were underwhelming. The non GF eaters in the party were overall underwhelmed with there food as well. We are unsure if we will go back (still nervous about the preparations). If you are a celiac I would ask lots of questions about preparation before ordering though!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible experience. From the rude, inattentive waitress (Becky) to the bad food to the missing soup. Do not recommend. Will never return. I'm not even going to go into detail on how bad the food was. Just avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"Love this place!! The food is awesome and service is great. Close to the house, so I frequent this place.. Give them a try, I don't think you'll be disappointed"}
{"text":"Great Breakfast and reasonably priced.  Sad they won't be open for breakfast during the week!!"}
{"text":"Marginal to say the least!! Been to other Haymakers and was very satisfied. This on the other hand left me wanting for service and my food. This may be a new restaurant but when I opened restaurants, the employees didn't make false excuses for food not coming with the rest of the party. We admitted a mistake and tried to make my customer happy. Everyone was mostly through the meal when I received mine,when the waiter said \" It takes a long time to make these\". REALLY? Fish Tacos! Give me a break. I could have flown to Missouri, caught the Catfish and flown back while waiting. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! We had an Awesome breakfast and great service. We came in on Saturday morning and waited for a table for a few minutes tops. Their Ca omelet is Amazing!!! Can't wait to return with my Husband for more. I've heard they have happy hour on Sunday mornings too."}
{"text":"Immediately after being seated,  we had to use our napkin to dry a table that was obviously wiped with a super soaked item. The servers were friendly (one being trained). Dinner was good however cutting meat on waxed paper can be challenging. We were surprised that our bill was presented without being offered dessert first. Then after placing our dessert requests, and BEFORE receiving the 3 desserts, again our bill was given to us. Were we being given the bum's rush?"}
{"text":"Best Chicken Fried Steak ever.....perfect gravy!"}
{"text":"My husband,16 year  son and I came here the other night and enjoyed it.  I have never been to the old haymaker but I do have to say, we did enjoy our meal and a couple rounds of pool at the new haymaker.  Food was great and so was the service.  People need to embrace change.  Things can't stay the same forever.  Two thumbs up for me!  This place isn't super close but we will venture back again!"}
{"text":"My first time here was for brunch...and I loved it! The place is a bit too dark and gloomy for me, but everything else was great. I ordered the Biscuits, Gravy & Eggs. Biscuits and gravy is probably my favorite thing to eat for breakfast and they do it well! I also ordered it with scrambled eggs and hash browns. Everything was delicious and cooked perfectly.   Now, the best part are the mimosas. Some places charge you an arm and a leg for mimosas, so I was pleasantly surprised when the bill came and they were only $3!  I am excited to return again and try some other items on their menu...with a mimosa of course!"}
{"text":"Great deal on appetizers during Happy Hour.  We tried the pineapple habanero wings, the ribs , sliders and deep fried pickles #fatkid . We both loved the batter for the pickle spears although we were surprised to see spears vs. Chips.. no biggie. Hubby enjoyed the whiskey flight. The Coldcock whiskey was hands down my favorite, an herbal flavored whiskey. The ambiance was ok, seems to be one of those spots that the service is better when you become a \"regular\".  WE will defiinitely be back and perhaps we will become regulars."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here for the 1st time. It was pretty darn good! I got the huevos rancheros and my friend the french toast. We were afraid there was going to be a long wait since the parking lot was full and it being football Sunday.. Waited 10mins and prompt service. We even took advantage of the Sunday football special.. $4 craft beer all day."}
{"text":"This place was dead when I came with a large group (15) for happy hour and the service was slooooowwwww. We order drinks and a few appetizers, but we were surprised to find that many of their beers were not available. Apparently, they were installing a new walk-in cooler. So, I was served a beer in a can... no glass. The appetizers (fried pickles) finally came (and a frosty glass for my half gone beer) and I was bummed. They were pickle spears caked with a ton of fried batter. First, fried pickle spears are not very easy or convenient to share (which was my intention), so I ended up eating them all myself. Second, the copious amount of over-fried, hard batter tore my mouth up. I enjoy the fried pickle slices much more.  I didn't have dinner, so I will update my review when I return.  (PS Frosted mugs/glasses add unwanted moisture and degrade the beer.)"}
{"text":"The bartenders r incredible..the food is amazing.. It can be disheartening listening to Tammi the manager ridicule the employees.."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to come for breakfast. Their breakfast dishes are always SO good and always fresh! My favorite dish is the Cowboy Platter: 3 eggs cooked any way you like, choice of meat from bacon, sausage, or chorizo (highly recommend), choice of hashbrowns or country potatoes, and toast. It's a pretty hefty dish that satisfies.  Customer service is the one thing that this place is lacking. Previously, I've received excellent service, but the last 2 visits were not so great. The waitress on both occasions were non-engaging and very abrupt. On one of the visits, the waitress flat out ignored my boyfriend and I while she waited on the table RIGHT NEXT TO US and her attitude did a complete 180 any time she went between the 2 tables. We could obviously hear her ask the next table if there was anything she could get for them, going above and beyond, but the minute she turned to help us, she was unfriendly and acted as if taking our order or requests was such a chore. Forget asking for a coffee refill without her eyes rolling to the back of her head! If her attitude was the same across the board it would be no big deal, but she showed obvious disdain for us in particular.  In short, I love the food they serve. But their customer service skills from some of the staff is horrendous.  I recommend coming here as early as possible to get decent service and avoid a long wait to take your order."}
{"text":"My son and I go to Goodyear for his travel baseball team and play at the Red's Complex.  I know the Haymaker from Peoria and love it so I wanted to stop at Goodyear.  The food is very good and the staff is very friendly.   So much better than your typical chain.   This is also a great place to watch a sporting event."}
{"text":"Would give 0 stars, waitress was very rude I understood they were busy but yelling over the bar asking what I would like to order. 5 things down"}
{"text":"So they have a great beer selection and pretty good service but the food is really really bad. And I ordered things that are hard to mess up like chicken fried steak and fish and chips."}
{"text":"I have been to this place at least a dozen times and it's slowly circling the drain.  It seems this location is jinxed as no one seems to last long here.  Haymaker started out strong, but again it seems the management, the cooks and customer service just don't care much any more.  I feel sorry for the bartender who seems to work 80 hours a week as every time we have been there, he's there working hard.  He had to wait tables in the bar last night.  We went there after the Cardinals game and .. of course, the place was empty and all of our food was horrible.  I ordered the ribs and I don't believe they were really ribs.  The fish 'n chips were horrible.  The fish had about an inch of batter on them with a tiny bit of fish in the middle!!!  They also don't seem to get any new whiskey in.  And who in their right mind would sit in what we call the \"Chucky Cheese\" dining area.  It's cold and very uncomfortable.    I can't imagine they will be open much longer .. another one bites the dust at this location."}
{"text":"Best place in Peoria. Staff are very friendly, and the food is 110% delicious. If your in through mood for breakfast, try the Pork Hash. OMG. What a meal"}
{"text":"Have been here several times now and see no reason to keep from returning.  Great place to watch a game, drink a good beer, and enjoy any meal!  Have been here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Service has always been adequate."}
{"text":"Zero stars. Got seated, two servers walked past us and no one came by after about six minutes to even greet us and get our drinks. Weird. We got up and left ! Wonder if it's good food"}
{"text":"We went to Haymaker with another couple and had a great time.  The atmosphere is great, the service is great and food is really good.  As a matter of fact, I was so pleased with the experience that I asked the manager to come out so I could compliment her on the restaurant.  The bill came and we were surprised how inexpensive it is to eat there.  I highly recommend The Haymaker for Breakfast."}
{"text":"My family and I went to toss place for dinner.  We won't come back.  My son ordered the Texan burger which was great.  Thank god.  No one wants to eat a meal with an unhappy teenager haha, right? I ordered the ranch hand steak.  It wasn't that great.  My steak knife was so doll it was really ticking me off.  The veggies were not great at all.  Yuck. Not seasonal either.  Let's be honest.  My husband ordered the cardiologist burger.  He didn't eat it.  The side of mac and cheese he did not like either.   Our waiter was nice though and it was a nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant. Great location in a well developed shopping center. The decor of the restaurant flowed nicely. Good rustic theme. The service was good, kept the refills coming. Very friendly. We came for dinner at night and breakfast in the morning. Both meals were excellent. Perfect size portions too."}
{"text":"Great place. We decided to check them out since Cracker Barrel had a long wait for breakfast. You will not be disappointed here. I had the Haymarker Benedict and it was great. The chicken was cooked perfect with this very flavorful Chipotle cream sauce. My wife had the buckwheat pancakes and they were soft and fluffy. I will definitely be returning again."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent Haymaker as it near our home but that not the only reason.  The food is top notch and service has been great too.  We have been there a dozen or more times with only 1 service that was slow and that happened to be a very busy for them.   (Right after Christmas) all other times we have received great service in the dining area or at the bar.   We actually prefer to eat at the bar because it is comfortable and the bartenders are fabulous.   I also can't say enough about the craft beers on tap.  We love IPA's and Porters/Stouts.  There are plenty to choose from and they regularly seem to have something new on tap.  Bartenders Jill, Travis, Mandy and Lisa are top notch.  The food offerings are so wonderful as well.  Many healthy choices are available too as well as gluten free meals.  Huge plus for me.  Their blackened salmon and grilled salmon are to die for.  Burgers are stacked and tasty.  Pig wings are great too.  Every meal we have eaten there are quite tasty.  Too many to list here.  Last time we went we got to know the owner Joey. You would never have known as he was working away serving guests, cleaning up and talking with guests.  He definitely cares A lot about the restaurant,  food quality, customers, staff and seeks feedback to make Haymaker better all the time.  We will continue to frequent Haymaker regularly."}
{"text":"Stopped in for takeout. Descent food. Friendly staff. Wouldn't mind spending more time there to get a better sense for the place. Will be back."}
{"text":"Came here twice, first for dinner and then for lunch. Neither me or my wife liked dinner, our server was cool. We decided to go her for breakfast because it was nearby. My wife got the apple French toast and it was awesome! I got the pancakes which were pretty good. Would definitely go back for breakfast."}
{"text":"My husband, daughter and I all went to Haymaker for our 9 year wedding anniversary and it was SO good! I got the strawberry spinach salad with salmon on top and my husband got the apple french toast and because we went on a Wednesday we got a free kids meal when we ordered an entree! So we ordered the chocolate pancakes and everything tasted amazing! We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Can u hear that? Seriously.  It's my stomach crying for breakfast.  I had to quiet the stomach, so my wife and I stopped for the first time after our workout.  What better protein after a workout than a $3 bloody mary? How can you go wrong with that? It was nice to share one after a tough work out.  So let's get to the breakfast shall we. I had a breakfast burrito. It was a little small but delicious.  Wife had Apple French toast. She also liked her dessert. It looked like dessert.  All in all, Micaela our server was fantastic, and very attentive. Food was delicious, and the atmosphere was very relaxed and comfortable. We will definitely be back to try happy hour."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the slowest service we have ever gotten at a meal, ever.  It took 48 minutes from ordering to being served and we'd been sitting for 20 minutes before that.  Server apologized for it and gave us a gift card to come back, but it doesn't feel worth using.  We'll probably donate the gift card to someone in need."}
{"text":"Everything was good! We went for Saturday breakfast. Atmosphere was great, waitress was helpful, food was delicious!! Huevos benedictos, haymaker Benedict, French toast, and pancake were all great!"}
{"text":"I've been to each of the last 2 restaurants in this location and hope that this one can stay for a while!   I pulled in to find a new restaurant and concept and gave it a try, glad I did. The menu is actually pretty diverse, they're open from breakfast to dinner which surprised me and it's a good mix of foods .. comfort foods mostly but it's not pricey and the service is solid. The cheese fries were a hit with my kiddo and I was shocked that the Patti Melt wasn't soaked which so easily happens .. it was actually cooked to perfection.   4 stars only because I feel that there is always room for improvement."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant and the food was cold. Service was not too notch as I expected it to be since the place is located in Goodyear. I asked for my steak to be well done. I know that well done will over cook the meat but come on don't leave the meat super burnt. This was my first time here and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Went this morning for breakfast and had the best yes the best eggs Benedict I have ever had. Cooked perfect, looked perfect, was perfect. Service was excellent for our table of 12. Everyone at the table had a great meal and the waitress was amazing on key and friendly. Koodos to a great west side restaurant."}
{"text":"We really didn't have a good start for our dining experience. Our server seemed to have been sat four tables at once, including ours. Because of that she fell behind very fast. She rushed through our drink order so fast I wasn't able to order a drink for my son before she walked away. Drinks took awhile to arrive as well. We ordered fried pickles and they came fast and were quite tasty. And when the food was dropped she was prompted to get our dinner order. She apparently placed it quickly, too, because timing was beautiful for the entrees to come out.  Our server, and forgive me for forgetting her name (black hair with black rimmed glasses), had a great positive attitude, bubbly and very nice once she got caught up. And she got caught up pretty fast. So our one star start quickly rose.  We received our food, fish and chips sub onion rings, b.a.l.t., and chicken tender basket. The fish was cooked perfectly, but slightly under seasoned. No biggie. The b.a.l.t. was picture perfect. Golden brown, built nicely and not all sloppy. Just a good looking plate. The tenders, not so much. I was expecting a crusty, crunchy hand breaded tenders and these were more like cut strips of breasts dusted in seasoned flour. Like you'd make at home in the skillet.  Our server was quick to replace it with another b.a.l.t. but with regular tomato instead of fried. Again, just gorgeous. At first I thought it was also under seasoned with the avocado but then remembered that it usually comes with a fried tomato and I made the change. So with that in mind it was perfect. Great ratio of all the filling. And the fries, as silly as it sounds, but they were the example of well cooked fries. They came out almost to the overcooked point. Not greasy though, not a bit. Well seasoned, and crunchy. Cooked so perfectly that my last fry, ten or fifteen minutes after it was delivered was still crunchy.  I'll be here again, but next time in the bar which seemed very welcoming.  The only reason that I'm not giving a five star is because when our server was sat four times there were other employees that could've helped her but didn't. Although one gentleman, which I think was the manager, was supporting her and was wicked busy.  And when we were dining another employee rolled the mop bucket through the dining room. Over tile. Very, very loud and rude when people are dining.  Other than that I will definitely be back a few times over."}
{"text":"Good food, great service. If you are looking for a place to kick back and watch sports and company of friends... this is the place to go."}
{"text":"This place rocks! The service, employees, atmosphere and let's talk about the food and drinks... I have had burgers, chicken, wings, chicken fried steak, steak, salad, breakfast etc.... Never once have I been disappointed! Best time to go to is around happy hour... Drinks are bomb and the bartenders are knowledgeable, cute and make you want to sit there and spend money. I am a little pissy though with some poor comments left here....  Seriously Daniel it's too loud?! It's a restaurant/bar!  Alyssa ur muffin was hard? You complained, you \"promptly\" got a new one and the waitress apologized... Why give a 2 on this ? move on! Now Melanie p... Food positioning immediately really?! Doubtful! And according to your passed reviews this is not the first time you have alleged to have gotten food poisoning while eating out! Maybe you have a food allergy or in fact should eat at home and stop trying to get freebies. The manager did his part handling your complaint via Facebook & by telephone ! See ya Friday Haymaker ..."}
{"text":"Always love this place for bfast! Been told that their dinners are awesome too. Love their Huevos Rancheros and Huevos Benedictos! If you like chorizo, those are for you! Huge proportions and biscuits! Daughter loved the apple french toast. Chili omelette was good but not amazing. Always a crowd fave--long weekend lines at bfast and no reservations."}
{"text":"Amazing place for breakfast. Their huevos benedictos, huevos rancheros, and biscuits and gravy are three of my favorites. Beware the biscuit! It's ginormous! They do $3 mimosas, which are great to enjoy while we're having Sunday brunch. The service is always friendly and prompt. Try the French Dip for lunch."}
{"text":"Great place to have some drafts and watch sports. The wings are delicious, and so are the fried pickles. They also have happy hour prices on the weekend, and several IPAs to choose from. I recommend it."}
{"text":"Perfect breakfast stop and $3 Bloody Marys too!  Service is good and friendly staff! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Nice place, it gave me a good feeling to dine there.  The menu is full of standard American favorites, along with an assortment of pasta and asian themed dishes.  Reasonable portions, not too big or too little.   We were seated in five minutes and our server had our drink order down within 5 minutes of our seating.  My wife had \"Joey's Primavera\"  and it was good and even enough to take a bit home in a to-go container.  I had the Asian Chicken Salad and found it excellent!   Throughout our meal we got attention not only from our server but other servers as they were passing our table.  Another thing we noticed was that the staff really seemed to enjoy their work, and that the common areas were exceptionally clean for such a busy place.  We received good value for our dollar, and we will be back."}
{"text":"The service is amazing the best I've ever had the management is fantastic . Locally owned restaurant all the food I have ordered is always cocked to perfection and taste delicious!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very modern. Excellent selection on breakfast food. The biscuits are incredible and the presentation was great. Good prices for quality food. Would recommend.  Staff was knowledgable and had excellent service"}
{"text":"It was OK. Could get similar food elsewhere. We liked the 2pm-7pm everyday happy hour. Got a 16oz of Devils Ale for $3.50, which is decent. Service was slow and server must've been new. She wasn't very knowledgable and messed up an order. Probably wouldn't return if I had the choice."}
{"text":"Sal is the best. We come every week and we will continue to come.  Not just Sal, the entire team is amazing! And the food and drinks are fantastic! This has been many different restaurants and this one needs to stay!"}
{"text":"Disappointed in the bar staff here. I'm a big fan of the owner and had my rehearsal dinner here. On Saturday (3/17), at around 4:00 pm we walked into the bar area which had maybe 8 to 10 people in there l. Service was terrible from the table staff and had the glory of the overhearing the bartender and one of the waitresses complain about a large group of us walking in. If you're miserable at your job quit and collect unemployment."}
{"text":"Really good! Nice atmosphere and I loved the decor! Food was great and so was the service! 20% military discount was a pleasant surprise! We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"We split the piggy platter so we could have a taste of several different things. Food was really good but the one bad thing was our waitress, my husband asked her what was good and she said I don't know I don't eat here!! Really!! That's awesome for your new business!!"}
{"text":"The wife and I have breakfast here at least twice a month. The staff is always friendly and attentive. The food is always well prepared and tasty.  The decor is a rustic, early American with some patriotic accents.  I highly recommend the chicken fried steak, the homemade gravy is awesome. I also love their eggs benedict."}
{"text":"Went in on a Friday night for a burger (quite nice I might add) to try the place out.  Classy, rustic ambiance, good food that is unassuming and straightforward, but the whisky list- my the whisky list!  Granted, as a collector with appreciation for all whiskys, there were some notable brand omissions, but I was able to sample some rye I had some curiosity about.  Order a flight sometime and learn how to appreciate this amazing spirit.  Very agreeable menu with tasty cocktails.  The bar had no problem with making my Old Fashioned in the variation I preferred.    I really like this joint a lot.  The food is good enough for any occasion- went back the following night for the pub steak.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned, great flavor- I researched their meat sourcing- it is clearly evident they are not messing around with any old red meat.  I am picky about my proteins, it appears so is Haymaker.  This is my new home base.  Service is acceptable to good, hence the omission of 1 star, but I have pretty high standards.  It wasn't really lacking so much as it was not exceptional.  It would not prevent me from going back again and again."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, not bad on pricing either! Well done! Lots of options and kids eat free on Wednesday!! Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"They serve breakfast all day!  Lots of choices and they also have gluten-free choices.  They have burgers and other things too.  Good atmosphere.  I had the pulled pork breakfast hash and it was really good."}
{"text":"Delicious food and drinks.  Great value $$ Natalie was excellent! We had blackened salmon and blackened catfish.  Chili appetizer was yummy!!!! And really enjoyed the bread puddin'. Yummo! We will definitely go again. Maybe for breakfast tomorrow!!!"}
{"text":"Super yummy food. Waitress was great. First timer however will definitely be going back. Kids loved it."}
{"text":"My sandwich and salad were good, but my husband's ribs were tough and fatty. The ribs were served on paper, it ripped and became part of the meal. Not good."}
{"text":"Great happy hour, nice tap selection and apps. The food was good, service was quick, and the inside was very clean and spacious.  No doubt I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The decor is very Americana and the food tastes fresh and made from scratch. The service has always been very good and I love that they give military /veteran discounts.  We have been in for breakfast,  lunch and Dinner and never been disappointed.  The chicken feied chicken with mashed potatoes and white gravy with green chilli is fantastic! ! For breakfast the haymaker Benedict is a must!!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to this place since the opening. It has been a comfortable laid back kind of restaurant. The staff was friendly and the food was great."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast on Sunday morning, no crowd at all but we arrived pretty early (7:15) and they have only been open 3 weeks.    H had the huevos with chorizo it looked great and he was satisfied.  I had the veggie omelet and it was decent, lots of veg but not a lot of cheese.  H said the oj was fresh, my coffee wasn't too great it tasted like maxwell house.  It was solid for breakfast but nothing to rave about.  It's nice to have another breakfast option around this area though.  Our server September was very friendly and helpful.  I'm definitely curious to try their burgers and wings.  They have a bazillion tvs so my H wants to come back to watch a game.  It's worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Thought we would give this place a try and what a regret that was. The service is TERRIBLE. Sat there for 20 minutes before we even got a waitress to pay attention to us. Placed our order and our drink order at the same time. 10 minutes later our coffees came out without cream. Sit and waited another 5 minutes and We finally got up and left...with no cream. Wish I would have gotten the waitresses name. Service is what makes or breaks a place for me. I'm sure the food would have been great but we will never know cause we will not be back."}
{"text":"Within the past 6 months every time we eat at Haymaker, I end up peeing out of my butthole... and I'm not alone, my fam even felt the butt lava percolating in the car on the way home. We're lucky the house has 5 toilets!  I spared 2 stars because the food and cocktails are always so good, they serve breakfast all day, and the staff always leaves a stellar impression. We really do like their burgers, french toast, and huevos rancheros!  But no matter how delicious - it still feels like the food kicked in your back door and threw a Haymaker right at your intestines."}
{"text":"I had the special of the day which was some kind of breakfast burger.  It had cheese, bacon, an egg and guacamole.  It was delicious and cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"My experience here was awesome. The server was friendly, the food was fast (and yummy), and even though it was busy it wasn't overly loud. Will be returning."}
{"text":"A great family owned neighborhood restaurant. Good atmosphere and good service. We visited for breakfast and it was great. The server paid great attention to detail. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Had the gringo hamburger it was excellent. Salsa was a little too hot for my mom but i thought it was fabulous. I also has a house margaritas which was good too in a cute little mason jar glass. Wish their blender want broken so i could have had a frozen margaritas. The fries were also perfect. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food and service - excellent. Three out of the four of us had burgers - all delish. At the recommendation of our server, Steve, I  had the burger of the month (fajita burger) - super good. The other two had the Arizona burger and both loved them. Hubby had the catfish tacos and raved about them. We were sorry that we were so full we couldn't try their desserts. Next time, because there WILL be a next time!"}
{"text":"The service was great. Once I found the front door, my issue. I had breakfast after all it was 2:30pm. Three eggs over medium sausage and country potato and I opted for a chocolate chip pancake. Yummy."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent The Haymaker often, but never again.  The service has always been a hit or miss depending on the server. The food, always good. Problem? We went on a Sunday morning with our 2 year old son. We were told 20 min wait, no problem. We waited for 45 min and watched numerous large parties be sat ahead of us even though they came in after us. Each time we checked in with the young hostess, she acted as if there were only one high chair in the entire restaurant, but insisted we were next each time we asked. We finally decided to leave, hungry. We told the hostess we were leaving and she acted relieved. Because of this one bad experience,  we will never come back."}
{"text":"We've been here many times since they opened. Every time has been a good experience. We really like the atmosphere and the food is excellent. We have our favorites, but we like to try everything on the menu. We have had several servers and they treat us very well. The Manager is a bit full of himself. He knows we are regulars, but never gives us the attention he does the other people that have been there several times. That kind of bothers us, but now we just ignore him and enjoy our time there. We don't come to see him anyways! We come for the food! We like the happy hour much better then Applebees. Much better crowd of people and better food.   One thing that makes us laugh is the amount of people that can't get over the fact that it is no longer Caballero Grill. I hear people asking if they can use their gift cards there. It's not the same restaurant or people! It's a much better restaurant, much better service, and better place all around."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere,  good service.  Fabulous buffalo chicken sandwich on Texas toast!  Hubby loved the fish and chips."}
{"text":"Really sad they changed their happy hour to end at 7. $5 apps are sadly gone, now only $2 off. Tiny wine selection. The burgers are good & they offer GF buns. The fries are great, BLT was good, their bbq, wing sauces and salad dressings are great! Highly recommend the pork sandwhich & wings w/ rhythm sauce. Also this place is Gluten free friendly. $$"}
{"text":"Food is a 4 but  their service is a 2 at best. Wish I could rate higher but their ability to consistently provide bad service disallows me to."}
{"text":"Visited a few times for breakfast and dinner and have not been disappointed. Food is good and service is to standard."}
{"text":"We ordered the fish and chips.  Both needed more seasoning.  The tartar sauce was good, which gave the fish more zest.  Coleslaw was enjoyable.   We shared the bread pudding for dessert, which is the only dessert.   They do have alcohol milk shakes.  Alexis was our server, she was friendly and courteous.   We want to try breakfast next time."}
{"text":"I have been coming here on a fairly regular basis since they first opened and have always been a fan. Food is always good and prices are reasonable, especially during happy hour."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the new menu! I used to be a regular because of the home cooked meals! Now it is just bar food. Probably won't be back. Dang I really loved that Country Fried Steak.                                                                             I am back! Thank you for bringing back the Country Fried Steak. I will be there at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place and incredible breakfast definitely go hungry their portions are huge and well worth the money. Great family place or even just save happy hour in the bar or a Sunday Bloody Mary"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my bbq chicken salad. My only complaint is they definitely cheat you on the chicken. I had MAYBE two ounces worth. I guess they assume if they pile enough toppings on it, you won't notice.  Also, our server was ... quirky. Like, in an awkward,not funny way."}
{"text":"We visited Haymaker for lunch on a Thursday. It was odd to walk in--we were regulars here when it was McGrath's and then Caballero, and the building evolves with each new occupant. The place was busy. Everyone was friendly and the service was very good. We were asked if we needed anything every few minutes.  My husband tried their house ale and liked it very much. He ordered the Country Fried Steak. The presentation wasn't the most appetizing--you can see the pic--but the steak had a nice crispyness so that it didn't go all soggy in its gravy bath. The scoop of mashed potatoes had a homemade look, with peels in it. The veggies, as my husband put it, \"tasted like they came straight out of a Birdseye bag.\" So, that was a meh aspect. It was an overall okay meal by him. Nothing extraordinary.   I had the Strawberry and Avocado Salad. The size was good and the spinach was all fresh, and it wasn't drowned in dressing. I would have liked a little more avocado--it seems like half a small avocado was on there--but the other toppings were fine in quantity. Again, it didn't strive to be anything fancy. I do think nearby Saddle Mountain had a better version of this and theirs included delicious grilled chicken breast for about the same price.  We had a good impression of the place. For basic home-style cuisine, this is certainly MUCH preferable to Cracker Barrel, and my husband can get beer on tap, too. I could envision bringing my parents here when they're in town for a visit."}
{"text":"So my last review was not good. I did receive a response offering to buy dinner, which was appreciated, not something I felt right accepting. I have been back twice now and am very happy to say both times were great! The staff has been very interactive & the food delicious. Haymaker is again a favorite close to home spot.... One request, PLEASE keep the pastrami sandwich on the menu"}
{"text":"Great chicken fried chicken. Moist tender juicy. Mashed potatoes were creamy.  Import beers and multiple screens."}
{"text":"I'm NEVER easily impressed when it comes to restaurants, which my hubby has grown to love:)  But SERIOUSLY, from the second we walked in we were welcomed with an enthusiastic welcome from the Hostess, like she was ACTUALLY glad to see us!   Once we got seated was where the real fun began, and it all started with our AMAZING server Jenna, in fact she turned out to be one of the best servers we had EVER had, as in EVER!  We loved the beer selection ( ice cold IPA, yes please!) and we even tried a whisky flight, that we loved.  BUT the topper were the RIBS!  SO when Jenna told us they were melt in your mouth, fall of the bone, she was not KIDDING!  I will dream about these until we come back again:)  Do not think twice about going here!  It rocked!!!!"}
{"text":"I am starting to see the reason why we never have a wait when going to this restaurant. While the food is decent, the wait staff is severely lacking in orders and memory! Last time the waitress screwed up our order several times, and this time the same thing happened. Also last time they couldn't figure out our Groupon like they had never done it before. Nothing horrible, but she brought hash browns instead of potatoes and then my eggs were cold. I ordered an extra meal to go and she messed that up too thinking I ordered just eggs. Then someone else brought our meal minus the potatoes and she messed up the eggs again!! I am not planning to return unfortunately."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch with my family and for our first time,  it wasn't a good experience.  Granted,  they just opened 7 weeks ago,  but the service was slow and forgetful. The food was ok,  my husband had to complain about his \"cardiologist\" burger being over done, but management was cool enough to take it off the check and no,  my husband didn't eat it. Unfortunately, we won't be back,  should've gone to Rudy's like we originally wanted to. Very unfortunate,  seems like a cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"great with a family with kids!! food was good, staff is very friendly. pork chop and bbq was very good. plenty of food"}
{"text":"Love how awesome the Gluten Free menu!!! Love that they also have cider in tap!!!!!  The family loves their regular menu but we are so grateful we can come here and I can enjoy everything just like everyone else!!! Here tonight ordering take out just for me... Gluten free wings!!! It's a must visit place, also a place to call your favorite place!!! My favorite bar tender was on taking care of everyone, thank you April!!!"}
{"text":"It took over a half hour for the food to arrive and then three of the four plates were wrong and had to be sent back.  This didn't even warrant a visit to the table from the manager.  _ Update: The management contacted me very quickly to make up for the experience we had and assure me that they will deal with the issues in training their staff."}
{"text":"We've been here several times for breakfast. The ambience and decor are very comfortable and nice. The food has always been good,coffee is excellent. Service here is very friendly,and these guys love military people-which is refreshing! The guy at the host desk is always very friendly and helpful. I wish we could still sit in the main room,but they are renovating things and the bar area is what you get now. We will keep coming back,and I cannot wait to try lunch!!"}
{"text":"Found this place for breakfast based on Yelp reviews. Not disappointed--good service, comfortable atmosphere, excellent food!"}
{"text":"First time here and me and my husband loved it! We shared the Texan burger, the grown up grilled cheese, sweet potato fries and the chili. All were amazing and worthy enough to order again next time. Definitely coming back again. We had great service. Our waiters name was Glen and he did an excellent job. Can't believe we waited so long to come check this place out!!"}
{"text":"I love The Haymaker. When I first moved to the neighborhood I went in to see what it was like. I felt right at home from the start!  I didn't know anyone in the area so I went in alone and I was skeptical. The Bartender Sal treated me like he knew me for years and made me feel very safe and comfortable.  I like to stop in for Happy Hour and get something to eat so I don't have to go home to cook and eat alone. Sal always takes the time to talk to me and makes me feel right at home.  Sal works fast behind the bar waiting on all the customers and making sure everyone is happy with their order. The food is very good. I like the Thursday burger specials, fried zucchini and the new rubbed wings! I highly recommend THE HAYMAKER  Elaine W."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and have mixed thoughts. My husband ordered the TBLAT sandwich and is delicious. Good bread which makes the sandwich. I ordered the French dip which I could not eat. The beef was sliced very thick and was very tough. I left it on the plate. The chairs are wooden which makes for an unpleasant dining experience. I believe that wooden/metal chairs are to insure a quick turn around as guests will not stay very long. My husband walked to check out the booth seating and the cushions were torn and sunken in. They need to be updated/repaired.  For the high prices and terrible seats, I will not return.  6/15/2017 After manager reached out to me I returned for another try. We were sat immediately in a newly covered booth and seats were so comfortable! Ordered the blackened fish tacos, they were delicious!  Manager also said they were in the process of replacing the hard wooden chairs which should encourage patrons to stay longer, maybe order that second drink! Nice to see a restaurant putting its money back into the establishment! I applaud you!"}
{"text":"Been now three times.  Great little neighborhood restaurant, my family is rooting for them.  Overall good quality food for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and friendly/professional service at fair prices.  My only quibble is despite how delicious the wings are (including the rhythm sauce), the price seems to be way too high, like $1 per wing.  Perhaps if the wings were super big/meaty I'd be ok with the cost, but this seems on the high side despite the rest of your prices being super fair.  Both Albert and September were fantastic servers.  Kudos.  With that being said, be careful guys, the word around the neighborhood and my mother in law is that service and food quality are starting to slip.  Let's get back on track."}
{"text":"Food is good. Lunch prices are great and Happy Hour is everyday. Mellow atmosphere and good service."}
{"text":"Their breakfast variety is wonderful. I had the green chili omelette. It was cooked perfectly and the green chili was fresh.  The service was quick and efficient. The manager visited my table to make sure everything was good.   The portions are larger then most breakfast restaurants.  The only thing I would improve on is their coffee. They serve a generic Shamrock brand coffee. A fresher and better choice would be from a local coffee roaster like Passport Coffee in Scottsdale. Especially since this family owned restaurant is promoting that they are a local company.   I will be back at night with some friends next month to try their Texan burger."}
{"text":"This was our first time here.  It is now our new go to breakfast place.  Great food and service!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Litchfield Park and found this restaurant through Yelp while looking for breakfast. They serve breakfast all day! Nice staff, decent food. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"My Mom and I stopped in for lunch last week, maybe Tuesday or Wednesday, at a little before noon. We were seated right away, the restaurant wasn't busy.  Iced teas were served in average time.  I ordered the TAB (turkey, avocado, bacon) sandwich with sweet potato fries.  My Mom wanted to order the half sandwich/salad option.  She wanted the same TAB sandwich and one of their salad items, a strawberry something salad.  She was told that the only salad options were a garden or ceasar salad, so she opted for a garden salad.  It took easily 30 mins for the order to arrive.    In the meantime, the restaurant started to fill and it became obvious there were only two servers working the entire south side of the restaurant.  The order arrived and my mother's order was wrong.  She was given a full sandwich with a side salad which, once we got the bill, we realized the waitress got wrong and did a salad substitution instead of the other sandwich side options which added almost $2 to the bill.  Given that the waitress pointed out the half sandwich options, not sure why the order wasn't correct.  She was completely unavailable to straighten it out.  For a sandwich that is named with avocado sharing the spotlight with turkey and bacon, it isn't unthinkable to expect a few actual slices of avocado in there.  Both sandwiches had so little avocado, I had to take a pic and include it with the review.  The bread was average whole wheat bread.  A better quality of bread could have really upped that game.  One highlight was the battered sweet potato fries.     Would I try this restaurant again?  Probably not.  We're lunch diners and with Wildflower Bread Co down the street, their food is so much better."}
{"text":"The food was edible the one thing I really liked  was The chili chicken nachos and the waitress was very friendly"}
{"text":"On Mother's Day we waited an hour. We had a big pray and there were a lot of people. The staff were doing the best they could with the hand they were dealt. Plenty of rude customers to go around. Once we got in and to our table the server was very on top of things. Our food arrived in no time. They took care of business. The food was very good and I was surprised at how reasonable all the prices were. I would come back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is good for brunch or a casual meal. The staff is very nice and the atmosphere is relaxed. I haven't made it past the breakfast menu yet, but so far everything is very good. They also have an excellent selection of whiskey, if you're into that sort of thing."}
{"text":"We chose Haymaker for dinner on a Friday night we were pleasantly surprised that there was not a wait. We were seated promptly, our waitress Tiffany was there within a few minutes to take our drink order. Drinks were delivered very quickly (even the ones from the bar) we ordered food and it was all delivered to our table in less than 15 minutes. Food was good, very sizable portions a great value on my opinion. Our waitress was great very personable, and seemed genuinely happy to be working there and to be waiting on us."}
{"text":"I suppose people might come for the food.  I had a yummy California omelette (bacon, cheddar, onion, tomato, avocado) at a fair price that wasn't mind-blowing, but it was cheesy enough that I had to cut my bites off better to avoid a stringy cheese strand like the kind in Anthony Keidis's mouth it the Chili Pepper's \"Give it away\" music video.    But I think they probably come for the ambiance, which is so rodeo-whiskey-bar meets 3rd- grade-patriotic-unit meets meets Trump-rally that I could have farted \"God Bless the USA\" after eating."}
{"text":"Had the Haymaker Benedict!! Amazing :) hubby had pulled pork skillet - wasn't quite hot enough and they made it right immediately! Great food great service!! We will be back :)"}
{"text":"**Amending my review based on the amazing response from management** They responded to my review in a very professional manner and a return visit is in order!! One more star for such a courteous response.   Tried this place on a weekday for an early afternoon breakfast. Service was ok yet for the amount of people nearby, sort of slow. Typical breakfast fare offered yet the descriptions of the items state \"with meat\". I was expecting a good size portion of carnivorous offerings yet I was disappointed that meant one sausage (although rather plump).  For the amount of money ($10-12) per plate, the portions sizes were not comparable and I would probably not rush out to Haymakers again."}
{"text":"We enjoy going to the Haymaker occasionally. On Wednesday the kids eat free, which is a nice thing that they get pretty excited about. They get pancakes. The entrees are a fair value. The salads are good portion size. Last time I tried the grilled tuna sandwich. It was tasty. So, all in all, we like this place."}
{"text":"We have been in several times alreadyvand have never been disappointed.  The burgers were good as well as the fries. Very friendly and accomadating overall.  Owner there and stops to say hi. Happy hour has great menu and prices. Food good. Staff improved with each visit..  Nice to have restaurant like this so close."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant. When we first moved here, we visited this restaurant quite frequently. Love their bone in garlic Parmesan wings! They have great deals each day of the week, and their prices aren't even steep to begin with. They have pretty good breakfast too. My kids love their French toast sticks."}
{"text":"Awesome place. We have been here a number of times, breakfast lunch and dinner! Total winner for all 3! The service is always great, always able to watch a game, and never walk out of here hungry or dissatisfied!   No matter who is taking care of us that day, other servers check on us as they walk by!   The food is always on point. For the burgers you can switch out the meat type for a bean burger, turkey or chicken!   We always make our way here when we are in AZ!"}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday brunch, and was lucky enough to have Angel for our waitress (as previous reviewers suggested). She is worth all that is said, a delightful and funny person. Food was outstanding. Dutch apple French toast was great, with apple and cinnamon in the tasty bread. My wife raved over the mushroom omelet. We were fortunate to arrive early enough, as there was a large waiting line as we left. We will be back on this trip to Goodyear, probably more than just once."}
{"text":"Love the ribbies! The meat falls off the bone! Also, the grown-up grilled cheese is spectacular!"}
{"text":"After telling ourselves a dozen times that we want to try this place, tonight we finally followed through. We were not disappointed. We had breakfast for dinner and thought it was really good. The restaurant itself is clean.  We didn't have to clean crumbs off the booth before being seated. (If you like to do this, go to Macayos.). Food was very tasty and the staff was nice and friendly. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast on a Sunday morning.  We used to go to Bill Johnson's Big Apple since they had a good breakfast and good prices, but had no where else to go since it closed.  Glad we discovered Haymaker.  It looked busy from the outside when we arrived, but having been to the restaurant before in its previous forms (McGrath's and Caballero) we knew that it's a big building with lots of seating.  Sure enough, we were seated immediately. No complaints about the service.  The server was very kind and the food came out quickly and was great.  My wife had the Cowboy Platter.  Standard breakfast fare and she said everything was cooked exactly how she wanted it and tasted great.  We ordered the blueberry pancakes and sausage in a kid's meal for our 2 1/2 year old. The kitchen made a mistake and sent it out with bacon, but when we questioned it, the server who brought out our food brought a sausage out to us within minutes without any hesitation.  I had the breakfast burrito.  It was very tasty but a little smaller than I would have liked.  I would probably order something more like what my wife had, which was more than enough food.  All in all, it was delicious and exactly what we were looking for as our new breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Hands down best chicken fingers one could hope for. Just please extend the evening hours a bit. Perhaps a reverse happy hour? Good breakfast too, (bloody Mary's)."}
{"text":"Service was great, friendly and prompt. My wife had a salad with various fruits and walnuts. She said it was very good. I had the St. Louis Ribs. The Orrin was good but it was very fatty. We found the prices to be a little in the high side. We will come back again but, I won't have the ribs!!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast had someone seat us  behind the bar they were having a conversation laughing giggling unprofessional waited waited some other party came in seated across from us they were served first wondering why they passed us up waited then we just left and told them they need to get there waiting service in order"}
{"text":"I went back here for dinner. Gave it another shot. The whole restaurant was remodeled. It is now a sports bar. Pool, darts, shuffleboard, etc.... If you have been to arenas it is very similar but more open with more windows. It is nice inside. And the food is good. Three stars is because I just don't think sports bars get over three stars.   Two stars is generous. And it is only because the manager comped our table. The wait was excessively long because we requested a table. There was confusion over who was taking our table so we didn't even get waters for 10 minutes after we sat down. It would be a forgiving number to say an hour and 45 minutes is how long it took us from walking in the door until we got food. Once we were sat and we had our order in there was still at least 30 minutes till we got our food. Then half of the meals at our table were not even hot and the server spilled coffee on me. I don't think he even noticed it, as he walked away without saying anything. Even though he was full of excuses (he called them reasons, what a copout) the manager did the right thing and took care of our table (this is also a forgiving fact, as he avoid our table like the plague and made us ask for it) after such a lousy experience. Their lunch menu looks incredible and there were a few things on the breakfast menu that I still wanted to try. So I think I will give them another try. It looked like other tables around us we're getting in and out and having good experiences. So if they do better next time I will upgrade their review. But if you don't count for the fact that our meal was free this place would have one star. Because other than the fact that he bought it for us it was the worst service experience I've had in a really really really long time. It's worth noting that the other two locations have good reviews from good friends of mine. And if the menu looks good to you, you may be better served going to the other two locations and avoiding this one."}
{"text":"Just went to the new one in Goodyear.  Food was good.  I had the ribs which was ok but my grandson had a burger which he raved about.  We will definitely be going again.  Several other items I want to try especially breakfast.  Our waitress -- Tiffany was great -- very helpful and understanding.  Soooo glad there's a new restaurant in goodyear!!!"}
{"text":"I was expecting this place to be better than it was. We started with fried pickles and cheese fries. Fried pickles weren't fried well. The breading fell off the pickle easily. French fries were below average. Shredded cheese was half way melted. Waiter replaced with a better melted plate but still not impressed. My girl ordered the Grown up Grilled Cheese with no bacon and a side of mashed potatoes. Fried tomato stuffed inside the grilled cheese. It was pretty good. My girl's mom liked her tuna melt and fries (Cajun fries mixed with sweet potato fries). I ordered wings. Wings were small but pretty good. Blue cheese was watered down badly."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service . We will be back for sure. Wish we have found this place sooner."}
{"text":"It wasn't busy.  Ordered a burger and salmon.  Asked for spinach with burger since it was offered for salmon.  No, we don't do that.  Not \"I'll check\", just \"that's only for salmon\" except the salmon orderer didn't order it.  Both ordered side salads.  No offer and no action to bring them early.  Burger order wasn't asked how they'd like it cooked.  And it wasn't done medium.  It was underdressed.  Wait for mustard was 5 minutes.    By the time it arrived, All the glasses were empty, and all the plates were taken away, leaving one person to eat alone because mustard took forever.   Don't recommend.  Meh food, under dressed burgers and bad service."}
{"text":"Decided to give Haymaker a try for lunch. It was very busy and the wait was approximately 35 minutes. I was very hungry and ordered the Texan Burger (bacon, BBQ sauce, cheese, and haystack onions). It was delicious! My parents also got burgers and thought they were very good, in addition to their sweet potato fries. Great work, Haymaker! I'll be back."}
{"text":"the man-mosa was the reason we were drawn to this place -  we were not disappointed!! Best drink idea ever. Breakfast was okay and I'd never seen chorizo made as a patty so I probably won't order that again with my food however the service was great and prices were completely reasonable."}
{"text":"The breakfast is super awesome the best toast I ever had .. they have a great selection of ranch egg Breakfast or burrito or biscuits and gravy .. I do not recommend the mimosas here , they come in a weird little shot type glass and they hold about 4 sips so I suggest another beverage . In spite of that the place is cozy with a family atmosphere, lively but you can still hear your partner talk :)"}
{"text":"So far it's just OK! 1st Drinks took forever(but taste good) we have a sticky table top (buss staff need to be trained on cleaning tables thoroughly!! Top and edges!!) TVs can't be switched, waitress brought only 1 water! Nobody smiles!!! Nobody is attentive!!! Customer service is NOT their strong suit!!!   Manager just came by and apologized which was great! I only post reviews in the hope that it HELPS them fix issues! I hope they don't get mad at the server! Food was amazing last time we came for the Saints game last year!!  Haven't ordered yet today! Trying the fried pickles!!! second drink came quick!!! FRIED PICKLES ARE AMAZING!!!  I am now home in California and I WILL come back here because the food is great!! Hoping the managers will talk to the staff about being a little happier and more enthusiastic about serving their customers."}
{"text":"The Haymaker is hands-down the best restaurant in the valley of the sun. I am a prior Phoenix resident but have lived in San Diego for the past seven years. Every time I make a trip back to Arizona I always make sure we stop at the Haymaker at least once if not twice because it is a must!!!! The staff are always friendly and welcoming. Being a military spouse, I can truly appreciate how much they support those who serve as well as the families. Keep up the superb service, food and patriotic atmosphere!!!! See you again in a few weeks!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down a 5. Not crowded, awesome decor and GREAT service. Very much appreciated the 20% military discount. Excellent food. My beer was served in a ball mason type jar. Happy hour is from 2pm - 7pm. First thing I saw was the pledge of allegiance on the wall when I walked in and thought damn right, this is America and I'm ordering a steak!"}
{"text":"I came here on a trip to the valley for lunch. Wed heard about their burgers so we had to try them.   We weren't disappointed. The burgers were flavorful but not greasy. The arizona looked better than my texan and the green chili was perfect on it.  The onion strings on mine were good and also not greasy.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Date of restaurant visit: 03/22/2014  I was in Arizona for baseball spring training in March.  I was watching the Phoenix Fox 10 morning show and one of the hosts, Andrea Robinson, did a segment on the Haymaker Restaurant.  So, I went there for dinner and arrived in time for Happy Hour.  I sat in the bar and was promptly attended to by the bartender.  She took my drink order while I looked over the menu.  I ordered the Texan with grilled chicken.  The chicken sandwich was topped with bacon, haystack onions, cheddar cheese and BBQ sauce.  The sandwich was very good.  I ordered a side of sweet potato fries.  They were crispy on the outside and also very good.  I was very pleased with the food and great service and will return the next time I'm in Phoenix.  Fox 10 segment on The Haymaker Restaurant: http://www.myfoxphoenix.com/Clip/9970928/taste-of-the-town-haymaker-restaurant-co"}
{"text":"amazing breakfast!  I suggest eating at the bar if there is a wait, it is first come, first served in there~save us from having to wait over 30 minutes for Sunday morning breakfast.  Can't wait to go back there to try other deliciousness from their menu.  Breakfast is served all day."}
{"text":"Sat down and we got our drinks right away. The place was not busy and 15 minutes later we still hadn't placed our order. When our server started to clean a table next to us instead of taking our order it was time to leave. Won't be back.     Update:  I am going to pass this off as just one of those days. I reluctantly went back and the service was outstanding. Service was spot on and the food was well prepared and we had a very nice meal. I have been back several time since and enjoyed each time. Would definitely change my review to 5 stars. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Upon walking in the first thing I noticed was the Pledge of Alliance proudly displayed on the wall. After being seated and having ordered from a very polite waiter, I took my time looking around. Everywhere is some form of patriotic saying. I also saw a prayer on the wall. I felt the American Pride, American love, American respect. How was the food?  I had the standard eggs and hash browns. Good food nothing fantastic.   Will I come here again? If I'm in the west valley, Yes! Good service, good food, and love of country. One can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Everytime I go I try something new on the menu, it is all very good. Haymaker is one of our favorites! The last time we went I ordered something that I have not tried yet and I didn't care for it. (You can't please all the people all of the time right). The waitress offered me another meal and took it off my bill. They have excellent customer service and excellent food! Thanks Haymaker!!"}
{"text":"Consistently good food. Prices are reasonable. Can't go wrong with breakfast or burgers. Service can be hit or miss. Food can come out a bit slow which is understandable, always busy."}
{"text":"Best catfish meal ever will be back hopefully sooner than later. Great service and fun people"}
{"text":"We went The Haymaker for lunch for the first time today. We both ordered the French dip. It was very good!! It ranks as the very best one I have eaten for the price!!! It had fresh grilled mushrooms and onions on a very tasty bun!!  The fries tasted like they were fresh cut, with the skins still on. Not sure if they are fresh cut but, if not, they fooled me!!  We could hear the people behind us commenting on how good the wings were!   Because this place is new, the atmosphere is crisp and clean. I LOVE the fact that this place is patriotic, with lots of decor that honors America!!  They have a list of whiskeys that outnumber the all menu items. Although it seems as if the place would feel like a bar because they tout that they offer by far more whiskey choices than other restaurants and bars, surprisingly enough, it's mostly restaurant. They do have a bar off to one side, out of view of the dining area, but it probably takes up about 20% of the square footage.  This place is quite large, much larger than we expected from looking at it from the outside.   They serve breakfast. They had a good crowd there finishing up breakfast when we got there at 11:00, so breakfast must be good too!  The service was very good and very friendly!  I highly recommend giving this place a try. I know we'll go back!!!!"}
{"text":"My EX-Mother in law lives in this area. We have the other location near our home and we frequent it often. When recently meeting up with one of my best friends (yes, my EX mother in law), I recommended Haymaker. It's close to her house and since she doesn't like to drive it was a perfect choice.   I always enjoy the AMAZING French dip, and she enjoyed hers as well!! It is by FAR my favorite French dip ever!!!!  The owner has had quick success, having opened at least 3 locations within just a few years!! OBVIOUSLY, the food and booze is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, how disappointing. The pig wings have gone from the menu, so my wife ordered ribs. Too tough to eat. My Caeser salad was all ends and my chili cold. At least the coleslaw is still decent and the iced tea drinkable . We won't be back, and for that I'm sad because a few months back this place was great."}
{"text":"I've been a few times now, and consistently had good service and great food.  The french fries are awesome, and they serve the best Bloody Mary I've ever tasted. It's typically hard to find a place my whole family can agree on, but we all love this place!"}
{"text":"Not a great experience. Had to ask for more bacon in the BLTA, one slice for that sandwich was not enough. Ice cold sweet potato fries. Not just cold on top and warm below, cold all the way through. The rest of the food was enjoyed. Big mix up was at the end. The wrong bill was brought, then the wrong credit card was charged. Accidents happen, but we did not feel any concern for the situation. After these two incidents the manager never came over to talk to us. Which was the least that could have been done since we have to wait 2-3 days to get credited back the $40 that was incorrectly charged.   Not the worst choice, but there are others out there for a lunch on Saturday in the area.  Ate 5/12/18 2pm."}
{"text":"So, I previously wrote a review based on our lunch experience and this is the breakfast review. The dichotomy between the bar service area (to your right as you enter the establishment) and the family dining area (to the left), are noticeable and not unwelcome.  The ambiance, with a nod toward the traditional, on the left side is as welcome as the dark paneled, whiskey  rich right side, but yet so different. We have had breakfast here twice and were impressed both times. The servers here were attentive, the decor inviting, and in the ultimate measure...the food, the restaurant excelled. In our two breakfast visits, we sampled a traditional pancake breakfast (Griddle Breakfast), eggs benedict, biscuits and gravy and the chicken fried steak. All of the food was cooked and presented very well. The sheer variety of the Benedicts makes the visit worth while. Seriously, maybe the best breakfast in the Goodyear area. Come here if you get a chance. So why not five stars: Two things and neither is a show stopper. The first is sort of odd food pairings. I got a chicken fried steak that came served on top of a mammoth biscuit. Add the choice of potato (hash browns or country potatoes) and the starch fest is truly underway. I am sure that I could have substituted toast for the biscuit, but didn't think to ask and was just awed at the mound o food. The dish was well prepared though, and really, I guess when you order chicken fried steak, calories shouldn't be a concern. I was just surprised at the largeness of the biscuit (think Black Bearish for those of you who have been there). The second surprise was that the biscuits and gravy had no egg. I know in some locales, that is normal, but a one or two egg option with this dish would be welcome and is really rather traditional. The Benedicts were perfectly cooked though, and the Chorizo in the griddle breakfast are formed to appear like a typical patty sausage, but with tons of flavor and not nearly the grease content of some Chorizos. So, while I think the menu could benefit with some tweaking, it is certainly not enough to keep me away. Well done!"}
{"text":"I'm here already 35 min and still haven't gotten our food. What's going on in the kitchen when this restaurant is empty on a Saturday night. Maybe this explains why it's empty."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience of my life!  I will never return and I suggest you don't either unless you want to be argued with about your order by the bus staff that delivers your food and then have the manager dismiss the issue like it's your fault.  Mistakes happen, the waitress came out and explained that the bus girl grabbed the wrong plate.  That's not the issue.   The issue is that they were rude, argumentative and I walked out after one bite of food because of the customer experience!  I will NEVER return and we used to go here often!  Worst experience ever!"}
{"text":"Went last night, amazing food and service, we'll be back often.  The waiter joked and made a fun night for us and our friends."}
{"text":"Super friendly service but the food was disgusting. BBQ ribs had 2 long pieces of soft cartilage sticking out like long tentacles :0 worst cut of meat I have ever seen...especially for the $$..everything was also cold! Breakfast a little better"}
{"text":"Went today for Mother's Day brunch- free mimosa so that started REALLY well. Seated right away, food came out fast, service was good. If you're feeling breakfast have a Benedict!! So delicious! I got the huevos benedictos which was a lil spicy, so creamy and my eggs were perfect.  Hubby got Haymaker Benedict and it was HUGE. He barely made it through that."}
{"text":"We came back after the manager reached out to us and gave it another try and it was amazing. The service was wonderful and the entire staff was very friendly. Our food was cooked perfectly and we were really pleased with our visit. I'm so happy the manager took time to reach out and make things right with us. We will be coming back often now!!   Our service was mediocre. I ordered the Wrangler with a chicken breast substitute for hamburger with fries. I actually thought the breast was worth the price and it was pretty good. My fries were very cold though but good potato cut fries. I ordered a margarita that took 15 minutes to make and there was 4 people in the entire place eating. It was in a mason jar for $8 filled to the brim with ice and I must say its a total rip off!!!  I had 3 stars originally but I'm not changing it to two because our experience keeps getting worse as we are sitting here."}
{"text":"Thanks to our Waitress Melissa we had a great experience here. Melissa was very sweet, very professional and very knowledgeable about the menu offering us a chock full of suggestions.  The haymaker is a cozy family run restaurant offering breakfast, lunch and dinner all day. The portions are the perfect size and the prices are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"We've come here several times and overall enjoy the food. Good variety of food with many hearty dishes. I enjoy their breakfasts too. Shane was super friendly and very attentive to my sons severe food allergies. Excellent service!"}
{"text":"Seriously how hard is it to make gravy? Burnt every time. Slow service. I seriously try to like this place but it is an overpriced sub par place."}
{"text":"THEY HAVE THE. BEST. PATTY. MELT!  We came here during happy hour today, and had a great time! We ordered the fried zucchini, the Texan burger with regular fries, and the Patty Melt with sweet potato fries. I LOVED the sweet potato fries, and that patty melt was astounding. My fiancé loved the Texan.The service was great, too! Next time, I will be splurging for a craft beer pint. ;)"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here on Friday.very underwhelming!  This is the third time I've been here for breakfast and he second time the eggs etc arrived room temperature. Will not be coming back"}
{"text":"Great breakfast with a fairly wide variety of options. BIG portions, so you won't leave hungry. My Arizona omelette was delish."}
{"text":"On my very first visit to The Haymaker, I ordered a simple breakfast with a muffin on the side. When my food was delivered, the muffin was cold, hard, and seemed very overcooked. Once I had mentioned the issue to our waitress, she promptly brought out my new muffin, but before she left, she apologized and said \"Sorry about that, that muffin was from yesterday.\" The service and other elements of my meal were fine, but the fact that they would even give me a muffin from the day before just disgusts me. It was really the most unpleasant baked good that I have ever eaten, and the waitress' blunt response about giving me an old muffin really surprised me.  I reluctantly was taken back to the Haymaker by my family for lunch and my burger and sweet potato fries were very typical and fine to eat, but by first experience there has swayed my opinion of the restaurant as a whole. I will not recommend this place, seeing as there are better options with fresher food in the northwestern region of Phoenix."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. We stopped in for a family breakfast and had a great time. I look forward to trying out the menu later in the day and enjoying some sports.  We sat in the restaurant area, away from the bar, since we had young kids in tow. We were initially a little hesitant taking the kids into a sports bar, but we should not have worried. The kids breakfast choices were well received by the munchkins (can you say chocolate chip pancakes?) and at five bucks each were reasonably priced given that beverages were included.   The highlight of the visit (for me) involved a random bison head that was positioned above our table. I convinced the five year old in our party that the rear end of the bison could be seen on the other side of the wall. Apparently the five year old was not the most immature person at our table.   The adult breakfast menu was much more extensive than I expected. I thought I was visiting a sports bar that also served food, but it's really a restaurant that also serves alcohol. And happens to have a lot of televisions. The breakfast menu included eggs benedict(s), pancakes, omelets, a senior menu... We opted for some pancakes and a green chili omelet. Great.  Service was friendly and attentive. We had visits to our table from a manager and from a cook who wanted to check out the glaze in the eyes of the five year old eating the chocolate chip pancakes. Perhaps it was just that they weren't particularly busy, but we felt very welcome and it definitely reinforced our desire to return. Probably bumped the review rating from four to five stars as well.   I understand Haymaker is locally owned and that this is their third location. They're housed on the South side of Bell Road, just West of Tatum. FYI, it's easy to drive by without noticing even though it's right on Bell. A great breakfast stop and a solid sports bar alternative.  Oh, by the way. The five year old checked out the other side of the wall and, much to her relief, there was no bison rear end in sight."}
{"text":"This is one of the best casual restaurants! We moved to this area a few months ago and have eaten here several times. We have never had a bad meal. Everything is delicious!!!"}
{"text":"First and foremost, I walked in and was greeted quickly by the manager Manny with a handshake.  We had 10 in our party and yes it was a party..Lol. They, meaning the host and busser, simultaneously started marring tables together and were seated within 4 minutes. I had heard Friday night was bomb.dot.com fish n chip Nighy and YES it was..  The fish was perfectly fried and I tore up the tarter sauce.  I was served 2 delicious, cold,clean tap line tasting, 32oz coors lights.  As a group we stated in the beginning we were separate check.... Adrian, (spelling) our server was a freakin rock star!!  He was patient, kind, attentive, and hustling.  I don't Yelp review often, but when I do, I take the time to speak the truth good or bad!? With so many restaurant options in a city of 3.5 million, I will definitely be a return customer. Well played #Haym aker"}
{"text":"Great food. All home made! Its hard to find that anymore. Only been there for lunch so far. The Mac and Cheese rocks."}
{"text":"Went to watch the game here. Wasn't crazy packed and the wings were amazing.  Also had a Prickly Pear Margarita which was also delicious.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Went to dinner with my family of 6,  showed up minutes late for happy hour but wanted wings john our server gave us the happy hour price anyway.my fiancé and I ordered a salad and a bowl of chili to split.  The chili was not great so we asked if we could send it back. Jill the manager came out and apologized for the chili and told us she not only took the chili off our bill but also took the wings off the bill. She went above and beyond to give us great customer service. The wings were amazing and the southwest chicken salad was great too!"}
{"text":"Just finished breakfast at this restaurant.   This is the third week in a row that they could not get the toast right. It has come out barely warm and limp - not toasted at all.  Sent back Mom's this morning and the second batch came out burned.  We called the manager over who explained that they had a new toaster and the settings only produced the results we received.  Did not apologize or try to make it right. Did agree to take the toast off the bill.   My two stars are for the waitstaff and sausage which are good."}
{"text":"I had dinner there too night with two local friends. I ordered the grilled chicken plate that came with Mac n cheese and slaw. The chicken breast had bbq sauce on it. I don't think I have ever had Mac n cheese as dry as that. It was horrible. The chicken was rubbery. The slaw ok,. My first mistake was not sending it back but my friends had recommended this restaurant and I didn't want embarrass them. My second mistake was coming to eat here....."}
{"text":"My mom, my daughter, and I visited for lunch today, and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  Alan, our waiter, was very attentive and helpful, customizing my daughter's grilled cheese so that it was to her liking.  My mom enjoyed her B.L.A.T, which includes avocado and a deep fried tomato, and I enjoyed my French Dip sandwich.  The food is a bit more pricey than I like to pay for lunch, but the service was great and it was near where we were shopping.  I would definitely return another time, maybe this time for dinner with my husband."}
{"text":"Haymaker is always a solid choice just south of desert ridge. Just had an excellent experience with a little breakfast for dinner from bell/Tatum location with the haymaker Benedict. So good!! Great service by the Man behind the bar and behind my order, Sal! A++++"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast everytime ! Its a busy place so be patient. Everything on the menu worth trying"}
{"text":"Been here three times and keep getting the same thing: Western Benedict. It is DELICIOUS. Our waitresses have always been professional and polite. Great brunch spot"}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place for a while. We LOVED it. We got a kids cheese burger, nachos, and a quesodilla. The food was DELICIOUS! will for sure be coming back!! Try to save room for Frozen Monkey next door!"}
{"text":"I came here to meet my friends for brunch. I am a big foodie and was hoping this place would be delicious. Unfortunately, this place is just okay. Nothing to get excited about. I had their belgium waffle with bananas and the waffle was not even crispy on the outside yet fluffy on the inside. The hasbrowns looked super greasy. I did enjoy our server (forgot his name). He was very patient with us and made sure our drinks where filled at all times. Sorry Haymaker, you definitely fell short."}
{"text":"When the owner, Joey, tells me that they should be putting 8oz of steak on their steak sandwich and I only see 5 pieces and its well done when I ordered it med rare...he does the right thing.  He gives me a $20 gift card.  He gives me a promise that he'd go back into the kitchen, get the staff to make sure the amount is 8 oz, and make it right the next time I come in.  He gives me a card, with his cell to let him know if they get it right.  This was last Saturday.  Well, tonight I gave his Bell establishment that 2nd chance.  I ordered the same meal.  I ordered a steak sandwich this time medium.  I was hoping his word was gold and I was going to taste redemption.  Well, as you can see by the stars, \"Eek, Me thinks not\".  The steak count is 7 pieces and the weight...3.5 oz.  (we took it to go).  And again, the steak was well done.  I call in.  I talk to the manager Austin. I let him know the situation.  He wants to make it right (again).  I pass... I'm over it.  He says the next time I come in......... but I stop him and tell him there's not going to be a next time.  I just want him to relay to Joey that it wasn't right.  We live in the neighborhood.  I was hoping this place would stick and we could dine here on a regular basis.  Well, unfortunately, we won't.  I see a lot of positive reviews.  So, I hope they do well.  This spot has turned over a handful of times.  And we need s solid restaurant in that location.  For me, it doesn't fulfill that need.  Only time will tell."}
{"text":"Really excellent breakfast place!  We ended up coming here for breakfast while my family was in town from California... we didnt want to go to some corporate owned chain or some place in Scottsdale with a 1 hour wait because of all the Spring Training nonsense.  I love the idea that its a locally owned, so I was sold.  There are a few things I really enjoy from here...  1. The service. We have AMAZING service everytime we come here, whether it be busy or slow, we are never waiting long... the servers are friendly, they refill drinks and dont judge you when you want to have a whiskey shot at 9am (hey it was our day off!).  2. The foooood... talk about massive portions. I've only been here for the breakfast, but I've been here a handful of times and never been disappointed. My favorite happens to be the Eggs Benedict with turkey avocado and egg. It reminds me of those beautiful day's in San Diego eating avocados all day.. and also, hash browns. Always hash browns.  Their breakfast sandwiches are also amazing, they come between Texas toast and you can do bacon, have, sausage or chorizo. The biggest platter they have to have here is the country fried steak and eggs. ITS MASSIVE. A must order.  3. The location, its conveniently located off of Tatum and Bell so parking is easy and convenient.  Will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Just finished our first meal at \"The Haymaker\" at 47TH Street and East Bell.  I had the Cardiologist, great burger with pastrami, and bacon.  Good service, and good food.  I would recommend the restaurant to all my friends.  We'll have to come back to try their breakfasts!!"}
{"text":"The Wrangler Burger was great as well as well as the St Louis ribs & fries. This was our 1st time. We got there at 5:00 PM on a Sat. and it was easy to get in. By 6:15 PM, they were lined up at the door, waiting to get in. They have a nice patriotic décor on the inside. Our server Christina could not have been nicer. It's a great family atmosphere. The manager Mike, stopped by and asked if everything was fine. He refilled my soda without me asking. Do not miss ordering the bread pudding. It was wonderful!! Everyone on the wait staff dressed nicely and everyone was very helpful to one another. I would highly recommend the Haymaker."}
{"text":"After a bit of a break we decided to give this place another try. I am so glad that we did! On our last two visits both the food and service have been excellent. I am totally in love with the huevos benedictos for breakfast. I could easily have this every weekend!"}
{"text":"Boring, bland, unexciting. I was looking forward to something unique on the NW side of town but unfortunately this place falls into the standard fare category. The two times I have decided to try this place (breakfast & dinner) I am left disappointed. Service, food, or otherwise, take it for my opinion only. I travel much and experience 5 star dining all the way down to Diners, Drive In's & Dives type establishments and this place holds no place in between."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for breakfast this past weekend and we were not disappointed! The food was very good and the portions were large. I would highly recommend the California omelette, and we were also impressed by the large homemade biscuits. We really enjoyed the ambiance and the patriotic decor.  The service was wonderful! The general manager stopped by to ask us about our meal and eagerly answered our questions about the history of the restaurant. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Haymaker's is a terrific bar with terrific food, which is a rare find! I have had salads, ribs, sliders and sweet potato fries- All yummy! Service is mostly good, but the variety of beers and drinks is awesome.  Great views of the sporting events all around. This is not a dive. It is a great bar with great food. When service was off, it was quickly fixed.  Go and have a great happy hour! Great food and drinks at a super deal!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed this place. Great breakfast food and great selection of beer. However, they did run out on what I wanted to try so I got the nitro beer. Enjoyed it a lot and got another. I got their most expensive egg benedict for $15 and I thought that was pretty expensive.. until it came out. The sheer size of it was MASSIVE. On top was like 6 scrambled eggs and in between was fried chicken and bacon, right below it was mashed potato along with spinach. I think the dish could have ditched the spinach and it would have tasted better."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast. Breakfast was delicious. Not sure what else there is to say? We were seated quickly, our orders were taken quickly, our food came right on time, and we left well. There was nothing exceptional in the service we were given, but it wasn't bad at the same time. Perhaps it was just an odd morning for them.  Nonetheless the food was delicious. Definitely will consider coming back."}
{"text":"I think finally we have a great family friendly bar and restaurant at Tatum and Bell.  The food was absolutely perfect.  The atmosphere was genuine and even with a bit of a Folky feel, they also have a private room for fantasy football drafts or meetings.    But the service really stands out as my favorite, thanks RJ and Micayla, you killed it, MJB"}
{"text":"First time here for breakfast, and it has now been added to our rotation of breakfast spots.  Eggs Benedict was delicious and the O'brien potatoes were perfectly cooked.  My husband had the Western Benedict and hash browns and he ate every morsel.  Really impressive food at decent prices.  I also got a salted caramel iced latte to go and it was very yummy."}
{"text":"Visited this last weekend, to test drive their happy hour menu, just to catch up with a friend. We were pleased to see that the happy hour is from 11-6.   I started with a domestic beer on tap $2 for 16oz. Not too shabby. They had house wine for $3 which was a Chardonnay, my friend got a couple of those.  For appetizers we both got fried pickles, very yummy. They give you a smoky ranch dip or ranch on request. Also we ordered pulled pork sliders. They come with 2 sliders and a good amount of pork. They were delicious, I did like there whiskey BBQ sauce.  We ended up staying for a bit and me and my BF got dinner plates. The BBQ chicken platter was a good size. Came with the mac and Cheese and veggies. All very good, chicken was moist. My boyfriend got the ribs. They were delicious! Nice and tender and saucy. That BBQ sauce is awesome. The mac is great, creamy and was nice and hot.  The speed of service was ok. We had to get our servers attention a couple of times. I think he was new cause when we came in at 4 the place was dead and he seemed a little over whelmed. As we were leaving about 6ish the place was packed for a Saturday night dinner rush.   All in all I would come back, I wasn't disappointed at all."}
{"text":"My opinion of the place has gotten worse and worse each time my family and I visit. This time we happened to stop in at 11:30, which is apparently the end of breakfast time, so we were told that after the last few breakfast plates go out our orders would go in... Mind you, we were HANDED a LUNCH menu. No big deal. We ordered and agreed to wait. Waitress was nowhere to be found, food wasn't far behind. Finally at 12:40 our daughter's Mac and Cheese shows up. The Kraft Mac and Cheese out of the box that I could have gone to the grocery store or even gas station to purchase and make on my own for $1.00, was $5.00. Then I get my fish and chips ten minutes later, which was dripping oil, not at all seasoned, and likely the most bland thing that I've tasted at any restaurant.  We received zero apology or care from our waitress, who disappeared again after our food was brought to us over an hour after ordering. It's very sad because our first visit was really a great one, but I will say now that we will not be returning to the Haymaker."}
{"text":"Loving the New management and serving team! They really transformed the place! Danielle and Alice are awesome, and they are super friendly and fast to accommodate anything we need to have a splendid meal! But the reason I come back to this place all the time is their Manager Manny. He is one of the most polite well mannered guys I know. Haymaker has a great team! I will come me here at least once a week and add them to my rotation of places to eat! Bravo guys! P. S. the A/C is super cold now! Yay!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast this morning and wasn't disappointed. Albert was attentive and helpful in recommending the Haymaker Benedict. Delicious.   It has a traditional sports bar feel in the main area but with a separate quieter dining area and a patio as well. Glad to find this gem - will be going back soon and often."}
{"text":"Lunch with my sweetie Brian Stephens! This place has been many different restaurants this is a keeper! Food and service very good?"}
{"text":"Had to wait over an hour for food.  Customers the came after us got their food and left before we got our food.  When we got the food,  the ribs were over cooked and tuff and the other people in my party had the \"Tab Sandwich\" which had way too salty bacon.  So when the manger came out to apologize he said here is a free desert card.  No money off the bill.  Why would I come back for a desert that I'll have to wait another hour for. I do not recommend this place. Poor quality food and a circus clown for a manager."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday for lunch, had to wait about 15 minutes for a table .. Waitress came and we placed our order , Texas Burger which is a burger with bacon, BBQ sauce and cheese with onion strips, my son ordered the pancakes with sausage .. 30 mins later our waitress returns to fill our water glasses and said that our food will be out in a few mins.. I noticed that the 3 tables near our table had no food either .. 12 more mins and out comes a very dry burger and undercooked pancakes ..  if a restaurant is that backed up in the kitchen, you should notify your guest and let him decide whether to stay or leave.. since this area is in the process of building more restaurants, I probably would not return and just try another establishment.."}
{"text":"Our Second time in and it was even better than the first! We started off with Happy hour beers,  just $4 for a 32oz-er and some hot wings. The wings were meaty, crispy, and the sauce was excellent (A little spice and a hint of sweet)  The kids had free meals since it was Wednesday, and this time I had the French Dip and my wife had the Pulled Pork sandwich. Both were amazing, the pulled pork was more of a fork and knife meal that a sandwich per say but the meat was smokey and delicious. The French dip had onions and mushrooms with a great au jus.   I haven't been able to make it to dessert yet but I will be back many times so I'm sure I will get there.   The service was great and the kitchen was a little slow but it is a sit down restaurant and the atmosphere is so nice we didn't mind. I'm so happy to have the haymaker so close to my home and I think this is going to be my regular place!"}
{"text":"Really nice people manage. We had a little snag with our order, but manager was very good and resolved it. The food was great."}
{"text":"In our 2-3 trips to Goodyear to be sure we were moving to the right place, this was our go-to restaurant. We even brought our family in to taste how great it was. They have great breakfast. It would have been a 5 except we had two dishes that weren't to our liking. One time we had the steak sandwich and it was AMAZING!  The second time, the steak was overdone and too Smokey.  Understanding that each steak is cooked separately, but the smoke was overwhelming.  The other meal we had that wasn't really up to par was the apple French toast. And honestly I think it was me, but the apples seemed \"watery\" with very little flavor. The French toast was amazing though, just the topping left something to be desired.   The staff is nice, attentive and polite. We will continue to come back."}
{"text":"The service was good. the ribs were amazing. the country fried steak was outstanding. the prices were fair. the only reason they did not get 5 stars from me is that the mac and cheese obviously sat for a while before I get the table. it was not hot and it was a bit stiff. did I mention the ribs were spectacular?"}
{"text":"Good place to go for family dinner.  We have also gone for date night. Food has been good, wait has never been too long and the service has been pretty good. I like the spinach salmon salad and the French dip and the wings.   Good specials and a good happy hour."}
{"text":"The food is very good but the prices don't match what you get. I have been here 4 times and left at least a little hungry each time. Side dishes are about 1 maybe 2 good bites. If that's your gig good for you but I expect a little more for my money."}
{"text":"We've eaten at the Bell location a few times, but decided that this unit was closer to our Anthem home.  We enjoyed our breakfast and our waitress was great!  My son and I are always watching what we eat and were thrilled that we could choose egg whites at no extra charge.  He enjoyed his AZ omelet, I had the senior mushroom omelet while my husband had the senior version of the all meat omelet.  our grandson loved his chocolate pancakes w/ whipped cream and chocolate milk.  But what really made his day was the BIG buffalo head that he could have his picture taken with!!!"}
{"text":"recently went back and am glad to report that the people and food were just as nice this time."}
{"text":"First time I've been here, at first impression thought this place would be really good. Unfortunately the service was less than satisfying. Our waiter Eddie didn't come greet us, I had to grab a separate waitress to grab me drinks. I was told Eddie would be right over, 10 minutes pass before I had to grab a different waitress and ask her to take our order. The waitress who got our drinks came back and said he got busy and she would take our order...too late lady, I already handled it. Can't say I would come back due to the service, disappointed as the reviews were pretty good for this place."}
{"text":"Service was good but that's about it. Good had no flavor what so ever! I had the pulled pork sandwich which was very fatty and and dry. Also had the boneless chicken and it was horrible. Friend zucchini was ok but that's about it. One star for service and another for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stopped by mid-afternoon for a quick, tasty fish-n-chips lunch and that's exactly what I got. I was in and out in 25 minutes. I like the rustic atmosphere and plan to come back to try more of their menu selections."}
{"text":"Stopped in here last Saturday (4/28/18) with my family to try them. I had an u pleasant experience at a Haymaker in Goodyear, but since my Hubby has never been to one I decided to try and give the Peoria location a shot. The experience was okay. The place was not too crowded at 630pm on a Saturday, we were seated within 5 minutes. Both my girls opted for the Kraft Macaroni and cheese. I guess I can't expect much when it tells you right on the menu you are getting Mac an cheese that I could have made at home, but they were happy with it. I was REALLY glad they brought the girls food out before ours because they were pretty hungry and the more they wait the \"hangrier\" they got. As for my dish, I opted to try the Huevos Rancheros with chorizo. I was good and filling. It lacked seasoning (everything felt very bland - like I HAD to add on hot sauce to make it flavorful.) It was also on the pretty greasy side, but that was probably my fault for adding chorizo - I guess I just expected them to drain off the excess grease and not add it to the bottom of the plate. As for my hubby he got the cardiologist. With a name like that you would expect it to be mouth watering artery clogging good. It was decent (I tried a bite too), but it too was sorely lacking in the seasoning department. I almost felt like the chefs were being instructed to make everything bland on purpose or that they ran out of seasoning. For the prices I expect more. We may or may not be back, especially given the other options in the area that have more \"not from the box\" food options and ones that are seasoned."}
{"text":"The food was good. A bit on the greasy side. I needed extra napkins to wipe up the grease on my hands. The wait for a table was pretty long. At lunch on a Wednesday we had to wait over 20 minutes for a table. Then to pour more salt in the open wound it took over 30 minutes for our food to come out. The only good thing was the fact they had a lunch menu and one of the sides \"frings\" is a half order of fries and onion rings. I am not sure if I will come back or not. If I do I will probably try the breakfast since the Texan Burger I got was SO greasy."}
{"text":"Out of towners looking for a good local breakfast spot. Our resort recommended the Haymaker for breakfast. When we arrived is was bustling with customers and I took that as a good sign. We were promptly seated even though it was busy, which was nice.  They have a hearty breakfast menu and you can expect hearty portions. Since my husband and I don't eat pork I was pleasantly surprised that they offered a turkey sausage meat option.  I ordered their apple cinnamon French toast and my husband had their banana pecan pancakes. Both were on point but the portion size is a lot more than what I'm used to.  We had leftovers.  Service was great. Never had to ask for a coffee refill. The servers were on top of it. A nice bonus  is we received 20 percent discount on our bill because we were staying at the Cibola resort.   We're gonna go back once more before our vaca is over."}
{"text":"Waited for awhile before someone acknowledged we had come in and seat us. Service was slow. Food was good. The menu is served all day so you want a hamburger for breakfast go for it.  Lot to choose from on the menu."}
{"text":"Went to the Haymaker for the first time.   The restaurant is nice and clean and the staff is very friendly.   The wait was about 20 minutes which isn't bad.   The reason I give it 3 stars is that lunch isn't available on Sunday morning until 11:30 am.  The waiter took a while to take our order so the manager came to take the order but she wrote it on her hand and my wife thinks that's not very professional.  The breakfast food we ordered was good.  I had the pigs in a blanket and a side of potatoes obrien and my wife had a breakfast burrito and a pancake.  I think they should have some lunch items available especially on Sunday morning when some people may want more of a brunch item.  But overall the food was good."}
{"text":"Had the short stack of pancakes. Don't see how anyone needs anymore than that. They're huge, fluffy and delicious. I will definitely go back. Only thing to make it better is if they had the good thick bacon.  Alot of places serve huge portions to make up for the lack luster food. This is not one of those places. It was super delicious... even the next day."}
{"text":"Love this place. Good to watch s game. Good drink & lunch specials, good for families too.  I love the grown up grilled cheese & broccoli/cheese soup. I'm addicted. Haha   I love the American history theme inside too.  Check it out."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for dinner the other night and had a great time.  We ordered the Ribs, Strawberry Spinach Salad and the Chicken Fingers Kids Meal.  All dishes were tasty and the service was fast.  Also, their Moscow Mules were amazing, great ginger beer and just the right amount of lime.  Definitely will be back for another meal while we are staying at the hotel down the street.  PS: Bonus points if you can solve the fish puzzle on the Kids menu."}
{"text":"We appreciate the owner contacting us after our first bad experience and asking for a second chance. Unfortunately the second time around was worse. Not going to bash the place to death with details. A lot of people like the restaurant...it just wasn't meant to be for us. Service gets an A...food gets an F again."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant.  Food was excellent.  Had the Texan Burger was so yummy. Our server Amand was so attentive and friendly . Just a really nice lunch. If you go there ask for Amanda ."}
{"text":"My family and I went here yesterday for a late lunch. It was around 245pm and with hardly anyone inside we thought it would be an in-and-out kind of experience. We asked our server what the place was known for, and she replied 'burgers.' We ordered drinks and it took roughly 15 minutes to get. The drinks came out wrong and with melted ice. My father then asked the server what size were the burgers. She said she didn't know and that they were about 'medium size.'  What?! She left to go ask the kitchen and returned 5 minutes later. At this point, we are starving and thirsty for cold drinks.  We start to order, my father tries to place his order and our server tells him that she needs to go 'in order' and she'll get to him. Clearly this woman has never waited tables before.  When the food finally came, it was 352pm and was not remotely worth the headache. There is quite a bit more regarding delays, no refills, etc but I think you get the gist.   This establishment has the potential but clearly needs to focus on its staff and work on training a bit more.  I wouldn't visit this establishment again."}
{"text":"A great place for gluten free people. They have gluten free buns and bread and the french fries are gluten free. A welcome addition to places to eat. Prices are a little on the high side. They need more coupons and specials. Very busy and noisy because there just aren't enough restaurants in area. Only have been one time looking forward to going and checking out some more of the menu"}
{"text":"Great for breakfast, sports, or drinks. I had their great huevos rancheros - chorizo, eggs, and avocado over potatoes and beans, and my family members around me all enjoyed their breakfasts as well.  I wanted to try 3-4 other items on the menu, including the breakfast sandwich, Haymaker's Benedict, and apple french toast - now my mouth's watering.  The next time I had a Patty Melt for lunch, with their fries - a little underwhelming, but still tasty, just not jump-off-the-page tasty, and the cajun fries a little light on seasoning - but the French Dip and Huevos Bendictos impressed me from across the table - solid choices, quite a few creative takes.  Also, they had a really handy stand for my baby's carrier/car seat (pictured) - perfect for infants who can't sit in a high chair yet.  This is a really nice touch, and it made our breakfast very chill and enjoyable. Whoever sells high chairs, sell these too so it's like a package deal and every restaurant has both!"}
{"text":"The first thing you see is a big American Flag and the Pledge of Allegiance proudly displayed in the entrance. Second, you're guaranteed a genuinely cheerful greeting.   Although the extensive menu is primarily basic American comfort fare, each menu  item has a delicious creative twist. Top this off with a great beer selection and over 120 whiskey brands, and you've got a place that brings you back time and time again!   This is my fourth visit, and the quality is consistently top-notch.   In line with their obvious love of Country, they support our brave warriors with a military discount."}
{"text":"Food was awful. The service was great the time I was here. I wasn't happy with the food, and I tried a bit of everything from the 4 of us that ordered. There are cloth napkins like they are trying to be fancy but yet they serve some of the food in paper boats."}
{"text":"Great family place, reasonable prices, large menu. They have a great selection of whiskeys and bourbons, good selection of craft beers. My husband and I shared the full rack of ribs which fell off the bone and the bbq sauce was sweet but the portion was small and I'd have to say I've had better but they were good. Mac and Cheese came on the side and it was also good with just the right amount of crispy panco on top. My mother had the french dip and she loved it, very lean meat with sauteed onions and mushrooms, great soft bread. Hamburgers are large and the blackened catfish was very good. The thing on the menu had to be the bread pudding; excellent! Our server, Jennifer was great, good sense of humor and made our fining experience fun."}
{"text":"There only getting two stars for their great OJ. We came straight after church and they didn't seem prepared for the Sunday crowd. After waiting 35min we go seated and promptly was greeted and served OJ. From there we waited another 15min to order than another 20min or more for food the service was horrible not enough forks looking everywhere from server. They brought one wrong meal and gave my hubby bacon instead of sausage. Food was mediocre. Disappointed cause I thought we found another restaurant we won't be back"}
{"text":"Hallie Grisham was amazing and the food was awesome!!  Such a great experience!  Neighborhood restaurant with a great ambience!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious. ... Haymaker Hollandaise thing was awesome!  The bread pudding was yummy.. my friend got the California omelette and she thought it was great also... Great service... I plan on coming back for sure.."}
{"text":"We have been here many times and every time it's always great service! Food is delicious staff is always nice!! I would love to see one closer to the buckeye area, it's def worth the drive but wouldn't mind one a little closer!"}
{"text":"Good food. Good sized portions for the price.  Lots of beer choice on tap. Great wait staff.  Fresh fried pickles. Ali was very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"I ordered a haymaker salad (large) with added chicken. It was bland. For a simple salad, the portion was really small, just lettuce and tomatoes and onions, wasn't expecting anything spectacular but thought at least the volume would make up for the price. Sadly disappointed. To top it off (pun intended), the chicken was really, really dry. The waiter didn't know how many ounces of chicken would be added on the salad, estimated 5 oz, didn't check back with the kitchen like any good waiter would do, and when it came out, being a bikini competitor, I would have estimated it to be 3-4 oz.   I would not recommend this place. For the location, there are way better options in the area."}
{"text":"awesome food i went there with my gf and was a great experience. Was a mixture of bbq and casual food. Great quality and friendly waiter couldnt ask for more happy ate dinner hear would recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"We were a little hesitant to even try this place due to the many warnings of mediocre food and poor service. But, it was close and we were thirsty and hungry so...  I agree that this is a nice looking, clean place. It would probably be great to watch a game. The country twang was turned up a little high for me but I can't knock them for that. If it was gameday, I'm sure I would be happy.  Our server was new and did a decent job. Never let our beer glasses go empty. However, I must agree with many others regarding said beer glasses: do not use Mason jars, and especially WARM Mason jars to serve your beer! I get that they are trying for a theme of sorts and they are OK for mixed drinks, but the stupid jars don't work for beer. I couldn't even drink my first one for over 10 minutes because of the massive amount of head on the beer from the jar. By the time it calmed down, it was warm.   On to the food. My friend ordered the Buffalo Chicken sandwich. The chicken was soggy and almost room temp. We think they used sauce straight out of the fridge which cooled the chicken and made it a mess. The bread was barely toasted and got super soggy quickly. I had a burger and asked for it to be medium rare. It was almost raw and was supposed to have avocado on it. It had less than a teaspoon of storebought guacagoo on it. I know because I scraped it off. We pointed this out to our new server and he just laughed. Not funny. Asked for the manager and she never came. Finished our beers, sent both plates over 2/3 full back, paid our bills and said goodbye to The Haymaker. Two stars because the fries were good."}
{"text":"Food was good, a little confusion on the service side.  Waitress was new so she's learning!  The manager, on the other hand,  wasn't as helpful as the waitress.  My companion ordered a Margarita and unbeknownst to us (and another customer) the Sunday night $4 special is not the Happy Hour Margarita.  It was Sunday night and the bill charged us $6 for the Margarita.  My companion questioned that, as did the other customer.  I don't know how they made out but no correction made to our tab.  Now,  it seems that $2 would not be a high price to pay for customer satisfaction, but it was too steep of a price to pay for the manager on duty that night.  So, even though the food was good, I won't be spending any more of my money here and will share the experience with my friends.  There are plenty of alternatives in the area."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times now having hit up breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The staff has been wonderful each and every time. Which, to me, is as important as the food. Also a great place to catch a game. Lots of TV's. This visit I brought my kids, and they e joyed their experience. Price was decent and I felt was a good value for the service and quality of the food. My only complaint, which is mild really, is that the Primavera Pasta I ordered came out looking more like a soup than a pasta. They brought 2 bowls, luckily, since I had to pour out a bunch of the sauce. But as far as flavor, I was so pleased. Their cream/credo sauce actually had flavor!!!! Which is rare in my restaurant experiences. Usually I need to add salt to get some kind of flavor. Food has always been good, and service exceptional. I like this joint!"}
{"text":"Update to 5 stars. Was contacted by the manager who assured me they resolved my issue."}
{"text":"Thanks to the hospitality of Joey L. Our family tried Haymakers again. Much better experience. We tried breakfast instead of lunch and I was right with my decision. Our waitress was extremely nice and helpful. The manager ( I assume ) was very good. Kitchen staff may need to pay a little more attention because they put ham instead of bacon on my wife's omelet. The mistake was fixed immediately by our waitress and management which I really appreciate. Thank you Joey L."}
{"text":"I am updating my review because the food we had this time was much better.  Although we only had appetizers and beer it was good.  We had the fried pickles that were delicious but I would rather have ranch with my pickles instead of 1000 island dressing.  Next the sliders were just ok, husband and I both said we could go without those next time.  Then the last thing was the boneless wings that were amazing!  The sauce we got l, I forget what it was called, but it was a spicy BBQ, so good!  The waiter, Marshall, was friendly and prompt.  He did get busy at the end but overall good service."}
{"text":"Jacob was dope! Had him as a bartender tonight and not only great service but great suggestions on beer as well. First time there and will definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"I've been here for breakfast quite a few times.  I love it. I always sneak a few bites of my daughter's chocolate chip pancakes. The bloody Mary's and screwdrivers are on point and the huevks rancheros and eggs Benedict have never disappointed me. This has quickly become my favorite breakfast place."}
{"text":"Food was blah and nothing special.  Had a salad and my wife had soup. Burgers going by to the next table looked better though.  Service was bad too. Had to ask for everything,  more water,  the check,  etc.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"A real gem! Fantastic (huge) menu with great choices. We tried the Peoria location & will definitely return. We experienced friendly and prompt service, not waiting long for our food at all (at lunchtime, mid-week). Nice ambiance (don't let the outside fool you), with a country feel.  Ordered the BLAT (BLT w/Avocado & deep-fried tomato) - wonderful!! Both Kid's Menu & Senior serving size prices, too. A great find!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Been twice now and my husband and I both enjoyed the atmosphere and food."}
{"text":"It's about time the west side finally got a restaurant worth going to for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Great staff, great food, great bar.  This place has a bright future for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"First time visiting. Great place: friendly hostess, accommodating wait staff, patriotic decor, clean dining area, flavorful food. Our waiter Jonathan was very friendly, professional, and helpful. The military discount was an added bonus.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I had the Texan burger and my wife had the French dip. Both were absolutely delicious.   We each had a beer on happy hour, both were great and really cold.  Service was awesome and really polished.   I was really excited for this place to open and was not disappointed!  Great food in a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I should have known that my experience would be bad from the moment I entered the restaurant. The hostess didn't acknowledge me but continued to talk to the patrons in the bar. I waited to check in until someone else came up. Next, just to order the food took at least 15 minutes before the waiter came back to our table. Once we received our food he never asked us if we needed anything else. I literally had to walk to kitchen to ask for some mayo to go with my hamburger I ordered."}
{"text":"We have lived near this place for years and have never checked it out. Recently went in with friends and loved it! We've already been back two other times! Drinks and food are both delicious! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"When you first walk into The Haymaker, you are greeted with a mix of urban and small town Americana decor that perfectly suits the place. The staff, from the hostess to the management are friendly and accomodating.   Make friends with the bartender and get your iced salted caramel latte blended if they aren't busy. For breakfast, it's wise to get there early as they stop serving their amazing biscuits and gravy at 11:30 am on weekends.   The menu is decent sized and offers a great selection for breakfast lunch and dinner. Be sure when you visit to try the burger of the month.   And, if you happen to be sitting in the bar on any given day, listen for the faint sound of a cowbell in the background. Then if you are brave enough, ask your server about it."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time tonight with my son. Had wings and fried pickles for starters. Excellent and the sweet chili sauce on the wings was great.  Dinner was a patti melt and buffalo chicken sandwich. It's easy to screw up a patti melt but they got it right. The chicken sandwich was very good too.  Service was very good. Prices reasonable and food very good. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Heard great things about this chain so we decided to grab lunch here on a Wednesday around 1:30 pm, not busy as all. We were seated in the bar area right away. Ordered a salad and fries and arnold palmers. Pretty simple. Drinks eventually arrived about ten minutes later and a good 20 min later our food came out. I found it odd for fries and a salad to take 30 min to prepare since the restaurant wasn't busy. I do understand that this location just opened and it takes a couple weeks for all the staff to get in sync with each other and kitchen staff. The woman at the bar came and took our empty drinks and offered refills and we never got them back. When our waiter came to ask how everything was and if we needed anything, I mentioned I never got my drink back. He didn't apologize, just said ok and brought another refill back.   The food was decent, nothing that can't be found at a similar restaurant /bar style place, staff just needs to work on routine and probably empathy."}
{"text":"First time at Haymaker. I ordered the fish and chips, 2 pieces of cod, beer battered,fries and slaw. Mind you, I ordered from the seniors menu. The non senior you get 3 pieces of fish. It was all good, nice atmosphere also. I will definitely be back to try the rest of their menu! Service was great!"}
{"text":"Did not start off well with the receptionist telling us the restaurant bar was closing in 20 minutes while the dining area was fine.  Kind of did not sit well with me  Had the Blackened Salmon, Chicken Fried Steak and Pastrami Sandwich. All our food was prepared well and tasted very good.  Can back again a few weeks later on a Thursday on $7 Burger Night, unfortunately the Cardiologist Burger is not included, but theTexan Burger is.  The Cardiologist Burger is one if the better burgers I have had in a long time, this burger includes the burger, pastrami and bacon on a pretzel bun. Pretty much all my favorites.   Third time in 3 weeks, this time ordered the following entrees- Blackened Catfish with Wild Rice and Ceasar Lettuce Wrap Pastrami with Mac and Cheese. All again were excellent.   Tip is to get their Groupon and save some $ !  Want to try there breakfast sometime.  Starting to really like this place and you know I will be back."}
{"text":"Good honest place to eat.  The staff are great, professional and personable.  The food is really good American fare.  Prices are great;  best price mimosa in the world.  The place is clean, which is major for me. The bar is well stocked and the bartenders knowledgeable.  Why do I keep coming back?  I love the American patriotism and family culture.  They are the real deal when it comes to treating you like friends and family.  I have lived all over the country in some pretty cosmopolitan cities.  I am a foodie.  I hate routines because I like variety and get bored easy...however I find myself back here every Saturday morning for breakfast.  I love the food, the people, and the Americana culture."}
{"text":"Location: the restaurant is very well decorated and the atmosphere is very relaxing.   Service: the hostesses were super friendly, but our waitress was just ok. I wish she could have asked us if we need refill for water and coffee. As soon as the bill was paid, she never stop by at all.   Food: It was just ok.   Review: I will stop by again if I am in the area"}
{"text":"Been here over a dozen (12) times. The last 3 times have been pretty bad. Seems they have an issue in the kitchen. Hope they can find a better kitchen crew before they go out of business. They try making up with giving out gift certificates but all we really want is a great dining experience. Hope they can find a better Exec.Chef to improve the place."}
{"text":"Food is really good. The service is very slow. We have been here an hour and a half for lunch. Stills waiting for our check. If your pressed for time go somewhere else."}
{"text":"FAITH RESTORED! Shortly after I posted my last review of The Haymaker on Lake Pleasant, I received a response from Kelly who is the Manager there. She apologized for my dining experience and advised me that she had spoken to the servers and looked to reinforce their training procedures. For my part, I promised Kelly to give The Haymaker another visit. I am glad I did! Clearly Kelly was true to her word. I stopped by The Haymaker this morning for breakfast and followed the same routine as on my previous visit. This time all the service failures previously experienced were corrected. There were menus at the open seat at the bar (no need to ask/wait for one) and I was promptly greeted by server extraordinaire, Paige. My drink and food orders were taken on a timely basis and I never once got the feeling that I was not important. When I mentioned during my breakfast order that I wanted coffee, Paige immediately asked, \"And cream?\" (Why, yes please!) And when Paige returned with the coffee and cream, she also brought that much needed utensil...a spoon. HOME RUN! Paige fired on all cylinders while I was there...not just with me, but with the other customers she was serving. Thanks Kelly and Paige.  Now one situation that I witnessed while there that I also wanted to share that further illustrates The Haymaker's service dealt with a customer who was not happy with the way his hash browns were prepared. In his estimation, they were cold and not crispy enough. He brought the concern to Paige's attention and Paige apologized to the customer and promised to get it taken care of. Paige, in turn, brought it to (recently promoted) Manager Glen's attention. Glen takes the food away to have it re-prepared. Glen returns the item to the customer again offering an apology. The customer then calls Glen over again saying they still aren't right. Glen listens dutifully and says he will replace them. While they are being prepared again, the customer approaches Glen with some additional comments. Eventually, Glen takes the customer back in to the kitchen to show him how his potatoes are prepared. The customer and Glen emerge several minutes later...customer smiling. Glen then prepares the customer's bill and takes it to their table. Glen then squats down so that he is eye level with the seated customer. They continue to talk and Glen introduces himself to the customer's dining partner. They continue chatting a bit. Glen then leaves and Paige stops by to apologize again also. Clearly the customer felt heard and appreciated. Way to go, Glen! It's obvious the recent promotion was well deserved.  Service failures are part of the business. How a business responds to them is the key as to how well they are going to do and how much they deserve OUR business. Clearly The Haymaker knows this and works hard to make each diner's experience pleasant and worthy of a repeat visit. Thanks Kelly, Paige and Glen for restoring my faith in The Haymaker on Lake Pleasant. I look forward to my next visit.  Knife (Written by Knife of Knife N Fork.
