{"text":"Amazing place with great owners. Extremely friendly and make you feel at home. Its a family run restaurant that provide extremely high quality, authentic south Indian food at a very very reasonable price. Our all time favorites are masala dosa, obattu, filter coffee, paddu, mint rice, and gulab jamun. This week was our 5th visit to this place and we will be coming here for more very soon."}
{"text":"Very bad food....idli's were scooped out and placed upside down, Sambhar burns your food pipe....gives either Sambhar ( extra hot) or chutney( some times sweet). I have tried his food couple of times..He always disappoints big time. Save yourself the trouble of going to him."}
{"text":"I took out idli and onion dosa. It was nice amd warm even after 45 minutes. Tasty and at $10
What more to ask for. I recommend this for south indian food"}
{"text":"We have been frequent visitors to South India Cuisine take-out restaurant. It is a family owned business run by husband and wife and the owners are really very friendly people. We have tried most of their food, including bisi beli bath, idlis, aloo bhonda, tomato rice, etc. The food is cooked homestyle and is very delicious. The owner tries his best to customize the food to your specific needs. I like the fact that for most orders, the food is freshly prepared and when you call them ahead of time, they will be sure to have your order eady when you arrive. Overall, in my opinion, they have the best South Indian food in the area."}
{"text":"A vegetarian oasis in a fast food desert! 

Hands down the best place on Mayfield Road for quality Indian cuisine at a great value. Everything is made from scratch, they have a fantastic and authentic selection of Indian desserts, beverages, snacks, as well as an extensive menu. Everything is cooked in house. 

I don't know who this 'T. S.' character is but the karmic impact of a rude and scathing review like that will sort itself out in time. 

BEST VEGETARIAN FOOD ON MAYFIELD ROAD 

My go to lunch spot!

{"text":"Very good South Indian vegetarian food with a good variety of dishes. I go to this place regularly and they have some new dishes in the menu every now and then and some seasonal Indian snacks in addition. It is an inexpensive place with freshly made food and a single table with few chairs but mostly food to take away. The single table is a self clean area and they don't charge like restaurant . Family run business, nice friendly people."}
{"text":"Good and Fresh Home cooked Food for very decent prices....Definitely recommend visiting if you're vegetarian."}
{"text":"Not fancy, but wonderful food and very friendly owners who explained all of the dishes. Great flavor and made to order."}
{"text":"This place has great south indian cuisine! The food is fresh and authentic. We are a big fan of their paddus."}
{"text":"Small take away indian Deli with authentic south indian vegetarian food. Sambhar is very good, owner has good sense of humor too"}
{"text":"Excellent South Indian vegetarian cuisine!  The owner Satish and his wife make delicious food and are very friendly.  I have done takeout and also a weekly orders from here for family and they have made the food healthier for us (less salt, mild, etc).  There is limited seating so i generally do take out but occasionally will have a dhosa there if im in a hurry.  The food I have received has been made fresh while I wait or if I call ahead for a weekly order with a future date and time pickup the order has always been ready at that time and correct ready for me to pickup.   Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Fresh, homemade delicious food with rather generous portions... Only cons: Wait times are a bit long because they are a small place with what seems like a couple of cooks at most. Probably best to call in advance and order- also, there's not much room in there... To sum up, the owners are wonderfully friendly and the food is great- what more can be asked? :)"}
{"text":"Had the vegetable curry spinach with paneer, thinner (watery) than I expected.  Would have liked more substance.  Flavor was okay, did not excite my taste buds.  People are nice tho.
One thing I didn't know was that their take out food may be pre-made and refrigerated- found out when I was asked if I wanted the saag heated up.  Kind of deflated my expectations before I even left the restaurant."}
{"text":"I am extremely surprised at the great reviews this place has received. I went there once, this was my experience...

a) Place looked a mess (discarded garden-sale furniture), misspelled signs, harassed looking woman (quite a nice temperament however) took my order.  Ordered pretty standard stuff (Masala Dosa and Idli chutney and a sweet dish).

b) There was a large table with a few plastic chairs around it. I sat there and played with my iPad. 

c) The son(?) brought the food over. The son seemed nice (quiet).  The food was on a pretty horrible paper plate and very cheap plastic utensils. (I sort of did not expect that given that these people had a table and chairs there). And the food was not cheap to start with.

d) I originate from (and spent many years in) the place where Masala dosas and idlis originate (Udupi, Karnataka, India). And I can tell you that the food was mediocre at best. The idlis seemed badly made (broke up) and the Masala Dosa had a weird off-white color. In all fairness, the taste, while not great, was not too bad.

e) While eating, the male owner came in. He picked up my order receipt (which was on the counter) and called out \"who is this order for (my name)?\".
I thought... I'm the only guy in the restaurant, who else could it be?
I called out and said \"it's mine\"

f) Finished my meal. Went to the counter to collect the sweet I had ordered. Asked for it. This guy goes running back to the kitchen and asks in Kannada (the local language) \"Has he already taken the sweets?\"
Did this guy really think I was out to steal a packet of sweets???

Upon confirming that I did not indeed take the sweets, he hands me a packet.

g) The bill was for $17. I gave him $20 and said \"keep the change\".

And here is the kicker...
The owner said \"Thanks\" and a second later he said \"You can use the trashcan\"

I turned around surprised and asked \"for what\". 

He said \"For your plate\"

(Like in any restaurant, I had left the plate on the table)

I got really mad, took the plate, chucked it into the trashcan and went to him and said \"Gimme my change\" (which he did)

I did not mean to write a bad review because people's livelihoods depend on these reviews (just planned to forget the whole nasty incident). But I had a terrible stomach ache later. Most likely caused by the sweets.

It is a pity that poor lady slogs away in the kitchen while her husband could not bother to literally take 2 steps and chuck a plate into the trash *after* receiving a $3 tip on a $17 order.

All told a nasty experience :("}
{"text":"They have authentic food items and really tastes good..its a family owned cuisine and their customer service is good and they have more varieties..i love it.."}
{"text":"We ordered quite a lot of things 
1. Masala dosa - simply amazing with ghee
2. Vada sambhar - good 
3. Idli sambar n chutney - nice with amazing sambhar and chutney.
Menu looks good felt like trying everything but will be there again."}
{"text":"First time ordering here this past Saturday. The owner was very nice and explained dishes to us without seeming annoyed with my 20 questions. I appreciated that he asked if we wanted our food \"American\" spicy or \"Indian\" spicy.  After not believing we could handle the heat of Indian spicy, he brought us a small sample to see if that was tolerable. We settled on the lemon noodle dish (I'd give that more than 5 stars if I could), lemon rice (solid 4 stars) and Paddu (10 stars!!) I would recommend ordering ahead as our food took about 30 minutes to come out. Each dish is prepared fresh to order (nothing is pre-made). I really enjoyed my food and would recommend without hesitation."}
{"text":"WOW! You know a place has great food when you come for lunch and end up coming back for dinner....the same day. 

I grew up in Flushing, Queens- home of the Indians and can speak to legit South Indian food. This is better than what I've had in Queens and Manhattan. The owners/cooks/husband-wife combo are very nice and the husband is hilarious. We are from out of town but have made it a point to come here whenever in the area.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Very tasty food. The onion dosa and biryani were great and the bisibele bath was very good. Each dish was prepared fresh. Owner was very friendly, explained the flavors of the food for people newer to south Indian cuisine, like myself. We ended up ordering 4 different appetizers/dishes and 2 drinks for only $22. 

Cons: It's located in a strip mall off of Mayfield Rd and was a little hard to spot. Also, it's pretty much take out only, though they have one table set up."}
