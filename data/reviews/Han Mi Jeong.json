{"text":"Would give this a 4.5 if possible.

Fantastic new addition to the Richmond Hill food scene. The restaurant interior is comparable to most Korean restaurants, with your standard \"help yourself\" utensils, and clean decor, chairs and tables. Lots of parking, with the restaurant being located in Richlane Mall.

The menu features your standard Korean staples including various soups, noodle soups, Chinese fusion,  and BBQ dishes. Overall, prices are a little higher than average (appx $1-2), but the quality of the food makes up for it. 

We ordered the \"Kalbi BBQ combo\" (comes with a Seafood Tofu Soup), which was way more than enough for two people. The meal came with 6 standard appetizers (two kimchis, glass noodles, seaweed, radish) which were very tasty and gladly refilled when asked. The kalbi ribs came partially cooked, along with the BBQ grill for us to finish the grilling to our liking. The ribs were tender and well marinated and tasted fantastic after a few minutes on the grill. Purple rice and lettuce wraps were provided to complement the dish.  

Came back a few weeks later, and tried the Kampoongi (Sweet and Spicy Chicken), which was fantastic, and came with just the right amount of sauce so that the breaded pieces were still crispy when they arrived."}
{"text":"I'll be say this is my favourite Korean restaurant. It is kinda hidden since it is located in a small mall called Richlane Mall. Kimchi Rice, Pork Bone Soup and Pork Belly are my personal favourite."}
{"text":"I can across this korean restaurant by chance since it's near my work. To me and my korean friends surprised the food was top quality ingredients, a great price and delicious. The portions are also huge. We love the Kim chi fried rice, dumplings on a cold day and they even have the combo table top combos. A tip go early to miss the noon hr rush and the dinner rush (7pm). If not you'll be waiting outside in a line!"}
{"text":"Environment looks clean, however, the tongs that they gave us is very dirty. Taste is okay but I think many other Korean restaurants can make better taste than this one. I would prefer Lee Nam Jang over this one."}
{"text":"Nice to see a Korean place open up around this area since there aren't too many otherwise (unless you go to Yonge+Finch). Their staff are friendly and polite. Their banchan were all really good!! I would have asked for so much more if only I had more room in my stomache. I had the seafood soft tofu soup which was delicious too & nice plentiful amount of seafood in it. Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Nice clean restaurant, very compact, need to wait if you come at the peak hour. Food is tasty, but not too much special."}
{"text":"Ordered pork bone soup, tofu (with seafood) soup, spicy seafood noodle soup, seafood pancake and a plate of spicy ramen with rice cake.

The soups were definitely the highlights (especially the pork bone soup) and the noodles were very chewy. The sauce in the spicy ramen and rice cake was spicy and sweet, although quite salty too.

Overall, the items were tasty and we all enjoyed our orders."}
{"text":"Good menu selection, but mostly soups which I love! Food was very good and served fast. We were there at lunch time and it wasn't overly busy."}
{"text":"I like their Jampong, seafood noodle soup. 
Would like to explore other dishes on my next visit. This restaurant can stop my sudden craving of Korean food driving all the way to Young n finch."}
{"text":"We arrived around 7pm on a Sunday and business was steady, not too busy. We ordered their pork belly table bbq with pork bone soup (which was good but too much meat by the end of the meal). The pork belly was good and no visible freezer burn like some of the other places I've been to. The servers came by frequently and helped us cook the meat but didn't offer any sort of side dish refills. The side dish selection and taste were kind of subpar imo as someone else previously mentioned but it didn't bother me too much. I love purple rice so that's a huge plus for me. The price is 39.99 for an order which makes sense cause of the ingredient heavy soups that are included as options. Next time around I'll probably opt for the seafood soon tofu soup if I'm already eating pork belly. I mentioned earlier that they did the cooking just as most places do but I'm not a fan of this practice cause there's raw meat and cooked meat cross contamination and when everything is getting cooked faster than I can eat/wrap my wraps they start getting too crispy/burnt for my liking!!! I also turn down the heat of the BBQ cause I don't like my pork belly too crispy but the ladies turn it right back up. Minor pet peeve and my own personal preference. Overall good meal and good ventilation as the ceilings are high w fans and an open door. I didn't like sitting near the door but there was only a six person table available at this time."}
{"text":"Nice and quiet spot, some items were a little pricier than the other Korean places I've been to but the quality is well worth it. I had the cold noodles and it was one of the best ones I've had. It came with tons of pears and apples and the noodles weren't super spongy or hard to chew. The picture I took of the noodles was after everything was cut up. Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"I've been here for a few times and I love it. This place is wide, tidy, clean and comfy. Services are pretty nice and fast. Prices are fair and their food is delicious. But they don't have that much dishes, they only have the simple dishes and nothing else which I'm a little disappointed."}
{"text":"For being in a supposedly \"cursed\" and \"haunted\" mall, this place is pretty alright! If I could, I'd give this place a strong 3.75 stars. You get your usual Korean fare: your bibimbap, your kamjatang, your kimchi jigae, etc. But two things stood out to me: the purple rice and the prevalence of zucchini. It's a strange thing to notice but I love zucchini and was SO HAPPY to see it in banchan form and in my dolsot bibimbap. Speaking of the banchan, it was plentiful and tasted fresh.

Everything here tastes pretty clean. By this I mean little MSG and oil. And also that it won't come back later in the form of you sitting in the bathroom for hours with Reddit as your only friend. You know what I mean. My brother was not impressed with the omu-rice (omelette rice) as it was merely plopped on top of the rice and not wrapped around it. But honestly, you don't go to a Korean restaurant for that.

Anyhow, my mother was saying how it's about time we got a decent Korean restaurant up in Richmond Hill. Now we don't have to make the trek down to Yonge and Finch! Service was polite and we went on a busy night so it was obviously a bit slow. What felt different was the quality of the food. They don't skimp and use stingy cuts of meat like the Owl on Major Mac and Bayview. Plus you'll feel like you're doing your body a favour by eating some of that yummy and healthy purple rice!"}
{"text":"4.5 
They have purple rice!! 
We chose not to dine in, instead we ordered there and brought the food back home. 
It can be pretty fast if you choose to take-out. 
The food there generally tastes really nice."}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars because I have been coming here to fullfil my Korean food cravings, and it has never disappointed. It's nice to have a restaurant where Koreans are actually the ones making and serving the food (i.e. lots of places where it's actually Chinese people who are the ones making sushi or pad thai or Korean food)..  The family meals are very reasonably priced for the amount of food you get, and I like how they give you the option to have seafood pancake or jap chae or the pork bone soup so you can try the different stuff for your next visits. 
Their banchan and the rice they serve and the tea are also very authentic Korean.

Only negative is the place can get really busy during peak hours, and it can get very hot inside when multiple tables are grilling or boiling pots of soup. I would also say thumbs up to the ladies in the red shirts serving everyone and running around with the carts. They manage to keep the tables and everything very clean (cleaner then the other restaurants at that strip mall)."}
{"text":"Only korean restaurant in the Richlane plaza. Always busy and serving up sizzing hot korean dishes.

I find lots of Korean restaurants serve up similar selections. I like their kimchi here - it is more mild compared to other restaurats. Good sidedish spread with unlimited refills. The quality of their food has always been consistent.

Haven't tried tabletop bbq but I ordered the grilled mackerel set which came with 2 pieces of fish on a sizzling plate and a bowl of purple rice.

Nothing terribly unique at this location. A good place to grab korean food if you live in the Leslie / 16th area.

Come early for less lineup."}
{"text":"EXcellent food and service. Except pity pricy for seafood pancake...sweet and sour pork don't have small portion."}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!

I walked in to ask to be seated and was given a questioning look from one of the waitresses, a look around the seating area and then a SHRUG?!?!?!?

I Just turned and walked right away....

DON'T BOTHER COMING HERE"}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner as it is usually quite packed on the weekend. 

Quality is consistent here and service is good.  We ordered the cold noodle and a seafood tofu soup.  

Cold noodle portion was huge! It comes with radish, apple, cucumber, and 3 slices of beef.  They also provide vinegar and horseradish sause for additional seasoning.  A bit much for 1 person so I'd suggest you order this to share.  Noodles are thin and chewy and comes in iced broth.

Seafood soon tofu soup was good but expect mainly calamari rings, 1 clam, 1 mussle.  There was no shrimp.  Overall still tasty.  The rice doesn't come in a stone pot like some other places though.

Lots of sidedishes including kimchee, japchae, brocolli, beans, apple slices, and tofu.  Brocolli as a korean sude dish was kind of odd, suggest they replace this with beansprouts instead.

The tabletop cooking next to us looked really good as well and I'd like to try it next time."}
{"text":"Went with husband on a Friday night around eight, took us slightly less than 10mins wait for a table. Not bad for a Friday night.

Love the food! Everything had its own flavour and quite tasty! Looking forward to next visit!"}
{"text":"Food is okay. Side dishes are on the weaker side. 
The yook gae jang soup and kkang poongi aren't bad. My boyfriend also enjoys the pork bone soup. 
Don't get the cold noodles. Not good at all. 

Parking is a nightmare in this plaza on Saturdays and Sunday's. Beware!! I've parked at the eggsmart plaza down Leslie because it's so bad. 

Service isn't bad. when they see that you are low on side dishes, they ask if you'd like more, which I can appreciate. 

Don't come here if you want to have a private conversation. It's an open concept, food court-like atmosphere with no barriers."}
{"text":"Still one of my favourite Korean places in GTA !

My go to is the dotsol bibimbap which comes with a simple soup on the side. I love the crunch of the rice on the bottom of the stone pot and it hit the spot on a cooler spring day. 

This time around there were different new side dishes that I've never had including sweet potatoes. 

Again their kimchi is also amazing (and this is coming from someone who can't tolerate spice usually)."}
{"text":"Was craving some Korean food and found this restaurant in my area, and was excited to try it out as it was supposed to be quite authentic. 

A nice space, but a little dimly light. Came here later in the evening with a friend, and decided to go for the table cooking BBQ. Despite the later time, the restaurant was still quite busy.

We went for the beef table cooking, and was really good. Gave you all the accompanying ingredients for your lettuce wrap with lots of options. The beef was delicious, and cooked nicely by the servers. They even explained how to best cook it. The meal for two came with a Pork Bone Soup as well and it was very flavourful and spicy, just the way I like it!

The servers were all very nice, and checked on the table quite often. Came to help cook the beef, give us more ingredients, and just ask how the experience was.

Definitely enjoyed the experience and will be back to try the pork belly! Kamsahamnida!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night with my parents and it wasn't as packed as I thought it would be. Even though it's located inside a mall, the restaurant itself was pretty nice.

We ordered the bajirak kalguksu, kimchi fried rice, and spicy chicken with rice. 

The bajirak kalguksu was great and they definitely didn't skip out on the mussels. The kimchi fried rice was fantastic. It had this interesting smoky flavour that I liked. The spicy chicken was really flavourful and savoury. I enjoyed it a lot! Also, the side dishes were on point. 

All in all, solid Korean restaurant. Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Local Korean spot !

Having only gone twice I absolutely love the place. It's got a lot of choose from. Soups fried foods to various rice dishes! Richlane centre always serves great food choices and this place is definitely  one of them! GTA food lovers must stop by for a taste:)

This place is a little local Korean restaurant by Markham and Richmond hill. I would say tops other various Korean places which tend to be more expensive. The portion at this place is also quite big. It gets really busy around dinner time! It's got a variety of your basic Korean dishes to fried pork belly barbecue. Definitely a place to check out for good authentic Korean owned and food prices food.

Warning closes kinda early!"}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night, it was busy and we had to wait 20 minutes-ish for a spot.

We ordered the boodoe jigae jeongal (army stew). It comes with sausage, spam, dumplings, rice cakes, noodles, mushrooms and watercress. Tons of stuff, a large portion that can feed 2-3 people. It was spicy and sweet, all rounded great flavour. $35.99, I found it more expensive than other Korean restaurants. 

Service was OK, you have to flag someone down for anything. Overall, a good Korean restaurant to eat at in Richmond Hill"}
{"text":"My Dolsot Bibimbap arrived with a clear soup with green onions in it as well as a bottle of spicy paste for me to add to the hot stone bowl as needed.  I mixed all the ingredients (assorted vegetables like carrots, mushrooms, spinach and fried egg) together and the purple rice that came with it (usually white rice is served in a bimbimbap).  The bibimbap was good.  I wish there was a little more beef in it though and I thought that I could have eaten a little bit more.  The portion might have been a little small for someone else.

The prices were reasonable here and I wouldn't mind coming back in the future to try some more dishes."}
{"text":"When I crave Korean food but don't want to drive out to Yonge and Finch area, I come here. There's free parking and I have not had to wait for a table (no, I don't mean it's empty because no one eats here). I'm not Korean but it seems like authentic Korean food (compared to other places I've been) including cute decor and those thin metal chopsticks! Oh, and the food is delicious accompanied by friendly staff :)"}
{"text":"Looking for a korean restaurant and came across this one. We had a couple items we love to order when having korean.  The kalbi was under seasoned. Missing that characteristic sweet flavor... it was there just very faint. We also had the deep fried chicken with red pepper sweet and sour sauce... not what we expected... other places we've been to make it crispy... it was not here.  Perhaps need to be double fried or more starch in place of four in the dredge.  The saving grace was the pork bone soup... good amount of meat on the bones.  Value was pretty good.  Service needs improvement the staff were glued to the TV at one point. When aging for help needed to call out to them a couple times... in other restaurants the staff stand at attention scanning the room for persons with needs. When they are paying attention they are nice and helpful. Maybe just a very interesting episode of a Korean sitcom?"}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews of this place. I finally found the chance to pay a visit to this Korean restaurant. First thing I noticed was, this place gets packed fast. When I arrived, they were 1/2 full. After I started looking at the menu, lots of people flowed right in.

So I looked thru all the pictures on Yelp for this place to decide on what to order. Then my friend and I decided on spicy pork bone soup and the omelet rice. The latter came out first. The omelet rice wasn't bad, smells good and tasted alright. The spicy pork bone soup was leaning towards the over peppery side. So food wasn't bad. Service was pretty decent. They were on the ball when we asked for napkins or more tea.

Overall experience is a 3.5/5. Better than some Korean places I've been to recently."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by their combos. If it says it's \"good for 4\", you're better off bringing 1-2 extra people unless you have a group of 300lbs men with a crazy craving for Korean food. At first glance, you might think: \"$18 for a plate of sweet and sour fried chicken?? That's too much!\". But what you don't realize is that the plate takes up 1/4 of the table. 

Four friends and I came on a Friday night and ordered their family combo A-2. It was ~$80 for grilled pork belly, a choice of seafood pancake or Japchae (glass noodle), a choice of fried chicken or some other fried meat, and a choice of the Gamjatang (pork bone soup) or the spicy rice cake dish. I am a huge fan of being given the illusion of choice, so all these selections excited me. 

1) The grilled pork belly was something I've never tried before. They came in raw slices with a grill for a DIY experience. You wrap it with some greens and sauce in a lettuce leaf and then you feel yourself giving up on your diet hopes and dreams. 

2) The seafood pancakes were delicious, with lots of seafood. We actually ordered an additional plate of Japchae because we had a crisis deciding between these two. It was probably the most delicious Japchae I've ever had, delicious noodles swimming in garlicky goodness. 

3) The sweet and sour fried chicken is amazing and is a sight to behold but with all the food we were working through, it lost a bit of its crispiness by the time we got to it. 

4) By the end, we were dreading the Gamjatang because we were already suffering from too-much-food first world problems and we just KNEW that the Gamjatang here would be able to feed a village. It comes on a hot pot stove, warmed up and spicy with four bowls of purple rice. We ended up packing most of it home. I did get to pick my way through a bone and drink some soup. It was on the pretty good end of average. 

The bill came to around $120, which is very reasonable for 5 extremely satisfied stomachs. Be prepared to wait in line as this place gets a pretty significant dinner rush. They also roped off a table for some plants. Those must be some pretty special plants.

(44/100) - 2016"}
{"text":"Love their appetizers! They change the varieties from time to time. Service is okay, parking is crazy during the weekends though."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner for Korean BBQ. This place is NOT an ayce. Its located inside a complex of Asian restaurants, its small so go early if you don't want to wait long. I suggest 5/6:30 time frame. 
From the moment we walked in we were greeted  promptly and friendly manner. 
We ordered a dinner for 2 which fed 3 of us. It was $55.99 plus tax for the beef BBQ to cook at our table and choice of pork bones, seafood or tofu soup. All the usual \"ban Chan\" came these are the pickled radish, kimchi, sliced fish (which in my earlier yrs of eating Korean food I thought was fried tofu --lol) and a few other pickled vegetables.  My favorite was the purple rice, its just purple but taste the same as white rice. Cool factor there. We ended up having pork bones soup and they were generous with the pork bones meat in that soup. I didn't find it spicy at all, like some places I've had. It was real good. 
I will definitely go back to this place as the food was fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Mediocre Korean food and a bit overpriced compared to Koreatown prices. The side dishes come in small portions and the kimchi tastes old. I got the pork bone soup which was decent. Probably wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"Decided to try out this Korean restaurant instead of driving all the way out to North York.  It's a restaurant within a plaza almost food courtish type of restaurant.  The place is not the cleanest, but decent size.  

The menu looks like that of a typical Korean restaurant and has all the usual foods you would expect.  Not wanting to be too adventurous in case the food wasn't that great we stuck to the basics and ordered the dolsot bibimbap, seulrongtang and kampoonggi.  I didn't try the dolsot bibimbap but you can't really go wrong with the stone pot with rice and vegetables. 

The seulrongtang was so so as you could tell there wasn't much effort put into it.  The kampoonggi was a little on dry and bland side, but again so so.  

This place is somewhere I would only go if I couldn't make the drive out to North York but definitely not a place a would intentionally seek out again.  Also, the prices on the dishes were about $2-3 more than typical Korean restaurants that serve better quality food.  The only highlight I would say is that they do provide ample side dishes, but overall you are better off saving your money and going elsewhere for Korean food.  I would give it 2.5 stars if I could but rounded up."}
{"text":"I come back for the purple rice. Food is ok for the area. The service isn't the best, they spilled the dish they were serving all over me once, but gave me $20 for dry cleaning. Overall recommend"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a second try after disliking it the first time around... Only to be disappointed again. 

First time around, my colleagues reserved at table for 7 people at 1pm. We got there not even 4 minutes late and they already given away our table to a group of 3. There were a couple of small tables were leaving at the time. I complained after they told us we would have to wait 10-15 minutes. They eventually figured it out but the male server gave us attitude the entire time. They only gave us one set of side dishes even though the other big table had a couple. I got a dolsot bibimbap and this is probably one of the worse bibimbap I ever had. It had no flavour and no texture... The rice did not get crispy and the flavours of the veggies and meat did not come out. Everything kinda just tasted like one pile of mush. The chili sauce was very mild but was the only good thing about this dish. 

Second time, I came with a smaller group and got a table right away. They do not clean their utensils very well as there was a bright pink lipstick mark still on the cup! The side dishes are good... I really enjoy their kimchi and seaweed. I got the pork bone soup this time. Portion was pretty big and there was quiet a bit of meat. However the soup is lacking. There was very little flavour... it wasn't peppery or spicy or anything really. Perhaps I prefer bolder spicier flavours. 

For this price, I probably will stop coming here as the only good thing seems to be their side dishes."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night with the boyfriend, after seeing the great reviews on Yelp. Unfortunately we seem to have come at a bad time, since the gamjatang and the soondubu that we ordered were both pretty bland. Both of our soups tasted very watered down and had no flavour. The banchan on the other hand, was full of flavour and our favourite part of the meal! Probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"One of the better Korean restaurants in Richmond hill/markham. Great price, huge portion size for the family combo and food was awesome. Pork bone soup wasnt oily ..seafood pancake was good also. Definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"2.5 I'm not really sure what to make of Han Mi Jeong as I've only had one dish here but nothing about my meal impressed me - I'll reserve final judgment for another visit but coming out of my way to eat here was a minor disappointment. 

Like most, you will have to wait if you come at prime time, as all the tables seat 4+ people and the place is rather small itself. The place is a bit in un-optimized if you're just coming with a +1. The menu is very simple with most of the Korean staples on it.

I primarily judge a korean restaurant by its banchan side dishes and that's where I was disappointed with HMJ. While they were decent, nothing stood out. Some of them were definitely on the saltier side. I went with their soondubu jiggae for the main course and was quite satisfied. There's plenty of actual seafood and tofu there, which is awesome. As for the actual soup itself, it was on the saltier side with a ton of spice (but not in a bad way). 

Please note if you like to split bills and pay by card, you can't really do that here as there is a minimum payment of $20 for using it."}
{"text":"Authentic Korean food and we don't have to travel far. The food and service is always great. The only thing is you may need to line up for a while on busy weekend nights but we could wait an hour just so we can eat here! Their pork belly family combo is sooo good. Comes with pork belly and an assortment of other dishes like family size japchae, spicy chicken, seafood pancakes, and also a family size soup! Definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of mul-naengmyeon (Korean icy noodles) and will order it where ever available. This place charges $12.99 for the dish, which is significantly more than other Korean joints I have been to (literally all.) and the noodles came LUKEWARM. 

I have literally never been more grossed out by noodles, it was a really hot day and ingesting a bowl of lukewarm noodles was not ideal. I don't really care if the side dishes were available for refill at this point.

The only thing that saved the day was the bulgogi, had a decent amount of beef in it and was really fairly priced!

Meh overall."}
{"text":"I give this place only 3 stars because for one when I ordered the Tofu Dolsot Bibimpap with no egg. It came with an egg. And two because I kept finding pieces of beef in my meal. My guess is that the cook accidentally threw in the beef and realized afterwards it was supposed to be vegetarian. I was too hungry to have it sent back so I just picked off the meat and gave my egg to my friend. All in all the bibimbab was alright, I've had better and I probably wouldn't go back. Places like this who are so careless make me not want to dine out anywhere."}
{"text":"Came here at 6 on a Saturday for dinner. The place was already pretty full when I arrived and by the time I ordered my food there was a line up of people waiting for a table. 

I ordered the chicken katsu for $10.99 which came with a large portion of chicken that should be more than enough to fill anybody up. Food quality wise I would say that the food was only about average. There was nothing special about what I had. 

In terms of service, I would say the service was only okay. Because they were quite busy it took a while to get the attention of a waiter. The side dishes also took a while to arrive. It did not arrive right after I ordered but rather came at the same time as my order. The waiters, however, were very friendly and polite so kudoos for that. 

The restaurant itself does not have a bathroom. If you need to use the bathroom you have to walk out of the restaurant and use the one in the plaza that the restaurant is located in. 

Candy came along with the bill, which I thoroughly enjoyed."}
{"text":"I thought this place would be packed on a weekend from some of the reviews that I read but when I went at 1pm on a Saturday, there were only three tables with people.

My friend ordered the don katsu and I got the soondubu jigae. Service was quick as side dishes came immediately after we placed our order. I also loved how the waitress came midway to check on how we liked our meal. 

Honest truth, from seeing such a high rating for a Korean restaurant (after I posted this review the rating went from 4 stars to 3.5), I kind of expected more of an authentic flavour--especially in their side dishes. However, I was slightly disappointed as I found some of their side dishes a bit under-seasoned. For example, the soybean side dish could have been more sweet; also, the soybean bean sprout could have used some sesame oil flavouring.The soondubu jigae was alright but the flavour of the soup base could have been more developed. Nonetheless, as other reviewers mentioned, this place does serve purple rice, which is probably what I like most about this restaurant."}
{"text":"Solid Korean restaurant in a slightly ghost-town plaza. I got the seafood soft tofu soup and it had the right amount of spice. Broth was really flavorful. I can't really say much more right now, but I wish I did - I want to go back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Good service, good food and friendly staff! I tried their spicy tofu stew while my friend had their pork bone soup. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Best Korean food in Markham area.

I've been here multiple times and it never disappoint. Food is amazing, service is always good, ambience is good too. Food we tried that are amazing:
- Fried Chicken
- Pork Bone soup (soup is very tasty, perfect for winter)
- Seafood ramen soup (Jjampoong)

Note that it can be crowded and waiting list sometimes."}
{"text":"Busy restaurant with good service. Came on a weekend after 7pm. Waited for 30 minutes for a table. Staff were timely with refills of banchan and tea. Food came within a good time. 

Presentation was good. The restaurant was clean and modern looking .

Banchan are always good. Seaweed a bit on the bland side. Kimchi homemade. Could have done without the radishes  (not a big fan)

I ordered the dolsot bipimbap for $11.99. It came with purple rice which is something you don't see in all korean restaurants. 

Dolsot was actually sizzling hot. I have experienced some restaurants with warm stone bowls, which made you wonder why you paid the $2 more for it. 

One negative is that the waiter forgot to bring the sauce for the bipimbap. But great food. I will return again."}
{"text":"Finally there is a very good Korean restaurant in Markham. This is the second time I'm here. Their service is very good. Even not enough waitress but they are quick and calm. The food is really good. I have try pork belly, ginseng soup, pork bone soup, wheat noodle and they are all very good. There side dish is also very good. When there is Korean people come to Korean restaurant then you know they are authentic."}
{"text":"Doesn't take reservation and so we decided to come here earlier at around 615 on sat. We got lucky people after us had to wait!

We ordered a combo for four which is totally enough for 5 to 6 people
The food was good
- Beef with mixed veggie; those cooked and served on a stove in front of you. A bit too sweet to my liking but taste alright. Perhaps next time order those beef slices instead
- Seafood pancake had a lot of seafood and had crispy edge - must order
- Pork bone soup very nice. With whole potato! The spice and seasoning was very good. Also came with rice. Must order
- spicy/sweet/sour chicken. Such a big plate! I would expect the crust/ breading to be crunchier but it wasn't. It's alright

Maybe next time we will order the food separately rather than in a combo. The rice cake next table looked very appetizing :p

Totally right at $100 for 4 people but definitely can feed 1-2 more people!"}
{"text":"For solid Korean food without having to travel down to Yonge/Finch or Bloor/Christie, Han Mi Jeong fits the bill.

The banchaan are plentiful and there is a nice variety but the star is the kimchi. I prefer a sweeter and spicy kimchi versus the more popular vinegary and spicy kimchi and Han Mi Jeong serves the former.

We've tried almost everything on the menu and if you have a large enough party, the Kampoongki ($21.99) is pretty good as the amount of fried chicken you get is pretty crazy as it comes out on an extremely large plat. The family combos that come with a grilled meat and soup are delicious and definitely can fill groups of 4 or more.

Today we ordered:

Doenjang Jigae ($10.99)
A classic soup that doesn't get as much love as Gamjatang. It is often said that a Korean restaurant and chef gets evaluated on how good their soy bean paste soup is and this one comes loaded with seafood, tofu and veggies. Their is the perfect amount of soy bean paste and nothing is overcooked. It doesn't look the greatest, the the flavours are wonderful.

Tookbaegi Bulgogi ($11.99)
If you don't like a strong flavour or can't handle spicy, this soup dish is nice and sweet (not dessert sweet though). It comes with thinly sliced marinated beef (bulgogi) in a sweet soy sauce based soup along with clear noodles and vegetables."}
{"text":"What a great find for us.  We actually tried 3 times before we were able to eat here.  The parking lot is mad small and busy.  So, we plotted early lunch and were finally successful.  We went for lunch twice making sure to be there no later than 11:45.  Parking is no problem at that time.  Overall, the mall is really quiet, most of the stores were closed but majority of restaurants were open and seem to be very popular especially the bbq place with line ups out the door once.
Han Mi Jeong is a nice spacious restaurant.  Friendly staff and we were seated right away.
The menu has a lot of great options.
We've had:
- bulgogi: not as flavourful but I like it because it isn't salty and the beef is very tender
- LA Galbi: my husband declares it the best he's had
- pork donkatsu: my son liked it so much he wanted to orders (he's 13, he eats and eats and eats)
- gamjatang: delicious broth, spicy, big portions
- tteokbokki: spicy, sweet, savoury, delicious sauce, soft pillowy rice cakes but the fish cake was hard
- fried dumplings: nice
- the kimchi: I love it, I am nowhere a kimchi expert but this kimchi really appeals to me

All generous portions, enough to take home.  Second time, rice had a hard crusty layer on top, they replaced them promptly when asked."}
{"text":"A for food, B- for service. Great selection of banchan, with cucumbers and potato noodles and soy beans. Got three things - the galbitang, the pork bone soup (gamjatang) and the bulgogi hot stone bowl (tookbaegi bulgogi). Loved all three and their different flavors. I'll just say that for all the soup based ones (galbitang and gamjatang), you can really taste the bone based broth's flavors. Couldn't stop slurping the soups. The galbi bowl, even though it has a soupy base, I'd say don't drink it - it's very very sweet sauce lol. They are generous with the meat!

If you want refill of the banchans, there's no charge. But if you want more rice, it's $1.50, which I think is a little much (the other places that I go to have never charged me extra for rice that they just scoop out) - they also didn't tell me or check with me, so knocking off one star for that. Also, people working there will understand straightforward English. If you want recommendations, or have more complicated questions like allergies or what they would recommend, best to do your research beforehand because they seemed lost."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and they have been consistently good. The menu has gotten bigger so a lot more options. Everything we have tried has been good (including kalbi, kimchi fried rice, kimchi jijigae, bimbimbap, and kalbitang), great service, and a good assortment of banchan. One of the best Korean restaurants in Richmond Hill/Markham."}
{"text":"Loved the variety of banchan.  I have been here a few times and the food is very good.  Today I am having the Omelet Rice (made with purple rice).  There was so much food I had to take the rest home.  The prices are average and service is good.  Would have liked more variety of food on the menu (I didn't see any dishes under $9.95?) 

I miss NourishU, an Asian fusion restaurant which used to be here."}
{"text":"Side dishes are great here which include seaweed, glass noodles, radish, kimchii, soy beans and fried fish paste I think.

I got my pork bone soup as usual at a Korean restaurant. There is a good amount of pork bone but there was little meat on the bone for me. I found the soup salty but still good to drink. Love that they serve purple rice here and for $9.99 the whole meal is great value.

Service was great."}
{"text":"I've been searching for a place with a good pork bone soup and came here based on the strong reviews. 

It definitely did not disappoint!  We ordered 2 pork bone soups, one spicy pork belly sizzling plate and one seafood pancake.

The pork bone soup was absolutely delicious.  Tender, high quality pork bones coupled with a nice spicy broth , along with purple rice, it was one of the best ones I have had in a while.  Moreover, the portions were huge!

The sizzling plate and seafood pancake were also well made, with generous portions of meat for each.  This place is a tad more expensive than your average korean restaurant, but well worth it in terms of quality and portion.

I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Price is good. Service, not so much.

Walked in with two buddies and was pointed to a table beside the bar that has the ledge hanging over the table. Since it would be a little cramped for my two friends to share one side, I asked if we could sit at the booth. The waitress let out a big sigh with a frown, as she looked over to the booth which just became empty, so it had to be cleaned up first. Realizing her displeasure, I waved my hand and told her to forget it, and that we'll just sit where we were first pointed to. After all, I came here for food, not look at annoyed faces. I could find the latter on Google images without a fee.

We sat down and looked at the menu for a few minutes. My friends were first time here, so it took some time to decide. Another waitress appears beside us and pulls her pen and paper out without saying a word. We kindly requested for a few more minutes. Looking annoyed, without a word, she looks away and then looks at her wristwatch as she strolls off. It was 9:05, and they were closing at 10:00. They want to get off earlier if possible - I get that.

I don't like to stay over the stated closing time, as that makes people work overtime. We ended up leaving before 10:00 with around 4 tables of guests left, so we were definitely not keeping them from closing. Their restaurant has been quite popular lately, so I suppose they have been very busy and are stressed out. However, I feel that is not enough to justify the negative attitude. In general, business for the Asian cuisine industry in the area has been rough for the past few years.If I opened a restaurant during these times, I would imagine myself to feel fortunate to have such a bustling business. They, being a family business, should also be happy for business. After all, that's what I would open a restaurant for. Not to swat flies.

I do not take personally the blunder of this early business, but it will be a while until I revisit to see if they've improved their positive energy. I look forward to positive change, which, in turn, will improve my review."}
{"text":"Great tasty food but service was a bit slow. 

We came on a Saturday night around 7PM and had to wait around 15 minutes. They didn't have enough servers so we had to wave multiple times to get tea, our bill and an extra dish for our food. We ordered the Pork Belly table cooking. It comes with a generous portion of pork belly and a soup dish (either pork bone soup or tofu), two rices and the standard side dishes. We got the Seafood Soon Tofu which was great. The side dishes were also tasty.

Overall, I enjoyed the food and would visit again."}
{"text":"Large portion size, friendly service, definitely going back. Go early to get a seat, it got busy as soon as we sat down around 7pm."}
{"text":"This place is often very busy and you can expect line ups during weekends. I like that they serve purple rice and have good side dishes. 

Most of the time I get takeout and it's no wait. One fewer star due to tight seating, wait time and slightly above average pricing (though still cheap in general)"}
{"text":"Had a craving for Korean and yelped this place.  Read some of the reviews and decided to try the Tangsuyuk (sweet & sour pork) and the kalbi beef ribs.  Just as the reviews say, they freely offer refills on all the side dishes and your meal comes with purple rice.  The amount of food for the price is reasonable compared to other restaurants.  The dishes were all well flavoured. The only reason I would give them 4 stars is because their service was a little lacking.  When they brought us the side dishes, didn't have any utensils at our table.  They brought us tea, but no cups. Granted...they were a little busy, but still...
Even so, I would definitely go back again and try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Went with 2 friends who recommended me this place. We ordered the family meal which was a very good deal for our entourage. But the wait time to get service was unbearable as our dinner took 3 hours instead of 1. 
Food was average and by authentic korean food standards, it can be considered subpar. 
I was going to give this place three stars but when i slept the night after i ate the food, i woke up at 4am searching for water. Turns out the msg level is quite high. But since msg is so high, you would expect it to taste good, but it was so subpar, i just cant in my good conscience give this place a good rating."}
{"text":"This place is a family owned Korean restaurant that is really good and has cheap specials!

I had the pork belly special for 2 people but is enough for 3 and comes with a platter of pork belly which you cook yourself over a barbecue, lettuce, a greens dish and sauces for making pork belly wraps. Haven't done this kind of dish before so it was interesting and pretty delicious. It also comes with pork bone soup and 2 bowls of purple rice.

Did I mention the unlimited refills on sides, they don't have the potato sides nor the bean sprouts but they come with jap chae, tofu strips, kimchi and beans.

This deal was only $35 so it was super worth it for what we got and it was fairly good quality as well and a huge variety of things we got for this special.

I have to admit the service is kind of weak because they're kind of under staffed, but the staff put in their best effort and were super nice, it was just hard to get their attention sometimes because they're so busy."}
{"text":"We had Jampeong and fried spicy pork for dinner.  The portion was huge!  The spicy pork with black rice was exceptionally well done.  Cooked just right and the Korean sweet spice enhanced the flavor further.   Would even be nicer if they cooked with kimchi.  The Jampeong was good but the noodle seemed a little over cooked.  Nice portion of seafood, and the soup base was amazing.  We saw many ordered pork belly bbq.  It says for 2 ppl on the menu but really think it's enough for 4 ppl.  Will definitely go there again and try that"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Han Mi Jeong is located inside Richlane Mall up at 16th Avenue and Leslie. Opened just over one week... very excited to see this addition at this secluded mall! I came here for dinner on a late Monday night. The place was clean, well lit and welcoming. Our server was a younger gentleman and was very easygoing and personable... unlike other Korean restaurants where they just drop off the food and never check up on us unless we flag them down for the bill.

Complementary appetizers (6) were delish. It was very nice of the staff to actually tell us that they are all refillable... although we always assume that they are refillable :P I love their sweet kimchi (not a lot of restaurants serve sweet ones!) and their roasted peanuts were great to snack on!

My friend and I ordered the Tangsookyuk to share. Flavours were spot on, I love how they incorporated apples and oranges into this sweet pork dish :) The portion was huge and it was very satisfying. We also ordered the sweet marinated beef in soup and it came with purple rice. I was a bit disappointed when they don't have buckwheat cold noodles... menu should've indicate that it was not available. I was having such a huge craving too! Never assume that it is too cold to have cold noodles (nor ice cream) in the winter.

I would love to come back and try more items. Generally, Korean food is hearty and delicious and it has become my fave kind of comfort food. What makes this place stand out was the attentive and personable service (they don't have the Korean button, so they always have to be on their A game)... and a good korean show playing on TV in the background. The restaurant was playing Running Man (that popular Korean game show), it was SO hilarous, although I had absolutely no idea what they are saying lol!

The only con I have was that the server was on his cellphone the whole time (-0.5 star). I know it is a slow Monday night but try to do it behind counters, so it looks a bit more professional in the store front. Other than that, keep up the great work :)"}
{"text":"I'm not usually a big fan of Korean food but this place opened up in Richlane mall. Appetizers are free and they change them weekly so that every time you come back it's different which is really nice. I ordered the pork bone soup and by far this is my favourite place for it. The broth taste like there's not a lot of MSG added. Most dishes that you order come with a side of rice. They have purple rice which is amazing. The environment is really clean and it was a very relaxing place to enjoy my meal. On the side of each table they have a cute little box that has chopsticks and spoons that you can take from it to set the table. I just didn't find the customer service too great. You must spend over 20$ and over in order to use interac or MasterCard."}
{"text":"The food I have to admit is good.  But we ordered 6 dishes and they forgot my fathers.  We asked 3 times and no one knew what was happening.  They finally started to cook it after we all had pretty much finished our food. 

So.... the food is good, the service is pretty good as well.... but forgetting a dish is really bad.  One person was left without food and we all gave dad parts of ours. 

The server offered us a discount to take the dish home.... I said fine since there is no point in putting the dish in front of us we are done eating at this point.  And he gave us 10%. 

Sorry that's not ok, you forgot the dish, you didn't bring it out until after we were done eating, the plate should be free. 

In any case we are going to try this place again but maybe on a Wednesday when they can handle the volume."}
{"text":"They're teokkbokki is so so good!!! It's $10.95 and it's on the appetizer menu. The servers are super friendly and they are so polite. They serve so fast and they're so efficient! I absolutely love coming here for lunch because it's quick and easy. 

I would highly recommend this place but I have no idea if this place is traditional Korean."}
{"text":"Visited here several times with friends and family.

I always get prompt service here, and the food quality and selections are very good!
The pricing is average to many other korean places, and they are authentic.
I often come here for their 2 person pork belly meal that comes with a pork bone soup or tofu stew, it's good enough to eat with 3-4 people if you're not big eaters.

I've visited places that make you pay extra for lettuce wraps, but they don't here, and I love that about them!  They only service purple rice here, no regular white rice, healthy :)

Would highly recommend to all, especially those of you who live in york region!
The only downfall I would say is that they close fairly early, compared to other korean places at yonge and finch or even first markham place.  But... come early!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for Gamjatang (Korean Pork Bone Stew) in Richmond Hill area, this is definitely the place.  My daughter has become a huge fan of this dish so I'm always looking for new Korean places to try.  I'm sure there are lots of good ones by Yonge & Sheppard area but it's a little far for us.

We tried the Gamjatang requesting for mild spiciness which was done perfectly.  The soup was very tasty and very generous portion of pork bones. The dish that really stood out for us was the Omelet rice.  This is going to be the dish that will get us coming back.  They also gave us a good variety of banchan dishes (complementary side dishes).  We also got the Doenjang Jjigae (soybean paste seafood tofu stew).  This was okay but I'll likely not be ordering this dish again.

If you live in the area and feel like Korean food, I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years but lately haven't been there. What a disappointing surprise in terms of price and quality of food now.

Pork bone soup is now $10.99. There is no ingredients in the soup, just bones and sauce. There was one big bone and a few small bones with very little meat. Looks like they used cheap soup bone. 

I would not recommend this place anymore."}
{"text":"Really yummy authentic Korean food!
Had a nice experience here, and will definitely come back!

They give you a lot of banchans (side dishes) and they were all yummy. Also, the waiter kindly asked us if we would want refills which is really nice!

We ordered the omurice, which was SUPER YUMMY! It was my favourite dish tonight! Very flavorful and was packed with ingredients. I love how they use purple rice for all their dishes too!

The mulnaengmyun (cold buckwheat noodles) was pretty average, but they give you a lot of sauces to eat with it: sweet chili sauce, mustard, and vinegar.

The tangsookyuk was ok. It's originally pork but I requested for it to be made with chicken instead. It's a unique taste but the chicken was way too breaded. Couldn't taste the actual chicken :$

Keep note that their portions are big! The tangsookyuk was HUGE. So make sure you come here with friends!

The BBQ was super yummy! Thick slices of juicy meat! Very good price as well! Tastes a lot better than Nak Won in First Markham Place.

Would come again to try some of their soup dishes and hotpot! :3"}
{"text":"Recently tried this restaurant and it was great! I was happy that there was more than one barchan option and the food was up to par! If you want to see videos and pictures of my meal check out my youtube channel for the full review! Link is below

{"text":"This is one of the cheapest most authentic Korean places I've been to.

Han Mi Jeong is located within a Chinese mall north of 16th avenue.  The restaurant is tucked inside Rich Lane - a Chinese mall.  

There is limited seating and almost always a line out the door around dinner and lunch time.  

The one negative thing about this place is that they're slightly understaffed so you're basically competing with other customers to get their attention.  
They also close at 10PM (approximately) & don't accept anybody past 9:00PM (they turned away a family around 9:15PM).

Now onto the good stuff,
The food here IS SO GOOD.  Their family combos are one of the only family combos that saves you $.  For $60 we got a big plate of glass noodles & beef (jappchae? jap(something) that we couldn't finish, we got a pork bone soup that was heated up at the table and kept warm (didn't finish), and a bulgogi with noodles (cooked at the table) and lettuce - the one we did finish.  It says that it's for 3 people but we had 4 people at the time and it was not doable.  

I'm going to eat the leftovers for today and tomorrow.  I'll definitely be back within the next week or so to try their other foods with my fam :)"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Korean food (and I'll be honest, whenever anyone suggests Korean food, I reply \"what else is there to eat\"). But when my friends/family suggest Han Mi Jeong, I am completely 100% for it. They make some really decent dishes that I think are satisfying, and I also like their side dishes that come along with it (and they will give you more if you ask!). 

I really like their bibimbap and their pork bone soup is so tender, flavourful, and not overpoweringly spicy. I also enjoyed their cold noodles, and their bulgogi was tender as well. 

I think what differentiates them from other Korean restaurants is that their service (though minimal) is STILL GOOD (unlike cough Nak Won) and they serve brown/purple rice without any extra cost! So awesome!"}
{"text":"This place was always on top of our list when crave for Korean food but probably not anymore. The food quality has gone down, portion got a lot smaller now."}
{"text":"Love their pork bone soup, it's a must to try! Their BBQ combos are also very delicious and comes in a great portion. I work around there and go all the time!"}
{"text":"2.5 (round up to 3 since it is quite new)

I really expected that Han Mi Jeong opened up inside Richlane Mall since it adds variety to the existing restaurants line up. Cantonese, HK Cafe, Japanese, Vietnamese and now Korean.

The deco and the set up was just like the 2 previous restaurants that used to be here. Han Mi Jeong did freshened up the interior a little and give it a cleaner look.

Menu is traditional Korean with a lot of emphasis on soups, which is good and I am not into \"fusion\" Korean food that much. Price point is a $1 or $2 higher but without much competition in the area, I am more than happy to pay for some well prepared Korean food.

We ordered the following to share:

Bajirak Kalguksu ($10.99) Manila Clams with Hand Cut Noodle - tons of clams but sadly the broth did not have the complex taste and the noodle was not good.

Kalbi Dinner ($15.99) Beef Short Ribs on Sizzling Plate - cooked with no grill marks and the beef was lukewarm and the plate was not even sizzling?!

Gam Ja Tang ($9.99) Pork Bone Soup - I am no PBS expert but with just 3 small piece of bones and a really simple tasting broth base (lack the herbs and spices, aside from being spicy), I doubt I would order that again.

+0.5 Star for serving purple rice and the banchan was fresh"}
{"text":"Ordered the la beef ribs and pork bone soup combo. 

Worse decision ever.   The pork bone soup tasted great. Probably one of the best ones up town.  The la Kabli was horrible. The plate of ribs that was brought over had grill marks on it like it was a quarter cooked. Pretty gross for table top cooking. It's like someone didn't want the order cooked it a little and put it back. Anyways we  decided to eat it anyways.   Worse idea ever.  Let's just say it wasn't a good night after."}
{"text":"This review is for the family combos for 3 or 4 people.

I am in food comma.  So much food.  Too much food.

I just dined there with friends.  The 5 of us shared Combo B for 4 people ($70).  There were 4 entrees in the combo: beef, pork bone soup, seafood omelette, deep fried chicken.  Each entree filled a big round plate of approximately 12 to 16 inches in diameter.  I meant the food totally filled up the plate.  We kept saying to the guy on table that he should have brought along his hockey player son to help consume the food.  The food didn't taste bad either.  We doggy bagged 5 tall cups and 1 small box of leftover.  

With this level of value, no wonder the restaurant had a full house on a Tuesday evening."}
{"text":"I love Han Mi Jeong!

Any restaurant that ONLY serves purple rice is a friend of mine. Usually that fancy stuff requires a $1.00 upgrade, and considering that most of the items at HMJ are decently priced, my wallet was very happy by the end of the meal.

The place is run by Korean people - the setting, dishes, cutlery are all very authentic. 
The staff are incredibly nice, and they are pretty generous when it comes to banchan refills (bonus!!!).
There's usually a long line during peak hours, so do come early/very late, or just go for take-out. The space is small and turnover times can be lengthy, considering it's a Korean food restaurant.

I've had the following dishes from Han Mi Jeong

- Pork Bone Soup Hot Pot Gamjatang - Really good - flavours are rich and they give you SO much meat
- Spicy Rice Cakes Dukkbeokki - Good, just like most places
- Stone Bowl Dolsot Bibimbap - Ratio of veggies to rice is excellent. Hard to find a place that doesn't give you a mountain of rice with banchan... the portion sizes for the beef are pretty small though
- Deep fried Dumplings Mandu - Good but not as good as other korean places I've been to. Wasn't soggy or overly greasy
- Beef Dumpling Soup Galbi Mandu - VERY flavourful and lots of mandu and beef in the soup. The flavours are very rich and homey. Good for cold days.
- Pork Cutlet Rice Don Katsu - not too oily, crispy, comes with two orange slices and shredded vegetables with thousand island dressing. Pretty nice!

Will be back to add onto my list very soon :~~~)"}
{"text":"This is a small Korean restaurant located inside Richlane plaza. Food was very standard and similar to other Korean restaurants. 
We got a family combo for 3 which cost around $70; kinda pricy IMO but this combo was definitely more than enough for 3 people. It came with bulgogi (cook at your own table), a family size noodle, family size noodle soup (cook at your own table). Bulgogi was tasty and plentiful. Noodle soup was too salty for my liking. 
We also ordered the sizzling beef short ribs to share; can't remember the exact price ($16-17?). This was just okay. 
Complimentary side dishes are nice and you can ask for refil if needed. 
Overall, it was an okay experience, nothing to rave about. Likely will return if im craving Korean food and happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"Thought the place would be better base on reviews... looks clean from the entrance but it is very crammed inside. It was a busy Saturday evening so apparently you need to get a number, we asked for a table of three and a waitress told us to go to a table. But once we started to settle in another waitress came up to us asking for a number and got booted off the table... very disorganized. 

Once settled in the cups were really wet. The bi bim bap was ice cold, so it was premade and stored in the fridge for a while and the rice came on the side. The service was overall slow,  we needed to ask for the appetizers while the table besides us who ordered food around the same time as us got their food a lot faster. 

Probably won't  be going back. There are better Korean restaurants out there."}
{"text":"Dropped by before the dinner rush so was lucky to avoid the lineup and before it got crowded. Food was great, no complaints here about it. 
We had a good selection of side dishes that were enough to company us until we got our main meals. 

I got the spicy tofu soup with assorted seafood and pork (though it didn't seem like there was any pork in my soup, but I'm not a fan so I'm not going to complain, just a heads up for those who do like it though) and it was very nice; tofu was soft and had lots of flavour. Only downside to it was that the soup got really salty digging further into my meal. Luckily there was enough rice to accompany my food. 

I also got the spicy rice cakes to share with my friend. Lots of flavour there too, not too spicy and just enough to be shared between two to finish. 

While food pleased me, the service didn't. We didn't get a single check up from the waitresses. They completely disregarded us, even when we had to frantically wave them down to get our orders and bills. Honestly, they never even came to check up on us if we needed refills for tea. That was pretty annoying. 

I'll probably come back though, food makes it worth it."}
{"text":"As a person who has no spice tolerance and generally dislikes Korean food as a result, I would actually say I would enjoy coming here from time to time. I will avoid talking about the free appetizers because I do not care for them at other Korean restaurants.

We ordered the tabletop BBQ which serves 2 people and a galbi dish separately for the third person in our group. It was a real struggle to finish all the food. The portion of the meat for the BBQ was fair. I really liked how the meat wasn't excessive in salt or oil. The BBQ combo came with a choice of some tofu soup and pork bone soup. Naturally I had to go for the PBS even though I could not take the spiciness. The broth was flavourful and there was so much pork, we just could not finish it. The combo also included 2 bowls of purple rice and a green salad which had too much raw onions in it. Half of the galbi was chewy but the other half was not. I would say the galbi to be average in terms of meat quality but above average in terms of flavour.

The service was fast but courteous even though the place was full. We did not have trouble waving down the server when we needed him.

All in all this is a good place to eat at if you want big portions of meat while being good value at the same time."}
