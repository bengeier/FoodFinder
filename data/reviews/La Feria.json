{"text":"This place has authentic peruvian food and tasty american style peruvian sandwiches.  Every day they have a choice of two or three vegetarian and two or three non vegetarian entrees.  They serve these with rice and side salad.  My favorites are pumpkin and potato stew and potato, cheese, and pea casserole.  They also make a great egg salad sandwich with guacamole.  The homemade sweet potato chips and alfajores (shortbread cookies filled with caramel sauce and dusted with powdered sugar) are must haves."}
{"text":"Well, I am a really into Latin food.  I am struggling to find it in Pittsburgh.  Empanada with feta and spinach seemed a lot more like Greek than Peruvian and lost much of its allure when our server microwaved it in front of us.  Everything was okay, but just not what I had hoped for.  The menu was weak, and not very authentic... for example: items such as this sandwich (see below) don't rope you in when you're looking for something bold and... um... Peruvian...  VEGETARIANO  $7.95  Lettuce, tomato, sweet potato chips, Swiss cheese, onion salsa & aji mayonnaise served on french bread with a side of sweet potato chips  Bring on the yuca, humitas, ceviche, teqtes, y sopa verde!! Pittsburgh folks may just love experimenting!   La Feria seems well positioned to start a quinoa craze or simply add a little variety to local offerings, I hope they step it up."}
{"text":"We joined friends for dinner at La Feria on a Saturday evening - and I was totally suspicious of Peruvian anything, as the last attempt for Peruvian in Phoenix was absolutely flavorless and boring.  To top it off, this place offers many vegetarian dishes and I'm pretty much a certified carnivore.  I couldn't have been more surprised or delighted at the quality or quantity of the evening special.  It was wonderful to behold, and absolutely flavorful.  I'd go back again; probably try a meat dish, but still, Peru has been redeemed!"}
{"text":"I love this cozy little restaurant!  The $10 meal deal is especially great for indecisive diners like me, and it's always delicious.  I can't comment on how closely they adhere to Peruvian cuisine, because I've never had it before.  The shop is fun too, but I'd feel awkward browsing the art without intending to stay, so I only look around after I'm done eating."}
{"text":"Ambiance:  The atmosphere is a little strange, as the restaurant is upstairs above Pamela's, and is coupled with a Peruvian gift shop. It's nothing fancy, but it's kind of entertaining to look at the knick-nacks while you wait for food.   Food:  I came to La Feria hoping to get some authentic Peruvian food. Although the food was good- i got a pumpkin black bean empanada and some sort of peanut chicken dish- it wasn't anything to write home about. I was hoping for some full-blown authenticity here- I didn't see anything on the menu that screamed \"Peru\"; it all seemed very generic Americanized Latin American. I didn't see one unique ingredient in any of the dishes on the menu. With that being said, I would go back, but I would rather roll the dice in trying to find something more authentic, so I doubt I will be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This delicious Peruvian Restaurant is often overlooked due to its location over the wildly popular Pamela's restaurant.  For those who don't want to wait in line for Pamela's or those who are looking for a great bite to eat, LaFeria is the place for you.  All of the food I've tried there has been great.  Their daily specials are usually yummy and their empanadas and sandwiches are great.  I especially love their salad.  Turkey breast over a bed of greens with red onions, walnuts and gorgonzola cheese dress in a tasty vinegarette.  It's light, yet you wont leave hungry.  While you're there, check out the Peruvian arts and crafts  that are also for sale there."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place for breakfast while checking the wait time in Pamelas. Located upstairs in the same building, there was no wait (the wait at Pamelas was 1 hour), so my party decided to check it out. The place was completely empty, but after looking at the menu I was sold.   The food was absolutely delicious and I was surprised that more people weren't in the restaurant. I got the empanada platter, where you can choose 2 empanadas from their selection of 5 or so empanadas and house soup or salad. For my platter, I ordered an egg empanada (popular choice) and the spinach empanada with their homemade pumpkin soup.  The soup had just the right amount of richness and was absolutely flavorful. The empanadas weren't exactly what I expected, but were tasty. While the empanadas were a little smaller than I had hoped, it had a pastry puff crust with a flavorsome inside.  My friend ordered the tortilla, which came with 2 slices of bread, house salad, plain spanish rice. In my opinion, the tortilla was even better than the empanada platter. The house salad was awesome with the perfect amount of dressing, the tortilla had potato and artichoke inside making it nice and filling, and the rice was tasty even though it was plain.  Additionally, they have a really nice hot sauce that was a paste/chutney like consistency and it really added a nice touch for those who like their food spicy.  Overall amazing experience, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"While I'm not going to crave this food, it was pretty good.  It tasted like home-made Peruvian food, not that I've ever had Peruvian food, or been in the home of a Peruvian.  But it is what I imagine I would have eaten if I grew up in Lima.  I think it's a very reasonable alternative on the Walnut Street strip, especially if you don't want to shell out the $$$ for Panagea or Girasole."}
{"text":"I know this place doesn't have \"authentic\" food. I know it's not always the friendliest place. I know it looks weird, eating in the middle of a store. But for some reason their combination of a simple Dijon salad dressing and rice and always a decent slow cooked pulled chicken meal makes me enjoy solo lunches with a book. Once in a while you should skip the noisy, crowded, expected Pamela's and try something that tastes homemade."}
{"text":"Let's start by saying the food was not that bad...but I'm Peruvian and I was really disappointed because this place is listed as a Peruvian restaurant but there is not a single traditional Peruvian dish in the menu. You can find all kind of Latin dishes (nothing special) but nothing really Peruvian. They are using the microwave to heat up some of the stuff, so that is a big let down. I hope the owner will list this place as\"Latin\", so no more Peruvians will get disappointed like me."}
{"text":"The service here was impeccable (friendly and attentive waiter), but the food was very disappointing.    I had potato and leek soup, which tasted decent but wasn't warmed properly.  I also had \"empanadas,\" which seemed to be made out of puff pastry or crescent dough.  They were nothing like empanadas that I've had in the past.  The beef one tasted strongly of olives (with olives mixed in) and the chicken + cilantro one seemed liked canned chicken with very little flavor.  Bread pudding was way too sweet and lacked any depth.    I would recommend this as a place to buy some pottery, a purse, or an alpaca throw blanket.  It's not a decent place for food."}
{"text":"Went to La Feria for my first time today.  The setting is a bit odd with all of the crafts for sale, but it all works somehow.  The food was very average I thought.  The empandas were a plain, though my Ropa Vieja sandwich was pretty good.  The meat was tender and well cooked and the bread was fresh, it was just lacking a bit in the seasoning / flavor department.    I didn't dislike my meal, but I may look for other lunch options the next time I'm in Shadyside."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Peruvian food in Pittsburgh. I don't live here anymore but when I return, I eat here several times. Food is super fresh, the specials are to die for and their empanadas make me smile. They buy genuine Peruvian goods to sell as well in their gift shop section."}
{"text":"Had the chicken here. Was somehow unevenly cooked and bland. So bland. Friend had a vegetarian special, which was better, but still unimpressive. Realize it was only 12$ for dinner, and yet somehow still entirely not worth it."}
{"text":"I liked La Feria slightly more as a store than as a place to eat.  Even though I didn't buy anything, Bob was interested in a toucan ocarina, and I fantasized about affording a bright orange wooden lobster for my wall.  I also loved the tapestries, the retablos, and the Dia de los Muertos statues.  As for the food, it was pretty good, but I am on the picky side.  In fact, the whole meal was good, with one or two things keeping it shy of great.  We split two specials, one beef and one chicken, and both meats were a bit dry.   We had two empanadas, one spinach/feta and one ground beef.  The fillings were excellent, though they were (sadly!) understuffed.    For dessert we tried the Alfajores, and this was the weakest part of the experience.  The pasty flavor of the thick shortbread cookies completely overwhelmed the mild sweetness of the dulce de leche.  I spent every bite trying to find it, to no avail.  It was a decent amount of food, though not as much as you'd expect for 10 dollars a person (we split the 20 dollar plate).  As for the atmosphere, it's cute, but cramped.  There's tons to look at while you're waiting a short time for your food.  The service wasn't too great: the waitress forgot our limeade.  But they were friendly enough, so I can't complain.  Here's the thing: in Pittsburgh, your pickings in South American food are very slim.  While this might sound like a negative review, it's not intended to be.  Until this area diversifies a bit more (currently at 2% Hispanic), or somehow finds more demand for good, authentic South American cuisine, I highly recommend checking La Feria out.  It's not perfect, but it'll do."}
{"text":"Great peruvian!  Love their housemade salad dressing.   Wish that I could buy it!  Their shredded chicken dishes are always excellent.  Great lunch spot in Shadyside.  Lovely little import store attached.  A favorite!!"}
{"text":"I had takeout- empanadas, soup, and salad. I was happy with everything and would definitely recommend this place for some quality empanadas."}
{"text":"Lunched here with my daughter and we were pleasantly surprised at this hidden gem. I had the lunch special (see photo - shredded chicken breast with apricots and plums), and she had the ropa vieja (slow-cooked shredded beef with onions and tomatoes). Both were excellent and included garlic rice (perfectly cooked), a small salad (good dressing but tough tomatoes), and two small slices of bread (very plain and not much flavor). I would definitely eat here again. My only complaint is that the service was a bit slow, so it would have been nice to have our salads delivered ahead of the main course instead of on the same plate."}
{"text":"La Feria has good food and the staff is great, except the owner. She is grouchy and quite mean at times."}
{"text":"The salad (with walnuts and cheese) and beef ropa sandwich are scrumptious. And the limeade, too."}
{"text":"The food here was really good. I have never had Peruvian food so I can't compare this to any other place. The atmosphere is tight and casual (think diner), with South American stuff for sale. This place is good for lunch, but it's not nice enough for a date (not the first few anyways )."}
{"text":"Service can be a bit slow at times. Also, I rarely see the place crowded. Still, its a good place to eat. Usually people go for the daily specials, where they give you a big plate with their house salad (delicious), a daily-changing entree, rice and some bread. It's about 10 dollars. They usually have 2 vegetarian and 2 non-vegetarian daily options. I love their limeade (its terrifically bright and fresh, made from real limes). Also, if you happen to be really rich (which I'm not) you might fancy buying some of the Peruvian art they sell in the store. Try touching the pelts on your way out, probably the softest fur you've ever felt in your life. Also, they have fun finger dolls, knit to look like naked people. The nudists sell for about 3 bucks a pop though..."}
{"text":"The absolute best for takeout. Pair with wine for movie night. Excellent vegetarian options that carnivores would not pass on"}
{"text":"So glad I decided to stop in! Tastefully set in the middle of a small gallery of Peruvian goods for sale that lends the ambience of the restaurant. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. After  suggestions from my waitress,I decided to try the pumpkin and peanut soup a nice rich delicious melding of two flavors. The \"Latino Flag\"was presented in 3 rows to resemble a flag and receives high marks on flavor and taste. Had to have the coffee which is rich and delicious and took he offer of \"a cup to go\" from the staff, (I couldn't turn it down it was that good). So glad I came upon this little gem and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Nearly empty on a Friday evening around 8:00.  Service was fast and extremely friendly.  The menu is a decent size, with specials posted on a board above the counter.  I got a pumpkin/rice souffle with cheese and peas for $10.50, and it came with salad, rice, and French bread.  However, the salad took up about half the plate, and the rice took up a quarter, which meant that you only end up getting a small portion of the actual entree - disappointing, since it was delicious.  I also had a lemonade, which was not overly tart or overly sweet.  This is a good place to go for a casual meal.  You can definitely go in wearing jeans.  I hope to come back and try more of their specials."}
{"text":"Decent food and very cute interior! I'm not sure how authentic the food is (my Peruvian friend said that what she eats is different than what is served at La Feria) but I've gotten the empanada a couple of times and it's pretty good.   The decor inside is very colorful, and filled with lots of \"souvenir\" type things. The service is excellent, everytime I have been here, it's been someone different and they are always very patient with our group, despite us taking forever to choose an item and asking a million questions about the menu and lingering way longer than we probably should have afterwards.   Kind of hidden above Pam's but you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"If you can't find this place, it's because it's above Pamela's.  I liked all the crafts in here.  It was cute, lots of different things, colorful clothes, toy llamas, etc.  But, I really came here for the Peruvian food.  If you are looking for Papas a la Huancaina or ceviche, it isn't here.  It's salads, sandwiches, empanadas, and a few other entrees like arroz tapado.    This is a good place for a healthy lunch but I would not come here for dinner.  After looking at the menu and nothing jumped at me, I got the empanada platter.  It was...ok.  Not that amazing.  I got the beef, the chicken & cilantro and the spinach empanadas.  The cilantro wasn't even that prevalent in the chicken empanada.  My spinach empanada was comparable to a less flaky spanakopita.  The beef empanada need more flavor!  Sigh.  Don't get me wrong, I wanted to like this place.  I will say, the coffee was good and the server was very pleasant.  This is a nice place to get some cool gifts."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food because I've been waiting so long to be served anything other than a cup of soup in a restaurant that isn't full. The empty cup is still in front of me though.   Update: The food came and was good but certainly not worth the wait"}
{"text":"Tasty food, kind of a strange set up. Above Pamela's restaurant, half shop (selling Peruvian handmade goods)- half restaurant (with Peruvian food). They offer three to four choices each day, meat eaters and vegetarian peruvian dishes, similar to curries. About $10 a plate. Fresh ingredients, friendly waitstaff, clean and comfy environment. They also have fresh squeezed limeade. Highly recommended but not your typical restaurant experience."}
{"text":"NOT PERUVIAN  The food was okay, but 100% definitely not Peruvian thought they decorated the shit out of the place with Peruvian stuff. Staff was realky nice though.   One star less bc it was nothing special by my book One star less for false advertising, imagine thinking you going to get some lomo saltado, or arroz chaufa, or anticuchoz,  or ceviche, or whatever amazing food you might have in mind and find out it's just basically a cafe (sandwiches and stuff) that their specials rotate around one Peruvian dish a day. Smh setting up high expectations just makes the fall that much harder."}
{"text":"The service here was very friendly, and our food was delivered quickly! We really like the large portion sizes and the relaxed and quiet atmosphere. I didn't read other reviews before I went, so I was a bit surprised to see all of the Peruvian craft and jewelry items for sale in the same space as the restaurant seating, but I thought it was all beautiful and only added to the nice cafe atmosphere. Not really a Friday night date destination, but definitely a good place to get a bite to eat!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, especially given the price.  I can't tell how they stay in business, because I've only ever been in there with one or two other parties.  But the food is really good, and the service is friendly and informal.  Come to get away from the crowds on Walnut, and be surprised by the quality of the food.  All entrees come with salad and rice.  My personal favorite is the cream chicken entree - deelish!"}
{"text":"Unimpressed.  Food is okay, and service is good, but it's just not that great.  The food alone would be 4 stars if they were charging a bit less (Yes - I think value matters.  Almost anyone can serve you an above-average meal if price isn't an issue.)  The empanada was pretty good, but $3.50 for a tiny little beef empanada is ridiculous.  They're street food, for chrissake.  (The pickled onion condiment with them is really good, though.)  I had the tortilla de papa, which was pretty good, and my partner had a chicken dish (name escapes me) that was pretty good as well, and the salads were good.    Back to the pricing thing: they do have Inca Kola, which I love, but they charge $2.50 for a can.  I only got one because my partner had never had one, but $2.50?  Really?  I know the profit's in the drinks for restaurants, but a 12-pack of it cost the same as a 12 of Coke the last time I saw it in a grocery store.  Service was good.  Very friendly.  4 stars.  Decor leaves much to be desired.  This is usually an area that doesn't bug me too much with restaurants, but this place looks ratty - worn carpet, cheap tile, faded pictures of someone's trip to Peru, furniture that looks like it belongs in a chain motel breakfast room.  The knickknacks for sale are nice, but they're not in a separate area, so it feels like you're eating in the middle of a gift shop.  Again, not awful if you're charging $5-7 or so per plate, but not when you've crossed the $10 threshold.  1 star.  I'm split between 2 and 3 stars, but I'm skewing low on this place."}
{"text":"This place is located above Pamela's on walnut street. I was seated quickly and the waiter was very kind and attentive. The food came out quickly and was good but nothing special. It seems as though everything is premade and kept warm so it didn't seem too fresh. I didn't get a chance to try them but the empanadas looked delicious. I might go back to grab some to go."}
{"text":"If you go to La Feria expecting to find Peruvian food be prepared to be disappointed. There's no lomo saltado, papas a la huancaina, arroz chaufa, aji de gallina, not even some chicha morada. That being said the food they do offer isn't bad, it's just not Peruvian in my opinion and I was disappointed about not finding any of my favorite dishes on their menu. What you will find are sandwiches, salads, empanadas, beans and rice. Overall it is a good spot to have lunch, the food isn't heavy and tastes fresh. I'll probably eat here again someday but at least next time I'll know what to expect."}
{"text":"I would recommend this place for a quick lunch. I ordered the non-vegetarian special of the day, cilantro chicken with rice, french bread, and salad. The chicken was a bit on the dry side, but it still had great flavor. My meal was $11 (pre-tax and tip) which I thought was fair considering that the salad was extremely fresh and there was a decent amount of meat."}
{"text":"Stop in at lunchtime for the La Feria salad, and make sure to add fresh, roasted turkey. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is more or less one of those hidden gems.  Located in the heart of Shadyside, above Pamela's, who would ever expect a quaint little cafe serving up some surprisingly delicious and affordable Peruvian dishes?  Come over here to enjoy a nice, quick and incredibly tasty meal.  Peruvian food is fantastic because there are a lot of vegetarian options, which make me incredibly happy.  We really enjoyed the vegetarian fritata: eggs, avacado, pepper, onions served with a side of rice and an incredibly tasty salad.  Even better, the beautifully crafted habanero sauce they brought out (without us requesting this, might I add), was absolutely perfect.    Service was great.  The atmosphere was pretty nice: lots of Peruvian art-work, the lighting was a bit too bright for my tastes, but hey I'm being picky at this point.  This is definitely a cafe and not what you'd consider fine-dining.  But for what it is, it's exceptional.  The price is great too: our meal for 2 topped out at around $25?  That's exceptional, especially for the quantity and quality of food.  Give this place a try."}
{"text":"I love this place and have a very fond memory of it........first of all, the food is unique and very good, the service is great and I love the items for sale in giftshop.....I had lunch here with my sister before she passed away (very young) from breast cancer....she is the one who introduced me to the place......it was one of the nicest times we ever had....the place just has a very nice, welcoming, happy, peaceful feel to it.....we were treated very nice, a wonderful memory.....and I've enjoyed the place ever since....."}
{"text":"Interesting Peruvian handicraft exhibition & sales, nice atmosphere. Don't go for the food, though - it's stored in portions and heated in the microwave."}
{"text":"Wonderful food in a relaxed environment.  The staff is always very friendly and attentive.  The menu always features great vegetarian options.  If you don't know which dish to pick there is a delicious combination plate that I like to order.  The menu has a lot of variety and everything appears to be made fresh. La Feria is a gem!"}
{"text":"It's really nice place, nice food, nice service and is cheap. I just didn't like their empanadas."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend last Feb., and chose to visit it based on the positive reviews and the uniqueness of Peruvian food (I don't know of anywhere else in Pittsburgh that serves it).  Unfortunately, what I experienced was mediocre food and some of the worst service I've ever experienced.  My dining companion and I were seated promptly.  After 10 min., the waitress came over and asked about drinks.  After another 10 min., she brought our drinks and asked what we wanted to order.  I ordered the special, which was listed on the chalkboard (don't recall what it was exactly).  The waitress took our orders and went back to put them in.  Fifteen minutes later, the waitress returned, but not with our food.  Instead, she apologetically informed me that the special was not available because they were out of one of the necessary ingredients.  Um, why didn't she mention this immediately after she'd put the order in?  I chose a different entree (this time one of the regular ones), and the waitress went back to put that order in.  It took at least another 15 min. for the food to come out (we'd been there for 50 min., for those of you keeping track), and when it finally did, I was quite underwhelmed.  I don't recall what I ordered, but I know it had chicken and I recall the chicken being dry and bland--clearly, not what I was hoping for in a Peruvian restaurant!  This shouldn't have surprised me, since I noticed the waitress preparing it in the microwave.  Pro tip to restaurateurs: If you need to use a microwave in your food prep, it's best to hide it in the back.  Having been to Ecuador, where the food is similar to Peruvian fare, the food here certainly didn't seem very genuine.  Unsurprisingly, the check took at least 10 min. to show up once we'd finished.  By this time, I was through with this place.  Yeah, it has interesting decor, but that didn't make up for the abysmal service I received here.  Also, none of the people working there seemed to be Peruvian, which is never a good sign in an ethnic eatery.  Based on my experience, I won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Something told me to be adventuresome when my first choice for lunch was closed for the day.  I was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled upon here.  I saw Pamela's and thought oh well, if I can have breakfast for dinner, why not try breakfast for lunch.  When I walked in I saw the sign for the upstairs eatery and it piqued my interest.    I can honestly say I have no clue as to what Peruvian food is and even though I partook in this delicious place I still have no concept into the food except that it tastes amazing.  We were seated almost immediately with menus in hand.  For lunch this place was not busy in the least.  Too bad for everyone else, because this is a great place to have lunch.  I skimmed the menu but the specials board is what really caught my attention.  I cannot remember the name of what I ate, but who cares, because it tasted so good that almost right after I finished my plate, short of licking it clean, I wanted more of the special!  The special was chicken atop cheese curd and then topped itself with pesto.  What an ideal combination of flavors.  The special also came with rice I believe and the house salad.  The salad was mixed greens with a combination of olives, walnuts and carrots.  The dressing was the house dressing and not too heavy or tangy.  Our server seemed a little inexperienced, but I won't hold that against her.  I am going to assume that she didn't know much about Peruvian food either.  Even though she really couldn't answer a lot of our questions about the food, she was swift and made sure we were taken care of.    They also have shelves of Peruvian items that you can purchase if you are so inclined to do so.  I did not while I was here, but it does give you something interesting to look at and start a conversation about during your meal."}
{"text":"Fantastic find.  Great food and unexpectedly awesome little import shop where I picked up some awesome things for the new home.  Good service (got take out) and really enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"This little place is located upstairs above the Pamela's on Walnut street in Shadyside. I was smitten as soon as I walked up the stairs because all around me were beautiful colorful Peruvian handicrafts and in the middle of this craft store, is the cafe-style restaurant. The food is excellent. They always include a vegetarian lunch special among the 2 options for specials and today it was the pumpkin, black bean and corn stew. I got that, but I also decided to order an empanada, because who can resist fresh flaky soft empanadas right? And that remains among the best decisions of my life. DO NOT miss the empanadas if you can help it. The food is quite reasonable and the portions are generous. My entrée came with a large portion of salad, garlic rice and french bread. The servers are very polite and helpful. The perfect end to my meal was the hot cup of strong Peruvian coffee which I highly recommend. Overall, a very enjoyable experience.. and all the more so if you're a arts and craft junkie like me. They had tons of handmade Peruvian goods from footwear to jackets to soft toy alpacas made out of alpaca wool, beautiful mirrors, other curios made out of wood, baskets and several other knick knacks on display and for sale. Be warned, the items are a little pricey though. I could have poked around the store for ever..looking at each and every item on display and burning a hole in my pocket but I decided to go back another time for that."}
{"text":"Love love love. We were desperate for breakfast and instead of waiting in line for mediocre diner food at Pamela's, we went upstairs and OH MY GOODNESS. We loved the food! We were served good coffee (no watery burned or bitter stuff here!) and water right away and quickly made the decision to get the stew on special, the egg empanada, the spinach/feta empanada and the pumpkin peanut soup to share. Portions were a good size and everything was delicately spiced and so tasty! I am STILL craving that pumpkin peanut soup! It was creamy and spicy and filling on a rainy and chilly morning. Then we got the bread pudding for dessert after breakfast (because why not) and we're equally blown away. We made our friends meet us there and will go back next time we're in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"In the few weeks that I've been in pittsburgh, I have already been to this place twice.  The environment of this \"cantina\" is distinctive; tucked in the corner of a peruvian arts store, and co-owned by the people who own Pamela's, this place has \"hit\" once, and \"missed\" once.  They do have a very basic menu which doesn't change, but the items on there are those that you can pretty easily make at home.  The daily specials that they have are the ones that are a bit more elaborate, and come with a few sides, such as rice and french bread.  I previously thought that peruvian food was simply chicken and rice.  Although this is still the main two ingredients they use, this restaurant has definitely changed my perspective on how many different ways they can prepare chicken.  The first time I went I got a \"ropa vieja\", which was a very simple meat-only sandwich.  The second time I went I got a chicken dish that was mixed with dried fruits: that was delicious.  However my fried ordered a grounded pork dish that ended up tasting like glorified taco meat.  Unfortunately that didn't make for a great first impression.  Overall, be wary of what peruvian food specializes in, and order accordingly.  Service is very friendly, and food comes out in 5 minutes because everything is bascially premade at the beginning of the day."}
{"text":"The best food on Walnut Street. Assuredly the best salad in Shadyside. Simple, inexpensive, and fresh describes everything I've ever ordered here. The daily specials are always great, the soups on point, and the salads super fresh.   Walk up the stairs after entering under the Pamela's Diner awning.   Maybe more kalamatas on the salad, otherwise I have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of those places that rates highly on yelp for reasons I do not understand and makes you wonder how it could be a 4 star place. Now I'm not Peruvian and don't pretend to be an expert; however, I was somewhat recently in Peru for 10 days, including a few locations far from Lima. I also have a Peruvian sister-in-law, so I've tried homemade and authentic restaurant-style Peruvian food.   None of the food here even sound Peruvian to me nor reminded me of Peruvian flavors. Where is the plethora of varieties of potatoes? Even Waffles Incaffeinated has mult-colored breakfast potatoes. A couple dishes seem like they could be inspired from some Latin American influences, but again, nothing like what I was expecting from my experience. With all that said we tried all 5 flavors of the empanadas they offered. They were OK at best and that was about as far as the line got pushed when it came to the main dishes. I tried the Tortilla de Papa, which was ok, but a little bland. The rice it came with was plain and the salad's dressing did not pack enough punch for me.  I see some other comments say that this is a hidden gem, but it is on the second floor above a deservedly better restaurant . This place also doesn't even look like a restaurant as it seems to be part market with all sorts of random knickknacks for sale. No where near as appealing as a Cracker Barrel.  Lastly, I saw a few comments say this is the best Peruvian restaurant in the city. I can't even understand how people came to that conclusion. I know there isn't a lot of options for this ethnicity, but Chicken Latino is miles better than this for starters."}
{"text":"A welcome diversification of the Pittsburgh restaurant scene, but perhaps does not live up to it's potential.    The daily changing specials have a nice mix of legumes, tangy sauces and interesting combinations.  What holds it back is a lack of full-bore authenticity (as perhaps would be found at Burma-Tokyo in Oakland).  The lettuce and cheese salad was generic, and the chicken does not have the fall-off-the-bone quality and was a bit dry.  I also heard the beeps of a microwave...not something I'd like to hear in restaurants."}
{"text":"The store is really cute.  Has some very cool mirrors and a few trays that are very decorative.  The restaurant is small.  Just 10-12 tables.  The service was great.  The food was OK.  Went for lunch, and tried to try a few things.  The empanadas were just OK.  They had some interesting sounding mixes but they were just ok. I had some peanut pumpkin soup that was the best thing I tried.  They did have a few veggie items, which I always appreciate.  Overall a fine stop for lunch, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Lovely, refreshing food, though the menu gets a bit old. Perfect, unique salad dressing. Must try it!"}
{"text":"I'll eat here again and write an update, to make sure I'm being fair.  So far, though, I'm sort of unimpressed, and I wanted to be impressed.  I ordered takeout from La Feria, and the first thing I noticed when I called was the person on the other end picked up and said \"Lah-FEERiya!\"  Now, I'm no stickler for authenticity, but ain't nobody in Peru EVER pronounced it that way.    I got an order of empanadas, and they were sort of small and just not very delicious.  I paid way more for them than I felt I should have.  The menu is also sort of uninspiring.  I feel like if you're going to do an ethnic food that isn't well-known by Americans, you should offer a lot of options so they can really get introduced to it properly.  I really like the idea, though.  It's a cute idea, and properly executed, it's the kind of place I could grow to love.  I'll do this place again, if I can convince anyone to go with me (I've had trouble talking folks into going here instead of somewhere else) but so far, I'm not awfully thrilled by it."}
{"text":"Just had a fantastic lunch here.  Food comes out quickly and is all super flavorful.  I had the special civeche chicken special (cooked chicken with onions, cilantro and lemon juice), my husband had the ropa vieja sandwich and my 2 year old had the black bean plate.  We all shared and loved every bite- especially the rice. My 2 year old could not get the rice and beans in her mouth fast enough!  As an added bonus they have a little shop to look through while you wait for your food.  The things are imported straight from Peru.  They had everything from awesome jewelry made from orange peels to hand made blankets."}
{"text":"Summary: friendly neighborhood Peruvian eatery + gift shop.   La Feria occupies the floor above the Pamela's in Shadyside. It does not have a large foot-print, and half of it was devoted to the souvenirs.  This leaves little space for the dining venture.   The restaurant offers only a small menu, but the price is reasonable and the portion generous. For what you pay, the food tastes pretty good too. I do sort of wish that my empanadas were fresh out of an oven rather than a microwave.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"La Feria truly has very, very sweet employees. Everyone we spoke to was really just excellent and that boosted my review a star. But this place has a few things that made me a bit unhappy. Although there are vegetarian menu items, everything is very obviously prepared long before and heated up. The heating up process took an incredibly long time, so one might even think they were getting a made to order meal. Thankfully, everything was warm enough but it really did a number on the taste. The rice is bland. My frittata was bland. Even the lettuce was bland. Dressing didn't help.   The other problem I had was the description of the food vs. what you actually receive. My grandmother assumed she was getting a lentil soup and she instead received a plate of mostly rice with some lentils on the side. I ordered a potato and sundried tomato tortilla with egg and there was no tortilla in sight.. it was another plate of mostly rice with a small frittata on the side. Kind of disappointing! The beautiful items in the store and the interesting descriptions on the menu make you assume the food would be very flavorful and authentic but that is the furthest from the truth..."}
{"text":"Quaint stop above Pamela's on Walnut Street with fantastic service.   I had been wanting to try La Feria for a while, and finally made it in. The sweet potato chips were amazing and the ropa vieja was delicious.   I'd definitely stop by again for lunch!"}
{"text":"Eating at La Feria is a pleasant experience which is why I go there every other week or so. That being said I've never ordered things from the menu but rather chose one of the special options. Their sweet potato fries are good and go well with the limeade.  My advice: stick to the specials menu!"}
{"text":"Not necessarily your traditional Peruvian food establishment, but the food is quite tasty and reasonably priced.  I had the empanadas (spicy beef and spinach & feta), they were quite good.  There are also at least 2 vegetarian dishes on special daily.    They additionally have tonz of beautiful Peruvian art for sale here.  Not exactly the cheapest, but very fine craftmanship.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"If you need a break from routine, this place will delight you with its flavors.   Their add-on hot sauce is real hot! And Cilantro pesto is very succulent chicken pieces in warm cilantro. The lemon garnished salad gives a tangy taste. All come together in 1 platter for $12. You can order wine with it.  Credit cards accepted."}
{"text":"Fabulous lunch if Epanades and salad...finished off with bread pudding and caramel sauce....."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! First time here and it's a small place. Couldn't find it at first because its above Pamela's. needs a sign!   Anyway, the food is incredible! I had the Triple Sandwich and it was WAY MORE than I expected. Taste is amazing. Sweet Potato chips were perfect. Definitely recommend it! :D"}
{"text":"This is the one restaurant in Pittsburgh my friends and I can always agree on. The specials never disappoint! The chicken is always cooked tenderly to perfection and the sweet potato chips are worth an order. It took me four years to find this place because the location is slightly obscure. I wish I'd found it sooner!"}
{"text":"Super yum! Came here with a party of 8 for my sister's graduation celebration, and got great service. I loved the arroz tapado, empanadas, and bright orange hot sauce!"}
{"text":"I came to La Feria on a visit to Pittsburgh after a night of... um, well... there was drinking. A not moderate amount of drinking. An amount of drinking that made me dumb enough to let my friend talk me into thinking I was rich enough to eat every snack provided in my hotel room mini bar but also made me smart enough (or feeling gross enough) to know I needed a healthy detox the next day.  My travel mate was driving and picked a nearby French place for breakfast and mocked my healthy eating option. I was not having it. I decided to be a picky little bitch and as soon as we were asked what we wanted to order at the French place I declined everything but a coffee. He threw a lil table fit, I had to laugh (because that's what he gets), and told him to calm his tits because he could still get whatever he wanted from the French place and I'm just gonna call in food at La Feria up the street and pick it up when the check came. It was definitely the longest route from point A to point B but I got what I wanted and seeing my friend have a conniption was the cherry on top.  I headed over to La Feria, which is located on the second floor of what is apparently another popular morning dining spot. I was a little confused at first because all I saw to begin with a retail store... a magnificent retail store with homewares art that were bold, colorful, and either in the form of animals or nudes, which is precisely my apartment aesthetic.   I didn't have a ton of time to shop but luckily, if you order food to-go, you have to walk through the restaurant to pick up your food and past all the retail goods and then to pay, you have to go back up to the retail register so technically a one stop shop for food and trinkets.   I scored two nominally priced driftwood carvings of an anteater and a leopard but if I'd had 10 more minutes I know I would have walked out with an exponentially larger receipt.   For food I got their recommendation with a Peruvian black bean salad that had more fixins than salad, which is exactly how I dig my salads. There was a very light dressing. lots of quinoa, pine nuts, cranberries, and more. It was light, fresh, and made me feel at least a little better about my health situation than if I'd pigged out on crepes."}
{"text":"Had the beef tapdo and it was delicious. Tasted fresh and was different. I also had the Peruvian coffee and it was tasty.  I would definitely come back. Coworker had the beef empanada and loved it."}
{"text":"The sweet potato chips are the best ever. The specials on any given day of the week will be most delicious and inexpensive. Love the salad and the house dressing. The vegetarian sandwich is the bomb, so is the beef sandwich. I'd pretty much motor boat that entire menu if I could."}
{"text":"One of my fav places to eat.  As a vegetarian, there is always something for me to eat.  Try the limeade...its amazing.  Their ahi hot sauce is also awesome.  I always buy a bottle on my way out.  A great hearty meal.  A must try."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh is a funny city. There are fantastic high end restaurants (e.g. Tamari, Spoon, 9 on 9, 11, etc...), but not so many medium-to-low-end restaurants. Well, La Feria is the clear exception. For $15 (or less) you can have an amazing Peruvian meal.   My wife and I are experimenting with vegetarianism (I know, we're missing out on a lot of yummy meals!), and La Feria is particularly great for us. They always have 2 veggie specials that are great. Last night I had this bean and pumpkin dish which was fantastic.  The atmosphere is pretty laid back and the staff are friendly, so for a quick and tasty dinner, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night around 9 pm with my boyfriend and my parents, who were staying at a nearby B and B.  We wanted to go somewhere both casual and inexpensive, and La Feria definitely is both of those things.  We almost didn't find it - it's upstairs above Pamela's.  Pamela's was closed of course, but all the lights were on, and we eventually figured out to ascend the staircase and seek out La Feria.   There was only one other table of diners, so it was very quiet in the eating area.  There are about 15 tables, and there are boldly colored Peruvian crafts everywhere you look!  We all decided to order lemonade and limeade, which was a great choice.  The drinks were refreshing and fresh, not too sour or too sweet.  I ordered one of the daily specials, which was chicken in a spicy peanut sauce.  It came with white rice, a green salad (with two kinds of cheese, two tomatoes slices, an olive, red onion, walnuts, and light dressing), and two slices of French bread.  The chicken itself was great - the sauce had a delicious peanut flavor and it went wonderfully with the rice.  I really liked the salad as well because the dressing was flavorful and I looooove cheese.  The bread was pretty standard, so I used it for dipping in leftover peanut sauce.  Nom!  My boyfriend got the ropa vieja sandwich, which I tasted.  Not as much meat as I'd like, but it was very juicy and flavorful.  Also the sweet potato chips that came on the side were totally addicting!  For dessert, we had a few shortbread cookies with what seemed like dulce de leche on them.  Everyone really enjoyed their meal.  It just feels like a good place to spend your money.  It's small, it's cheap, it's interesting food, and all their crafts are lovely and very affordable.  I think we'd be happy to go back if we were ever in the neighborhood.  I really want to taste those empanadas...."}
{"text":"Tl;Dr: Food was alright but the decor, store, and staff are really nice.  Food: I got a 1/2 sandwich + salad option. I ordered the ropa vieja sandwich and added their egg salad. The beef was tender and soft/juicy so the bread absorbed some of the flavor which is one of the best part of these sandwiches. I thought both the egg salad and the sandwich weren't as flavorful as they could have been.  Store: It is part gallery, part restaurant so it makes for an interesting dining experience. You're surrounded by colorful fabric as well as interesting little trinkets that the owner brings back from Peru. The place itself lets in a lot of natural light which is definitely my thing.  Service: The lady at the front/cashier made small talk with us as we were leaving and really seemed to put effort into getting to know her customers. She knew who were regulars and who weren't and asked us to see how we found out about the store. The other servers were also really nice but there wasn't as much interaction with them."}
{"text":"funky little cafeteria atop a very popular pittsburgh breakfast spot. it's BYOB - always nice - and the food is abundant and tasty. very casual, small menu, good, attentive service. plus they have a little shop with peruvian gifts, including an incas vs. spanish chess game, fluffy mini-llamas, and bright woven goods."}
{"text":"3.5/5  Very cute spot.  It also sells art crafts and super super very super soft alpaca items.  But on to the food as we ordered a lot of interesting items.  Limeade:  just like a lemonade but it's fun and different with the lime   Chicken empanadas:  flaky and soft.  The filling was good but I thought the chicken was a little dry.   Sweet potato chips:  these chips were crispy, thin, and light.  It came with some kind of a dipping sauce, cheesy... ricotta like? I'm not sure but I enjoyed it very much for its freshness.  Entrees:  veg and chicken special.  Now I wasn't too crazy for either items.  The chicken was dry, lacking of flavor, and almost kind of rubbery? I would say the veg dish wasn't very interesting as it had almost all the same side dishes as a non-veg meal (salad and rice).  It ended up being a tomato, cheese sauce on top of baked potatoes.  I think everything but the entrees were delicious.  Torta de chocolate:  mmmm yes I liked this very much :) soft, moist, ya know all the good things you enjoy with a piece of cake.  I really liked the raspberry compote drizzle on top.  I've never had Peruvian food before, but to be honest I don't think this was a good representation of it.  Something was lacking in the entrees but all other things were very tasty."}
{"text":"I really love this joint. It is small and casual. The menu changes regularly, and there is always a vegetarian option. I'm surprised it isn't more crowded because I can't really thing of a negative thing to say about the place. The salad is yummy, and I'm not even a salad person. I think my favorite dish here thus far has been the Peruvian corn. The atmosphere is cozy with a little shop in the front."}
{"text":"it is not unusual to find me at LaFeria once or twice a week. It is one of the top few places in Pittsburgh to have a casual lunch or dinner that is guaranteed to be delicious every time. I have convinced almost every member of my friends and family to dine here and now they crave it too! The daily specials are fantastic, but my old faithful is the La Feria salad with Turkey and a heaping pile of sweet potato chips. I have never ordered anything here that I have not loved. The service is very casual but friendly, and are very accommodating for BYOB needs. The cafe also doubles as a shop with a lot of really fun items to peruse after your meal. I cannot say enough good things about this place, it is a Pittsburgh treasure!"}
{"text":"I really wish there was some place like this closer to cleveland. A fair trade shop with a cafe type restaurant, I can dig it. Its located on the upstairs, peruvian art adorns the walls and is for sale, they also have some clothes and these beautiful blankets that I seriously want. I wasn't feeling too great so I just ordered the three empanada platter and split it with my boyfriend. I picked the egg/cream cheese/green onion, spicy apple, and beef empanadas. I wish I was hungrier because it was so tasty! Boyfriend got the ropa vieja and it came with a salad and rice... very very good. The girl that waited on us was super sweet too. Ending check was $25, not bad at all."}
{"text":"Can't emphasize enough how great this place is. It makes me sad that everyone goes to Pamela's when La Feria is right above it - I always go here for breakfast/brunch and am always extremely satisfied.  It's a great environment: La Feria, in addition to a restaurant, also acts as a Peruvian shop. They sell clothes, toys, and even amazing chess sets. The seating is cozy, the people are friendly, and the food comes out pretty quickly.  Speaking of food: It's fantastic. You'll pretty much always want to get one of the specials; each day they have a meat special and a vegetable special, but both are always great. The special (which usually consists of meat and vegetables) comes with garlic rice, salad (with onions, tomato, olives, cheese, and walnuts), and French bread. It's $10.95, which might be a bit expensive, but it'll definitely fill you up, and every bite will be delicious. Maybe you'll even have some to take home!  If you don't get one of the specials, go for the ropa vieja - beef slow-cooked with tomatoes. Still $10.95, still comes with rice/salad/bread, still delicious.  Bonus: La Feria has great Peruvian coffee!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! My friends and I were initially in line for the diner downstairs. The wait time wasnt too bad, but I had to leave to catch a flight soon so we decided to check out this restaurant instead. The waiter was so kind and took the time to explain the menu to my friends and I. I got the 1/2 Sandwich + soup of the day combo. Got the ropa vieja sandwich and the soup of the day was chicken and veggies. Soooo delicious! Just what I needed on a snowy day in the Pittsburgh. Also got a chicken and cilantro empanada, which is their signature empanada. The chicken and cilantro inside was perfect and the empanada crust itself was flaky and golden. So glad I got to try this place!"}
{"text":"Just finished another great dish from La Feria, black bean and rice casserole with fried bananas on top - one of their vegetarian daily specials. The fried bananas added a perfect sweetness to this dish, balancing the heaviness of the black beans and rice. Did I detect a little spiciness in the casserole too? I love this little Peruvian destination, and it's certainly a great place to pick up a healthy, fresh lunch. A little underrepresented, and I can understand why this place is often confused with a souvenir shop (probably because the decor is devoted souly to Peruvian paraphernalia...that you can buy). I highly recommend going regardless."}
{"text":"Wonderful Peruvian empanadas and lovely atmosphere. Above Pamela's restaurant. Really a gem."}
{"text":"I lived a good 4 blocks from La Feria during grad school and loved every second of it. Yes, Pamela's is downstairs and, if you can avoid drooling at the thought of chocolate chip banana pancakes, crepe style you can enjoy the best of peruvian food- pumpkin, peanut, and sweet savory tastes. You can get meat, vegetarian or a combo of both (which is always what I ended up with). Delish salad to accompany and bread to take those last swipes of sauce off your plate. Everything is great with an Inca Kola- and maybe even better with the Peruvian mirror you've been eying up on the wall.  Oh, and they do TO GO, which saved me on my walk home from the bus!"}
{"text":"Mediocre dishes. You can't call yourself a Peruvian establishment and not serve ceviche. This embarrassment of a menu is not Peruvian cuisine. Hint: Half the food selection is Cuban.   Still on the hunt for Authentic Peruvian food in Pittsburgh... Having no luck."}
{"text":"I got the tortilla de papa with the tortilla of the day. It was DOPE AF. It was really good. Our waitress was super nice and helpful, but not overly attentive to the point that it's annoying. Perfect amount of attention. There's also a bunch of cute knick-knaky things around to buy if you want. Definitely looking forward to coming back again with my old lady."}
{"text":"I am obsesed with La Feria. It feels like grandma's home cooked meals. Every entree is amazing, filling, and tastes like zero preservatives and artificial flavors you get at other places. I love geting the combination platter that comes with two specials or entrees, salad, and toasted french bread. Although the prices are a little bit high, the portions are quite large and I always leftovers. I would definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for some latin flavor without the chain tex mex."}
{"text":"I've had pretty good dishes here. The flavors are varied and unique, and the fare is light and healthy. They offer a good variety of vegetarian options and lunch specials.  I wish they didn't close so early. The atmosphere is also a little weird - its kind of like dining in a knitted-clothing store. Once you get past all of that, its a nice experience. Authentic? Who knows. I've yet to go to Peru. In the meantime, I'll keep enjoying the food they serve here."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great concept! There were some menu items that would appeal to those who might not be comfortable ordering something \"Peruvian\" but that is balanced by other items that are more ground in Peruvian authenticity. I ordered the Pollo a la Bahía which was a special -- I was quite pleased with my meal.  The shop part of La Fería had some great handmade Peruvian pieces that, although I didn't purchase now, I would be interested in going back in the future to buy."}
{"text":"This is a a good interesting spot.  It's located on Walnut above Pamelas.  I don't recall ever having Peruvian food before, but will definitely try again.  It's a small place where everyone seems to know each other.  The specials change weekly and are a good deal for $10.  The service is friendly and the portions are appropriate.  We started yesterday with sweet patatoe chips (I think) with some type of dip.  It was very good and a nice change for a first course.  I  had the chicken and rice cooked in cilantro which was really good.  The cilantro really gave the dish a crisp fresh flavor.  The limeade was delicious and gave me an appropriate mid afternoon sugar buzz.  It's a good discovery and a unique place to take your out of town guests."}
{"text":"Not bad as a basic lunch spot, at least if you don't mind iceberg lettuce, but it's not even remotely authentically Peruvian.  One or two dishes sound more or less on track, but the vast majority of the offerings are just unadulterated run-of-the-mill American.    And in fact, \"ropa vieja\", which they feature, is actually a Cuban dish and definitely not Peruvian. Latino cuisines are very far from interchangeable.    I won't even go there any more if I can avoid it because it's not even wonderful for American food; there are just too many better options around these days.    I've spent a lot of time in Peru, all over, and with close Peruvian friends, plus I make Peruvian food at home from some really good cookbooks, and I know the cuisine well.    It is totally beyond me why people think this place is so great, even as an American restaurant. It's just adequate.   Plus, it's upstairs and not wheelchair accessible - or easy to get to even without a chair if you have any mobility limitations.  I'm so tired of inaccessible restaurants in this day and age that I'm automatically taking off at least one star for every one that isn't, especially when it *is* possible to make them accessible.  There *is* room for an elevator here - which would also make the bathrooms accessible for patrons of Pamela's.    So, one star off for lack of authenticity, one for being just average anyways, and the third for inaccessibility.  Sorry!"}
{"text":"The specials are amazing. This is the perfect place to pick up lunch and go. You can always trust that the food will be both filling and perfect. The vegetarian options are also flavorful and filling. My advice is go experience some Peruvian comfort food."}
{"text":"I really don't know where to start.  I went to La Feria for lunch today, my companion and I did not utter one word while there was food on the table.  We both started with \"Inca Cola\", a Peruvian \"Cream Soda\".  I'm not usually a soda drinker, but I felt like I should try something new.  It was unique, but a bit too sweet for my palate which isn't accustomed to drinking soda anymore.  We also split a sampler of their empanadas, which were amazing.  Perfect ratio of pastry to filling.  Perfectly seasoned fillings, perfectly cooked exterior that undercooked nor burnt.  For entrees, we both decided to get the \"pollo borracho\", BREAST OF CHICKEN BAKED WITH FRESH TOMATOES, OLIVES, CAPERS, AND WHITE WINE (from their website).  It came with a side of salad, rice, and french bread.  My companion paused after his first mouthful to say \"oh my god.  this chicken is amazing.\"  We didn't speak again until both our plates were completely empty.  The salad, rice, and french bread were what were expected, but the chicken.  Wow.  I don't know how exactly they bake it, but the chicken breast was even more tender and moist than most of the chicken thighs i've eaten.  Not dry, not stringy by any means.  Completely exceeded my expectations.  Prices were definitely reasonable, w/ the daily entrees topping out the menu at $10.50.  I also like the homey feeling I get while in there.  There were around five other parties, which I think is pretty good since it was before noon on a Saturday and Pamela's is right next door.  Highly highly recommended, I'll most definitely be back.  For sure."}
{"text":"What a wonderful gem of a restaurant!  I really enjoyed my time at La Feria.  I loved the casual and colorful atmosphere! The space is located upstairs from Pamela's restaurant.  The restaurant also has merchandise from Peru for sale all of which is fair trade merchandise that supports the crafters from Peru.  It was great to be able to browse the items for sale while my friend and I waited for our meals and afterwards while we chatted.  My friend recommended the limeade which is fresh squeezed and was very refreshing!  We shared the  Sweet Potato Chips which was served with a cold queso-type dip called \"Huancaina\" dip.  For our entrees, we each ordered the specials - one with chicken and the other with quinoa and peanuts and then we shared them.  The food was delicious and unlike anything I've had before in Pittsburgh.  The chicken dish was creamy and had a delicious array of spices, but wasn't hot spicy, just flavorful.  The quinoa dish was tasty and included cheese (fyi for vegans) but not a huge amount but it was warm and nutty - very satisfying.  I didn't buy anything on this visit, but I will plan on going back to browse the merchandise and support the crafters who produce beautiful work!"}
{"text":"The store (on the second level) is a combination of a cute artisan shop and a small restaurant. There seemed to be only two employees working at the restaurant. Both of them were very friendly, but our food took a long time to be served because one employee seemed to be in charge of preparing our food.   The sweet potato chips (appetizer) were delicious, although I wasn't a huge fan of the cheese sauce that came with it. I felt that the food (entrees) wasn't as special as I expected it to be. The rice was mediocre (some rice grains were very hard and too dry). My chicken in my entree was very delicious, but my sister ordered the same dish and her chicken was rubbery and tasteless. The salad was average (the lettuce was shredded by hand, so the pieces were very large). The fresh cheese sauce and pesto sauce accompanying my chicken entree were decent, but I probably wouldn't want to eat it again.   I understand that there weren't many employees, but my friend finished her water near the beginning of her meal and it was never refilled. Overall, the employees had a great temperament, but the service left something to be desired. I probably would not come back again."}
{"text":"La Feria remains one of Pgh's best restaurants -- consistently wonderful food, good value, friendly service.  Viva!"}
