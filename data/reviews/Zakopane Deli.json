{"text":"Good choice of food to go or eat-in in small area. Lots of Polish groceries. Regular customer"}
{"text":"Lower end deli option catering to eastern euro niche.  Like a low end \"denningers\" Not a great lunch option. Some small selection of what seems like economy euro options (cabbage rolls, cutlets, etc). Sandwich was not great in anyway.   Too bad was hoping for much better.  Will not return unless im looking for a specific euro product.  Not a lunch option IMO."}
{"text":"A tiny deli with lots of Polish goodies. The chicken cutlet sandwich was one of the best I have ever had. This place is a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"The place is tiny, really easy to miss unless you know where it is. The store overall is alright, typical Polish store but they have a wide variety of home-made meats and pasteries. It is pretty good."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I've been going here twice a week for the last 2 years since I moved into this neighbourhood purely for their freshly baked bread. Other than that they have a great selection of hot food available if you're after a hearty polish meal and they do a great meal deal for $8 that's 1 meat, 1 starch and 1 salad. Pretty tasty! I've also gotten some great homemade sauerkraut from their fridges. I'll continue going back here for sure."}
