{"text":"This bar STINKS!! - LITERALLY!

This is the stinkiest, slimiest, stickiest bar I've ever been to. If you are drunk enough to not use any of your sense, KAMs is your place."}
{"text":"Leading psychologists say that smells ring bells*. My bells were ringing hard last night when I went to KAMS because those smells filled my nostrils with visions of joy and wonder from my childhood. 

There is a popular drink served at this pub called the \"Blue Boy.\" It is tasty and good and sweet to the tongue. It dulls all the bad senses and electrifies the good ones. It instills confidence where there was none, and reinvigorates the soul. 

Now, that being said, utopias such as KAMS can become dystopias if you aren't careful. For one, avoid the basement around the end of October, because it can get pretty scary down there with all the halloween decorations. However when it's not halloween, the basement can be a heaven away from the heaven upstairs.

One suggestion is to start serving food. A Blue Boy sandwich, now that is something.

{"text":"Kams, HQ of Bros and Slags. This place sucks it smells like vomit and alcohol. Literally, I saw someone puke on the floor and rather the employees cleaning it up everyone stepped on it and smeared it around, I guess that's called teamwork. Also, I truly believe they only sell one type of beer, Kam's special ale, which is disguised as other taps. Worst of all bros flock to this place like it's their own personal lek. So if your looking for place to get hammered, drink on the street its cleaner."}
{"text":"Just walk by the place and be overwhelmed by the smell.  I've been in the place once and it is gross.  This isn't just an \"I hate frats\" thing or something either.  It has bad beer sticky floors and rude staff---though I must admit I understand why on the staff thing.  I can't imagine going to this place at a peak time.  

One only imagines how many evenings that end in sexual assaults have started in Kams."}
{"text":"Kam's is definitely an under age paradise. Most people (or should I say kids) there are under age, wearing almost nothing, basically having sex on the dance floor, and puking all over the place. I was a transfer student, and went there with some friends my first few weekends there. I definitely learned my lesson and never went back, although I was tempted with all the Real World people they have on random nights to draw in a crowd."}
{"text":"If you are going to KAMS, you should know what you are going to be getting into. Like everyone else said, wasted freshmen, disgusting bathrooms, bad smells. Recently voted as the best place in Champaign-Urbana to have a one night stand. So, if you know what are getting into, and want a night of debauchery, it gets five stars. If not, one star."}
{"text":"If you come to Kams expecting anything besides the most wild night of your lives, you shouldn't even bother walking through the door. If you want to see young, easy on the eyes, women with lots of side boob, this is the place for you. If you want cheap drinks and want to get drunk with young college guys and gals, this is the place for you. If you want to make out with hot young ladies on the dance floor, this is the place for you. If you're coming here with your snob suburb attitude and expect a spotless bar with relaxing music where no fun is ever had, you need to go back to Naperville and never come back."}
{"text":"Say what you will about the smell and atmosphere, I never had a bad time at KAMS.  Ugh the smell - just walk past in the daytime and you wonder why you ever set foot in there at night.  You have to be in the right mindset - to get drunk and have a good time.  If you are in the mood for that, you WILL have a good time.  But if you want to sit back and have a few beers and talk, then go to Murphys or Legends.

Small dance floor that's crowded when a good hip hop or pop song comes on, but the minute they play country or something slow, it gets empty as can be, til the next good song comes on.  KAMS is always filled with student athletes with the throngs of girls surrounding them.  Drinks are cheap - find a frat guy and he'll buy you drinks all night long in hopes you'll go home with him.  Cheap night out."}
{"text":"A must try once kind of bar for me. Had a great time here during the day after a bar scramble. Not so great at night when the typical crowd gets there. A little on the pale side for me. But when you get ranked by Playboy as a top college bar, you better have tons of drunk guys trying to hook up w/ slutty girls."}
{"text":"Came here 10 years after my graduation...and not much has changed.  It still smelled like vomit, stale beer, and service sucked.  After 5 mins in the bar, the nastalgia faded, and we went to a better bar with clean floors, and a decent beer selection."}
{"text":"Good College memories! They have decent drinks! Specially the blue guy! They have good themes different days, it's a nice small bar  and with a nice dance floor and a nice patio. The only nasty thing is that the floors are ALWAYS sticky, and it is a 50/50 chance that the bar will smell like puke! Other han that it is a decent bar!"}
{"text":"What an absolute dump.

Everyone who goes to Kams is underage. More likely to see a high schooler in Kams than a 21+ individual.
There's nothing redeeming about Kams - music is terrible but loud, food's poor, beers are bad, and worst of all floors are infamously covered in some gelatinous sticky muck from spilled beers and god knows what else."}
{"text":"Close your eyes, and think about your typical college bar. Now, take it a step further, and imagine a college bar that smells like urine, vomit, and trash mixed together. Imagine that same bar, but instead of the floor being dry, it is legitimately wet (like wet enough for trash to float).  On top of all of this, imagine hanging out at this bar with wasted freshmen, frat boys who want to sexually assault you, and girls that always spill their drink on you because they were trying to dance to the new chain smokers song, and it's only the 3rd time they have played it that night. Open your eyes, and ask yourself if this is the type of establishment you would like to go to?  Odds are that if you go/went to UIUC, and you are reading this review your answer is a resounding \"yes\"!"}
{"text":"If you come here expecting anything less than the notoriety of Kam's then don't go. If you come here expecting anything more than 1 star don't go."}
{"text":"I've only been here once for Campustown Challenge, and believe me, that was one too many. The smell, what is it? A strange and powerful brew of vomit, cheap beer, and poor life decisions. And just when you can't stand it anymore and want to leave, you find your shoes sticking to the floor. Yeah, I went, but the only good thing I got out of it was a wristband."}
{"text":"eww... if i was still a freshman... or if i loved the smell of throw up & the feel of sticky floors pulling my shoes off; then KAMS is the place to be. Of course this is one of the oldest campus bars, & alumni love it here, but they need to just realize that it has gone down hill very fast in the most recent years. The servers on more than one occasion have been to drunk to serve me let alone be working. & also on more than one occasion someone in my group has stepped in throw up. I will not miss this bar or ever return. Someone needs to mop it every once in awhile. I'll pass on this one & walk the extra half block to firehaus.. or actually id rather walk to any other bar but KAMS."}
{"text":"So, I come into Kams, and i've heard great things about this place. I've heard it's one of the greatest college bars, and boy, was i disappointed. I ordered a rum coke, and the bartender had the AUDACITY, to give me a whiskey coke. This bartender could not have been more rude and I have never been more disappointed. Awful bar."}
{"text":"Drinks. Lots of them. I remember walking up to the bar and honestly ordering 50 shots for groups of friends on a regular basis.

Yes, it's dirty. Yes, it's smelly. Yes there is some girl in a tube top trying to make out with you and/or puking. Hopefully the former before the latter.

College binge drinking at it's finest. Not that that is necesarrily a good thing.

I used to bartend there while I was in college, so I have to show it some love!"}
{"text":"If I had one night with someone in Champaign, someone from someplace far-far-away, one night to be a gentle soul's Virgil, no ... Beatrice, yes ...Beatrice, as he explores the graceful, yet sublime, spheres of heaven, our trek, our ascension would end here. KAMS is the Empyrean of Champaign life. Simply put, to experience KAMS is to be enveloped in all that is good, all that is beautiful, and most importantly everything that makes no sense to an ordinary human at all."}
{"text":"Ah Kams, a unique form of campustown blight that eclipses all other bars in its propensity for stench and spewing of both human and non-human scum. Please don't support this establishment...it gets enough support from the Greek hegemony, despite the fact it imposes a variety of ills on the nearby sidewalk and air. I still don't know how people manage to navigate the miasma with enough strength left to even open the door. I suspect it is facilitated by a uniquely potent protective layer of bright sienna self-tanner, tube tops, and Abercrombie polos."}
{"text":"This place is a nightmare. Imagine yourself being surrounded by everyone who makes you wonder who fell asleep at the wheel in the admissions department, and all of these people are obscenely drunk and really want you to understand this fact. There is nothing redeeming about this place. The music is really really shit, not even ironic shit but honestly shit. I can't even review the drink selection because I gave up after trying to fight through a 5-deep wall of \"bros\" probably trying to get some roofied rum and coke for some poor underage girl wearing a misguided sequined top with pancake foundation and caked on black eyeliner. AWFUL!

Plus someone told me once that a girl got syphilis of the foot from wearing flip flops here."}
{"text":"20,000 watts of awesome.


Note: This review only applies to August 2006 - May 2007.  Whatever may have transpired at this establishment before or after that time has not been taken into consideration.  This time period is considered by the majority of scholars to be the Golden Era of Kams.

{"text":"If you like puke, and freshmen, and freshmen puking, come here. The only time I'm ever here is during a bar crawl."}
{"text":"Worst. Bar. Ever. Find someone to buy you a pint of crappy Canadian whiskey, and then take your money to Espresso Royale and give them the business whilst drinking on the sly. Now."}
{"text":"After seeing Jenna, Sarah and Melissa all give Kam's one star, I realized they are the most intelligent people reviewing Kam's and I had to follow in their footsteps. They're right - Kam's blows. It deserves ZERO stars. 

You know how you can pin point freshman when they come to the UIUC? Bingo! They're toting around bright orange Illini Union Bookstore bags. Same goes to the people who wait in line at Kam's. The majority are freshman. Underage drinkers who can't hold their liquor. Screw that.

Some drunk guy peed on my foot here. True story. I was only eighteen and not proud to be in the bar.

You can find cheap drinks with \"attractive\" and coherent people almost anywhere else in Champaign Urbana. LOOK!"}
{"text":"Beyond disgusting. I have never been here, nor will I EVER go. I've stopped walking down that street because the stench is so repulsive that I just can't take it. 
If I have to walk down Daniel street, I walk down the other side of that street. Still, I can still smell the horrible stench. Very low class joint, filthy, loud, and repulsive."}
{"text":"Kams. Smells like a hamster cage in serious need of a bedding change. Drinks are totally average, albeit cheap. The first place townies and U of I students go when they turn 19, most of whom regret it."}
{"text":"It's dirty, it's smelly, it upsets my belly. Actually though, this is my least favorite bar on campus. You can smell it from a mile away, and not like how you can smell Hollister from a mile away because that shit smells amazeballs compared to Kam's. The songs are as corny as the fields, and the songs are hardly worth busting a move for. Sorry not sorry, ain't a fan."}
{"text":"DJ sucks....literally just a MacBook plugged in to a speaker. The toilet paper is always nonexistent.  Smells like someone died. Frat boys are annoying a

My friend rang the beelll 

The blue guys aren't very blue"}
{"text":"One star is too much. I haven't been to Kams since I went to college. I went there for the memories. I told one of the bouncers and he put my group in the VIP line. When I got to the front with my group he acted like he had no idea who I was. This was humiliating at best. Kams sucks and we will never go back."}
{"text":"Okay, to all you naysayers, here is my rebuttal.

1. Of course the K-Rock is full of underage drinkers. COLLEGE is full of underage drinkers, particularly when you only have to be 19 to get into bars. Do you think everyone who goes to Brothers or Murphy's is 21? NO!

2. Sure, the place is dirty. So you just have to use your logic when you go there. Don't drink draft beer (we have all heard the Kams tapeworm rumors), shove extra TP in your purse or pocket during your first bathroom trip for use later, wear shoes...

3. People being hammered, making out on the dance floor, dressing like sluts...this is all part of college. If you didn't do it while you were there, I pity you. I spent four nights a week in this place for four years and never once did I vomit, get vomited on, or see someone vomit in this bar. And, frankly, if I had, I wouldn't have cared because I was less concerned with judging other peoples' poor life decisions and more concerned with making my own.

Kams was, bar none (no pun intended), my favorite bar over the course of my four years in Champaign (2001-2005). Yes, I was in a sorority, so go ahead and keep making snide Greek comments. I get the stereotypes, and I know plenty of people who perpetuate them. But I was an Accounting major, graduated with a GPA above 3.5, and also partied my ass off at Kams. When I say I'm well-rounded, I mean it. :)

At any rate, Kams has a great outdoor area, super cheap drinks ($1 can get you ten shots if you play your cards right with the bartenders) and a fun crowd. Always photo opportunities with football and basketball players. Dee Brown may have been super creepy, but he was fun to party with. 

There is a dance floor, but it is mostly reserved for freshmen to grope each other before heading back to the Six Pack to have clumsy blacked-out relations. 

And if anyone remembers the Kams Taps Tournaments--so sad that these are gone, but some of my fondest (lack of) memories from college took place during those tourneys.

I'll be at Kams on October 11th for Homecoming--I invite you naysayers to meet me there and I will show you what Kams is really all about! :)"}
{"text":"This bar is the scummiest fucking shithole at UofI. Its littered with garbage vomit and broken glass. The answer to good for kids should be are you kidding.

Went there to party, fun, but the establishment itself sucks. I ate a hotdog that they grill outside because they smelled great. Regretted that in 4 hours.

Dont go here until someone buys it again its really a piece of shit"}
{"text":"If you find yourself having to wash your clothes as soon as you get home from the bar, it's probably best that you stay away from that bar altogether.  That about sums up my experience with this staple on-campus venue."}
{"text":"This sucks. Staff is horrible they sexually harassed me and are soooo rude. It is NOT good for kids. It is horrible and so ratchet nobody should go. The bartender 683 did this to me and said he didn't care. Not okay"}
{"text":"What a dump. The place smells awful, everyone who works there is a jerk and terrible server, the only reason anyone ever goes there is for Block so they have a place to drink. Block is fun regardless of where it is so this creates a vicious cycle of people thinking they liked Kams because they had fun at block, even though Kams had nothing to do with it. For the love of God never go in the basement or bathrooms here."}
{"text":"I think I first went to Kams about 30+ years ago and when I made my most recent visit this past weekend with my niece for \"Dad's Weekend\" all of the memories came rushing back with that first hit of vinegar & piss that assualts your nose as soon as you make it around the corner.

Inside, same sticky floor and river of piss in the men's room, despite the early hour (suspect leftovers from previous night).

Still, it is an institution and if you can score a \"Blue Guy\" from the bar and handle the ear-splitting volume of a dozen crate speakers, you'll have a synapse-snapping memory of your first college bar.

Anybody expecting better from a campus bar missed their exit...3 hours north near Evanston..."}
{"text":"I didn't go here at all until I was a senior, and had discovered the wonders of country night. On this night (Tuesday!) you'd go, pay $5 and get a mason jar to fill with beer for $1.50. You only ever had to buy the jar once and could bring it back again and again every single week. My friend Bob and I would go, drink buckets (or jars, whatever) or Miller Lite, and watch \"Married With Children\" on TV.

And then I realized that the KAM'S bartenders have decent memories, and so long as you aren't asking them for big fancy drinks with lots of parts, they'll remember you and your face and your drink. If you tip them nicely, they'll have your drink waiting for you when you return to the bar. Or maybe that was just me, I can never be sure. Hell, maybe I stole someone else's beer.

Regardless - it's a dirty, dumpy little dive full of underdressed, underaged children with popped collars and excessive skin-baring. And DESPITE all this, and DESPITE its sticky floors and weird clientele, I still really enjoyed myself every single time I was here.

YAY KAM'S!"}
{"text":"Oh my god. This place smelled worse than socks, puke, and spilled beer everywhere! You cannot pay me to drink here. A few years back I came with a friend and took shots and left quickly but I did not notice the smell as much.... ahhhhh"}
{"text":"A UofI alum took me here when I was 20 and itching to go to 19+ bars. We hit this place up first, as it is apparently quite a popular place. I was disgusted, and even more so when my alumni, a former PKA told me he and his brothers peed while in their chairs at the bar.

The place stunk. The drinks were worse and painfully weak. I was horrified to see people in formal wear. Guess they were pre-gaming it there?

Ladies...pass this one up. You can do better!"}
{"text":"I went here once circa 1994, and it was nasty even by cheap-drunk undergrad standards. I had no idea this barf rodeo was still open until I drove by it last summer on a warm night with my windows down; I could smell the damn place from my car as I drove by. Fcking gross."}
{"text":"I will first start out by saying that, of course a college town bar is going to be full of underage people (especially in a town when 19 year olds are legally allowed in bars!!!)!!!!  Who are you people giving these stupid reviews?!?!    

Well, I went back to campus this weekend for the Michigan-Illinois game.  Wow, this bar is more disgusting than ever (I think it gets worse and worse every year - or maybe I get older and older every year and have less tolerance for grossness...)!  When you first step foot into the bar, your feet just stick to the floor.  Do they ever mop???  If your shoes aren't sticking to the floor, they're in an inch of piss/booze/broken glass etc.  I saw a girl laying flat on her back with her hair and skirt in the gross wet mess, and she had lost a shoe.  EWWW.

Just get some toilet paper in the ladies room stalls!"}
{"text":"Five dollar cover? Are you joking?
This place is a hellhole and a sorry excuse for a classic college dive bar."}
{"text":"A place I would rather give negative stars to.  This place sucks.. I have no idea why it's even popular!  Full of underage girls... with three crappy beers on tap (Bud Lite, Miller Lite, Coors Lite).  Bad dance floor because nobody is dancing.  Oh.. and there is a cover.  Why you would pay to go somewhere that sucks?  I have no idea.

And I think it kind of smells.

If this is what sorority girls and frat boys like to give their money to... they must be really stupid."}
{"text":"Kams represents everything that college represents; debauchery, dirt cheap drinks, and FUN.  To the people who gave shitty reviews on Kams, do us all a favor and don't come back because we didn't want you there in the first place!  Go hang out at the Undergrad library, or better yet the Union cafeteria on a Friday night...now those people know how to party!  Ever wonder why you can't get laid?  Because you are a NERD"}
{"text":"I honestly was a huge fan of kams and came every time
I was on campus. The fact that they charge cover any night is asinine. I tipped the DJ to play my favorite song and he never played the song. I dropped some cups on the ground (Everyone was throwing cups on the ground once they were done with them) and bar manager was an asshole on 9.21.17 and threatened to kick my ass among other threats and threw me out even after I offered to pick up the cups. I was there with a good friend of mine and as I was walking out of the bar, defeated, they said I quote \"and your girlfriend is ugly\" which was completely uncalled for as she took place in 0 cup dropping. I will not be back when I'm on campus and I honestly hope that the manager is fired as he was extremely disrespectful. Kams was an institution but it's turned into a bar where little sophomores with daddy issues that have been given too much power can thrive and treat alumni like they don't make a difference for the university. Good riddance."}
{"text":"If you like the smell of puke, this place is for you!  The manager is a real treat too."}
{"text":"Just for the location (across from Thetas), you get 5stars.

Getting a theta to drop her book for 30 min for a beer across the street is an easier task because of the short bar crawl.

I miss Kams and for all you mother scratchers there for the summer, I wish I were you!"}
{"text":"Rarely am I rendered speechless. However KAMS did it to me. These people we met at the football game randomly invited us. Even though my friends warned me, we went anyway. There is a distinct smell that hangs over this establishment like a proud banner, a beacon to the faithful. I had to alternate holding my breath and chugging in order to somehow banish the smell from my nostrils. I drank a Ed Hardy beer, which I didn't even know they made, because they were out of Corona and when will I ever be able to say again that I drank a Ed Hardy beer? (Obviously I am a beer connoisseur.) (It wasn't terrible.) All the games were on, the music was surprisingly good, and I did really have a good time. The guys were also buying shots, which helped a lot. I'd come back again, just for the LULZ."}
{"text":"Worst bar I've ever been to. I go to IU and was in Champaign for work. Went out one night and ended up at Kams unfortunately. The only people at the bar were employees, which should have been the first sign to leave. The \"bouncer\" was at the bar drinking and asked us for our IDs and was clearly drunk. The bar tender had the worst attitude and was too focused on socializing with the other drunk employees. The drinks were HORRIBLE. I don't know why you would try and serve a double rum and coke in a 9 oz cup, but he did. Had a problem telling me what a \"blue boy\" drink was. When I ask what a blue boy is and the response is \"a drink\" I kind of look at you like a moron. I don't even want to get started on the week old vomit smell filling the bar. Will never be back. If you want a decent bar experience, go to Firehaus around the corner. Don't let the \"$1 Well Wednesday\" sign fool you."}
{"text":"Are you a sensible, intelligent human being?  Are you older than 19?  Does your clothing generally obscure your breasts/underwear/genitals from plain sight?  Are you averse to fist-pumping?  Does the pungent odor of beer-tinged vomit make you nauseous?  

Well, then, welcome to KAMS - your personal hell."}
{"text":"Honestly, one star is too elevated a rating for this charmless, execrable dump.  My friend and I never got around to it in our undergraduate years, but we decided to give it a go on our \"reunion\" tour thirty years later.  What a mistake.  It only goes to show that PT Barnum was right and euthanasia may have untapped possibilities.  Grimy, foul-smelling, and lacking any décor -- and those are its good points.  A pox upon it."}
{"text":"Kam's is one of the best bars in the world.  

20,000 watts of nightly sound, free shuttle bus, and darts help to make Kam's the #2 pregame party spot in the nation.

Upon stepping into Kam's, you are greeted with a familiar neighborhood crowd and the aroma of fresh, tasty beer being poured.  A sophisticated, happy-go-lucky crowd draws you in and the fantastic selection of drinks will make you stay.

The basement is fantastic for parties and the staff is very knowledgeable.  The free popcorn is of gourmet quality.

All in all, Kam's is a wonderful place to bring a date or just have a night of wine-drinking."}
{"text":"If you went there and are nostalgic for what Kam's is, you already know you like it. For everyone else, go once to say you went, but that's it. it smells horrible, your shoes stick to the ground, there's broken glass everywhere that they don't clean up, it's wall to wall people: so basically a huge fire hazard. Basically it's a college bar, so if you like that kind of thing, go for it."}
{"text":"All time favorite bar on campus! This bar was rated in Playboy (haha) as one of the top campus bars! It's always extremely rowdy, probably too rowdy for me these days. It's not a nice bar by any means, more of a place to go with your friends in college to drink for cheap."}
{"text":"Ok. The two stars are because the floors had many sticky diseases on it. WTF? Don't they clean the floors? But the bartenders did make me forget about the nastiness with the strong and cheap drinks. That was the only reason it didn't get one star. I'd go back if I'm in Champaign again."}
{"text":"You know there's a problem when you've never been in this campus bar, but your 60-year-old father has read about it in Playboy and shouts from the psych building across the street: \"THERE'S KAMS! WOW!\" So then, of course, he wants an up-close view of it even though it's butt early in the morning and there's really nothing to see. Half asleep, you agree, trot across the street and then remember that overwhelmingly volatile vomit smell... All day, every day."}
{"text":"Worst bar I've been to, period. It looks awful, smells awful, and the nastiest, warmest beer on tap that I've ever drank came from KAMS. On top of that, the clientele are awful, too, unless you're looking to meet the most obnoxious people in the whole city when they're in full bar crawl mode."}
{"text":"I have also never been inside Kam's, and that is causally related to the reason I can still give it one star:  I have to walk by its vomit stench lined exterior every fucking day during school to get to the psych building, and on unofficial I have to endure having riot police stationed in the lobby of my building to prevent the kam vomit and mayhem flow from infiltrating the psychology building.  

The vomit smell is even there at like 8AM on Tuesday mornings!  When I was in college, I went to bars that didn't card too, but on the real I still don't understand why anyone would go to kam's."}
