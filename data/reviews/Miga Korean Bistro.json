{"text":"My favorite Korean restaurant so far. The food is well seasoned, decent portions and a great comfort. The bistro is small and intimate. Perfect for small parties or a causal date. The menu is a fusion of traditional  Korean and Hawaiian twists. I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for great Korean BBQ, this is the place. The kalbi is awesome, the chicken BBQ delicious, and the kimchi of course. I'm looking forward to the soft tofu soup next time!!"}
{"text":"My first impression of Miga is a Korean fast food restaurant with reasonable price. Price was very reasonable but many varieties of menu. I tried cold noodle and rib combo, less than 10 bucks for both! In Los Angeles we pay about 10 bucks just for cold noodle. I will come back for sure next time in vegas, win or loose."}
{"text":"My family and I love their soft tofu soup and kalbi BBQ ribs. Their staff is so friendly. I will definitely return to this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"My family had a hard time deciding what to order and the owner, Nike, was very patient in explaining the dishes to us. He and his wife are such nice people! We ordered the lunch special: bibimbap, kalbi, and bulgogi, and each came with a tofu soup. Lunch special is a fantastic deal, full sized portions (not half or lunch sized portions). Evette g was delicious and authentic, similar to the Korean restaurant at in LA. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"The best korean taste... home made cooking! Highly recommended and for sure we'll be back again sometime vety soon. There tofu soup is really undeniably tasty!!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Been craving Boba tea for a while and their Thai Boba tea really hit the spot!! Ordered the  (seafood tofu soup) and  (kalbi) and was filled with flavor!! Definetly the best korean food I've had in awhile. Also the service was great and every friendly employees! Would recommend trying and I'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is pretty new but it has immediately replaced my top spot for Korean food and soondubu. Service is great and the boss is so friendly and modest. Tofu soup is definitely the highlight, comparable to the greatest in L.A. And talk about a great deal, they have daily lunch specials with low prices and nice portions. Love everything!"}
{"text":"I'm always continuing my search for good Korean food as you'll see in my other reviews. I saw this new restaurant pop up on my Yelp and wanted to give it a try.  Being a new restaurant the place wasn't packed which was nice. My boyfriend and I walked in and we were given a stapled paper menu and also advised that there was a menu on the board. I'm not sure why the menu was separated.  The service was a bit odd as when we were ready to order we had to flag down the waitress as she was busy eating lunch but was the only waitress there. I get it, we all need to eat but it was unusual, but she was very nice.  We ordered the 2 item combo which comes with 3 choices of banchan. There wasn't a huge selection of choice banchan so I stuck with mainly kimchee items. The banchan can be chosen similar to a buffet style which I prefer.  My boyfriend had the chicken and kalbi which both were good and decent. We both had the sauce on the side which I always think is the way to go because sometimes sauces can kill a dish. He had the Mac salad as a banchan but it was very bland. The kimchee I had was good. I really liked the radish kimchee. It's your typical well fermented kimchee.  I had the boneless beef with the chicken as well and it was good/decent.  The marinade for the beef was not overwhelmingly sweet which I like and the sauce for the chicken wasn't too sweet at all but the chicken doesn't really need the sauce.  This is definitely a go to for fast Korean food if you're hungry and don't want to wait or want a formal sit down. The price is pretty good considering the portion you get as well as the banchan. I think it averages around $13-15. When I want quick Korean food at not a crowded place this will be my go to."}
{"text":"My FAVORITE restaurant for Korean food! Great quality food and service is awesome! I have tried a couple of different things from their menu and never have been disappointed. I definitely recommend to give them a try."}
{"text":"I ordered togo order from here..it gave them almost 40minute to prepare the food and delievered..they were missing my orders..and pluse i never received sauce and chopstick..they should at least put some soy sauce..but nothing inside...i was so frustrating .......no good experience..."}
{"text":"100% will be coming back here again for their authenticity. I love a place that knows how to prepare traditional dishes from appetizers - kim chee, mac salad, jap chae, bean sprouts, fish cake, and marinated jalepenos- to the main entrees, down to the hot tea/water.   Our group ordered the Miga Special 1 & 2, Meat Jun plate, and Bulgogi Bi Bim Bap. With the Miga Specials, the rice is separated from the meats that are atop of a bed of lettuce. The chicken and kalbi were cooked perfectly and the sauce gave us the just the right flavors that weren't too sweet or too savory. As for the Bi Bim Bap, I was completely satisfied with eating only half of that enormously portioned bowl. I also tasted a the meat jun and highly recommend that plate as well. The dishes were all pretty much the best compared to previous korean restaraunts I've been too.  The ambience is truly relaxing; lights are dimmed slightly and the music is not too loud or harsh. They have 4 televisions showcasing each of their dishes and 2 beautifully framed photos of South Korea's landscape. The restaraunt is also clean and organized, even their spoons are covered with sanitary sleeves. This is also a smoke free environment with free wi-fi! Not to mention they also deliver via Uber Eats and you can find them on social media (yelp obviously, facebook, instagram and twitter).   The workers are very sweet and accomodating. They catered to whenever we ran out of side dishes, rice, or beverage. Honestly this place is a tough one to pass by, you should definitely try it out!"}
{"text":"I don't know if this a fair review because I'm comparing with LA hwe dup bab (sashimi bowl - similar to poke bowl, but with Korean sauce).   I don't think I've ever had hwe dup bab that had the mixture it did... seaweed salad and I think pear slices? Was a little atypical. Seemed more like a Hawaiian styled poke bowl so was a bit disappointed. The sauce was a little too thick too, so it was hard to get a good mix going.  People at the restaurant are super cool and nice, but this 3 star is mostly due to the food. I know this place had really good monk fish stew(?) or agu jjim in Korean. I may have to try it now since ownership seems to be different."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new spot and I'm glad the hubby and I found this! First time and they were super nice! Food was delicious! Could be our new favorite Korean spot especially for their hot tofu soup. They got a good tip.  Would come back again!"}
{"text":"Really great food with my favorite korean flavors. Ordered delivery  and was very impressed with the seamless and efficient service. Would highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The food is so very incredibly good. Service is wonderful. I cannot stress how awesome little authentic Korean eatery it is.  Price is very reasonable for the huge portion and tons of side dishes served. They'll be seeing me for the years to come for sure."}
{"text":"Come here for classic Korean cooking and flavor! The seafood tofu soup can't be beat and arguably one of the best in town for me. Really hits the spot on a cold night. The Kalbi bbq has great flavor as well. Will definitely come back and try more interesting items on the menu.   Expect a classic mom and pop feel to the restaurant, so come here for your comfort food craving."}
{"text":"A while back I ordered from this restaurant and the food was great, especially the spicy beef soup.  I've been trying to order again but for some reason I can't find the right company that will pick up and deliver from them.  Today I'm going to go in person."}
{"text":"This place is a good and cheap option for lunch! Their lunch combos are around $9 which comes with meat and soup/noodles. Portions are smaller but enough for an average person for lunch, and you can't beat the price.   The place is nice and clean. We got water immediately, order was taken quickly and food came out quick too. They have some interesting dishes but I wanted to try the basic items first to see how those are before trying other items. I got the kalbi with seafood tofu soup (or beef soup), the kalbi came with 3 pieces and soup was a decent portion for one person. I was definitely full after finishing the combo. My sister got beef and tripe bone soup, she said it had a strange sour taste to it (not sure if that is how it is supposed to taste or something was wrong). We usually eat the bone soup at E-jo so this was different. The only complaint is that they only gave us 4 sides..another 1 or 2 sides would be nice.   Overall I would definitely come back here for lunch or dinner plus they have some interesting items that I want to try. Prices are not bad at all, a delicious and cheap option for lunch."}
{"text":"I guess before you judge the interior and water you should wait until your receive your food. My grandlittle and I decided to check this place out since we both wanted korean food. Upon arrival we were greeted right away.  When we got our water, we noticed a weird smell from the cups. It was so pungent we decided not to drink water at all. I ordered the beef soondubu (tofu soup) and my grandlittle got the kalbi (korean BBQ short beef ribs). For the side dishes you get kimchi, macaroni salad, bean sprouts, and etc. It didn't take long for us to receive our food.  Either I haven't had soondubu in a long time or I was just super hungry, but it was so good! I couldn't stop drinking it. I usually can never finish soup by myself, so I guess this means something. Customer service was very attentive. I can't wait to come back here to try something new."}
{"text":"Came down from Orange County to visit vegas and All I wanted was there spicy tofu soup. They don't disappoint when it come to the fresh food and service. Nice staff and clean environment to come and have a nice healthy bowl of soup before you hit the road. Will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"I come here to eat a few times a month with my co workers and I tell you what..the food is amazing! I have had a lot of Korean food in my time and this place is the best. A must try is the seafood tofu soup! So addicting! It's not just the food though. The owner \"Nike\" yes you saw that right \"Nike\" is always there to greet you. They make you feel like you are at home. Definitely recommend if you are craving Korean food!"}
{"text":"Ate here with the family, and was very impressed! The food is delicious, the people are friendly, and you are doing yourself a disservice by not checking it out! The cold Barley Tea is thirst quenching, and never ending. The tofu soup is real good. Squid and stir fried vegetables is also very fulfilling. I would share a picture of the dishes, but alas, we ate them too fast."}
{"text":"Great service! The Uber driver picked up the wrong food and Miga responded quickly to make it right. The owner personally dropped off our order at our house. Food is super good tasty. I recommend this spot to anyone with a Korean BBQ craving!"}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible bland and flavorless. Even Halmony (korean grandma) *who I might add can't  taste that well* hated it"}
{"text":"First time here.  The server is good and friendly, she stop and check our table couple times. The portion is big but the new menu higher the price.  There r 4 kinds of side dishes come with the order which can be refilled.  We order:  Bibimbop $10.99 It came in a large size that can be served for 2 people. The seaweed miso soup was salty.  Topokki $10.99 They cooked it too long that the rice cake tasted like smash potato. After we gave our opinion, they did told the kitchen."}
{"text":"Friendliest service ever! They treat you with warm welcoming. When I first walked in to this restaurant,  I didn't expect much but the owner and the staff was very respectful and kind. More often I go there, it seems my plate gets bigger and bigger. Their price is pretty reasonable. My favorite lunch plate is MEATJUN and my favorite stew is KIMCHEE JI-GAE. But MEATJUN and it's sauce is the best I had by far! It reminds me of home. (HAWAII) Oh! And....Their MANDOO (Deep fried dumpling) are also very good dipped into same the sauce as well. MEATJUN and MANDOO lovers go and try it out instead of taking my word for it. They use freshly sliced thin beef for MEATJUN, MANDOO is crispy on the outside and filled and moist in the inside. As for KIMCHEE JI-GAE, a lot of fresh pork shoulder meat if you ask kindly and go there often enough. Hehe. I go there at least once a day get my Korean food in."}
{"text":"This is a cute little Korean restaurant in Las Vegas. I came here with my family and everyone seemed pleased about the food. Myself included!  I got the beef soon dubu (tofu soup). I was a little disappointed with the meat because it was really stringy so I didn't eat too much. However, the flavor of the soup itself was really delicious. It was the right amount of spicy for me (maybe a hair too much). My sister's Korean boyfriend also said his was good as well.  I really liked the barley tea that they have here, both hot and cold. It goes so well!"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, courteous, and most of all DELICIOUS! Conveniently located and my new favorite for Korean food in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Hands down the best soondobu spot! It was our first time here and it's a quaint restaurant. Nothing too exciting with the decor. A sweet lady seated us immediately and asked what drink we'd like. She took our order as soon as we were ready. Overall, the service was great! They serve a variety of Korean food that you can choose from. Best part is they have an all-day special which, I believe, are less than $15 each. A combo comes with your choice of cold noodles or soondobu and of course banchan. I opted for their bulgogi and seafood soondobu combo. Soondubu is always a must for me everytime I hit up a Korean restaurant. Anyway, back to my order...The bulgogi was nicely marinated. And their soondobu was delicious!!! So delicious that I asked for one more bowl of rice (which I normally don't) just so I could finish up the whole bowl of soondubu! I asked for medium spice and it was perfect! The seafood/tofu/soup ratio was perfect. I'd definitely come here again. Mmmm, just thinking about it makes me want to go back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed, I ordered Oxtail Soup, and Beef Kalbi for delivery, unfortunately I got my order delivered to me 2 hours after I placed my order and I ordered at 11:00 am. Concerned since my lunch is now over and I still haven't eaten, I called Miga after one hour and half asking when am I going to receive my order? He then told me that I should blame Yelp delivery and use Uber eats next time.  When I got the food (2 hours later) First  of all it is now cold and taste is bland. The Oxtail soup has no taste, the meat is still hard, and the noodles is too soft and falling apart. and the Kalbi is just okay. It's not appetizing at all.  I will not order from this place again."}
{"text":"First time here.  The side dishes that we had were a pickled radish/cucumber/garlic combo, mung bean sprouts, soy sauce egg, and the standard kimchi.  Here is what we ordered:  Seafood tofu soup (soondubu) - For my taste, the soup was not spicy at all.  Could have used a little more spice, but it was probably my fault for not requesting for extra spicy.  The soup was tasty, there was a mix of calamari, shrimp, and a mussel.    Pork katsu - This is a large pork katsu that is served here.  The outside was friend to panko perfection while the meat inside was moist and delicious.  The katsu sauce is good without being overpowering.  Spicy bbq pork - I like this dish the most.  The pork had a good level of spice and had a lot of flavor.  I especially love the onions that sit on the hot plate when they get caramelized.  So good to get some porky goodness with that perfectly caramelized onion in a single bite."}
{"text":"I ordered the meat combination and found the chicken to be the frozen already cooked variety and it was still ice cold.  The sauce they put on it had no flavor at all.  My wife ordered a pork soup dish and only ate 3 bites.  Took forever to get the check.  Will never return."}
{"text":"This place has very good deal for lunch special: kalbi and Tofu soup with refill kim chi only for 8.99 The quality is good, the owner is very friendly , my first time here I'm  very surprised that this little place has such great food . I will come back again"}
{"text":"Get the monk fish stew and muhl neong myeon! The restaurant is generous with their proportions and gave me many pieces of fish in the stew. Give it a try here! Comfortable atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall. Good selection. Reasonable price. Soon du boo was a little oily but still tasted great! Kalbi was seasoned well and tender. Wish they had more side dishes."}
{"text":"Great Restaurant with amazing food . They offer delivery with EAT24 and GrubHub ... The food was delivered extremely fast on 12 miles from the restaurant ! Definitely will   Order again !! Thanks Miga Korean Bistro"}
{"text":"Very disappointed, I ordered kalbi combo with cold noodels for delivery, i got my order an hour after, then it doesn't have rice but it says it's served with two rice, I called the restaurant right away and asked them if I can get my rice, don't know what's his name but he said how do we deliver to u, I was like don't know, u tell me,he's like execatly, then told me to specific put at the memo to request rice next time I order from them. So I paid 23 including delivery fees n tips then get a combo with NO RICE!!!! Will not recommend this place not because of the food but the attitude."}
{"text":"Hubby was craving some cold noodle soup so we went searching on yelp and stumbled across this place. I ordered the soft tofu stew and it was definitely packing in flavor!! Our waitress was a sweet lady who was attentive to our needs. We will be returning"}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly people, and great price! I definitely plan to come back again!   The seafood tofu soup (their specialty) was phenomenal. Their Kalbi is very juicy. If you're looking for a flavorful and spicy kimchi that's not overpowering, this is the place.  The staff is friendly and was very helpful explaining the menu to us. The service was incredibly quick. I've been to many Korean restaurants across the US (LA, NYC, Chicago), and this is one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"BIBIMPAP! BIBIMPAP! BIBIMPAP!   Seriously one of the best Korean restaurants I've ever ate at. Bibimpap seems like such a easy thing to make, but it's really not. You can taste the difference of quality here. Every ingredient is flavored and cooked just right. They don't give you a ton or rice like other places.   OMG THE BANCHAN.   They make all their banchan in house. Some of the dishes rotate as well depending what the chef made that week. I got a chance to try some side dishes I never had before like fermented black beans. They also have some of the BEST KIMICHI ever, not too sweet and not too spicy.  If the owner ever reads my comment, please give my compliments to the chef.  You have a real gem on your hands."}
{"text":"Just have to say that this place is legit. Everything from the water to food is 100% Korean and I love every bit of it! If you're looking for good Korean food please come here and you won't be disappointed! The Miga special 2 is amazing !"}
{"text":"The boyfie and I have been on a tofu soup binge for the past several months so I bookmarked every single place that makes seafood soondubu. When we arrived I had a change of heart and ordered the nengmyun (cold noodles) which was the BEST decision ever. If you think the Vegas heat is unbearable, I highly recommend coming here for the cold noodles. So refreshing and so delicious.   The tofu soup took forever to come out, but it's ok because the service was great and the soup itself was tasty. Not the usual thick soondubu I'm used to, but I'm comparing it to the best of the best (located in Santa Clara, CA). I really liked all the banchan here. They serve soy sauce egg (one of my faves) and pretty decent kim chee.   I saw a lot of people ordering bibimbap and it looked REALLY good. They have a good variety of different types of Korean dishes here. Less than 3 miles from the strip and only 2 miles from where I stay near the Rio. This is probably our go-to Korean restaurant out of convenience. It helps that everything here is tasty too :)"}
{"text":"We use to love this place.  It was one of our favorite Korean restaurants in Vegas.  We often visit this establishment.  We have not had any issues previously and the food quality and taste have always remained consistent.  However, I can tell you after this one experience you've forever lost a loyal customer.   It was extremely clear that they cater specifically to certain people/groups.  Even though there were only two parties including ours it was blatantly clear we were an after thought.   Part of our order arrived shortly after we ordered.  20 mins passed we still haven't received the last entree.  Another 15 mins passed we finally waived the server down as the entire time she was catering to the other party and never took notice of our needs.  She confirmed that our order was complete which was quite confusing as we are still waiting for the order.  We explained to her what was missing and became quite shocked that she blamed us for ordering the wrong thing!! We thought we were quite clear when she took our order, not only we told her what we wanted, we even pointed to the item on the menu to ensure she knows exactly the one we wanted.  It was incredibly offensive and embarrassing to bring our friends to this restaurant raving about the food and service when the server treated us like second class citizen all while waits hand and foot on the other party.   What really pushed the experience over the edge was even though we never got what we ordered she charged us for the item and tried to justify that it's because she wanted to give us a discount because the tiny portion of the spicy pork she ordered for us would cost $17.99! WTF?!?!? The owner was also there, he could care less if his customers were treated poorly and didn't bother to care even after the server commented on this mistake.    Dining out should be an enjoyment.  All while the food can be amazing but being treated the way we did it's unforgivable.  I rather go elsewhere in town in the future to avoid this negative experience.  As much as I would like to give them a second chance i find it hard to justify it in this case."}
{"text":"I came here many times .I always satisfied what I got in here.  specially lunch combo is the best for the price. you should try it!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious at this restaurant! I always get the tofu soup and the kalbi. I would also recommend the seafood pancake for people who haven't tried Korean food. The customer service is excellent as well. The waitresses give you a lot of side dishes and are attentive!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service! The restaurant was literally empty and I sat down and asked for a beer and a menu, minutes later a Korean lady walked in and everyone surrounded her and brought her food and tea while I sat wondering if the waitress thought I was invisible! Such piss poor service that after 15 minutes I got up and left. This place had a different name a few months ago and most likely will have a different one sooner than later. By far the worst service I have experienced lately. There were 3 employees during the time I was there, yet no one acknowledged the fact that a paying customer left and will never return. After having dined there before I know that their food quality is mediocre but ok for a late night cheap meal. There are obviously better Korean restaurants by higher service skills."}
{"text":"Miga is a new restaurant now, serving the high-end seafoods, extremely FRESH, because most of the seafoods are right from their fish tank!!  A new chef was brought in from L.A., who's trained in the fine art of making sashimi off the fish which were alive 2 seconds ago.  Yes, my wife could not look at the fish in the fish tank but I took some photos; my wife did agree, however, that the fish meat was really fresh.  We also ate oysters and shrimps which were also alive before we got there...and they were fresh!!  Yes, if you are prone to feeling guilty about all living beings, as in Buddhism, this restaurant may not be for you, but, man, the seafood is FRESH!!  Only one in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here to try this new place out. I came for lunch and they had great lunch specials from open to 3pm. I ordered the number 1 lunch special. It was kalbi and seafood tofu soup combo. My server was a sweet Korean girl. She was nice and did a good job. Their menu they hand out at the table was just on paper, but they also have a menu in the front where you can see as well. It's a clean small cute restaurant. Decorations was nice up front by the cashier. They even have soju :-) . The side dishes were perfect for me. I loved all the side dishes that I got. I love the broccoli with the red sauce because other places just give you broccoli and no sauce. My favorite side dish was their egg! The best! My seafood soup was really good and plenty of seafood in it. It was delicious. My kalbi was good but they give you little meat for the lunch combo. My kalbi only came in 3 pieces of meat, but I'm glad they did because it was just enough for me. I am glad I didn't waste food. Overall I would come back here for lunch and it's right by my apartment! Yayy"}
{"text":"Awesome authentic Korean food. Friendly environment and great service! We had spicy pork and seafood tofu soup. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery through Uber Eats (sorry Yelp 24), and by far the best and fastest delivery experience I ever had. This food is soooooooo good. I actually ordered 2 dishes... The kalbi short ribs with the 3 sides, and the bimbop. I love Korean sides. So I only wish I had more. Usually when I eat at a Korean BBQ, I usually ask for extra. Their fried rice is better than any Chinese restaurants could ever be..... suuuupppper good. I'd get a entree sized portion of that (if possible) The bimbop was good, however, the egg was a bit runnierand still clear in some areas, which is not how I would want my fried egg it to be. My food wasn't hot just warm when I got it so I did have to microwave it, and I did ask for extra chile sauce, and only got 2 containers. I absolutely love Korean chile paste (if anyone has a recipe... let me know).  I would definitely be interested in dining here and trying different things.  Oh, and the price is really good for Korean food, some places are super expensive , and  is his is great for someone on a budget"}
{"text":"This Miga  was. The best restaurant we had in long tine.. price is very good..  our three friends was very happy here.. we differently will conback ."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the BIBIMBAP this is the place. I've had my share of bibimbap around Vegas and this one is the best. Portion is HUGE and filled with fresh and tasty condiments. The kimchi is bomb, and the red hot sauce for the side has a hint of sweet to the spice. The bulgogi meat with the dish is so delicious (theres also a vegetarian version) and the sides change on occasion depending on what they have--from different kinds of mushrooms to varying radishes. Wonderful place, and the owners are super sweet people. I'm a regular now just for the bibimbap. Also, it's super clean and charming."}
{"text":"Best Soon Du Bu (Tofu Soup in stonepot) in the city.  The complimentary cold dishes are tasty.    Kim chi is a little on the sweet side but I enjoy they make everything fresh same day.  You do have to exercise some patience when dining here because the kitchen is behind on orders due to their popularity.    The Korean food here is legit with authentic flavors, as can tell by an almost all Korean clientele during lunch time.  They also have a great lunch special.  Miga is my go to for non-BBQ Korean food."}
{"text":"Im not sure how this place got high reviews. It's my first time here and found it based on the reviews on yelp.  I was greatly disappointed. I ordered meat jun and the texture of the meat was like mush. It was like someone chewed the meat and then spit it out. That's how the texture was.  I asked the waitress if that's normal, she asked the guy in the kitchen and he said that's how it's suppose to be. I wish they cared enough to ask if i wanted something else.  But sadly, they didn't. I left there still hungry. I didn't eat any of it, honestly i was worried the meat was bad. I would not recommend this place to anyone ."}
{"text":"I was lazy and decided to order food through Ubereats. I ordered the kalbi beef combo & the seafood tofu soup combo. I was really, really disappointed in the portion of the kalbi beef especially paying $13.99 for it. The flavor was good but it was so small and didn't fill up my bf and I doubt it would have filled me up either. Maybe if we dined in the portions might have been bigger, since everyone else says they've gotten pretty big portions. But then again they're probably just cheap with kalbi beef. I won't order from here again and I won't bother trying to dine in either. The seafood tofu soup was mediocre, definitely had better elsewhere. They only gave me 2 pieces of shrimp, 2 small clams, & 1 oyster. Definitely not enough meat, if I knew they'd be so cheap with the seafood I would of ordered beef or pork. I mean c'mon it was $10.99 for the soup, should have gotten more for my money. The sides we got were kimchi, jap chae, & the mac salad. The kim chi wasn't fermented long enough, it was just thrown and mixed up in the sauce, the jap-chae and mac salad was mehhhh. I'll be getting korean food somewhere else from now on."}
{"text":"After searching around for a Korean restaurant to sell me sides and plain white rice this was the only Korean restaurant that said yes to me, in English. thank you Judy."}
{"text":"Came here because I was craving Korean soup on a cold night.  The store is pretty legit authentic Korean and the menu had good options of soups.  I ordered the gamjatang (Pork Neck Soup) and thought it was just so so.  I prefer the soups at Tang better.  This soup was good but it didn't have as much veggies as I would have liked.  Also, the texture is very gritty.  My friend ordered the combination tofu soup.  She liked the flavor and thought there was a decent amount of meat."}
{"text":"Avoid this place by all means necessary.   2 stars because the waitress is really friendly. Some of the sides are good. Like the kimchi the broccoli with horseradish sauce and the bean sprouts.   I ordered the spicy garlic chicken. It was blah. The spice was nowhere to be found and the breaded chicken was soggy. I chose fried rice and that just tasted like cooking oil and rice. Not really a good plate.   My wife had Chicken Katsu Curry. It was good. Chicken was moist and the breading was good. The curry tasted really good too. No spice in the curry which we could've did with some kind of spice.   Also ordered Spicy Pork. My kid didnt like it. Most of her meat was fat. But she's picky about that..she also said it wasnt spicy enough and she's 9yrs old.   Overall, this will be our first and last visit and would not recommend this place. You're better off at Jun's.. thats just the honest truth."}
{"text":"First time here and very impressed so far.  Lunch combo:  $8.99 spicy pork and cold noodle was excellent with correct sized portions.  Bonchon was good as well.  Menu selection was good.  Kimchi  Stew $9.99 was good as well. Menu selection, food taste and quality with reasonable prices, makes this place well balanced and worth the giving it a try.  The service was excellent...  Very attentive and kind."}
{"text":"Our family wanted Korean food for Thanksgiving in Vegas, and Miga looked good on Yelp, so we tried it.  What a fantastic experience!  The food was great and the service was even better.  Judy helped us pick the menu items that matched our tastes, and also pointed out the best deals.  After we finished, her husband Nike came out of the kitchen to ask how our meal was.  Business was slow on the holiday, so we talked for almost an hour afterwards.  We felt like family!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service, delicious food! The pig feet and pork belly is to die for! Good prices and good management 100% recommend! And there's other items too like spicy chicken feet."}
{"text":"This place makes you feel very welcome because of their friendly staff. They are very attentive and the food is great! This might sound weird but it reminds me of those places you see in a k-drama where you go to hang out and drink and grub on good food. The lady working here is very very sweet and gave our designated driver a soda for free."}
{"text":"Mehh.. not my favorite.. portion is big but price isn't cheap either. The taste was okay, nothing special.  I had the topokki, it supposed to have a chewy texture but what I got is mushy. It was more like boiled potatoes Service was good tho, she was nice and checking our table for a couple times.  The restaurant was also empty n it was a dinner time."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Clean restaurant. Hot tofu soup, fried fish and bibimbab (mixed vegi+rice) was awesome. All side dish testy also. I'll try more Korean food later :) maybe Korean sausage soup...."}
{"text":"Ordered them through grub hub. Over an hour later I received a call from them directly telling me that the driver has the wrong order and they want me to refuse the delivery. He said that another family called when they opened their order that was wrong and it was my food. He blamed the driver profusely Saying he intentionally switched the orders. I called grub hub to find out how this was going to shake down, I'm almost positive I was going to end up with the \"touched\" food from the other home. Grub Hub offered me a refund. However the restaurant tried hard to blame me and say I'm the one that cancelled the delivery. I have the conversation recorded. And my chat with grub hub! No hiding! Dishonest! Horrible liars! And the delivery drivers were their own drivers!"}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!! I placed an order through grubhub and recieved it in timely fashion. When I opened my bags it was missing several items and the wrong dish was sent instead of my original order. I called the restaurant to have it fixed and the gentelment who answered was rude, claiming everything was there as he packed it himself. He even threatened me over the phone saying if I came in in person \"I wouldn't like what would happen\" even the food that was right was horrificly disgusting."}
{"text":"The food is great.  The restaurant is pretty much non-descript.  All-in-all, a very good experience that I would repeat soon!  I high;y recommend!  The prices are also very reasonable!   Even though the menu says 2 or 3 side dishes with each of their combo orders, they dd not hesitate to provide us with multiple ban-chan re-orders which were fantastic, especially the kimchee!!!"}
{"text":"Food was fast. I haven't touched it and the sides are so small. For ten bucks please don't be stingy with the sides that's the best part."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????Las vegas ???????"}
{"text":"Food was a little tasteless i'll give it 3 stars for amazing customer service. But bbq chicken was dry and meat jun wasn't too appetizing... sides are amazing though."}
