{"text":"WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY OVERLY HYPED.

why do people rave about this place???? it's not even great for etobicoke standards. the burger was dry and NOTHING special about it. i can make that at home - thank you very much - and the price doesn't even justify it."}
{"text":"I've been going to Apache burger for years but since i've moved to another part of the city I haven't been going that much lately.  The burgers are great and the toppings are always fresh.  I love the onion rings even though i hate onions.

The staff are friendly and quick.  They have to be this place is always packed."}
{"text":"A pretty delicious late night joint! Not a big fan of the onion rings, heavy on the batter. Their poutine is amazing though."}
{"text":"Great burger joint. Not the best burger in town, but close. The onion rings and milkshakes are amazing and it's not too many burger joints that are so consistent across the board. Only drawback is that it's a little on the pricey side. Fast service too."}
{"text":"Back in the day when I used to eat meat, Apache was one of my FAV burger places.  Back in grade school and highschool we used to visit Apache at least once a week.  The place is simple and old school.  Burgers, dogs, fries, rings.  I have yet to indulge in their veggie burger but I highly recommend their fries and onion rings.  Potentially the best old school, hand dipped onion rings in the city.

In need of a late night snack in the west end... give Apache a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Apache Burgers is an Etobicoke landmark, a '50s-style burger joint (even the mildly racist name is right out of the classic cowboys-'n'-indians kitsch of the era), which seems a bit out of place amid the condos and Kipling station transit hub. It has its share of celebrity fans, including former Leafs enforcer Tie Domi.

The burgers, fries, rings, etc., are pure greasy goodness--which is to say, cardiac badness, but if you're looking for healthy food, you wouldn't be near here in the first place. The prices are reasonable, and another plus about Apache is that they're open late, so that you and your crew can cruise on over during the wee hours when you get the munchies, and pretend you're in American Graffiti. Almost."}
{"text":"As a kid, I'd give this place 5 stars, now, not so much. Burgers are pre-made now, and lack something. Its ok, nothing spectacular. Theres much better burgers in Toronto like burger bar in Kensington Market. Its a good, old fashioned burger joint, plain and simple."}
{"text":"This place is an Etobicoke institution.

I've been here a ton of times over the years, and it's consistent what you get every time.  A big, yummy, greasy burger of goodness.  None of the fancy stuff you see with the trendy upscale burgers now.  Nothing special here.  Just a cute old diner that's a blast from the past.  It hits the spot.  Service is always super friendly.  Usually always busy.  

Yeah, it's not the most fabulous burger in the world, but I think everyone knows that, but we all still love it anyways!"}
{"text":"This place is an institution I remember coming here when I was a kid. I just don't think that they have a good product. Back in the day it was special but in today's foodie world where the burger reigns king I truly think the need to step up their game. #endthefrozenpatty"}
{"text":"Meh its decent but very over rated. Many people talk about it as one of the best burgers in the city, thats a major strectch. 

. not impressive. I 5 minutes away for 3 years and I think I ate there 5-6 times. I drove up to vic park and sheppard for Johnnys all the time."}
{"text":"Cash only. Open late night. Walking distance from Kipling station. 

I've been going to Apache since my childhood and can honestly the quality has deteriorated since. I don't know whether management has changed hands or whether they've opted for lower quality ingredients in order to save a little money, but it's not what it used to be. Burgers are a little boring, with all meats and veggie burgers being cooked on the same grill (if that is of concern to you, of course.) Recently decided to order the chicken burger and it was the saddest culinary experience I've ever had. The chicken was horribly under-seasoned and of the Subway variety (some kind of soy protein), and tasted like freezer. Milkshakes are also lackluster and nothing to write home about. 

All this comes with great disappointment as many people who have been here will tell you: it's not cheap! Your guaranteed options are the fries, the onion rings and possibly the gravy on a good day. I truly believe this place is still open because it holds sentimental value to many people after having been around for so long and because it stays open late, but there are seriously many better options."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars

I never thought I'd find anything at Apache Burger that was worth visiting, despite all my friends and family raving about how good the burgers are. I've lived in Etobicoke for 30 years and never thought to go in to check it out. 

Last week, a friend convinced me to give it a try - I figured, what the heck, it is about time! I was super surprised (and happy) to find a veggie burger on the menu along with typical burger joint fare. 

Great price. Atmosphere is... well... it is what it is. Service was friendly and quick. The fries and onion rings were very good. The veggie burger was good. Bonus: you can choose your toppings, and the toppings are fresh.

My only complaints are that the floors in the restaurant were pretty dirty (garbage, empty cups, ketchup...) and the bathrooms were not the cleanest either.

I would go back again if I was looking for a quick, greasy meal after a night out, or swing by for takeout."}
{"text":"Where else can you get the best greasy spoon food till 3am?? Nowhere. 

Apache is an Etobicoke icon and many a generation has enjoyed the great food. But make sure you bring your appetite. 

The regular burger or cheeseburger are fine, but I'm a fan of the banquet burger. Bacon makes everything better. If you're really adventurous - try the Apache burger!

There is no shortage of fresh toppings and everything is made to order. You won't find your burger patty stuffed in a heating drawer here. 

Fries are also made to order and are always hot and fresh. I think they have the best gravy in town - but I prefer it on the side. You won't find onion ring this good ANYWHERE else. Greasy as can be but that's the whole idea right?

Many complain about the decor, but this isn't a fine dining establishment. It's got old 50s diner allure and a pretty amazing history of visitors as can be seen in the picture collage on the wall next to the cash register. 

You'll often find a line-up but it moves fast and is worth the wait. So even if you just stumbled out of the local after having a few too many - be patient. Your taste buds and stomach will thank you."}
{"text":"I have to give this place a 3 stars because I have gone when it was really good quality burgers. But recently the times I have gone, the burgers have really changed a lot in a bad way. I remember there burgers being so juicy, fresh and being bigger. Now they taste more cheap and it seems the meats are frozen for a long time. There onion rings were rated number 1 which i agreed a couple of years ago when they were big and thick. Now they have gotten really thin that the taste completely changed. Hopefully they can get the quality back the way it use to be a couple of years ago."}
{"text":"Apache never disappoints. Best burgers in Etobicoke. Don't forget to wash it down with some rings and a milkshake."}
{"text":"Just as Tom T. mentioned, Apache was the ' go to ' spot for late night food after a night of drinking during university back in the 70's - not too far from the bars around Dundas and Islington. 

And now, some 25 years later, the place is just as great as it always was with probably the best  burger s( and especially ) fries in the GTA.

I introduced all my kids to Apache and we'd often detour up from the QEW while heading in or out of downtown T.O from the west end because we love the burgers and fires so much - and still will make a special trip from Burlington if we're craving an ' Apache fix '.

Some things never change and ........they shouldn't. 

And Apache is one of those things .......Apache was a GTA  institution back in the 70's and it still is today !."}
{"text":"Love it! And they're open late. My only request is that they start accepting debit."}
{"text":"It's a very good burger. Best in the city? No. Best in the neighborhood? No doubt.

Unlike most, I'm not a fan of the onion rings - too much batter. But the fries are good, as is the gravy and the poutine. 

If the buns are fresh, which the almost always are, this is a fantastic burger. I go once a month. Hell, even my girlfriend, who is pretty picky, loves their burgers."}
{"text":"A fast food place where I get to pick the multiple condiments on my burger?  awesome.  Watch them grill it?  awesome.  know that my fries are freshly cooked?  also awesome.

Walking through the restaurant to see food scraps on the floor and a place that could use a good clean?  perhaps not so great.  Maybe the holiday Monday was a bad idea to go there, but there wasn't much else open.  Very very decent food though!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent and greasy. If they install a defibrillator on the wall. I'm sure business will multiple very rapidly!!"}
{"text":"This place is not to bad, had the Apache burger which was huge! But pretty good. Enjoyed the onion rings as well. Decent local burger joint"}
{"text":"This place is always packed no matter what time it is.  However  I have to agree with Ana D. I to don't see what the big deal is about this place.  

The burgers are good however not nothing to be to crazy about. I am sure I'll return since it's good food and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The burger itself is very thin,  wide and cooks easily. The cook slices it up on the grill with his spatula it to make it cook even faster.. the taste of the beef well nothing unlike what you can make from a package of medium ground beef at Loblaws plus a sprinkle of salt.

You got the usual toppings,  tomatoes, pickles, onions, lettuce, mustard, mayo, bbq sauce, ketchup, pepper rings. 

The bun is fresh and the only stand out item of the burger. 

So what you're presented with is a fairly w i d e  burger \"think burger king whopper\" in a soft daily baked bun. 


Also ordered a poutine. The fries were freshly cut, cheese curds melt in your mouth good, and brown gravy was not too salty. It was actually a very good poutine. 

Surprisingly for a diner the looks inside the restaurant is fresh and clean. They maintain it well.  

Would I go back?  No, I was just curious to check it out and I don't live in the area. The burger was average. But the place makes a good meeting spot/hangout."}
{"text":"Étrange nom, mais un excellent petit restaurant de restauration rapide. Burgers et frites sont au menu bien évidemment, mais plus encore. C'est étriqué, ça sent la friture à plein nez, le service à la caisse ne se fait pas avec tendresse mais au fond, si vous êtes ici, c'est pour manger un bon burger à l'américaine."}
{"text":"Top notch burger place for after a night out. Shout out to my Croatian and Bosnian friends doing a great job!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place gets rated so high and appears on list of \"best burgers in the GTA\". I tried it once and was not very impressed. The food is extremely greasy and I was not impressed by the taste or quality. The service was not very friendly. It seemed like the staff didn't want to be there. There are definitely better burger places out there."}
{"text":"mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...that pretty much sums it up. 

I've been to Apache Burgers a few times and it always leaves me with a good impression. Most recently I enjoyed the banquet burger with an order of half n, half (half fries, half onion rings).

The burger itself was awesome. Cooked perfectly, with a nice thick slice of cheese melted on it. The dude putting on my toppings was on the ball. He waited to hear all my topping before dressing the burger because he obviously had a method to the each bite I took contained a bit of each topping. You rock Apache burger dresser guy.  

My favourite item on the menu is the home made onion rings. Not quite as crispy as they are at most places and have a distinct doughy batter taste. Oh man, I want some right now. I'm cutting this review short to go get some more!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try out Apache for the longest time, Today I finally stopped by.. Had an Apache Burger with fries and small drink.. $14
A little on the high side for what you actually get burger and fries were decent but really dont come close to Five Guys or Burger Priest.
Will I go back? Maybe if in the area.
Service was quick and efficient !"}
{"text":"Quite honestly this place has an OK burger but it is over rated and over hyped.  I've had better before for sure.  I'm also not a fan that you can not order a combo.  So your 8 dollar burger turns into a 13 dollar combo once you buy everything separately, so it is a little expensive for a burger joint.  

However they do have amazing onion rings.

As well i was a little upset with their service, kind of rude.  When I asked to change my fries to rings, and abrupt no was answered.  They said they couldn't change my order, cause everything is made to order.  That's understandable but this place is so busy that I'm sure they can sell the fries within the next 5 minutes.

Either way overrated over hyped and just OK."}
{"text":"This place must be skating by on nostalgia. I have heard so much about it, and it definitely hasn't earned its place in the collective consciousness.

The burger patty was wafer-thin. I could barely taste meat. I could catch a whiff of grilled flavour, but not even a hint of beef. This was compounded by the fact that the bun was large and bready. The bun also seemed not fresh, so it had that stale slightly crumbly texture that bready buns sometimes get. The bready bun and the toppings just overwhelmed this incredibly thin patty. If you want to give this burger a try, go for a double or even triple patty configuration.

The onion rings, as hard as it may be to believe, were even more of a letdown than the burger. I've never come across onion rings with a leathery texture until I tried the ones here. Seriously, leathery. The batter was tough and chewy. I don't even know how they accomplished that feat. Perhaps they worked the batter too much? I have no idea. Next time try barely working the batter and lighten it up by subbing some of the flour for cornstarch and using ice water. 

I would not come back here again unless I heard that the food underwent massive improvement. 

I will end on a positive note: the service was very nice."}
{"text":"I've read a lot of negative reviews about Apache recently and I'm not sure why. The place has been around for ages, my dad has even mentioned going there as a teen. I decided to give the place a try. This will be a multi-step review.

The food: I've been reading that the burgers are dry and expensive, but I didn't think so on either front. My burger was juicy, cooked just right. I had the double cheese burger and it was only a little over 7 bucks. The patties were bigger than I expected and the taste surprised me too (In a good way). I had a poutine as well, it was alright, not outstanding or anything, but the place is really about the burgers anyhow so I can understand that. All in all the burger was really quite good.

Service: I've read the staff was intimidating, and less than friendly. While I didn't find them to be overly friendly, I wouldn't say they were bad either. They dealt with me in a perfectly reasonable way. They managed to push through an impressive amount of customers in a short period of time, the wait was way less than I expected. I was impressed by the efficiency. 

Decor: It's dated, and awful, but that's kind of the point. It looks like you took a step back in time to a little hole in the wall burger joint. Not my favorite ever, but that's not really what this kind of place is about.

So yeah all in all Apache burger's is reasonable in price and quality. You won't wait forever for your food either. If you're a fan of typical fast food, but want something that's just a little bit better it'd certainly be worth taking a look."}
{"text":"If you're going to put burger in the name of your restaurant you had better have an ass kicking awesome burger. Apache isn't bad, but it's never strives above mediocre. It feels expensive for what you get. The burger across the street at the pedestrian dundas street grill is better, IMHO, despite not being flame grilled, and is under 8 bucks. 

Not bad. I like the toppings. Just not worth it. If you want a gourmet burger at that price you'll get something special."}
{"text":"A delicious burger joint right by Kipling subway station. Every time I've been the food has been great. The gravy is quite good too! Lost a star as the dining area is usually quite messy."}
{"text":"I don't know what make this burger place special I order beef burger and was less than mecdoland dry and not tasty at all  
I would never come back"}
{"text":"My parents went here in the 60's and myself for 30 years. It's time we all stop and put the old chief out of his misery.

A shell of its former self, Apache now serves of wafer thin, chewy, yes chewy beef patties and awful unsalted fries, served up by a characterless indifferent young staff.

OK back to the chewy... This is ground beef, it can't be chewy, how is that even possible? Most quality ground is Chuck which is tough as nails whole, yet like butter when properly ground. I'm am alpha carnivore and I nearly gagged. 

Let's get some pros at this locaton, Zet south location, perhaps a burgers priest? Shit let's move magoos over a few kms... Anything but this.

If you're this area late night, save yourself the bad food a vacant attitudes, just hit wendys or MacDonalds, the food is much better at either, which isn't saying a lot!"}
{"text":"Apache Burgers is a burger powerhouse, if you will. 

Gargantuan, artery-banging, gut-raping burgers that will leave you sweating and aching in an utter meat-frenzy. 

The real deal, if you will. Gotta have fries and onion rings. Maybe even a shake? You bet your ass. Good stuff, every time."}
{"text":"Great food, good service, comfortable environment. I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and terrible service. 32 bucks for a couple of frozen burgers with onion rings and drinks... come on."}
{"text":"Burgers are not huge and certainly not juicy. Over priced small burgers and over cooked and quite greasy fries. Still in the 80's with lack of debit machine, but quite willing to get service charge from ATM cuz they don't make enough money on their pre made burgers. Back about 5 years ago, was amazing and highly recommendable, now not so much at all. Disappointing to say the least, only surviving because of past reputation"}
{"text":"Was there years ago for lunch, at the suggestion of a coworker.
There were quite a few people in line & I took maybe an extra moment to tell the guy what goes on my burger (seemed to be the owner), his already snarky attitude turned visibly hostile. I ordered a burger and a drink and declined his suggestion for an order of fries. Now, believe this - he declined to give me a tray to carry my food (just a burger & a drink). When I asked for a tray, this is exactly what he said \"We believe it is easier to carry a burger and a drink in each hand\". Everyone there looked stunned. That was the first and last time I stepped into that place."}
{"text":"Amazing and fresh made burgers. Whenever I'm craving a late night snack I come here and get the Apache burger. The staff is always so nice and it's a very friendly family atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this burger! If you like a juicy flavourful burger then I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"It'd certainly a better burger than your typical fast food. I wouldn't say it's amazing by any stretch. Toppings were fine. The fries were good and fresh. Unsalted but that's fine in my book personally. I'll come back if I'm craving a burger. The only real issue is that they're cash only. I dislike holding money so that's a minor annoyance for me."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is great. The portions are big, the vibe is laid back, and it's easily accessible. Highly recommend visiting for anyone looking for a really good burger. The best I've found so far!"}
{"text":"As I am half Native American I was really excited about trying this place out hence the name.. Upon entering and ordering from the menu it became quite clear to me this isn't a Native run business and there isn't any Native food on the menu anywhere. I was really let down . Just another store exploiting the indigenous culture because it sounds or looks cool.. lame .."}
{"text":"Good burger. I got the double cheese burger. Was really satisfied with the size of the patty itself, very filling and good value for the price.

Taste wise, nice char on the burger, great flavour. The cheddar is thick, hand cut from a block and is very prominent. 

Was not overly happy with how the burger tasted as a whole, was very, meh. No bold flavours or anything to stand out, bbq was way too light,'didn't get any of it. 

Overall was happy to try it and nothing wrong with it but don't think I'll be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Great find in Etobicoke but get the Apache burger rather than their regular burgers (which are subpar). The only thing I'm not a fan of is the buns are placed directly on the counter without any paper underneath -- I mean, how do I know if the counter is clean?! 

The burgers are good and juicy but I wouldn't say the were the best burgers I've ever had. They are incredibly messy to eat and the place doesn't look the cleanest. I had to admit that the fries are pretty tasty though! :)"}
{"text":"This is the best \"original\" burger in the city.  By that I mean they aren't doing anything fancy and there isn't some secret menu you have to be up on.  I love the burgers at Priest but it's the option patty there, not the straight beef, that makes their giant concoctions sing.

Two things to note, for those of you either a) trying apache for the first time, or b) who didn't love it when they've been. 1) You need to order the Apache Burger.  Not the hamburger or the cheeseburger. 2) You need the barbecue sauce.  Lots of it.  It's homemade and amazing and even if you don't think you like 'cue sauce you need to try it.

My standard order is an apache burger with double 'cue sauce, lettuce, and pickles, an order of the amazing onion rings (with extra 'cue sauce for dipping), and a drink.  I always leave full (and I'm a big dude) and happy.  I still drive out from downtown to get it."}
{"text":"A burger for the ages. No French fry unturned. Makes king Lear look like king koopa. Big burgs, little hassle"}
{"text":"I want so bad to love this place just because of it's reputation in Etobicoke.

Sadly, I'm not crazy about it. Their burgers are average and fries are soggy. I like their poutine and onion rings but would probably have a heart attack if I ate them more than once a month.

They don't take debit and, for some odd reason, their ATM is out of service almost every time I've gone. So either come with cash or get ready to do a bit of a walk to the nearest bank.

It's usually pretty busy especially around rush hour and they do an okay job keeping up with the line. 

Will definitely return because it's decent, local and convenient...But I really don't see why people rave about this place."}
{"text":"well, it's a lean beef pate, it grills quite nicely too, made by schniders for apaches apparently, so it's not a hand made burger that day.  tastes good, not dry, not soggy, just right.  get the toppings on it and it makes a great hungry man meal.  maybe just me, but i prefer this to some of the gourmet burgers since those tend to be too soggy for my taste, too oily.  if you like a simple well put together burger that tastes nice, you won't go wrong here."}
{"text":"OK, I've now officially come full circle! Used to drive to Apache in the wee hours of the morning during my University years after a night at the clubs.  Went back recently with my kids and found nothings changed! Delicious burgers, gigantic onion rings and the best french fries in the city! My kids also agreed and cant wait to go back!

Only negative for me are their prices! They don't offer combo deals and ordering a la cart it can get expensive, especially if you're going with kids who can't finish the gigantic portions! In this case, I would recommend you split fries or onion ring orders."}
{"text":"This place is awesome... when you go inside, is like you have traveled back in time to the 50s or 60s.... and the burgers are really tasty. The staff is not overly friendly, but they do the best to help you.
If you want to try a good burger, from an independent place, you must come here."}
{"text":"There's a reason why this place has survived so many years.  The burgers are deliciously juicy, the onion rings are legit old-school home battered, and the fries are the kind of golden brown deliciousness that you can tell are from fresh potatoes sliced on site.  The guys at the counter, who I assume must also be the owners, were extremely friendly and seemed to genuinely appreciate my patronage.  I must warn you though, I had extreme heartburn for an hour after eating a cheeseburger there.  It was totally worth it though!"}
{"text":"Below average burgers.  Cannot compare to Johnny's in Scarborough.  Homemade onion rings below average as well. Under done, doughy and bland taste.  Boy do I miss Butger Hut Homemade beer battered onion rings."}
{"text":"Its been at least 20 years since the last time i was here.  Its been far too long.  II ordered the steak sandwich and onion rings with a bottle of water.  $14, so about average on the price.  Those were some excellent onion rings, nice and chunky and crisp.  I miss those old fashioned type. Way better than the skimpy chain store type.  The steak was also very tasty, and the kaiser was fresh, so this was a great little trip down memory lane.  I must admit the place is way cleaner than i remember it, so thats a huge plus."}
{"text":"This is possibly the quintessential late night burger place in Etobicoke. It's been here forever, the burgers are decent and the prices aren't going to break the bank. 

You get what it is you pay for. It's a classic burger on a soft bun with all the toppings you want. I normally don't get fries but when I get them here they're good. They also have onion rings if you prefer. 

No debit though so I think it's cash only. In any case it's exactly what you're looking for after a night of partying or when you've been out late and need something before going to bed. 

It's not a great burger, but it's what you want."}
{"text":"This place has been around forever and is a part of my youth because it's the kind of place that was basically open really late.  In fact when do they close???

Anyway the food is probably really good because when you go here you're really hungry that or you need to put food into yourself at that point.  

The burgers are honestly nothing special.  They are Cardinal (frozen???) I think.  They are just burgers but they are broiled on a grill indoors and you don't get everywhere so that's good.

I think their best food items are their fries and gravy as well as the onion rings.  The food here is kind of expensive.  The Apache burger is the most expensive burger but if you're going to pay that much you would probably be better going to burger king or wendy's.

One thing you will notice waiting in line is there are a bunch of photos on the wall with many Toronto Maple Leafs players in there circa 1990ish (Tom Fitzgerald, Mats Sundin, Tomas Kaberle, Bryan McCabe, Wade Belake, Clarke Wilm etc.

This place for me is nostalgic but honestly it's not a great bang for the buck."}
{"text":"Apache is a little overrated and overpriced. But with that said, if I crave it, it's the only thing that can satisfy me. Not even C&Dubbs. Does that make me weird?  I don't know. With their vintage style diner theme, they make a good burger and Im pretty sure it's illegal in Etobicoke to not like their onion rings. And if you don't finish your meal, ty domi will show up at your door and jersey you."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! We came here twice on our vacation to the Toronto area. They're very accommodating with your orders and also take American currency. The onion rings are a must try!"}
{"text":"Slightly better than Harvey's for double the price. They only take cash.  Apache burger was good. Onion rings are chewy."}
{"text":"Had to adjust my review.  Went yesterday and found the burger to be good, fries ok, gravy no good.  Cold and lumpy.  The onion rings were awful, almost like they were cooked earlier then tossed back in the fryer to try to heat them up.   Was disappointed."}
{"text":"Apache burger is a long time local spot.  Similar to Johnnys in the east end which I grew up with.
Burgers are flame grilled , fries and rings good. Can't decide order frings.
Standard toppings.
Open late. Lots of parking right beside plaza.
Cash only."}
{"text":"It's all about the banquet burger the BBQ sauce and onion rings.

Always busy on weekends or late night's, but always a good burger."}
{"text":"Muy buenas burger 
Y los aros de cebolla en su pinto.
Difinitivamente regresare  
Unas de las mejores de Etobicoke"}
{"text":"Back in the day, I classified this place as one of the more expensive burger joints.  Now that we have a lot more specialty burger joints, this place actually has become quite affordable in comparison.

Note that they only take cash here.  The burger patty is large in diameter, but thin.  There is a nice charred taste to the patty.  The burger bread is pretty large as well.  There are the usual condiments, and if you don't tell them to add ketchup and mayo, they slather on bbq sauce instead.  Their specialty is the Apache Burger.

I would not recommend their poutine.  It wasn't worth it at all.  The gravy was watery, it had no taste.  The fries was super soggy.  Really need to add salt.  It was disappointing.

Overall, this burger spot is a legend for people in Etobicoke.  Before all the specialty joints popped up, I would have rated this place 5* stars, now, it is just ok.  The real kicker for the lower score are the lackluster sides.  The burger is above average due to the charred taste."}
{"text":"This place is like angels came down from heaven and landed in your mouth. And the onion rings? Dude, that is as good as life gets. Go to this place now. Hurry. Stop reading this review and go. Seriously, why are you still reading this? I said stop! Go to Apache and eat the rings!"}
{"text":"Great for a good greasy burger.  Definitely hit the spot.  Would go again,"}
{"text":"To be honest, this is the only time I would actually eat a hamburger because:

Burger + Onion Rings = Life completed. (at Apache Burgers that is.)

This place has been around for ages and is open really really late for all those looking for late night food after the bars.  It's busy all the time and I'm not surprised..."}
{"text":"Good old fashioned down to earth burgers, fries and onion rings. Good meat and cooked just right. Simple but delicious!"}
{"text":"Apache is good if you're craving a real burger at 2am (not BK or McDonald's). The burgers are big, juicy, and topped with fresh toppings like onions, tomatoes, iceberg lettuce, and even hot bell peppers if you're craving that extra kick. I got the Banquet burger the last time I went and was unimpressed by the bacon that was included as I couldn't even tell it was there, although to be fair I like to pile my toppings very high and get extra hot peppers as well! Next time I will stick to the cheeseburger. 

We always get the fries to share with our burgers as the burgers themselves are so big they fill us up quite well. The onion rings on the other hand were way too greasy and had too much batter. 

Service is always friendly and there's ample parking at the lot right outside. Expect this place to always be busy as well--even at 1am! The line moves quickly though so it's not too bad."}
{"text":"Solid greasy spoon. The onion rings were SPECTACULAR!! seriously would have given this place a 5 star rating based on the onion rings alone, but the other stuff was just alright. Veggie burger was pretty ok, and the chocolate milk shake was ok too, not the best I have had. Those onion rings though... mmmmmmm. Also would be good if they had peach juice, it looked like they maybe would have sometimes but at the mo ment they did not."}
{"text":"Open til late nights. Can't complain. Patties are massive and burgers taste great. A bit pricey. 

Parking is difficult during the day but isn't an issue at 3:00a.m in the morning."}
{"text":"My wife and I go here anytime we want a really juicy burger.  Greasy place but well worth it if your having a guilt-free night.

One of the best onion ring batters i've had"}
{"text":"If the quality has supposedly slipped over the past few years, I haven't noticed. For me it's still the go-to place for (veggie) burgers in Etobicoke at 2:00 in the morning or anytime really...but especially at 2:00 in the morning! Whether it was on the way home from some mostly wholesome fun downtown or an evening university class, Apache Burgers' super convenient location (on my way home from the subway station) made it my savior for many years and even if I don't head out that way nearly as much as I used to, I still relish* the chance to grab a veggie burger any chance I get. 

Yes, it is a cash only proposition. You should know that by now and if you don't, there's a generic ATM that will rob you blind if you're desperate. Deal with it.

No, they do not have fancy toppings like sautéed onions or chutney or guacamole. It's not that kind of burger place. But the toppings they do have are always fresh and tasty. Plus I never once have had to ask for them to replace the under ripe tomato on my burger with a nice red one...I can see them picking through the pile, making sure that only the best fixins find their way to my burger. Love that attention to detail. 

Perhaps the service isn't the cheeriest in the world but truth be told, I've never had a bad experience. I'll take fast, professional and quietly efficient over fake friendly any day. 

So as far as I'm concerned, Apache Burgers is nothing if not a quality burger joint. Yes, I do only get the veggie burger (plus their very tasty fries and onion rings) but as far as I'm concerned, it's one of the best around and even if it wasn't, you could do a LOT worse at 2:00 in the morning. Trust me.

*P.S. Ironically enough despite my awful pun, relish is the only topping I do NOT get on my burger."}
{"text":"Have to say, not great. I have been by here many times and wanted to try it. Finally did. First thing I noticed was the staff. Them were gossiping behind the counter and service took forever. The were friendly but the gossip went on and on and on. And loud with out any concern what was said in front of customers. Bad optics
Now for the food, the burger simply was not great, meat was not juicy and was tough. The toppings were very fresh but the bun fell apart.Very little taste. The fries were hand cut but didn't taste great, I would have to say with all the choices these days for burgers, like Burger Priest, 5 Guys etc... they could do a little better, seems to be coasting on locals nostalgia . I would give it a pass, I saw I came I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place should be named \"How much abuse can you take\".  Talk about unwanted business.  This place don't want your business.  Over rated food and over priced.  Nickel & diming every thing including an extra napkine & bag for your food.  Do yourselves a favor don't go there. This place don't deserve a star, but have to give in order to post this"}
{"text":"I'm trying to remember why Apache Burger is legendary but it fails me. It just kinda is! Burgers are very good but it's 2016 and exceptional burgers are easy to find. The onion rings are particularly good. Definitely worth a try though."}
{"text":"How many of you heard about Apache from one of those \"classic burger places\" type of articles on one of those BlogTO type of thing, or caught a glimmer of it in the movie Room?

It opens late night for a diner far out there in the city. Its neon signs commands attention in the area. A pair of men eating beside me were commenting on the sterile decor, \"Feels like the 70s.\" If you ask me, feels more like  Los Pollos Hermanos (Breaking Bad) with reproduction retro diner fixed furniture, along with some Indian motifs and creepy Marilyn Monroe mosaics on one wall thrown in. Maybe they're still expecting someone to pull in the lot in a '59 Cadillac.

The burgers themselves aren't that creepy, but they are not foodie gourmet material either. But considering how cheap? it is by current hyperinflated Toronto standards, it's alright. Harvey's? style fast food service with your builders basic selection of toppings, along with a choice of burgers, including the 'Banquet' (which I tried--basically comes with bacon, $6.24) and the 'Apache' (double patty cheeseburger with bacon). Need something warm and greasy and cheap in the area? Apache will do just fine.

There's an ATM inside. And it is a short walk from Kipling subway station."}
{"text":"They call it Apache Burger but I call it the \"Last Chance For Romance\". Apache Burger has been a mainstay on Dundas St. W for as long as I can remember. It was the place to go after the bars closed up and hence my nickname for this Etobicoke landmark. During the tail end of the disco era, when bars had their last call at 1:00 a.m. and you still didn't have anyone for the rhetorical last dance there was always a chance you'd get lucky at Apache. It was that kinda joint. 

I cannot ever remember being in Apache Burgers when there wasn't a line up. No matter what time of the day or night, there always seems to be a line up. Standing there waiting to get your turn to place your order you can't help but to notice that the owners are major Maple Leaf fans with the walls adorned with pics of hockey players who have come and gone from the beloved Apache Burgers. 

I'm not really sure why AB is so darned popular. Ok, so the rings are among the best I've ever chowed down on but the burgers are very much similar to what I spoke about in places like Magic Spot Grill or for that matter the upgraded burgers in Harvey's. Unlike the horrid Hero burgers these patties at least have some decent flavour. I always get the Banquet Burger at Apache. Bring me the bacon baby!

Bubba, who is a ringer for a shorter version of the actor Michael Clarke Duncan, (I don't actually know if his name is Bubba but it's what I've called him for years) is a permanent fixture at the prep table. Everytime I see him and he asks me what I want on my burger I look at him and say \"Bubba how many times have I been here before? You know damn well what I want on my burger..\" He grins his gold tooth grin and fixes my burger. Don't expect to find any caramelized onions or goat's cheese here. This is Apache Burger, it's all old school. 

Everything is plentiful at Apache. Fries come stuffed, piled mighty high into their boxes, as do the rings. My Banquet burger combo set me back $11 which is on par with places like Craft. Coming in to Apache Burger is like visiting an old friend who you know will always be home and welcoming you with open arms. It's not my most favorite burger spot but its the spot I'm most sentimental for."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I don't think the burger is that great (mediocre).
I'd suggest a steak sandwich over the burger.
Onion rings are ridiculously awful.
Magoo's and Burger Priest are BETTER.
Apache has a nice vintage feel, plus it was in the movie THE ROOM...
unfortunately food has dropped off (quality) over the past decade."}
{"text":"Apache Burger is difficult to review. If it's the middle of the night and you've been out drinking, it's a pretty solid destination. If you are sober and looking for a nice burger, Apache Burger probably isn't your best bet. They only take cash, but have an ATM on location (there is also a BMO around the corner). The last time I went to AB, one of my friends had food poisoning the next morning. I've never had a burger that made me sick, but it's generally not my kind of joint."}
{"text":"Customer service was lacking and there was almost no onion in the onion rings we received,plus the server was a bit snarky when asking what I wanted on my burger"}
{"text":"The best burgers ever!!!!! My boyfriend loves the grape juice lol 

The customer service is good. The food is amazing. 

I recommend this place to everyone I know."}
{"text":"My first visit so I ordered the Apache burger with a poutine and small Dr.Pepper. Food quality was great and the service pretty awesome. I really enjoyed my burger as it was made fresh on the fire grill, the poutine was super one of the best I've ever had. The price point is on the high side however the overall quality and good atmosphere make up for the price. $17 for a burger poutine and a small soft drink. Bring cash as they do not accept debit. There is an ATM inside if you really need a burger. Great place to grab a snack while on the go. Cheers."}
{"text":"Went to Apache as sort of an unplanned cheat meal...D; 
I had the banquet burger and shared a side of fries. I enjoyed the burger but I wouldn't say it was the best burger I've ever had... 5 guys was a little more tasty to me. The fries were your standard fries... Deep fried 

I would go back but I would probably get the BBQ sauce and try something different"}
{"text":"I wanted to like Apache Burger. Not just because I'm a Linux fan. I really did. I heard many good things. But maybe built up expectations exceeded reality. Apache is a kind of low rent Harvey's although I think a burger, fries, and cola will run you more than a similar combo at Harvey's. If you're not getting enough grease in your diet, Apache Burger will max out your RDA. That's not a bad thing. At least in my book. I'm all about the grease. All 'n' all, I'm sure long time locals have a lot of fond memories of Apache Burger but nothing matched the hype. Bottom line: a great cheap quick burger alternative to the chains, probably a blessing if it's in your backyard, but don't travel in from Milton to partake of the magic of Apache Burger."}
{"text":"My boyfriend introduced me to this place, as it's one of those local places, everyone in the area, knows about.  

This place serves every phase of your life: the hang out during high school lunch time, the place you go for a bite to eat, after a huge meeting at work ... and then you end up taking your own kids here as a treat on a Friday night. 

It was a Friday night around 8pm, and the line was fearfully long. If I wasn't suffering from a serious Apache Burger craving, I probably would have walked away. I sent my boyfriend up to order, and sat down to a save us a seat. They have a small seating area at the front, but everyone seems to leave right after they eat, so there's always somewhere you can grab a seat.

The line up ended up moving surpringly quickly ... gotta love how efficient the staff is. They're super fast & accurate, and even with the chaos of a million orders coming in, I can't complain about the service. 

The menu is simple: hamburger ($4.95), cheese burger ($5.95) ... and a few other burgers that involve extra beef & bacon. I over heard a lot of people ordering the veggie burger, so I'm sure they're popular.  When ordering, fries/sides are a separate item. They don't do 'meal deals' here, which isn't a deal breaker. 

They have lots of bottled drinks to pick from & have fountain pop avail. 
I ordered a $4.95 medium chocolate milk shake, was was disgusting. My boyfriend handed it to me, and told me *after* I did a 'yuck' face, that it was just (grainy) soft serve ice cream in a cup. 

The burgers are nice and greasy, and come on a flatter than usual fresh & flaky toasted kaiser bun.  Fries are beautifully fried, and there isn't a soggy one in the bunch. I found the onion rings a bit thick of batter, but my boyfriend ate them up with no issues! 

All in all, this place is waaay better than McDonald's, and really, not much more money. 
One of those greasy spoons that always hit the spot, and with the hours they're open, you can go back any time!"}
{"text":"The fries are good. I don't care too much for the burgers. The cooks slap the burger patties too much. They should leave it on the grill and just flip once or twice."}
{"text":"Live it. Reasonable price. Great atmosphere. Googled it after seeing the movie \"Room,\" lol"}
{"text":"Tried this place after reading the reviews.  What a drive if you're not in the area! Service was quite abrasive, especially being our first time.  What I didn't like at all was the person who handled the raw burgers also handled the buns!!!  I don't need to tell you how I felt later on.  Cross contamination is an absolute NO NO.  My friend enjoyed her burger and thankfully she has a stomach of steel.  Fries were good."}
{"text":"It's surprising that Apache Burgers remains a success in this post-burger boom landscape, as the joint, which looks like it's been around for decades, can't hold a candle to up-and-comers like The Burger's Priest, Holy Chuck, and all the rest of 'em.

It's most likely the nostalgia factor that keeps Apache in business, since their burger is passable but far from memorable. I showed up just after 11:00 on a weekday and the place was empty. I ordered the regular hamburger and a surly employee asked what I wanted on it.

It's a decent burger; the toppings are all fine and the patty itself boasts a nice charbroiled flavor. But that's where the compliments end. This tastes like exactly the sort of uninspired hamburger you could get at your local Harvey's, which is fine, if you're in the mood for it."}
{"text":"Really good \"old school\" burger place.
Friendly staff and decent seating.
Best fires and gravy I've had in a while and the burger really hit the spot.
I apparently got there at a good time because by the time I finished eating there was a line up out the door.  Seriously, out the door.
On a previous visit I tried the onion rings and they were also fantastic.
Stop by if in the area."}
{"text":"If you live in the area the food is OK. Nothing fresh or special, it's part of the late night limited options category. 

The only people who seem to love this place are people raised in etobicoke, I moved here a couple years ago, and everyone I know admits it's an nostalgia thing if they like it. As a girl who has lived and traveled all over Toronto and always had family all over Toronto and the GTA, I consider myself unbiased lol. This is one of the worser of the burger nostalgia places, of the various borough burger places that people hold dear."}
{"text":"This place has really good juicy burgers, made fresh for every burger! 

Apache is good to come on a late night when your wondering about on the streets of etobicoke, thinking to yourself \"hmm, what's open late and has good food?\"

I'm no saying these burgers are the best BUT they're fresh and  good size for the price your paying for them ($4-7). You don't have to worry about getting a puny burger here. The toppings are fresh, the staff is pretty funny and are usually In a good mood. The fries are pretty awesome too, the only thing is that theres no refills on drinks. So by the pay time you've gotten your burger, fries, and drink you'll be paying about $12.  But I mean Overall, it's a pretty good burger joint. Try it!"}
{"text":"It's a good burger, wedged right between mediocre and excellent. Got a Apache burger (they're signature) and a poutine. The burger was very tasty, but from what I can tell the only difference between the apache burger and a regular hamburger is that the apache one has double patties for double the price. 
- The patty was big and juicy, but I did feel that it lacked the flavor and omf for their so-called signature burger. 
- Was not a fan of their bread, it was pretty dry and the top layer pretty much completed flaked off.
- poutine was fantastic. I'm the kind of person that loves my poutines to be drenched in gravy, and this one just hits the spot!
My big take for coming next time is to just order the poutine, and maybe a regular hamburger (since its the same as the apache, but without double patties). Overall great place, great prices, and fast service!"}
{"text":"Deeeeelicious! Good deals very tasty! Do it! Poutine is great and the basic cheese burger or banquet burger are the go to faves"}
{"text":"This place is an Etobicoke stronghold. Beware of loser youth blasting music and getting blazed in the parking lot (reminiscent of any Timmy's lot).

My friend ordered the Chicken Breast Burger, and I ordered the Poutine. The bar was kind of set high since one of our old high school teachers used to rave about this place, but the food just wasn't anything special. I did appreciate that they put a dinkload of gravy on the poutine, so that there would be enough once I got to the bottom, but the taste was just not exciting.

It's only now, after reading some reviews, that my experience makes sense. Seems like the quality of the food has gone downhill in the last few years. C'mon, Apache!"}
{"text":"Okay so for the first time I finally went to this place and you know what? I'm not going back. Basically Apache burger is:

Expensive, dry, and flavourless with very average (or below) tasting fries and onion rings.

I ordered the basic hamburger (I find this is a good measure of whether or not a restaurant's burgers are up to scratch or not) and the fry+ring option (fries and onion rings together in the same box). 

The hamburger bun was huge and pretty decent, but the burgers were extremely thin and only had finely diced onions in them with no seasoning whatsoever. The bun was too big and the patty was too thin.It made the hamburger way too dry and tasteless. And keep in mind I put almost EVERYTHING on my burger: Ketchup, mustard, relish and all the veggies. Definitely one of the worst tasting burgers I have ever had. I mean it seems like they acutually make their own patties but could they not add some seasoning and make them slightly thicker so they at least taste like SOMETHING in that mountain of a bun? 

Since they seem to make their own patties, what is the point if they taste the same (actually they were more flavourless) than the frozen ones?

In addition, the rings and fry box was very expensive at over $4 and was the size of one of the smaller boxes at McDonalds. Neither the fries nor rings were salted (I guess this is good for some but if the salt isn't put on when they are freshly deep fried it doesn't stick to them and they taste bland). Any bar/Hero Burger/McDonalds/almost anywhere else has better fries. I don't know why people rave about these ones so much.

The place has NO combos and as a result a BASIC hamburger with the fries and ring box mix option (which was so small) was around $9.90 with NO drink. Such a ripoff.

Unlike other comments I have seen, the service we had was pretty good, but sadly the food was not.

If you do decide to go to Apache and try them out, keep in mind they only accept cash. Thank you so much Apache burger for thinking this is still 1982. 

Seriously, Licks, South St., Golden Star, Hero, Burger's Priest, Johnny's (in Scarborough) have better fries, are cheaper, and have MUCH better hamburgers (except for Johnny's, theirs are flavourless too but at least aren't as dry as their buns are slightly smaller with larger patties).

Bye bye Apache. I wanted to love you as you seem like a traditional burger joint. Sadly, you just don't cut it. And I LOVE burger joints. And you know what, when it comes down to it, how hard is it to screw up a burger?"}
{"text":"Take your money and go east to Magoo's where the price is about the same, but the burger is far superior."}
{"text":"It's not bad but it's not great. For a burger place it's below average. Its an old slow place that got famous for who goes there and not for the food."}
{"text":"My hubby had a burger while I had a poutine and they were juicy and delicious! Soo good."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place gets such great reviews?! I have tried it several times and all I can conclude is that I am paying about 80% more money to get food poisoning!!
This place has been around forever and although the owner likes to park his shiny mercedes out front that seems to be the only decoration this place has got. With all  the super pricey, road side slop they serve I'm sure they can afford to invest a little something back into the business.
The service is as bad as the food and the cleanliness.... DO NOT ASK!!

The only good thing about this place is the fact that it is open late and right next to a 24 hr shoppers drugmart so you can promptly purchase the required accessories to digest the atrocity you paid an arm and a leg for!!

Do yourself a favor and skip the meal if this is your only option!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to try this place and I've heard a lot of great things and how long the place has been running and honestly was expecting a Canadian version of in and out burger :)

After been there it's nothing special in fact a very very average place.. I'd rather pay a bit more and go to burger priest :)"}
{"text":"This was my go to place for many years.  The food has slipped to an all new low.  Burnt burgers, stale buns, greasy fries.  It is sad because I loved this place.  I now will got to Burger Priest on the Queensway.   Much better quality.  I hope they can improve their quality and return the the burger bar they used to be.  If they do they have my loyalty.  Many of my friends feel the same."}
{"text":"Went here late night with a group of friends.. Great place for a get-together like that. Burgers were good enough and filled the requirements of a late night meal with friends but not the best I've had."}
{"text":"One day, in the summer of 2002 or 2003, a friend and I were on the search for something to eat while we killed time waiting for his friend to get home. We were in Mississauga/Etobicoke and were not very familiar with the area. As he was indecisive I suggested a burger and a direction.

So we drove the way I chose and eventually we came to corner known as Kipling and Dundas and we saw three places to eat. McDonald's which was an automatic no, Red Cabin Burgers and a place called Apache Burgers. Apache was on the same side of the street as us so that is where we went.

The place was busy, there was a line up; on the wall there were pictures of celebrities who had eaten there. It was first opened up, according to the signage, in 1969 and by the looks of things it had not changed much. It is a typical late 60's diner/truck-stop/burger pit; neon colours, a few tables, a walk up counter window to pick your toppings.

We ordered, we ate, and the rest is history as they say. I loved it and have been back many times since. I have introduced many a person to the establishment and almost everyone agrees that it is dee-lish-ous. Today though was the first time i had been in a long time and the first time since the so called 'burger revolution of Toronto' had occurred. I was now used to gourmet, griddled, smashed burgers. How would Apache hold up?

So I arrived, and as usual it was packed with nary a table in sight and a long line that stayed the whole time I was there. I ordered the twin, fries and since it was a Pepsi establishment a Dr. Pepper. I had the usual toppings (pickles, onions,  tomatoes, lettuce, ketchup, mustard) and a side of BBQ sauce to dip the fries in.

The first thing I did when I got my food was delve into the fries. Now Apache always had good fries but they must be doing something different as these fries were not just good but amazing. They were off the hook! They were robust in flavour, crispy on the outside and soft and tender in the middle, thick cut, orgasmic. Paired with the BBQ sauce (homemade and fabulous and even goes good on the burger) I was in fried food heaven.

After pulling myself away from the fries it had become time to delve into the burger itself. I hoped it would live up to expectations and memories. After all, this was a frozen burger patty that is grilled on a BBQ style grill. I unwrapped the burger, looked it over, took a sip of the Dr. and took a bite.

Right away I was in burger heaven. For a frozen, preformed, grilled, well done patty (actually two of them) it was juicy, moist, tender and oh so yummy. I don't know where they get there patties from, or if they have them made especially for them, but they sure as hell are damn tasty. And maybe it's just me but every bite tastes better than the last.

The toppings too were fresh and the pickles were what I can only describe as the perfect burger pickle. The bun is a traditional and sturdy white bread bun that holds the just the right size patties in place. I've been to many a place like Apache Burger but they have never been as good. There is a reason why, out of the three places I mentioned earlier, Apache is the only one still standing.

This is a place that is quite a drive from my place but it is a drive i will gladly make any day or night of the week, all you have to do is ask. As an added bonus on Thursday's, Friday's and Saturday's it's open till 3:00 or so in the morning. I love this burger and even though it's not 'gourmet' it still tickles the palette the same way a fine wine would.

I'm going to drop it a point because it is a frozen patty but otherwise I highly recommend you try this place. It puts every other 'frozen' burger to shame. Yes... Every! Single! One!

{"text":"Movie Room used it for some scenes, and now a TV series called Conviction, starring a Canadian actor, Shawn Ashmore.Where Conviction shot exteriors,and interiors at Apache.Given the long history of being a solid diner.Has the food become inconsistent because they don't care as much due to:  some celeb.clients, cash business benefits,and being used as a film,or tv location? I've had a burger from this place a few years ago during a fairly busy service,bad when I wished I had a Big Mac instead.Then some time later, late one night while the place was dead. I did pickup some onion rings, they were GROSS.My university greasy spoons had better onion rings which I've consumed sober. The Apache rings seemed like they reheated them in the fryer.I have cut back on red meat,but when I do want a burger,it's not an Apache burger after that onion ring debacle. Someone introduced me to Woody's burgers,and they were great,along with the accepting plastic."}

{"text":"I love burgers. They don't have to be fancy-pants, they just have to be flavourful and juicy...and my burger was neither. 
I've heard about this place forever, and I have wanted to try it for a really long time, and I was just disappointed.
-The beef was bland and the bun was much too big for a patty of that size.
-The fries were great - but as soon as they cooled even a bit they were garbage. I know fries are best hot, but after about 10 mins they were disgusting. 
-The onion rings were AMAZING. Best thing about this place
-Prices were a bit too high, and no combo option
-Service was awful. Stood at the cash to place my order for about 5 mins before the guy even made EYE CONTACT with me, even though he was standing in front of me the whole time. It was like he thought that if he didn't make eye contact, maybe I wouldn't realize that he saw me there waiting? Then after taking my order he walked away while my friend waited another few mins. When he comes back he asked her \"if she wanted something\". Come on!!! 

I probably will never go back. My meal was fine, but I could go 5 mins down the street to C & Dubbs and get an AMAZING meal for less $$. I suggest you do too."}
{"text":"The burger was great ..cooked well adequete toppings and a nice soft bun.
Poutine on the other hand was soggy and the fries were undercookes. Not to mention i had no idea what kind of cheap flavorless mozerella cheese was used.
It was 1am had few options

I should mention cusyomer service is great. The dude at the cash was cute funny and very helpful"}
{"text":"Passed by here a lot of times but this was the 1st I ordered from Apache Burger. A darned good burger perfectly charbroiled with toasted bun. Got peameal bacon on my cheeseburger, just great & they have a good topping selection.Wish I had ordered onion rings as my daughter did instead of poutine since they're old fashioned hand battered rings. They have chocolate malted shakes! Wish I'd noticed that sign but our regular chocolate shakes were fine. Traditional diner decor with red sparkly vinyl & chrome stools and granite tables. Good prices, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Burgers cooked with care and with efficiency. Open until 3am. Can't ask for anything more than that.
NOTE: CASH ONLY!

With little options on a late Sunday evening, this hit the spot. Can't help but give 5 stars.

Great atmosphere.
Quick service.
Got a banquet burger (one patty, cheese, bacon), poutine and a chocolate milkshake.

Banquet Burger: patty was fresh off the grill, with cheese melted perfectly on top and the bacon was still sizzling as they lay it on your bun in front of you. You choose from an array of simple yet fresh veggies and your typical condiments.

Poutine: generous amount and constructed with care. Gravy and cheese oozing to the last bite. Sitting at the diner with a cold draft coming in, and the poutine was still steaming hot. I still got a crispy bite of fry at the very bottom. Thank you styrofoam!

Milkshake: I don't know what the difference is with the melted milkshake and the one I ordered, but mine was pretty thick. Three options for flavours: chocolate, strawberry and vanilla. Very thick indeed. Not hand spun or anything fancy, just straight out of a machine but still awesomeness and can't complain. Shared the milkshake and still couldn't finish a medium for two people.

5 stars would come back multiple times and would recommend."}
{"text":"I had heard/read some good things about this place, and it seems fairly busy when I've passed by, so I was a bit disappointed with the food and experience. 

The first thing that jumped out, even before tasting the food, was how expensive it was given the quality. Sure, I ordered the most expensive item on the menu, the \"Apache Burger,\" but it was essentially just a glorified double cheese burger. The patty did appear to be ground beef, but was quite dry and tough. The toppings  did not do much to distract from the dry crumbly buns either. I had very high hopes for the onion rings, but they were equally tough and surprisingly tasteless - not at all crispy as they appeared.

I'm not sure I will give this place another shot - the quality of burger is not much better than any fast food joint, at a much higher cost. I was also not too thrilled with all of the flies hovering around the food inside."}
{"text":"The burgers were just average, they weren't exceptionally delectable. 
But one plus was they were open very late which was easier for me to order a dinner late night ."}
{"text":"One star for not being open when they should. They say they are open till 3 AM and today when I was there by around 2 AM, they were closed and they cook gestured me that they are closed."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a long time.  I visited this place twice and I must say that after trying Hero burger and Five guys burger, I would still go to Apache burger for good burgers and onion rings with gravy on the side.

Thanks Apache."}
{"text":"Apache's has been an institution in my life for many years. My uncle and aunt and I think even my dad (if you knew my dad, you would get the \"even\"-- he doesn't do burger joints) have all sang its praises since I can remember.

Being located near the West-most point on the subway line, and me being located much farther from the subway line, it was always a symbolic landmark, a midway point between city and suburb. And since it was open until just after the subway closed, an exciting late night trip back from \"downtown!!\" for a concert or what have you (usually a concert), would involve a stop here. 

These days, taking the opposite journey (for a visit home to the suburbs), I still regularly partake in the glory of their burgers when my mom fetches me from the subway station. They are of the thinner, fast food joint school of burgers, as opposed to the thicker, more homemade-tasting chunky school of burgers (think: how Lick's used to make them...then, think of the opposite). Please note that I equally love both kinds of burgers.

 Everything is priced separately, sadly no combos to speak of, so it's a bit more expensive to get the burger, side, and a drink than some other places. The service can be somewhat surly, but also nice when it matters so I know they like me anyway. The onion rings are particularly good, and were the first onion rings to convince me that they were worth choosing (which they SO are), or at least sacrificing half of your fries for."}
{"text":"Good neighbourhood joint! Old school feel- not because they are trying to but because it is. 
Burgers are tasty , not exceptional but def. better then going to McDonald's or Burger King, make sure you order onion rings 
They don't accept plastic so remember  to bring cash .
Ideal for late night cravings"}
{"text":"This is a case of great food overshadowed by bad service. How do you screw up a fast food 2 minute interaction with a customer you ask? Make them feel really uncomfortable!

I get asked on an almost daily basis where I am from. I play dumb and say New Brunswick (which is true) meanwhile I know far too well what they really want to ask is \"what race are you\".  Usually when I say Haitian and Scottish people say things like \"Oh, that's an interesting mix\" or \"gee I've never encountered that before\" and my personal favourite \"no wonder you are so beautiful!\"

Today, while waiting for my Grilled Chicken burger, the guy at the counter asked me where I was from. He had been starring at me since I walked in and I already felt a little uneasy about ordering from him. Once I told him I was mixed he exclaimed \"Wow, you're fucked up!\" I did an awkward laugh, and he proceeded to tell me my laugh was fucked up too.

At this point I just want to get my burger and leave, but he continued, and the questions/comments got weird...

Guy: Oh so that's why your eyes look Asian...
Me: Uhhhh... what?!
Guy: and your hair is like that....
Me: Yeah I guess so
Guy: So your dad's from Haitia? 
Me: Um... it's Haiti
Guy: Do you speak Scottish?
Me: No! Is Scottish a language?
Guy: Do you like your mom's side of the family or dad's side of the family better?

Thank god my burger was ready by this time. 
The burger itself was good and I like that they used real chicken breast instead of a shitty patty. They don't take debit so I had to take cash out of their ATM machine. Will I go back here? Maybe, but probably not... I am not that big into burgers and although I don't think this guy was trying to be racist, the whole ordeal was awkward and left a bad taste in my mouth!"}
{"text":"I can see why this place is an institution in Toronto but its still not the most fantastic burger by any means.  The onion rings are hand dipped but you may want to share an order of them, there is soooo much batter that you can feel your arteries clogging as you swallow (not that that is necessarily a bad thing).  

The burger itself was neither here nor there.  It was hot, greasy, and tasted good.

The staff seemed to be a little disorganized and because of that a large line began to form.  There was also one staff member that just seemed to be complaining that she had already been there all day and wasn't staying much longer so the other staff needed to \"figure it out\".  Not a good impression to put on your guests."}
{"text":"I really wanted a great burger and rings, which are so hard to find these days.

The Apache burger with cheese and bacon was ok.  Very limited toppings.  Given they only take cash and prices are the cheap, they could use more toppings, including real cheddar. 

Onion rings were terrible.  Very thick breading, but almost no onion in the middle.  The poutine looked reasonable, I wish I'd ordered that. 

Don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. I'd put it on par with 5 guys or In and Out. Love the decor, like an old school burger joint. More expensive than McDonalds (which is not really in the same category as this place), but not overly expensive."}
{"text":"I love this classic burger place.. an absolute guilty pleasure on your diet cheat day.

I came here on a Sunday afternoon around 1pm and that's when the second lunch rush started coming in. I'd say there's seats for about 10-15 people comfortably, so seats are a bit scarce but a lot of customers take out anyway so I don't think that's a real issue.

I had the signature Apache burger which is two burger patties with cheddar cheese (absolutely sinful) because I also got the fries and gravy.

Flame grilled burgers as re the bomb and I'll definitely visit this place again when I am in Etobicoke.

Pro tip: CASH OR DEBIT ONLY. BRING YOUR MONIES!!"}
{"text":"This is a Toronto classic. To be honest going here is more about the childhood memories than anything else really. If you're going to order anything other than a burger, don't. Just go somewhere else. These guys do one thing very well and it's their burgers. Their hours are also great since they close just after the subway closes, so hey those late night munchies"}
{"text":"I give this place 3 1/2 stars.

Nice, thick-cut fries and gravy. Decent shakes. But the banquet burger was kinda bland if you ask me. I'll take a Five Guys burger any day.

Having said that, where else are you going to go for something decent to eat in Etobicoke at 2:30 in the morning??"}
{"text":"not a fan, i dont believe the hype, this has been a landmark of Etobicoke for a couple of decades now, and i cant understand why, everything that i ordered was pretty plain and Luke warm at best, when you see the walls of this place you see all the famous people who have ran through, and it just fascinates me, i feel like asking these famous people if they have been back since, i know that might seem a bit harsh but i don't see how this place is any better then mcdonalds, cause from what i tasted and saw, its not.
lots of parking, the service is lack luster, and the staff seemed pretty grumpy, a pale  comparison in retrospect of the \"owner\" in the photos."}
