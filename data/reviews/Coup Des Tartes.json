{"text":"Unique food, great atmosphere, pricey but worth a trip for special occasions."}
{"text":"I'm always excited to go here! It's small and romantic. What I really like about this place is that the menu is seasonal and features really fresh produce and sometimes organic as well. the food is yummy but a bit pricey. Its a BYOB so that definitely helps. I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Four letters - L-O-V-E! We went to Coup Des Tartes last night and have nothing but great things to say about this little place in Uptown Phoenix. The dining room is charming and comfortable, the service is excellent....and the food, oh, my! Salad and starters were yummy, but not amazing. For this visit, the amazing-ness started at the entrees. I had the sea bass with mango salsa and hubby had the filet. Both were expertly prepared and delicious. My sea bass was like butter, melted in my mouth - so good! My husband said the steak was the best he has had! It's topped with a yummy garlic-y butter which as perfect! Now, moving on to desserts: THIS is were it really gets good! I had the chocolate and salted caramel tart with fleur de sel...OMG! This was absolutely amazing! It was very rich and chocolate-y, very sweet with caramel and just a little salty - perfect! I ate every last crumb! (although I did allow my husband to have a single taste...) My husband had the banana brulee, another really great dessert - he liked it a lot, but admitted mine was better.  We brought our own bottle of wine...that was really nice since I was able to bring one of my faves that's not always on restaurant wine lists.   I will go back again and again. It's a great date night spot, but also a great place to meet girlfriends or take out of town guests."}
{"text":"Went here with the Supper Club in September for a 6:30pm dinner. This is now one of my fave restaurants.  Since this place doesn't serve alcohol but offers a BYOL option, one of the gals brought two bottles of white wine for our dinner. ($10 corking fee)  We started off with the Brie brulee ($12), which was warmed and served with a side of caramelized apples, toast, a sliced pear, a strawberry, and grapes. I could have eaten a plate of this and called it a meal; simple, but so delicious!  We ordered three entrees, the Alaskan halibut ($34), lamb shank ($24), and the pork tenderloin ($26). The halibut sat on a bed of mashed potatoes and was topped with a roasted red pepper sauce and shrimp - and was served with grilled vegetables. The fish was flaky, light, and tasted like heaven. The pork tenderloin was cooked and seasoned perfectly - very moist! I'm not a fan of lamb dishes, but the lamb shank was pretty flavorful - and not gamey as I expected it to be.   We usually skip dessert, but decided to try the chocolate torte (flourless). The torte was topped with fresh vanilla ice cream, a side of chocolate drizzle and raspberries - loved the mint used as decoration.   Our waitress was very attentive and made us feel at ease. The owner came by to talk to us and took some pics for us, before and after our dinner. The ambiance of this place is AMAZING - very European. There is even outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Incredible dinner!  Coup Des Tartes knocked restaurant week out of the park.  Fine dining with a casual atmosphere.  Food was delicious and Andrea, our waitress, was top notch!  Can't wait to come back and explore the menu some more."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for Valentine's Day and it was Awesome! The food was amazing - It was a fixed price 4 course meal - and everything we ate was cooked perfectly... I had the mushroom tarte to start and the BF had scallops that he said was the best thing he ate all night... we both had the tomato bisque and then he had Lobster while I chose the Osso Buco with black truffle risotto - absolutely melt in your mouth... we finished with the Banana Brulee which lived up to the reviews posted...  Our server was very sweet and attentive  My only complaints were that we were packed in like sardines... takes intimate to a whole new level - at least our table mates weren't complete jerks ;-) and that I felt a little rushed through... the meals came out so quick and so did the check... It was a busy night I'm sure, but I would have liked to savor the tastes a bit before being rolled out...   On the whole though I was happy and sated: We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm a little confused about some of the complaints Coup Des Tartes is receiving. First of all, I think their food pricing is very reasonable. I don't know too many places in town where you can order a $30 steak and get two sides without an additional charge for said sides. Second. I cannot believe anyone is complaining about the corkage fee! Restaurants traditionally double the price of wine on a menu so here is your golden opportunity to bring an awesome bottle of wine and ONLY pay an additional $10 fee! I would imagine if you brought a $10 bottle of wine you would be miffed...but just don't do that! Splurge a little! That $50 bottle would cost you $100 plus anywhere else!  Plus, since this little establishment does not have a license to sell wine, they are losing a ton of money that they could profit from if they did. I'm just saying. I, for one, appreciate only having a $10 markup on my wine.   Anyway, I have been to this cute little place several times and am always thrilled. We were there a few weeks back for my husband's birthday and again had a wonderful experience. I started with the scrumptious Three Onion Tart, yum, all for myself! Sweet and savory and decadent...just how I like it! Paco (my hubby) ordered the Mozzarella and Tomato Salad which he said was \"superb\". For our entrees, birthday boy had the Filet Mignon, expertly prepared and  cooked rare, to his liking. I had the excellent Lamb Shank, which was extremely meaty and fall off the bone tender. I thought the sauce was excellent. However, I'm old school and prefer the smaller grain of couscous. This trend of the larger grained Israeli couscous doesn't thrill me, but c'est la vie. My meal was still delicious, just a personal preference. For desert, we kicked it Frenchie style and ordered the \"Interesting Cheese\" platter; which helped us finish off our amazing 2001 Heitz Cellar Cabernet ($60 at Total Wine plus paltry $10 corkage fee) in style. Yum.   Also...thanks for lovely service, a great birthday, and our delightful maitre de from Manchester...we loved meeting you!"}
{"text":"Ohh la la! This place made me want to learn French. I went there with my bro and sis- in laws as well as my mother in law and my husband. We each brought in our own bottle of wine. I love BYOBs because you can really splurge on your food AND drink delicious wines. This place did the trick! We had the Interested Cheeses (my sis-in-law and I love cheese) and the Filet Mignon taco for starters. I can't vouch for the tacos, but I think my husband would have fought me for it.   For our entrees I had the salmon which was cooked to perfection! I even ended up eating off other plates with salmon after they were full I loved it so much! My husband loved the Filet Mignon as well. I do think it was here where he discovered he really did like salmon.   Of course, we had to have dessert, too! We got the chocolate mocha and the four berry tartes. Even if you are full, get a tarte to go!   I really want to go back to try the farfalle..Maybe this weekend??  I guess it is good for groups but call ahead. Its a tight squeeze!"}
{"text":"Our experience at Coup des Tartes for our 4 year anniversary was the best dining experience we've ever had, hands down.  The food was absolutely amazing--we had escargot, the three onion tarte, the filet mignon, the duck and the caramel salted creme brulee.  Each one of these dishes was so good they almost overwhelmed us!  My partner is a student at Le Cordon Bleu and she was very inspired by every aspect of the restaurant.  The service was so attentive and friendly--as a gay couple, we did not feel out of place at all.  In fact, between the server and the owner, we must have had 10 pictures taken trying to get the perfect shot--they did not make us feel as if we were inconveniencing them at all.  The atmosphere was romantic and homey with cozy rooms seating a few tables...we loved this design.  Though it was too hot to eat outdoors, we remarked on how chic and lovely the outdoor dining area was and are giving serious thought to getting married there!  In fact, the owner himself suggested his restaurant as a wedding venue for us.  Though we seldom have the money to spend on extravagant dinners (although we felt the price for our dinner was very reasonable...maybe even underpriced for the outstanding quality), we will be putting what we can into our foodie fund to make it a point to visit Coup des Tartes at least a few times a year.  Thank you and Bravo!"}
{"text":"Was here again tonight for the Prixe Fix meal! Amazing as always.  Chevre Tomato- Amazing creamy goat cheese on toast points with fab tomatoes. Very mild, even my goat-hating hubby liked it. I only wished there was just one more! The mixed greens were a simple but perfect addition to the appetizer. Three Onion Tarte- Oh my god, foodgasm. I have got to learn how to make something vaguely similar. Sweet, savory, creamy... amazing. I could eat this all day every day until the end of time and be happy.  Duck with Rhubarb Glaze- Simply amazing. Not gamey or greasy at all, the glaze perfect. The honey had caramelized and left a delicious crust at the bottom, Oh man. The potatoes are sinfully good as always, and the green beans so fresh and crisp it took me back to days on the Farm. Fettucine- Not a thick creamy sauce, so don't expect it. Fabulous just the same, but didn't hold the wow factor that the duck did.  Lamb- I've had it before, and assuming nothing has changed, this is a large portion and very hearty, just fabulous, a real joy if you love lamb. The couscous and ragout is sooo good, it had the lady at the table next to me moaning. See? Foodgasm. Its real.  We then added on the interesting cheese platter, something I highly recommend doing if you have the belly for it, and describing it would take me an hour so I'll just leave you to explore that yourself ;)  We had the salted caramel/chocolate tarte and the four berry tarte. I LOVE anything containing \"salt\" \"caramel\" and/or \"chocolate\" and this had it all. Sticks to your teeth and speaks to a woman's soul. Don't be afraid of the salt, ladies... chocolate looooves salt. So does caramel. What more do you want!? The four berry tarte was much lighter and a bit warm with wonderful vanilla bean ice cream, but it is what it is and nothing more... but hubby loved it.  Thank you Coup des Tartes for yet another lovely evening with your wonderful attentive staff and your fabulous food. You made my hubby's birthday. Faneffingtastic!"}
{"text":"I love this place and everyone who works there. We were no less than 20 minutes late for our reservation, and they were hilarious about it. Not at all pretentious or exclusive. We immediately felt at ease instead of any place in Scottsdale that would make you feel like you needed to fall on your knees and beg their forgiveness for have the audacity of living a busy life. The food was great, we're going back this week with the in-laws. Easy environment, comfortable place, affordable only because they lack a liquor license and it forces you to drink water."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for out anniversary dinner, and we had an amazing experience. The waiters and waitresses were very attentive and the food was delicious. My favorite dish was the pork tenderloin, it was cooked perfectly, the mashed potatoes were nice and \"fluffy\", and the green beans were cooked nicely. We had dessert at the bar and happened to sit down as business was starting to slow down for the night and happened to sit with the owners. Between them and the bartender Derrick, the just made the experience that much better. They are extremely friendly and hospitable. They really made us feel welcome for the 3 hours we ended up hanging out there and chatting. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time on Friday night enjoying a nice glass of wine and wonderful music on the patio for happy hour. The duo played nicely and appropriately for the beautiful ambiance of the patio. Then moved inside for dinner where the meal was wonderful. French onion soup, lamb shank all wonderful. To add to it all, the service was great too. Very attentive. Thanks. See you again very soon."}
{"text":"French is my favorite cuisine.  A foodie friend raved about this place and the same night they were featured on \"Check Please,\" so I knew I had to go. It was absolutely outstanding, tres  magnifique! The ambiance was very warm and quaint and the food was superb.  We had the 3 onion tart and the duck breast and sea bass... All cooked perfectly!  The service was excellent.  Nicole, our server was very knowledgable and passionate which added to a wonderful evening.  She recommended the pear tart for dessert and it was sooooo good!  We will return."}
{"text":"The Dinner dined at CDT on Thursday, April 29th for Dining Out for Life. First of all, props to this restaurant, and all valley restaurants, who agreed to donate 25% of their sales on this day to AIDS research and support organizations. Now, on to the food!  We started with the Brie Brulee....nothing special, just a wedge of brie that had been warmed a bit in the microwave. Nothing that hasnt been done before (and better, by restaurants like Arcadia Farms). If I were you I would try something else, like the Pate or 3 Onion Tarte, but I couldn't talk any of my fellow diners into trying them...I guess they were feeling unadventurous.   next course was the soup, that evening was roasted red pepper and tomato, which was quite good...fresh and flavorful...and the signature gorgonzola salad, which i think was the highlight of the meal. I will be back, if only for the salad!!  Main course: 3 of us tried the pecan crusted chicken....which was flavorful, moist and tender, and was complemented well by the raspberry chipotle sauce it is topped with. The Chilean Sea Bass was good, but not great...the middle-eastern flavors of the dish didnt seem to complement the fish all that well....and the filet itself was good, but was drowned in an overpowering mustard sauce which overwhelmed the whole dish.   Dessert: the highlight of the mean (other than the salad). They offered a selection of 4 tartes that evening, and we chose 3. The apple tarte, the samoa (for the best girl scout cookie ever) and a chocolate hazelnut tarte. Delish....everyone had a different favorite, but if you happen to think that the Samoa is the only girl-scout cookie worth ordering when those scouts come knocking, then you will die for the samoa tart.  Overall: good food in a cute environment. Great salad and great dessert. This place is billed as \"romantic\" but we didn't find anything romantic about the place...lots of tables in a small space...and some of the entrees could use a little but more finishing.   Overall rating = 3.5 stars, rounding up because of the desserts and the restaurant's participation in such a good cause!"}
{"text":"Dining at Coup Des Tartes last night was treat for all my senses. It's a cute art nouveau style home made into a restaurant and they have a separate room that can accommodate up to 40 people for a private party. The presentation of the food would make all the Iron Chef's proud and flavor beyond belief!!  We started with the Brie Brulee which was so delicious. The combination of the creamy flavor from the cheese with the caramelized apples was sinfully good. We both could have eaten the entire order but new we needed to save room for the entrees. The entrees we decided upon, and it was a tough decision,  were Duck in a Rhubarb glaze and the Filet Migon in horseradish creme fraiche. Both dishes were prepared perfectly medium rare as we ordered. We were both stuffed at this point but after watching the tables around us receiving their dessert course we just had to take a peak. All of the items sounded great but we opted for the lemon goat cheese cheesecake with a hazelnut crust. This dessert was so delicious - the lemon was sweet and the goat cheese gave it just the right hint of sharpness. I would have never thought these ingredients could taste so good together.  Not only were we thoroughly impressed with the cuisine, the service was great. They were very attentive but not to the point of bothering us. The only thing missing was a great bottle of wine in which we didn't bring...our bad."}
{"text":"There was no one at the front desk. The walk to the front door was  awful. It took 30 minutes to get our cocktails. I had to ask for bread. The filet  minion was mushy...and it took another 30 minutes for dessert.  Oh yeah and our wine was not served directly to us because they said our cork was dry...but they didn't show us!!! Don't even bother with this restaurant...there are others that are a thousand times better."}
{"text":"Oh this place is so good.  Finally made the Hubs take me during Yelp week - and he too is glad I forced the issue.  At first, I wasn't totally sold on the ambiance of the place, but as the night continued (and the wine flowed) I found myself more and more happy.  We ordered the baked brie & onion tarte as appetizers. DELICIOUS. Ugh, just writing about them makes me want to go back and get more...   The hubs ordered the filet, and I ordered the salmon. Both were perfection. The sides were also delicious, and the portions were just right.   For dessert we ordered the four-berry tarte, which too was freaking incredible. I mean seriously, everything they brought out of the kitchen was just fantastic.   I can't wait to \"drag\" the hubs back. :) Hopefully SOON."}
{"text":"Ok, before I begin, I just want to say that I am not a picky eater nor am I a high-maintenance patron.  I'll eat almost everything (from innards and entrails to brain to raw meat), and my expectations for service is not that high.  But I was a little disappointed with my recent experience at Coup des Tartes.  My husband and I dined at Coup de Tartes on 9/25/15, our first time to Arizona for our 20th anniversary.  I made reservations through Open Table over a month in advance.  We had studied their menu and arrived having already decided on our choices for dinner.  We knew that we were arriving during AZ's Restaurant Week and that Coup des Tartes was a participating restaurant, but we were surprised to learn upon arrival that they had completely eliminated their regular menu and were only offering select entrees during Restaurant Week.  Needless to say, we were not able to order the items we were looking forward to try. We were limited to just a few choices and our tab for the three course meal was more than what it would have cost if we'd been offered the full menu and ordered a la carte.  I don't want or need dessert, thank you!  Anyway, dinner was a little disappointing.  I chose the pear salad (very good!) and hubby selected the lobster pot pie.  It tasted like canned clam chowder with a pot pie crust.  I'm not exaggerating.  For his main entrée, hubby selected the Moroccan lamb with couscous (pretty good) and I selected the white fish dish (I forget the name of it).  The fish was cold and the sauce tasted like heated tartar sauce with added herbs.  Not too impressive.  It was served with some potatoes (eh!) and the thinnest, most overcooked asparagus I'd ever seen.  The asparagus were grilled beyond edible.  It was just charred and string-y.  Service was not great either.  The owner (Ron, I think his name is) didn't acknowledge us for several minutes when we arrived.  Once seated, we noticed that Ron was very friendly with the patrons who were dining next to us, but he didn't check on us once.  I ordered a Coup 75 with one waitress but another waitress brought me a different drink.  Good thing I noticed before I took a sip.  They did take it back but my Coup 75 wasn't brought to me until I was already halfway through my meal.  A male waiter then took over.  He brought us the wrong desserts.  When we mentioned it, he said \"Oh, sorry.  They must have given me the wrong order\".  I chose the salted caramel tart (good), and hubby had the crème brulee cheesecake (not extraordinary).  Overall, it was \"OK\", but I would not return again!  After all the good reviews we'd read, it just did not live up to our expectations."}
{"text":"Went there for my wife's birthday tonight. What a great little place that is actually and 1930's home. We were lucky to be served by the owner tonight. I had the Arugula and Tomato salad which was very delicious. Everything about the salad was fresh and tasty. My wife had the Lobster Risotto and i had the house special, Lamb Shank. The Lamb shank was quite different than what i may usually order, and i was very pleased with the dish. The lamb was so was so tender, and mixed with the vegetables and couscous, just melted in my mouth.  For dessert, we had the banana brulee, and the owner, Ron, was thoughtful enough to bring it out on a birthday platter with a candle.  I would definitely recommend this charming little French Bistro."}
{"text":"Looked forward to a beautiful May evening dining on the patio which ended up being a disappointing experience.  First, the patio was sorely understaffed and the service painfully slow and disjointed.  When our entrees finally arrived, while flavorful they were all served lukewarm taking away from the quality.  Even the coffee was weak and served lukewarm.  Highlight of the evening was the four berry tarte which was exceptional but not good enough to recommend this restaurant to friends.  Never mind paying for good food and service but this was not the case.  There are too many good restaurant choices in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Really overrated.  The owner told me his lamb was the best.  I don't think so! Lamb shank was mediocre with a dull and thin flavored brown sauce. The pork had little flavor.  The bread is weak too. What's best is the way they source their food. Grass-fed, organic etc. All in all its no big deal. They can do a lot better and so can you!!"}
{"text":"Lovely restaurant with exceptional food. I immensely enjoyed their recent $27 Prix Fix meal - BYOB of course. The ambiance and service make this restaurant a MUST for special occasions.  I've done Mother's Day, Birthdays, Anniversaries and more and have been pleased with their extraordinary service and food. Highly recommended in my book if you're looking for a romantic, quiet restaurant that serves only the freshest, best local food available. LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Pro: byo, the owner is hands on and hustles, friendly servers.   diverse menu and all in our group of 6 were pleased with apps/salads/entrees/desserts.   Con: a little cramped in spots  Good special date spot and 4-8 person celebration spot where you can bust out a great bottle from your own cellar."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night and it was delicious!! Super cute, intimate old house restaurant centrally located on 16th, just south of Highland. Best part....(and if you've read my other reviews this will be a shocker!)....it's BYOB!! There is a $9 corkage fee without a limit on the number of bottles you bring in to enjoy. Love it!!   So, BF and I started with the daily soup...white tuscan bean...delicious!! They were super accommodating for his GF food allergy and we nearly licked the bowl clean! We then split the tomato & mozzarella salad which had fantastic, fresh mozzarella. It was awesome!   For dinner, we shared the pork tenderloin and it was cooked perfectly and the potatoes were incredible! Obviously very rich (I'm guessing cream cheese and sour cream), but they were ridiculous!   I had been eyeing the cheese plate as many other groups were enjoying it, so we decided to take one to go! It's a bit pricey ($18), but the 4 cheeses they selected were so good (Humboldt Fog Goat with ash, Parm Reg, an awesome creamy, brie like cheese and another yummy one with golden raisins) plus it was accompanied by great, buttery toast points with dried cranberries, apricots and fresh pears, apples and strawberries. It was soo good!   One thing that we didn't try, but would like to, is they are known for their tarts. They have a selection of about 5 each day, with one daily special (yesterday being smores...what!?!) and they look amazing!   Such a great little place!"}
{"text":"Was very excited about trying this place after seeing good reviews.  The service was great but I have had better food at a truck stop in Arkansas.  Atmosphere is great but not worth the money to order the food.  BYOB but only order the appetizers!"}
{"text":"Beautiful, Intimate, and cozy are just a few words to describe the new and improved Coup Des Tartes atmosphere.  Then there is the FOOD and Service- Wonderful!  The menu is expanded, and all delicious.  I had the crab cakes, roquefort salad with toasted hazelnuts and roasted duck breast.  It was all divine!  Can't wait to go back to try more dishes.  The bar is also welcoming with many handcrafted cocktails by the gracious Helena.  Then there are the desserts/tartes they are famous for and Jessica the original pastry chef is there to prepare them. This whole relocation and project has been a labor of love, but it has been worth it!  Don't miss the opportunity to check this out, before you have to wait forever to get a reservation.  It is so unique- nothing like it I have seen in Phoenix.  Ron ( the owner) will be there to welcome you and share his vision come to life so you can experience it as well.  It will become a Favorite- I am positive!"}
{"text":"Really cozy restaurant. Definitely need to make a reservation in advance and you can do it online through OpenTable or something similar. There is a Total Wine fairly close by so we stopped there right before since the place is BYOB. We ordered the onion tarte; delicious and classically French. The onions weren't overly powerful and were sweet. I ordered a fish dish with rice and tomatoes - very simple, but delicious. My husband ordered the filet; just a touch too salty but really tender and flavorful. And the best part, the dessert! We ordered a pear crumble dessert and it melted in our mouths. One of the best desserts I've ever had. Definitely a splurge, but worth it! The service was first-class."}
{"text":"Visited on a Thursday evening with my picky MIL. Such an intimate dining experience. The Roquefort salad was yummy and filing. Had the sea bass with curried crab meat as a main course. Shouldn't have eaten it all as it was a decent size but just couldn't stop! MIL had the lamb which is a menu staple. Meat was tender and hearty. Can't wait until the fall to sit on the patio. Service was impeccable!"}
{"text":"The food was good and the bistro was very clean and cozy. Service was slow, however it was brunch on Sunday and Father's day. I'll cut'em some slack. I'll be going back on a normal day."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give five stars because for the most part, we had an amazing dinner. We had two appetizers but the onion tart was my favorite and definitely lived up to the hype. I had the chicken and instead of saving half for left overs, I ate it all. My friends had the filet and the salmon which were delicious too. Finished it all off with a tasty cappuccino and the lemon tart. Which was good until I got a mouthful of plastic. When we told one of the servers, she didn't seem too surprised, shrugged and said \"Oh no, that's too bad.\" And that was that. It wasn't taken away, replaced, or removed from our considerable bill. For what we paid, I would have at least liked an acknowledgement for the mistake. If I do go back, it won't be for a while."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to book this restaurant for our 5 year anniversary.  We had an amazing night with the service, the staff and especially the food!  We could not stop raving how amazing the fish and chicken dishes were.  And the tart for dessert was even personalized for our anniversary.  So worth every penny and more!"}
{"text":"One of the best onion tarts I have ever eaten. I would take a picture but I ate it all.."}
{"text":"This is a nice neighborhood cafe. I would pick it for an intimate outing anytime.  The food is decent. It's not going to knock ones socks off. It's eclectic. Little bit of Asian, Italian, and French flavors, dished out in a safe manner. Nothing to weird, out there or otherwise too creative.  My only complaint regarding food was that I was not asked how I'd like my pork tenderloin cooked. Being that it's a solid piece of meat with no fat in it, cooking it well done doesn't help any.   Service is very good, with our server explaining each dish as they hit the table.   All and all, this place's ambiance makes it a decent place to take a lovely lady, or handsome man."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I have been there but this place is easily one of my favorite places for a nice slow night with friends. The absolute best part for me is the BYOB feature, having an educated palatte when it comes to the vino makes it really hard to get wine at most places for decent prices. This way, I bring what I want, period. Sure, if you bring a 10 dollar bottle of wine, it seems counter intuitive to pay another 9- except many places would charge you 28 for the wine you brought.   The food is fantastic, and the speed of service is perfect, meaning, if you want the server to leave you alone for a time and let you enjoy yourself, you will not even have to ask. This place does it right."}
{"text":"Appetizer Escargot is insanely delicious! Then on to main course of Squash Couscous with seared Schallops...Amazing!"}
{"text":"We had a very nice Birthday celebration at Coup De Tarts. The food and service was is amazing impeccable. I highly recommend this fine dining experience"}
{"text":"When we arrived, from the front of the building...it didn't look very promising and my heart kinda sank a little.  But once we got inside the courtyard...I actually felt like I was in Paris (except for the dry AZ heat).  We (there were three of us) took a table outside near the fountain and since it was BYOB and I had printed out a coupon for the free corking fee, we brought a bottle to accompany our meal.  For starters, we had the cheese plate & the pate...and it was delish.  I got the duck and it was perfectly crispy on the outside, moist on the inside and full of flavors.  I don't recall what my companions had...but they equally enjoyed their meals.  Consistent w/the service in Paris, we found the wait staff here to be efficient & brisk.  My boyfriend is not a fan of uppity fancy restaurants...but he also really enjoyed the food and experience here."}
{"text":"Having enjoyed the original location so much, our party of three went - sans reservation - on a recent weekend evening. We do that from time to time. We know going in there may be no room, or a very long wait. We were fine with rolling the dice, hoping we could nab a table at the new location.  Like most others, we like the new location. It's a bistro of sorts, so yeah the tables are close together, just like most other bistros. The patio looks great and with cooler weather coming will no doubt be crowded.  Once we entered and stood at the reception table there was no one there to greet us. Staff running around (the place was fairly busy although the bar was completely empty) but no one acknowledging us. After a few minutes a harried hostess greeted us and we told her we knew that without a reservation we might have to wait a while, or maybe the place was fully booked. She told us to wait and she would see what she could do.   After 20 minutes and no sight of the hostess we figured we wouldn't get in. Hey, no problem, that happens from time to time (but what about the empty tables in the bar?). Here's what got us: when the hostess came back after those 20 minutes she told us that \"even with a reservation it is sketchy getting a table.\" Pardon me? Are you telling me it is troublesome getting a table even with a reservation? If that's the case what's the point of reserving a table? For that matter, what's the point of coming back?  So, in fairness, my review isn't for the food (I have no idea if the food is any good), but for the  amateur behavior of the hostess. Should we elect to go back perhaps we'll do so after making one of those \"sketchy\" reservations."}
{"text":"My wife and i went to Coup De Tartes for our second anniversary and we weren't disappointed.  We were seated outside and created a nice atmosphere with the lights and the fountain, perfect for our evening. I would probably only want to sit outside unless it was super hot.  The service was very good. Our server was very attentive.  As for the food, it was very excellent! My steak was really good. My plate also had mashed potatoes and spinach.  I just wish I had more when I was done, but was quite full after the meal and some bread beforehand.  MY wife had the house special of the evening-halibut and said it was one best good fish she's had.  We ended the evening with dessert. I was only going to have a bite or two, but after my first bite of the berry tart, I changed my mind and ended up eating more, much to the chagrin of my wife.  The only downside is parking. There is only a selected amount of spots.  Make sure to make reservations and bring your own wine/beer."}
{"text":"Great patio.  The fireplace is a nice touch.  The sea scallops were awesome.  I would definitely come back.  Service was great."}
{"text":"Fabulous! This was our first real meal at CDT since it reopened at its new location. It used to be, and now is again, one of our favorites and we were waiting for them to settle in to their new home. Great food, fabulous ambiance, and unmatched service. My partner has a lot of allergies (shellfish and gluten, just to name a couple), and our server, Jessica, and the kitchen were very patient and accommodating. The chocolate hazelnut torte is to die for!"}
{"text":"Coup Des Tartes is a lovely little gem in the heart of Phoenix. The restaurant itself is an old 1930's farmhouse -- small and quaint. I've read some other reviews that described it as cramped (which I can understand), but my husband and I were placed at a very romantic table in the corner and felt very cozy. This is a beautiful local to celebrate a romantic occasion (my husband took me for New Years eve).   Our highlights were the Brie Brulee and Mushroom Tart (which I don't think is a permanent fixture on the menu). The desserts were to-DIE-for! I swear, I'm still savoring the raspberry chocolate torte. Some day, I want to return for a 3-course dessert-for-dinner meal.   One important note: The restaurant is BYOB. The only self- conscious moment was when I felt neighboring tables giving our wine the once-over.  Given I'm uneducated when it comes to wine selection, I'm hoping my husband selected a \"nice\" wine from our selection and that we were getting approving looks from those tables...but heck, who cares!  I loved the service, the ambiance and the food!"}
{"text":"Great intimate dinner for a perfect date night! Great wine selection and dinner was fabulous!!"}
{"text":"Love this place every time I am in AZ i eat there.  Tarts are the best ever.  Holly Synergy World"}
{"text":"My parents took me here to celebrate my college graduation, and had they taken me here BEFORE they got me a present, there would have been no need.....This was place AMAZING!  I love the atmosphere of the small house. This is a huge part of its charm. The staff was kind, and friendly, and very personable. They unexpectedly brought out a desert for me with a \"Congratulations Graduate\" inscribed with chocolate sauce (bonus!) on the outer rim of the plate. The service alone would make me come back.  But the food. OH. MY. GOD. the FOOD!  I had no expectations going to this restaurant, as i had no idea what it was, or that we were even going until an hour before i arrived. I had no time to do research, and i trust my parents palate to have chosen a sufficient place for dinner. (they did pretty good being from Texas, thanks to you yelpers!)  What we ordered:  To start: the Brie Brulee--INCREDIBLE Three Onion Tart--from the one bite i was able to sneak in from my dad (who fell in love at first taste) it was delicious  I had the Salmon, which was wonderful. Flaky, and moist, and the creme sauce was devine. I don't think i expected it to be as heavy as the dish was, but even so...wonderful. I would probably have enjoyed it more if it were cold outside.  My dad ordered the lamb shank, and it was falling off the bone. I had never had lamb until that day, and i'm glad my first time was at Coup Des Tartes! It was savory, and succulent, and with the vegetables it came with, reminded me of a stew.  My mom had the Pasta, and it was just right! Very light and flavorful, which paired well with the wine we brought.  My brother ordered the Chicken, and while it was one of the \"simpler\" dishes, it was the best tasting of them all.  The execution from start to finish is something that will not go unmentioned when i recommend this little gem. Keep up the great work! I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent, the ambiance cozy.  Great for date night!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for charming places and this is one of them. It's a perfect place for a date, girls lunch or dinner with mom. I live and work near here and can't believe I didn't try it until Spring Restaurant Week!   I loved loved loved everything I ate. I had the ceasar salad and the filet Mignon which was glazed with a delicate wine port sauce - so good that I ate every bite! And I'm super picky about ceasar salads and this was the best one I've ever had. I had the creme brulee for dessert which I didn't love, but everything else made up for it.   I looked at their menu recently since I've been wanting to come back and these items don't appear to be on there - I guess they were a special for Restaurant Week. Kind of a bummer but definitely won't stop me from returning.   With the charming atmosphere, delish dinner and BYOB option - this place has it all!"}
{"text":"Let's  with the positives .... staff very nice, owner very attentive and location very nice.  Now for the food.   1) FRENCH ONION SOUP- blan, onions were not carmelized at all white and translucent yes, stock was almost clear missing the flavor and color from the caramelized onions.  Served so hot it took 20min cooling time to eat (under the broiler too long). 2) ESCARGOT PERSILLADE -  is a dish of panko crusted snails covered with a garlic butter - not a dish of snails smothered in a butter chili sauce.   3) MORROCAN LAMB SHANK - notice the correct spelling of Moroccan.  Interesting idea with the stone fruit.  Lamb shank was dry tough and obviously cooked a second time since it was cold in the middle. Soupy sauce very little flavor and I believe with potatoes as well. This was obviously not a slow braised dish but cooked in bulk and put into the refrig. and re-heated when ordered.  4) Grand Canyon peanut butter and chocolate mousse - though it was  tasty; 1.5 inches of Peanut Butter but only .25 inches of mousse 50/50 would have been nice so the chocolate could have been tasted.   Over all, NOT OK /eatable some what/write home about NO.  For just under $100 I would have expected better from a restaurant with years of experience.  Would I go back No.   My suggestion to owner verify the dishes better with an eye on what you are offering and serving.  I do not enjoy doing a bad review ... but when necessary for the betterment of the establishment I will."}
{"text":"I have been eyeing Coup Des Tartes for several months. My husband passed the bar, so we finally had a legit reason to splurge and celebrate.   Coincidentally it was Restaurant Week. I typically stay away from restaurant week because i feel like it is a good excuse for restaurants to charge more and serve less (and less variety on the menu). Anyhow, I looked online and the menu for RW at CDT seemed pretty decent. And it is BYOB - super thumbs up!  We walked in for our 8pm reservation, and even though there were two women at the counter, who obviously knew we were there, it still took them a minute or two to acknowledge us. Kind of weird, but not a deal killer.   We get seated and instantly fall in love with the ambiance. It is muy romantico. It is also fun to bring your own wine (they do charge a corkage fee).   I was a little disappointed that the only entrees you could order were from the RW menu. But, I should have known better.   We started off with the brie brulee, and I ordered a salad and soup from the non-RW app menu, and my husband ordered the beef tenderloin, medium well.   Everything was two thumbs up until the beef tenderloin came out medium rare. (for real, medium rare). So, we finally were able to flag down the waitress, and she instantly said \"oh, that's medium rare, not medium well\" - right!  So, she takes it back to the kitchen, and returns in minutes....it is obviously the same cut of meat, they just put it back on the grill or nuked it, I don't know. Either way, I feel like if you are going to pay a nice price for dinner, then they should serve you a new cut of meat if they didn't cook it well enough. (it was for sure the same meat....my husband had cut into it previously, and that cut was still there).   Part of the meat was now medium well, part of it not so much, but by this time we were just kind of 'over it.' To top it off, our waitress never asked us to confirm that the meat was to our satisfaction, and when she came to pick up our plates she didn't ask why my husband only ate a fourth of the meat. She seemed very uninterested.   Again, nice ambiance, great appetizers, but I was a little disappointed to drop $100 on dinner and feeling unsatisfied with my meal."}
{"text":"Food was decent B plus. Deserts were excellent. Cutest little converted house.  However no privacy at all. Took my wife for birthday and decided to get up and move to bar when neighbors discussion on euthanasia and hospice became too much for us. Additionally I made a reservation but they had no record of it when we got there though they did seat is immediately. Just did not match up with the expectations and price."}
{"text":"Went for restaurant week. Had the brie to start. Sounded a lot better than it was. Barely warm brie, some dry apples on top, don't know what was carmelized about them, some fruit on the side and some toast. I saw nothing that was bruleed. Dinner partner had the Escargot, which was good. Second course was petite filet mignon. Petite is right! I should have paid better attention to that word. I was pretty surprised at how little it was. It came with decent sauce, three warm tomato slices and maybe 5 small pieces of potato wedge. I've had better steak fries. Disappointed. Dinner partner had the sea bass, nice flavor but also tiny portion!! Other dinner partner had the pasta. That was good and thank goodness he let me have some or I would have stopped at Culver's on the way home. Their fries are better than what I got by the way. Last course was Hazelnut Tarte. Pretty boring chocolate in boring non-flakey pastry with a few pieces of nut on top. Not impressed. Had called previously to see if their portions were smaller for restaurant week. They told me I wouldn't go away hungry. Wrong. Service was lackluster, had to wait quite a while between courses, had to ask for drinks to be refilled.  I'm sad that I wasted one of my restaurant week picks here. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Visited the restaurant tonight and was very pleased.  I found the decor charming and elegant.  The atmosphere is amazing sans the hustle and bustle of most of the local chain like restaurants.  The place was devoid of the stereotypical Scottsdale element we prefer to avoid.  I found the prices easily justifiable in fact I though them quite reasonable.  We had the three onion tart appetizer, which was spectacular. For entrees we had salmon, filet, and a pair of lamb shanks.  Everything was wonderful.  The presentation was clean and the freshness and quality of the proteins, produce and accoutrement's was immediately evident.  Everything was cooked skillfully.  Had three of the four desserts on the menu.  The chocolate raspberry tart definitely stood out followed closely by the berry tart.  Delicately prepared and presented these were really an unexpected treat.  The environment is wonderful for Dining and chatting with people you actually like. The interior is intimate and it lends itself well to the cuisine.  I found the staff courteous, knowledgeable and professional.  We will be frequenting often and I encourage others to visit."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! The service was impeccable! The ambiance was great for a girl's dinner."}
{"text":"We like this place I have Filet Mignon 100% natural grass fed Australian beef topped with a medley of vegetables and a tangy sauce, served Yukon Gold mashed potatoes and my boyfriend *Pork Tenderloin herb marinated pork tenderloin served with Yukon Gold mashed potatoes sautéed haricot verts and finished with a mushroom demi glaze Wong very good too good"}
{"text":"The food and service were absolutely amazing! Derek, our waiter, was friendly and so accommodating with all of our orders. Would definitely come back soon! The croissants are a must to try."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good French restaurant in Phoenix and have finally food it.  If you like French food, you'll love Coup Des Tartes. I went here for restaurant week and the food was fantastic. French food is best know for its flavor and sauces and Coup Des Tartes hits it on the spot! I had the spare ribs, the BF had the filet and they were cooked to perfection with a light tomato base sauce on mine and grilled onions on his.  For dessert we had the cream brûlée and the chocolate carmel tart. The cream brûlée was good but the chocolate carmel tart was awesome!  I'm going back this weekend and taking my family. The service was average but the owner was very nice. Nice ambiance too, romantic but also family worthy. I wouldn't bring small kids, the restaurant is small and the tables are close together just like the authentic French restaurant feeling.  Bon a petite"}
{"text":"What a delightful and cozy find.    Our meal was clever and delicious.   And the owner and server made our experience extra special!"}
{"text":"My favorite French spot in Phoenix. Every meal has been excellent (yes, the three onion tart appetizer is great - along with every other menu item) and I love that they let you bring your own alcohol."}
{"text":"Delicious food and excellent staff make this small French restaurant worthy of five stars. We began with a glass of fabulous wine that we brought (it is byob) and ordered the onion tart as an appetizer. The taste of the leeks coupled with the cheese, buttery and flaky pastry made this one of the most tasty ways to start a meal. I ordered the marinated chicken. This dish came with a juicy chicken breast with a light pesto sauce, mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach. The flavors intermingled to create a sensuous bite, time and time again. My girlfriend got the filet, which was juicy and flavorful and came with perfectly roasted potatoes and tomatoes. For dessert we ordered the tart of the day, which was fruit and coconut cream on top of a shortbread-tasting tart. Just delicious. The service was wonderful, very efficient and friendly. It is not cheap, it was $99 for the appetizer, two entrees and dessert...but for the experience and the exquisite flavors, I will go back for any special occasion... guaranteed."}
{"text":"Food:  Five Stars Service:  Sub-par  I had heard so many good things about this place so I was really looking forward to going for my birthday.  I ordered the filet and my husband ordered the chicken cordon bleu.  They bring out the meals, oops, the server brought out two filets.  What happened to the chicken cordon bleu?  The server misheard what my husband ordered and got the order wrong.  Then she proceeds to say, sorry they are OUT of the chicken cordon bleu.  Okay, disappointing but he orders the salmon dish.  In the mean time he shares my meal with me.  I really hate it when this happens.  They bring out his salmon only to find that it is raw and cold on the inside.  Once again we have to send his dish back.  Finally, a new plate arrives.  It is cooked perfectly and is delicious, as was my meal.  It just took forever to get it right.  The owner came to the table and apologized, which we appreciated, but rather than comp my husband's meal, he offers a free dessert.  I guess something is better than nothing but I really felt that our situation called for my husband's dish to be at no cost to us.     So the food was great, everything I expected, but getting the order RIGHT was challenging."}
{"text":"Well, there aren't many places that let you bring your own wine to the table in Phoenix, and the food is great as well.  Coup Des Tartes has a distinctly Napa Vally feel to the ambiance.  The food is very good, though not among the best in Phoenix, and reasonably priced.  A truly fun and magical place to take someone special.  You have to try it for yourself!  One of my favorites for a nice, slow, date."}
{"text":"My wife and I always look forward to our experience at Coups Des Tartes and we were not disappointed with our latest dinner.   We booked online for an 8pm table and were our table was ready when we arrived. The owner greeted us and thanked us for coming again. We thought this was really nice.   Our server was fantastic and invited us to open our wine while our Brie Brulee was prepared. She also suggested the special lamb appetizer. Both were absolutely delicious. The Brie plate was so good our neighbors at an adjacent table decided to order it for their post-meal cheese.   As we filled up on starters we decided to split the Filet Mignon. We ordered it medium-rare and it was cooked to perfection. We also asked for a side of butternut squash risotto and it was some of the best risotto we've had outside of Italy.   One cannot eat at Coups Des Tartes and skip dessert, so we went with the Pumpkin Tarte served with fresh cream and a light coating of candied pecans. It was an outstanding post meal sweet.    Coups Des Tartes is a great place for a romantic meal. We can't wait until our next meal.   Five stars all the way!"}
{"text":"A very disappointing Mother's Day was spent here waiting and waiting for our food to be served.   When it reached us, a seemingly inexperienced server reached across guests, did not return with answers to questions asked, and  gave us forks to eat creme brulee.  When we asked for spoons, she returned with large, round soup spoons.  The food was adequate, tho certainly nothing extraordinary.  Even the venue was so so with mismatched glassware, chairs and silverware."}
{"text":"This might be my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area.  It's a great date spot.  It's in an early 20th century house that they did a great job restoring.  The result is an intimate and very romantic setting.    The food is great.  I've been there  maybe four times and I've liked everything I have had there.  The Brie Brulee appetizer is a standout.    Keep in mind the place is small (maybe about 12 or 15 tables total) so reservations are a must.  Oh and it's a BYOB.  I think the corkage fee is about $8."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  I am a huge fan of the whole flip-the-house-and-turn-it-into-a-great-restaurant idea....Now I know this place has been around for a while, but this was my first time there and my wife and I were blown away. Being half French, my taste buds were excited upon first glance of the menu...but then I noticed hints of Morocco and other countries littered throughout the menu.   The brie brulee with caramelized apples was a true vision and the pate was wonderfully complimented by a tangy dijon mustard.  We opted for the lamb shank and pork tenderloin ( all farm animals baby! ) as our entrees.  These dishes blew us out of the water!   You must go as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"So enjoy food and service here! Owner is warm and welcoming. Chef cooks as requested. Lovely environment."}
{"text":"Service: HORRIBLE.  We had a reservation and they made us wait for 25 min. They did not have the courtesy of apologizing for making us wait. Trust me it was not a pleasure waiting with two kids. The owner was not at all friendly.  Food: Good.  But you will have to pay me to go back there. Never stepping in there again."}
{"text":"I love Coup des Tartes. It's the restaurant I choose for birthdays and anniversaries but it's not too expensive to go anytime. Best salads I've ever had. So fresh. It's a must to order one. I have also gotten salmon, chicken and pasta and all are great. The atmosphere is great and the staff is always friendly and provides excellent service. It's great for a romantic meal and I also took my family here when I came to visit. They also don't call it Coup des Tartes for nothing, I don't think anyone leaves without having dessert. I've had a s'mores tart and a pumpkin pie tart, both to die for. I look forward to seeing them overcome the obstacle of having to move into a new space. It looks awesome and I'm sure they will make it home in the new year. We will all follow wherever they go."}
{"text":"Went for restaurant week. Hostess in black dress (older lady) was not friendly at all and actually quite rude. Only savor was the wonderful waitress.  Filet was sub par"}
{"text":"We love this place everything is good on the menu. If you love french cuisine then you will love Coup Des Tartes. This is not a chain restaurant it is proprietor owned and he visits the patrons like all quality establishments. We loved the braised rib pasta and the scallop dish. A wonderful appetizer is the crab cakes and dessert of berry torte. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"We eat out 2-3 times a week and travel extensively, eating out. We  were not impressed at all.  It was noisy, service was poor and the Lamb Shank had about two bites of meat in it.  Not worth a visit."}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant, bar none. The food is impossible to describe, it is so amazing. Each dish is artfully prepared by their excellent staff, and the result is heavenly.  We have been here many times and the food is always exceptional, along with the service. We can't say enough good things about this place, you'll simply have to experience it for yourself. Try the filet, or the lamb shank. And for goodness sake, don't skip the three onion tarte!"}
{"text":"First time back since they re-opened.   Service was great as always, but the food is still coming along.  Will send direct feedback to the owners.  VERY busy night, the kitchen was a bit overwhelmed.  The timing of our food was good but others after us had to wait longer.  Still working out some of the kinks I think.  They will get there.  Nice wine list, love to be able to still BYO.  Beautiful setting, the patio is lovely!  Bar is very nice as well.  Lots more capacity than the original location.  We were in the room that was carpeted, I actually love the original wood floors in other parts of the building.  Harder to be an intimate setting when tables so close together and conversations easily carry.   Pastry chef hit a home run!!  Highlight of the meal!"}
{"text":"Great food! The French onion is the best in town. I tried their special which was huevos rancheros and they were amazing. The chef knows what he's doing. Also their onion tart is to die for. A mix of sweet and savory flavors is what makes this place amazing."}
{"text":"I am so glad we came here. It was amazing food, service, and environment. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"We tried Coup Des Tartes last weekend with the Groupon they offered. We had heard it was a decent BYOB restaurant and figured it was worth a try.  I am so happy we did!!!   The appetizers or \"small plates\" were the best part of the meal. We ordered the salmon pate special, the onion tart, and the brie. The salmon pate was amazing! I was worried when I ordered it thinking there were so many ways it could come out badly, but it was incredible. The consistency was perfect and it came with a nice assortment of vegetables and crackers. Even better than the salmon, was the brie. OMG, just perfect. I thought it wouldn't be any better than what I could buy in the cheese section of Trader Joe's, but BOY was I wrong. It was cooked perfectly covered in baked apples and just so tasty.  The worst appetizer of the three, but still really nice was the onion tart. The only reason I didn't care as much for it because it was on the sweeter side. For our entree we split a filet. The filet was really nice, but not anything that stood apart from anywhere else.   I would recommend coming to Coup Des Tartes for the adorable atmosphere, wonderful small plates, and to bring your own bottle! If you go for this, you cannot go wrong!!!"}
{"text":"If memory serves me correctly, this might have been the best lunch I've ever had. (maybe the most $$$ as well, goes hand-in-hand).   Melted Brie with grilled apples, pears, strawberries? YUM !   3 onion Tarte? Very sweet, BUT the Sav Blanc cut through the sweetness with it's grassy edge & complimented it perfectly (you have to bring your own, if you don't already know).   The spicy Asparagus soup? SLURP! (again, i never thought I'd say this, but the wine went perfectly & cut through the heat quite nicely).   Filet Mignon on cibatta was interesting: diced, served with avocado, but the downer was that it suppose to be served with pomme frittes, but it came with like frito lay ripple chips - kinda really ruined the presentation - big time.   Italian coffee - o ya.   Chocolate Mint Grenache nauche Torte ? Heaven, I'm in heaven...   The half point demerit, or star - Wait a minute - u cant do that here !!! if i could, I would - the incessant pounding and banging in the kitchen !! They were tenderizing meat almost the entire time here - Grrrr - it's a very tiny place, so yes, we could definitely hear it. alot.   That said, it was a great afternoon. Very special.  But certainly not in the pocket book to frequent again in the very near future.  Next business dinner I would love to suggest the private dinning room & lounge for sure !"}
{"text":"Really really not good.  Service may have been the worst I have ever encountered in AZ and if I had known about the parking lot, I would have brought my SUV and not the sedan.  We waited at the bar for the rest of our party with a bartender who was clearly unhappy something.  There was oddly no music in the restaurant but we were able to watch UFC fighting on the TV which is a favorite of my wife's on Saturday night date night.  After sitting at the table for fifteen minutes we were offered a drink and the bottle of red wine I ordered was warm and the wrong vintage.  They were nice enough to offer to bring an ice bucket for it.  An hour after we sat down, we still had our menus in hand waiting to order.  They brought the cheese plate but didn't bother to tell us what the cheeses were.  The salads were totally forgettable and badly composed and in my lobster risotto, the risotto and lobster were both undercooked.  Also, please hire a busboy.  I hate when I have to pick up my plates and hold them when the next course is brought unless I am serving myself in my own kitchen.... I am sure I am forgetting some things here but it's more that I don't feel like telling some who isn't going to listen, how to run a restaurant."}
{"text":"I had never been to CDT before but I didn't think it looked that fancy from the outside.  It also wasn't fancy on the inside, but I felt underdressed compared to the other patrons and I showed up by myself with a book...which also made me feel a little out of place once inside.  However, the staff was very friendly and the food is excellent.  Yes, the place is small and on a busy night, I would think it could get cramped.  Yes, as another reviewer pointed out, I was able to hear all the conversations around me.  Since I wasn't trying to talk to anyone myself, I didn't find this annoying.  However I did find it strange/disappointing that the restaurant is BYOB.  Unfortunately, I came empty handed.  Now, to the important thing:  the food.  FABULOUS!  And expensive.  I had the onion tarte as an appetizer.  It came with a small salad on the side.  The tarte was excellent...it reminded me of a very fine quiche.  On the waitresses recommendation I ordered the cod as an entrée.  It is not the cod that is visible on the online menu.  I think it might have been the best fish I've ever had in a restaurant.  It was cooked perfectly and the asparagus/vegetable medley (or whatever it was) that it was served over was to die for.  I completed my meal with a fruit tarte and cup of tea.  Again, the torte was exquisite.  Their food really is amazing.  But with the tip, my meal came to $76.  A little pricey.  My boyfriend was shocked when I told him how much my meal cost.  But the food is truly amazing and I will definitely be going back...and taking him.  But probably only for a special occasion and only when I have a bottle or two of wine in hand.  If you don't mind spending money on a beautiful meal, you should definitely try this place."}
{"text":"We love this place! It's the perfect restaurant for date nights, special occasions or a place to get amazing food. Their risotto is as good as what we have had in Italy. We haven't had a mediocre meal here yet. Everything is above and beyond. Don't expect to come here and get in and out quick. This restaurant was meant to be enjoyed slowly. They time the different courses perfectly. You can get wine, beer and cocktails there or join their wine club, pay a corkage fee and bring your own wine. Derrick was our waiter tonight and was amazing. So attentive and always making sure we were ok. But we have had a few different servers over the years and they have all been great. this place is literally a hidden gem. Make a reservation and request the patio if it's nice outside."}
{"text":"First time to the new location for our anniversary.  Great food and ambiance.  Bartender was nice enough to play some Edith Piaf on his phone since they were having some issues with their house speakers--made it even more awesome!"}
{"text":"Fabulous outdoor patio dining experience, and the food wasn't too shabby either. Really love the tarte desserts!"}
{"text":"We had high expectations and were not disappointed. We brought our own wine, made reservations and everything went smoothly. We were greeted at the door by the owner who introduced himself and seemed very pleasant which was refreshing. We were seated promptly and the server was right there to start us off. We selected the onion tart appetizer. It was good....really good.....we devoured it.  Our main course was lamb for her and filet for me. The lamb literally fell off the bone. It was served with a medley of other treats including figs which were very tasty. My filet was cooked just right and served with a generous side of asparagus and some of the best risotto I have had in a very long time. There was this blend of cheese and sweet Moroccan spices in the risotto that was to die for....I think I might have actually blacked out for a moment while eating it. Hell, I am getting light-headed remembering the flavors as I write this review. We finished by sharing the four berry tart for dessert which was good. It wasn't too sweet and it let berries do most of the talkin'.  Our server was a lovely gal who was pregnant. I only mention this fact because I can't remember her name but she was terrific and did a great job. The dining area is small and intimate but we knew this before we went so it was not a problem at all. In fact looking back I rather enjoyed our small corner table next to the widow. I don't dole out 5 stars very often but this place really got it right."}
{"text":"I love this place and the people who run it.  There is no other place in Phoenix  you will want to go IF you want to feel special.  Lamb is amazing and I have yet to be served anything I didn't love.  Don't forget to BYOW   Bring your own Wine.   Love it!"}
{"text":"The basics: nice atmosphere and good food, but a bit overpriced. Started out with the interesting cheese platter turns out that it is not $18 interesting. We then split a Roquefort salad. Quite tasty. We split two entrees - filet mignon and lamb shank. Filet was cooked well and sides were very good. Lamb shank was cooked well, but the sauce sucked. Dessert consisted of two tarts - Samoa and Four Berry. Four Berry was really good. Samoa was okay, but not great.  All in all the bill was close to $150 without a drop of liquor.   For that kind of money we/you could have two meals elsewhere."}
{"text":"My wife has been searching for a good French inspired restaurant and saw Coup Des Tartes on a Groupon deal.  We decided to go for brunch on the 4th of July weekend.  It is on the other side of town from us but it was well worth the drive.  The setting was nice, and the restaurant itself has a very unique  layout.  The service was very friendly, helpful and efficient but not intrusive.  The food was fabulous!  I am a big fan of French Onion soup and this was as good as any I have ever had.  The layers of flavors were amazing.  My wife had the escargot and savory crepes and said they were delicious as well.  The entire experience was fantastic and we are going back for dinner soon... can't wait."}
{"text":"So I was taking a licensing class for my profession on Camelback and 16th Street....an area I have visited only a few times in the 25 years I've lived in Arizona (I am a blessed native Phoenician).  I kept trying to find a place to eat nearby that would be tasty, healthy, and where I could dine in an hour without eating horrid fast food. I happened upon Coup Des Tartes, and thought I'd give it a shot.  I was elated! The atmosphere is charming and quaint, sending me back to the time of villas and simple yet delicious food. My Chicken Pesto Sandwich was absolutely to die for - the pesto is every bit as good as my Sicilian grandma's - a review that was received with excitement by the incredibly cheerful and warm staff!  It was SO good in fact, that I went back the very next day and this time invited my foodie boyfriend - who had the sandwich I tried the day before - and was COMPLETELY wowed. My Brie and Ham sandwich was DELICIOUS.   This is now my FAVORITE lunch place - if only I worked closer to Coup Des Tarte - I would be their most frequent patron."}
{"text":"My husband brought me here last Friday night for our anniversary. Ever since I graduated from Le Cordon Bleu in 2007, authentic French food has always been my favorite cuisine. I have been to a lot of restaurants, and have worked in quite a few fine dining restaurants as well, 3 of which were French/Creole-Cajun. I have to say I was impressed with this restaurant! We sat outside that evening- the hanging lights added a romantic touch. We ordered the crab cakes and Escargot for appetizers and the escargot was delicious! It did have a sauce that wasn't a true butter sauce, but either way, I liked it! My husband had the Seafood stuffed Pork Chop and I thought he was going to lick the plate clean. I had the Filet Mignon (medium rare) that was like heaven in my mouth. I was always taught by my chefs that any filet cooked more than medium is a waste of meat- so I've always ordered rare/medium rare, and I'm glad they actually know how to properly cook their meat! Most restaurants will turn a perfectly good steak into tire rubber aka well done. My asparagus and potatoes were tasty as well. Even though we were stuffed, we decided to order their Creme Brûlée. My final reason for giving them the 5 stars is because they made it right! It had Vanilla Bean which is key for Creme Brûlée- I hate going to restaurants and it either not being cooked properly, the sugar not being burnt right, or worse, adding some kind of flavoring to it. Their Creme Brûlée was perfect!   We will definitely be back. My only suggestion would be to play French music...again, we sat outside so maybe they play it inside? Makes me miss working in a French restaurant..."}
{"text":"Always enjoyable, great ambience... and the folks are kind, even when I brought el cheapo wines when I first started eating here...  We come a few times a year for the past 4 years... if the menu rotated more often w/ variety (not just changing from fish dish A to fish dish B), we'd certainly increase the visits.  Especially love the interesting cheeses plate (more or less the same combo as far as I can tell these past few yrs) and the pate!"}
{"text":"Where to begin...I think I will start with the positive.   The brie brulee topped with the caramelized apple slices was a hit, the mixed green salad with goat cheese was awesome and the pear tart desert was outstanding.  The lamb shank was cooked perfectly, but the lamb flavor was missing.   The whole dish ( lamb shank, veggies, Israeli couscous, figs and apricots) ALL had the exact same flavor; only the textures were different.   Now the flavor was great, but not something I would write home about.   Now to the negative stuff...The place was too crowded and noisy for my liking. The tables were so close that I felt I could join in the conversation next to me without effort. Couple that with REALLY REALLY slow service and, well you get the idea.   You will need to bring your own wine and they will open it for you for only $10.00.  French food without wine?   really??  And then you gaff me for 10 bucks?!?  Needless to say I had the minted tea. It was okay but no real mint flavor to speak of.   The final bill for one appetizer, one salad, one entree and one desert was $70.00. (Not counting the tip)  My date and I split everything and we were comfortably well fed. So, the portion size was decent.   To sum up, it would be a nice place for a date, but I won't be back and I know a place not to far from there that I would MUCH rather go to given the choice."}
{"text":"As  new transplant to Phoenix, I was so happy to find this place on groupon!  After the stress of flying from NYC 8 months pregnant and with our cat, having dinner here was like a dream.  Everything was delicious, portions were filling and it was just so relaxing.  We had the duck special and the salmon, along with snails and the goat cheese toast triangles- everything was made just right.   We had a great time!  Also, everyone was very nice.  This place would fit right in in Brooklyn or Paris!  Glad it is in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"very disappointed the food wasn't  very good at least the lamb the menu was very boring not much to choose from and over priced for lunch the service was good won't be back anytime soon but give it a try maybe dinner would be better"}
{"text":"Cannot say enough good things about this restaurant.  I typically order the Filet (which is excellent)when I am here, however this time I thought I would be more adventurous and try the house special grass fed Australian lamb.  The dish was very flavorful, the vegetables excellent and the meat simply fell off the bone.  The atmosphere and the food put this place up as one of the best in Phoenix."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a wonderful meal here last night.  The food and service was amazing!!!  I truly think this is one of the best restaurants in Phoenix.  Looking forward to going back next week.  Thank you Coup Des Tartes for the wonderful experience.  See you soon!"}
{"text":"We found everything to be wonderful!  The brie platter for the appetizer was tasty and gone in short order.  One of us ordered the fillet and the other the pork loin.  Cooked perfectly and enough that we each took half home.  The special tartes was pumpkin...there was none of that left over!  It was a great idea to use our groupon on Halloween night...only a few tables through the entire meal.  Server was attentive and chatted with us when we asked about their upcoming move in 2014."}
{"text":"We would consider coup des tartes one of the best restaurants we have been to in phoenix.    The ambiance is charming, the service is unobtrusive, a wonderful place for date.  We have been three times and never left disappointed.  Anything with a tart will be amazing (both sweet and savory).  The lobster parpadelle was fantastic and brie brulee is a delicious meal in itself.  The other entrees we have had were defitely above average.  We love the byob aspect, but in reference to a recent post, I belive the corkage is not $18 but $9.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Our children arranged for us to have dinner here for our anniversary. What a wonderful romantic dinner. The food was amazing not sure which was better the filet or the lamb but we're delicious, the French onion soup is out of this world!  We tried escargot  for the first and it was really good, the chocolate souffle,  creme Brule were fantastic  what a great way to finish up the meal.  The service was great, the owner was there talking with everyone and making sure everything,  everyone  was having a great experience.  We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Coup des Tartes is clean fresh French food. The summer menu was perfect. I enjoyed the Chevre Tomata appetizer and the pasta. My husband enjoyed the soup de jour and the peppered filet. I was shocked he even enjoyed the capers. The \"hash brown potatoes\" and spinach were a perfect accompaniment. Our bill was $84 without tip including corkage. I love that the restaurant is BYOB with amazing food. I decided it must be moved into my regular rotation even if it is a bit of a drive for us. They also run Groupon specials."}
{"text":"Ok, so this was really incredibly depressing.  We had heard such wonderful things about this place, and even really enjoyed mother's day brunch here.  BUT, when we went here last night for our anniversary dinner, it was incredibly lackluster.  the brie brulee was ok.  my husband's filet was very underwhelming (though the risotto was delicious), my pork was good, and the four berry tart was yummy.  The problem was that we could have spent that money somewhere else on an even better meal.  Having moved recently from San Francisco, we try to stop ourselves from over criticizing, but we've found some real gems in Phoenix.  Coup des Tartes is not one of them. :("}
{"text":"Enjoyed a wonderful evening at the \"new\" romantic and lovely location of CDT. They opened at the 17th and Osborn location in 2014 but I had moved away before I was able to visit. Now that I'm back, it was such a intimate location and yet, not over crowded. The inside has lovely nooks and crannies for a nice quiet dinner or a fun dinner party. The outside patio is a great size with cute little lights and a small stage for music to create a wonderful mood.  Food is top notch and I will definitely be back to try the desserts. My favorite was the onion tarte but I appreciated the quail turnover. I can't wait to see if they have a good french classic like boeuf bourgenoiun. I like how they have a bar which seems well stocked and frequented. A little pricey but nice for a treat. The only downside is the parking can get crowded if there are several groups gathered at the same time."}
{"text":"To start, this is not French Food, It is American food. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff. I would give the food a B to B- rating."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! Chilean sea bass as well as both of the tarts were wonderful. We brought our two and six year old along and they were extremely accommodating. Great dishes with the exception of one of the salads which was a bit over salted. The place itself is very quaint and the host was warm and understanding of our children and their needs for crayons and such. Would love to return."}
{"text":"I thought the atmosphere was great, the food was very good and I actually liked the BYOB.  My boyfriend and I went to celebrate a special occasion and we were able to bring a special bottle of wine we had been saving for such an event.  I agree that the food is a little pricey but I think it was very good.  I am not sure what Nita is talking about when she says its like deli food, I didn't get that impression at all.  I will definitely be back for another fun occasion or celebration when I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I host an ethic lunch group that meets every Thursday and today, we went to lunch at Coup Des Tartes. Our lunch was planned for 1:00 pm and when I arrived at 12:50, I waited in the front host area for about 5 minutes before I started walking around looking for where my group was. I ended up running into one of the servers who had her hands full but cheerfully greeted me and led me to my group which was already seated in the dining room.   My group is full of foodies and admittedly, we are very particular about... well, just about everything! The two servers that tended to us were extremely helpful and patient (even when we sent them running back to the kitchen to find out where the salmon and crab was from) and very knowledgeable about their menu, making suggestions to my group when asked. Our waters were continually filled (as was my coffee) and every single person at the table RAVED about their food. I had the french onion soup which was good but the croutons could have been slightly crispier before they added the cheese and browned it in the oven. We arrived at 1, ordered around 1:25 and finished our meals between 2:30-3pm. Some in our group opted for dessert and were again very happy with the quality of the dessert (I believe both diners had the brown butter pear tarts). Overall, I would highly suggest this restaurant and I plan on coming back in the fall when I can enjoy the gorgeous patio dining area outside!"}
{"text":"I had Sunday Brunch here a couple of weeks ago and was anticipating a great meal. The first thing that struck me was that our group of 5 were the only people in the restaurant at noon on a Sunday. We were the only ones there when we arrived and the only ones there when we left. Surprising. The person serving us seemed to be pulling double duty. While I can't be sure of this, his frequent and lengthy absences had me suspicious that he was, in fact, cooking our meals.   That being said, the food was excellent. Eggs Benedict is the bellwether of all brunch meals for me, so that's what I ordered. The latte that I ordered was exceptional. At $5 a pop, I easily could have run up a $30+ bar tab on these alone. To keep costs under control, I made the switch to regular coffee, which was also excellent.   All in all, a great meal. My only disappointments were the lack of crowds and spotty service. Hopefully, some of you will read this and put Coup Des Tartes on your Sunday brunch rotation!"}
{"text":"C'est magnifique! Pastries, cafe, entrées; all created with love, quality & flair. The atmosphere is beautiful, cozy & uncrushed...You are treated like royalty no matter how much or little you happen to order. Come often and whenever for a refreshing experience few others have tried to match. Manika & Jean Louis, my new 4-legged love rescue Bichon Frise"}
{"text":"Friendly yet sophisticated. Ron, the owner, takes great pride in every detail from the beautiful property to the seasonal menu to the guest experience. He personally gave us a tour of the historic building and add-on. Derek, our faithful bartender, is affable, attentive, and amazingly accommodating, even during busy happy hours or restaurant week. The food will not disappoint: it's interesting, but not pretentious. Serving sizes are happy medium between tiny-French and colossal-American. The bar-manager is very knowledgeable and eager to share her joy of wine. I've been there several times with different friends and none of us has ever been disappointed!"}
{"text":"We came in with a reservation for my husband's birthday on a Sunday for brunch. The staff were friendly and welcoming. We loved the general ambiance of the place, it's like you're walking into a home and I would assume this was a house converted into a restaurant. The dining areas are separated into rooms which gives privacy to the diners. Their brunch menu is fairly new so we didn't get a significant response from our hostess in terms of item popularity. We went for the onion tarte, we loved every bite and would say this was the highlight of the meal. The crust was buttery and the filling was flavorful.  My husband got the Filet benedict, eggs were perfectly poached and the hollandaise sauce had the right amount of creaminess to compliment the filet and flakes of blue crab. The potatoes were also well seasoned and I caught myself picking from my husband's plate.  I got the Salmon Nicoise salad, again, well executed. The salmon was cooked right and the potatoes were oven roasted which added that needed crispy texture to the salad. Unfortunately, we didn't have room for dessert. My only comment would be, the service was somewhat slow but we weren't sure if that's really the pace they offer since it's a French restaurant.  We will surely keep this place in mind, likely to try dinner next time."}
{"text":"I am always a big fan of a place in Phoenix that is a BYOB. There aren't many around. I'm not a fan of the typical mark up on wines. Corkage is $10. I am not usually one for ordering soup, especially in 110 degree weather. I had the tortilla soup. I was very impressed. At $6 this is a real bargain. It was packed full of veggies and chicken, more like a stew than a soup. Our entrees last night were the Filet Mignon and the pork tenderloin. The Filet was cooked perfectly to order. The accompanying potatoes were tasty with a hint of citrus I believe. The pork was equally as good. The goat cheese on top was a nice addition. I have been here before and had less stellar meals. Surprisingly their specialty, the lamb shank, was not very impressive. It was not nearly as tender as it should have been. A shank should have the meat nearly falling off the bone. Ironically I have never had a dessert here so i can not comment on that."}
{"text":"Coup Des Tartes has been a family favorite for years!  The dinner we enjoyed tonight was nothing short of excellent!  Andrea was wonderful!  She had great energy and really went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and well attended to.  My family hadn't been to the new location, and she offered to take us on a tour and gave us the history of the building - which was a treat!    Every course was perfection!  From the shrimp filled calamari, filet with truffle macaroni and cheese, and creme brûlée to top it off!  The courses were also well spaced out and arrived just in time.  We can't wait to come back!  Thanks so much for another memorable experience!"}
{"text":"As good as it gets is right. I did not expect to find such a wonderful little place in PHX. This is a place you'd expect to find in SF... Great food, wonderful staff and a charming atmosphere. I highly recommend it for lunch or dinner.  Our party went there for lunch and we had a combination of salads and sandwhiches but I made sure to see what else came out of the kitchen. Out food was very good, well seasoned, perfectly cooked and the \"observed\" food looked great, too. As European, I have to say, tres bon! I'd go back every chance I get."}
{"text":"This place is so romantic! I went here twice. Once on a spur of the moment type deal with me and my boyfriend, then again on Valentine's Day (prices go way up on Valentine's Day, but food stays the same quality) It is good! I love french cuisine so this place was up my alley.  It's not a place you eat at everyday but when you do you understand why it's such a treat. It is BYOW we found out when we got there the first time, a nice couple offered to give us their's as they brought two but my BF when down the street and got the kind we like. I'm a Moscato girl when I do drink wine. It's good that if you forget you can always run down to that big liquor store and get some. :)   I got the fish, my BF got the lamb (each time) appetizer was Brie and camelized fruit which was pretty much my favorite part. I don't really remember dessert but I know i had it and it was a sort of tart. All in all this place is good... the environment is what gives it everything though. Very cozy and romantic, I don't think it's a good place for kids... but I have none so I really don't know."}
{"text":"This 1930's home was transformed into a lovely venue for an upscale dining experience. Great wine list, decedent French food, and five-star service...what's not to like? Crab cakes served with fresh greens was tasty, though I ended with an uncomfortable grinding on my teeth from a bit of random crab shell. The chicken cordon bleu was out of this world delish...heavy, buttery, French sauce that will make you break into song. The Girlscout Torte wasn't bad either."}
{"text":"One of 2 of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix!  The food and atmosphere are exquisite!  I have been searching for a great French restaurant ever since I relocated from Tucson a year ago.  This place is also nice, because while it offers traditional French food, it also offers other delicious gourmet dishes.  The menu is relatively small (as it should be), but diverse.  The French onion soup is excellent, as is the Roquefort salad, and the Lobster with risotto.  I have been to this restaurant 3 times in two weeks and cannot recommend it enough.  It's a great lunch spot for professionals and \"ladies who lunch\" as well as a wonderful romantic dinner spot."}
{"text":"Outstanding restaurant! I planned on going to their previous location when I moved to Phoenix some years ago. Unfortunately it closed before I did. Glad to say it has reopened in new location.  Had an superlative brunch today. Very friendly & helpful staff, private small rooms with a few tables actually made conversation with my guest possible, and mostly the best food I've ever had in this town! I used a Groupon discount so it was definitely a great deal as well as great place. Looking forward to returning soon. Definitely one of the best in Phoenix, if not THE BEST."}
{"text":"Note: Server Andrea, Owner Ron, two exception people!  My wife chose this as the dinning spot for her Birthday. What a great decision and TOTALLY worth the drive. Literally 35 miles away from our home. WE'LL be back.  The out side was beautiful, beautiful tables are set on what I would describe as a rustic patio. The inside is obviously an old home that has been tastefully converted into several (maybe seven) small dinning rooms.  Andrea spent a great deal of time making our experience very special. She hunted down a jacket for my daughter who was a bit cold. Her descriptive explanation of the specials were mouth watering and a perfectly matched the end result.   Every dish was prepared perfectly. I was not alone in ordring the special. Hot Sea Bass and peach with some cold pacific sea coast asparagus type vegetables and coconut cream. So unusual and so satisfiing. The flavors were unknown to me yet so wonderful on the palate.   Ron kept tabs on us from the very beginning and was there to follow up on every corse. He came around as we were leaving only to ask if we would like a tour of the entire place. We agreed and were lead through the different rooms as he explained the background of the restaurant and the building. He spoke with a sense of pride and I would too. This is a restaurant with so much going for it.  Bravo, thank you. We will see you again soon.  Jason E. Lee"}
{"text":"First off, I'm surprised this place doesn't have more reviews. Secondly, I have this rule that if I have a place bookmarked as \"To Review\" and I haven't been there for over one year, then I wait until I go there again to review it. I have since moved away from Phoenix, but found a very detailed post about a date I went on there over a year ago-- judging by some of the 5-star reviews on here from this year (Hey Gabi M.!) it seems like they've been pretty consistent since then...  SO...Coup Des Tartes is one of those perfect date places. The expensive, fancy kind with the perfect, cozy atmosphere, the cute China, and classy menu. It's where people spend birthdays and anniversaries-- sometimes you'll even see a proposal here. Well-to-do regulars and wide-eyed first timers are in culinary bliss here and ride wave after wave of soothing French delight with checkbooks and high caloric intake caught in the undertow. While my date ended up being a total dud, the meal I had here is one of the most memorable ones I have had in Phoenix.   Coup des Tartes has great savory tarts. The three onion tart was delicate with the perfectly gold crust melting in my mouth. It was buttery, but isn't all great French cuisine made with tons of butter?( Julia Child taught me that one. ) I loved that it had leeks in it's Gryuere egg custard. The soup of the day when I went was an asparagus-leek soup, which was creamy, but not too heavy. For my main course I had an amazing Chilean Sea Bass which was served with this amazing curried coconut milk crab salad. It was topped with pistachios, which I didn't care much for, and these sea beans which I usually like, but didn't like this time because of a slightly rubbery texture (I can't blame them much though since this WAS in Arizona during the summer). The lame guy I went on a date with (who had this awful hang-up about sharing bites) got the lamb shank, which he said was absolutely fantastic, but I didn't get to try it because he was probably afraid of cooties, which for the record, I do not have. ;)  For dessert, we went with the recommendations of the waiter, which was a chocolate-hazelnut tart and a seasonal mixed berry tart with poached pears. AMAZING. Did I mention that this place is BYOB with a tiny $10 corkage fee? Now THAT'S something that should seal the deal for you. Keep it classy though, Phoenix- don't bring cheap wine to eat with your fantastic meal. Luckily,said date knew a thing or two about wine and brought a spectacular 2002 Barolo.   Bad date, but amazing dinner. So amazing, I can write about it fondly until this day."}
{"text":"I went here with my family and was very impressed by both the service, the food, and the atmosphere. On the outside the restaurant doesn't look like much, but when you go in it is very cozy.  It is small, but they do have a room for bigger parties.  The restaurant is very romantic and also good for families.  They made sure my 3 year old nephew had his food out within minutes of our arrival, even though the entire party has not yet arrived.  The food was great and it was fun to just sit back, enjoy the company, and fill up. They don't rush you at all. I had the halibut and the fish itself was very well cooked, but I didn't like the coconut topping that came with it.  The brie plate was delicious.  The only downside is the price. The food is expensive, but if you don't mind - I think it is a great place for family meals or a romantic night out."}
{"text":"I love tarts and WOW, Coup Des Tartes has some amazing tarts! I felt like I took a 3 hour trip to one of my favorite restaurant/bakeries in Germany! This place is so quaint and adorable it is easy to pass it by because it looks like a little cottage off of 16th Street (well, because that is what it is).   We had the onion tart as an appetizer and it was quite tasty. The salad was just a salad. We ordered two entrees and shared because everything sounded really good on the menu. The Filet Mignon was perfectly cooked with mashed potatoes; it was nothing too exciting really as it was a typical filet. But, the halibut was amazing! It came with sea beans, which I had never had before! They are kind of like a cross between asparagus and green beans with a natural salty taste to them (they grow by the sea).  Atop all of that was a coconut oil sauce of some sort, which was VERY yummy!  The halibut was a delicious unique meal all around. We learned all about our food from our outstanding waitress, who did a superb job the whole evening. She also said their specialty is lamb, so I will be back to try that dish for sure.   My only complaint is the corking fee seems a bit steep, however all in all the meal is worth it! Also, if you forget your wine like I did (this place is BYOB), Total Wine is 2 blocks away :)   I had to save the best for last...dessert! Order any tart; I am sure it will make your taste buds happy!!"}
{"text":"Coup Des Tartes was really a 3.5 experience for me, but I'm going to round up.  My husband and I chose Coup Des Tartes for our anniversary dinner this year for a few reasons - 1. BYOB.  2. We love French food and always go to a French restaurant for our anniversary and 3. Its billed as being romantic.  Those seem like pretty reasonable requirements, right?   First of all, this is not French food.  Sure, there are French inspirations and they serve brie but the menu is largely American with all sorts of influences.  (My husband's entrée had cous cous!)  Second of all, I didn't find it romantic.  I guess if you use romantic to mean the same things an East Coaster means when they say \"intimate\" or \"cozy\"....which to everyone else means cramped.  I wouldn't have minded the close quarters had it not been so loud!  The loud ambiance and the bright lights killed most of the romantic atmosphere.   The food was solidly good.  There was no \"close my eyes and savor\" moment.  My husband enjoyed his lamb, even if it was definitely not a French preparation.  I ordered the lobster, as I've heard Australian lobster is the best of the Pacific lobsters.  It was good but I'll take a Maine lobster any day.  Naturally, we had a tarte for dessert. I have to say was the most dissapointing part.  I was expecting one large circular tarte and what was placed in front of me was a pie slice of a tarte.     I think that Coup Des Tartes would work best for a small group....I think 6 may be too big.  It does work for a date, just don't expect it to be too romantic.  The prices aren't outrageous so it would make a nice night out with a significant other or friends.  I think for a special occasion you can do better."}
{"text":"We love their new location. They successfully retained the charm of the previous location while increasing capacity. We were there for brunch and we're seated in a cozy, quiet room. The service was attentive without being intrusive, very friendly. Our server , Derrick, greeted us promptly and advised us of the daily additions to the menu. Everything we ordered ( French onion soup, eggs Benedict with lamb, salmon nicoise) arrived at the table perfectly prepared. We had plenty of time between service of our selections to savor the food and conversation. For dessert, we shared the cinnamon bun; it is not a \"sticky bun\" in the tradition of the Amish, but definitely a good cinnamon bun. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Gorgeous patio + fireplace + crème brûlée cheesecake = I will be back!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! This place is pretty far from my house but worth it. Went here for our 10 year anniversary. Food was perfectly cooked. Service was fantastic. Atmosphere was also really nice."}
{"text":"mmm I love this place.  I love how it's small but big because you know it's the talk of the town. I love that it's BYOB (not beer, but bottle because it's fancay *spoken with a british accent). I love their vegetarian option. I loved that the owner came by to check on us. I love that the floor creeks, and the wood is old and scuffed. This place is wonderful to go to for a date!  And if you don't have a date, go here anyway. There's a creepy guy in the back ally named Sven, you can take him with you,."}
{"text":"Alright, me and my husband come in once a month and most recently came in a few days ago and had the BEST lunch. We both ordered the Morrocan Lamb Sandwiches, his with pomme frites and mine with a salad. We then split a Mocha Pecan Tarte Which was WHOA amazing. Actually it was better than that but you'll just have to try it for yourself.  This is definitely a great place if you want to get away from horrible chain restaurants and experience a cute mom and pop establishment where the customer service is warm, friendly and attentive and remembers you every time you come in.   The food is fresh and unique. Others have complained about how small the place is-but that's the point people...to get away from the cookie cutter type restaurants. (It's a old bungalow that has been renovated into a restaurant.) Coup Des Tartes is a perfect place for a romantic meal or top notch desserts...which are so few and far between in Phoenix.  I didn't want to put a review up because I didn't want them to be slammed all the time. Us regulars keep treasures like Coup Des Tartes a secret so that we can marvel at our good eats without waiting in line for a table! Since I am moving out of town, I feel that someone should benefit from the good food and take up our regular spot. Cheers!  Oh BTW-the fact that they are also BYOB makes them even cooler. I also like the diversity I see at Coup Des Tartes. You'll spot anyone from hipster teens to lunch-break suits and all in the quest for delicious fresh food."}
{"text":"Here for New Year's Eve, fantastic menu with the ambiance to match. Food was excellent and the service was second to none. I highly recommend this fine establishment for your dining pleasure."}
{"text":"I am usually quite stingy with my five star rankings, but this place deserves one of them!  My husband and I came here to celebrate our 6 month anniversary and were impressed.  I ordered the lobster with risotto, but wanting something heartier, my husband leaned toward the lamb shank.  However, he's not a fan of couscous and although the menu says that substitutions are kindly refused, we asked our waitress and she didn't hesitate to give us other options.  So don't be discouraged, it pays to ask!  We had mashed potatoes instead, and it was fantastic.  The lamb shank was hearty, fork melting goodness with a great red wine sauce.  The lobster was perfectly cooked so that it didn't get close to rubbery, but didn't make you feel like you were eating sushi.  The risotto was creamy and a perfect balance to the light lobster.  Lastly, we had a terrible time trying to decide which tarte to try, finally, having the four berry tarte with ice cream. If we hadn't been so full, we probably would have ordered more than one. The tarte came out piping hot, with melty ice cream on top.  The crust was perfect, not too sweet, and crumbly.    Make sure to make reservations and save room for more than one tarte!"}
{"text":"My bestie and I went for dinner on a Wednesday. Walking from the parking lot to the door you could smell deliciousness wafting in the air. I was ready to get my grub on! We sat on the patio. It was very cute! It would be perfect for a date.   We were served some bread and ordered the three onion tarte that everyone raves about. It was good, not crap my pants good that I was expecting, but very good. It was flavorful and the crust was delicate and tasty.  For dinner we both ordered the chicken. It was cooked perfectly and the mushroom sauce was excellent. The mashed potatoes and asparagus were well done also. We cleaned our plates and were stuffed so had to pass on dessert. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"After Yelp's amazing reviews, we decided to check this place out with a couple of friends. Initially, I was super excited from the outside with this cute little French restaurant. The service was nice and the owner even came by our table to greet us....THEN, the food came. The tomato and pepper soup was DRENCHED in salt. Our party had two members with high blood pressure so the soup was subsequently passed to me. Then, came the meal. The opah - which was the special of the night and recommended by the owner - smelled so so bad. It tasted just as bad. The duck, which was supposed to be their more recommended dish, was covered with fat. Ugh. They refunded our opah but gave us back our gift certificate, which we probably have to throw away now since none of us are bothering to come back."}
{"text":"Extremely poor service and attitude!  I had a reservation for a Saturday night using the Groupon offer that expires in a few days and is only good for Saturdays. They refused to accept it even though they accepted the reservation knowing I had a Groupon.  Their attitude was terrible!  I would never attempt to go there again."}
{"text":"I ate here with my mom, boyfriend and uncle. I love French food and was very excited to go here. The food was really good and was definitely home made. They didn't have escargot that night, which bummed me out. But everything else was very tasty."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Love the $11 unlimited mimosas for brunch. Tara was a great server. Can't wait to come back for dinner"}
{"text":"Coup Des Tartes is like a restaurant out of another city...certainly not what you run into so often in Phoenix.   Cozy. Quaint. Romantic.  The building itself is used so well.  When is the last time you were in a house more than 50 years old?     Now onto the food.  We started with a shared salad.  Tossed greens, mingled with raspberries, pecans, red onions and apples is FANTASTIC!  You must spear each morsel and savor each bite.  It is that good.  Even better is the warm grilled cheeselette on top.  For the main course I had gnocchi and my husband had lamb shank.  Both were incredible.  It was actually fun to eat them because the flavors were so subtle and unique.     Finally, onto the coup.  We selected a tarte with pumpkin and each bite was sooo good.  We already know what we will have next time.  The next visit is already in the works.  Was it pricey?  Yes and no. $78 for two before tip (we had great service).  This is certainly a bargain for a meal that we remember each bite!  Next time we will BYOB and maybe our corkscrew.  The wine drinkers around us struggled.  They were either inexperienced as openers or just needed a better corkscrew."}
{"text":"I needed a restaurant for a 3 year anniversary dinner.  I was referred to Coup des Tartes and was not disappointed. The atmosphere was exactly what I needed.  Something quiet, intimate  and romantic.  The food was exquisite and worth the drive from Prescott.  I grew up in  a French restaurant and my father is a classically trained French chef so I have had the luxury of being exposed to lots of different foods.  I also have been to France numerous times and it felt like I was there again.  The service was excellent, attentive but non intrusive.  We never felt rushed and had a wonderful evening.  Eating here is an experience to be enjoyed and savored, which is what fine dining is all about.  I found the experience to be a refreshing alternative to the fast food mentality.  I definitely will be back and plan to bring my father here as I am sure it will remind him of his childhood home in France."}
{"text":"Great restaurant but very average wine list.  For such  a great place the wine list is better suited to a chain restaurant.  As example La Jota 2011, a terrible vintage at $109 is ok but not the best.  Azelia Barolo 2012,  Barolo's are barely drinkable at 3 years, not a stellar pick."}
{"text":"My sister and I headed to Coup Des Tartes to use her Groupon before it expired. She had been before and loved it, so I was excited to finally see what all the fuss was about!   First of all, I just want to throw out there that I don't at all understand the name of the restaurant. From what I can recall from European History, a coup is a military overthrow. So... we're trying to overthrow the tarts?   Anyways, I'm glad that we got here early, because even on a Wednesday, the place filled up pretty quickly. We were able to be seated right away despite not having a reservation, but that could be because we arrived about 10 minutes after it opened for dinner. There are not many tables inside, so it'd be pretty difficult if you had a large group, but the whole place has a very cozy feel. Unfortunately, there are probably less than a dozen parking spaces out front, so I'm not sure where you would park once those filled up.  The food came out pretty quickly, and my sister had the lamb shank ($24) while I had the salmon ($28). Her lamb shank came out on a bed of cous cous with assorted vegetables on the side. It was tasty, but a little on the salty side. My salmon came with spinach and basmati rice, topped with a green olive salsa and pesto on the side. I don't usually like green olives, but it went well with the fish, though the salmon was cooked a bit more than I would prefer. The rest of the dish was well seasoned, but the salsa was a bit salty. Both dishes came in pretty big portions, and went great with their housemade mint iced tea.   Even though we were pretty full already, we figured that we couldn't leave without having some dessert! We had the chocolate peanut butter tart, which was great, but way too rich after our entrees. It was more chocolatey than peanut-butter-y, and not too sweet. We each only took a few bites, but luckily we got a box to take it home, and it was every bit as good the next day."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised when I tried Coup des Tartes. When you think of French food it conjures up images of pretentious food and snooty servers. It couldn't be farter from the truth at the Coup.  The dishes were authentically French, but approachable and somewhat familiar. The staff was super friendly and anything but snooty. We enjoyed a three onion tart and sautéed shrimp as a starter. The tart was savory with a sweet buttery crust. The shrimp skewers we hot tasty and melted in your mouth. We ordered the beef bourguignon and the stuffed pork chop for our mains. The beef was made with filet mignon cuts that were tender. The sauce was balanced but hearty. The stuffed pork chop was lolipopped and stuffed with spinach and other goodies. The seasoning on all the dishes was spot on. We really enjoyed the people and the food. It's a great value and a good spot for any occasion."}
{"text":"We had Sunday brunch there and it was excellent. Wonderful service, amazing food. I had the croque monsieur and it had me missing France! (Oh, and the Nutella crepe topped with berries is to die for!)"}
{"text":"Went for dinner to celebrate my parents anniversary and had the best experience. We all ordered different entrees and all of them were to die for. The summer menu is top notch. We had the scallop risotto, the short rib pappardelle and the salmon - we couldn't even pick a favorite because they were all equally amazing. Reasonably priced for the quality of food. Definitely a must in your restaurant rotation. Will definitely be back to try the rest of the summer menu!"}
{"text":"Came here with a reservation with moderately high expectations. The inside is charming and romantic and the food is great. Service was also good--not too much hovering and not too much neglect.   I ordered the lamb and it was tender with an amazing sauce. I ate every bite of it, kind of a rarity for me. The real treat was the tart. Two words: PUMPKIN TART. Amazing, amazing! It's a fall special and since I'm a pumpkin fanatic, it had to be tried.  Few downsides to an otherwise great place. The tables are so close to each other that you can hear the conversations of the table next to you. I could barely take off my jacket without elbowing the woman next to me! Also, the price. I felt the food was worth it but it does make the restaurant a place I couldn't come to very often."}
{"text":"my boyfriend took me here on my birhtday after several strong suggestions from his coworkers for a nice, romantic option.  and i was blown away! if you've been to house of tricks in tempe, expect the same crowd, decor/atmosphere and price, and the same food quality.  it was a beautiful historic house with an outside deck. it was very tiny, and it gets a little loud with the small settting and hardwood floors, but not enough to ruin a meal by any means. we had reservations on a saturday, and still had to wait for about 10 minutes. during taht time we saw several groups come in without reservations and get turned away.   the BYOB was a killer surprise. my BF printed the menu from their web site and took it to AJs and asked the wine guy for his suggestions, and that worked out perfectly.  i have to suggest the brie brule, brie covered with caramelized apples and served warm with toasts and seasonal fruits. absolutely wonderful and melt in your mouth.  we also had mozzerella and tomato salad, which was overkill on the cheese, but still good. i had the filet mignon and he had the pork tenderloin and they were also unbelievably good.  i'm sure it was a hefty bill, but def worth it for special occasions. i will def go back!"}
{"text":"Intimate, elegant, but pricey restaurant. Excellent service, great ambience and delicious food. This is the kind of restaurant you go to when you want to celebrate a special occasion and linger over a fabulous meal.  Don't go here expecting to rush through your food. Everything on the menu is very tempting so it was hard making a decision what to order.  Reservations are a must."}
{"text":"We ended up here one night as dessert refugees after a hugely disappointing meal at Vincent's on Camelback.  They were booked for the night but found us a table on the patio so we could enjoy at least one tasty morsel in our evening.  The tarts were fabulous, the owner who seated us was extremely accommodating and we were determined to come back.    Last night, we had dinner there.  It was a pleasant enough experience but I didn't it find it worth the cost (and we had a Groupon!).  I did not find the portions to be tiny as another reviewer said.  My filet was tasty enough but sadly, I had a better cooked filet earlier in the week at Charleston's for about $10 less.  My key lime tart was delicious but it was about 80% crust and 20% filling (I'm more of a filling girl than a crust girl).  My companions ordered the peanut butter mousse dessert and it was very tasty.  It would have been extra tasty with a wee bit more salt.    It's definitely a cute venue although I don't understand the distinctions about being a great \"date night\" place because it is quite small and privacy is limited.  It was a nice enough place but definitely didn't \"wow\" me."}
{"text":"Terrific food and you can hear each other talk"}
{"text":"Parfait! I enjoyed a perfect meal Thank you Karen W. for recommending the French Onion Soup at Coup Des Tartes and making time for a double Yelp luncheon. Chef prepared a perfectly balanced soup between wine and broth with tender onions. A crouton is baked over with Swiss Gruyere cheese ($10).   For the main meal, I had the Croque Monsieur, a toasted sandwich filled with Mornay sauce, ham, and baked over with Swiss Gruyere. OMG, to die for! The sandwich comes with a choice of Yukon potatoes or salad. The fresh greens lightly dressed in vinaigrette cut the richness of the sandwich beautifully. The portions are large. French cuisine that comes in American portions. Brilliant! My family enjoyed the half I took home.  I had the opportunity to taste the Salmon Nicoise. A generous portion of salmon came with blanched green beans, hard boiled eggs, tomato wedges and in a bed of greens. This came with the classic Nicoise vinaigrette. If you don't see it on the menu, ask for it.  This strategy afforded us the ability to enjoy dessert. We got a 4 berry tart a la mode, and a banana creme brulee. Sadly, I forgot to ask if the tart had nuts. It came with toasted almonds. My Karen generously let me have most of the Banana Creme Brulee with a chocolate crust drizzled with caramel and chocolate sauces.  Patty, our server was hospitable and knowledgeable about the menu. Ron, the owner of Coup des Tartes visited with us and presented the dessert options to us. The atmosphere was charming and a 5 Star experience all round."}
{"text":"This is a cute boutique restaurant! I was there for a bridal shower so I can't comment on the price, but the atmosphere was perfect for the fairytale event. Approximately 25 people fit very comfortably and there were stations with mimosas, iced tea and water, and an area for picture taking.   The food took awhile to be served once we ordered. I got a field green salad with almonds, strawberries and chicken. The vinaigrette was yummy, but there was too much on the actual salad. The chocolate mousse was delicious and a perfect ending to this meal."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had the pleasure of experiencing Coup des Tartes for the first time this past Friday for Restaurant Week. We initially sat inside but we realized we couldn't waste the opportunity to dine outside on the spacious patio on the first bearable night in months! Everything about our visit was perfect from our waitress, to the wine selection, and finally to our meal. Mr. Pacioni (the owner) even stopped by just to make sure everything was going well--truly a gentleman!  Everything we ordered was a delight, but Coup des Tartes is a master of desserts. My crème brulee cheesecake was absolutely decadent! I plan to return this week with my mom so that she can experience Coup des Tartes, as well!"}
{"text":"This is a favorite spot for my family for holidays, special occasions or just when we want to treat ourselves. Tonight we had the mango curry risotto with shrimp, salmon and chicken cordon bleu. All were exquisite. High quality ingredients and excellent taste. My dad also recommends the lamb. The desserts are always good and they rotate through options. Every one we have tried has been outstanding."}
{"text":"We went during Restaurant Week & the food was great. The ambiance is wonderful, too. The building seemed to be historic just from the little details like smaller walkways, small bathroom, etc. Decorated nicely & good \"romantic\" vibe. Again- the food, great. I had the filet & the flavor was outrageous. (I'm not even a huge red meat fan). Worth the trip. Not cheap. :)"}
{"text":"I know this place has been around for a long time so when I stumbled on a Groupon we thought we'd give it a try.  We live in the Uptown area and have amazing bars/restaurants around so thought we'd be safe doing a brunch here.  We sat for 10 minutes before anyone asked if we wanted water or a drink and they didn't seem to be overly busy so it was puzzling to say the least.  We ordered the french onion soup which was just OK and for our meals we ordered the lobster salad croissant and the steak and eggs.  It took a long time to get our food, hubby liked his meal but when I took a bite of mine (lobster) it didn't taste right and I sent it back.  Overall the service wasn't great and 1 out of 2 meals was just OK therefore it's just not enough for me to return."}
{"text":"My problem with Coup Des Tartes really is that the food is horribly overpriced...not moderately overpriced makes you feel like you're eating at a fancy place, but outrageously overpriced for the quality of the food. For their price points, the food should be a lot better and the tables shouldn't be so close to each other. Their food reminded me of the kind of food I can get from the Whole Foods deli. After Valentine's Day here, I felt taken advantage of by the restaurant. $100 PER PERSON for a measly set of 4 courses with the awful offering of cliched mushroom risotto as the sole vegetarian option, with no choice of anything else. Had the menu been priced at around $40 a person, I still think this place would still only be a 3 star quality but at least reasonably priced.   - Brie Brulee: A name far more interesting than the dish itself. It's a warm slice of brie served with stale/boring crusty bread and fruit. There was the tiniest bit of fruit compote served with it, so at least someone in the kitchen did something that required effort with this otherwise simple dish.  - Onion Tarte: Probably the tastiest thing all night, but again, not worth the money. It has a very strong caramelized onion taste with a nice flaky crust. - Salad: Greens, fruit, nuts, and too much dressing. It was fine but not worth $25. - Chestnut Soup: Didn't taste a thing like chestnuts. The taste is actually like an Indian lentil soup called Sambar.  - Filet Mignon: My boyfriend seemed to like it. The mashed potatoes it was served with were very good. The other accompaniment were sugar snap peas drowning in butter/oil. - Lamb Shank: The couscous & veggies served with the lamb were very boring tasting, like no one even took the time to season them. - Cherry Tart: This was yummy, and fortunately didn't taste much like cherry. The shortbread crust was good and the combination of warm pie with cold ice cream is classic. - Chocolate Ganache Tart: Pretty good. It, of course, tasted like chocolate. Nothing really remarkable.  I'm confused why everyone calls this place charming. It is not charming to be a foot away from the tables next to you. It is not charming to hear their conversation like you're having it with them, struggle to push out your chair to get up because there is another chair right behind you, and struggle to squeeze yourself between tables to leave. I cannot recommend Coup Des Tartes to anyone. The restaurant left a very bad taste in my mouth, figuratively. With so many other nice, moderately overpriced restaurants with much better food, I don't know why anyone would come here."}
{"text":"I took a date here for Valentines day and I must say that the food is GREAT! it has a really great feel to it. I  just wish I would have taken someone that did not piss and moan so much. lol. at least the food was good."}
{"text":"I attended AZ Restaurant Week at Coup Des Tartes with some girlfriends and we are STILL raving about it the next day. From the appetizers to the entrees to the buttery, rich desserts; everything was perfect. The price is $44 for 3 courses and it is seriously worth every penny.   I started with the Frisee and Grape Salad. The blue cheese was so mild and it was incredible.   For me entree {Beware: you will have a difficult time choosing!} I ordered the Filet Mignon with a taragon mushroom cream sauce, the creamiest mashed potatoes that I have ever had in my life, and sauteed asparagus. Holy heaven, this was one of the best meals that I have had in a LONG time!   My friends and I each ordered a different dessert so that we could try all of them! The creme brulee was SO CREAMY and literally perfection, chocolate flourless cake was decadent, and brown butter pear tart had the most perfect buttery crust. We couldn't even choose a favorite because they were all phenomenal.   Restaurant week or not, this place is a must try. They have an ADORABLE patio, along with a private room for special parties and functions. They also have Happy Hour! I will most definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Just left here not fifteen minutes ago.  One table of ladies with one rude woman sat next to us. Not the restaurants fault, yet irritating that such people exist.  Lemonade to drink, just fine as is.  Brie Brulee 12  Quite uninspired in presentation and the brie was very ordinary, my friends Mer and Mike serve one of much higher quality.  French Dip Sandwich 12  This one was with salad. Another lackluster presentation, but that would have been ok if were good. It was not, or at least to me.  The beef was cut too thick and with it being too well done and the gristle made for a tough sandwich with little redeeming flavour. It was left half eaten  Chicken Cordon Blue 10  I did not eat this, but Brice told me it was ok if all you were expecting is a chicken and ham sandwich. He did finish.  We had mentioned we wanted to talk with someone about renting the extra room, or get a card. The wait person said ok after we are done she will send someone out. We did sit a while after we were done; no one came out or was a card offered. But it might have been because I guess I caught her off guard earlier.   In the middle of eating our sandwiches she asked if everything tasted good. I said no, she looked at me as if she did not understand, so I repeated that I did not like my food. Talk about someone's face changing from a smile to a deer caught in the headlights, she stammered and said sorry then ran off. NO question of why I felt displeasure or any thought of remedy. It did give us a chuckle with such lack of attention. But what it also did was make us reconsider if we should even think about the room for a party.  So once again I am in the minority since no rave from me.  Oh yeah and we had to ask for forks. Hahhahhahhah oh well......."}
{"text":"Party of 10. So we were in the back room. Huge. Weird. Echoes. No ambiance. Cold!  Saturday night. 7pm reservations. Patio looked busy hard to say if the restaurant was really slammed or not.  Food was good. But ...First thing they said. \"No French onion  soup. We ordered 8 bottles of wine altogether. Nice wine selection.  Bruschetta, snails, crab cakes, steak tartare. All good and good bread.  We weren't offered salads. Waiter was very nice but service was SLOOOWW.  Then \" No duck\". My boyfriend ordered the Lamb shank. The waiter had to return to say \" no lamb\". Gave  us a gift certificate for $25 and he was very apologetic.  Coffee was good coffee. Nothing special. Served in the cup not poured table side. So the saucers were full of coffee.  We brought a birthday cake so I can't speak to the desserts."}
{"text":"It is restaurant week and we finally went and had a good experience.  First- I like that it is BYOB, we got to bring a great bottle of french wine and not pay the mark up but simply a $10 corkage (however, next time I will bring my own glasses, not a fan of thick glass wine glasses). For appetizers we had the tomato goat cheese tart and mussels. They were both very tasty. For the main course we had the lamb shank and the chilean sea bass. The lamb shank was fall of the bone tender and wonderfully flavorful - the sea bass on sea bean salad was really really good- very well composed and balanced. The desserts were very good too - Hadden liked the peanut butter chocolate the best and I like the Brown Butter Peach.  Good food, nice intimate but casual setting. This is a definite Phoenix must-try and a great date spot."}
{"text":"To be fair I've only eaten there once - tonight - and all I had was a salad and brought my own wine.  Still, my tab:  $27.   Ouch!    I can appreciate a corkage fee, but I'm scratching my head in a way... it wasn't a $100 bottle... more like $10.  The staff didn't open it, touch it,  decanter it, chill it, pour it.  They might have not even seen it, but for my asking.  As for the salad, it was good, but nothing one can't make at home for a few dollars.  Greens, apple slices, a few figs and some bits of Rock cheese (or sub any blues).       Combined with the corkage, I thought it was overpriced and easily replicated for a portion of the cost.  Likewise, my friend had the Brie cheese appetizer, which was pretty much a big chunk of Brie served with bread and fruit.   It looked great, tasted great, but honestly is something one can put together after a shopping trip to TJs.    It's a charming place, nice staff and I can see how it's popular.  And as mentioned, I've only gone once so maybe the entrees will prove to be outstanding."}
{"text":"In short: What a gem of a restaurant, fresh and delicious and the tarts are a must try.  I've been here a few times since I discovered it in Yelp eats week.  The food is amazing, everything is properly prepared with flavor, texture, and presentation in mind.  I've never walked out of here unhappy.  It's a very cozy place at times feels a bit crowded but everything inside is in good taste.  Staff is very polite and helpful.  It's a BYOB so make sure to grab a few bottles of wines if you are planning on heading there.  A small corkage fee applies per bottle but not a big deal for me.   As the name indicates the tarts are the star here, I recommend starting off with the onion/gruyer tart and then saving some room for one of those deserts tarts at the end.  They are amazing, and once in a while they have special seasonal creations.  My favorite here's probably the lamb shank or the seared duck breast but you can't go wrong with anything you order.  Keep en eye on their website, periodically there are really good deals."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here excited to try this place. We loved every thing. The food was great, the place was very romantic and beautiful, very pretty. We came here at about 7:30. They had live music which was also very good. The staff was very welcoming, sweet and friendly. We loved the steak tartare very well presented with the quail egg on top, we also got the escargo which was delicious. Our main dishes were veal (my husband) and lamb shank (mine) which was also beautifully presented and delicious. Loved the desserts! They also have very good coffee. The meal was a very good and satisfying one. Very memorable we are definitely coming back. Loved the staff. I noticed some of the bad reviews on here were for what I think ridiculous or silly reasons, however to each their own. We loved this place and our experience was great."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our Restaurant Week dinner here. I made our reservation for 7 people a week in advance. The staff member on the phone was friendly, helpful and gracious. I called the night before to reconfirm and had the same lovely experience. I was impressed.   We arrived for our 8 pm res and I was really surprised that our table was outside. The patio is pretty but it's still too hot to dine outside. I expressed my concern and displeasure that I hadn't been asked about outside dining when I called. A waitress brought water and shortly thereafter the waiter came out to say an inside table had opened up and we could move. We were all grateful to move into the AC. Their attitude was refreshing. No one acted like we had put them out.   The RW menu had nice variety but we had a lot of steak fans so many ordered the filet, mashed potatoes and asparagus. They all seemed to like their choice. I'm sure it was good but rather unimaginative. I had Moroccan lamb shank with couscous and stone fruit. A delicious melange of flavors and textures.   For dessert several chose the crime brûlée cheesecake and loved it. I had the chocolate caramel fleur de sel tart. It was tasty but super sweet - just as described by our waitress.   Speaking of wait staff, they were helpful, friendly and genuinely happy to make our evening a delight. I'm happy to recommend.  Overall, a great start to Restaurant Week!"}
{"text":"We decided to return for restaurant week to a place we've enjoyed in the past. Unfortunately, we were all disappointed. Firstly, when a table orders a bottle of wine, most upscale restaurants do not pour out the entire bottle and fill up each glass to the max. Restaurants typically provide an adequate pour and then return to fill glasses as necessary. The appetizer, shrimp stuffed calamari, was an extremely small portion and not flavorful. Frankly, the meal portions (two of us had halibut and two filet) appeared as if they had divided each fish/meat cut into two servings. Yes, one could say these are \"French portion sizes\" but given we eat at French restaurants frequently in Chicago and elsewhere, this appeared more to be a cost savings endeavor than an intensional cultural norm. My halibut was too chewy, overdone, and it came on a bed of cold green veggies. The escargot arrived, too, not hot, and without the typical crusty bread. When I complained to the owner as he circled tables that my halibut was too chewy, he didn't apologize but said, \"I will let my chef know.\"  Okay then. The desserts were the only bright spots.  It may have been the preparations for Restaurant Week fell flat, but there was something about the atmosphere, especially the owners attitude, that frankly changed our opinion about this place. We won't be back.  Three stars are generous for what should have been a special night out and pricing that even discounted made it not worth the costs."}
{"text":"This is one of those sad reviews. After more than twenty years of serving the Valley, Coup Des Tartes is closing their doors. This local French-inspired American bistro is the perfect spot for a romantic night out or any type of special occasion. The tall shady trees and the pretty lights over the large open patio make for a nice hideaway from the busy surrounding area. They also have a private dining space like the Rendezvous Room that can host meetings and they can also accommodate weddings and other outdoor events. What I always loved most about his place was the friendliness of the staff. My experiences here were always met with a warm greeting and excellent service. Sadly after being forced out of their previous location, Coup Des Tartes wasn't able to fully recover due to labor laws. I'm going to miss their exquisite seasonal menu that included some of my favorites like the Chicken Cordon Bleu, Duck a l'Orange and the Three Onion Tarte. My best memory will always be a fun Yelp event in which we were encouraged to dress in French outfits. I stopped in for one last visit and ordered their delicious French Onion Soup as I mingled with the staff. Thanks Coup Des Tartes for the memories and I hope a day comes that you make a return. Au revoir."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place.  I really did.  The atmosphere is cool, the feel of the buildings are charming, but I really have to grade my experience during Restaurant Week as average.  I came with a party of 5 and they could only seat us in the courtyard.  During Winter in Phoenix, this wouldn't be a big deal.  But even with the shade of the courtyard, it was pretty toasty.  As for the food?  My mixed green salad was pretty dry.  The heat outside might have had something to do with it, but it just wasn't that impressive.  I had heard all the hype about the lamb (part of the reason I chose this place for restaurant week and it was good.  The cous cous provided a good texture to go with it.  For dessert I went with the cherry lava cake.  Pretty good, but the cake itself was also pretty dry.  The service as a whole was fine as they fed us each meal pretty quickly.  The fact we could bring our own wines was also a plus.  Would I go back here?  Probably.  But next time I'll make a bigger push to sit inside."}
{"text":"Expensive expensive expensive!!!   But the food is stellar:  oh so good!!  They rotate the menu so my reccomendations will be moot.  Take a date here if you want a little \"dessert\" to take home later...  Also, the service is good, but the place is a bit claustrophobic."}
{"text":"This is what happens when you trust a couple tartes. Stabbed in the back! Food poisoning. Worst night of vomiting and diarrhea in my life. I had the lamb."}
{"text":"As always, they do a great job!  The food is adventurous without being pretentious.  The ambiance is cozy and special without being stuffy.  One of my favorite places for special occasions by far!"}
{"text":"I am so glad that Coup des Tartes has reopened!  My husband surprised me with reservations in May to check the new location out.  It ended up it was restaurant week, so an added bonus too.  The space is beautiful, charming and shabby chic...a little more work could go a long way.  The service was impeccable and the food was amazing.  I started with the french onion soup (perfect portion and flavor), moved on to the beef tenderloin (perfectly prepared and full of flavor) and finished with an amazing dessert.  We love that it is no longer BYOB only...great that they have a full bar to choose from now."}
{"text":"One of our family members gave us a Groupon.  Okay, I said it.  And, the meal we enjoyed at Coup des Tartes was out of this world!  I cook steaks all the time on the grill. I consider myself somewhat of a student.  But, the Filet Mignon was exceptional and worth every penny of that $33.00!  We were unaware the restaurant was in a converted house.  But this only added to our intimate dinning experience.  It feels as if you are in someone's home, and the owner is cooking for you personally. Wow. Talk about great ambiance.    The food is the real star at Coup des Tates.  We started with the Pâté de Campagne appetizer.  It's one of those standard dishes which the average french person has at least once a week for lunch.  It's served with dijon mustard, cornichons & baguette.  My french brother-in-law use to smear the Pâté on his baguette and then try to slice the thiny pickles length wise.  Very funny to watch.  As I've mentioned the Filet was delicious.  But, so was the herbed marinated Chicken Breast. How can this only be $22.00?  We finished with the Burnt Cream, the french translation of Creme Brûlée.  It was also very good.  I'm not sure if Coup Des Tartes would rank as Three Star Michelin faire, but it surely earns each of my Five Yelp Stars!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I have lived here for so long and never been before. We finally made it for brunch and it was wonderful. The building is beautiful and I loved the little dining rooms of this converted old home. Service was efficient, and incredibly friendly. This is a white table cloth restaurant but it felt very comfortable and not at all stuffy.  We enjoyed the filet Benedict and the lobster croissant, both of which came with salad on the side. Both entrees were delicious! It's not brunch without a mimosa so we enjoyed those as well. Despite being quite full we decided to share a dessert as well and enjoyed the lime mousse which was excellent and the perfect not too sweet finishing touch.  I look forward to coming back and enjoying their dinner menu and some of the special events they offer as well such as mystery dinner or jazz night."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome. The brie brûlée was so delicious.  I am hooked"}
{"text":"I made a reservation via the OpenTable website...I took my gf here for a romantic lunch and they were closed. Traveled 35 minutes here to find the doors closed. We  found a another lunch place that wasn't amazing and called it an afternoon. Kind of disappointing....but the next day I get a message from the owner/manager apologizing for not calling in advance to make we aware of the closure. I never attempted to contact the restaurant afterwards, this owner/manager called me on his own fruition. He sent me a handwritten note and a gift card to make up for the mistake. I haven't eaten here yet, but I can't wait. Just amazing customer service. What an upstanding and business savvy gentleman. Will post later after I experience their food!"}
{"text":"We've been back a couple times more since and both times we've gotten the cheese platter.  Its a little pricey at $18 but I would highly recommend it.  Last night we tried the halibut and the salmon.  Both were absolutely delicious and cooked perfectly.  I love the flavor combinations.  We had the lemon tarte to finish and once again was fully impressed.  As pricey as the menu seems, if you want to be impressed with food that really amazes pretty consistently, its worth it every time."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great service, cozy atmosphere! A bit pricy,...worth it!"}
{"text":"We here for my anniversary dinner with my boyfriend and we couldn't be happier. It didn't seem like we needed a reservation, but it could have just been because it was a slow night. We had a whole room to ourselves and our server was awesome. She took great care of us and made sure everything we ordered was to our liking. We had this one drink I can't remember the name of, but it was some kind of pear martini brandy drink. Do yourself a favor and get 2 or 3 while you are there :)"}
{"text":"We had a great night here last night for our anniversary and we brought our 23 year old son from Los Angeles to celebrate with us. We loved our night, but that was mostly because we were with this young guy who we don't get to see very often. The white bean soup had very few white beans and was basically an overly-salty italian soup. The filets were delicious but extremely overpriced as was the pork tenderloin. The service was great, and they brought a few strawberries and some whipped cream as an anniversary treat for us.   We like Coup des Tartes but the only time we can afford going here is when they offer a Groupon or some discount. Honestly, the prices on their regular menu are just sky high. It's very disconcerting when you first walk in and look at the menu. I hate to see another restaurant that we enjoy being converted to another one of those places that ONLY works when you have a Groupon in hand.   I'd like to suggest to the owners of Coup des Tartes that they take a serious look at the menu pricing and cut it back a bit. Stop with the Groupons and focus on providing a value and we'll be there once a week.  Review Updated on 8/7/2012:  Wow, did we have a disaster with this restaurant. I originally gave it a three star rating. I think their food does still merit a 3 star, but I am going to downgrade them one notch for the way I was treated the other day.  We had a Groupon (yes, they still focus on those promos) and it was going to expire in five or six days. We left a message early AM for a reservation for that night, and then never had a returned call. That was the first bad sign. When we called back and spoke to the owner, the guy was rude and just plain nasty. No, they had no reservations that night, and the other nights we suggested (mid-week) they couldn't get us in before 9 or 9:30 and so on . . .  Later, I called Groupon and asked what they suggest. They told me that as long as you make your reservation before the cut off date, the restaurant will still honor your full value of the Groupon on the date you go in, even though it is after expiration. I called and unfortunately the same guy got on the line. \"No way\" he replied - \"That's not how we work Groupons. You only get half the value - the amount you paid.\" So I put him on the line with the Groupon rep, who told us both that the guy has to honor the Groupon. Well, he opted not to do so and hung up. Honestly, this restaurant is cute and the food's not bad, but with an owner like this, why patronize them? On Saturday, when we could have been in there arguing with this fellow over our bill, we chose to have dinner at Durant's. Now THAT is a 5 star romantic restaurant. Please, avoid places like this where management is not on your side, the customer."}
{"text":"Cool unique hidden gem, very unassuming location. Food,staff, and atmosphere were great. Nice date spot, a little pricey but in my opinion totally worth it for an occasion."}
{"text":"This was the second time I have been to this neighborhood gem. After the first time we romanticized it and I was a little concerned that it would not live up to the hype my memory had created. I was not disappointed.   The food was classic and creative (brûlé brie...mmmmm) and perfect for the everyday foodie who enjoys gourmet but does not want a stuffy experience."}
{"text":"Had lunch today with my husband.  There were only two vegetarian options on the menu (not counting appetizers).  It was a choice between a rocquefort salad and another salad.  I got the first.  It was very good.  Loved the cheese, the figs, the warm apples and the toasted hazelnuts.  I was still hungry when I finished it though.  Had wished I had gotten a brie appetizer.  Wished they served some bread with the meal.  Wished the soup of the day- Butternut Squash was vegetarian instead of made with chicken broth. So I was stuck ordering a dessert because I did not want to leave hungry.  Got the sour cream key lime pie.  OMG!!!  So good!  Was the highlight of lunch... such a treat.  My husband got the special of the day which was ahi tuna tacos and a mint iced tea.  He was highly impressed- said the tacos were better than the ones at Hula's Modern Tikki.  Bill was $53 after tax and an $8 tip."}
{"text":"Coup Des Tartes is French Cuisine at it's finest ! My wife and I visited this location for our 4 year anniversary and were ecstatic after our visit. The staff was so welcoming and courteous. Our food was absolutely perfect, my wife graduated from culinary school and raved about the attention to detail and quality of their dishes. They really went above and beyond to make our night special, they treated us to a pairing of their authentic Crème Brule and a fine liqueur, so delicious! I highly suggest to everyone to make it a point to dine at this fine establishment! Cheers to Coup Des Tartes !!!!"}
{"text":"Came for Restaurant Week! So good. I had the salad, filet, and creme brulee. So delicious! Everything was cooked to perfection and we relished every bite. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We have visited this quaint historic home converted to French restaurant on two different occasions now, once for brunch and once for lunch.  Both meals were fabulous!  The Benedict's, French onion soup, sandwiches, and lunch desserts were all very flavorful and authentic tasting.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This was our second visit. The first time was great we wound out talking with other tables and had a lovely social evening. This time it was an anniversary . July so very quiet. We were greeted by the manager who was sweet and personable. We were seated in a room by ourselves . A great romantic setting. The waiter was great.Food and wine all spot on!! Surprisingly not that expensive. A real treasure in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Overall I am a big fan of this place... first how can you beat a place that is BYO???!!!  You never have to worry about a bad wine list or paying too much because it is your own stuff...  I find the food excellent... they menu is not large and changes often...  but I have never had anything that I have no liked... the chef is defiantly 5 star and since you bring in your own wine the prices don't seem that bad... but it is not exactly cheap...   The only down fall of the place is that it is real small and has funky hours... I think it is only open Wednesday to Saturday.  I know that they take reservations and I would venture to say that is the only way to actually eat there... This is a nice place for special occasions or a date..."}
{"text":"It's never too late to write a well-deserved stellar review. And it's never too late to pursue your dreams.   Ron has done a great job with Coup. I remember many fond memories at his original location off 16th street. So when we were picking bridal shower venues it was an honor to host our event at his new location back in October.   From the beginning Ron and his team were amazing. So much planning. Working with us on pricing. Helping us finalize the details. Making sure the setting - already super charming - was decorated to a T. The food was delicious. Sooooo delicious! And the beverages were lip smacking good. Of course the tarte was my favorite part. They let us bring in some outside food and the service was wonderful. No hassle here just smiles all around.   This team really understands how to make occasions a memory; They made our dreams come true.   I hope Ron and team carry on wherever their dreams take them."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place... We visited here probably 7 times over our 3 years in Phoenix.  Everyone seems to think this place is a French restaurant, and that is incorrect.  This place serves modern american food with deep roots/influence in French Bistro food.  Highlights:  Food -- We've eaten pretty much the entire gamut of the menu.  Favorites include the Pate de Campagne, Baked Feta and apples, all of the salads, pork loin, filet, chicken, lamb with couscous, and the desserts.   MMMMMMMM the desserts.  The lemon tarte and the Grand Canyon (haven't seen that on the menu in a while) are devine.  Service-- Always have had great luck here.  The staff is very attentive and know when to check in and when to leave you alone.    BYOB -- Love this!  I hate having to purchase wines limited on whatever list the restaurant has.  The corkage fee is very reasonable, and they   Atmosphere -- A hidden gem right outside of the Biltmore area.  We love the cozy, romantic atmosphere.  Nice little courtyard outside is perfect to take a break in before desset.  I prefer the clientele here over those that go to say Zinc Bistro in Scottsdale.    My only real criticism of this place is the fact that their menu does change based upon the seasons and ingrediants available.  So, if you look on the website, you might want to call ahead to make sure they have that specific dish that you are craving!!!    (OK, not really a criticism, but it is hard to find faults in this place...)"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with several smaller,intimate dining rooms. The food is great, the service is excellent and we, like several other diners that night, were personally greeted and thanked by the owner for coming in. The menu is imaginative and had so many delicious-sounding options it was hard to choose! (I chose the sea scallops, they were AMAZING). Though not traditional French, many of the entrees were reminiscent of dishes I tried while traveling in France. The featured wine list has local and international selections; a full bar and a craft-cocktail menu. Overall it was like stepping into an authentic Paris bistro. I look forward to eating there again!"}
{"text":"Ok I LOVED their lobster dinner wtih mango risotto.  LOVED IT.  Well worth the $36.  Reason for 4 stars?  I didn't like their desserts.... which was what I was most excited for.  I got the smores tart, which was to be a graham cracker crust with chocolate ganache and marshmellow.  Sounds amazing, yes?   It was just ok. Reason for it just being ok, the chocolate ganache filling tasted straight up like pudding.  Puddin'.  Seriously. Big let down.  My hubby got the chocolate creme brulee.... and it... tasted just like..... wait for it..... waittttttttt for it................  PUDDIN'!  WTF?!!?  Aghhhhhhhhh!!!  I do, however, REALLY love that this place is BYOB, so I shall return and give them another chance at dessert."}
{"text":"Third time back.  This is my 9 year old daughter's favorite restaurant for special celebrations.  Maybe because the portions are sized for her.    Just kidding.  Sort of.  Always good food.  Sometimes terrific.  But never consistently, hit the ball out of the park good.    The bill creeps up on you.  We can't ever seem to walk out the door with less than $80-120 bill for 2-3.    Last night, had the filet.  At maybe 5 ournces, bigger and more substantial than the last time, when I think I paid $32 for 2 ounces.  Seriously.  Last time the steak was perfect.  This time, they overcooked it, but I didn't have the heart to send it back.  So my wife ate it and enjoyed it, and I got her salmon.  Salmon was just okay.  BUT, the bed of rissoto, one of my favorite dishes, was delightfully rich and creamy.  Overall, it's not a terrible value.  And it's a cute little french restaurant.  COMPLETELY and totally not appropriate for small children, so don't even try.  Great date place.  Whatever you do, you MUST try two things:    1) Onion Tart - it's just a slice and a side salad as an appetizer, but OH what a slice.  2) Berry Tart - the deserts are what makes this place go.  Save room.    Remember this:  IF YOU GO TO A RESTAURANT WITH TART IN ITS NAME, AND DON'T ORDER A TART... well, what can I say.  Just don't do it.  Will be back, as I always have, and will promise to only feel slightly mugged next time I pay the bill."}
{"text":"Overall we had a great experience.  It is BYOB which I think is good, as long as you know that ahead of time.  Everybody enjoyed their food and appetizers however the tomato and mozarella appetizer fell flat and was uninspiring.    The black and white desert tarte was out of this world good.    My only beef was that there as a child there playing a video game at his table that was loud enough it could be heard from about 12' away and the waitress didn't seem very interested in doing anything about it.  I'd expect that at Macaroni grill, but not at a $34/plate joint like this."}
{"text":"quaint and eclectic! a good place to go for a romantic evening. it feels like someone's home.  also it's byob and there's a small patio off to the side that's great when the weather permits.  beware tho - everything and i mean everything tastes really sweet"}
{"text":"Serendipity of fabulous food, wine and staff. It was serendipitous that I had driven by this restaurant a few times on my way home from work when traffic was less than desirable. I thought to myself \"I bet that place is really good\" and I made a note in my phone. I understand they had been in a previous location but I had never been to their previous location. Tonight we enjoyed our first meal here. This house turned restaurant has great character, history and warmth. We savored the escargot and steak tar tar. The Roquefort salad had amazing flavor. We delighted in the perfectly blended flavors of the halibut with seaweed, scallops with cauliflower and salad and the Moroccan lamb shank with cous cous. All enjoyed with a wonderful super Tuscan wine. The staff is very much a team and provides great service. They also have a fabulous outdoor area that we will enjoy in the spring. The owner has done a superb job of turning this old house into a delightful restaurant full of flavor and great service.  Hidden gem!"}
{"text":"So sad to hear that they have to close. This was fine dining at it's best. Only got to go once. was looking to go again and again. The food, service, atmosphere, just everything was top notch!!"}
{"text":"First and foremost if you're planning to go...get some good wine or find a friend with a taste for the stuff and have them pick you out something to bring, they do not have any on hand and their food goes very well with it.  We started off with the 3-onion tarte which was absolutely delicious, perfectly baked and you could taste each of the three throughout the tarte.  I chose the chicken and my partner in crime chose the lamb shank.  The chicken was again cooked just right and the sauce complimented both it and the seasoned mashed potatoes wonderfully.  The green beans that came with it had a great flavor but I felt they weren't cooked enough, felt more raw than al dente.  I had some of the lamb shank, it was literally falling of the bone and a fork was all that was needed to pull off pieces to dip in the harisa-flavoured couscous.  Now I'm not one for the game flavor of lamb and this had none of the taste, just a wonderful taste overall.  We settled for the special of the night, a pear tarte with french vanilla ice cream.  The perfect ending to the dinner.  The sugary filling did not detract from the pears and went well with the ice cream.    Even though I had a groupon for this experience, I can say the experience of such a small and intimate setting will make me want to come back many more times.  This place is definitely somewhere to take a first date you're wanting to sweep them off their feet, or panties."}
{"text":"My New Favorite Place to eat in the Phoenix Area. Coup Des Tartes is Unique in the design and the food is Amazing!   I reside near the Old Town Scottsdale area but will be making the drive to 17th Strret and Osborn frequently for more delicious meals."}
{"text":"I'd give it one star, but I should've realized it would be hard to find 'French' cuisine in the Southwest. What I got served doesn't qualify as 'French'. The place is cramped and the seating is ill inspired, to say the least. In order to make room for more seats, table space is sacrificed, along with enough elbow room to fit a regular-sized individual. Romantic? Don't think so, unless your idea of romance is sharing a 12X15 room with about 20 other diners. If so, you should look into a bistro, and pay bistro prices. I don't recommend this to anyone looking for either a meal, or a deal. Good luck with the parking!"}
{"text":"Went for Restaurant Week with a friend. Adorable little place, wonderful atmosphere. The squid was just slightly overcooked but everything else was perfect. Service was great. Bring your own wine."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere. Sea bass with coconut topping is delicious Filet is tendered and flavorful Pear and apple tarts are perfect compliment to the dinner Would recommend sitting outside"}
{"text":"I loved this place. My cousin took me here for the first time six years ago. I remember their slightly melted brie with fruit. I sometimes even ordered two.  For dessert, their tarts were always fresh and delicious. I would stop by sometimes just to pick up a fruit tart. Their lemon tart was tangy and good. Everything I've tried has been great, but it's their brie and fruit tart that caused sighs of happiness."}
{"text":"Fabulous ambiance! Fantastic food! Great hospitality! The owner, Ron is awesome. The bartender Derek is awesome. Every time we go there, whether it's for dinner or the fabulous Happy Hour we have a fantastic time. We like to take our out of town guests to this gem."}
{"text":"I was there with friends on Friday for Happy Hour and dinner. We enjoyed the music out on the patio on HH. Then we had dinner. Everything was very good. The service was excellent. Wes and Helena took very good care of us. Thank you! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is the cutest place in an old house. It has lots of ambiance, romantic, and it is quiet so you can have a conversation. They also have a really cute patio with a fireplace and there was music for Sunday brunch.  It is a plus that you can now order cocktails. We have been there about 5 times in the last 5 weeks for lunch, dinner and brunch. The food is delicate and very flavorful. It is a nice escape compared to the rat race of many other restaurants."}
{"text":"I purchased an Elite dining membership which entitles me to get two-for-one entrées at restaurants in the program. I called the restaurant to make sure that I can come in by myself and get the buy one get one free. I've done this with every restaurant in the program but the owner Ron said he had heard that you have to have two people dining to take advantage of this but that I can come in and do it anyway one time. I ordered the scallops first which were pretty good and ordered the filet as my second dish. The filet was just bad. It didn't smell right or taste right. Very disappointing. The server came by and I told her the steak wasn't good and she asked if I wanted to order something else. I said I would try the salmon. A few minutes later Ron comes to and asked me what's wrong with the steak clearly annoyed. I told him it tasted old and didn't taste right. He said it was all because it's aged which sounded ridiculous. He kept on insisting there was nothing wrong with the steak instead of trying to be helpful like most managers or owners will be at a restaurant. He said I'll give you a piece of salmon and walked off shaking his head. This really pissed me off. The next time I saw him I asked him why I would return my meal and wait another half an hour for something else if there wasn't anything wrong. Just because I'm getting a two-for-one deal doesn't mean that I should be treated like crap as a customer. Just be warned that in case something is wrong with your meal and you try to send it back, you may be in for a stressful and unpleasant meal."}
{"text":"After being called \"Girls\" at every single encounter with the waiter at lunch today, and forgiving it every single time, as we were leaving, and again told \"Goodbye Girls\" I said, do me a favor. I'm not a girl. The waiter said he was trying to be nice, make me seem younger. (Whoa, doggie!) I said he wouldn't like being called \"Boy\" and he said it was different. I said he was right, because society didn't discriminate against men. Then he called me sensitive. DAMN STRAIGHT!  I'm sensitive to discrimination.  The food was great. Boy waiter was very slow. I loved that the owner came out and welcomed us."}
{"text":"For fresh American faire with a French twist this homey little cottage with hardwood floors will tickle your fancy!  The owner is also the head Chef and the menu changes regularly.  Fresh salads featuring a little fruit and nuts is my favorite aperitif.  Seafood is usually featured, along with chicken, light cream sauces and nicely sized portions that a girl can actually finish.  This is a great place for a romantic dinner, or girls night out before the theatre, or intimate dinner with another couple.  I believe they now have a liquour license that allows for wine service and maybe more?!  A back room is available for larger groups, call ahead to reserve it.  Reservations recommended, in general.  Only open for dinner.  Moderate to upscale prices."}
{"text":"My husband and I had \"date night\" here on Saturday.  I really enjoyed it, he thought it was average.  There is little ro no \"curb appeal\" when you get there, it looks pretty bad from the outside actually, but inside I thought it was very quaint and cozy.  I could see how it could get stuffy as others have mentioned, but we ate somewhat early and didn't feel that way even though it was 90 plus outside.  It can get loud inside too.  You'd like to think that people will be conscious of their surroundings and use their \"inside voices\" but....  If you are considering this place for more than 4 people, do all the date night couples a favor and go elsewhere.  It really isn't equipped to handle a larger group unless you eat outside.  We knew in advance to bring our own wine, but I agree it would be nice to be able to order a cocktail.  It isn't like there is someplace next door you can grab one before you come in and sometimes you just want to start a nice meal with a little aperitif.  If they don't want to go for a whole liquor license, they could easily get a beer and wine and that would allow them to serve things like Lillet which would be a lovely way to start.  We had the brie because it was one of their specialities.  I actually am not crazy about brie but wanted to sample it.  The fruit was all really good and fresh, but the portion of bruleed apples on top of the brie was very small.  A good concept for a dish, but execution could make it really shine.  The apples could be truly carmelized, more liquid apple juice and caramel, maybe with some spices, would be so excellent with fresh pear and baguette.  I had the Taleggio salad and my husband had the tomato and mozzarella.  The Taleggio salad was great, very generous portion and well dressed.  The Tom/Mozza was very average - nothing at all special.  My husband had the pecan crusted chicken and I had the lobster papardelle.  Both entrees were great, the proteins were cooked perfectly and seasoning was great.  I never found myself wanting to reach for the salt, which I often do.  We were too full to finish but leftovers were welcomed the next day.  I wish I had foregone the Brie for dessert, we were too full to order a tarte and I think we really missed out.  That Samoa one sounded like heaven!  My husband thought it was overpriced for above average, but not great, food - if I can talk him into going back I will make sure and order that Samoa tart!"}
{"text":"This is our family's favorite restaurant.  The owner is present and makes himself known.  The staff is friendly and makes you feel at home.  The fact that you can bring your own wine in makes it so much more fun.  It's a house that's been converted to a restaurant so it's very quaint but its very charming.  They always make our special occasions memorable.  We love to start with the Brie, we love the Filet and the Sea Bass as entrees.  Dessert is always amazing.  This restaurant does not disappoint!"}
{"text":"We had a FABULOUS experience at Coup Des Tartes a few nights ago.  We found it on Yelp as one of the few BYOBs in the Phoenix area, especially those in the interesting menu category!    I was a little concerned when we first arrived as the line was out the front door, and I was hoping our Open Table reservations were valid and in good standing.  A bit of a wait to the desk, but once there, we were warmly welcomed and immediately shown to our table - by the owner, in fact!  We led out with a brie brulee cheese with apple slices and another interesting app that alludes me now (Carpaccio, I think) - could have made a meal of the appetizers alone.  Carol had the lamb shank - tender and well seasoned, I had the Gnocchi with seafood - a bit shocked to see that all the seafood was still in the shell and required a bit of excavating.  Worth the work - just not quite what I expected.  We all split the chocolate pecan tort for dessert.  Amazing.  It's a very small restaurant - the kind of place you'd drive by a hundred times without noticing in a sort of marginal neighborhood   Once inside, you almost feel like you're dining in someone's home dining room.  Cozy and intimate.  And the owner stopped by once or twice during the evening to make sure we were having a positive experience.  (Even decanted our wine without us asking!)     A few earlier reviews seemed displeased with the lack of a wine list and the pricey menu.  Guess I don't get it - I'm from the east and think the ability to bring your own bottle is a privilege (get what you want for a 1/3 of the price) then spend the difference on a really nice meal.  For us, the meal was worth every penny.  Wished we lived closer so we could become regulars!!"}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week.  Food was great.  Our server wasn't much to write home about.  I heard other servers describing dishes-for example the butternut squash soup had a kick to it as well as some pesto integrated.  My hubby had and it was yummy!  She did not indicate any of this and seemed rather clueless about the food when we asked opinions.   LOVED their lobster mashed potatoes, don't believe our bison was cooked to medium rare as indicated. FYI, there was apparently a mix-up with the price, $29 was indicated on the restaurant week website, but their menu said $39.  They were kind enough to honor $29 after we spoke up."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here and had a great time. We were placed in front of the fire and it made the entire dinner that much better. The cheese platter was filled with a bunch of different things that complimented each other and the rest of the dinner did not disappoint"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience! Incredible food, very friendly staff, great drinks, amazing intimate atmosphere! I love this place!  It used to be two houses, that was at some point connected to be a larger office, then eventually became this beautiful atmospheric restaurant! Such a beautiful date night."}
{"text":"Fabulous, intimate French Bistro in Phoenix. Authentic French food and almost all French wine list. Filet Mignon was tender, cooked to perfection with a wonderful mushroom sauce that was not overpowering. Service was excellent but lagged a bit at times. Still a 5 star experience. Great decor with small intimate rooms. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What a charming, cozy restaurant! I went to lunch there for the first time. Onion Tarte is savory and delicious. The Roquefort salad is a good mix of savory cheese and the sweet apples and figs. The fillet torta is nice. DON'T skip dessert. I can't say enough good things about their pear tarte. Crumbly, buttery crust, and the tarte filling is so smooth with great vanilla flavor. The pear tarte was so good it made me cry!"}
{"text":"I ate here tonight and can honestly say this was one of the best meals I've eaten in phoenix for some time. I had lamb shank, champagne , French onion soup and a wonderful desert. This was my first time at the new location which was very nice. I will definitely visit again soon! Great food, excellent server and overall friendly staff!"}
{"text":"If you're on Twitter you'll see so many different places you can follow. Its cool to because they announce deals and such that are coming soon. For instance, Coup des Tartes tweeted that they would be running the Yelp Eats menu this past Friday and Saturday. I was super excited because the night I was supposed to go there was a family emergency and I had to cancel. Anyway, once we arrived we were given the standard menu so we asked about the Yelp Eats menu, \"oh yeah sure\". What was brought back was not the Yelp Eats menu but some 3 course prix fix menu for $25 that didn't even have one Yelp Eats item on it. No onion tart, no lamb shank etc.. VERY disappointing and irritating. Do not call a Ferrari a Corvette, no matter how you slice it, they aren't the same thing.   Anyway.. ended up ordering the pate and onion tart appetizers. The pate is not house made and tasted like liverwurst, the onion tart was very good. However, once we learned that there was no wine service and a (correction, not $12) $9 corkage fee, that was the nail in the coffin, we were out the door.   At the end of the day they falsely tweeted to get customers in the door then try to pass off something that isn't. Very misleading, the classic bait and switch apparently still works."}
{"text":"We tried CDT on Sat. Opening a restaurant in what used to be a single-family home is interesting but impractical. Having several \"cozy\" (small) dining rooms scattered throughout a building isn't great: the tables are too close together so no conversation is private. It's tough for servers to adequately keep track of their tables as they end up with tables in different rooms. It's always harder to serve a section where you can't see all your tables at once. Ours was a friendly gal who was really nice and chatty, though a bit scattered. She seemed to be playing catch up on her tables. She apparently got several tables seated in her section at once and I know what a nightmare this is. All your tables need you there at the same time for every stage of service for the duration. It's impossible to give thoughtful, efficient service if they get more than 2 tables at once without at least a 5-10 min spacer. That way their tables would be at different stages and everyone gets good service. There is  skill to timing seating. We got seated in a small room near a window and were sharing it with a table of 4 other guests. Originally likely a bedroom, it felt as though we were part of each others conversations which I find distracting. Our server brought us water and explained the menu. Strange: they offer Moules Frites which in Belgium and France is Muscles (Moules) and fries (Frites), but they don't actually serve fries in this place we were told, so the Moules Frites are just Moules. I speak French and this is absurd. Call it something else like Moules Traditionelles but don't mislabel the dish. Imagine trying to order the Steak and Eggs and being told they don't  serve eggs in the place? We ordered a bottle of Zin off their eclectic, interesting and well-priced wine list. I won't go on about the BYOB, wine club, corking fee biz. When I'm out to dinner, exploring the wine list and choosing from what the owners deem suitable to accompany their food is part of the dining experience. What's next? Bring your own Amuse Bouche? \"Yes I believe we will start with this can of sardines and Ritz crackers I got at Safeway.\"  It's make-work.  I wondered if they had sent someone to Sonoma California to pick up the wine we'd ordered, as after 10 mins it still had yet to arrive at the table. Our server returned, sans wine, to take our food order, which in good service is bad. We decided to share the Caesar salad and Pate Campagne to start followed by the Short Rib Pappardelle pour elle and the Crispy Maple Duck Breast pour moi. Our sever said that they could split the salad onto two plates. She also suggested we course it: start with the pate, then the salad, then the mains. Perfect! A few mins later, our server, sans wine, brought out a Caesar salad (not split. not the pate) and plopped it down in front of my wife and left. Then a guy FINALLY appeared with the wine we ordered. Imagine we're in a \"high-end\" restaurant and the first incorrect course has arrived at the table, inaccurately presented and before the wine. Straight up bad service timing. Someone then appeared with the pate and placed it in front of me. I guess we weren't coursing the appies.  Wine guy opens and pours. He seemed uncomfortable and nervous pouring and spilled some on the tablecloth. I guess in the old place the guests brought their wines and poured it. Perhaps some of the staff aren't yet comfortable opening and pouring wine. I could do a training session and have them up to par and confident in no time. I poured the wine hence forth, as no one else was ever around to do it. We clumsily scraped some of the salad onto my side plate which I hate doing because then it looked like a goat's breakfast. The salad had a nice delicate dressing that was perfect. The lettuce was crunchy and had a mouth-feel more akin to Kale. The pate was okay. It had an interesting flavor and was served with delightfully hot mustard and some mini cornichons.  The Crispy Maple Duck wasn't crispy at all. It was smothered in a maple cream sauce that soaked any crispiness out of it; disappointing, as I love crispy duck. The breast was perfectly medium and the sauce was exquisite. It came with some very creamy mashed potatoes so I had a deliciously creamy experience.   My wife said the Short Rib Pappardelle was excellent. The pasta was perfect and the meat very tender. She said the sauce was amazing. No one ever appeared at the table to do a quality check on our mains. We had long finished eating before our server came back. Don't get me wrong, we liked her, she made up for it in personality. BTW, we never once saw or interacted with a Manager. I tipped well. We MIGHT try this place again. In fine dinning it's great food and great execution by the establishment as a team that make the dining experience wonderful. It's a dance that needs to be practiced and timed from back of house to front and this place isn't quite ready to Dance With The Stars just yet."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is superb. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the owner. He was very friendly and welcoming.  The food was delicious, fresh, and creative.  In addition, the service was fantastic. The live music added a nice touch."}
{"text":"What's the Deal? (why the rating) I've been here 3 times in 10 years. Yes, that is not often. Why you ask. Let me tell you...  Bang for the Buck: 2/5 - I believe there are better places in Phx that have more creative dishes, just as high quality food and good service. And the corkage fee here is too high. $9 per bottle is high especially since they don't open the bottle and you must ask for a decanter if you want one. The first time I did not know and they were \"out\" of decanters... there were only 2. They need to adopt a $1/glass fee which would be more than reasonable to cover cleaning costs and also ask us if we want a decanter... and have enough for at least half the tables.  Decor: 2/5 - nothing special. Old house converted to a restaurant so it looks like a small plain old house with small dining tables in it.  Ambiance: 3/5 - very small, old house in a bad part of town. Just look for the thrift store on the corner and watch out for the homeless & transients so you don't hit them on your way into the parking lot - no joke, this almost happened Friday night. Not quaint, or romantic, or unique. You are crowded in a very small room with an 8 foot (low!) ceiling with a bunch of people. The place gets loud quickly. Not sure how people call this place romantic... I guess if you invite 30 other people to create noise in your bedroom when you are intimate with your partner, this is your kind of place ;-)  Service: 5/5 - very friendly and accommodating. I was not happy with my meal and they replaced it quickly and happily.  Food Quality: 5/5 - this is the standout here... food quality is very very good  Food Quantity: 3/5  - small portions for the price.  Food Flavor: 4/5 - they do very well in this area. all items we had were excellent.  Food Uniqueness & Creativity: 3/5 - they do ok here but not enough to warrant the high prices vs other places.  Last Experience...  9/24/2010 We went for the $30 Restaurant Week menu. The lamb shank was excellent, this is a house favorite. They also has bison steak with a nice mushroom burgundy sauce. The sauce flavor was excellent but the bison was very tough and hte portion was the size of a thick silver dollar - not an exaggeration. It was like 2-3 bites worth.  They said bison is so lean that it is tough. I could not enjoy it so they offered to replace it for me which was appreciated since I loved the lamb shank."}
{"text":"There's just something missing at Coup Des Tartes. How do they say? \"je ne sais quoi...\"?  The interior ambiance is perfect. Probably the highlight.  On my most recent visit, I had the three onion tarte, which has a lovely sweet flavor and the salmon. The salmon was so ordinary. It was cooked well but something was missing from the preparation for me. However, I loved, loved, loved the savory butternut squash risotto. If only the salmon had been as \"ah mah zing\" (citing the menu) as the risotto was!  I've had the chicken option before, too. It was just fine.   But, nothing has blown me away.   And, bringing your own wine to enjoy has the potential to really compliment the whole experience. Make it richer.  The fact that it'll cost you $9 minimum just to open it (a task you literally do yourself) is a sore spot for me. I think that corking fee is waaay too high!   It's fun to go to coup Des Tartes because the ambiance and you know you'll order a tarte for dessert. It's like, that you'll enjoy dessert is guaranteed -- but, there's something -- that \"je ne sais quoi...\" that's still lacking..."}
{"text":"Amazing foods and service. What a wonderful birthday treat. The pork tenderloin was to die for and the French Martini was like the unicorn of martinis."}
{"text":"Romantic BYOB place.  A little pricey, the food tends towards meditteranean/french influence but tasty.  I come really for the desserts (which they will do for take out).  A nice place for a lunch or romantic dinner.  Also, you can have them cater baby showers and birthday parties in the house next door."}
{"text":"Coup Des Tartes is a solid 4 stars with the potential of being 5 stars with a few menu updates.  After reading some of the Yelper reviews I was a bit perplexed about what to expect when a friend invited me to join him at Coup Des Tartes.  After h told me this is a BYO, pas de probleme ~ you can count me in!!   First off, there are not enough fine dinning BYO places in Phoenix!  PLEASE HELP ME SPREAD THIS THROUGHOUT THE VALLEY!!  It's a \"good time\" when you're able to bring your favorite wines with you to dine and not pay the restaurant's prices.  Especially when it's at a place that offers quality food and service at reasonable prices.   Sure there is a \"cork fee\", but I look at it this way ~ I would rather pay $9 for the \"cork fee\" and $30 for a bottle of Chateau La Galiane Cabernet Sauvignon I can buy at Total Wine, which would cost $100 (plus) at any other fining dinning restaurant.   Their food and drink pricing is very reasonable considering the quality and taste. This is where I think CDT has an opportunity to improve.  They have a limited menu and since they are a French restaurant, they should think about offering some of the more updated French dishes.  A stereotypical French meal is heavy in saturated fats; heavy creams and butter which are staples in many French dishes and what CDT offers is no different.  Think about offering some of the newer French style dishes that include crepes, more game meats and sea food dishes.  Appetizer~ their delicious three onion Tart and it was excellent! (sweet and savory and decadent).  We also had the Mate Horn and the Mozzarella and Tomato Salad which was very good.   Entrees~ the Filet Mignon, cooked mid-rare of course with sides of mashed potatoes and haricots verts.  I had their signature dish: the Lamb Shank.  It was extremely meaty, \"fall off the bone\" tender. The couscous was very fresh and it had just the right amount of veggies and sauce to pull everything together.    Desert~ Pumpkin Tarte and fresh cup of French café.  It was also very good.    Service~ exceptional.  They were extremely attentive and very friendly, but not too friendly if you know what I mean...  They brought us a wine decanter and an aerator without asking.  The place is very quaint with somewhat of a homely feel and yet very simple in décor.   Wine~ FANTASTIQUE!  Will plan to bring a second bottle next time!"}
{"text":"My fiance brought me to Coup Des Tartes right after we got engaged - so I have some fondness for this place. It's so funny, because we actually saw another couple get engaged while we were dining!   This is a cute little restaurant - and yes, the apple tart we had for dessert was delicious.... the man had the filet, and i ordered the lamb (what else) - while the food was tasty, i wasn't exactly blown away. but the service is superb, and it's a cute/quaint little place. and yes, I had just gotten engaged. so i love them. 4 stars for being special in my memory and 3.5 stars for the food.  but it was really odd bc usually, don't they comp dessert or send you free ice cream or something when you get engaged/married/have a birthday? yeah.... nothing. and our waitress even asked me about our engagement. hrm. it was just odd."}
{"text":"Yes, the food is good - some things, like the Brie appetizer are even great. I wanted to try the lamb, the house speciality, but they were out. My date's pork was good - the risotto it came with was delicious. My sea bass was slightly overcooked and I didn't care for the relish it came with. I like the ambiance, my date disagreed - he thought it was loud - it's true we could hear all the conversations around us; but food and ambiance aside, my gripe is with CST's customer service.  I purchased a $25 gift certificate for CDT on restaurants.com a month ago. When we went to redeem it, we were told, \"oh, i'm sorry, we don't honor those anymore...you should be able to contact restaurants.com and get a refund.\" End of story. No visit from the manager, no complimentary desert. Nothing.  We were not the only people that came in that night trying to use our certificate, the table next to us also had one. We went in that night because of the certificate - some people get them to try a new place - i got it cause i needed a little extra incentive to go back to CDT - I remembered the food being good but a bit pricy - $25 off seemed like a nice discount. Whatever, the reason, restaurants count on sites such as restaurants.com to bring in people to their establishments. We upheld our end of the agreement - we went in, ordered more  than just the 2 entree min (app, salad, corakge fee) but CDT did not uphold their end of the agreement - and in my opnion, that is horrible customer service. The certificate was supposed  to be good for a year - it's not like we tried  to use it close to the expiration date, I tried using it one month after purchasing it. Even worse is that CDT has not contacted restaurants.com to let them know that they are no longer honoring it.  Luring customers with a gift certificate and not honoring it is a bad business practice."}
{"text":"I held an event here for 34 very special people.  The venue was perfect, the food was phenomenal and service impeccable.  Highly recommend Coup De Tartes for your next event."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try Coup des Tartes for a long time and was VERY disappointed!   First, kudos to management for their flexibility in allowing me to make a reservation for a date past the expiration date of my Groupon--much appreciated! Service was very good.   FOOD: Bread was plentiful and good. The appetizers were WONDERFUL--the brie was very good (love the candied apple) and the onion tart (while a bit small in portion size) was over the top delicious! The entrees, however, were fair.   My husband ordered pork tenderloin which wasn't particularly tender and was bland in flavor. I ordered the much ballyhooed lamb shank and found it to be lackluster--the sauce was good, but the lamb was just OK and overall it lacked flavor. I've had much better lamb elsewhere.  I was VERY surprised, given the many raves here on Yelp! The entrees were especially disappointing given they were rather expensive. Lots of other restaurants at this price point and below with much better food than we experienced.  Unfortunately, I didn't have time to try dessert. But I won't be going back. :("}
{"text":"Sitting on the patio eating Pate with a nice bottle of wine - can't beat that.  Well you couldn't beat it if the patio didn't look like the inside of my garage.  Indoors is pretty nice and the Pate is good."}
{"text":"We were huge fans of the original Coup Des Tartes on 16th street.  We followed along on the progress of the new location, but it admittedly took us awhile to check it out.  Even so, it was worth the wait... As our hostess put it, the new location is like the old one on steroids!    We toured and dined here on a spontaneous date night over the weekend.  We went for early bird dinner on Saturday; I guess that's what happens when you have young kids sometimes ;)  It's worth noting that we noticed two parties with young children dining while we were there.  It's not a place I would typically think to bring my kids, but they do accommodate, have highchairs, etc... I love the many rooms at the new location.  It was perfect for our intimate date night, but this would also be a fabulous place to go with a bunch of couples.  It's also worth noting that while I miss the BYOB option of the former location, CDT now offers a full selection of cocktails, beer and wine.  (You can BYOB if you join their Wine Club for $45 / year).  Nicole was our server and she was just the right amount of attentive and sweet.  So fashionable as well.   Jared and I shared the signature Roquefort Salad, 3 Onion Tarte, and Halibut entree. We each enjoyed a glass of wine as well.  The kitchen split the salad and entree for us for an additional charge, but also made sure portions were still generous with the sides.  I recommend allowing them to do this.  Everything we experienced was fresh and delicious, made with creative preparations of locally-sourced ingredients.  We were too full for dessert, so we'll have to return again soon for that... their brunch menu sounds fabulous too!"}
{"text":"My parents were in town a few weeks ago, and when my parents are in town, we like to take them to restaurants that they've never been to before.  My dad appreciates good food, and we had a feeling he'd like Coup Des Tartes, so that's where we found ourselves on that particular Saturday night.  We brought the wine (a bottle of red and a bottle of white) and my parents picked up the tab... such a deal!  We were seated in the back room - one I'd never even seen before... there was just our table and three other tables in the little room.  I convinced my mom to share the signature salad with me to start... and although Jared asked my dad to share the onion tart as an appetizer, my dad insisted on ordering his own.  (It worked out though, so I was able to take a few bites of the tart too).  For our meals, my mom and Jared went with the chicken, I had the salmon, and my dad went for the steak.  My fish was cooked just perfectly and served with an amazing butternut squash risotto and some green beans too.  Everyone enjoyed their meals and despite the fact that we were all pretty full, we went ahead and ordered the mixed berry tart with four forks for dessert.  We cleaned that plate too.  Needless to say, we were right about my dad enjoying his meal at Coup Des Tartes.  We've always had great meals at Coup Des Tartes and we're sure to be back again real soon."}
{"text":"I have been a follower since the establishment on 16th Street. The move to Osborn provided more space and even better ambience. Sadly, the Coup Des Tartes will be closing their doors Jan 31st. This is one of the few excellent restaurants with a corking fee, and the steak was well worth bringing along the Stags Leap 2005 Cask 23. The salmon was very good.  I am indeed very sorry that this fine establishment could not stay, maybe someday they will return again."}
{"text":"The food was great and the atmosphere wonderful. The restaurant was nice and quite and you could have a conversation with each other without yelling like the newer restaurants.  Service was efficient."}
{"text":"Must try! I never recommend places... However I could not resist Coup Des Tartes...Such a warm and cozy French restaurant in the middle of Phoenix! Love, love this place and definitely will be back and hope to throw my birthday party here as well! The food is amazing (I had the scallops and my husband had the short rib pasta); the service is wonderful and we even had special hospitality from the owner Ron! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Overall, the food was great - at least most of it. We did have some soup (\"Country Style\" French Onion) that I found to be unremarkable. Service was friendly and attentive but somewhat slow. It worked out ok since we weren't in a hurry but don't expect to be in and out of this restaurant quickly, even with a reservation. It would almost be romantic but they pack a few too many people in to the small space. Quarters are close. We had a GroupOn which made dinner at this restaurant more affordable but dinner was still pricey. Lunch is priced lower if you want to try to the food without the cost."}
{"text":"My Fiance and I have been coming here for the last 3 years. Food and service is as advertised. Its a bit on a expensive side but we're firm believers that you get what you pay for. Their fillet has to be one of the best in town. Every time we go they pare it differently and I love that. The old building was small and romantic, can't wait to visit the new building. It's a must try on a special ocassion!"}
{"text":"I have had mixed experiences at Coup Des Tartes.  My husband and I have gone there a few times for dinner.  The first couple of experiences were great but we had a not-so-great dinner the other night and it cost enough that I felt the need to yelp about it.    First of all, they have a great menu and I really like the fact that they are BYOB for beer and wine (which ends up saving a significant amount of money).    A small downer is how closely the tables are placed together.  Be prepared to hear the conversation of everyone around you, and to have them hear yours.  It would be really nice to have 25% less tables in the place.  In the past we have tried the cheese plate appetizer, the onion tart appetizer, the Bree and pear appetizer, and the Filet entree, and a couple of their tart desserts.  They were all really good. The steak was cooked well and both the savory and sweet tarts were really yummy.    Last week we went in for my husband's b-day; it was a busy Saturday night.  The place was packed and their banquet facility next door was also serving guests.    We ordered a couple of appetizers; they were really slow getting to the table, but good to eat.  We had both ordered the lobster risotto for our entree at the same time we ordered the apps.  The entrees were also really slow getting to us.  When I tried to use my fork to cut into the lobster tail, it was like rubber.  The top of the tail was like a solid sheet of rubber and then the meat below was dry and really over cooked.  Both of us had this problem and so did the table next to us.  At $38 a pop, everyone was really disappointed.  We didn't bother to send it back because I am typically against doing that at restaurants.  I am sure they would have re-cooked us new lobster tails, but who knows how long that would have taken.    We will try Coup Des Tartes again but probably not on a Friday or Saturday night.  If we have another bad experience, that will be the end of this place for us.  If you want to save some cash at Coup Des Tartes, you can get a $25 gift certificate for $10 on restaurant.com.  You can only use one per visit and you have to buy to entrees, but it will save you $15!"}
{"text":"Gah! Was not impressed. Found out at the end that the owner was actually serving us. Drinks were not good, food was ok, nothing memorable. Atmosphere was really cool, very cute place. Just disappointed. Came on a Sunday afternoon, expecting it to be very busy, turns out, we almost had the place to ourselves."}
{"text":"Don't know why I only gave it 4 stars last time, but this place is deff worth 5!  Everything is still as delicious as I remember from last time, if not better.  Can't wait to go again sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now. After latest dinner, I remember why I don't revisit more frequently. Truth be told, the food is just not THAT great. For a menu of $10+ appetizers and $25+ dinner entries I expect a delicious unforgettable meal. Wouldn't you?   Everything I've tried - house specials, salmon, chicken, filet mignon, duck, even bread- wasn't remarkable or rave-to-friends-worthy. Certainly not worth the price. And that $10 corking fees per bottle of wine? I had to open it myself...  Like others I've experienced somewhat cold greeter yet great service from our servers.   If you are thinking twice about placing reservations, I advice you look elsewhere. There are MANY suburb restaurants in surrounding areas with better dishes. Do your research.  But hey, if you're looking to sit uncomfortably in a tiny \"bedroom\" of a house shelling out extra $10 ($15 for a magnum bottle) on BYOW, mediocre food, and absolutely nothing FRENCH in a so called \"French\" restaurant, go right ahead! être mon invité.."}
{"text":"Dined at Coup Des Tartes last night for Restaurant Week. Very busy night, bustling little place.  The restaurant is located in a cottage and its courtyard/patio on 16th Street. Parking was a bit challenging, they have a small lot. We poached a spot in the adjacent apartment complex. CDT is BYOB with a 10 dollar corkage fee. Good to remember that Total Wine is only a block away for a stop prior to coming here! Very busy night in the middle of restaurant week. We were seated in the patio which was a bit toasty in mid-September, but tolerable. Service was good, prompt but not overbearing.   I had the Stuffed Calamari appetizer, nicely baked so without the heft of frying. Delicious....my date had the pear salad and reported it was very good. Entrees were fantastic, my filet was perfectly seasoned, a perfect medium-rare. Exactly how prime beef should be! My companion's sea bass was equally delicious. Desserts were OK (I'm not much of a dessertophile, though). Berry tarte and chocolate-caramel Fleur-de-Sel.   If you want a nice romantic \"special events\" meal, this is a great choice (especially if you want to celebrate with a really fine bottle of wine). I'll make it back before too long."}
{"text":"2nd time we've dined here - love the ambiance, food and drinks. Unfortunately, 2 items were out so sync; 1. our service was spotty (we do like a leisurely pace) between courses and getting a question answered from the kitchen. 2. My partner ordered the pate yet received the Brie board - which she ate because she does like both...thankfully. My crab cakes were wonderful and the special halibut entree was good."}
{"text":"We decided to do a very belated make up anniversary, which was originally going to be at coup des tartes.  So I figured better late than never, this was my 2nd time and probably a few more for my wife at coup des tartes.    the Staff greeted us prompty and seated us right away.  I can never get over how small this place is.  it's like...  Let me show you to your table... 1 Mississippi, 2 Mississippi... and here we are  although they do seem to make the most of the space and it's not really an issue.  I love that this restaurant is BYOB, I ambitiously brought 2 bottles, we barely made it through the first.  We were a little disappointed to see that they'd taken the Filet Mignon Taco's app off of the menu.  instead I had a salad and my wife had soup which weren't bad.  For Dinner I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass, it was cooked perfectly served over a bed of sea beans in a coconut glaze.  it made a perfect subtle combination and I could eat that coconut glaze on anything.  My wife had Cordon Bleu which she allowed me to taste and from the bite I had it was very enjoyable as well.  For Dessert we had a four berry tarte, the tarte was very good with home made ice cream and fresh berry, served with a side of I believe Creme Fraiche.  All in all it was a good meal, and not a bad date night, and I will be back."}
{"text":"We had been wanting to try this restaurant for a while and never got around to it. We noticed it on the restaurant week list and decided we would see what they had to offer. The location is quaint and beautiful. The music was just a step above elevator music, but I get it; the crowd was mostly older in age. As someone who lived in Paris years ago, I had high hopes. Even as someone who dines frequently in Central Phoenix, I had high hopes. The dishes were okay. They reminded me of the \"good\" restaurants in small towns hitting all the normal bars with nothing memorable at all. To add insult to injury, before closing out the ~$150 bill, we heard them offer the people next to us the wine pairing for the Restaurant week menu. Why weren't we offered this? All of this aside, I must say I was distracted by the thick layer of dirt on the windowsill behind my date's head and the less than clean/polished silverwear in front of me. Let's just say I really wish Petit Maison in Scottsdale was still open. They never claimed to be so elegant, and their food was on point."}
{"text":"If you don't head out much for \"fancier\" style restaurants,  pass this place by. There are plenty of other places that your hard earned money could be spent. My torte was microwaved, my salad was on a warm plate, my filet was fine but didn't have a fresh taste. I don't know...hoped for more."}
{"text":"we joined our friends for dinner last week. the weather was gorgeous so we sat on the patio near the fireplace. we started with wine, moved on to charcuterie, salads, french onion soup, and then landed on entrees: duck, filet, lamb shank,and  short rib pasta. we wrapped up the meal with pumpkin cheesecake, chocolate bread pudding, and creme brûlée. our friends raved about this place beforehand and it did not disappoint; everything was absolutely delicious. the service was professional and genuine--our server even kept up with our inappropriate humor. all in all, such a great night. we'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is kind of a sad review. We went here for the first time because we had a Groupon to use and had read that Coup Des Tartes is closing its doors at the end of the month. Such a shame, as the food was very good and the decor/ambience were great. I hope that somewhere down the road, they can regroup and open again."}
{"text":"Updating my review after a horrible experience trying to utilize their private room, Rendevous, for a birthday dinner.  Their event coordinator dropped the ball with several huge miscommunications during the 4 weeks we were in touch, and then went MIA for a week and a half before the event.  In the 11th hour, three days before the event and ON my actual birthday, I had to pull the event when there was no way to find a mutually-agreed upon solution that would preserve the original intent of the evening.  I had to inform my 27 guests of the last-minute location change via e-mail after sending formal invitations weeks in advance.   The entire experience was a nightmare and having the owner yelling at me on my birthday was not the highlight of my week.  The most unprofessional and offensive experience I have ever had within the service industry."}
{"text":"Coup des Tartes gets two stars for two reasons:  1) The edifice itself is charming; quaint and a delightful setup to a romantic evening. 2) The wait staff is friendly, courteous, and takes time to answer questions.  The food, however, is not particularly well prepared; hence the two star rating.  It is unfortunate because if the meal had been outstanding, I would easily love this place.  Also, it is BYOB for wine.  Puh'lease.  Do NOT open a french restaurant and have an adequate supply of sylvaners, and bordeaux's, and the like on hand.    If you don't know much about food, it's easy to fall in love with this place.  If you care about the food more than the building it's served in, you will walk about disappointed."}
{"text":"Came for a work event at the Rendezvous Room so I'm already happy since I don't have to take expense into consideration.   We were served a 3 course meal during an educational powerpoint presentation.  They also had a great spread of cheeses, salami, and wine while guests arrived.  I really liked the salami, and any time you can demonstrate great seasoning with dried meats, I'm all for it.   By the time the food started, it was already ~8pm, so I devoured that first salad course. Coming from someone whose yelp tagline is \"what are these strange things you call vegetables,\" I think that's a supreme compliment. Nothing tasted raw (which is usually why I dislike veggies), and the sugared pecans really complemented the course well.   The entree is where I took a star off. I expected deliciousness from the filet, but it was just average.   Dessert was delectable though, as they served up a peach tart that blew me away.  I would go back for that in a heartbeat, and it didn't feel heavy at all even after eating for ~2 hours"}
{"text":"I went for a date night and I was super excited to try this spot out after hearing nothing but rave reviews. And boy were they right! I love french food and french inspired dishes so I was looking forward to it all day and it definitely did not disappoint!  The owner is friendly and incredibly pleasant! He gave us a tour of the space and showed us all the different romantic and cozy rooms in this \"house\" that serve as the dining room We couldn't wait to order food and I only wish I had a bigger stomach! The 3 Onion Tart is out of this world. The crust was so buttery and sweet and the onion cut through the flavor and made this dish so delicious and dynamic that I didn't want to share! We ordered the Coq Au Vin and the Lamb Special of the evening and left no trace behind because we made sure to enjoy every single savory bite! We can't wait to come back for the escargot - I hear it's the absolute best in town. If you're looking for a beautiful, romantic, delicious spot to eat with impeccable food and service - Coup Des Tartes is the place to go!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. It is quaint and quiet and the food is fabulous. We particularly like the BYOW (bring your own wine) because it adds that personal touch when you bring your favorite wine(s) for a special occasion. The menu changes seasonally and they always have a great selection. You never can go wrong with the brie plate or the onion tart. The desserts are all amazingly delicious as well. This is the perfect place for a romantic date with someone special!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS, INTIMATE, AND PERFECT FOR A DATE  My husband and I went there for the first time on a Friday night to use a groupon.  Definitely recommend reservations, because we didn't have them and almost didn't get in. Fortunately a dust storm scared people off the patio, but cleared out when we got there, so the patio was wide open.  Food was amazing!!!  From our triple onion tarte appetizer, to the filet mignon and lamb shank, to the chocolate pecan tarte for dessert. We left totally satisfied, but wanting more.  It is a little pricey, $88 (before groupon discount) for 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert and coffee, but totally worth it.  We will definitely be back and recommend to everyone we know. Ambiance is great, loved the patio seating (so ask for courtyard if weather is good) service was excellent, and the flavors and food were perfect. A must try if you like french food. Looked like 2 fifties era houses that had been converted into restaurants, so the atmosphere was cozy but intimate."}
{"text":"We started off with the three onion tarte, which was really tasty and good.  The chicken cordon bleu was not great at all.  I am not sure what it was - maybe the mustard cream sauce, but I had enough after one bite.  It was really rich and the taste devoured my taste buds.  It was like drinking Robitussin and no matter what you ate after, nothing tasted good and you coudn't get the taste out.  The chicken linguni was okay and the sea salt dessert did not make me feel any better.  Good news is that the portions were pretty good, but this is a BYOB establishment.  7 bottles of our own beer cost $17 to drink at the establishment.  If it wasn't for the groupon we had, we would have easily spent over $100 for 2 people."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants!  The food has been, and continues to be rich, flavorful, and consistent. The new building manages to keep the familiar charm of the old site, but adds a new, modern flair. The addition of the bar is great for those wanting a drink after work, and the selection of cocktails and wine are perfectly paired to the sumptuous offerings.  The best part of the restaurant is the staff. Ron is always so courteous, and Andrea's attention and grace pale in comparison to her fashion sense. I've never seen a shirt with a seam running up the back worn in such a fierce fashion.  If you haven't eaten there, you're missing one of the greatest joys in life, ya dum dum. GO DO IT!"}
{"text":"The food was AMAZING... The service was mediocre. The hostess ruined our entire experience."}
{"text":"Unique, classy, quaint, best romantic outdoor patio bar with fireplace, awesome food and drinks! Excellent service! LOVE LOVE!"}
{"text":"I have not been here for a few years...but I have always enjoyed Coup Des Tartes.  I recently book a birthday party of  8 and we sat on the patio and man....what a night.  This place is really a \"romantic\" dinner place.  Fortunately, for us we pretty much had the patio to ourselves.  Our waitress Nicole and Andrea were fabulous.  We really lucked out on the whole evening.  This place is BYOB, so the we brought a great selection of champagne-celebration, wine and beer for our culinary experience.  Plus, I brought in a cake and at the end  and they made a great presentation.    Now for the food.  The food here is fabulous!  We ordered an array of appetizers ..onion tart was awesome. We each ordered something different and for maybe.......2 mins our party was silent.  The food here has always been consistent-delicious, decadent, fresh & the flavorful.     Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm really glad I went during Yelp Eats! This place is expensive. Even after the significant discounts, I was out $50. I have to say I was a little underwhelmed; I had very high expectations. Still there are great items on the menu.  I'm not sure why, but I'm a little put off by the BYOB idea, yeah that's right...the $50 did not include drinks (my friends and I brought our own)."}
{"text":"First and Foremost GO THERE NOW!!!! Can I give it 6 stars?  Every bite was PERFECTLY cooked and the flavor was Amazing!   Went with 2 friends, we had the pork tenderloin (moist, the cheese added flavor and a perfect combination of textures), Alaskan Halibut (Flakey, not fishy had shrimp and a relish on top that make it truly unique and wonderful) and Lamb Shank (favorable, not gamey well seasoned).  We started with the Brie plate, so good, couldn't stop eating it.  We ended with a chocolate tarte, usually the desert is always my favorite. Desert was good but couldn't out do the amazing meal we had.  The service was PERFECT, we went on a Friday night.  The owner was there and charmed the pants off of every guest. I can't think of a time I had better food or better service. I'm in love with this place!  I love risotto, the waitress brought out a side with our meal to try it. The risotto was so good and so well cooked and seasoned. How do they get everything so perfect?  Cost was 52.00 a person with tip included. I have spent way more per person and not had the food be this perfect.   Go go go go go!!!!"}
{"text":"I had an absolutely wonderful time at Coup Des Tartes, I would like to thank the chef and owner!  As usual I like to check out venues during the week without the crowds, so I met my good friend there and got seated promptly. I came especially for the lamb, which according to their little video is their \"Piece de la resistance\". Excellent it was indeed. It's hard to find French anymore I guess the food has gone out of vogue. I had a wonderful cheese plate for starters and their house soup, a minestrone thing since the classic onion soup wasn't on that night.  I sat in the main area which is a small converted house and I could see the lovely patio and the rendezvous banquet room next door which was used that night to celebrate an octogenarian's birthday.  Overall the place was lovely, charming and best of all French.  Oui Oui, Bon Apetite!"}
{"text":"Quaint restaurant with genuine staff.  The building itself was beautiful and recently renovated by the charming owner.  The beet salad was delicious (the goat cheese was on point). Desserts were also very nice."}
{"text":"OK, Sweet Pea and I love us some Coup, and it's not just because we've been coming here for years- since I lived across the street and could see the restaurant from my window- or because we got engaged here (which was incredible.)  It's because the food never disappoints.  You can go to restaurants and have varying experiences from the best meal of your life to terrible, but Coup is not the place for that.  It's consistent.  And consistent can be good, or bad. As consistently good as the food is, the service is likewise consistently slow (albeit friendly).  We went here for Valentine's day which we've been several times and I highly recommend.  It's romantic without being showy.  They have a special Valentine's Day set menu of 4 courses which is always interesting and good.  And, if you go on the day before Valentine's Day, they still have the menu, but it's cheaper.  Damn those greeting card \"holidays\".  The menu is also consistent.  The outstanding things are the brie brulee which is an absolute must-try as an appetizer, and the lamb shank.  Everything else is solidly good without being great.  The desserts are exceptional.  I like the BYOB aspect of the restaurant, although, they do charge you a lot for \"corking fees\", which amount to just charging you for nothing since they have a corkscrew sitting on the table and you are in charge of opening your own bottle. Coup, I love you.  You get 5 stars if you vary your menu a little, please, please, please get more vegetarian (if any vegetarian) options, and improve your service."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for some time as I had heard nothing but great things and thought it would be nice to take my mom out for restaurant week & they had a great menu.   I have to say the whole experience was strange, but my review is not about service - we liked our server.  He joked around with us and was light hearted.  It's about management and the chef, and I really hate leaving bad reviews but at the end of the day this was not handled properly.    First we came in greeted by a gentleman and then a blonde woman, mind you she still had sunglasses on top of her head at 6pm.  She came and started talking like we weren't standing there to the guy about wanting to put us at table \"blah\" but it was still seated so lets move them to table \"blah\" - then went on some weird ramble about the tables.  Mmkay... Come to find out she's a manager.   We were taken to our table and quickly greeted by our server with water. He talked to us about the restaurant and how it was a duplex, etc. Then we ordered.  First course came out, mom had the potato leek soup, and I the Brie Brulee.  The soup was delicious, but very thick and filling.  The brie was warm(ish) and came with bread crisps, grapes, and pears oh and one strawberry for color lol.  Nothing fancy and honestly was surprised by the presentation or lack there of.   So my mom ordered the steak.  She eats steak maybe twice a year- she's not a meat eater! When she does order steak she likes it like a dang hokey puck, well done no red, it freaks her out.  To me, a person who loves meat, this is just a crime - but to each their own right. We  joked with the waiter about this and all was good.  Out come the steaks ... mine was a perfect cut of filet. Very tender, juicy and flavorful.  It paired very well with the mushroom creme sauce and mashed potatoes.  The asparagus was burnt but I actually liked it. Now, when my mom cuts into hers she comes to realize she was given the end cut of meat with all the fat and gristle. This is the cut I give my dogs- no exaggeration.  It almost looked like cutlets that were attached by fat. Bottom line it wasn't a good cut of filet.  She got upset thinking the kitchen gave her the crappy cut because she's getting it well done so may as well give her the crap end cut if its going to be cooked to nothing. Now this may not have been the case but none the less she was upset and took it as an F-U from the kitchen/chef. Regardless of the situation, the piece was not good and shouldn't have left the kitchen.  We let our server know and then it just got awkward....  He obviously wanted to rectify the situation and make it \"right\" and asked what she wanted in replacement or what he could do, she said nothing she was just very unhappy and wouldn't be back. The exchange went on for a solid three minutes of \"let me fix this\" and \"no, thank you\" at this point I was getting uncomfortable. It just wouldn't end.   Then comes the manager - the previous blonde greeter (Helena)- over to try and fix it as well.    My mom just shut it down saying everything was fine nothing to fix she was just done.  I expressed she was upset by the cut of meat and again my mom said just don't worry about it.  The manager didn't really have any words she was like \"oh, um, okay are you sure.\"    We then sat there for a while waiting for my dessert ( I mean I still wanted it) as my mom decided to decline anything further.  I was happy with my food so I was obviously going to keep eating. They brought out TWO creme brulees.  For one, my mom ordered the pear and I the brulee.  She said she didn't want anything so they brought me two? Sadly, it went to waste, I can't stomach two desserts.  We then wait to get the check (10 min) and when we get the bill they took half off my moms portion- $20.  I have to say I was honestly surprised by this.  All she ate was a small cup of soup- she sent back the steak and didn't have dessert.  We honestly weren't expecting the bill to be changed but any restaurant I have ever worked or witnessed an issue like this - typically the manager presents the bill and that meal is taken off. Neither of which happened.   As we left \"Helena\" goes \"I hope whatever it is your dealing with gets better\" - I'm sorry, whatever we are dealing with??!?!   It took me a second to have that process and all I could do was laugh... is this person with her stupid sunglasses on top of her head at 8pm really ending it all with that comment.  What we dealt with was a bad experience, and crappy cut of meat.  Apologize, take it off the bill and take it as a learning lesson. Nothing was handled well.. at all... and now you are the reason I am writing this review.  She is a terrible manager/ hostess with not the mostess, whatever her role. She is rude.   I give it two stars because I did enjoy my meal and though the ambiance was nice."}
{"text":"Great place! We have 3 small children and for a \"fancy\" place they are very welcoming to families with small kids. Often times restaurants of this caliber frown on littles.   Great food, great for the family and great prices for this quality of delicious fare.   We will be back often.   Thanks Coup!"}
{"text":"really, I can't believe this place has received such high reviews from people.  my lady and i walked in, and were greeted rather rudely by a pretentious bitch at the front with a monotone \"name please?\", instead of a warm, friendly, french welcome to this rather charming looking place. we didn't have a reservation, which from the looks of how dead empty the place was, didn't seem like a problem. until the hostess whisked through her reservation list and explained she'd try to \"fit us in\". it was 6pm, the place had one other couple dining, and we were informed that the next party was arriving at 7:30. we weren't really looking to hang out. it would have be awfully lovely if yelpers would have informed of the need to MAKE RESERVATIONS before going in here, because if you don't, you're automatically a piece of shit according to the staff. sorry, i don't plan very much ahead. next time i will, and it won't be here.  anyways, after debating for a minute or two with herself, the hostess decided we could \"squeeze in\" and sat us right on top of the other couple inside the restaurant. she informed us that we could cork our own wine, for their low low price of 9 fucking dollars. in words only office space could adequately describe,\"coup des tartes, what is it exactly that you do?\".   the food was good, nothing spectacular for $25+ a plate. we got a salad with apples and nuts and bleu cheese, which was served warm. now this is the first warm salad i've had all of my life, and by no means am i some sort of wordly food expert, but i believe salad should be cold and crisp. not soggy and warm. yuck. the cordon bleu was tasty and filling, however, the wobbly table was an extreme annoyance when cutting through the chicken, but it was solved (with no thanks to the staff) by placing a jack-in-the-box gift card under the leg. i will admit, the mashed potatoes are some of the creamiest and best i've ever had. my lady got the pork tenderloin, which had a strange peppery-sweet pairing which i didn't particularly care for. we were broke for desert, so unfortunately we didn't get to try any tarts. you would think for a place that promotes itself as being so poise would get some fancier menus, other than a $.15 piece of cardstock copied in bulk at kinkos.  this place was rather disappointing. i honestly thought it would be way more comfy and welcoming inside but it really wasn't. it presents itself as being so high class and french and oh-la-la wee wee, but when it comes down to it, it's still located in a tiny shack of a house at 16th street and highland. maybe if it were located in the biltmore i'd give it a bit more cred."}
{"text":"Fancy little French inspired place! MAKE reservations! This place isn't too big, so it does not fit many. This new location has a nice garden area. They do serve according to the seasons, which is nice to have an adapting menu."}
{"text":"I've been to Coup Des Tartes twice now.  The inside of the restaurant is just as charming as everyone says.  I think the food is pretty good.  The onion tart is one of my favorite menu items.  I've had it both times I've gone.  I also love the BYOB option, and I think the $10 corking fee is pretty fair.    I have a huge problem with the price of the menu items.  $26 for pork tenderloin? And even though I like the onion tart...$12? I'd go back for the appetizers, but I don't think I'd be back if I had to spend close to $100 for the meal."}
{"text":"went here for restaurant week and the service was amazing. They took a little longer than normal to serve our food so they gave us free dessert and appetizer. The food was good and this place looked like a little cabin, giving it a nice homey feel."}
{"text":"The thing to remember with any restaurant that relocates is that they are basically a brand new restaurant, with all the little problems that naturally occur.  We went for Restaurant Week.   The escargot and the salad were very good as starters.  The french onion soup was just okay; it lacked depth of flavor and it was a bit on the small side re portion size.  The tenderloin and the lamb shank were excellent.  Unfortunately, the short rib bolognese papparedella was one of the most disappointing entrees I have ever experienced out; it arrived cold, but worst of all had no flavor or seasoning at all.   Regarding the desserts, the sponge carrot cake was the standout.  There is no espresso available yet, just coffee.  The new location is not as quaint as the original, but how could it be?  Tables seemed a bit set up more like a chain would...squeezed together.  I see a lot of potential with the new outside dining area.  The bar area is a nice touch; drinks were not cheap though, $17 for a small martini and a beer.  I miss when they were a BOB and you didn't have to pay $45 for a membership to be able to bring in your own wine; there is still a corkage fee.  Service was okay, pleasant enough, but had anyone checked in we could have mentioned the issues with the papparedella.   The owners seem to be really trying, they just have a new set up, kitchen, and staff."}
{"text":"We have dined here about a dozen times, and every time has been spectacular.  From the onion tart Hors d'oeuvres to Moroccan Lamb Shanks to the Berry tart, every thing here is fantastic.  Great wine selection, and a pretty decent happy hour as well.  When the weather is nice sitting outside by the fireplace is a special treat."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Coup Des Tartes a few days before my due date with our first child. The staff made us feel so comfortable and pampered that evening. I got tired before our entrees were served and the staff was kind enough to box up our meal and send it home with us. They even threw in desserts and ice cream. So kind! The experience was amazing. It's a beautiful restaurant with excellent service and amazing food. Thank you! We'll be back for a date night as soon as I am ready to leave the house. :)"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this restaurant. It is in a house setting, fits about 40 people tops. The staff is very welcoming and friendly. I ordered the salmon special and it was cooked to perfection! The Yukon mashed potatoes are probably the best I've ever had. You can byob but they charge a $10 cork fee. For 2 meals and the cork fee it turned out to be around $70, so not too bad! Very worth it. I will definitely be coming again for their summer menu!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for a surprise dinner last night and it was wonderful. Being able to BYOB is an amazing idea and more places should offer it. The food was absolutely wonderful, every bite was a treat. The prices are a little steep but way worth it in my mind. I loved that the tomatoes that were served with my meal were local and absolutely delicious. My bf wolfed them down and he normally hates veggies.   It's one of the many old houses turned restaurants near downtown and was very charming and the atmosphere was so comfortable. The ladies working there were delightful and helpful.  I'd definitely recommend it to anyone in the area or any visitors to the area."}
{"text":"Coup des Tartes, I love you.  I have nothing bad to say.  At all.  I love places like this.  Coup des Tartes is a little old house that has been renovated into a cozy quaint restaurant.  The original rooms and walls are still there and it is just so neat inside.  As some have posted, it can be a bit cramped at times but we don't mind, I love this place that much.  The menu changes seasonally as they use produce from McClendon's farms and you will find items that are in season.  We have had many items and what I like best is how the items are prepared, different than what you would expect with sauces, seasonings or preparations that I've never tried before and they are all amazing.  I love the escargot, my husband loves the stuffed calamari, we have had salmon, pork, filet... mashed potatoes, roasted potatoes, green beans, asparagus...  And so many delicious desserts.  They serve water in these cool rustic bottles and leave it at your table to pour yourself.  I love it, maybe I just love the cute bottles so much.  The cool thing about this place is you bring your own bottle of wine, and cork and pour yourself.  There is a corking fee, but that's normal for BYOB restaurants.  If you bring white wine or champagne, they will bring out an bucket with ice/water for you to keep your bottle chilled.  The owner runs his butt off and is there most nights and will always make you feel special.  The service is impeccable and the food is unbelievable.  One of my all time favorite places to eat in Phoenix.  We usually only go nowadays when there is a Groupon or it's Restaurant Week.  Just remember as with any Groupon, don't wait until the last minute to book your reservation or try to eat there.  You've got plenty of time so use them early and beat the crowd.  Not just here, anywhere."}
{"text":"Today is my birthday and I wanted to go some place romantic for dinner.  I googled \"most romantic restaurants phoenix\" and came up with a top ten list compiled by Softel.  I had already visited several of the restaurants on the list and was looking for something new, so I chose Coup des Tartes.  Coup des Tartes is situated in two yellow houses in downtown Phoenix, on 16th St between Camelback and Indian School.  It is only open for dinner from Weds thru Sat and required reservations in advance.  The place is small, cramped, crowded and loud.  I could see if it were empty and we had a room to ourselves that it would be romantic, but on a busy Saturday night, it just wasn't happening.  It also has a patio, which might prove to be less noisy, but alas due to rain, that was not an option.  We were seated in a back room, which was probably a former bedroom, in the back of the house with two other two tops and a four top.    Coup des Tartes is BYOB, which means they can only provide you with glasses and an opener.  You must provide the wine, open and pour it yourself, which is fine by me.  There is an $8 corkage charge, which is standard at most places.  We started with a carmelized onion tart served on a bed of red leafed lettuce, dressed with a apple vinegarette.  The tart was perfectly seasoned and the crust melted away in my mouth, being neither too crumbly nor too moist.  We followed with filet mignon, medium, served with cognac cream mushroom sauce, mashed potatoes and spinach.  The steak was prepared to perfect temperature, although not seasoned as perfectly as the tart.  The best part of the entree was the potatoes mashed, which were deliciously creamy.  Overall, I was unimpressed with the entree, it was somewhat uninspired and under-seasoned.  We finished with the B-52 mousse tart, which is a belgian chocolate mousse, flavored with orange, espresso and bailey's.  It was served in a marble crust and topped with whipped cream.  The mousse was most satisfying, but the tart shell was a bit on the tough side.  I wish it was easier to break apart so as to enjoy all parts of the dessert together.  Overall, I was unimpressed by Coup des Tartes.  The food was good, if uninspired, but not outstanding. I expected more in the way of presentation and attention to flavor detail, and overall this was a meal I could have made at home, blindfolded.  Try Cowboy Ciao or Atlas Bistro for something more exciting."}
{"text":"Amazing! Melt in you your mouth, simply amazing scallops!!!! I will be back here soon! And highly recommend this place to everyone!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is literally 2 miles from my house, I see it almost everyday. Well, finally after months of it teasing me, my boyfriend surprised me and took me here for my birthday last night. I absolutely loved it! I must admit, I'm a sucker for small, cozy restaurants. So that was an already added bonus.  We started the night off with Escargot, which I have never had. I gotta say, it's worth trying. Very unique...tasted unlike anything I've ever had. For our entrees I had the lamb and my boyfriend had the Lobster Risotto. My lamb was so tender! It came out nice and warm paired with couscous. Extremely flavorful! The lobster risotto was yummy too. Very cheesy. Risotto can be tough to make just right, but theirs was perfect.  We finished it off with their chocolate tart. Chocolate ganache topped with whipped cream and toasted hazelnuts, it was the perfect ending of a perfect evening. Service was great and the ambience was low-key and cozy. Definitely a great date spot.  Oh, this is a BYOB restaurant which unfortunately we did not know. The do charge a $9 uncorking fee, but it's cool to sip on your own wine during dinner.  Great spot. Expect to end up with about a $90 bill for 2 people though."}
{"text":"Maybe I set my expectations too high for Coup De Tartes. I expected to love it, I only liked it.   The boyfriend and I went there on a Friday night. I was in the mood for some amazing food in a romantic setting. I got good food in a kinda cramped, but cute setting with weird lighting.  We were placed in a back room where there were 4 tables. It was pretty cramped and with everyone talking it got pretty loud. The lighting was from a ceiling lamp with weird bulbs. Not real bright but not really dim enough to be romantic. I dunno, it felt weird.  We started with the brie brulee. It was good, not amazing but good. I was glad to have plenty of bread though - some places only give you a few pieces. The cheese to toast point ratio was great!  For our entrees I ordered the lobster with risotto and boyfriend got the steak with potatoes. For mine, the best part was the risotto. It was cheesy and flavorful and a nice compliment to the lobster. The asparagus was also done well. Boyfriend liked his steak but it wasn't the best he's had.  We skipped dessert. They only had fruit tarts and we were hoping for something more in the chocolate family.  Overall I liked it, I can't say the food was bad but I don't know if I'd rush back. For an $80-$100 dinner I can think of places I'd like to go more."}
{"text":"YAY for another adventure to Coup des Tartes!!!    Prior to arriving I mulled & mulled & mulled over the menu & when we got there, it was different, no worries, because indecisive me was able to...BAM!...decide!!! Woo!  As always the service is absolutely fabulously supreme!  Ordered chevre/tomate (it's becoming a staple along with onion tarte), I ordered salmon & the opposite ordered pork tenderloin.  My salmon was good & the sides were DELICIOUS (not the same as the online menu) BUT, why is it that for me, the opposite plate of food always tastes better?"}
{"text":"I took two friends to dinner for their birthdays. We wanted good food but a quiet location. This restaurant fulfilled our wishes. The food was excellent, the staff was very friendly and engaging and we enjoyed our conversation without yelling.   The restaurant is in a charming house that creates intimacy."}
{"text":"I can't even believe I'm giving CDT a 3 after all the raves I've read over the years. I'm a Phoenix Foodie living within a mile of the place, and now I know why my intuition told me to not rush.  I'm all for eating local, even more for local ingredients -- but the flavor at CDT was not spectacular. Competent, yes, but more on that below.  First, the service. Had a reservation. Waited in foyer for ten minutes for a host to show up at the desk. So did another couple. Nobody came by to say I'll be right with you. Not even the servers that passed through the space dared make eye contact. Wow.  Second, the menu. After looking it over, nothing really seemed to stand out as exceptionally prepared. We ordered the 3 onion tarte on the world's recommendation and it delivered. Chevre + tomato salad was fine. I'll come back next time I want the onion tarte.  Entrees were the Filet Mignon and Chicken. The only word I can conjure for these dishes is forgettable. Everything seemed kind of wet, and the chicken was not tender. The filet was not full of flavor. My husband appreciated the texture of the spinach being treated with care. The potatoes and vegetables were totally without character. They could have been from any other restaurant.  Our conversation in the parking lot went as follows:  \"I suppose if you don't know how to cook supper for yourself, that would have been a really satisfying meal.\" When I go out, I want to taste something I can't do myself.  Third, the dessert. Nine dollar tartes... really? After the two courses we ordered, plus the time we had to wait to get seated and between courses, we were ready to bail.  Fourth, the wine policy. I find it to be completely passive aggressive to charge an uncorking of $9 for pairing with such middle of the road food. So what if the fee is de rigeur? I'm probably the first to say it here, but the emperor has no clothes.  I'm happy to pay for great food and wine. Good thing there's plenty fresh talent in Uptown Phoenix to keep the next generation of diners entertained.  Sorry CDT, I expected more you delivered less.  I'm not your target market I guess?"}
{"text":"Leg of Lamb was fantastic! Everything that we ate was fantastic and the service was excellent. I don't think that you can go wrong with anything on the menu. Great place for a date or couples. It's a small and cozy place. I actually love the fact that I can bring my own bottle of wine to enjoy."}
{"text":"Matt took me here for my birthday- it was stellar.  The one down side is that they have no alcohol license so there was no wine on my birthday.  If we were aware of this we might have taken our own bottle and paid the high price of 18$ corkage fee (ridiculous since they don't serve alcohol).  Anyways, it wasn't a BIG deal for us since I am pregnant and couldn't have drank more than a sip anyways! Just be warned.  The filet was exceptional and the service was good also.  My steak was undercooked and they made it right without hesitation.   My husband had the lamb shank and it fell off the bone.  Great. We split the coconut/caramel tart for desert and it was tasty also.   Highly recommend this place. Small and quaint so you will definitely need a reservation!  It is in a old/converted house so it has a European feel.  Nice for special occasion or a date. Not a big group place due to their size."}
{"text":"Absolutely delightful. Charming, romantic & intimate...a little French countryside escape in the middle of the city!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for good food, service and an excellent atmosphere this is the place, you won't be disappointed. The place is so charming, great for a romantic dinner or to catch up with friends. You must have to try the ESCARGOT appetizer it's amazingly delicious, well everything is so good and of course don't forget desserts they're all amazing."}
{"text":"Loved it!!!  We went there last Friday night to be romantic and it definitely did the trick. I had never experienced a BYOB restaurant before and after experiencing it first hand I am hooked. We started the evening with the fillet Mignon tacos and they were fabulous, the perfect start. I had the chicken breast. It was stuffed with goodness and was served with squash, corn, and garlic mashed potatoes. A drizzle of pesto lined the outside of the dish and was the perfect accompaniment. My husband has the salmon as was very impressed (I don't do fish so I can't go into more detail). For dessert we had the four berry tarte, it was warm and the perfect end to a fabulous meal. They serve the type of food that continues to come up in conversation throughout the evening, in a good way."}
{"text":"I have to say I like any restaurant that is BYOB.  But to have a french restaurant that makes good food be BYOB?  I love this Place!  The portions tend to be larger than most french restaurants, so plan accordingly, make sure to save room for their wonderful desserts! (I love their lamb!)"}
{"text":"I was there a few months a go and it was ok. I hope rhetoric is not in play here. The atmosphere was good though."}
{"text":"Le Grande! My husband and I have come here several times, and every time we cannot wait to come back. Everything from the apps to desserts is impeccable. The charcuterie is perfection, as is the escargots. We have had nearly every entrée on the menu, from the filet to the salmon - none of them disappoint. The Coq au Vin is a particular favorite. The service is impeccable, the atmosphere is intimate and sophisticated, and at the same time cozy and unpretentious. One of our very favorite places in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This may be one of the most romantic restaurants in Phoenix, but there was nothing romantic about the way I devoured my food today at Coup Des Tartes, and I mean that in the nicest way possible.   I found Coup Des Tartes on a whim and decided it was the perfect spot for a girls lunch with some coworkers to just chill without the guys upon my return home. I was right on the money. The place is cozy and inviting and I love the house setting that just makes you want to let you guard down. Right near our table was a photo of a flower girl and ring bearer at a wedding, just like one you'd have hanging in the hallway at your house. Everything was beautiful, right down to the French limonade bottle used for our water at the table.   I can also honestly say pretty much all the food is good, well at least the appetizers and desserts... we shared a lot of items and never made it to a main course. Here are the items we had (prepare for a long list):  Soup of the Day (Roasted Red Pepper) Brie Brulee Chevre / Tomate Three Onion Tarte Latte with a shot of hazelnut Banana Brulee Chocolate Peanut Butter Tarte  I have to say that everything was truly decadent and I wanted to eat 50 more of them. The red pepper soup was the perfect starter and had just the right amount of flavor. The three onion tarte we split and downed within probably a minute or so!! This also came with a side of lettuce with a shallot vinaigrette for an added bonus (yum). I don't like tomatoes so I have to admit I didn't really have the main part of the chevre/tomate but the cheese and bread it was on was absolutely delicious. And the brie? Yum.... oh the beautiful brie. The carmelized apples on top..mmmmmmmmm an the fruits and bread with it really topped it all off perfectly.  Just when we thought we were all done, we were told about banana brulee and chocolate peanut butter tart. How delicious were both of them. On what we thought were full stomachs, we devoured them whole while I also enjoyed a latte with a shot of hazelnut. It came with a cube of raw sugar and was placed in the most simple yet adorable coffee cup and saucer.   In the end, the price was well worth it and the staff was amazing and kind. They gave us just the right amount of space and truly let us enjoy ourselves. The pounds my scale added to my weight afterward was well worth it. It just means salad and a run tonight :)  Thank you Coup Des Tartes. I'll definitely be back. I haven't had a chance to try lunch or dinner yet :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic and intimate. This is the perfect French restaurant. Beautiful and private inside and out, and the most beautiful and delicious food.  The escargot was the best I've had - perfectly cooked, not rubbery or chewy, with a unique garlic spice blend that was worthy of sopping up with the fresh bread."}
{"text":"Cute little place with amazing service and food. Parking is not fun because the lot is tiny. This restaurants looks like it used to be a house. Adorable. We had the brie brule with fruit for appetizer and it is to die for! Banana brulee for dessert was delicious too.  You are welcome and almost seems expected to bring your own wine because right when we were seated we were asked if we did.  I think my friend make reservations via opentable."}
{"text":"I felt really bad about leaving a 3-star rating because it is obvious that the restaurant owner is really trying to make a success of this restaurant, but there really are many areas of opportunity that need to be addressed.  Let's talk about the restaurant itself. When you run a business out of a converted house there are bound to be some aesthetic quirks. But the tables really are too close to each other. It's not cosy, it's intrusive. We were seated in one of the little rooms with a couple directly behind me and a couple directly behind my wife. We could hear every word of every conversation. There was also a 4-top in this room which thankfully sat empty as I don't think I could possibly endure listening to another conversation.  The server was very friendly, but missed a few social cues that a more experienced server would not have missed. My wife and I were trying to enjoy a quiet, romantic night out together. We had found a babysitter and were really looking forward to our date night. Unfortunately the server wanted to talk about the weather, about camping up north, about what our favourite cities in AZ were. It was too much. Right intentions, but poor execution. We overhead that he was normally a bartender and not a server, so maybe that was it. He was also at our table way too much. Between him and the owner visiting the table we hardly had a moment to ourselves.  I was a little disappointed by the depth of the wine list. I only saw one Cabernet on the list and that was a blend.However, the wines were priced well.  The food was also very reasonably priced. We started with the beet salad and the French Onion Soup. Both were excellent. I would go as far as saying it was probably the best FO Soup I have ever had. Entrees were a bit more of a miss than a hit. They had run out of the sea bass, so we had the halibut instead. It was dry. I ordered the filet with a shrimp on top. Both dishes were accompanied by overcooked asparagus and fried potatoes. My filet had a dollop of herb butter on top, which if served correctly will slowly melt over the steak imbibing its rich flavor to the meat below. Unfortunately the steak wasn't warm, the butter didn't melt and I was left with a glob that I had to scrape off the filet. It felt like the Chef had given up.  Dessert was good, but here I am three days later trying to remember what they were and I'm having a hard time. I think mine had popcorn on the plate?"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner....had dined here before; however, this time, we were fortunate enough to have a Groupon. I would dine there without it any day of the week. We love the byob...since that allows us to have a reallllly good bottle of wine ($9 corking fee - nice) with an excellent meal. Highly recommend it...best meal I've had out...probably since Binkley's and that's saying something!"}
{"text":"Attended a bridal shower. There was a limited menu for the event. The salad was fresh with strawberries and dried cranberries, a little too much vinergarett. The chocolate tart was delicious. The place is cozy and beautiful. I would return to try the regular menu."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a unique place to dine Coup Des Tartes is the place. This is my favorite place to lunch and tonight was the first time My friends and I enjoyed dinner. The food is impeccable, the rooms cozy and the wait staff a pleasure. I want to give a shout out to Derrick. He is engaging and knowledgeable about the menu items.  Ask to dine in the \"Parisian room\" (my name for it). It is where the Eiffel Tower resides! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Busy busy busy.. actually too busy.  We made reservations and were sat promptly. Very small but warm. Staff was nice. You can tell it was a full house but just incredibly understaffed.  Chow- After waiting an insane amount of time we ordered a cheese plate. Had a nice amount of cheeses and fruit. Nice start. I then ordered the lamb and my boyfriend ordered the pork. Mine looked like a piece of meat dropped in a bowl of Dinty's soup. Bleh. However, My boyfriend food was insanely Delicious. it had a raspberry chipolte glaze and goat cheese. Just melted in your mouth I was super jealous.  Service- took forever until we saw our server in between ordering and it was over 45 minutes after ordering before our food arrived. It was awful. We did bring our own bottle of wine but sitting there without food for 45 minutes its hard to just sit there with your wine staring in your face and not drink it because you want it to pair with your food.   Break it down - We did choose this restaurant as it is BYOB , so we could enjoy a very nice bottle without the inflated restaurant price of wine, however I will take a big twist of my arm to go here again, even though one dish was nice , the service was not up to the standard considering the price of the food. I much rather stay home and cook my own. Pretty let down."}
{"text":"One thing to say about this place...You MUST get the Meat & Potatoes appetizer.  Hands down one of the best appetizers I've ever had anywhere, and paired with a salad, I could contemplate just eating this for dinner.  This place is SUPER cute and \"romantic\".  They offer BYOB service which is great...you can bring your own favorite wine/beer!   The food was wonderful and the waitstaff seemed knowledgeable in what they were serving and made some good recommendations.   I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Coup Des Tartes is a particularly romantic place, although I've never been here with someone I had even the most remote romantic thoughts about. Isn't that funny? What's funnier is that I went here with some guy I married for our wedding night dinner! Ha-ha!*  The food is very delicious and the women that work here are uncontrollably adorable, always. It's a little dream of a house and takes you a bit out of the city when you're here.  *Back story: I married some Bulgarian so he could get citizenship. It didn't work out, so we are D-I-V-O-R-C-E-D. At the ripe young age of 24, too! My grandkids are going to have a field day with me."}
{"text":"It is not possible for me to LOVE this place more than I already do! I was taken here for a birthday and had the most wonderful time! Everything from ambiance, to service, to the food was AMAZING! The salad was light and flavorful and the tarte entree was divine! HIGHLY recommended!"}
{"text":"I travel extensively on an expense account and regularly dine in wonderful restaurants around the country.  Without a doubt, Coup Des Tartes is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix and among my favorite in the country.  First thing you should know is that it's a BYOB establishment so bring your favorite wine and they'll take care of the rest.  The menu is grounded in fundamental French cuisine, but they expand beyond it.  It changes with availability of local and nearby fare but a few items seem to always be on the menu.  My favorites are the three onion tarte appetizer, the Roquefort salad and the sea bass (with sea beans if they are available).  And while I am a chocolate lover, I have to admit that the three berry (and any seasonal) tarte is amazing.  Great atmosphere.  Excellent place to bring a date ... it's an old house with a relaxed, French country feel to it."}
{"text":"A delightful treat, a scrumptious country meal, reminiscent of a park picnic. These are just a few ways I would explain a meal at Coup Des Tartes. The starters of onion tart and pate were delicious, rustic and great to share. We ordered from the summer price fix meal and found it to a great value - filet and pomme frites with a great green salad for $25..It is BYOB which I loved but my espousa was put off by the $9 corkage fee, I thought is was the best deal going bt he thought it was   pricey...either way it is BYOB so bring something you love. The place is small so you will find it cozy and your fellow dinners will be close by...Enjoy, it is a great casual dining experience."}
{"text":"We just had lunch at Coupe Des Tartes! It was fabulous! Good was amazing and the owner very nice! It was great to have him come by our table and check on us and our dining experience! The restaurant is very quaint and beautiful outdoor area! Can't wait till it cools down to use the u door area!"}
{"text":"Coup d'état: a sudden attempt by a small group of people to take over the government (From merriam-webster.com).  Coup Des Tartes: a sudden attempt by a small group of people to take over your taste buds by serving you delicious food (From Karen W).  The actual restaurant is adorable, set in a renovated cottage style house with a few different rooms and a large patio with twinkling overhead lights. We were seated in the fireplace room which allowed for a more intimate setting.   The menu, as their website states, is \"French-inspiration American\" and is touted to be all-natural and organic, as well as locally sourced. The menu had a fairly diverse selection of items, from red meat, chicken, seafood, and pasta. I didn't see any vegetarian options aside from the salads and appetizers though.   We started with the French onion soup and three onion tarte. The French onion soup was superb, with its rich broth, soft caramelized onions, toasted bread, and melted cheese. I loved the layers of flavor and different combinations of textures. The three onion tart was a delicious combination of flaky and soft, buttery, savory and sweet textures and flavors.   For entrees we had the daily special: lamp chops with roasted vegetables and peach glaze, and the coq au vin. Both were excellent. The lamb chops had a slight crispy outer crust, were perfectly cooked on the inside, and had wonderful flavor. The coq au vin was exquisite. The chicken was so tender and the wine sauce was nuanced, with perfect seasoning and went well with the meat. It was served with tangy (buttermilk?) mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach.   Service was impeccable from our friendly waiter to our warm and welcoming hostess.   We were so full but didn't want to leave without dessert so we asked for the brown butter pear tart to go. It was packaged nicely, with the tart in one box and extra salted caramel sauce and creme Anglaise in another small box. It was a heavenly concoction, not too sweet, with a great balance of flavors.  Much thanks to Coup des Tartes for an exceptional meal. We'll be back for more delicious dishes!"}
{"text":"Loved this cute little French restaurant in Phoenix!  Amazing private rooms for parties and large groups. My brother and I had a nice late lunch with escargot, lobster rolls, and shrimp fettuccine with house made wide noodles!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for the first time after a symphony matinee last Saturday. We were very early (5PM). We sat at the bar and enjoyed some very creative and delicious cocktails. The bartender was very friendly and informative. We had the cheeseboard and enjoyed some amazing cheeses along with our cocktails. Finally decided to split a dinner so we ordered the Escargot followed by Risotto with shrimp. Both were excellent. We enjoyed the singer very much. This place has a terrific outside patio with fireplace as well as small rooms with tables all around what was a house before renovation. They also have a 65 seat meeting room and here is a little tip. Once a month they are doing mystery dinner theater. They had a great crowd for that this past Saturday. I can't wait to return for dinner at this great little establishment. FYI there is a $10.00 coupon for checking in on YELP!!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful dining experience.  My daughter and I dined here during Restaurant Week.  The service was exceptional, from the smiling friendly host that seated us to our wonderful attentive waitress Andrea.  The owner even visited our table to chat with us...nice touch.  We sat outside in the courtyard, with French music playing in the background. Andrea immediately came out and took our drink and dinner order. My daughter ordered the Escargot, Short Rib Pappardelle and Chocolate Flourless Cake.  I ordered the Brie Brulee, Salmon Grenobloise and Crème Brulee.  Every dish was outstanding.  My Salmon was one of the best I have ever tasted, cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious.  Andrea checked on us appropriately, but we never felt we were rushed.  I am already planning to return with my husband for Brunch!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best dining experience I've had while I've in AZ. We chose from the AZ Restaurant Week menu and were overwhelmingly pleased with all of our choices. I don't think you can go wrong here with the meal or the service. Me- Course 1: shrimp wrapped calamari, Course 2: Halibut with citrus- tarragon sauce, Course 3: Creme brûlée; Jim- Course 1: escargot (), Course 2: pork tenderloin with chipotle BBQ sauce, roasted sweet potatoes and slaw, Course 3: Key Lime Tart. Not one course was off. Order a bottle of wine or pay a small fee to bring your own for the year. Bookmark it!"}
{"text":"I took one of my friends to this restaurant when she visited from out of town.  As she describes her sense of fashion/home decor as \"ghetto nouveau-french,\"  I decided to treat her to a French-style dinner.  From the outside, Coup des Tartes definitely fits the \"ghetto\" theme.  Situated in an unassuming restaurant in a neighborhood that I wouldn't walk through at night, it doesn't look like much from the outside.  However, when you step inside, you feel like you've stepped into one of those tiny European cafes that are squeezed into a space that shouldn't be legal.  If you are claustrophobic, or if you don't want to hear the strangers at the next table chewing, then this is not the restaurant for you.  BUT~if you want delicious food in a cozy and warm atmosphere where you can hear the stranger next to you chew away, then this is definitely the restaurant for you!  To be honest, I visited this restaurant a couple of years ago, so I couldn't tell you 100% what I had to eat.  What i CAN say is that the food was delicious, and the atmosphere was quite romantic.  Of course, it was more or less wasted on us at the time since it was two girls, but it was quite nice for a girly night out as well!  They recommended that you make a reservation on the weekend, which I would also second, since seating is limited.  This is not a restaurant where you are in and out within an hour.    Pick up your own bottle(s) of wine (so you know what you're drinking, and don't have to think of overpriced bottles), slow down, and take your time."}
{"text":"I hate to do this after so many good reviews, but the service was not the best I've ever received.  I saw the great review in the \"Best of Phoenix,\" so I wanted to check it out on Friday night.  When we arrived, we were sat at a blank table (no linens, plates, silverware).  The host quickly brought all of that to the table.  He left... and it actually took 5 minutes for the server to even come to the table and ask what kind of water we wanted.  After delivering the water, she went to make several cappucinos and grab desserts from the back for another table.  This literally took about 13 minutes.  Not once did she explain that she was busy or that it would be a few minutes before she could get back with us.  I was on the verge of walking out, but decided to try the food.  The food is definitely worth the horrible service I received.  I might give it another try since our server may have been having a bad day... but, a restaurant has to maintain great service... otherwise, people won't want to give a second chance."}
{"text":"Went there for Arizona Restaurant week and discovered a gem!    Food was excellent, service great and ambiance charming.  The only negative is that it is located in an area that seems a little run down."}
{"text":"My fiancé took me to dinner here and we just ordered as much as we could eat. Everything was so delicious, right down to the desserts. The ambiance is so romantic, I love it. I hope he'll take me here again! It was one of the best dates ever!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  We loved the other place.  Now you have to \"join\" the wine club ($45 year) to BYOB.  The outdoors will be nice when it is cooler but indoors is a maze.  Many rooms with just 2 tables, and very closely spaced.  Better not hate your neighbors or you will be screwed! We had a room to ourselves but when it gets busy, I can see issues for sure.  The waitstaff is scattered, literally and figuratively.  The food was not nearly as interesting or flavorful as it used to be.  The thing that really set me off was dessert, the key lime pie right from the BOX AT TRADER JOE'S!!!!!!  Totally, I am not kidding!!!!  The nerve!  If you can't make a home made desert, please don't insult me with this one!"}
{"text":"We went here last Friday night because we had a Groupon. Called the night before to make a reservation, but when we got there they didn't have us on their list.  They sat us anyway, but since it was only 6 pm they weren't too busy. That aside, the experience was okay. The tables were crammed together and my husband and I could barely have a conversation without the people next to us hearing everything we were saying, and vice-versa.  Way too cramped for an intimate dinner. Like someone else posted, I had looked online at the menu and already knew what I wanted to order, so was very disappointed when a different menu was presented to me. I ended up ordering the duck, which was good with the cherry sauce. My husband got the pasta and added chicken, and it was delicious. For the price I would have expected more, or at least a table that wasn't touching our neighbor's."}
{"text":"If you want to celebrate for a special occasion, this would be a good choice.  Ask for one of the smaller rooms  Its so cazy and quaint.  The service was wonderful, as was the food.  Don't leave without the fruit tartes for dessert (mmmm) I could eat the crust alone!"}
{"text":"Great spot! Charming intimate dining rooms, creative craft cocktails and a menu sure to please. Went for drinks and appetizers: Escargot was amazing as was the champagne Pate. I'll be back often. So glad to stumble across this gem."}
{"text":"Came here for a murder mystery dinner which was so much fun! Everyone got to play a part and it's such a good vibe. I ordered a Cesar salad, chicken cordon blu with asparagus and a cheesecake. The chicken was so juicy and delicious. I ordered a drink that I wasn't too fond of because it had grapefruit but that was my own fault. Would definitely come back to try their food again outside of the murder mystery dinner."}
{"text":"A little too quiet for my taste. We could hear the other tables conversation so well we were forced to end up talking to them. Not many vegetarian options so we split two pastas. The risotto was amazing. The noodles with veggies... Was not good. I'm not that picky and couldn't tolerate it. I asked for no onions and she said they could try \"picking them out\" for me, which I thought was very odd. At that price, I would think everything was made to order, especially a simple pasta with veggies. It was a very intense onion flavor, luckily my date switched me. The pesto risotto was a 180 and totally wonderful."}
{"text":"First, keep this in mind, we just got back from Paris two days before visiting this place. Service was great and the drinks even better. Our waiter was very attentive and courteous. We started with the Escargot appetizer, which we were not impressed. We were expecting a parsley garlic butter sauce which is how it was served at every restaurant in Paris (if you want to be authentic) Snails were presented out of the shell. My wife had the steak tartare with a side of their frites (French fries), again not impressed. We were informed there were no quail eggs, or any eggs for that matter. Their was something off about the tartare maybe the pine nuts. I had the Moroccan Lamb shank which was pretty good. Meat was tender, sauce and flavors were well balanced. Overall not a bad experience. We would like to visit this place again, but maybe try something else next time."}
{"text":"Mark H., Nicole H., John B., and I threw around several options for the \"mother of all dinners\" and finally settled on Coup des Tartes because I wanted fish and everyone else wanted some meat except Mark, who is on a diet of grapefruit juice (a crossfit challenge). Ok, he really just needed small portions (the French are known for that, except not this French restaurant). Even the owner came to talk with us and mentioned that he is actually Italian and his wife is Hispanic, so no small portions at his restaurant, even if it is French.  I started with the Brie brûlée appetizer that was a gooey, yummy cheese. This was definitely not a small portion. So delicious!   My entree was the pistachio encrusted halibut on a bed a sea beans grizzled with crab (trust me--this is so good, but don't expect to see crab, just drizzle). I paired it with a glass of Italian bubbly because my party was having a bottle of red (couldn't do that to the halibut), and I like champagne.  I ended with the key lime tart, but not before tasting all the other desserts on the menu. My favorites were the four berry tart and definitely the key lime!  The whole experience was exceptional. I loved every minute of it!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today with a meetup group.  Everyone loved their meals.  Several had the lobster salad croissant (sandwich).  Some had the lamb sandwich which looked delicious!  I had the Blackened Salmon BLT which was also very good.  Service was a little slow, but maybe it was the size of the group or because French cuisine is supposed to be enjoyed.  The restaurant was very quaint and homey.  Loved the ladies restroom--be sure to check it out!  It's a bit pricey, so would only return for lunch."}
{"text":"To start with the good: the food was actually very good and I got try three different dishes and enjoyed all of them. The atmosphere good as well, small but adorable.   The bad: the service was some of the worst. I don't know if it was a busy day or if someone had called off but... no. It's hard to enjoy bottomless mimosas when you hardly see your waiter to bring you another one. The waiter (who we actually were told wasn't a waiter but rather the hostess) was very polite and clearly trying his best but made a mistake on basically every dish ordered. We were assigned an actual waiter at the beginning who we didn't see but maybe three times. I honestly wanted to love this place and had heard good things. I will give this place a second chance and update my review if things improve."}
{"text":"We went for a family celebration. Two days before, I had returned from a trip to France. I can tell you that the meal at Coup Des Tartes was better than most of the meals I had in Paris.  I had been warned that it was BYOB but I had forgotten. Take note! We ran up the street to Total Wine and grabbed a few good bottles.  The cheese plate starter was divine. Who doesn't love triple creams or humbolt fog. But it was also showered with delicious fruits and nuts.   The salad had that inexplicably light and flavorful touch that I have come to love of salad's in France.  I had the Arctic Char which was cooked to perfection. The steak and pork that was also had at the table were superb.  The staff was not overly knowledgeable but very warm and the service was good, not overbearing and not neglectful.   I have to say that I was still remarking the next day about the excellent quality of the food.   Its a perfect spot for a romantic dinner or celebration. Lovely atmosphere, delicious food and service with a smile. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"I'm a little torn about how to review this place.  We had a tasty meal but it was not without flaws.  First, the restaurant is really crammed in.  The tables are too small and they are all really close together.  I had to listen to everyone's conversation and bathe in the perfume of the table next to me.  The bread they serve is fresh and delicious.  The butter is blended with herbs and is so tasty that you will want to eat it all.  For the first course we ordered the Interesting Cheeses plate.  It was absolutely divine.  Four very different cheeses served with nuts, dried fruit and toasts.  We loved this plate.  For the second course we had salads - he the Citrus and Beet and me the Taleggio.  Minor hiccup here was that I ordered mine without onions and of course it came with.  The server did not check on us until this course was over, so I just ended up picking them out.  Other than that the salads were delicious - good fresh ingredients and not over dressed with salad dressing.  For the main course I had the Lobster and he the Filet.  My lobster was different - it was asparagus spears on the bottom, then risotto and then the lobster on top.  The asparagus and the lobster were cold and the risotto was warm.  I did appreciate that the lobster was not served as a butter delivery vehicle and was meant to stand on it's own.  The risotto had a lot of diced vegetables and fruit in it - which was new for me in this dish and I was pleasantly surprised at how well all the flavors came together.  Hubby enjoyed his filet.  He said the meat was cooked perfectly, but at first he found the sauce on it a little overpowering (the whole steak was dripping in it).  The mashed potatoes and spinach were great.  For this type of dining, we were both pleasantly surprised at the size of the portions.  We thought everything would be much smaller than it was.  We somehow still managed to order a dessert though - the Banana Brulee.  I'm not generally a big fan of banana desserts, but I would get this one again.  It was a chocolate cookie crumb tart shell filled with some divine pudding with banana slices on top.  The top was fired to create the hard shell on the brulee.  The flavors were delicious.  One last note about the restaurant, I really appreciated that the courses were appropriately timed, with a nice gap between each one.  It annoys me to no end when a restaurant brings one course before you have finished the previous one.  Overall, it was a pleasant experience, and one we may return to when our piggy bank is full again."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience for dinner, all around very unique and memorable evening!  Heard about it through Groupon and wanted to give it a try, pleasantly surprised about the little hidden gem in Phoenix.  Perfect date night atmosphere and delicious menu all around!  The service was very accommodating and friendly, and the food was so good."}
{"text":"Well, this is the 2nd time my fiance and I have been here. I must say, I'm disappointed.  We came during AZ Spring Restaurant week, so the menu was limited- we had the filet, the short ribs, cesar salad, tortilla soup, chocolate tarte, and berry tarte, ALL were excellently tasty! What I didn't like is their problem with gratuity. The first time we went here, they tagged on a 20% gratuity to the bill for no apparent reason- \"meh, maybe its their policy\". So, this time the restaurant week menu specifies that gratuity  will be added to the ticket- but the older folks next to us (mind you, the tables are VERY close together) ordered the EXACT same thing and their ticket was $15 less than ours. Disappointing- especially since the pregnant waitress in flip-flops took care of almost the entire dining room and paid very little attention to us. So, we're a bit disappointed by this discrepancy, and won't be returning. Too bad, the chocolate tarte was delish."}
{"text":"My First Date at Coup Des Tartes, I can't give this restaurant the fifth star because of a few drawbacks.  3.5 star review if I could  I have driven by the restaurant many times and thought Coup Des Tartes sounds like a French restaurant, great, there are not to many in the area.  Then I read the yelp reviews and thought this was a great place to take a date.  Its small, with a home dinning area atmosphere, and the staff seemed very nice.  The date went well so I have to give the restaurant a thank you for that. My date and I overstayed our visit and non of the employees minded another nice note.    Don't let the name lead you to think this restaurant is a French restaurant because it is not.  The definition of a French restaurant starts with French area ingredients and preparation.  Coup Des Tartes does not focus on  either.   Overall a nice place for a small restaurant atmosphere and quality food."}
{"text":"If you want to take your significant other out for a nice quaint getaway this is a good place to go.  Very pricey for what you get however.  It is BYOB with an outrageous corking fee IMHO.  Food was prepared very well. Was a little disapointed in the salad but the main course and dessert were spectacular.  The other issue was that we had a reservation and still had to wait about 30 minutes with no place to sit down."}
{"text":"I never go to BYOBs, but I gave this one a chance because of a friend's recommendation. The restaurant is in what looks like an old house that was converted. It has seating inside and outside, I was seated inside and enjoyed the decor. The service was good, but there weren't many people there, so it should have been.   For an app I had the brie and really liked how it was served. The brie itself was good, but it came with sliced pears and caramelized apples that were great. The bread was small pieces of toast and I would have liked a soft bread, but I still enjoyed it.   For my entree I had the duck, which was very tasty and it came with masted potatoes that were a great touch. I also tried the filet that was on a bed of creamy horseradish. I loved the horseradish, usually I don't care for it, but it went so well with the steak that I even tried it with the duck.   It is an expensive restaurant and I do not like that they charge a high corking fee for alcohol, but the food impressed me and it had a nice, romantic feel. I would go again, especially to try the lobster risotto on their menu."}
{"text":"Had dinner there.  The house was warm and cozy , a definite plus.  I ordered a French Martini and it was awful.  It either had too much cranberry or the vodka they use is cheap.  UV is what they use.  I sent it back and got a Lemon Drop with Ketel One.  Better.  I'm not going to belabor this review except to say I wasn't impressed with either the food, which was palatable or the service .  We didn't have desert.  No reason to believe it would be any better."}
{"text":"I came for Restaurant Week, and with gratuity, my husband and I spent over $100 for our prixe fixe dinner.  Sadly we simply weren't as impressed as I thought we would be.    The dining room was miniscule and overwhelmingly loud, the service was slightly slower than I'd expect (but gracious enough) and the entrees and desserts didn't impress us very much; mine being too salty and cold and his being too bland and cold.    I suspect some of these hitches were due to the high volume of other diners for Restaurant Week and the crowded layout of the old location, so I'll definitely be trying them again.  And I'm looking forward that second chance since their new location is about a block away from my house and I can literally walk there now."}
{"text":"Went last night and it was a great experience! We were sat by the owner who came and checked on us a couple of times throughout the evening which was nice. The food was amazing!! The three onion Brie appetizer was to die for!!! Oh so so good! Could have eaten like 5 of those.  Then we got the pork and the coconut risotto. Both were delicious but the risotto was my fave and it was so so delicious! Had the bread pudding...it's very chocolate-y which is not usually my favorite but thing in a bread pudding but this one was very good! If I had to nitpick about anything it would be to have then install dimmers, the lights were pretty bright for what is otherwise a romantic atmosphere. Overall fantastic experience!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quiet place to enjoy a romantic meal, this is a great place. This is not a kid-friendly place to eat , nor a place you want to bring a loud friend, as everyone in the room will be involved in the conversation. (We all have one of those loud friends - you know what I'm talking about!)  I love the attentive personal service - the owner was our server, and he was so nice! I gave it three stars because most of the food sounded better on the menu than it tasted,  but the cozy environment makes up for that a bit. If I were going to just sit there and not eat, I would have given the place four stars.  I was one of the friends that had lunch with Camille H. She covered the food well, so just read thru her review for food details."}
{"text":"What really blew me away was their service. We had the escargot and the French onion soup. Me and my mom didnt like them in particular and did not eat them. It could be a matter of preference. However, we got the duck a la orange and jose pasta. Those were delicious and we both enjoyed them very much. The creme brulee was also one of the best ive tried yet. What's best about this place is that they comped the dishes we didnt touch and let us use a coupon. All in all, I recommend them!"}
{"text":"We sat on their courtyard patio, brought our own wine, and had a classy but unpretentious dinner.  The roquefort salad was my fave--lots of tasty treasures in it--but the chicken cordon bleu ($23) was uninspired and a little overcooked.  We got the sea bass ($35) at our table and that was a definite winner.  Service was slightly inattentive and harried--I believe there was a party there that night and they seemed to be a little understaffed.  I think I'll try again for brunch sometime.  I have the feeling I got unlucky with my meal--people who got the risotto and lobster at the next table raved about it."}
{"text":"The best.  It is a historic house turned into a French Restaurant, perfect for weddings, parties, & events.  This has the best food for lunch which open tues-fri fr 11:00 am.  Dinner is after 5 .  Check out their website on line. Derek the server is amazing.  Place is NOT FOR KIDS, this is for Romantic Getaway, take PHOTOS"}
{"text":"great food and staff, especially the ham and real french cheese, love it and the  atmosphere."}
{"text":"Romantic restaurant for a special occassion is the definition of this place if you look it up on Webster's dictionary. The interior is very cute and you just feel special eating here. The service is top notch. The parking is convenient. The food is amazing. Started off with the brie and moved on to the steak. The steak was cooked to perfection. It was medium well but so tender that it melted in my mouth. The green beans were just the way I like it, crisp. Overall, we had a great experience."}
{"text":"From out of town. First time here since the new location. This WAS a classic Phoenix BYO restaurant with great food where you could have great food with your own favorite premier cru burgundy. Sill possible only with \"wine club membership\" of $45/yr (unfortunately inconvenient for out of towners). Biggest complaint- the wine menu! Chose a bottle of \"French burgundy Pinot noir \". Noticing the lack of domaine name on the menu, asked the waitress.  She just said see- it says there on the menu. Ok she wasn't the sommelier. The $54 bottle came to the table and it was Ropiteau - $9.99 at Total wine! 540% markup. Not a bad little $10 wine, but perhaps the cheapest red burgundy available in the US! When my wife complained, they did give he a free glass of a Monterey pinot which was sweet but passable ( I didn't want to look up what it retails for in wine stores!).   The food was ok but not what we remembered. The creme brûlée was wonderful but the lime pie and the chocolate soufflé were not memorable. The salmon tasted like cheap Safeway salmon, not particularly well prepared.  I liked the Moroccan lamb shank and the filet with mac and cheese was good. The escargots were disappointing (and I love well prepared escargot - why go to a French restaurant?).  This place used to have a special place in our hearts, but now I guess we'll not be back."}
{"text":"The food and service were good but this place is pricey. We love the moroccan flavor in the lamb shank. The pate is ok. I had better at Trader Joe. We thought the $10 cork fee was ridiculous. BYOB  restaurants in Chicago offer everything you need to enjoy your alcohol beverage at no cost."}
{"text":"Coup des Tarte delivers exactly what its name suggests, a ravishing blow to the palette that storms your mouth by force and takes no prisoners.  The chocolate and caramel fleur de sel tart is a testament to the aphrodisiac quality of fine food, and it had me moaning at the table heedless of surrounding company, who conveniently were also moaning with pleasure after sampling the four berry tart with vanilla gelato, so at least I was in good company.   The small converted house lends a homey, romantic feel with wood floors, soft curtained windows for natural light and warm walls that were decorated with a discerning eye for color.  The tables are small and a bit crowded, but are not close enough that you will end up distracted by surrounding conversation.  It is most assuredly not a place to bring a large group of people, with a count of four being about the max for a comfortably seated party.  One thing I adore is that it's BYOB, which is a blessing because their menu is pricey enough as it is without tacking on the inevitable, exorbitant price of alcohol.  Instead they charge a nine dollar corking fee and provide all the necessary accoutrement for opening and chilling your selection during the meal.   The appetizers are consistently delicious.  The three onion tart in particular is the perfect balance of sweet and smoky, with the tart crust and caramelized onions playing up the sweet side, and the smoky bacon with Gruyere cheese satisfying the savory.  It is an honest to goodness coup des tarte in your mouth, as has already been discussed.  The chevre cheese and tomato appetizer and country pate plate were also rich and savory, the walnut bread with the pate being particularly notable, although they lacked the complexity of the three onion tart and seemed much more savory.   The entrees were perhaps the weakest portion of the meal, which was surprising considering they're naturally the most expensive.  The duck breast was cooked to perfection and wasn't too fatty, and the honey, lavender, rhubarb sauce was a beautiful compliment to the meat.  The accompanying green beans and mashed potatoes fell far short of the duck though, and could have used a more creative interpretation.  The Moroccan lamb shank with Israeli couscous and chickpeas, however, was off the charts delicious!  It was fall of the bone tender and all the components of the meal were highly complimentary.  The sea bass I've had on previous visits also suffered the same fate as the duck, with an ultimately well prepared and scrumptious protein accompanied by lack luster sides.   But ultimately it is the dessert course that is the crowing jewel of this establishment. Don't say, \"Well I never order dessert.\" Or \"But I'm watching my weight.\"  Believe me, you want these perfectly prepared, sweet and salty concoctions to make love to your mouth.  Every tart I have ever tasted has elicited the same sleepy smiles of contentment and pleasurable moans.  In fact, it might even be a better investment to go a nontraditional route and just skip right from the appetizers to the dessert course.  That way you can order several varieties and indulge in blissful, sugary enjoyment."}
{"text":"Went for a birthday dinner, apart from having a reservation and having to wait for 20 minutes it was a great time.  Not really a french or foodie restaurant however their food and service was good... BYO is also nice change. The atmosphere is very cottage-like with tables close together, we had conversations with the tables on both sides of us.  The desserts were very good, at the time they had a pumpkin tarte that was delicious."}
{"text":"I love this place! The atmosphere is perfect. I think they did a great job with the space making each room intimate and charming. The service is outstanding and the food is amazing. They really do a fantastic job beginning to end creating a lovely dining experience that makes you feel special."}
{"text":"Went to eat here with some friends for restaurant week. Such a quaint little place with a beautiful atmosphere. Every course was delicious. From the escargot appetizer to the succulent scallop entree with it's accompanying mango risotto and finally the delectable pear tart dessert. Our server was very attentive and polite. Overall great experience. I will definitely be dining here again."}
{"text":"We meet here every week for my networking group. Ron the owner has an amazing banquet hall of us setup. Food is great, service is friendly. Also, I like to meet with my friends and clients at the bar for an IPA for which they have a great selection on tap. Location is great and easy to get to. They have accommodations for almost any event or party! Always recommend this restaraunt to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Ce restaurant est un peu Francois mais plus Americain. This restaurant is a little French but more American.  Yes, most of the food could be found in a French restaurant in France, but it could also be found in a creative American restaurant that is trying out a more eclectic menu.  Before I say more, I have to say that the whole meal experience was exquisite. From the initial reception to the final bite of dessert, everything ran smoothly with a very attentive waiter and the owner telling us about the restaurant week menu.  We started with cocktails, then an appetizer followed by an entree and desert. We paired three of our entrees with a bottle of Wildhaven Columbia Valley merlot while the fourth member of our group had a glass of prosecco to complement her halibut.  Each and every dish we tried, and we actually had twelve different dishes, was a succulent delightful taste extravaganza. Maybe I'm going a little over the top, but every bite was enjoyed by everyone.   I am just going to focus on my entree, the Moroccan lamb with couscous. The lamb was tender and savory with a hint of sweetness. The couscous was a perfect flavor complement. The vegetables were perfectly marinated with just the right taste. Definitely a five-star meal.  Do not expect to have a full meal without paying for it. This is not a $20 per person including drinks type of place. You should budget at least $60 per person if you want food and at least one drink. If you just have an entree, expect to pay $25 to $40 per dish.   This restaurant is worth every penny you spend here."}
{"text":"We ate here on a Wed night and the place was not so packed....parking was easy, the staff was friendly, and we were seated immediately.   The place is small, so you are eating in close proximity to other tables...but that's kool, especialy if u like listening to others complain about life and such.  I swear it makes me feel better sometimes ( i know, sounds selfish and insincere....o well).  My girilfriend had the roqefort 9spelling may be wrong) salad, which I tasted and will say it may have been the best salad I've eaten in quite some time.  I had the Muscles appetizer with extra bread for dipping.  Probably had a bit 2 much bread beacuse i was only able to finish half my chicken mushroom mashed potato and asparagus meal (lunch tomorow will be great).  Gabi order the Lobster  that came with a pineapple rissoto, which she says was also very good.  For dessert we had a light and fluffy warmed cheesecake with fruit and berries.  I thinki forgot to mention this is bring your own bottle.  Corkage fee applies but it is totaly resonable at 9bucks I believe.  Now that I have mentioned our meal (which I am quite pleased with) i will mention the ambiance.  This restaurant is, or rather was, a small house.  Low ceilings...small rooms...Certainly different than the typical brand spanking new establishments we see here in town so frequently.  Apparently COUP DeES TARTES has been around for 11 years now.  You gotta asume theyare doing things right if they are still in business.  Foos was great...Ambiance was romantic and quaint and the service from Claire and Mona could not have been better.  Both helped one another out and were quite gracious with reccomendations.  BTW, Mona is a Marisa Tomei look a like.    I will be back,,,,,2 appetizers, 2 entrees, dessert  and coffee for 100buks at this place was well worth it."}
{"text":"This is by far the Best Place for Restaurant week!   I started with the lobster pot pie with the most incredible homemade crust. Butternut Squash Risotto no words other than amazing! Finished yes I said finished with Crème brûlée Cheesecake with strawberries it was delicious.   The owner Ron checked on our table multiple times to make sure we were enjoying our dinner and to make sure we were well taken care of. Our waitress was very efficient, friendly and knowledgeable.   My new favorite restaurant in Phoenix."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! Love everything about this place, the environment is extremely charming, the back patio is very lovely and romantic. Our sever was very knowledgeable of the menu and the history of the restaurant which was very interesting! ...and the FOOD omg the food!!!!! Steak tartare, crab cakes and lobster oh my!!! I'm happy I finally got to visit here, not in love with the location but it adds to the charm of the atmosphere I suppose. Definitely a one of a kind restaurant, I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Thank you A for inviting me to dine at Coup Des Tartes.  I love that it was a BYOB place.  We were told that we only have 45 minutes to dine due to all tables were reserved. That means to eat quickly and dash out.   We seat in a little corner, but I can't help admiring the French elegant decor all around us.  We had ordered the Roquefort salad, mixed of organic greens, roasted apples, dried figs, toasted hazelnuts & Premier Cru Roquefort.  This was probably the best salad I had so far.  It was that GOOD!  We thought it was funny that they would have a dish named \"Jose Pasta\" at a French restaurant.  So we decided to give it a try.  It was linguine tossed in a chili garlic cream sauce with vegetables and parmigiano-reggiano. You can add chicken for $5 more.  The linguines were well cooked with light cream sauce and a little kick.  I think it's still missing something in the dish, but I'm not sure what.  It does go well with the wine.  According to the Waitress, the Chef had made the dish for himself one night, but the employees tried and liked, so now it's on the menu.  After the main course, we had ordered the Mocha Pecan Tarte.  It was a petite warm pecan tart with chocolate, Kahlua, and vanilla ice cream on the side.  This was not meant to be shared. Sorry, A! : )  Shortly after the dessert arrived, we didn't have much time to enjoy it.  We were told by one of the Waitresses that our time is almost up.  If you want to enjoy full French experience here make sure you have reservation."}
{"text":"We used a Groupon at Coup des Tartes last week. What a cute little place! We decided we were going to indulge and started with the three onion tarte (per recommendations in other yelp reviews) and their roasted red pepper soup. The onion tarte was rich and pretty much melted in your mouth. I'm not normally a crust person, but theirs was very good. I love roasted red peppers, but I'm not a huge fan of soup versions. My boyfriend liked the spiciness of it, to me it was okay.   We also ordered the arugla, artichoke, and tomato salad. This was also okay to me. I ate some, but decided it was more important to save room for our entrees. The entrees were impressive. We had the filet (very tender) and the lobster (great accompanying sauce).   We also ordered dessert (mainly based on several raving yelp reviews). My boyfriend had a banana dessert and I had the mixed berry tarte. I loved the berries, but overall the dessert was a little sweet for me.  Some hits, some almost misses, but overall I'm a fan."}
{"text":"This has been a place on my bucket list to check out and I was pleasantly surprised by a romantic date night here last Friday with my bf.  Service=amazing.  Atmosphere=Amazing.  Food=amazing  We had the sea bass and filet and can't give enough props for how great it was.  Even better the restaurant offered 20% off the bill if you donated at least $10 cash to a reputable charity.  One of the most charming places I've been too in a while and will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Came to Coupe Des Tartes during Restaurant Week. The whole experience was excellent. The Host and Owner escorted us to a table for four in a cozy room. The room was not noisy and was appreciated. After cocktails and a bottle of red wine We ordered the fabulous food. all four of us enjoyed the plates we ordered from appetizers to dessert. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"it was ok...it was not that impressive esp for the price that you pay.  the food was OK and the service was just ok."}
{"text":"I can't say enough positive things about our dining experience at Coup Des Tartes.  We were greeted with a friendly welcome and seated in a cozy room.  It is unique as it has multiple rooms and makes you feel like you are in the owners home.  The meal was exceptional.  I had the French onion soup that was delicious and we both had the Duck L'orange and it was incredible.  It made our tummies smile.  The deserts were also wonderful.  The service was warm, friendly and very attentive to our needs.  The owner then came around and thanked us for coming.  This restaurant will exceed your dining expectations 100%.  I highly encourage you to run don't walk to Coup Des Tartes in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch last week with some friends to celebrate my belated birthday. We were disappointed Cafe Monarch was closed for the summer and we were looking for somewhere that was BYO because we were hauling around our wine. Viola! Coup de Tartes!   We all share so we can try a bit of everything (we do this pretty much everywhere) and we started with the goat cheese on toast and the onion tart. Both came with salads that were nicely dressed in vinaigrette's. Both appetizers were good, though the onion tart outshined the goat cheese. The tart was creamy, oniony and delicious. Everything we could hope for. Everyone enjoyed it. The goat on toast was exactly that:  Cheese on toast. It tasted good because I like goat cheese so much and it reminded me I needed to pick more up at the grocery store, but it really was nothing exciting. In fact, it's getting by far too much face time now.   For the entree we kept it light to save plenty of room for dessert. We shared the seafood salad and the ham and brie sandwich. The sandwich was just ham and brie on an average baguette. Like something you'd pick up at Safeway. The baguettes at Lee's Sandwiches are much better and the ham on the sandwich was the processed stuck-together loaf kind (like the Oscar Meyer packaged type). I've had by far better ham and brie sandwiches for two euros in the metro stations in France. Granted, that was in France but you get my drift. Clearly, we should have gone with the lamb sandwich. The salad was loaded with seafood and the dressing was fine but it didn't make me want to lick my plate and that's what I was looking for. Enough said.   Next course, dessert. We ordered their seasonal tart, the smores, the \"famous\" bananas foster brulee and the one I was looking most forward to, the dark chocolate salted caramel. First the salted caramel tart.. I had a fellow dark chocolate salted caramel lover at the table so we both dug right in and we were equally disappointed. It miraculously tasted nothing like chocolate, caramel or salt. Just sweet goo. I don't think we even finished it. The banana brulee tart was good, though not as good as I remembered it. The hi-light of dessert, surprisingly, was the smores. I was a little jaded because it came with milk chocolate (I'm a die hard dark chocolate lover and you know what they say, one you go... nevermind) but damn, that thing was good. A little graham cracker crust filled with creamy milk chocolate and topped with a toasted marshmallow. That plate deserved to get licked!   I had been here once before a few years ago for dinner and I was disappointed that the lunch menu only had sandwiches and salads on it. I understand the need to keep it simple and quick, but not even a single entree? Nothing was bad but aside from the onion tart and the smores tart, nothing was a standout. I was just a little disappointed."}
{"text":"Shane decided to surprise me and made reservations for Coup Des Tartes for our Valentines Day dinner.  This venue is very charming and romantic.  It is always nice to get a little dressed up to eat some AWESOME food.  Our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable.  She let us know that all of their foods are grown locally and organically.  I am a huge fan of supporting local organically grown producers.  I got a real at home vibe and could tell that they have a lot of regulars.  We both ordered cheese appetizers, which we could have had one and shared.  I had the Brie spread which was very soft and flavorful, especially matched with the pears.  Shane decided to try the  sampler of different cheese and for the most part was equally as good as the Brie plate.  I decided on the salmon with butternut squash and pumpkin seed risotto.  This was hands down the best match in flavors.  The salmon was very mild in flavor; however, mixed with a little risotto was very warm and flavorful, this dish would be a fall classic.  Shane decided on the fillet which looked great and was gone in 60 seconds.  This venue would be great to take a date or bring good friends to share a bottle of wine.  BTW you can bring your own wine with you and they only charge you a small corking fee."}
{"text":"I met S & T here for lunch. S suggested it. Do you read the reviews on Yelp? Do you just look at the star ratings and go from there? As I type this there are 5 reviews to the right of this text box and all 5 of them are 5 Stars. Wow. It's impressive at first and I must say a bit uncomfortable. They're all Elite Yelpers. Ooooooo, impressive. Between the 5 of them they have over 7100 reviews. That's crazy isn't it? Just to review, here are some of the highlights of those reviews vs our experience; Our server was just the right amount of attentive and sweet. Hmm, ours wasn't. Ours was nice enough, but she seemed tired, overworked (seemed to be the only one there) and as for attentiveness, not really. The space is beautiful, charming and shabby chick. I'm not sure if they were describing the current location or the one before the move. The current location is an old house. There is a very large patio which would have been the old back yard. The patio is surrounded by the parking lot. We were there during lunch, 110'+ degrees outside. The patio was effectively closed. I think they were still building it or doing some sort of renovation to it. It will be very nice when open though. The inside is pretty much how one might imagine the inside of an old Phoenix house to be. The rooms are made up into small individual dining rooms. Now, if the square footage of your house starts with the number 3,4,5 or above, and you don't live in a \"tiny house\", skip to the next paragraph. Close your eyes. Imagine one of your bedrooms, not the master though. Imagine the room empty and now, imagine it with 4 tables in it. Some round, some square, some rectangle. Chairs around them, maybe 10 total. Does the room feel cozy and quaint? Maybe crowded and full. The room we were in was a bit full. We heard the conversation from of 4 ladies at one table and from the 2 ladies at another. Both those tables drowned out the other 2 people in the room. I'm not sure how the other rooms are situated but I would assume, similarly. Now I have to preface this next bit by saying that we were there for lunch. I think they just started the whole lunch thing a short time ago so it's a bit of a new thing. All of the 5 reviews I've mentioned above were for dinner. All of the 5 reviewers raved about the food.  Here are some of the adjectives used: superb, delicious, excellent & exquisite. So like I said, do you read the reviews or just the number of stars? If you only check out the stars, it's like eating ribs with a knife and fork. You miss a lot. Our food, aside from the French Onion soup ($10) that S had, which he said was very good, was fine but none of it would qualify for any of the adjectives mentioned above.  S & I both had the Prosciutto Sandwich ($12). Thinly sliced prosciutto with house made fig jam, pesto, mozzarella and arugula placed in a decent baguette. Worth $12? No. Head over to Postino and order the Bruschetta board with only the Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone. Yes, it will cost you $2.50 more but it will be much better. T got the Croque Monsieur ($12). Swiss cheese, ham, mornay sauce. He enjoyed his sandwich. Did any of us say we wanted to come back again next week, next month or really anytime? No.  Slow service. Good Food. Fair prices. Loud atmosphere. 3.5 Stars."}
{"text":"We had our holiday party here and boy I have been wanting to return. The beef tenderloin sandwich was so delicious. What really made this sandwich stand out was the caramelized onions. They where sweet and savory! I also ordered the raspberry studded brown butter tarte. It was amazing! I cannot wait to return and try their dinner menu or perhaps get the hubby to come here for the NYE dinner pre-fix menu."}
{"text":"Coupe Des tartes has a great atmosphere very charming and romantic food was very tatsy and service was friendly, I had the filet it has a special spice kick to it and the yukon mashed potatoes were very good , The Brie Brulee is a must soooo yummy my favorite part of the meal!!!!!!!!!! oH IT'S BYOB kinda of a cool thing. I will be back ."}
{"text":"We went for the Valentines Day dinner.  It was cute, really nice and more food in one sitting than I have had in a long time.  It was pricey but worth it in my eyes.  We brought our own wine we purchased in Sonoma and were saving for a special night.  Service was wonderful.  The ambiance is romantic and sweet.  The brie was so good, I could have just eaten the entire plate and been completely satisfied but of course, I had soup, the main dish, dessert and wine.    Great place for a romantic date."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE Coup De Tartes!  I meet here every week with my Networking group and each week they give us amazing service and we get to try a different meal every time.  My favorite is the Vegetable Lasagna... Can I say YUMMY!!!  They have never disappointed any of us on their food choices!  I would recommend CDT to Everyone.  Whether a small lunch meeting or a romantic dinner with your loved one, Coup Des Tartes is the place to be!"}
{"text":"I've been to Coup Des Tartes several times over the years, including a great time on New Year's Eve back when they first opened. For a time they used to serve an excellent brunch on the weekends (Hangover cure #9 was my favorite) but that was short lived and deeply missed.  One thing to keep in mind when planning to eat her is that the menu is always changing with th seasons. It is also not traditional French cuisine, but French influenced takes on whatever fresh ingredients are available at the time.   Some of my favorite dishes in the past have included an excellent spinach salad with wasabi dressing, a Pork Tenderloin that was tender enough to cut with the edge of my fork, and the often reviewed lobster.  But the thing that keeps me coming back is the desserts. The tartes here are made fresh every day in the morning, and AMAZING. The Banana Brulee tarte is by far one of my favorites; with the filling texture soft and creamy but not overly sweet. The crust has always been light, flaky and a perfect contrast to the filling.  This is a great romantic place to go, small but not crowded and lit nicely. I do recommend a reservation unless you are stopping by for just dessert after a dinner elsewhere, as it can be very busy with only approx. 15 tables maximum. The staff has always been very nice, and they were even kind enough to create a custom menu for friends of mine that were engaged there (he hid the proposal in the words of the menu)."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Coup since they moved locations, but recently brought my book club here for brunch. The new location is super cute....possibly even better than the old location while maintaining the same vibe. Our group was seated in a private little room with a large table. Our service was.....ok. our waiter wasn't the most knowledgeable about the menu and needed to check on things many times (but hey, I'd rather he check than just say idk or make something up). They also happened to be out of many items the day we came (weird since we came close to opening and had a reservation so they knew they'd be having a large party but whatever). Anyway, I had their savory crepe which was filled with chicken and covered in some kind of amazingly delicious sauce served with a lovely salad on the side. The prices are a bit high, but the food was good and the portion was a decent size. My main complaint is that their menu isn't friendly for vegans or people with egg allergies, which left some of our group ordering dry toast (pretty sad to go to brunch and only be able to eat bread). Regardless, I would return for brunch on a special occasion."}
{"text":"The BF and I went here last night for dinner because we had a Groupon. The place is very cute, small, but in a cozy way. After being seated, we were brought some delicious olive bread with herb butter....seriously yummy stuff. As we looked over the menu we were a little disappointed that it had changed and had not been updated on their website (we both kind of picked out what we wanted before even getting there...what?...we were excited!). I was originally going to get the filet because it sounded good on their online menu and came with risotto (which I love), but the new menu had it with roasted potatoes (which I thought sounded really boring) so I decided not to get it. The BF was going to get the herb encrusted chicken or pork, but instead got the chicken cordon bleu (since they no longer have the pork or the other chicken). The menu changes weren't really that big a deal, at least that means the restaurant is keeping it fresh.  My real problem with the ordering process was our waitress. She really rubbed me the wrong way. She seemed like she did not want to be working. Additionally, she was not knowledgeable about the menu and had clearly not tasted anything. For example, I asked her opinion between the filet and the duck and she said 'well, it depends on if you like steak or duck.' Well....ya. Clearly it depends on that...but if I like both....maybe give me more explanation about each dish??? I honestly don't think she knew much about it, and that was the problem. She probably should have tasted the dishes.  Anyway, I went with the duck and it was just ok. The fat was rendered from the skin, but the skin was soggy and chewy...not crunchy at all. The cherry sauce was good (I like how it had whole cherries in it), as were the mashed potatoes (very buttery). The harit coverts were good, but a bit crunchier than the BF liked. His chicken was good (in my opinion) but he wasn't a fan of the sauce, which was a dijon mustard sauce. He said he felt like he was eating a fancy deli sandwich....which I guess I can see. So, needless to say, dinner was a little underwhelming.   We still definitely wanted to get dessert, however, so we pressed on. Their fruit tartes of the night were cherry vodka and peach. I asked which was the better choice (I still had a little hope that she might be useful), and she said 'well it depends on if you like cherries or peaches.' Seriously??! You are killing me! She just sounded so bored and unenthusiastic. I don't care if she really has a preference, make one up! If they are equally good, just pick one! Or at least express some ounce of enthusiasm for the dessert as a whole! Clearly we need guidance! I asked some follow up questions and finally got her to tell me that the cherries just came back into season, so we went with cherry. Thank you! It was like pulling teeth. I feel like if your restaurant is charging more than 20$/plate you should have more professional wait staff. So, when our tarte came out, our 'waitress' was busy, so a different waitress (long curly brown hair) brought it over and said 'Oh, this tarte is my favorite! It is so good, you are going to love it!' or something to that effect. And even came back to check on us to see if we liked it. That was awesome! She clearly has tried the food and has some passion for it. Why couldn't we have been in her section?Anyway, she was right...the tarte was incredible! It was sweet and savory, the cherries were fresh, the crust was almost like shortbread and the little cookie on top was cute. The ratio of filling to crust was spot on.   Overall impression: I would not come back here for dinner, I think for the prices the food is subpar. (also, I overheard the table next to us ask where their lobster was from and the waitress went to ask the chef and came back and told them he didn't know...somewhere in Canada. I think for their prices they should know exactly where their food is coming from...just my opinion). I would, however, come back for dessert (and maybe to try their onion tarte). Clearly, the specialty is the delicious tartes, so I would come back and have dessert and coffee and be a happy lady."}
{"text":"Situation: Wedding Anniversary App: Brie Brulee Salad: Roquefort Me: Lamb Shank Wife: Sea Bass Outcome: So few times have I ever run into a place where the food is so good, it puts pictures in your mind.  Having a transcendental experience while eating is the reason why restaurants like this exist.  Sure the place cost a little more, but so do really good seats at a show.  And this place delivers.  The Lamb Shank melted away into a dark, rich glaze over vegetables and pearl cous cous. Immediately images of a dark hunting lodge and snow drifted evenings filled my mind.  I was immediately dashed back to my table the moment my wife's sea bass arrived. Smells of roasted coconut and curry wafted up and as I snuck a bite, the rush of flavor sent me straight to the coast on a summery day.  The mixture of sweet and bright flavors over the sea beans and crusted with pecans was the reason I will return to this place.    Let us not forget that the beauty of this place is that it is also BYOB, so pull the best bottle you have and stroll over to this place."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Owner was really friendly and nice! Food was amazing!!! Atmosphere is amazing!! Nice hidden gem in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Being a lovely day out, we had to sit on the patio. It was perfect.   I started off with the Onion Tarte, which was much more delicious than I was expecting, and I had high expectations going into it. It had so much character without the onion playing an overbearing role. The bacon complimented it perfectly, then again I'm a sucker for bacon. I highly recommend the dish. The filet mignon was cooked to perfection, as always. The Four Berries Tarte was perfect, it wasn't overly sweet and left me with the most satisfying smile."}
{"text":"Wonderful hidden gem tucked in a extremely secluded old home in Central Phoenix.  Service was fantastic and the food was even better!  We had the leg of lamb and the lamb was cooked perfectly.  For desert we had a berry tart and it was to die for.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a rather nice French restaurant in Phoenix.  Went there two days ago.    The onion tarte is very good The chevre tomat is also good  The rack of lamb on the bed of couscous is good The salmon and Greek yoghurt is good  This is definitely a good French restaurant in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Had to update our review with some pictures from our most recent visit.  We have never had a bad experience here.  Seriously, everything we have ever ordered has been fantastic.  Lunch, dinner or Sunday brunch.  Tonight was date night with my wife and we had the fillet and sea bass.  Sat at the bar this time.  Derrick was wonderful.  Had excellent suggestions and explained the menu.  Great conversation and ambiance as always.  We always love our visits to Coup Des Tarts."}
{"text":"Very terrible food, it came out cold and the pasta was overly spicy and had a weird taste. They did have good desert and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Went for lunch.  Very nice atmosphere.  Food is delicious.  Much better than anything downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is really a hidden jem.  They excel at proving excellent service, a very welcoming feeling, excellent drinks and fantastic food.  Started off my meal with a taquila cocktail at the bar, which was very unique and expertly prepared.  Had the onion soup which was excellent, though very mild which will appeal to some more than others.  Also, had a chance to try the sea bass.  The pistachio coating provided a unique sweet flavor that was perfect with the light flavored fish.  They also have an interesting wine club system where they allow you to bring your own wine if you join the club.  Great way to make this a BYOB place for a reasonable cost."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews, I have to say I was not all that impressed. I am from NYC and lived in Los Angeles, so I am always looking for real food experiences here in Phx. This fell short. The positives: Servers were attentive Dining room was clean The onion tart was great- but NOT worth $12! The negatives: Mediocre lunch menu Moroccan lamb sandwich - other than the chutney and the natural gaminess of the lamb, the sandwich had no flavor.  Pomme frites- overdone potato wedges I can make at home Onion tart- as stated above, not at all worth $12 for a slice of quiche. $6, maybe $7. But $12?!! The crust was too sweet.  My friends had the ham and Brie, sliders, and salmon tacos. All were mediocre tasting and unimpressive. Shocking that all are so expensive. Lemon tart dessert- gross. Pale custard looked like vomit in a small crust. Again flavor was not impressive.  So perhaps this place is great for dinner, and I may come back to try that- but for lunch, no way."}
{"text":"So... my parents found $500 of traveler's checks in my old room back in Washington State that apparently we took out for some international trip and never used.  The agreement was that they'd give the checks back but we had to take them out for a super fancy dinner as a finder's fee.  They did a lot of research into restaurants in the area and chose Coup Des Tartes.  This was an incredible experience but we do need to caution that it doesn't come cheap.  We spent $310 on four people, but we also were absurd and went absolutely crazy for the night.  We're pretty sure that everyone else in the restaurant was celebrating some type of event.  This would be a great place for a proposal (especially if you're following it up with a honeymoon in France) or for a formal pre-wedding dinner.  The location itself is gorgeous - an old brick house with a nice outdoor courtyard and individual rooms to make your dinner feel more private and exclusive.  Service was great - the owner came by multiple times to check on us, and our server was a very nice friendly young man.  My parents were joking around that the server was out of place in a French restaurant - there was no traditional condescending sneer at all.  ;)  We started with cocktails.  I had the European, which our server recommended and I loved.  We also had an absolutely incredible Wildhaven Columbia Valley merlot which was probably the best merlot I've ever had.  I think we paid about $45 for the bottle (it looks like it usually runs about $13 in stores) but the wine really did taste more like a $50 bottle.  We're actually going to head to Total Wine and buy some right now.  Anyway, this review is supposed to be about Coup Des Tartes, not Wildhaven wine...  I had some of the French Onion Soup (great slightly-smoky aftertaste) and the Brie Brulee, which is pretty much a huge delicious chunk of baked brie with baked pears on top and some fresh fruit on the side.  Portions here are HUGE.  You usually go to a French restaurant and expect tiny portions, but the owner's Italian and the portion size shows.  You definitely get your money's worth.  For the main course, I chose the duck and also sampled the halibut (which is served on top of a bed of sea greens), the crab-stuffed pork, and the lamp leg.  My favorite was actually the lamb (fall-apart-in-your-mouth and juicy), but all of the options were excellent with complex flavors.  We then decided to be even more absurd and ended up eating every dessert on the menu... the Key Lime Pie, Berry Tart, Creme Brulee, Girlscout Cookie, and Upside-down Pear Cake.  I'm actually not sure if those are the real names.  I skipped breakfast the next day since I was STILL full from the night before.    5/5 experience for an absurdly fun night out.  This is not your normal \"hey, let's go get dinner somewhere\" type of place unless you're a millionaire, but it's a blast for special occasions."}
{"text":"Good lord, i honestly can't imagine anyone giving this place less than 5 stars. I would have given 6 if yelp let me.  Where do I start? I've been here two times and haven't had the same appetizer, salad, entree, or desert twice. Coup des Tartes is batting 1000 across the board.  First of all, the prices are very reasonable for what you are getting. This is first class, gourmet French cuisine where the salads run $10-15 and the entrees $25-50 (for the filet mignon).  I agree, the corkage fee does seem a little incongruous ($10 per bottle), but whatever. You are still paying less than you would trying to buy a bottle from a restaurant (assuming your wine costs more than $10 at Bev Mo).  The service was crisp and well paced. The staff is attentive and friendly. The food is completely, and I mean /completely/ beyond reproach. This is by far the finest and most intimate dining experience I've had in Phoenix thus far and would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who appreciates excellent food.  By the way, when the menu claims they have the best salmon you'll ever taste, it's not hyperbole."}
{"text":"First off, two huge reasons to come here: ambience and staff/service, equally.  Food is delicious, great wine selections, unique and tasty looking cocktails (I'm getting the Coup 75 next time--muddled blueberries and blackberries? with gin, champagne, lemon...), decent coffee but sadly no espresso machine? (at least my friend said there wasn't), which surprises me in a French/high-end establishment as this.  I came for Arizona Restaurant Week so I didn't look at the regular menu but I'm sure it's wonderful.  From what I can tell this is best as a special occasion/date establishment; in other words, don't wear your tattered shorts and flip flops, and leave the kids at home.    I unfortunately didn't explore the entire restaurant, which looks as though it was formerly a house or something; the rooms inside are probably lovely.  The bar area is quaint, seats 4 or 5, and has an attractive laquered wooden bartop.  It's just beautiful from the outside; gorgeous back patio--quite easily on my list of top 5 best patios I've seen in Phoenix.  Perfectly dimmed clear-bulb lights are strewn across this open-air brick patio, complete with a wood burning fireplace in one corner, and surrounded by tall Oleander bushes.  These outdoor tables even have white tablecloths and candles, very romantic.  Service was outstanding from start to finish, and when I say start I mean from the moment I made my Open Table reservation.  I called to confirm their BYOB policy and upon speaking to a gentleman on the phone (I believe it may have been the owner's son?) learned that it has changed.  You may still bring your own wine if you join their wine club.  I won't go into details lest I give out incorrect information; just know this: they have a full bar, complete with impressive (albeit very small) wine list, cocktails, etc, so **do not go by what Open Table says**... you do **not** have to bring your own wine in order to drink some.  Also, on Open Table I was given the option to make a reservation as late as 9:30, so I made mine for 9pm.  Upon calling about the wine policy, I discovered they're only open til 9.  I felt badly and almost cancelled, but the gentleman on the phone said to please still come in, that they looked forward to it.  Despite that my reservation was at the time of close, I was treated as though I were the first guest in the door.  I never felt rushed; on the contrary had great conversations with Nicole, Andrea, and Wes, as well as a couple other employees who came out to the patio briefly.  Everyone was SO hospitable, kind, and pleasant.  If my wallet were fatter I'd come in every week just to see these people!  So as I said, I came here for Restaurant Week; was very happy with everything. The escargot was delicious, mostly because of the heavenly buttery sauce it was in.  The Beef Tenderloin was very tender, cooked to a perfect medium rare. I admit the sauce wasn't as delectable as I'd expected; perhaps it needed more cognac?  Regardless, very flavorful.  For dessert I had the Chocolate Espresso Eclair with espresso mousse, caramel corn, and chocolate covered espresso beans. YUM. Excellent and provided a little kick after dinner with the mini caffeine boost.  My only wish for Coup Des Tartes is for them to get an espresso machine (unless there is one hiding somewhere I didn't see...?), but it isn't reason enough to drop a star from my rating."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place.  It's been around for 10 years.  Just down the street from me and for some reason I just never got around to going.  Finally, in November my mom and I went for dinner.  Amazing!  I'm a convert!  I'll be a Coup Des Tartes for special occasions and just for fun!    The food was wonderful.  Recognizable with a twist.  Fresh ingredients and really nice service.  This little place has more character in its little pinky that so many other restaurants in the Valley.  From the pictures on the walls and photographs on the fireplace to the staff.    I took my boyfriend for a romantic date night the weekend before Christmas and it was great.  He said the same thing I'd been thinking, \"WHY haven't we been coming here for years?\"  I think I thought that it was much more expensive than it was.  Mom and I had one app, one salad and two entrees for $80 (including tax and corkage) and BF and I had one app, one salad, two entrees, one dessert and two corking fees for $121 (including tax and corkage).  No bad folks.  Pretty darn good actually.  It's BYOB, so we had wine that would have cost us over $150 in a restaurant, but we brought it from home.  I love it!  Standouts for me were the mushroom & Gruyere tarte, lovely and cheesy and flaky all at the same time.  The lox and potato appetizer was fabulous, and I'm not a big lox fan and I loved this.  The baby arugula salad with pears, feta and candied pecans was a perfect balance of flavors and textures.  The lamb entree is good and surprisingly, I tried the chicken cordon bleu and it was terrific!  Most amazing though, is the Grand Canyon dessert -- layers and layers of chocolate and peanut butter mousse.  Light and fluffy and rich and decadent!  Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"Nice cozy place. A bit pricey. Used a groupon to go for the first time which helped the bill."}
{"text":"What a great gem, possibly one of the few restaurants that isnt based in a strip mall or a hotel.  Instead it is in a nice converted old home, a home that was the owners home when he was a child.    We were warmly greeted and shown to our table.  We love the fact that this place is BYOB with only a $9 corkage.  In Portland, where we live, most places don't allow BYOB and if they do its usually $15-25 a bottle.   Instead we were able to enjoy wine we picked out ourselves to match our tastes and budget.    We started off with  a tasty cheese and onion savory tart with greens.  Then we each chose a salad, both were good though my wife's choice the Taleggio was much better especially with the Prickly Pear Vinaigrette and Teleggio Cheese.    For Entrees my wife chose the duck and I opted for the Filet.  The duck was really savory, the rhubarb glaze was the highlight of the dish.  I only got two little bites but each was very good.  The Filet was good a nice piece of meat, the horseradish creme fraiche was a nice touch but it was the amazing locally grown heirloom tomatoes that put the dish apart.  Great acidity to match up with the meat.  For dessert we split the carmel chocolate tart which was sort of a crisp brownie base with a gooey carmel that was a good way to finish the evening though the next time we come back we will opt for a few nice cheeses instead.   A wonderful setting, great staff, plenty of parking and great food for a very reasonable price.  What more could you ask for? Well even though they seem quite busy the night we were there they now have a summer special limited menu for a very reasonable price.  Now there is no reason you should not go.  Next time we are back in Phoenix we will be back to Coup Des Tartes."}
{"text":"Two hours to get our dinner. Slow, indifferent and inattentive service. Water or bleach?  Both we thought. Entrees arrived at room temperature...owner walked into our room to ask the two tables near us how the meal was but didn't bother to look in our direction....may I say that we didn't complaint, our party of four were cordial and hoped that someone, somehow, would try to make the evening right but it never happened. Disappointing to say the least. However, our Bacchus charcuterie tray was spectacular but then again, I doubt the cheeses on that board were made in house."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and staff. The appetizers( pate and escargot) were great. The onion soup was mediocre, especially for a french restaurant. My wife's lamb dish was good. I have the filet and is was just ok. All-in-all a romantic place to eat, just wish the food was better."}
{"text":"Ahh date night. What a great chance to chill out with your loved one and enjoy a nice meal. We were decently happy with the result. Coup de Tartes was a good place, not amazing, but def a good little place to escape Scottsdale's scene.  The food was good but nothing that blew my mind. We had a caprese salad and brie brûlée to start. The caprese was seasoned very well with a good balsamic and tasted very fresh. Guess you really have to suck to mess that up though. I was a little let down with my Brie brûlée, just seemed like they grabbed a slice of Brie, baked it, threw some bruleed apples on top and tossed some fruit on the plate. I mean I love cheese so it was just fine, but I guess I should have asked for something more involved. We also had the summer chicken and filet. The chicken was done very well and came out very tasty with vegetables inside and a great pesto sauce on top. Excellent mashed potatoes. My filet was just ok. Nothing I've never had before and the horseradish sauce was tasty but can def throw someone off if your not into it. Personally I don't like horseradish but I still enjoyed it, so that's a good sign. The side of frites were delicous. Freshly cut potatoes with the skin left on and a drizzle of Parmesan. You can tell I'm a starch kind of a guy.   Then there was the real winner, the highlight of our night, the thing that made it allllll worth it....Chocolate Caramel Tart. Damn. This was absolutely delicious. They brought it to us and by the time the waiter had their back turned, poof, it was gone. Great texture, amazing flavor, awesome crust. Simply delicious.  The decor was what I expected. Cute and a solid effort to be romantic, set in what seemed like a little cottage. I've seen more romantic (ex Little Door in LA) so this was just ok. Only a few tables so it's def an intimate setting, luckily we had no one sitting next to us. It was a little warm (thermostat read 86) but I guess everyone is having trouble in this summer desert heat, and I would have chosen different music, but all in all a very nice and original set up.  PS my gf yelled at me to give it 4 stars based on dessert alone. Soooo maybe 3.5 will have to do. Compromise...that's how relationships work right?!  pps We were sitting under the thermostat....no I'm not crazy."}
{"text":"Ate there on Friday night. Took out of town guests. Were disappointed.  My three onion tart was delicious, but I don't think they need to add sugar to the tart pastry. My sisters fish was good. Basically, the dishes themselves were fine though not exceptional.  The bread was cold and the plates were cold, which is disappointing.  The decor is very plain and not charming. Why do they need a TV in the bar?!  While noise levels were good, rooms feel cramped and crowded."}
{"text":"I am retiring and was asked where I would like to go to eat for my retirement dinner.  I thought French. Looked on Yelp and found Coup Des Tartes. Reviews were good so that was my choice. Seven people went. My boss his boss who was paying, my wife and three friends.  We got two appetizers. Chevre/Tomate and Interesting Cheese. Both were excellent choices. I got the Mozzarella and Tomato Salad. It was OK but I would get something else next time. My wife got the Taleggio Salad and said it was very good. I was torn between getting the Ahi Tuna and the Lamb Shank. I asked the server and she said the Lamb Shank is one of the specialties. So I went with the lamb. Great choice. My wife has to be on a no meat diet so she had the Coup Veggie Pasta. She commented that it was excellent. Then came desert. By now I have had way more to eat than anyone should but I wanted to end this night with a desert. I had the Four Berry Tart. Great choice.  I am sorry I did not get the waitresses name. She was very attentive and helpful.  Dinner lasted from 6:30 to 9:30. Many stories about work and my 39 years with the company.  On leaving I had several people in the group come up and say what a good choice I had made. Everyone really did enjoy their meal. I will go back again. You should go also. You will not regret going the food is the best I have had in Phoenix to date."}
{"text":"A friend of mine told me about this place and that she had been wanting to go forever so the next double date night we had, we opted to make reservations for the four of us. I easily made reservations on their website through Urban Spoon for 8pm on Saturday night.  We arrived a bit earlier than the other couple but were able to be sat at our table while we waited. Given the pictures I had seen online, our table seemed to be located in the less romantic room of the place. We were in a back room with a table for four and two other tables for two. While the house did have some character with the wood floors, as our other friends arrived they mentioned 'I think we're in a kids bedroom'. There weren't any candles and the lights were up all the way so definitely not a romantic vibe. We also had several visitors to the closet behind our table throughout our meal checking wires or something.  Our server was good and her timing was great. We inquired about the BYOB and it was $10 for the cork fee. I've never been to a restaurant where they do this so it was definitely new. I'm still undecided how I feel about having to pay them $10 PER BOTTLE to drink my own wine. To each their own I guess.   All of the food was really good. We ordered the Three Onion Tarte and the other couple had the Brie Brûlée. Both were really good and different. We shared the Taleggio salad and while our waitress said all of the salads were incredible, I can't say I was overly impressed. They did split it for us which is always welcomed but it didn't have anything memorable about it and I didn't care for the prickly pear dressing paired up with the fruit. I was the only one at the table who ventured out for the filet and the other three ordered the Pork Tenderloin. My filet was cooked perfectly and the tangy sauce was really good and complimented the steak really well! Unfortunately the vegetable medley over the steak had mushrooms in it, something I don't like and would have requested be left out of the dish but wasn't specified on the menu. I spent a lot of time picking through my plate as I ate. The mash potatoes were good I think. Someone asked me the next day what came with my steak and I honestly didn't remember if it came with potatoes or not and had to look up the menu to refresh my memory. Maybe it was the wine.   For dessert we shared the peanut butter and chocolate pie dish, it was good, rich and only needed a few bites. The dinner was perfectly timed and we were having such a good conversation, we ended up closing down the restaurant and they graciously never rushed us out of there. The owner did stop by our table and was really friendly and I appreciated the attention. Overall, it was a pretty good visit and we might try it again once they move into their new location."}
