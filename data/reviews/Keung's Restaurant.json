{"text":"Came here for their afternoon special/super early dinner on a weekend. The afternoon special menu provides a rather big variety, ranging from meal sized dishes to snacks/side orders. It also comes with a generous list of beverages that comes free with the food. We ordered: 
- Guilin style soup vermicelli: The flavour was on the sour side, but not in a bad way (more like an \"appetizing\" kind of sour). Generous amount of minced meat and preserved vegetables on top. 
- Baked beef brisket on rice with curry sauce: Curry sauce was pretty good and the beef brisket slices are large and nicely cooked. 
- Red bean/grass jelly ice cream float: Delicious and not overly sweet! 

Overall, fairly impressed. Dishes were generously portioned and flavourful, and prices are competitive. Would come back again!"}
{"text":"We ordered from here after a major mishap with Congee queen.  We waited 4 hours for delivery at CQ and nothing. Called Keungs for back up and they had our order ready in 30 minutes. Food was great. From now on I'm ordering and coming here. Thanks Keungs!"}
{"text":"Wife and I went to this restaurant on November 23, 2015. We ordered: beef brisket with ho fun noodles, tofu and garoupa fish on plain rice, salt and pepper pork. The meal also included complementary soup and warm sweet tofu for dessert.

The dishes were ok, nothing special. 

Not sure what caused it, but both of us had diarrhea that night. My wife continued to have it the next day as well."}
{"text":"Ordered the steamed chicken and fried rice in hot pot.  Unfortunately the dish had a ton of rice but only 7 small pieces of chicken.  The fried rice only had pieces of taro and nothing else.  Very plain and cheap on anything savory.  When we spoke to the waiteress, she said that it's supposed to be like that because they only serve it with a quarter chicken.  However, it doesn't say only 1/4 chicken on the menu and it definitely looks like more chicken in the photo.  Definitely not worth its 12$ price."}
{"text":"There's other Keung's restaurants in GTA but this one is horrible. We ordered the seafood fried rice and they have more pineapple chunks than seafood,( so that it their rice looks \"fuller with stuff\"). Also ordered the stirfry beef black bean sauce w/ ho fun and we literally counted 4 black beans and their sauce had eggs in it. I'm not a picky eater AT ALL, but this place was hands down, both thumbs down!"}
{"text":"This is a typical Hong Kong style eatery with so so service. Food is OK, price is right. I don't like the noisy environment because the laminate walls that bounce noise badly. The waitresses are always setting table with clinging utensils that make the place like dai pai dong! Very very noisy!"}
{"text":"Loud and busy. Decently priced. Not for the claustrophobic.

Food: 4/5 Price well. Good congee.
Service: 3/5 Okay. Some are really nice.
Environment: 2/5 Seating is tight and awkward. 
Washrooms: 4/5 Quite clean.
Worth it?: 3/5 If you have time to wait. Budget food.

This place has been around for quite awhile. It is still as busy as I remember it being. Some of the service is super efficient and doesn't speak much while some go out of their way to be super nice. 

The food is good. The congee and staples like beef fried rice noodles aways come out really good. Their milk tea wasn't very good tho. Luckily it was free with there mid day special. Free tea drink with purchase of $8.50 and up.

The wait is long at time so beware of that. I will definitely come back even tho there are other restaurants that has a similar selection I still want to try."}
{"text":"So-so. After coming here a few times, I can say only the congee and the fried donuts were a hit for me. Rice toppings were alright. Anything with fish, shrimp and etc all have bones/shell which I'm not personally a fan of."}
{"text":"Came for a late dinner on a Friday night. The restaurant was around 85% full.

I noticed that they had colourful cups of green, yellow, and orange which was cool. As well as black plates and bowls. 

We wanted to order the salted bone congee and pan fried tofu with minced fish on a sizzling plate, but were told that they ran out. We opted for the Fukin Style steamed tofu and the garoupa with bitter melon in hot pot instead. As well, we ordered the black bean sauce steamed oysters, beef and mushroom on a sizzling plate and a mango slush. 

The beef and mushroom was good. There were lots of large mushrooms along with the beef. I would say there were slightly more mushrooms than the beef. This dish was a bit on the oily and salty side. Some of the oil even sizzled on my hand when it arrived on our table. However, it was still good. 

The Fukin style steamed tofu came in a wooden barrel pot which I thought was cute. There was a layer of leaves on the bottom. The tofu pieces were large and quite smooth. The tofu was topped with a variety of items like bbq pork, bbq duck, shrimp, dried scallop, peas carrots, and squid. I enjoyed the variety with this dish and the portion was large. 

The black bean sauce steamed oysters were very fresh! The oysters are from B.C. Fanny Bay. I have to say, they were steamed just right. The oysters were quite large and the black bean sauce took over a bit of the oyster flavour. There were some yellow, red, and green bell peppers topped with the sauce. I recommend ordering this as it was half a dozen for $13.95! 

The garoupa with bitter melon in a hot pot had a good ratio of bitter melon and the fish. Although it was on the oily side, it was flavourful. The fish was also quite tasty. 

The mango slush was better than expected. It was icy and tasted of pureed or mango syrup. Nonetheless, it was refreshing!

We were also served with complimentary dessert after our meal. It was the mung bean soup which was cooked well. 

The staff were attentive and the dishes were well portioned and tasted good. I definitely recommend getting the steamed oysters as they were really fresh and large!"}
{"text":"- extremely solid eats. 
- the seafood congee is freakishly amazing!
- also discovered fish paste cooked into the long donut thing (it doesnt translate well).... winner."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for Keung's! Great choice for dinner with the family - lots of dishes to choose from here. I am a huge fan of their peppered \"hot pot\" soup with pork bones and veggies (see photo). Other items I tend to order over and over again include their soft shell crab fried rice, pork chop and onions with rice, chicken hot pot rice, and clams in spicy broth.

They can get busy on weekends and finding parking can be a pain in this plaza, but I would recommend going to Keung's for some good Chinese food."}
{"text":"We were in the area and decided to eat somewhere at New Kennedy Square. Since it was after 8pm, we thought we could find parking (this mall is notorious for its lack of dinner-time parking). The lot was still pretty full, but we found a spot.

When it comes to malls like NKS, we rely pretty heavily on Yelp for restaurant advice since we're not that familiar with Asian cuisines and many of these restaurants look similar from the outside. Since Allison had given Keung's four stars, we decided to check it out.

The atmosphere in the restaurant is quite pleasant; it's clean, has nice lighting and the booths are comfortable. It was still pretty busy at 8pm, but not so busy that the staff should have completely ignored us, which they did. Any time we needed anything, we really had to make an effort to flag them down.

I had the \"shredded beef with black pepper on sizzling plate\" and the portion size was huge. The beef was well seasoned and very tender, and the peppers and onions complemented the meat well. They obviously use a lot of salt because I was very thirsty afterwards, but it was a very delicious meal nonetheless. 

I'd like to return to try some of the other dishes. Hopefully next time the service will be better!"}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place for my family to go... and it did not disappoint!! From their soup, to congee... from pork belly to shrimp sticky rice... they tasted very delicious, and fresh... Reservation is recommended... they are just so packed ALL THE TIME!!! so if you don't want to wait... make reservation!! and if you dont' know what to order... just look at the menu and order from the picture!! they come out look like the picture i must say... 

NOT DISAPPOINTED AT ALL... good job...

oh, by the way, i heard they have different branch... and someone say this branch is better compare to others... but i didn't try other branch... so can't say.. :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken congee, steamed rice noodles, and eggplant stone pot. Everything was great, on point and to my liking! The chicken congee was big enough to share amongst 4 people, and multiple times. It wasn't too watery or thick, it was just right and had chunks of chicken (with bone). The steamed rice noodles was silky and topped with peanut and hoisin sauce. The eggplant stone pot came out sizzling and piping hot! The flavor was right on, sweet and delicious. Definitely try their house made chili hot sauce located at the tables."}
{"text":"Come here whenever my family chooses it, but definitely not my personal cup of tea.

Food is decent, but there are definitely a few dishes that stand out to me. Their BBQ pork are one of the most flavourful if you enjoy ones that have tons of fat and are swimming in soya sauce. The deep fried tofu is also amazing, but not the healthiest. Another amazing dish is the hot pot dishes, with soup, veggies, and pork bone. Best ordered during the winter with a bunch of people. 

Service is okay, as they always have enough people working. A reservation is advised as they are busy most nights/weekends."}
{"text":"I usually come for the tea time specials and occasionally for dinner.   My last visit was during tea time.   To describe the experience in two words: overpriced mediocrity. 

My husband got the black pepper chicken rice which consisted of 80% rice with a funky tasting black pepper sauce and some fried chicken.   If you want to upgrade to the baked version with fried rice, expect to pay $1 more.   That special cost $8.95 and included a special drink ie.  Red bean and black jelly drink.   

I got a fried soft bone chicken which was really tasty.   However I've had ones comparable or tastier for a smaller fraction of the price.  

I don't know if I'd go back for tea time given the higher prices."}
{"text":"Don't order the so-called \"Chicken Balls with Rice\" dish (?????) from their Afternoon Tea menu. It's a misnomer. There are no chicken balls and instead, it's cheap chicken strips (like the kind you get with noodle soups) in a goop of thick starchy sauce (??). When I asked the server about this, he was like, \"yeah, it's kind of like chicken balls but in strip form\". Ugh. Waste of my $10.45. Rice was also hard and not fresh."}
{"text":"Came here after swimming classes tonight. We haven't been here in a while and it's going to stay that way. 
The food wasn't too great but deserves 3 stars. The dishes could have been a bit bigger. The home style vermicelli was rubbish to look at but tasted ok. You can get much better from a food court stall. The place was half full and not as busy as it used to be. I much prefer Conger Queen to here. 
What made me give a 2 star rating was the service. Service here has NEVER been any good but tonight was crappier than ever before. Miserable, rude, uninterested staff. Looking at us like we killed their whole family. Was extremely bad, even for Chinese standards. 
Why would you come here for food and be treated like crap? You could get away with it years ago, when we basically had few options. But in this day and age, it's totally unacceptable. I'd even go to Power King over here."}
{"text":"I came here for a Hong Kong style brunch with my fiance and his family on our second day in Markham. The restaurant is mid-sized and definitely a good place to come for brunch, lunch, or dinner. Service is pretty on point. We ordered a lot of dishes, but I didn't get to take pictures of everything we ate. Here's what I tried and my thoughts:

Chef Style Chicken Congee - apparently this is one of the highlighted dishes in this restaurant, so we gave it a shot. I normally don't have congee with chicken, but it was interesting. It felt very simple, healthy and light. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a simple congee.

Beef Chow Fun - I wanted this dish since I haven't had it in a long, long time. The dish is somewhat different from what we have here in New York. The noodles were different in terms of type of noodles. It also tasted slightly charred/burnt which was a bit of a throw-off.

Sweet Cruller & Dough Cruller - we got both since some of us wanted the dough cruller for the congee and some of us wanted the sweet cruller. Both were fresh and not stale at all. 

Sweet Deep Fried Crispy Milk Block - my future sister in-law ordered this as a snack/appetizer and it was definitely golden, deep-fried. It had a crunchy and moist, melt-in-your-mouth texture. I wasn't a huge fan about this dish.

Plain Rice Noodle Roll - OMG! This was absolutely amazing, better than what we have in New York. The rice noodle roll was moist and just mixed very well with the sesame sauce. 

Overall, the experience here was better than the Keung's Delight restaurant we went to our first night in Markham. Service was better and the food was pretty good too. I would definitely come back here for Hong Kong style brunch!"}
{"text":"Good Chinese restaurant; came here for lunch;

Place is very spacious and seems clean. We were seated quickly. The congee was delicious; so was the rice noodle rolls. However the rolls were Hong Kong style with a lot of sesame sauce on it; they were more like snack to me, unlike the ones I usually have, with meat and vegetables inside and soy sauce all over.

Servers were young and energetic; they were very polite to us; however when they talked amongst themselves in Cantonese, it was loud. (I didn't mind it too much tho....Seen worse at other Chinese restaurants)

Will go back again to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"This review is based on their afternoon tea which runs from 3pm to 5:30pm on weekdays and 3pm to 5:00pm on weekends. All items on the menu come with a drink and there's a decent selection on the menu. Keung's is a place I find to be really good value based on the portions and quality of food that you're getting. The place also appears clean which is a plus.

On my last visit, I had: 

Pepper Salt Chicken Thigh ($9.95) - Delicious!! I started drooling the minute it was placed on our table because it smelled amazing! So crispy and perfectly seasoned. It's a must try but just make sure you have a rice along with it since it's considered a side order dish. Slightly on the pricey side for this one but worth it.

Crispy Chicken on Rice & Groupa on Rice ($8.95 each) - Black pepper sauce on the chicken and cream sauce for the groupa, both which I thoroughly enjoyed. Not too salty or heavy. However, I did feel like there wasn't enough sauce in proportion to the amount of rice. Asked for more and they were happy to give us a small bowl on the side. Bonus points! They do their baked rice very well and I would highly recommend it. Portions are humongous. We couldn't finish it between 2 people.

The drinks are not bad either. I really like the red bean & black jelly drink with icecream. It's great during the summer.

Service is decent. They do their job and will get you what you need. I never expect great service from these types of places so as long as they're not overly rude or unaccomodating, I'm not bothered.

The prices have increased slightly (at least since July 2015 when I last came) which is a little disappointing but the place is consistently good so it won't stop me from coming back. Still a solid cheap eats!"}
{"text":"With all the hoopla about this place, it came out disappointing.  The service was slow and the food was not the greatest.  I wanted to try this restaurant because I thought it was better than Congee Queen, but nah!!! it was not good at all."}
{"text":"We've been going to this restaurant since it opened over 15 years ago.  This is one of the only Chinese restaurants that have kept their standards up.  They're staff is friendly and quick.  The food prices have gone up with inflation, but is still a very good price for what you get.  I'm not a fan of the \"new\" plastic ware though as any left over debris shows up on the black plastic bowls.  They're veggies are ALWAYS fresh compared to other similar type restaurants."}
{"text":"No more lunch specials on weekdays.  If you order entree over $8, you still get free drink.  
Big bowl of soup noodle - portion much smaller than what you would get at Congee Queen.  Stir fried rice noodle with beef was good.  Large portion, non-greasy.  Needed more salt but pretty tasty.
Restaurant only had 3 tables of customers for lunch but food took more than 15 minutes to arrive.  Overall good service but no longer good value at lunch."}
{"text":"A meal is so much sweeter after you've worked for your meat. In this case, that'd be the trek it took me to get here. Armed with a couple of dining friends, we descended on Keung's: ravenous, anxious, curious.

Curious: Keung's 2 menus offer both Hong Kong style cafe options like spaghetti and tomato sauce, an array of congee, rice noodle dishes, hot pots, soups, spicy meats, and some standard dishes like lemon chicken and chicken cashew. If you're choice adverse, better let someone else do the picking!

Anxious: Not unlike other Cantonese restaurants I've encountered, service was slow. We had to wave down a server. Eye contact and arm waving doesn't always work. Come prepared to work for their attention. This, however, was all quickly forgotten when the free soup arrived. Drink it, it's quite delicious. Also, red bean soup is offered for dessert. If you've saved room, go for it!

Ravenous: We ate like kings: garlic eggplant hotpot, chicken with rice noodles, spicy beef - served in a cone and tinfoil, and chicken with cashew. 
The winner? Eggplant hotpot. Warning: watch for the spicy beef - it be VERY spicy!

We left stuffed, with enough food left over for breakfast and lunch the following day. Big portions, decent prices ($45 for all that), housed in a contemporary setting. Final judgement: I'd make the trek again. 

*Debit and cash only*"}
{"text":"I went to Keung's restaurant over the weekend with my family.  The place was plenty busy and we had to wait about 15 minutes before we got our seats.  The staff was pretty friendly and helpful but they were rushing around to get the customers served. I think service at this location is about average, comparable to similar Chinese restaurants that I have visited like Congee Queen or Congee Wong.  We ordered 6 dishes for our dinner meal: 

-Keung's signature chicken with rice
-fish congee
-beef stir fry noodles
-scallops
-salt & pepper pork chops
-eggplant & minced meat

I liked the noodles and scallops, they were well prepared and savory.  The congee and other dishes were about average quality and I though the chicken was a little bit light on seasoning.  The size of the dishes is ok, we had enough food to go around and a little bit left over at the end.

We received complimentary starters soup and dessert from the restaurant and the meal cost about $18 per person.  I thought the table we sat at was a little bit small and it would have been nice to have a little more space and larger table.

Overall, this meal and experience is about the same as my other visits to Keung's -  This is a restaurant I would occasionally visit, but would not be a top eating destination."}
{"text":"Went here for a mid night treat because we arrived very late from NYC- this spot is simple amazing!!! I love The numbing beef and the Congee are amazing- this spot is just amazing. I wish they will open a location in New York 
The vegs was the only con because they gave us the wrong dish but they very kind! The offer us 10% off because of this mistake"}
{"text":"Having a late bite due to some meetings, refraining from eating anything heavy Keungs seemed to be the safe choice to eat at.
I believe this may be the 'original' Keung's location at Peach Tree Plaza (Kennedy and Hwy 7).

Craving some Chinese comfort food we ordered their seafood congee (big-bowl) served with shrimps, squid, scallops and salmon, 3.5/5
Rather than ordering their fried dough, we opted for their Chili turnip cake, which I've had at other locations.  Slight crunch on the outside, soft inside, nonetheless  it was tasty about a 4/5.
Overall the service was 'OKAY' and their prices are really reasonable.  In terms of cleanliness, its about a 3.5/5."}
{"text":"The server's were all nice and smiley except one who seemed grumpy when we asked for more napkins. Everything we ordered was bland! The complimentary soup was really watered down that no one wanted to finish their bowls. The best dish was probably the garlic veggies.  The crab fried rice was the most disappointing order... The rice was so plain! Even the crab legs/claws had no taste, not even a hint of salt water taste. Would unlikely come back."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Keung's that I've been too. The service is quick and the food is very good also. It's not as big as the other one but sat comfortably. I wouldn't mind kept coming here."}
{"text":"Besides the congee, noodles and snacks (street-style rice noodle roll), the dinner menu is actually not bad. 

- dried-fish fried gai lan 
- oyster omelette 
- steamed crab rice

Note the chicken hot pot rice is fried rice instead of white rice. It's alright, I like it 'cause it has bits of taro in it. 

Dinner served with complementary soup and dessert (usually sweet potato?)

Definitely keep this in mind for an alternative to hk style cafes without paying premium restaurant prices."}
{"text":"One of my must stops in T.O. is Congee Wong! My MIL recommended Keung's instead this time to try and because she's such an awesome foodie - we went to check it out.

We got congee (of course) in Lai Wan (very tasty) and Special (has liver chunks). The congee was really tasty and my hubby had an OMG moment over the flavorfulness of the special congee. We also got Chinese donut (very crispy), Singapore radish cake (not as good as Congee Wong, but decent), and crispy noodles (ok). My GIL says that usually the meals come with a free drink and after a simple asking of the waitresses we got free hot drinks (milk tea, ying yang milk tea, coffee, and lemon tea)! The prices are very reasonable (much cheaper than in the States for sure). 

Restaurant itself was clean and I can't wait for the next time I'm in town for more!"}
{"text":"I must be honest when I first walked in and looked at the menu I wasn't sure what I was going to get. 

We ordered way too much, one dish each person is way more than you will need here. 

We ordered Hot and Sour soup, Soy Sauce Beef noodles, Shrimp Wonton noodle soup and the Garlic Eggplant hot pot. 

The menu is massive, in fact they have two menus. The larger menu consists of congee, noodles, lomein, lo rice and other selections such as spaghetti if you can believe it. Looking at the menu I was a bit worried as to what to expect. 

Well, it was tasty. I'm a big fan of Hot and Sour soup, and the Hot and Sour here was tasty and actually was spicy and Sour, usually hot and sour is neither at most places. 

I would go back over and over again to eat the Hot Pot Eggplant, the next time I go, I'm ordering that and steamed rice and that is it. 

One side note was the wait staff took the time to inform me the \"Garlic Eggplant Hot pot as pork in it, in case I was a vegetarian\" I'm not, but thought that was a nice touch. 

The acoustics in this place are not good at all, it was only about 2/3rds full and at times I could not hear my wife talking. Very noisy. Be prepared to yell if you go when its busy. 

Its average run of the mill Chinese, I will return when I want to go to a place that offers everything and try some other things."}
{"text":"Great food, with lots of new interesting varieties I've never had.  
The service manager is really good at her job but the waiters are a bit lacking in friendliness / responsiveness.

Good oysters on a stick, wonton noodles, baked chicken over rice, seafood congee (had shrimp and squid and some other stuff), fried fish cake in eggplant (i don't even like eggplant), tofu stew (this microwaved well the next day too!).

We also got War Mein, that wasn't so good, it was like the stuff you get at a wedding and always so under seasoned and soft.

We actually went here twice this year on our trip because we liked it so much :) I rarely go back to a place twice on a trip because I want to try new things all the time."}
{"text":"Have you ever had something your whole life and thought this is probably the best it's going to taste? That was my thought about congee until I had it here. The chicken congee and Chef style fish, shrimp & crab meat congee was simply amazing. The cooking time for the congee was perfect, which resulted in the finest texture. The seasoning was perfect; it tasted heavenly. I live in Boston, and I have never had congee this good. Definitely the best place for congee hands down.

Despite that, we ordered other things as well. The soy sauce chow mein, albeit a simple dish was excellent as well. My friends told me to eat with with the congee, and they were right, the noodles complement the congee very well. My friends also ordered the turnip patties (law bak go?), I didn't try them, but they said it was a bit under seasoned. 

Anyways, if you are around the Scarborough area, definitely give this place a try, they are worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for some quick fried rice or fried noodles and its pretty consistently good so this time around we though we would try something different.

Veggie Hotpot $16.99 - I'm not a big fan of hotpot, especially ones with no meat but I was not the one doing the ordering. Really disappointed with this dish. The soup was way too salty.

Crab on fried rice $20.99 - This dish was decent but there was very little crab meat and a bit on the pricy side.

Comes with soup dessert"}
{"text":"We came for afternoon tea (between 3 and 5). They have free drinks with any meal or side dish. The meals are reasonably priced, but the sides are pricey for what you get. Either way, you get a free drink with each order. The food is basic and simply done, but generously portioned.

Our ham in tomato sauce and spaghetti was exactly that, with the ham over cooked (unless you like it crispy) and the spaghetti a short tick past al dente. On the other hand, our bitter melon beef rice had the right amount of bitter melon, and lots of sauce to pour on the rice. My advice - stick with the Chinese options. 

The drinks skew Chinese, so if red bean doesn't sound to you like a dessert, then you will also not be impressed by grass jelly. The drinks are small, which is understandable since they are free. Less forgivable is that they somehow found the only vanilla ice cream in Toronto that is flavourless. 

They have a fried milk dessert that I didn't try, but is usually not easy to find. 

For those with kids, the restaurant is kid friendly. No kids menu, but the portions are eminent shareable and the seating area and washrooms relatively clean. My son devoured the pasta and ham. I guess he likes ham on the crispy side.  

The ambience is generally nice, but today they had big posters of \"Poon Choi\", which is a apparently a great dish featuring a big fish head that stares at you. I will try it next time."}
{"text":"The stuff is really really salty here.  Their fried tofu dish is really good when it's really hot.  But as the heat dies down you realize how much salt they put in the dish.  I was so insanely thirsty after I finished that dish.  We also ordered wings and a plate of veggies.  Veggies were ok - you can't screw up boiled vegetables.  The wings were also way too salty.  Maybe we ordered the wrong stuff but it definitely didn't stand out for me.  Service is at a normal pace."}
{"text":"I'm going to have to take away a star due to the fact service was atrocious today.

I also tried some other dishes, which were a hit and miss. The pork ribs with thousand island sauce and the seafood fried udon were both good, however the jellyfish with sliced beef was a disappointment. The jellyfish was too mushy and the sliced beef was too dry."}
{"text":"My family and I came here on Canada Day for dinner around 6pm. We were seated right away and our orders were placed. The staff was welcoming and answered our questions.

We got the broad egg noodles with veggies and chicken fried rice along with roasted pork and chicken wings. The portions were large enough for our table of 5! AND I had enough to take home (which I ate later that night). 

The dishes were all good and flavorful. I loved the hot sauce they gave us, it added flavor to all the meals. . mmm delishhhhhhhhh. The noodles were so juicy too! 

They included tip into the bill but were shocked when we asked for change.. If tip is added onto the bill.... why am I still leaving an extra 15%? We did not like that at all! Besides that, good food."}
{"text":"The crab fried rice is always amazing here. It's a show stopper with the wooden serving bowl that looks like a barrel, the crab she'll on top and the fish eggs scattered throughout the rice  like little jewels, full of delicious flavour. The smell of the fried rice is really appetizing and it hits you as soon as you remove the crab shell from the serving dish.

The roasted pigeon was delicious! The skin was crispy and the meat was soft, juicy and succulent. I'd definitely recommend getting it if you come here for dinner. It's served with a dipping salt that makes it even more appraising. 

We also ordered the juicy roast pork. The flavour was amazing, full of spices and slightly sweet.  However, when we got it it was cold and kind of dried out. I'm hoping it was just an off day, I'll try it again next time I visit to see if it's any better.

The service was also wonderful! The server was friendly and helpful. Also my friend was treating me and didn't look at the price properly when paying. They left anote unusually large tip, the waiter came out to tell us and ask if we had made a mistake. It was very honest of them (they has left a tip the equivalent of about 50% of the bill)."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the Keung's at Midland and Finch so it was only a matter of time before I gave this place a try as well.

Pros:
Very good congee
portions are very good

Cons:
Not as big as the other Keung's

Came here on a Sunday morning for breakfast.  We were originally going to go to a HK style cafe in the same plaza but all of them were super busy and we didn't want to wait for a table.  We were the first customers of the day so we had our choice on where to sit.  This Keung's is definitely not as big as the one I frequent at Finch and Midland.  After about 15 minutes, the place was basically full and anyone else coming in would have to wait.  The turnover time here is not as fast as a HK style cafe so it could be a wait depending on busy it is.  

On to the food.  The menu is the same one as the other Keung's so you'll know your way around if you already frequent that one.  I had the special salted pork bone congee which was on sale at the time.  My GF got the pork chop noodle.  We ordered some dough fritters for the congee as well.  My GF's noodle was pretty good.  She noted that they give you a lot of noodle.  The bowl is not the biggest, but they pack as much as they can.  

On to the congee. I'd have to say this was one of the best congee's I've ever had.  The salted pork bones they use give the congee a great bast taste.  The mustard greens give a contrast to the salty nature of the congee.  The pork bones themselves were a higher quality cut then you're garden variety ones you can find in a Chinese super market.  I'm not a fan of the preserved egg, but the congee was so good I didn't mind.  We ordered the super bowl size and for $8.99, it was worth every penny.

All in all, it was a nice experience.  It was a blessing in disguise that all the HK style cafe's were full and we ended up here.  I will definitely be back for the congee again when I'm craving it!"}
{"text":"Food is ok, my complaint about this location is the kitchen is super slow.  Work really close by here, so if I want this type of food for lunch. This is the place.

Every time I order congee take-out, I end up waiting 10 to 15 minutes even if I call 15, 20 minutes ahead of time knowing that they are slow..

Don't have this problem when I go to the Midland and Finch location."}
{"text":"This places is a must for us every time we come to Toronto (we are from Boston). I love the eggplant dish. Something about it makes me want more. The chicken congee is so smooth and flavorful. Goes very well with the eggplant dish. The rice noodle with peanut and hoisin(?) sauce is very delicious. Their homemade chili oil on the table is amazing! Dip a little of that chili oil with the rice noodle is like heaven! We like the chili oil so much we had to buy a jar of it to bring home. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Big portions, not too pricey and seems like our go-to place if we can't think of anything else to go to. Its close to home for me and food comes quickly.

Take-out is available and everything is pretty good. Nothing stellar but the prices are reasonable with good portions. Sometimes comes with complementary soup and dessert."}
{"text":"The appearance and choice are decent, liked the interior design too. 

Food was, however, unexpectedly below average. It taste like something you would order from a Chinese food court with a premium price. 

The staffs' mannerism was poor, not smiley and also were kinda ignorant. 

The place seems notable for social gathering of seniors or above middle aged people."}
{"text":"Closer to 3.5 stars . Located in a popular strip mall with plenty of asian restaurants in Markham. All affordable.
The decor was good, mix of modern and traditional.  We were in a rush and chose meals which could be easily prepared. Some of their specialties are cooked whole duck and meals in hot platters. We ate Chinese broccoli with , oyster sauce, minced pork lo mien (Chinese spaghetti), fried rice sea food platter with ice cream red bean drink.
The good: the service was great. All the servers were well versed in the menus.
The bad: it was crowded which is always a good sign but we were seated where the front entrance was so we got cold drafts often. Don't sit on that side of the restaurant.
The ugly: Due to the location, hard to find parking during most active hours. Tip: Get in early to park. Order lunch specials which are favs!"}
{"text":"Food: 3 stars
Ordered: pepper pork bone with mustard green in hot pot, shredded pork and penny hot sauce lo mein ,and deep fried squid with pepper salt. 
The pepper pork bone with mustard green in hot pot had a lot of vegetables, a fair number of pork bone pieces but there was basically NO MEAT on any of the bones so you're mainly relying on vegetables to get full. They gave us soy sauce and yes, you do need it because there isn't much taste to anything in the hot pot. Silver lining is that it's probably pretty healthy and MSG free. However, for $18.95, totally not worth it. Go have Korean pork bone soup and actually get some meat for half the price. 
That being said, the squid and lo mein were great. The lo mein is my usual go-to item here when I'm feeling indecisive. Consistently good. The squid had a good amount of batter with squid and the squid was firm yet tender enough that I don't have to play tug of war with it.

Ambiance: 3 stars
We sat at a round table but they have both seats too. Brightly lit. Casual setting. Awesome since they open late! 

Service: 3 stars
One of the ladies serving us seemed perpetually pissed off but after a while, you'll realize that it's nothing personal. She's probably just tired and means no harm. She warmed up a bit to us after a while. We got everything we asked for and all I can say is  It's standard Asian restaurant service. Don't go in expecting much."}
{"text":"We went at 11:30 on Saturday night for take-out beef brisket lo mein and veg lo mein soup.  The beef brisket lo mein was quite good--nothing special but no complaints.  The soup was only so-so.  Both were reasonably priced.  However, at that hour, it's good to have places that are still open.  And tons of free parking too."}
{"text":"Came here with family, got seated at the back of the restaurant, which was not convenient when ordering since the waiters didn't notice us almost a lot of times. We ordered 4 dishes: (1) a pork bone with pepper soup which came in a big pot. The soup was nice, it reminded me of those soups you would get at a typical Chinese restaurant for dinner but with a hint of white pepper since you would feel the kick of spice after a little bit. My parents thought the bones didn't have much meat in them (I mean, why would they, they are bones....). (2) HOMEMADE BBQ pork, I was a sucker for BBQ pork so I had to order it. The sauce was really sweet and would pair well with rice, but the pork had too much fat in them and basically was sliced pork belly with sweet sauce. (3) The Spicy beef... Holy Cow was that dish spicy. As soon as the server opened the foil wrap, all you see was beef covered with tons of dried red peppers and peppercorns. Beside the spiciness, you could also taste a hint of cumming which was really nice. However, it was just too spicy. (4) The restaurant's signature chicken rice. It tasted like... chicken rice! The rice was cooked with chicken oil and boiled in a clay pot. The chicken pieces on top were not too tough and quite tender. 

Overall, I would say this restaurant probably is better for ordering congee, wonton noodles, etc, but not dinner dishes as the food was not as great as people said. Not say that I wouldn't come here again for dinner, but it would not be my first choice."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick late night bite to eat and the place does its job. Cheap food and big portions, what I like. Not the best food but you get what yoy pay for."}
{"text":"I been to Keung Kee here for lunch, dinner, late night and take out!! 

Yes I just have a shrimp and scallops congee for takeout yesterday night for dinner.

The food here is always good. Good price, big portion.

The only item on the menu I don't enjoy is the singapore turnip cake, if you order it you will regret why you don't eat at Congee Wong across the mall instead.

They don't have stuffed steamed rice noodle all day like Congee Wong. Though their dinner dishes has better selections and tasted much better.

Another plus it is open till 2 AM on weekends!

The services here are always friendly and fast!

One thing they need to work on is cleanliness.......

CASH only!"}
{"text":"Great food selection and service was very fast. My favorite dish was the BBQ pork. Prices are fair, not overly pricey and not super cheap."}
{"text":"So I rarely do reviews and nor do i really leave 1 star reviews, but this is one of the worst experiences I have ever had. I am not from the area and I took a trip to Toronto to meet some of my friends. They chose this spot as there were decent reviews of the place and took a chance at this restaurant. As a party of 5 people around he ages of 22-24 we were treated with the least amount of care during the dinner rush. Generally, I am a patient and understanding person who knows about the working environment and how mistakes and other unanticipated occurrences happen. I tend to overlook mistakes because we are human and we all make mistakes, however, this restaurant wait staff took it too far.

I am very well aware of the Chinese culture and how some people do not care for western mannerisms and such which I do not mind at all. As we sit down and started to look at the menu, my friend remarked that he was not interested in eating much so we helped pick out something that was small, which was the beef satay in pickled noodle soup. As we wait for almost 45 minutes for our food to come out, we noticed that my friend had received an order that was different from the one he ordered. We spoke to the waitress and she insisted that we ordered this dish and would not change the order. There could've been some miscommunication so he ended up taking the higher road and just stuck with what he got. After all this waiting and such, I was eager to dig in to my beef brisket ho fun that I had been waiting for 45 minutes for. I would not have had such an issue with this problem if the food was good, but it was such a huge disappointment. Food was bland and greasy, took too long to get to us,  very skimpy on the meats and the wait staff was the absolute worst as they ignored/avoided us most of the time. Even with such bad service, I personally left a small tip and got up. Unfortunately my friends did not have the same grace and did not leave a tip.

As we got up and walked through the door, the waitress ran up to us and exclaimed that we did not leave a tip. She could not get it past her head that the service that was provided was below subpar and left us with one of the worst restaurant experiences we ever had. Needless to say, we will not be back at this restaurant for the lack of service, accomodation, and care that a customer needs. We fear that because we were a young group of people that we were put last in the priority list in the restaurant and I really do hope that they fix this and treat everyone equally."}
{"text":"Why the 4 stars?  Keung's makes me miss home town.  Keung's is a typical Hong Kong style neighbourhood restaurant that you can find anywhere in Hong Kong.  Similar menu items, similar cooking style, similar pricing strategy.  

Food: Keung's offers large portioned, delicious food that is loaded with salt and MSG.  Flavourful is the characteristics of all the dishes we have eaten here.  While we usually order low the mid priced items, Keung's also offers more expensive flair such as whole crab on rice.  

Price: Food is reasonably priced, which is a typical characteristic of a neighbourhood restaurant in Hong Kong, because neighbourhood restaurants survive on repeated businesses from, you guess it, the people who live and work in the neighbourhood.

Services: Typical again.  They don't smile much to you unless they recognize you as a frequent patron, then they chat you up."}
{"text":"TLDR: Typical Asian menu (congee, fried rice, fried noodle, side dishes, main dishes). Average price and mediocre service. Nothing spectacular to rave about. 

If you don't know where to go, and you're near by and craving some fried rice/congee/noodles, this is the place. It basically gives you what you want and tastes the same every time (the price just goes up every now and then :P). 

My family and I come here when we can't really think of a place to go, and want a quick meal. If you come on the weekends around 12-1, you're bound to have to wait for a spot. They also have a special: if you buy any dish over $7.95 before 3:00pm, you can get a hot drink free (add $1 for cold)."}
