{"text":"I've been to this place quite a few times, and it's a favorite with my family.  Food is pretty cheap, and their taco's are AWESOME!  Simple, americanized tacos.  Crispy shell, ground meat, lettuce, cheese and salsa, but better than you could imagine. You get 3 in a basket and I think it's like $5 or $6.   The fries, aren't my favorite though, as they are the crinkle cut fries, but they're fries, so I don't really give a crap, I still eat them.  I've never had the stromboli, but it's good.   In the bar part of the restaurant, you can also order food.  I usually get a mandarin (Absolut) and tonic and some tacos and sit at the bar and grub.  There's sports and random tv on....and they have a jukebox.  The people who work there are always friendly and get you what you want.  I've also had some really interesting conversations with people there....   I used to live in Silverado Ranch, literally a stumble away from T-Birds.  I was there one night until 8:30 am.  Talking, drinking and just enjoying myself.... So, all in all, I love T-Birds.  Good, cheap food, good, cheap drinks and a decent place to enjoy it in.    Also, check out the mural on the wall in the bar, the road is made entirely of spent beer bottle caps."}
{"text":"Best \"dive\" bar in town.  The bar food is amazing.  Besides the pizza most everything on the menu is great.  New tvs also.  Very friendly staff.  I'm just pissed they got rid of the ham stack which was my favorite sandwich there.  Bring it back!!  Oh..and the prices can't be beat."}
{"text":"Great menu options, drinks are well priced and service is always friendly at bar or in the restaurant. Been coming here for 3 years and I always order the deluxe grilled cheese it's heavenly and their frites are always perfectly done . Mmmmmm"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good, cheap breakfast then welcome to T-Bird Lounge.  I've had the omelet with home potatoes,  biscuits and gravy, NY steak and eggs with home potatoes ($6.50), and sausage/egg/cheese breakfast sandwich ($5) and it's all good.   Waitstaff is pleasant and the food comes out quicker than expected from the kitchen.    I've only dined in the lounge where children are welcome but they also have a 21+ bar area with gaming machines.  This place is open 24/7 and I thing my next stop here will be for some late night grub."}
{"text":"Went in today  to try a new place for breakfast. I had corn beef hash and eggs with sourdough.  I think my 9 year old could have made me a better breakfast. The only reason I have 2 stars instead of 1 is my daughters' lunch, mini burger w/fries, was decent according to her.  It's nothing fancy and the service was okay. They are pretty cheap, I guess you get what you pay for. Definitely won't be back. As cheap as it was, still not worth the money."}
{"text":"The chicken wings here are the best. I go there atleast once a week. The wait staff there are very friendly too."}
{"text":"We just randomly stopped for breakfast here.  It was really delicious! Julie was our server and she was really perfect."}
{"text":"The service is the only thing decent about this restaurant.  The food is mediocre at best.  You can't get real cream for the coffee, the butter is not real, it's a prepackaged conglomeration, probably margarine.  Nothing seems fresh, it tastes like they use packaged food (salad greens, etc.) and generic products, in an attempt to save money. It is so sad, because the food used to be pretty good. We used to go every Sunday for breakfast, but, no longer."}
{"text":"Rude waitress!!! Just driving by and got wings as a favor for my brother, he loves this place. I guess if your not buying beer and tipping your business isn't worth their time ."}
{"text":"Best pot roast I've tried!"}
{"text":"There are times the day is just so busy you don't want to cook dinner.  Great alternative...this place was fantastic!  Delicious food, great staff. Just moved to the neighborhood and will most certainly visit again."}
{"text":"Love the wings at this place they are cooked in the pizza oven . Super crispy .love their breakfast specials For lunch get the get the taco basket !! Service is always good . Food portions are great . Friendly wait staff and bartenders"}
{"text":"I've lived just a few miles from the T-Bird Lounge for years, and have never been inside till tonite.  It's not high-end, but it's not ugly, either. Not a dive-bar really, but definately not Ritzy. I had dinner there in the resturaunt-side, and can't really comment on the bar aspect of it.  I ordered the teriyaki wings, and they were excellent. T-Bird deep-fries, then sauces them, THEN puts them on the grill, to get even more crusty and slightlly charred. The teriyaki sauce  tasted homemade and was delicious.  The Stromboli of Doom was ordered by my MIL. She got the \"small\" size origional, and when it came out..I laughed like a hyena! It was HUGE! At least 5 pounds in weight, and the size of a school notebook. About 3 inches fat, it was just amazing! This \"small\" Stromboli can feed 3 or 4 people EASILY. The flavor is excellent, to match. Filled with pepperoni, salami, sausage and mozzerella cheese, it was VERY very filling! The dough around it was top-notch and light and flaky.  Service was very good. Attentitve and always with answers to lots of questions.  This is an ideal place to get simple food, prepared GREAT, for a cheap price. I'd highly reccommend it after going out after drinking/partying.  MUCH better than Village Pub or Goldfinger's. I have a new fave local place to go for great food! A huge bonus, they are a short block away from Neilsen's Frozen Custard, a perfect dessert after such a perfect meal!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite neighborhood breakfast joints since Shuck's closed.  Everything is good on the breakfast menu, except the Steak & Eggs Special (oddly enough).  The non-breakfast menu gets a little iffy.  The restaurant is less than a block from my place.  But I rarely went the first two years I lived here because the (non-breakfast) food was consistently mediocre.  So one time I talked to the waiter and told me everything on the menu besides the stromboli and wings was suspect.  How do you f@#k up a club sandwich.  The found a way.  The stromboli, however,  is a huge pillow of pizza deliciousness.  The wings are ok, depending on the sauce you choose.  I'd skip the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"How about adding some anchovies to your menu they're easy to cook and they're easy to get out of the can. Variety is the spice of life and it's good for business"}
{"text":"I didn't really like the restaurant at all. You walk in and it smells like cigarettes and you have just go wherever and I don't like that there should be someone taking you to a table and it took the waiter about 5ish minutes to get us menus and then once we wanted to order the lady was at the bar and she was acting like she had a million customers when it was my table and maybe 3 people at the bar.... the food wasn't great . So I pretty much paid them 60 bucks to make us sick! I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"My omelet was wrong and I ate my entire meal without a drink because the server, Valerie, did not bother to check back after delivering the food for accuracy or refills.  While the food here is usually good, the service always leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Wanted my first review to be a positive one, but I just can't see that here.   Went in last night 9pm. Been here before a few times last year. Had Meatloaf Special, Philly for son, Biscuits & Gravy to share as app and granddaughter ordered just fries. Viewing at the menu, I had to look around to see if I was dreaming! The prices are a bit crazy for the atmosphere and food quality. Meatloaf ($9.50) was 2 thin slices grilled, instant mash that was not stirred and was crusty on top, and water dunked vegetables that made the gravy on the meatloaf too thin. Philly ($10) was ok, but not a lot of meat. Biscuits & Gravy ($7) was ok. Two biscuits with sausage/white gravy. Gravy seemed powdered and it had exactly 4 little pieces of sausage in it. but all of the above is not the biggest issue..............  French Fries WERE $6.00..................  it was a decent normal size, BUT, at any other place they are $2.50-3.25. And NO, they were not cut fresh! They are the old school frozen crinkle cut that cost .40 cents a pound! Just because you put them in the Appetizer section and not the Sides section, YOU DOUBLE THE PRICE??? Nice try, but in my mind you drive people away by doing that.   Pizza price was raised as well. $15 for a small cheese. $18 for a large cheese...... No words for that. You have a seperate dining area for families, but for the same money, there are way too many other, better options for less $$$$  Perhaps the marketing/menu crew should visit Village Pub or Mulligan's to see what pricing and quality should be."}
{"text":"Used to really enjoy this place. Was here in late December for B'fast and came with family for B'fast again first week of Jan. '16.  New menu: T-Bird Breakfast Special up over 16%, Steak & Eggs up over 40%, B'fast for Seniors & kids  same as regular menu price.  No longer a place to go for people on fixed income. Should now be upgraded to $$ business"}
{"text":"Pretty good food for a gaming bar.  Beer selection could be better, but it's a nice place to stop in for a quick bite"}
{"text":"Best wings in town! We really like this spot for the wings and draught beer. We especially like the krinkle cut fries. Yummy..."}
{"text":"Food was great ...service fun....clean....cheap unbelievably cheap....i will come back everytime i come to vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"5 Stars for T-bird Lounge  T-bird Lounge is a local restaurant and tavern in the Silverado Ranch area. Growing up in Vegas it's always been a common stop for a quick affordable bite to eat. Whether you're looking for a family-friendly dinner, late night snack, or a great place to have a beer after work this is the place to go! The atmosphere is no fancy steak house but since the remodel the place has a great comfortable feel. The restaurant is all seat yourself and you're given a great variety of whether you want to be seated in a booth or a table. TV's are located around the whole restaurant and the bar area. During the holidays the staff always goes the extra mile to decorate the place and bring a little cheer to your experience there. They have a couple trophies won by their softball team hanging around the restaurant to add to the sense of community. With the new separation of the restaurant from the bar you can enjoy your dinner without the common Vegas problem of being surrounded by smokers.   The food available there for the price they offer is just unbeatable! With years of ordering their teriyaki chicken wings charbroiled under my belt, I can easily say they are the best you can find. Other places like Buffalo Wild Wings may offer more sauces to choose from but T-birds wings are not only more affordable but just so much more satisfying. If you're a fan of the hot stuff I dare you to give their hot wings a shot, if you don't like to sweat I'd stay far away from them. If you're planning on taking your kids out with you they have a great kid's meal options and some of the best chicken fingers you can ask for. Their chicken fingers are all white meat and the batter is fresh and crispy, you might even catch yourself stealing some from your kids. If you're feeding a huge party or just feeling mighty brave give one of their famous Stromboli's a shot. I must warn you though the portions are much more then you expect. It is nearly impossible to finish the large Stromboli even with five people in tow, be prepared for tons of leftovers!   Though I'm a stickler for their dinner and lunch items they also make a killer breakfast. If you're a lover of some good old southern cooking, their chicken fried steak is very tender and the gravy is creamy and a great compliment to the dish. I can't pass up adding a side of fluffy pancakes to whatever breakfast I do decide on. Breakfast is available at all hours of the day so for those of you who love some French toast for dinner your set. They also offer some healthier alternatives for those looking for a few less calories or working on their cholesterol such as oatmeal, fruit cups, and cottage cheese. Every once in a while I happen to go in for breakfast when one of the classic car groups are having a get together, such a great time seeing all the vintage cars in the parking lot!    No matter what you're ordering off the menu T-birds staff is there to make sure your experience is a great one. As soon as you are seated the staff is always right there to greet you no matter how busy it is. The restaurant is filled with regulars and don't be surprised if after a couple times of going there one of the waitresses remembers your name and even your order! Many times I've been personally greeted by the manager Mary Alice always curious of how you're enjoying your meal and if there's anything else she could do to better your time at T-birds. This courtesy isn't exclusive to just the restaurant side either the bartenders are always on the move and making sure you are taken care of at the bar. The swing shift bartender DJ is always on top of her job and your drink never gets a chance to run low even on a packed night. T-bird attracts a great group of regulars that add to the great feel of T-bird and you'll always hear laughter ringing through the place. The bar area also offers a selection of video poker and a separate area for pool and shuffle board for those who don't just like to sit around. T-birds also has the NFL football package so you can catch all of your games come Sunday.   All in all if you're looking for a cheap and tasty meal with the family or a great place to hang-out on your night off the T-bird is worth your time to check out. The restaurant offers a great environment suitable for bringing the entire family for a good bite to eat, a place for teens to meet up with their friends after a big high school football game, or an older couple to come in and get their usual. For the older crowd a bar to meet some new friends and share a couple drinks over good music and food. This place is much more than the PT's and Goldfinger's found on every corner in Las Vegas, T-bird Lounge is one of the local hidden treasures and that's what keeps me coming every time I'm back in town!"}
{"text":"Tried the Sunday Special chicken parmigiana & was very disappointed. Charred chicken with tomato sauce, no breading or cheese. Mixed vegetables were cold, but luckily not frozen.  My son's cheeseburger was good (or so he said).  Our first time here, guess you need to stick to the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Food Was actually not bad for a bar. Service was on point.  Recommend it if your looking for some late night grub and a cool bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"They have two dollar draft domestic beers, lots of screens.   Clean environment. The staff were nice.   Didn't order any food."}
{"text":"Not interesting enough to be a good dive bar and the food / bar selection wasn't good enough to warrant a repeat visit.   Went for some wings and beer on a Saturday evening. The wings were standard bar wings. They had that chicken skin smell a raw chicken has, although they were cooked through.  Probably just not super fresh. Draft Beer selection was a half notch above standard domestics with Blue Moon and Newcastle being the top shelf.  Waitress was cool and didn't fuss over us asking for a couple of extra ranch dressings.  The oddest dynamic of this bar / lounge was the crowd. It was primarily teenagers and 50ish bar fly's on the slots with a few families interspersed."}
{"text":"Best bartenders...especially Lynn and Michele....good food great happy hour specials and gaming promotions"}
{"text":"Went twice in the last two days. We ate at the bar the first time around 4p. Chicken wings were amazing! Fries good too. Came again for breakfast on Sunday around 1030a service was horrible but food was good."}
{"text":"So my sister and I stopped at this place to check it out because it was recommended by one of her friends who said they have the best hot wings in town. Unfortunately it was all bad!!! They're not all that, they're really dry and hard. If you want to get good hot wings you're better off just going to BWW!"}
{"text":"Awesome place big portions you could definitely share the small Stromboli. The staff is also very friendly."}
{"text":"I live in Southern Highlands so we came here when they first opened. It was nothing special. Decided to try it again, I have to say I was impressed. I tried the  Supreme Stromboli. Wow! Not only was it huge but it was tasty and the dough was cooked through. I also like how the dough on top was thinner than the bottom. The service was also friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"My dang appetizer took 6000000000000 minutes like bruh don't recommend coming here EVER!"}
{"text":"Stromboli...salami, ham, pepperoni and sausage! It's sooooo gooood and it is HUGE.!!!! This bar is in the middle of nowhere but it has a comfortable atmosphere. The menu looks good. Gaming machines are so so. The main reason I go here is for the stromboli. I'm sure you will like it."}
{"text":"Good and very reasonably priced food. Makes breakfast super easy on the weekends. Frequent customer. Very friendly and polite staff."}
{"text":"The wings are actually quite delicious. The size of the wings are larger than the usual wings you find at other bars. An order comes with 12 wings with the sauce of your choosing. Apparently the hot is REALLY HOT!   Hubby got bbq wings with the crinkle fries. We left with full bellies and a general satisfaction with the T-Birds chicken wing experience.  It gets a 3 / 5 stars from me due to atmosphere and slow service. An overall clean bar that was not full of smoke or lingering smells."}
{"text":"We ate there last night, the first time we've been back there in years.  I Had fish and chips, YUK, they were greasy and tasted about as good as frozen fish. The fries were not crisp. My husband had the hamburger. It was OK but nothing great. The atmosphere in the restaurant is bland. We won't go back"}
{"text":"You say bigger is not better ? That would be correct but this place hit on all cylinders when it comes to flavor ,quantity ,and most important to me is QUALITY ! T-Bird lounge now has several locations dotting The LV area, the original was on Trop but I found my home at the eastern and Silverado ranch location. breakfast are great beers cold 24/7 and the people are good as it get for Vegas. I hit home about once every couple years ( currently live in Texas) and this is the must eat Joint of all joints For this Cat. So weather it's a feast or just some Video Poker and wings give this place a try just old school Vegas at its best ! HOGGY OUT"}
{"text":"Will never go back I have food allergies and ask our server autumn if I could substitute a single item and was told no. I explained why I was asking and was told the owner is super strict and there was nothing she could do. I explained I was going to have to walk out and she said ok. I asked for the manager and upon talking to Tami (the manager) I was told there was nothing she could do and I told her I would be leaving and contacting them via email and giving them bad reviews she said ok and let me walk out.   Seems the staff would rather have you tell them about the allergy and then serve it to you so you can sue them.  Bj's across the street of much more accommodating and the service was much more professional."}
{"text":"2014 Update:  They have changed their Players Club...it's not so generous anymore. :(  So now their review loses a star.  I still continue to come here, just not as often as I used to.  I am not as happy with their new system, I miss the old one and the wheel spin.  Still good food and great staff.   Original Post:  In a town with many local bar choices, this is one of my favorite local hangouts.  Even though I I am typically there during the graveyard shift.  I think that have one of the best chicken fried steak and eggs in town.  Their pizza is also very thick, generously proportioned, and delicious.    Friendly graveyard bartenders (Jason and Charles) and their large menu is available 24/7.  I have been regularly going there for a few years now and have been known to put a few bucks in the machines, so I can also attest that they are very generous with their players club for regular players, just this month I received $400 in vouchers!"}
{"text":"First a couple of qualifying statements. I've been to too many wing spots to count. If you look thru the history, it's a fair selection across the USA.  This was my second attempt at finding a wing spot in sin city. I did NOT have high hopes based on my Yelp selections. This place is a smokin hot treasure. I was treated to a wing foursome thanks to Erica. I had traditional hot buffalo, grilled BBQ & teriyaki And the amazing sweet Thai finished in the pizza oven. All are deep fried but finished in separate fashion. They are allowed to caramelize & are so crispy & delicious,  I may actually start eating again, while typing this review.   Another great (and quite shameful) fact. I only finished 15 wings. Based on my 'normal' consumption (for testing purposes only) is around 20. These babies are HUGE.  Everyone who came in she knew by name & even remembered previous orders.  Erica & T-Bird Lounge make it to the Hall of Fame. GO THERE NOW FOR WINGS.  Beer selection solid with cold glasses. Epic!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food! Breakfast is awesome, highly recommend the cottage fries (only served until noon). If you are looking for a good burger come here."}
{"text":"Classic American diner menu, with big muted TVs all over. I can't believe how quickly my Reuben & o-rings came, like under 4 minutes from the moment I ordered. Very attentive staff. Bass on tap. Full food menu at 11pm on a Sunday night. What a great place."}
{"text":"Best Chicken Wings in Vegas !!! Medium are just right not to spicy and not to blend. And teriyaki wings are also really good, make sure when you order get hot wings chard, and teriyaki pizza oven, trust me you will not be disappointed, A bucket of wings (around 35 wings) and two cokes for about 25.00 is not bad."}
{"text":"Hmmmmmmm... this place is exactly what you would expect. Heavily smoke filled dark bar area filled with people who are definitely frequent customers. The service was good. It is a typical bar menu (fried food, pizza, nachos) Not sure if there is happy hour as we came around 9pm. Ordered a chicken Caesar salad and it was mediocre. The side garlic bread was the star of the show."}
{"text":"Solid fun place looks good on outside and inn I just recently relocated to this side of town and was not sure about this place but after always driving by decided to make a stop and it was well worth it the staff was very friendly and service was excellent cold mugs of beer and the chicken fried steak I recommend trying. I will be there again soon"}
{"text":"Stopped for a late lunch on Saturday & had the Tuna Melt. Spent all day Sunday with food poisoning. Will never go back."}
{"text":"The bartender on Saturday, an older woman with brown hair, is the worst. I had to go to her every time for a refill and to notify her of a spin bonus. I appeared to bother her as she talked to \"regulars.\"  I've been a bartender and when everyone leaves and there's one person left in the bar, the customer should never have to chase down the bartender to ask for a drink."}
{"text":"Great place for a happy hour. Service can be slow @ times. Stromboli is the best."}
{"text":"Good bar games. Great menu and fast services.  Have fun and time how long it takes for the host to get your food order whwn your menu is placed on end. Favorite: cheese steak and shrimp baskets. Negative: could not make a players card due to computer keyboard broke"}
{"text":"I ordered the wings and Stromboli, can't go wrong with the wings. Stromboli is way too big! A small is enough for 2 people."}
{"text":"I dropped a star from an old review because now they have increased their prices and their strombolis are overpriced."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the bar at T-Birds. I've only even been to T-Birds no more than 3 times in my life. So the whole experience was fresh for me. Monday night football. Cowboys and Redskins. I'm watching it as I type this. (Yes I'm at the bar writing this review). The women tending the bar are very nice and friendly. That was my first impression. The next thing that impressed me was the $2.50 bud light happy hour. One of the quickest beers I've been served. Went with the \"Surf & Turf\" - steak, fried shrimp, potatoes/fries, Texas toast, coleslaw. Food took a good amount of time to cook but the huge tv screen right in front me of me with the game playing distracted my stomach for the most part. Food finally arrived, and let me tell you it was delicious. They cooked the steak perfectly medium rare like I like it and shrimp were on point. I went with french fries cause I was already craving them before dinner. They have the thick waffle fries  and are bomb. the only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because the little food table/tray that slides along the bar that you eat on isn't very sturdy and when I was cutting my steak the plate would spin because the tray and wobbling like crazy. That and the fact that there's very limited eating space, given I have a big plate, a beer, a side plate with Texas toast, and another little bowl with coleslaw... I didn't have enough room for everything. The video slots affected that the most. Other than that, great experience, would come here every Monday during football season."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite bars! When I've got a few dollars to spare and want bar food, this is where I go. Domestic bottles are priced around $2.50 if I remember correctly and their Reuben sandwich is made just the way I like it!  Mon-Thurs the Hawaiian bartender (Pono is his name I think?) is there. He's really courteous and has yet to let me go more than a minute without a cold beer.  Also, had the stromboli the other night. It was HUGE. Had to be atleast 6\" wide and 12\" long, and that's the *small*. Ended up splitting it with a friend it was so big."}
{"text":"What can I say? We love our T-Birds! Friendly staff, cheap drinks, and awesome bar food! Never crowded and you can always count on catching pretty much any game you're looking for there. Try one of their daily specials, the fish and chips, or breakfast!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for wings and wings is what I got.  Not sure what else to say.  They weren't anything special, just wings.  Kind of on the small side. ($8.25 for a dozen and side of fries.)"}
{"text":"What can i say but ohh yummm! We'd been here a number of years before and it definately didnt disappoint. The syromboli was huge and excellant, stuffed with just so much meat. My Sister and i shared a small one and still only ate half. Mom wad contrary and wanted french toast which was also excellant. The waitress was great and didnt steer us wrong. The place isnt fancy but the food is hard to beat!"}
{"text":"Tbird LOVES their locals, what more can I say? They have amazing food specials, a comfortable atmosphere, a come as you are mentality, and they just want to see you have a fun time playing their loose slots or enjoying a fabulous beverage served by Lisa, the best bartender west of the Mississippi. Funny, beautiful, smart, and hard working. A truly amazing woman.  Hungry? Ask for Erica, the sweetest waitress who always smiles and can chat with you like you've been old friends for years.  This place has it all, but wait...there's Lottabucks! Simply sign up for a players card, gamble, pick five numbers, and every hour you're spinning down the race track at your chance at $100,000! You never win it, but sometimes you can grab 15 bucks in free slot play.  The best part? Cleopatra Keno and double up poker machines. Put this all together and you have the quintessential amalgamation of a true locals hotspot. Keep on keepin on Tbird!"}
{"text":"Bar and grill here good, staff friendly quick with drinks  is plus. Happened to stop on st. Patricks DAY they  slammed but gotten drinks quickly and drinks inexpensive.  Like sports have huge tv nice chairs sit in.   Will be going back soon ncaa tournament. Good local bar in Vegas."}
{"text":"CMON T-BIRD, YOU BETTER WORK!!!! So.... I basically like this place I have a couple legitimate complaints that will need to addressed before I commit to it being my football bar for the year. First off, the well drinks are weak as shit and I always have to buy an extra shot to make the drink an adult beverage. The other thing is the captioning on the sports are ridiculous, on NASCAR the words are at the top not interrupting the race, on football the damn caption is right in the middle of the screen, cmon! They have to get it together."}
{"text":"I also forgot to reiterate the greatness of the wings.   Why go to Buffalo Wild Wings when you can go to T-Bird? The two aren't even comparable. I will choose T-bird for their 12 wings + fries at $8.25 over BWW any day of the week. And yes, that also includes Tuesdays.  Save your taste buds for T-bird. Don't settle for less."}
{"text":"Back in the day (1990's), the T-Bird on Tropicana was a good spot. When the T-Bird opened on South Eastern years later, it was a nice addition to the neighborhood.   Pro's: They still have the same menu; Food quality is still decent; Wait staff is generally pleasant; Juke box and billiard options are a nice touch; Prices are reasonable.   Cons: Often times (late at night), the bartender is the server and (although generally friendly), it feels like diners are \"in the way\" of bar ops. The bartenders during the Day and Swing hours do not seem overly friendly - to say the least. The atmosphere is not as \"cozy\" as the Tropicana location used to be (and perhaps still is).   Still, I do make the trip to this place every now and then for a late night snack or sometimes an early morning coffee & omelets before a flight out of town.   Overall review: 3 stars."}
{"text":"1 star is too many. We live 20 minutes away placed a carry out order. After we arrived home discovered it was wrong. We called to get it fixed and hopefully some compensation. When we returned the correct order had not even been started yet and the gentleman who was filling our order had to twist the manager's arm just to get a small portion of the order refunded. Terrible customer service on the part of the manager."}
{"text":"I grew up going to T Bird and have seen it slowly evolve into what it is today. I would feel bad giving it anything less than four stars because it has been a favorite place of mine for many years, up until recently. Along with the new menus came a large jump in the prices. Now I love almost everything else about this place from the genuine, kind hearted servers, to the warm dimly lit ambiance. The food is your classic diner food selection but it comes in generous serving sizes. However It's when you start paying 11+ dollars on diner food plus the extra they charge you now for adding things that it becomes a problem."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Melissa!!! She's amazing!!! We only come here to see her, even though the stationary bar stools are the worst EVER. Seriously though, my friend is 6'8\" and his knees are smashed into the bar, and I'm 5' and can't reach my food without sliding forward onto the edge of the seat. Please please please put the comfortable bar stools around the rest of the place at the bar! We would stay so much longer (and spend so much more money!)"}
{"text":"Great bar. Not too many people on Sunday or Monday night for football. Yummy food. (Their boneless wings and BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger are to die for!) The bartender was really friendly and made fantastic drinks."}
{"text":"Dinner last nite was great. If you want some  awesome wings try T-Birds. Very friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"Got the \"small\" Original Stromboli....it good but I should have ask to take the pepperoni out (hate it, my fault...oh well). And onion ring which is good. The place is dim-lighted. They got a alcohol bar if you're looking to get drunk or just drink. Even got the tv screen but the wi-fi is blocked."}
{"text":"The best wings I've ever had! Love them charred and dip them in their blue cheese and ranch dressing mixed. Love this place! Hands down best place for wings!"}
{"text":"They have very hot wings and ice cold beer. Service was a little slow and bar was smokey."}
{"text":"This is actually an above average T-Bird location. It's kinda divey. The beer offerings are really meh. But the bartenders are friendly and attentive. And the food seems to be tastier here. It doesn't get too loud or crowded either. So if you've gotta hang out a T-Bird, this location is one of the better options."}
{"text":"It's a neighborhood lounge. Kind of dive-y. Definitely not clean and pristine. Ok beer offerings. Lots of options on the food menu. Breakfast is served 24 hours a day. Friendly staff. They have pool, a jukebox, etc.  Since everyone talks about their wings, I had to give those a try. I had the hot wings and the sweet chili wings. Wings themselves were of ok quality. They definitely could've cooked for longer. The hot ones had a nice flavor. The sweet chili ones were too Asian / too much like a sweet and sour sauce for my liking. The wings were served with bland, almost icky ranch. So overall, 2.5 to 3 star wings."}
{"text":"probably the WORST bar i've ever been to, this place thoroughly STINKS.   the bartender had a look on his face like he swallowed a fly. he saunters over to me, i tell him what i want (a Malibu 7, but what other kinds of Malibu Rum do they have?). 5 minutes later he comes back. they only have one kind, so i order it. 5 minutes later, he shuffles back, takes my money, and 5 minutes later, he stumbles back and while he's looking away from me, lays down my change and walks off. scumbag. no tip for you, LOSER! never again will i dirty the bottom of my shoes in this crap-hole.   P.S. there was hardly anyone in there. no doubt this fly-eating slug scared them all away."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the mood for chicken wings I always come here. They have a bucket of wings for $22 and it's more then enough for me and my man to share. The wings are BIG, they dont give you the little ones that barely have any meat. These are chicken wings on steriods lol. I always get the wings plain, extra crispy, with sauce on the side. I like their teriyaki and hot sauce. The hot sauce is very hot though, it has peppers in it. If you dont like hot I would suggest getting mild.   On my last visit I wanted breakfast, so I ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs. It was filling, but it was definitely not the best CFS I have had. The gravy was not homemade and you could tell it was from a powder. Not good. I was busy chatting with my boyfriend and our server, Chris, who was very attentive, and by the time I went to eat some of the CFS, the gravy was gummy and sticky. It was not appetizing at all. I decided to scrape most of the gravy off and just use hot sauce, but it was quite disappointing. My meal came with cottage fries, which is like fried potatoes that are crusty and delicious, and toast. I would advise against ordering the CFS, but the wings are for sure a winner!"}
{"text":"I go here mostly to watch the away Rebel's games. They usually already have the game playing, and even if they don't, they are more than happy to change the channel for you. They have game day specials if you wear Rebel red, and also NFL specials.   Service has always been great. Friendly faces. Fast service. Good small talk.  As far as the food goes, it's pretty typical of what you would get at any other bar. They do offer a few late night specials, such as my personal favorite, steak and eggs for 6.99. When I'm too lazy to drive all the way to Southpoint, TBirds is my main place to go for some cheap steak and eggs.   Overall, a good bar. It's never really too crowded, at least when I go. I think I've started going enough recently that they're finally starting to recognize me, which is always a good thing."}
{"text":"with our favorite waitress. Mary!!!  you lady! Fried pickles! bomb! by the way, Friday may 8th they are having a celebration of being open 10years Mexican food buffet ! 6pm to 9 pm come and enjoy! see you there !"}
{"text":"I always drop in here when I am getting work done on my car next door. Nothing fancy, just good old fashioned American breakfast at a good price. The wait staff are always friendly and professional and the food arrives fairly quickly."}
{"text":"Service was good but food was disappointing. We always go to s eastern location n always leave very satisfied. Today we tried this one thinking it would be comparable but it wasn't meant to be. I ordered biscuits n gravy gf ordered one pancake n side of over med eggs. Pancake came out first with mine. First look of mine n my gf said those looked they were microwaved. I thought they looked like they came out of box very flat and NO SAUSAGE in the gravy. They ended up being cold so I sent them back. My gf eggs finally came out they were terribly under cooked so they went back. Anyway server was gracious we will stick to our SE location as they obviously have a better cook."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my mom this Sunday and service was great but food subpar. The steak sandwich had a bunch of gristle and the burger I had was not hot & not seasoned. The location on Eastern has better quality food but I've been coming to T-Birds since they're first location by tbe dollar movie theater when I was a kid. I'm not as happy with this one."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  T bird is the place to go to enjoy some good old fashioned shuffle board.  Our waitress was very nice and friendly. She even recommended the fried ice cream, which was good but it's not fried ice cream. It's more like a donut filled ice cream. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed it but the name isn't fitting.   This place would have been four stars but the set up is uncomfortable. It's too bright inside and there's three different areas that make it awkward. Our waitress couldn't really see us and how we were doing. The shuffle board pool table area is higher and hidden. Then the diner area is hidden as well by the entrance on the left. T birds would make a killing if it had some new decor. Jason and I actually discussed it while playing shuffle board. The wall has an old car and there's a few old cars elsewhere. T birds could make this place less 1960 old diner feeling into a sexy 2000 girls on top of classic cars feeling. Just saying. Maybe make the walls darker, dim the lights and change the booths by the pool table to bar stools. Lastly, seeing the extra paper goods above the locker type wall cabinets just looked unprofessional.   T birds has so much potential."}
{"text":"Nice place to eat with a large menu.  Have never had any complaints.  Prices are pretty decent as well."}
{"text":"Eating here once with a buddy for lunch. I didn't know what to expect but we tried it out. I had the lunch special open faced roast beef sandwich and it was actually pretty good. The meat was a little tough but other than that it was good and the cost was reasonable. The waitress was nice the restaurant was clean and the service was prompt I will eat here again."}
{"text":"This place is so great. Always very chill and relaxing to come to with the nicest bartenders, especially Lisa! I don't even have to worry about creepers creeping either ;)  They have a 24 hour menu so you can get your fat on anytime of the day. Plus a dining room area so Hunnie Bunnie can come and chill too :) Super convenient that it's right across the street from the crib too so it's a short walk away!  And TV's to catch your favorite sports."}
{"text":"Average. The food came out after 5 minutes of ordering so I'm pretty sure it was microwaved. The vibe is off- almost like the people that were there are ALWAYS there. I kind of felt in the twilight zone or in one of those movies like the couple never seen again.  Waitress was nice but a little jerky. She couldn't stand still. Probably won't come back. Not what I was expecting when I googled bar food."}
{"text":"There is only 1 reason I come to T Birds and that's to eat there special Stromboli!  This is the only place that I go too when I'm feeling super hungry for Stromboli! I made the mistake the 1st time by ordering a large and boy was that the biggest Stromboli I seen.  There Small can feed 4 people easily and that's what I order ever since.   The restaurant is nicely separated from the bar and completely smoke free.  There are TV's in the area so you can watch your sports game during your lunch or dinner.  They have a large menu ranging from simple appetizers to full course Surf and Turf meals.  The Stromboli is obviously my favorite.  The establishment is really clean and the staff is really friendly.  It doesn't get that busy so service is always there to fill your drinks.    They have a full bar so you can order any drink you want.  Gaming is also available here."}
{"text":"My brother in law and I decided to give this place a try one afternoon for lunch. Initial appearance inside is ok, they do have a separate area for non smokers and the bar is big with brand new big screen TVs.   The Stella beer that we had was very cold and nice my gripe right away was when I tried to move the bar stool closer to the bar....its screwed to the floor !  Why ? We ordered the cheese nachos, French fries, fried mushrooms and a large Stromboli (to go). The food was quick to arrive and the portions were huge, a order or fries must have been a 1lb or potatoes, the mushrooms were the same, no kidding about 25 breaded dried mushrooms piping hot.  The nachos were also huge, but after digging into them from the top, you soon realize that underneath the cheese, sour cream and guacamole, all you have is bare nachos. The Stromboli arrived and when I say it was two foot long I was probably underestimating, it must have weighed 4lbs and was enough to feed 10.   I didn't get a chance to eat the Stromboli but my brother in law said it was ok, a little salty but not bad. If you want a ice cold beer and huge food portions this is your place, I did feel that the place caters to the elder generation, ( just by who was there when we where there). Overall not a bad place, I'd give it another try but it won't take me away from other bars in the area."}
{"text":"been going here for a few years now..we had a great server the other day Madison. She was very pleasant and attentive. We usually get the same few things so no big disappointments. The breakfast is good and reasonable. I do think its odd that their breakfast sandwich doesn't come with cheese (its extra). The other day we went and my husband asked for no meat, but to add cheese. I thought since he wasn't getting the bacon which it came with they wouldn't charge for the cheese, but they did. They also have good Stromboli and chicken wings."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Great bar food at an awesome price (especially the daily specials!!!). The first time the bartender was not so friendly and very sloooooow. The second time it was slightly the same especially since they had forgotten all about my food!!!! Yet again it was during a shift change and Brandy (the next bartender on duty) turned my experience around. She was very friendly and fun. My boyfriend and I tried the small supreme stromboli which can easily feed 4 people! and the fried mushrooms. If you're looking for good prices and trying to lay low then definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"It is what it is - a typical bar with typical bar food.  I've never had a bad meal here and the prices are average for this type of food.  They have a regular waitress who's been there since I've been working in the area (2 yrs) so its nice to see the same face every time I go."}
{"text":"This bar had a separate bar and restaurant.  The food was awesome with fresh ingredients.  Our server she was so nice and on point... I will be back again!"}
{"text":"5 stars for a locals bar?   I only reviewing the hot wings.  Honestly the best in Vegas.  I've had wings a lot of bars, restaurants, and wings places and so far the best.  I think their sauce is scratch made because little flakes of pepper and seeds.  It's got the right tang and heat and always cooked to perfection.  Nothing worse than soggy skin and the wings are big and meaty, unlike some shitty chain, that will remain nameless(who I think has the worst wings).  Beer prices are good and it's nice quiet place to unwind and have a drink. Never crowded.  This is definitely my spot for wings, and it's open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last week and had a blast! We didn't try the food (besides the veggie platter which was nice and fresh) but the drinks were cold and environment was warm. Everyone that was employed there was unbelievably nice from the swing bartender and server to the graveyard bartender that came on. Everyone took great care of us and was so friendly! I will certainly be back to visit these folks!"}
{"text":"Where to go for an early dinner on a Saturday Christmas Eve?  ...that wouldn't be crazy busy and has good food?  T-bird Lounge & Restaurant on Blue Diamond fits the bill.  A nice 16oz. Steak dinner with coleslaw, baked potato and Texas toast, plus a side of fried mushrooms.  Jason gave great service and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I Love this place. Best wings in town. I can see raising prices a little after new years but OMG. Prices went way up there. Looked at new menus and left. Wont pay those prices. Way too much!! Sorry. We will miss you!"}
{"text":"Finished breakfast with the 2 egg special. Everything was delicious, generous, and prepared as requested: potatoes crispy, eggs over easy just right. For Vegas the price was really good 7.25. Would come here again for sure."}
{"text":"I love T-Bird! The service from Erica the blonde bartender and Lisa the waitress is always great! They always make you feel right at home. I've never had Lisa make a mistake on my order and the food and drink prices are very competitive. They both deserve a raise. I wish they had a better happy hour, or maybe I don't, I don't need to be spending more time here lol. Love the T-Bird!"}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend for some late night grubbin. I just drove to Vegas from California. It was late, and I was starving! We decided to dine here because we always pass it when going to my house and the beaming neon sign told us it was open.    When we first walked in, we didn't see anybody. There was no one that greeted us, not even anyone at the bar. We figured they must be closing, so we walked out. As we were getting into our car, the bartender ran out and asked us if we were trying to eat there. We said yes and he told us to come in and that he was just in the back when we walked in.   They serve breakfast from 10pm-noon and the prices range from $3.25 (oatmeal) to $6.50 (steak and eggs). We already knew we wanted steak and eggs, so we ordered it right away. It's a pretty good deal. You get a 7 oz. New York steak served with two eggs, cottage fries and toast for only $6.50.   As we waited for our meals, we perused through the menu. There's about 10 items on the breakfast menu including country fried steak, steak n eggs, hot cakes, build your own omelet, biscuits n gravy, oatmeal, a breakfast special with 2 eggs/your choice of meat/toast/cottage fries, french toast, and a protein plate. It pretty much has everything you need for a great breakfast and for cheap!  We got our dishes. They were decently portioned and the meat was well cooked and tender. I really enjoyed the cottage fries with some ketchup and the eggs were nice and fluffy.   This is a great place for some cheap breakfast or a late night bite!"}
{"text":"i think this is my new favorite bar. they have great food and super cool servers. the last couple times i've been i got the hot chicken fingers and fries. only thing i need more of is the ranch! the server we had last time was really cool. she back talked to my brother which i thought was hilarious and then came and check on us ever so often. we then decided to play shuffle board which was the awesomest idea ever! the place isn't usually packed when we go but i'm sure during the weekends it gets busier. darn, now i want chicken!!"}
{"text":"A top location for breakfast - ample portions and good home fries, the breakfast steak & eggs is a treat and inexpensive. Lunch specials are varied and an excellent value. The burgers are first-class - huge and very tasty, best part is the multiple side choices, you are not limited to fries only, I love the side salad option. If you try any of the sandwiches you won't be disappointed here either .  Have not yet been there for dinner but if it is as good as breakfast and lunch it will be a filling treat at a great price. Basic dinner decor, nothing fancy, excellent servers. The restaurant is separate from the bar."}
{"text":"The food here does not exactly stand out to me as \"delicious and unforgettable\" however, the restaurant is pretty much across the street from where I live. The breakfast is very typical of what you could make at home. The restaurant is dimly lit so it great for hangover mornings. The service is usually pretty outstanding. The staff is very attentive and quick to bring you anything you want. They've even got jokes."}
{"text":"NEW YORK STEAK & EGGS  7 oz. New York steak served with two eggs, cottage fries and toast.  Wait. for ONLY $6.50???? oh my god! I'M SOLD! Soo yummy!!   Served from 10PM to Noon Everyday!!"}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood bar and grill. Great place to hang out with friends or just get out with your honey. The drinks are great, great bar tender and great food! The bbq wings are so good. And u must try try the fried ice cream. It is to die for! They also have shuffle board which is so fun. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not far from home and very excellent breakfast!  I was alone so decided on a Sunday morning to eat in the bar. Greeted immediately by the bar tender and ordered an omelet. Wow for $7.50 you get a huge omelet, big helping of homemade cottage potatoes and toast. $3 buck less than Ihop. Very clean inside and not smoky at all. 5 Stars and I will return to try the wings and stromboli everyone makes mention of on Yelp."}
{"text":"This is my routine weekend stop.  I've been coming here for a couple years and I enjoy the way the wait staff recognizes and welcomes us. It is similar to a small town diner. The chicken fried steak breakfast is some of the best I ever had. The T Bird never dissapoints. The beautiful red head bartender Jen makes the best bloody Mary in southern Nevada. I have done my research and tested many across the state. The stromboli is epic and taste better each day you retrieve the leftovers from your fridge. The stromboli  Is humungeous and perfect for splitting amongst some friends.  I've never had a bad meal or experience here. It's well worth stopping by for whatever you fancy."}
{"text":"Monday 4/13/15  4:08pm  I love the way this place is closed off from the bar area.  I don't suggestion bringing a baby or toddler in here because it's STILL smokey.     Monday is Pot roast day (our favorite)! We sit at our favorite table and order our drinks and food.  It came out hot, well seasoned, & very little fat. The veggies took on much of the flavor, yuummm! Coffee as always light mild roasted Folgers. 1 Irish creamer, 1 creamer and two sugars for me.    They have specials & coupons on their \"T-birdlounge\" app.  They have their own rewards for $10 off SIXTH purchase of $20, buy 10 Strombolis get ONE free, buy 10 burgers get ONE free, or Senior's deal $5 off a $10 visit.  Also I see they are partners with Shell Fuel Rewards Network  dine in points too.   You save a bit if you frequent regular here, you link your payment method to shell FRN account. Each time you use that payment method here you're building towards earning 10 even 25 cent off a gallon of gas."}
{"text":"I came to play video blackjack. I've got ten bucks on the line with a 7,4 showing I click double down. The machine registers stand. I lose my money. I tell the bartender. He doesn't care.   Don't game here. Their machines are jacked up and no one who works here gives a shit."}
{"text":"It's always awesome customer service is amazing I've been going there at eastern since the opened, the wings are spot on the best in town.... Their ranch and blue cheese dressing is magic!.... Stromboli is the bomb but bring friends if you don't want leftovers for three days, don't get the large!.... Burgers are custom to taste anything goes!.... You can't bite a dbl unless your jaw detaches.....  24/7-365 happy hour is the best!....."}
{"text":"Pool, shuffleboard, video poker. Laid back locals bar. Nice bartender on Wednesday and Thursday."}
{"text":"My child and I walked in right behind a group of three...there was two guys at another  table and that was it,  not busy at all. Waitress takes their order and disappeared. So now we are around the 15 min mark and she has not even acknowledged that were there. A man walks in and sits down. The waitress brings a drink to one of the tables then looks at my son and I and waves, she then turns around and takes the drink order of the guy that came in 15 min after we did. We get up to leave and another employee comes up to ask why we are leaving I explained why and she shook her head and stated she would get her manager, I told her thanks but no need then the waitress comes up to her in front of us and asks \"What's wrong.\" Really lady? Horrible......"}
{"text":"Always delicious and consistent! My favorite go to food is their BLT on lightly toasted rye, side of potato salad and a cup of soup. The bacon is always perfectly crisp.  The sandwich always stays together, makes it all the way to my home 20 minutes away and never turns soggy! The homemade potato salad is excellent. Sunday is Italian Wedding Soup that is consistently good too. Good food and you won't go broke eating at T-Birds either."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the last 2+ years and I've always been really satisfied! Good food, affordable prices and really friendly service! I love that they are open 24/7 and offer a nice selection of beers that aren't over priced either!  I'd highly recommend this place and I'll be sure to visit again soon."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great wings, with a sauce that can clear your nasal passages but not too harsh! Caramel chocolate pie is addictive!"}
{"text":"My friends an I decided to check out T-Bird in the hopes of finding some good late night specials and happy hour. Too our surprise this establishment offers neither.  Coming in, the place was virtually empty, maybe two or three other people at the bar. The lounge/bar is pretty typical: large bar with plenty of seats, video poker, pool tables tucked away in the corner and a couple of high tops/booths.   We seated ourselves and the bartender quickly handed us our menus. The menu here is huge, about 4 or 5 pages, with at-least 10 different kinds of burgers/sandwiches, pizzas, and plenty of appetizers. I was surprised to learn that they didn't have any late night food or drink specials. The bartender didn't really have any recommendations so we ended up ordering some nachos and chicken fingers with fries.   The nachos were OK at best. For whatever reason the cook decided to heap on extra olives and douse the whole dish with sour cream. The chicken fingers and fries were pretty good but at ~$10 I expected more. For the price, I could gotten better food at BJ's or Yard House.   The experience was pretty average, nothing memorable. There are better spots in the area worth checking out."}
{"text":"The bucket of chicken wings are always on point. Extra crispy and put them in the pizza oven. The waitress is always helpful and sweet. Don't get wings a lot. But when I do it's T-Birds. Never lets me down."}
{"text":"Good food for a great price! Good service and great friends! Love the chicken wings well done ! My fave!"}
{"text":"Just had midnight breakfast steak and eggs with my sister and mom who had fish and chips. Our first time here. Bartender Charles had great customer service he was funny and very welcoming! Food was great we will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast, it's cheap and actually pretty good. I've been going here for many years, I like the fact that after you have been there a few times the waitress remember what your drink order is every time. It's kind of like cheers, it's a place for regulars, a place close to home. It is a cozy and inviting place and that is what makes it worth going in my opinion. The coffee is pretty good too, I like that Irish cream coffee cream is available. It's the little things I appreciate in a place."}
{"text":"It's an okay place to go for breakfast. Rather inexpensive. The corned beef hash and eggs were only $5.95 as of 11-21-15. The service was good.  Decided to come here since there was a long wait at Crepe Expectations across the street. I thought it would be a bit cuter inside with Southwestern colors and pictures of Thunderbird \"birds\" inside. Just a few pictures of Thunderbird cars inside."}
{"text":"My wife and I attended an organized party at The T-Bird Lounge on Eastern.  Mary Alice and her staff were great hosts and Hostesses. We were immediately greeted with a smile and made to feel comfortable.  The food spread was fajitas and fixins'. The food was hot and tasty. Our drinks were cold and filled quickly when they got close to empty!  There are pool tables and video games available. As well as slot play!  We would certainly return to The T-Bird. We would recommend that you give it a try as well!"}
{"text":"It's you friendly neighborhood good grub and cheap drinks bar. 5 star service. Always great drink specials available."}
{"text":"Cool neighborhood bar. Lots of big screen tvs and cheap food and drink specials during games. The highlight is definitely the icey cold draft beers...so cold and delicious!! Also the service was great...thank you Rachael!"}
{"text":"Been going to the T Bird on eastern for 15 years, Went to the original one on trop years before. when they had a burger for a buck. (really miss them days) Food is good for the price. service is great. A must if you live near 215 and eastern."}
{"text":"5 stars for the upgrade to flat screen tvs! Great for watching the game which we did last Sunday. The service though, was below par. The bar tender gave me a menu after waving her down and instructor me to set it upright if I when I'm ready. I did just that but after ten minutes I had to wave someone else down and it was clear that they were just busy. Very forgivable.  When my hamburger came I wasn't asked if I would like any ketchup or mustard, no mayo in sight. So I waved someone down again but I began feeling like such a pain. I asked for utensils and napkins while I had her and the burger was great. My side salad was huge and tasty as well. Without needing to wave anyone down though I was given my bill while eating and she came to retrieve it while I was still eating and was supposed that I hadn't put the card in there yet. Feeling a little rushed and again they seemed busy and she must have been trying to get home with cashing me out but I didn't really like feeling rushed after I was the one waiting most of the time."}
{"text":"I know .. Your thinking...Who rates a bar???  This is a local hang out... The bartender DJ is so wonderful!  She calls you by name, remembers your beverage and service is excellent!  The menu is well thought out... The food is kinda bland... But the portions are huge!!  This review was for the T-birds off Eastern.."}
{"text":"By far one of the best little hidden bars.  DJ the bartender has been there for years!  She is social, remembers your name and beverage of choice.  Bar menu is yummy, be sore to try the grinder or the wigs!!!! Keep in mind it is a bar so it can get kinda noisy."}
{"text":"We love T-Bird!  It's a great place to eat with our toddler.  Service has always been great, food is cheap and comes out quick.  When we don't have a plan to go anywhere else, we always go to T-Bird."}
{"text":"I love  their wings.  I love a good steak  sandwich or French dip.  We will go for dinner and watch sports. Good prices, nothing fancy, good service, good food.  We like that they have a restaurant side so we avoid the  bar side, just preference for us."}
{"text":"We have been here previously and had pleasant experiences, but that was not the case today. I ordered one of their T Bird Smash drinks. It was listed at $5 on the menu. When I ordered, the person serving us said they weren't sure how to make it... Because they were \"just\" the manager. The ingredients were simple- grape vodka, soda, sprite, and a splash of chambord- so I said I wouldn't be too picky. It came out really strong, but I could deal with it. I was surprised, however, that a manager would not know how to make a signature drink. My husband ordered a Blue Moon and we got some potato skins to share. He put $20 in the machine and we settled in. Service was a bit neglectful; we had to pile our dishes and flag the manager down to get our bill. It was not very busy, either. There was one other patron at the bar.   Our bill was confusing to say the least. I was charged $5.75 for my $5 drink. There was a mysterious charge for 3x $0.25. And my husband was charged for his beer despite playing $20. We paid and left- no goodbye or thank you from anyone.   It's a shame because I'd liked the T Bird prior to today, and we live nearby. We will be voting with our money, though. Bars like this are a dime a dozen in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is great.  No matter how busy or empty the place my be, the service is always good.  The food is excellent for what its meant to be...Bar food at a good price and lots of it!  Some of my favorites include the Chicken Wings.  These suckers and big and if requested you can get an equally big side of Ranch or Bleu Cheese for a nominal charge.  Be sure to order them charred for an experience most wing joints don't offer.    The  large Stromboli is also probably the biggest dish offered in Las Vegas.  I seriously can't think of any single order here in town that you can get bigger.  T-Bird should have a challenge for anyone who can eat a large one and Man vs. Food should do a piece on it as well.  It's that big!  Not only that, it is also tasty and at a very reasonable price.    Finally, I really like the chili here.  It's nothing fancy but it does the job as chili should.  Hearty and delicious!  Be sure to order it with cheese and onions.  I always get this as an appetizer.    If you haven't tried T-Bird, be sure it give it a go.  It's been here forever and for good reason!"}
{"text":"The other T-Birds are great, but the staff at this one makes it not so much fun. For me this isn't good as they are right across the street from my house. It seems that if you aren't a cop in here to get free food or old and crusty you are second class. The food also isn't nearly as good as the other locations, I think that this one is resting a lot on its other locations for good reviews etc."}
{"text":"My husband and I passed this place many many many times and never gave it a chance. We did come by once to eat as a spur of the moment thing (plus, unfortunately,  there's NOT that many restaurant options in Mt. Edge area) we sat down in the diner part (because we have a 2 year old) and were served by a very nice waitress. Food was actually very decent and tasty for a bar (I say that because after being to a few of them, food usually tastes greasy and they usually have same old items on the menus). Menu here is pretty extensive.  Now we keep on coming back with family and by ourselves from time to time. We enjoy sitting in \"our\" corner booth, have some good food and a couple of beers.  PS. One time we came at around 9:15 pm not realizing that the diner part closes at 9pm. Server did not allow us to sit down (they don't want them to stay overtime or for other reasons). But bartender was nice enough to let us stay and served us. She didn't mind running back and forth from her bar to our table and we really appreciated it!!!  They proved us once again that this is an amazing place."}
{"text":"Great wings, good service. Gaming/restaurant/bar. Jens a great bartender, and Rachel gave some great service."}
{"text":"T-Bird charged me a $2.00 take-out fee, which came out to $1.00 per ordered. The take-out menu never stated that there was an up-charge for ordering out."}
{"text":"I love t birds and Araceli is an awesome server. It was busy today being that it's Sunday afternoon.. Service was a little slower but that's because our server had like 1,500 tables.. Still she handled us with care and attentiveness .. I had the eggs Benny and the eggs were poached very nicely!"}
{"text":"Man .. I love me some t birds.. The relaxed environment and cheap grub makes it a regular spot for me.. I usually go to the one on blue mountain .. Which I love.. Here, not so much.. Our server forgot what we ordered.. Waited ten minutes to even tell us she forgot, then just laughed about the whole thing as if I had just nailed a stand up routine.. So off to a bad start .. Twenty minutes roll by and we're still waiting.. I ordered a salad with tuna on it.. Pretty easy stuff.. Had coffee.. She didn't bring that sweet pot of hot coffee back around my table once! I'm a little critical of service industry folks due to my background in said industry, but this lady just dropped the ball.. But hey people have bad days, I just caught her on one."}
{"text":"TBird is a great local spot to grab a quick & tasty breakfast/meal/drink served with a smile. It's good, not great...sometimes the potatoes are overcooked, the bun of the meatballs sliders get mushy, the waitress does not include the green olives in your Bloody Mary then overcharges you at $4.25 after telling me it's $3.50...THEN explains they charge .75 for bloody Mary mix. HUH?!? It's mostly good, give them a shot."}
{"text":"Breakfast, lunch, dinner. They have it all and they are fantastic. I always get their steak and eggs - an easy dish to ruin - but I have never gotten a bad one here, and I always get my steak medium raree. And they have the best chicken wings in Las Vegas. Beware, though, their medium could still be hot for most people."}
{"text":"I love this place ! The food is good and it's right by my house ! The grave bartender name Charles is awesome too !"}
{"text":"TACO BASKET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  $5  I think I have eaten about 50 of these baskets..... 3 hard tacos, fresh fried shells, ground beef, lett, toms, cheese add salsa.  Really basic but somehow tastes Awesome!  Even better when dranking.... maybe they add MSG?  staff is always good n friendly, chicken fried steak is good too... machines do pay out, sometimes....  C"}
{"text":"Hefty portions, great value, homey comfortable service: not overly efficient, but not slow either. Stick to T-Bird specialties and typical fare. Being adventurous doesn't pay here. Ask the waiter what's cooking to find the best options. Pros: Cheap, hefty, homemade feel. Cons: distinct bar atmosphere, poor atypical fare."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, and quality bartenders. We were well attended to and the food was good. I've had better wings at other bars in this area but so far this was definitely my favorite experience."}
{"text":"The best thing about this T-Birds is it's so close to my house. I often find myself here when we don't want to make decisions about dinner.   They have a separate restaurant and bar area there for those that don't appreciate inhaling cigarette smoke during their meal.   My go-to items: Chicken fried steak, taco basket and the grilled chicken caesar salad. The menu is a mile long so there is plenty of bar food to choose from. They have great breakfast items and killer Bloody Marias. Plenty of beer on tap and the service is always pretty good.   It's a solid bar with solid food."}
{"text":"My boss wanted to go to T-Bird Lounge one day for lunch because he was tired of the same old lounges we tend to frequent. T-Bird is exactly what I expected when I walked in... dim lighting, only a handful of patrons, and the only employee we saw was the bartender... So we sat at the bar.    I had the sliders, which were very yummy. Some of the better bar sliders I have had recently. My boss ordered a beer, so I tried to order jager with Red Bull, but they don't carry Red Bull at T-Bird. I didn't catch the name of the energy drink the bartender substituted, but it was actually quite good.   We played a little video poker and blackjack.. And for once I came out ahead!! Only $4 but I play conservative bets and usually don't win anything, so I left happy. Overall, it's a decent spot to check out if you are in the area...  In a city with an excessive amount of bars and lounges, it didn't really stand out to me, so I wouldn't make a special trip to try it..."}
{"text":"T-birds needs to working on seasoning their food.  I used to go there about every week on Saturday for the T-Bone special but every week the rest of my family would complain about how dull the food tasted.  The steak was also bland, I would put salt and pepper on it when it came just to give it a little flavor, which is something I wouldn't normally do.  It wouldn't take much effort or money to add some spices to the food and make it a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant, never disappointed with any meal. We can take the kids, bar is separated from the restaurant and no smoky smell.  Our favorite server is Mo, he has fun with the kids and takes care of us.  The wings in sweet Asian sauce is my favorite!"}
{"text":"T-birds has good food, especially wings and Stromboli but if you want to sit at the bar, you have to tolerate smoke. When you walk in it smells like the old  diner from years ago. The smell is horrible, that's my only complaint. If you're there for 15 minutes you'll stink. The restaurant is separate but you can still smell it.  You need a deep clean."}
{"text":"Decent food and great service.   This place was close to home, so we checked it out early Saturday for breakfast. We were told to sit where we liked. Wendy immediately greeted us with a smile. As we waited for breakfast, we noticed that there was a t.v. on in every corner. Nice.   Creamer for our coffees was already at the table, and there were flavored ones as well. I ordered eggs benedict with regular bacon, and my husband got the biscuits and gravy. We always split our breakfast, so the biscuits were more of a 'side dish' for us. The food came out quickly, and looked decent. I got a generous portion of potatoes with my benedict, and there were two biscuits split in half smothered with gravy for his.   The potatoes were by far the best part of the breakfast. They tasted great. Nicely browned and flavorful. The benedict was not too bad. The hollandaise was very lemony in flavor, but otherwise pretty mild. The biscuits and gravy were also very mild in flavor. The pepper shaker on the table was really lame. It only allowed a small amount of powdery pepper to flow. Nothing major, but I really don't like those types of pepper shakers.   Wendy really made the breakfast enjoyable. She was genuinely happy and cheerful throughout our visit. The food was decent, and we would be willing to try out more items from the menu. As we were leaving, it was starting to get fairly busy in here.   Oh, and you pay your bill with your server."}
{"text":"my boyfriend and I go here every Sunday for breakfast and sit at the same booth and we get the same waitress, Debbie. She makes sure everyone is taken care of and remembers us when we come in. My brothers favorite dish is the Philly ..its awesome!  But anything you try, you wont be disappointed, and ask for Debbie :)"}
{"text":"I've haven't done a review for T-birds yet?  That's crazy!  I wind up at this place at least once a week it seems.  Breakfast is okay.  Most of the breakfast food tastes a little bland.  They have chicken fried steak, ham, eggs, omelettes and other stuff.  Nothing ever impressed me much.  There are quite a few good things for dinner though.  The stromboli is humongous.  I have been dared to eat the large one before, and have failed.  I think I can do it if I give it another chance though.  I just need to not eat for 3 days beforehand.  I finished off a large stromboli with a friend and the bartender was impressed as even with two people it's a lot of food.  In addition to being enormous, it's also quite tasty.  The nachos are pretty good.  Large servings on that as well.  The wings are great.  I prefer the teriyaki and the hot wings.  Pro tip: get the hot wings seared.  Rueben sandwich is good.  Clam chowder in a sourdough bowl is a disappointment.  The bread tastes rubbery and is a bit on the small side."}
{"text":"The T-Bird is a classic. Think a diner that you can drink beer at the bar. Very, very cheap breakfasts that always fill me up during Saturday morning errand running.   Service is always super friendly and they have all the standards on tap- cold domestic  and one of two IPAs. Totally recommend it for a low-key stop."}
{"text":"Have seen this place a few times and decided to find ally try it out. Was surprised to see the daily special menu and had to try the T-bone steak (Saturday special). The steak was cooked correctly and was nice and tender, it did lack some spices, but some A1 made up for that. The Cole slaw and fries were great too, overall a great deal ($12) and good food."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Nice staff but their food is just okay. As a gaming bar you would think they would comp more than one drink when you've lost 100+ dollars. I ordered a Caesar salad with steak and it was extremely chewy."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying I've never had a bad meal here.  Now for my story, my husband and I had dinner here last night and before we ate I went in the bathroom to wash my hands, came out ate dinner and came home, while getting ready for bed I realized my wedding ring was missing, it has been loose for awhile because of weight loss, so in my panic I called and talked to Tammy, she called me back 10 minutes later and said they tore the booth apart and couldn't find it, meanwhile I was on my way back so I mentioned I had washed my hands and wanted to know if I could check the garbage, she said sure, I got there and she said she had looked but found nothing, but let me look again, she dumped the can over (btw it was only hand towels for drying your hand after washing) we heard a loud THUNK, I scrambled through the towels and there it was. She gave me a long hug and told me how happy she was. I want to thank you Tammy for your help, you are what good service is all about."}
{"text":"I only go here late night so I can't judge the day crew. It's a chill spot, bar gaming is decent. Bartenders are usually awesome, great customer service, always friendly and welcoming seem to like their job make great drinks and know how to hold a interesting conversation. :) the 2 stars is because the food and not much of a crowd. Pizza is decent, the tacos are ok, the sandwich is alright but I'm better off cooking... the bartenders always tried helping but it just doesn't taste great... last I ordered was like a chicken sandwich concoction with fries and it was horrible I never return food and I'm not the kind of person to waste food, the fries tasted freezer burned or not cooked properly, the chicken tenders had good buffalo sauce but were too hard, the bread for the sandwich was too hard to eat the bartender seen my face and comped it even tho I was willing to pay... It was nice he was observant. The bar is great but not so much the food during late night hours."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE T-Birds!   Highly recommend to all!  Amazing Food!!! Amazing Service!   Wish we won more at poker and keno....but we have such a good time here.     We have tried several items on the menu and have NEVER been disappointed.   Breakfast, lunch and dinner.  We have never sat in the dining room area but it always seems busy.    Great and very attentive Bartenders!  Jenna is our fave!  If you love a good Bloody Mary?  Try one here!  Very good!"}
{"text":"This is my spot. The food is amazing. The bartenders are awesome.  I love coming here for the chill environment and good music.  Awesome spot. Be sure to check it out!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, food is all good the ultimate grilled cheese is probably the best grilled cheese ever!"}
{"text":"Just OK- came here and sat in the bar for a Saturday breakfast. The bloody mary was horrible, but the breakfast was decent. I ordered egg white omelet with swiss cheese. The cheese was that processed sliced junk but the hashbrowns and the eggs were good. I would come back, the bar was not at all smoky which was great. I'm not much of a gambler - but the bartender talked me into signing up for a players card because they gave new cards a $20 match play-- so I won $22on video blackjack and my BF and I got breakfast for free... woot."}
{"text":"I've been going to T-birds for years.  Their nachos are phenomenal, the teriyaki wings....mouth watering, and the portions are huge.  The staff is always great.  Their locations are convenient.  I've never had an issue here.  I've also never had anything I didn't like.  I can't wait to try the funky reuben."}
{"text":"I go to the location in Henderson on Eastern near the 215, but I hear this location is also good. I love this place because it's the closest thing to having a 24 hour diner in the Las Vegas Metro area. The food is great and so is the service. Wether you're going for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. It's all good and there are even special things you can order off the menu, like fried ice cream! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was ok. The reason for a 3 Star was I found a clear plastic wrap in my cole slaw!! Server replaced it with fresh cole slaw and apologized but I didn't eat any of it."}
{"text":"This place has good cheap eats. But the service and clientele have gone way down. This is a played out garbage place."}
{"text":"Came here late at night with two other people. We sat at the bar and ordered food and gambled. The person that took care of us for the food was outstanding!!!! He was very attentive and friendly. The bartender was decent but took awhile to come to our side of the bar. He seemed more focused on talking with his buddies on the other side. Overall it was a decent experience for the bar and outstanding service from austin. Austins service skills are far better than most restaurants i have been to. I hope the owner reads this and gives him the credit he deserves."}
{"text":"We found a new chill spot for our late night friend meet-ups! The kitchen takes great care in the food they make, more than I would expect for the low prices. The service is bomb, too! Andrew made sure we were satisfied and taken care of. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Decided to drop by to get something to eat since an oil change at Ted Wiens Auto store was going to take a couple of hours. The customer service is really nice and the place has a diner feel to it. I got some coffee and eggs, toast, and oatmeal. It wasn't great, but it was good none the less. The server was attentive and checked on how I was doing so that was nice. The place was clean and I would come back to try some other stuff on the menu, but it was the good customer service that stood out to me."}
{"text":"The wings here are my favorite. Always cooked to perfection and never overdone like they can get at other wing places. The burgers are really good too. Plus, Erica & Lisa are the best! They treat us like we're family. This is our go to spot to watch games since it doesn't get overly crowded with annoying drunks!"}
{"text":"They got degraded for poor practices in the kitchen. How nasty, should have known every time I got sick after eating a Stromboli"}
{"text":"Consistent $6 breakfast.  2 eggs, breakfast meat, country fries, and toast.  These were served quickly and effeciently by an older waitress \"Mary\".  Dining room was clean.  The beverage girl kept my drink full.  Did not like the consistency of the ham.  I will be back."}
{"text":"We eat here often. Our favorite server retired on us but we were able to replace her quickly with Debbie! Often before sitting Debbie will be on her way to our table with our waters. She even knows our usual meals! Right price + great food + wonderful service = EXCELLENT RESTAURANT"}
{"text":"Large tvs to watch the games, food is bomb but it is bar food so dont be going for first class dinner, the calzones ARE THE BEST."}
{"text":"Great food good service. The bar has good air filtration so it is not all smokey."}
{"text":"I have never been so disappointed when dining out. The service was good, but the food was horrible! Everything was bland, bread was stale and tomatoes and lettuce were so old... yuck! I don't know if this place has just gone downhill or if it's always been this bad, but I have no desire to go back. There's so many great dining options in Vegas and T-Bird Lounge definitely needs to step up their game!"}
{"text":"its super bowl Sunday 2013, my old high school buddy and I are far from our home town, and need a place to have a few beers, ea, t and watch the game.  We walk to the nearby T-birds, and have the option of the non-smoking dining area.  we jump at it since it's vacant.  We get our own, adorable waitress, and we order this amazing spread that feeds us both for days.  the food was spectacular, the service outta sight great, and the calzone is the size of a boogie board..and is a meat lovers dream come true.  I wish I had a T-birds withing walking distance, though with all the great food, I may need crawling distance instead :-P"}
{"text":"We came here for the bar food.  Good food.  Service was ok, sometimes we had to walk up to the bar to get small things like to go boxes, extra water etc.    Not too bad considering there was only a bartender and no waitresses.  The only thing missing was a lack of graveyard specials, other than that the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"The food here has been ok to good.  I've gotten cheeseburgers, chicken fingers and fries and none of it was bad.  The bartender, Charles, is super nice and funny.  It's a good little spot to go to because it's close to my friend's house, but it's very much a typical Vegas bar."}
{"text":"Came in with 15 people. I had the Reuben sandwich. Monster amounts of fresh, thinly sliced corned beef. The bread was fresh and great! Had to be one of the best Reuben sandwiches I've ever had. Every one else seemed to enjoy their food as well......... my friends hamburger looked REALLY good. I will be back again!"}
{"text":"Stromboli...challenge.   Half the size of the table.  Everything but the kitchen sink is inside this delight.....wait a minute. ..yes, here is a faucet. .. you are going to force it down to get it done....more than enough for 3 big men or 7 boy scouts"}
{"text":"The Worst Reuben I've had anywhere.   Corned beef was like hard strips of rubber, no sauerkraut, and a small sandwich to assault to injury.   Great service though and low prices"}
{"text":"I ordered the fish and chips and I must say it was sub par.  I'm all about trying new things, but this particular item was not worth it.  Never coming back."}
{"text":"Just left and they no longer offer food to go. Skip this place large selection in the area."}
{"text":"So we tried the wings for the first time here and I have to say, they were pretty good. We had ordered them for pick up and they were quite quick and the waitress was very nice as well. I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"My husband and our neighbor goes here all the time.  So we went, the waitress was friendly, she talked about there football specials ect.  I got the breakfast sandwich with bacon.  It was good, taste just like mine at home.  I might go back from time to time, it's not on the top of my list tho."}
{"text":"Just another local bar like PT's, with a pool table and a jukebox.  My first time here just to chill with friends at 3am with nothing else to do.  We all ordered wings and fries which was ok.  Everyone here seems to be a regular.  3 stars because first impression wasn't that great because of a drunk patron yelling out obscenities to the bartender calling him out, trying to fight him.  It lasted for a while with other guest jumping in to escort the guy out.  Where is a bouncer when you need one?  Maybe I'll give it another rating again if for some reason I end up coming here next time around."}
{"text":"Trying new spots in the new neighborhood. After a bad experience at a competitor, came to this T Bird. I had been to others in town so I knew it would be a cool experience. We were greeted with smiles, football specials and great service! We'll be regulars here, for sure!"}
{"text":"I come here only for their hot chicken fingers which I think are the best in town. I've been to other places but nothing beats this place for the chicken fingers, I haven't tried anything else on the menu so I can't comment on that!  The blonde waitress is always very nice to me and I'm glad that she so polite."}
{"text":"After swimming all day we stopped here to eat as we were really hungry. Worst idea yet. $11 chicken fingers looked like a school lunch and my wife steak sandwich was the worst ever. The bartender never even acknowledged us ? Well just a warning for the next couple who walks in.... Turn around and go ....."}
{"text":"We've been here a handful of times.  They have great food (large menu for a bar), great service, a lot of large tv's and a good beer selection.  Food always come out quick and good.  I've also been to the older location on Eastern.   Always good food and service there too."}
{"text":"What a great place to come hang with friends. The food is great, especially the wings make sure you get them charbroiled the best in town by far. What great bartenders their are great and friendly (Tina, Ryan). If you come with kids they have rooms for that to. Great TV to watch the games. Pool table and shuffleboard to play."}
{"text":"T-Bird Lounge and Restaurant is a really nice neighborhood bar.  Their prices are reasonable and their food is delicious.  During our visit their, we ordered the hamburger and chicken wings.  The hamburger is enough for two people to share.  Overall, this place is Fun, with a friendly staff. This place also contains, great prices, with lots of tv's located in convenient spots so it is great for sporting events."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I like to go chill with our guys after work to T-Bird. We usually go here about once or twice a week and I realized I failed to write a review about this place! We usually go into around 11pm. Its usually Mike or Melissa that is working. They rock, so down to earth! Its funny, for as many times were go here, we always end up ordering the same stuff: 1. The Feast- 36 wings (half plain & half teriyaki CHARRED); Stromboli; Caesar Salad (YUM... you know if the caesar salad is LEGIT if its extra stinky!!!); basket of fries.  2. Western Burger- served with either cole slaw, potato salad, potato salad. DUDE the burger is a monster! It has thick bacon and onion rings. Its the type of burger you see on a Carls Jr. ad where the bbq sauce falls on your shirt and gets on your face.   Ending your day exhausted, its one of the best places to grab and ice cold beer and grub on some food!!!"}
{"text":"When I work till 5am, I drop by for an IPA and the steak & eggs special.  $14 with tax and tip, and I'm usually the only one there."}
{"text":"This review is for the BAR section only.  I live literally about 3 minutes away driving from T Bird and needless to say have passed by many times over the past couple of years. I was looking forward to checking this place out based on the reviews and location. Unfortunately, I was extremely let down. Upon walking in I had a bad vibe. The whole place smelled of cigarettes and the place looked run down.  The bartender (I didn't catch his name) gave off a horrible first impression. No greeting or smile and the bar was empty except for one other person (it was around midnight). This should've been my sign to run but I decided to stick it out and give them a chance. He took our drink orders and handed us a menu. There's no HH here, which is fine with me. I don't mind paying full price. We ended up ordering wings, which were actually really good but I think my overall experience just made me want to leave. All in all, we spent about 30 minutes here and couldn't wait to go. We hardly saw the bartender because he was too busy chit chatting with someone on the opposite side of the bar and took forever getting our check (or what felt like forever). I will never return here ever again. 2 stars for wings; 0 stars for the service."}
{"text":"This place is a typical sports bar/diner mashup. The food here is decent, the wait staff are friendly, and the atmosphere isn't too crazy loud most of the time. The main thing that sets this place so low is how mundane it is. The food is decent, but not great. The wait staff are friendly, but not exceptional. Its just a blah place. If you don't particularly have a favorite diner type place, the T-bird lounge is sufficient, but if you have a place you really enjoy, you would do better to visit your own haunt."}
{"text":"**Summary**        - Flavor - I like the cottage potatoes over regular boring hash browns. Steak and eggs quality wise, it's one of the best for under $8.        - Value - They have some pretty good food for such a cheap price. The best value is from 10pm to noon the next day where they have the breakfast specials and the $6.50 steak and eggs. The deals during the regular hours aren't bad either. **Price**        - $6.50 7 oz. steak and eggs **Recommendations**        - I'd recommend this place for a cheap, yet quality late night or morning meal."}
{"text":"A quick bite to eat and a beer at 2am? Not a problem. T-Birds has all the greasy bar fare and a few salads for those who might not want a late night snack that will leave you tossing and turning.   After a rough week of training, being surrounded by beers I could see and not have, I needed a drink. I have not been to T-Birds since my broke college days, but I remember the fond memories about their wings. Their NY salad is on the tough side, but for $7 no one is expecting prime cut. The nachos are massive and could easily feed two. The beer selection on draft is not large, but varied enough to satisfy.   The wait staff is warm and checks up often."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood gaming bar. Even though the outside looks a bit retro the inside is modern and clean.  Not sure if they always have this special but PBR on draft for $1! Our bartender on this Friday night was very friendly and attentive. We didn't get any food but our friend raved about their pizza."}
{"text":"One of the best place to eat breakfast.  Especially on Sunday morning during the NFL football season.  The prices there are even nicer.   I had a Tall Bloody Mary and is was so good I had a second and a third and the last one was as good as the first one !  I had the corn beef-hash and eggs and it was a good portion and tasted great!"}
{"text":"Fun place! Really friendly staff. Great prices and excellent food. Lots of tv's located in convenient spots so it is great for sporting events. I love that they have a juke box as well."}
{"text":"Really tasty Burgers that give you the option of having a side salad without the extra cost. Burgers made to order, very tasty and not skimpy at all. A nice alternative to the typical fast food joint."}
{"text":"If you like stromboli's this plas is awesome. Huge portions. Good service and cheap drafts.  We order a large and take home enough to make 2 more meals. Great deal"}
{"text":"I came in for a quesadilla I love this place and the service but what bar doesn't have a quesadilla. I thought I was at T-Birds but apparently I\"m on Mars cuz they ain't got no quesadilla!!!!"}
{"text":"Probably the cheapest video poker tavern bar food in the Blue Diamond/Enterprise area. It's a good value but you get what you pay for, as most of the food is unremarkable, if well portioned.  The chicken fingers are so-so, but the assortment of sauces offered with them helps. I went with the hot buffalo. I also added on a pile of dry, overcooked, frozen crinkle cut fries for $1, which I regretted.  The potato skins, housemade quarter-potato chunks, get loaded with large pieces of bacon and cheese, with only the slightest bit of sour cream to lubricate your throat. The stromboli is huge, cheesy and possibly the saltiest thing I've ever eaten.  As far as video poker taverns go, this one is kind of blah on the inside. One pool table, sort of barren beige decor. The staff always seems friendly enough but this just seems like a depressing place for a meal or a drink. Do yourself a favor and pay the 50 cents per item surcharge to get yours to go."}
{"text":"Blah, I should have ordered the wings \"charred\", but I will most likely never go back to this place, very common food, not worth the price. And the reviews were right the waitress disappears to God knows where."}
{"text":"A neighborhood type lounge with reasonable drinks and decent food.  The staff is friendly and remembers your face and what you like to drink.  However, this is a watering hole not an ultra lounge or club."}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop for a quick, inexpensive meal with no frills.  My husband and I have been here a few times because it's centrally located on Eastern and we know that we can get a great selection of reasonably priced food and good service.   I've had the chicken fried steak, as well as their version of a surf and turf (steak and shrimp). Both were delicious - I was impressed with the portion size of the the CFS and the gravy was really good.   Most recently I had the steak and shrimp and would definitely order it again. You get a lot of food - although the steak is not the best cut, you can't really complain for $14. The shrimp were actually really flavorful, and the meal also came with a choice of potato, cole slaw and a side of Texas toast.  Each time I have been in the restaurant, it's not crowded at all. The service is friendly and we really don't have any complaints! Plus, they currently offer 7% cash back, so it's great to get a little something back after dining there!"}
{"text":"This place was an unexpected surprise.  My husband has been coming here to eat for a long time.  He told me it was good, but I wasn't sure how good.  I was thinking, it's bar food, can't be that different.  I've tasted the onion rings here, mozzarella sticks, caesar chicken salad and a burger.  All have been great.  I think they just do simple things, like changing out the oil they use regularly, but whatever they're doing is really making a difference.  Great comfort food when you get the chance to splurge on the calories :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! My family and I used to live really close and now that we don't we still visit often. Food is good, and the servers are so friendly and make us feel so welcome. Erica is amazing! She makes us and everyone feel so welcome and we make sure she is there before we come in. She talks to everyone and has the best customer service!"}
{"text":"My husband and I will occasionally come here for breakfast. The food and service has been great every time. One of these days we will need to come here for dinner and try their pizza."}
{"text":"Had Lunch there yesterday 7/15/17..........Horrible service.  We ordered drinks and then burgers.  Served forgot Ketchup.  We finished our meal and asked for a to go box.  She cleared dishes only.  We used the to go box to clean our table of dirty napkins and clean our ashtray.  We sat for about 20 minutes without a drink. I went to the bar with money in hand and asked the bartender for 2 drinks.  She told me to sit back down and she would send someone.  There was only 1 Person seated at the bar so I thought this was rather strange.  We waited another ten minutes for someone to get us a drink. Terrible Terrible Customer Service"}
{"text":"This is like having family dinner at home when no one feels like cooking.  We go here at least once every week, be it for dinner on a hectic week night or for breakfast on the weekend.  In all the years we've been going to T-Bird, we have always had warm, friendly service.  The food is like home cooking,  Highlights are the pot roast on Mondays and the breakfast served 24 hours.  They also have TVs for the sports fans and you can choose where you want to sit - just plunk down and you'll have someone there to help you within a minute.  With teenagers, it's important to have a varied menu, and they have that covered.  One secret for the working mom is to order a stromboli.  Even the smalls are good for two lunches at work from leftovers,  Picture second base on a plate!"}

{"text":"Holy crap! This place surprised the hell out of me! I drive by this place everyday on the way home. It's right off Blue Diamond and Lindell in the same shopping center as the Star Nursery. There is nothing in this shopping center other than these two things. I don't know why but from the outside and the name of the place, I was hardly expecting much.   What I found inside was quite a surprise. This wasn't a crappy run down bar. This was a bar that rivals most neighborhood bars I've been to. They've got the entertainment (pool table and shuffleboard) in their own little sections with separate seating for good size parties. The place is spacious inside with plenty of seating. There's also a cool-lookin jukebox with a nice selection.   For Christmas, they've decorated the place up quite nice. During my visit, the staff was really friendly and always had smiles on their faces. The service was prompt and I had no complaints whatsoever. They had hefeweizen on draft which made me super happy also.  But THE most impressive part of the place even after everything I've mentioned thus far? The food. Holy s!$t... The lady told me before I ordered the wings that they beat out Buffalo Wild Wings and Hooters... I thought, \"Yea right, but whatever. I'm hungry.\" Dude. They're not messin around. The wings were OUTSTANDING! And they indeed hit my top place to eat wings of all time, and I am a bar food veteran (I don't know if I'm proud of that, though).   My wife ate a California chicken club that had fresh bacon and guac which was amazing too. I could totally see this being my new favorite spot for a drink and some dinner in a pinch. There's nothing better than my wife's Nepali dishes she cooks, but this place came pretty damn close. Even she loved the place, and she isn't impressed too easily.  Needless to say, we'll be back. I had no complaints whatsoever. They had it all. I think more people should know about the magic that happens at this place. I'm surprised I was born and raised in Las Vegas, I've been to hundreds of bars, and I've never walked in to one of these bars.   Man, they've really got it goin on at this place. I can't say enough great things about it. Just trust me, though. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good neighborhood staple.  Lots of variation on the menu will make anybody happy at this restaurant. I've been to several of their locations, this one has the typical prompt service and decent food.  The BLT salad was really good, with the option to add chicken or steak for no extra charge.  The taco salad is really good too, and the french dip is not bad.  I know several people who love their wings, I personally don't like to eat meat with bones in it so I haven't tried them.  Will definitely be back for a quick and easy meal.  Good with large parties as well."}
{"text":"I love this little place the one on Eastern is terrible but this one is fantastic Erica the waitress is the best. She's tells us off all the time and we love it and her!  I go there all the time and hang out with my friends in the restaurant because it's not super busy and They don't rush you out. They make you feel like you're their friend and the food is on point much better than any PTs that's for sure! Definitely a must check out!"}
{"text":"I'm not a \"bar food\" kinda person, but this place is close to my house so I decided to give it a try. So far we've had the sliders which are awesome, the pizza (thin crust) surprisingly awesome, and breakfast for around $5 which was way better that most casino breakfasts for a fraction of the price. Also the bartenders are super friendly every time we've been in. It's close, it's quick, it's cheap, now I just wish they'd deliver!"}
{"text":"A great local bar location with cheap food and nice servers. We arrived around 10 and they were empty in the dining area. The server was so friendly and greeted each patron like she new them, most of the rig upsets she most likely did.   My mom and I ordered some breakfast and prices were beyond reasonable. My omelet was made to order and was good.   Service with a smile and great prices while watching the games, we'll likely be back soon to partake in more of the bar area as well."}
{"text":"Two words, chicken wings...because here you will find the best in Vegas!! Of course that's just my opinion, but why not try it out for yourself?!   They are juicy, tasty and not your average shrunken wing that you need to eat 15 of to get full...in other words, they're very good sized wings. We are here at least once a month and not to mention whenever we crave the wings, we order them for pick up. Especially because our kids love them as well.   Yes, we've tried other things - the onion rings, burgers, meat loaf and fries ...which were all very good as well.The wings are what we'll continue to come back for though and the friendly service as well."}
