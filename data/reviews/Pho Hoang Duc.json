{"text":"Best Pho I ever had. Don't miss this one!!  Prices are right...service was ok.

Just a hole in wall ambience but the food more than made up for it"}
{"text":"First visit and was pleasantly surprised.  Only 3 tables to serve and single server/owner was friendly and fast to bring out the well done beef pho.  I couldn't believe the taste of the broth; simply filling - an orgasm for the taste buds.  I will be a regular at this place from this point forward.  ; )  Keep up the wonderful service and food."}
{"text":"This restaurant opened the beginning of April after the owners of Dong-A closed shop.  Previous customers of Dong A should take note that, along with the premises, the new restaurant also managed to keep the same phone number as the last owners.  

I don't know how much restaurant experience the owners of this new place have, but they need some serious work.  First, I had called before coming to verify the hours of operation.  At no time did they mention the name of the restaurant when I called; had they done so, I wouldn't have driven the 30 mins. from Goodyear to come.

When we arrived, it was obvious that a lot of work was put into the renovation:  the place was cleaned up, painted and repairs made; a very big step, as the previous owners left half the restaurant unlit, cluttered, air conditioner barely operating and the place overall dingy.  But the fresh coat of paint and cleaned up floors and bathroom were the highlight of the visit.

Like Dong A, this appears to be a 2 man operation (or seems that way).  Only one person was working the floor (and unlike Dong A -- whether due to aggressive advertising or curiosity about the new place -- there were more customers here on a Sunday night than Dong A used to see in a month).  We were met by the manager/waiter as we walked through the door and were quickly seated.  There were no utensils or napkins (though, to be fair, there were chopsticks in a plastic holder on the table like most Vietnamese restaurants).  We were brought no menus; we were brought no water.  After 15 minutes, the waiter came to ask what we wanted; we asked for menus and were brought paper take-out menus.  After several minutes, he returned to take our order.  My partner quickly determined what he wanted, but I could not decide among the very few, non-pho dishes on the one sheet of paper.  So he took my partner's order and walked off, giving me more time.  Now, I should add here, that I am not slow in either ordering or eating; so when I say he returned after several minutes, I mean that literally; there was barely time to look through the menu.  In the interim, several tables came in and he went to take their orders.  Which meant I had to wait 15 minutes before I was able to summon him back (I called him; he didn't return).  In general, I see nothing wrong with that; but because we sat for so long without menus and then were given such a short time to look through them, this delay meant an even longer wait to get my food, because he had to help everyone else who came in after us, but immediately got menus.

Then my partner's meal came.  He had the lemon grass chicken (after having to correct the waiter twice), which looked like Alpo with a ton of rice (he said it was good; I tried a piece and could not verify the breed of feline filling in for the chicken).  My meal was still cooking and I had to ask THREE times to get my drink.

My dinner (Bun dac biet houng duc) arrived just as my partner finished dinner.  Mine was good, but mostly rice noodles with a very small egg roll and bare amounts of meat thrown in.  We then ordered my other half a banh mi thit nuong sandwich, as the main dish was not very substantial.  The sandwich arrived on an oversized hot dog bun (a la Walmart) and had meat completely alien to other versions of this sandwich we've had in many restaurants.

I will say that the owner/waiter was very polite and solicitous -- asking several times how everything was and, as was obvious by his quick \"thank you\"s and nods before I even finished my comments, not having a clue what my answers meant -- but the overall experience was akin to South Vietnamese style fast food combined with North Vietnamese apathetically slow service.  I can only hope this was either an off-night or opening-month blunders which will be fixed over time, because I otherwise see a bigger disaster for this place than the fall of Saigon was 40+ years ago."}
{"text":"I was visiting Phoenix recently, and my sister took me to this place.
What a fantastic little restaurant.
It has been recently remodeled. It has bright colorful decor., and a  new ventilation system. They are even working on an outdoor patio behind the store with a small koi pond.
The owner treated us like family. 
He proudly recommends some of his very unusual dishes. 
I had the Crisp Lemon Grass Chicken with steamed rice because I like spicy food.
My sister had one of the dishes the owner recommended. 
Our food was delicious! I also loved the ice water with strawberries in it.
The owner also served us spring rolls which were the best I have ever had.
The owner was concerned that I might not get full, as I'm a large guy, and offered to bring me some beef pho to try if I was still hungry. I thought that was incredibly considerate. The plate I ordered was plenty to sate, but I did finish my sisters pho as she had to much. (But that's the kind of guy I am)
This was only my 2nd time for Vietnamese food, but my sister frequents often. 
You will find the food and service at this restaurant exceptional."}
{"text":"Had the Chicken pho and it was great! Got there an hour before close, so the place was empty. The owner was nice, but the other person in there was not so pleasant. 

For 2 bowls of pho, plain noodles, fried rice and 2 sodas, the bill was $32. Since this is the 3rd pho experience, not really sure if it was a great deal or not.

Not to sure this would be my regular stop, but I would consider it especially since they are open until 9pm. All of the other places were closed, so that is how I happened to find this place. Also, be sure to check your credit card receipt, we got charged $20 over. Thank goodness we caught it and were able to get it corrected!"}
{"text":"I'll have to agree with Huy N. - the pho broth is delicious! Also, this restaurant serves the best banh xeo I've ever had. While the menu list may not be as extensive as those in the venerable establishments like Pho Thanh, there are definitely enough offerings to satisfy any aficionado of Vietnamese cuisine. The restaurant is spacious, the service is friendly and parking is not a problem even if this is located in a small strip mall, in the space formerly occupied by Dong-A."}
{"text":"While the service was decent and the food tasted good, no one likes finding a cockroach in their pho. Very disappointing and downright nasty."}
{"text":"The owner was so friendly and the pho was super yummy ! He has a cute little garden with a small fishy pond out in the back you can decide to eat out there but I believe you should call ahead"}
{"text":"Pho Hoang Duc is not a fancy Vietnamese Restaurant. This is a smaller family owned and operated restaurant. Currently they post a grade \"A\" Maricopa Health Inspection on the door. My review is only based on one visit but I did get the impression that the food they serve is very much above the average I tried that's Vietnamese Cuisine. 

We started with Spring Rolls that were fresh and light. They contained shattering crisp tofu that I never had before and were served with a tasty peanut based sauce.

For my meal I had the Hanoi Turmeric Fish with Dill. The mild meaty fish was flavored with exotic flavors and was fried and caramelized. It was delicious with all the sides of lettuce, minty herbs, fish sauce, noodles and peanuts. All together it was wildly flavorful and full of interesting textures. The owner was kind enough to take the time to show me how to eat it the Vietnamese way by tearing the lettuce, adding noodles, dunking the fish in sauce and topping with peanuts. This dish is the National Dish of Hanoi. I've had it before but never served with all the sides before. This version seemed more like how it is suppose to be. I thought it was delicious I think anyone would like it. I often wonder what many other Vietnamese Restaurants don't serve this National Dish?

My husband had the Spicy Beef and Pork Noodle Soup. My husband squealed \"Spaghetti\"but I think it was Soba......This Noodle soup differed slightly from other Spicy Beef and Pork Noodle Soups by having slightly different meats floating in it and the side dish of sprouts and herbs were interesting and mostly minty. The side dish also contained fresh cabbage and lemon instead of lime.

Prices at the time of this review are subject to change but I don't think anything on the menu was over $7.95 and the Banh Mi Sandwiches were priced at-

 *****ONLY $2.95***********

So I had to take one home for latter.

I took home a Chicken Baguette.
The bread has this really delicious bread aroma. It's more crusty than crisp but has a soft center. My sandwich was very generous with mayonnaise but also contained other sauces of hot chili and sweet barbecue. The chicken was fried and full of great flavors......but it was chewy like wing meat. Also contained the pickled carrot and radish salad with cucumber and fresh cilantro. This was a wildly flavorful Banh mi and delicious.

The family working there were very engaging, thoughtful, friendly and appreciative. 

This restaurant seems special.

Very Very Good!"}
{"text":"I came in extremely hungry. The bowl of beef Pho came quickly , was extremely feeling and delicious. I met several regulars that regularly enjoy their favorites: Pho, spring rolls, iced coffee, fried rice."}
{"text":"When we walked in the restaurant, there was no one except my friend and I. Instantly noticed that there was no ac or fan and there was only one server working. Literally just one worker, who was the server, cook and dj (he played multiple different kinds of song). I ordered beef and beef all pho and Thai tea. The pho was really good but it was kind of hard to enjoy because the restaurant was so hot. As for the Thai tea, I got it with boba and gave me the skinny straw, like how am I suppose to drink the boba? Lol. It tasted different from other Thai tea that I've tasted because it had a slight bitter after taste. It also had a thick consistency and I wasn't sure if it was suppose to be like that so I didn't bother to finish the drink. While we were eating there was 2 flies that kept bothering us. Like how does this place have a 4 star rating on yelp??? Overall, I wouldn't recommended this place."}
{"text":"We were starving after shopping at lams. Stumbled upon this little joint and got 2 banh mi and pho and left super happy. He bread was fresh and the lemon chicken was delicious. The price is right, too! Will def return next time we are in phx."}
{"text":"Vietnamese as good as it gets!  The owner is super friendly and makes you feel right at home.  Pho is superb as well as the spring rolls (very fresh - not pre made!) Owner will suggest dishes that you may not have tried before.  Love this place - my new favorite!!"}
{"text":"Quiet and peaceful. They didn't bugged me while I ate. Only pateon there while on visit"}
{"text":"What do you know about Pho? You don't know anything until you TRY it here. With 18 years of experience. I can tell you that I have never tried pho this smooth. It was the perfect texture and just felt right going down my belly. The soup was delicious so good it reminded me of Vietnam. If you go to Grand Canyon University this place is a GEM \"Pho\"sure! I would recommend this to anyone, this is the dark horse for Pho Place in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great place, fantastic service too! Ask your server for a recommendation; you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my top Pho spot. It's family owned and has been here long before the Pho trend. The other dishes are authentic, ingredients are fresh, and I have never had a bad dish. Its casual and the service is helpful and courteous."}
{"text":"I love eating here.
This place is a friendly family restaurant.
Quaint yet clean.
Food is delicious. I enjoy the spicy items."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening and the place was dead. Service was also terrible for us being the only people in there. That should've been our cue to leave, but we didn't want to come off as rude. I knew something was sketchy with this place.. as I was drinking my water, there was a roach floating in there. Super disgusting. Roach infested place. Should really have their license revoked!!"}
{"text":"This place is dirty. As I was sitting I felt something crawling on my leg. I got up fast and saw it was a cockroach. That's when I noticed they were all over the ground. There worst part is that I did not notice until after I was done eating. Disgusting !"}
{"text":"The food was great ! Taste of the pho broth was exceptional!! 

The only reason I'm rating this place so low is , as I enjoyed my food a few roaches crawled across my table ....I left immediately !"}
{"text":"I I appreciate how the gentleman was ready to serve us. The unfortunate part is that the food was old the place was really slow and the Thai tea made my husband sick the Boba in the tights he was actually extremely soggy. The fried rice tasted old and the pho was store. Ought nothing authentic. Not recommended."}
