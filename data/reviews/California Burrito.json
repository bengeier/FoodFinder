{"text":"Went there as family of 6. Friendly service, even threw in 2 plates of nachos and quesadilla in. We tried the spicy chicken, steak, shrimp and halibut. All good, though the halibut was deep fried ( it says crispy on the menu) . The lamb was out so have to make a return visit soon. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Stopped in \"California Burrito\" today to try this place out as I've been looking for a \"California Burrito\" ever since I've moved to Canada 3 years ago. I will say that this is not a true CA burrito, but it is close. I say that because the owner is using fresh Ingredients as opposed to opening cans of salsa and bags of processed cheese like is done in most TO \"mexican\" places.   The toppings are fresh and diverse and the burritos have actual flavor. This is the first week they are open so it's only going to get better. They do have some work to do, but they are way ahead of the pack of what's currently available in the GTA.   Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I went to California Burrito last night with a couple girl friends because after eating at Chipotle downtown with my boyfriend i had become obsessed. Since traveling downtown wasn't an option I heard of this place and decided to give it a try. I ordered the Sacremento chicken burrito which was good, but the chicken itself didnt have any seasoning on it like at Chipotle :( I was hoping they'd have a similar flavoring but oh well. Anyway, I wish they had they're toppings in plain view like at most shops, in order for me to see what i was choosing to put on my burrito i had to get on my tippy toes..lol they have the bar way too high, i think most ppl want to see what their options are no? My friend ordered some sort of cheesey fries dish which she was a bit dissapointed with only because her fries weren't put down until my burrito was done being made. I guess the guy forgot or something..so her fries weren't very crispy since they were down only a few minutes. So kinda soggy. Aside from that I had a nice experience..hopefully they get a chicken option with some flavor or something! They're fairly new so im sure there will be changes down the line. The nacho chips were great!(you get them with your meal)"}
{"text":"Sadly this place closed recently (Feb or Mar 2013) and a mediocre burrito place has taken over the premises.  Review below is / was for California's.  Me gusto mucho!!  Chic modern decor.  Food made to order, what more could you ask?  Since it is made fresh be patient, it's worth the wait.  Ordered nachos and roasted veggie burrito.   Warning!  If you ask for spicy you better be able to handle the heat!!  Diff between regular and large burrito is the amount of filling not the size of the flour tortilla.  Natchos were a generous mound of colorful chips topped with warm ground beef, guacomole and shredded cheese.  Killer spicy yummy!  Veg burrito was a nice blend of eggplant green and yellow peppers zucchini onions and tomatoes and  beans rice and cheese.  I hate burritos but this one is delish!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went in today for lunch at 2pm and the place was empty. We worried if we'd made the wrong choice but it was so cold outside we decided to stay in and give this place a chance. And I'm so glad we did!  The owner was really friendly. We placed an order for a chicken burrito in a tortilla wrap and a pork burrito also in a tortilla wrap along with a side of nachos. The owner got us two servings of nachos in place of one since we hadn't been to the restaurant before and he told us it was really popular. Unfortunately for us, the nachos came with a topping of beef and neither my friend nor I eat beef. The owner sent it back and brought in LA fries in place of that for no extra charge! The fries were quite good though if you leave it for too long they get a bit soggy with the toppings (My friend and I were talking more and eating less so not really the chef's fault).   We asked for our burritos to be spicy and hot and they actually were. The helping was quite generous and both of us found ourselves unable to finish the burritos- they're quite filling!   Staff was friendly, the service was quick, the food was fresh and delicious and reasonably priced too.   The restaurant is out of the way for us but all in all we were so pleased with the service and food we'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I've been to this spot three times and after each visit, I'm already planning my next trip.   I've enjoyed everything I've gotten off the menu here so far ( lamb burrito, chicken taco, steak tacos). all ingredients are super fresh and made in house. the marinades add a ton of flavour to any meat you decide on and the flavours meld together seamlessly. even the tortilla chips are seasoned!   the owner is extra friendly, beware though, as he was so chatty he over cooked the shrimp in my boyfriend's taco.   only negative is they removed size options on burritos (one size satisfies all?) so the prices have increased significantly."}
