{"text":"Small hole in the wall coffee shop in the Peter Lougheed Hospital in NE Calgary.  I stopped in for a white hot chocolate on the way to visit my gramps; drink was delicious, service was sub-par. The barista made me feel like my drink order was interupting her conversation with another staff member. Also tried one of their puffed wheat squares, and it tasted about as good as a 3 month old box of crackers. I would stop in again, only because I really enjoy the drinks, but don't expect a stellar customer service experience, and save the small talk for the nursing staff."}
{"text":"Meh... A great spot to meet up with folks before heading in. The coffee is good, and every bit as pricey as the upscale coffee barons. The food is decent. But it can get crazy busy at lunch or coffee time."}
{"text":"Good coffee, good selection of sweets and pastries!! Wonderful lattes and frozen drinks too! Great service."}
