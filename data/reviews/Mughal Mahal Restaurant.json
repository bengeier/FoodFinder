{"text":"I would never go here again. The service was friendly, but the food didn't taste that good. We had tons of leftovers but no one wanted to touch it."}
{"text":"I don't know if the bad reviews below actually know what they are taking about. I challenge you to find a Vindaloo anywhere in this town for their price. Best Vindaloo flavor I have had. Have eaten there every month for the last seven years."}
{"text":"The food is terrible.  And expensive. For that kind of money, food better be good.  However they dont seem to care. Not sure how they run this business."}
{"text":"I went here for their chunne bhature. I liked them. Their mango lassi was really good. Everything else was blah: dry old tandoori chicken....stale salad. Ambiance is very dated and then y have this nice elderly uncle ji serving you. Poor guy. We tipped him fairly."}
{"text":"Was at a trade show across the street and was looking for a restaurant for lunch. Beyond amazing food. We had a variety of dishes and they were all delicious. My coworkers and I came back the next day and each bought food to bring home to our families because it was that great."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday evening with a group of 6.   Now, let me start off by saying that I've gotten take out Chole Bhatura from here in the past and it's always been amazing. But this time, the food was not the best.   We decided to start off with:  Chaat Papri  - standard, but pretty small quantity  Dahi Puri  - just ok, they were stuffed pretty well though  Chicken Tikka  - The absolute WORST, it had very little flavour, not colour to it and is definitely tasted like it had been sitting out for awhile. You could also tell it was definitely NOT made in a Tandoor.   Goat Kebabs - Pretty good   Paneet Pakora - Just ok   Mixed Vegetable Pakora - Good   When it came time to order our main, we went with:  Boneless Butter Chicken  - they had a special version of this dish, one with dark meat, and one with white meat. We got the white meat version and it was actually really good.   Chole Bhatura  - Good value for money, but the chole are not like what they used to be a few years ago.  Chana Kulcha  - A really big thali with one medium sized kulcha, served with chole, aloo, raita and salad. It was average.   Naans - I honestly don't think they have a tandoor here because they naans were definitely not tandoor ki naan. You can easily tell they baked it in something like a pizza oven and then tried to finish it off on a pan to get it darker.   Overall, I would not recommend dining in, as the service is extremely slow. They really only have a few a employees and you can tell they're stretched pretty thin with the main kitchen, takeout orders and table service.   We had a very nice older gentleman take our order, but you could tell he wasn't an expert in the items they served. We asked him what the difference between the Kulcha and the Amritsari Kulcha was and he kept saying it was a \"secret recipe\" We actually just wanted to know what vegetable it was stuffed with. He brushed us off so many times, we had to go to the takeout counter to ask another employee.    It's really frustrating because this place has been around for so many years, but the quality of the food and service provided are decreased significantly in the last few years.   Highly doubtful I will return."}
{"text":"Love the channa bathura here. Super delicious. They also have excellent thalis and iced coffee. Keer is a perfect way to end the meal - light and perfect sweetness. Usually come here for a quick casual weekend lunch. Priced very well it's a no brainer. There's an uncle ji that always serves us - super warm and friendly gives the experience an authentic touch."}
