{"text":"My husband and I come here often.. Mostly because my husband LOVES it.. I'm not big on Mexican food, but they do have options that are not spicy and I like. They are really fast and they have good customer service. You know its good when there is a line out the door on a Thursday night!"}
{"text":"I write this review with disappointment because it is not pleasurable to give even my worst restaurant experiences two stars let alone one but, in this case, one star is sadly accurate.  I have visited El Paso Mexican Grill twice (which is two more times than I care to mention).  Obviously, my first experience was dreadful but I tend not to badmouth anyone based off one experience.  However, my second experience was so equally horrible that I won't ever go back nor could I ever with good intentions recommend El Paso to anyone, not even my worst enemy.
So, here is my accurate, candid review of El Paso Mexican Grill which I ate at twice in the past two months:
The positives:  The restaurant itself has a cool layout in that one can watch the traffic from high above Washington Road.  Also, there is a reasonably sizable deck which would be a great place to have a margarita or more with some friends (just order drinks and appetizers ... you'll regret anything more).   El Paso's guacamole is very good.  Its not the best I've had, not even the best in the area, but it is good.  They have an OUTSTANDING tomatillo sauce.  It is a brownish, roasted tomatillo with ample spice (heat) and a terrific taste.  They should be very proud of their tomatillo sauce.  They stock Jarritos soda. There are friendly employees, kind waiters who look the part for a place masquerading as a Mexican restaurant, quick service, and the traditional decorations Pittsburghers expect to see in a place with this genre.  
The negatives:  To be upfront and honest,  if Taco Bell is the \"Mexican\" McDonald's then El Paso (at its best) is the \"Mexican\" Eat n Park (at its worst). The menu is \"hokie\" and the food is atrocious.  Actually, if I could find a word which is worse than atrocious, it is that word.  To elaborate, we walk in to El Paso and are nicely welcomed and immediately seated.  About five minutes later garden variety chips and the typical very mild, fresh, red salsa was served. Next, our drink orders taken.  When the waiter brought our drinks I asked if they had a spicier salsa to which he replied yes.  He brought me tomatillo sauce at no extra charge but proceeded to explain to me that this salsa, which is made in house, is free at El Paso but costs $2.00 extra at El Campesino (where he used to work).  I assume he meant El Campesino in McMurray which is a typical mid-Atlantic \"Mexican style\" restaurant of MUCH better quality than El Paso.  Anyways,  I ate the salsa with boring yellow corn chips which were from a bag.  My friend and I ordered our food, I ordered a typical Mexican staple of enchiladas verde and my friend ordered Flautas which were labeled Tacquitos Mexicana.  We waited for about ten minutes as we munched on our bag chips.  A quick turn around from ordering to receiving my meal always throws red flags into the air and for good reason.  The tacquitos were extremely greasy (2 beef - dry roast beef and 2 chicken - which were a chicken tinga and looked halfway decent) served on a bed of shredded bag lettuce, a scoop of sour cream (undoubtedly straight from a Daisy container) and guacamole which, in certain places,  was actually brown from oxidation and warm temperature.  
I felt bad as I watched my friend eat the tacquitos with grease dripping from the fried tortilla shells.  I could not believe that any restaurant outside of Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares would even consider serving a plate such as that let alone actually bring it to table.  Arron Sanchez would have flipped his lid for disgracing his native culture's food in such a heinous way. On to my meal.  I was served three pseudo-corn shell enchiladas, crispy and tough on the ends, and saturated wet in the middle, smothered (not covered but smothered three times removed) in cheese of an unknown origin.  It was white cheese of some sort but it was tasteless and not identifiable.  There was some green watery verde sauce on the ends of my enchilada mush but the sauce has no texture, no consistency, no taste and was well ... as thin as water.  I was also served yellow \"Mexican\" rice which either came from a box or someone else's plate.  I kid not, this stuff had to have been a few days old.  Stale, tasteless, with a few thawed peas mixed in.  Unbelievable.  And, finally, there was a small pile of shredded bag lettuce, wilted and brown on the ends, underneath a scoop of Daisy and a slice of tomato.  That's it.  That was my meal. That is what they set in front of my and expected me to lie about enjoying and actually pay for.  ANY EMPLOYEE IN THE RESTAURANT who looked at me could tell that I know this is not Mexican food nor was it edible food.  They should feel embarrassed for themselves because I sure am embarrassed for them.  Anyways, I scraped off 90% of the cheese, ate the parts of the enchiladas which were edible, paid the bill and left never to return again. They never even asked how my meal was ... they knew.  They knew, I knew.  NEVER recommended!"}
{"text":"Lori was out bartender she was awesome this place is fun! Margaritas are amamazzzing! I'll be back"}
{"text":"My family absolutely loves this place! The food is excellent and very fresh. The portions were good and the service is fantastic. High marks for the fresh salsa they provide with chips as soon as you are seated.

Our family has widely varying tastes, but there's something here for everyone"}
{"text":"Good food & service, for what it is. The staff is regularly friendly and it works for family dinners as well"}
{"text":"Was hesitant to try this place because it's in the strip mall. But I was pleasantly suprised! Very clean, great authentic food and atmosphere. The waiter was the best I ever had at any restaurant, ever. He never let my drink glass go empty. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Tasty stuff. Like the pollo fundido the best. The place is nice and clean and has beer too. A nice lunch option for under an hour and under 10 bucks."}
{"text":"My favorite mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh! Large delicious portions. I always leave stuffed. Coming from a Verrrrrry large mexican family I def recommend. The only food in the area that reminds me of home."}
{"text":"Food is way more than fairly priced for the flavor and the portions that you receive. The kitchen was willing to customize an order for me and I definitely will return"}
{"text":"Customer service was a joke. Kept the door locked during business hours and didn't have the courtesy to inform they were closed and instead chose to peek from the kitchen area. Never going back again."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going here from the time they first opened.  I don't know why but the last two visits the food and service was not good.  There has been a big decline in the quality of the food served.  The waiters that were there a year ago are all gone and when we were there for lunch the last time there was one person taking orders, delivering food, and working the cash register.  No Mas...."}
{"text":"I'll note the other one star review of this place relates to the coupon policy. So before I dive in, I'll say that if they honored their own coupons, this would be a 3* place. $8.50 for a combo plate that includes three items, food is decent and comes out very fast, service is average.

They have been in the Entertainment book for a while, in fact you can print out coupons for them from the website, which I did today. They have single handedly added a new restriction to the coupons of $25 minimum purchase. Just because they want to. Now, that's bad enough (and 3-2 star drop) but then the waiter simply rang me up at the pre-coupon price and said 'Come back next time and spend more!' 

If they had any sense of customer service, they could have informed of the policy and I could have ordered dessert, which would have easily taken me over the coupon discount amount. But obviously they just didn't want to honor the coupon.

Well, I hope it was worth it. Since the waiter himself decided to simply ignore the coupon and ring me up, a couple bucks came out of his tip. I usually overtip with discount coupons and would have easily ended up spending the amount of the discount. Instead, they lost a customer for life (and I do live nearby) and I can only hope that fellow Yelpers will think twice before going here. I hope the couple bucks they scammed out of me was worth it."}
{"text":"It is hard to find a decent Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh, but this one works. Have been here twice and both my husband and I ordered different items.  The first time we sat on the deck, which unfortunately is very loud due to Washington Rd/19 being right there.  The second time we sat inside which was better. We also wanted to see if service was better inside than out.  Sorry to say it was not. We had a different server each time and both were nice but slow. It takes a bit of time to have someone initially come over then be consistently attentive afterward.  

On a good note, we ordered a pitcher of \"Texas\" margaritas each time and they are really good. They would be excellent if there was more lime juice and less orange, but that is personal preference. 

Living in Texas for 3 years and not finding a good chili relleno, I was happily surprised to find an authentic one on the menu. Unlike a previous review, my pepper was not \"oily\" at all and the batter was very light. On a different day I ordered mole' enchiladas and they were very good. The mole' sauce had depth of flavor and the chicken was tender and juicy. My husband always goes for a combo plate and said everything was good except for the tamale. Nothing special. Too much masa to meat ratio. I tasted the red sauce on the tamale and enchilada and it was delicious!

Overall this is solid Mexican restaurant that needs some server education."}
{"text":"First time here. Bad customer service, and food is not great. Ordered the Carne asada and steak was burnt. Disappointed and won't come back. No black beans on menu. Chicken fajitas was bland, flavorless."}
{"text":"My wife and I loved this place when we first went years back. Food was great and came quick. But it seems each time we go the quality of the food and service declines. I get the Special Yolanda's every time. Just chicken enchiladas. At first the sauce on them was amazing. It made the dish. But each time we went the sauce was different. We went tonight and the sauce was a bland watery tomato sauce. My wife wasn't impressed with her dish either. She got the chimichangas. The cheese was watery and the refried beans looked like they had been sitting out for a while. The top of the beans was dry and cracked. The staff barely talks to you. But I think for most of them English is a second language. Still though. This place used to be pretty busy but was not even half full tonight which is a a Saturday. Plus they were slapped with numerous health code violations earlier this year. Most likely won't be back."}
{"text":"An inexpensive authentic Mexican restaurant. Great food, fast service and awesome atmosphere. Flavors are great in the food, and the menu is huge, something for everyone, even the kiddos. I know I'll visit again."}
{"text":"El Paso is the latest restaurant to take a turn in a space that has seen a few concepts come and go - some fairly quickly.  Luckily, we already knew this to be a good one from positive experiences at the Chippewa location many years ago.

We had a very friendly, attentive, and funny server.  The fajitas were well seasoned and my chile relleno was quite good.

We'll definitely plan on coming back here."}
{"text":"Went  here  for the lunch they other day!  They immediately brought out chips and salsa.  Ordered lunch #1, my friend she ordered the chicken quesadilla combo ! It was fantastic!!! I had a cooked green pepper with sauce and cheese , so soft and tasty!! Server was very \"Attentive\", and \"friendly!\"  Give the place a \"thumbs up!!!  Reasonable too!"}
{"text":"This a lunch place. We were in for dinner and I felt cheated. Portion sizes are way small and they try to throw in a lot of onion and peppers in to hide that they are skimping on the meat. I ordered carnitas and I got one scoop of burned meat mixed with half raw onions. The remaining 3/4 of my plate was refried beans and rice. Gave it three stars because it was tasty, they  had queso fresco and was tremendously better than the slop they call Mexican food in WI!"}
{"text":"A group of friends and I have been meeting here weekly for many months. The food is always good, prices are also inexpensive and the service is good.

In my opinion isn't about as perfect of a Mexican place as you can ask for. Good chips, good salsa and good food, either local sports or soccer on the TVs. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"El Paso Mexican Grill is excellent! I can not say enough wonderful things about this restaurant. Real authentic Mexican cuisine, amazing service, quick and let's not forget the unbeatable prices. The chips were served warm with homemade salsa that was great. We had a quest appetizer as well that was also great. For my meal, I had the fajita quesadilla & it was delicious! My husband had one of the combination dishes and really enjoyed it as well. We got two dinners, an appetizer and 3 jumbo margaritas for 50 bucks. Can't beat it! Our servers were so friendly and always there for refills, clearing plates and making sure we were okay. We were also in and out in under an hour on a Saturday night. I will certainly return to El Paso and would recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"We love this place!  It is fast, authentic, and inexpensive . As soon as you sit down, someone puts a bottomless bowl of tortilla chips and salsa on your table.  The wait staff appears immediately taking your drink order.  Margaritas are great!  Low on ice and lots of alcohol.  The drinks come out in under 3 minutes. 
 Wide selection of the typical Mexican fare.  Have tried many, and all are good.  And it is also comes quickly.  The staff come by frequently to check on you, take away plates, bring more drinks, etc...
El Paso is a sure thing"}
{"text":"Fresh warm tortilla chips, great salsa, the burrito durango is out of this world! I'll be back tomorrow just to shove my face in that phenominal plate of awesomeness!"}
{"text":"The food at El Paso is delicious. The carnitas dishes are fantastic. The staff is personable and always willing to help with recommendations. I'm a sensitive celiac and have not been \"glutened\", always alerting my server and asking for corn tortillas. It's great having a go to Mexican restaurant in the South Hills."}
{"text":"I was here not too long ago and was disappointed. I am all about supporting local and family run businesses.  I wanted to give this place a second change.  I hate to say, I don't think I'll be returning.  The margaritas tasted like a watered down powdered lime drink.  The nachos came out in about two minutes and the cheese wasn't even melted.  I hope they make improvements.  They are nice people and I don't want them to go out of business."}
{"text":"This is coming from someone who doesn't normally eat Mexican food. Nothing wrong with it I just don't really like spicy foods. However I have to say my experience here was an enjoyable one. The atmosphere was calm and quiet for a Friday night and the food was delicious even for me. We did get one meal come to the table wrong but mistakes happen. Definitely gonna return again soon."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go out for Mexican food more than any other cuisine and we both agreed this is our new spot. The prices are very good and the portions are huge. I always have a second meal to take home. I just tried the margaritas this time and they were my favorite to date. The perfect amount of sweet, tart, and booze. Very smooth and the perfect complement to the food. We have had burritos, enchiladas, fajitas, and chorizo queso dip. All were fantastic. And I can't wait to see the murals on the walls finished. It's a great spot."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Mexican place in the area. The food is good and the service is even better. My husband and I have been here several times since they opened and will continue to go back!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was excellent. Best Mexican restaurant I have eaten at in a long time. I will be back."}
{"text":"Oh how I miss home! This will be my new place to get my fix on Mexican food! I just recently started eating differently and was afraid I wasn't going to be able to enjoy foods I love, well to my surprise they have a vegetarian section on the menu!! Lots to choose from including my favorite chalupa!! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican restaurants in the burgh! Having been born and raised in Southern California, I LIKE MEXICAN FOOD! Over the years we've tried different places around town, very few impress!  After our first visit to El Paso, we were hooked.  The decor and atmosphere are par for the average Mexican restaurant but the food is outstanding. One of my gauges when judging a Mexican restaurant is the chips and salsa.  At El Paso the chips are always hot and fresh and the salsa has a bold but smooth flavor. 

When it comes to the menu, there's a lot to choose from but my absolute favorite is the Pollo Con Crema.  The chicken is tender, the sauce is creamy and full of flavor. (and who doesn't love hot flour tortillas!)  The tacos are fresh and the burritos are big. 

The service is generally pretty good.  The food always arrives quickly (and hot!), it's those pop refills and special requests that sometimes take a little bit longer.

Check it out - you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for lunch today. The parking wasn't bad at all. The restaurant was not crowded at all. We were seated right away.

The brought chips and salsa over right away. And the server came over once but we weren't ready to order. We finally got our orders in. I got the crab quesadilla and my boy friend had a burrito. Both dishes were very large and filled us both up. I didn't really love it because there was not much crab and you could tell it was imitation and not very good. The little crab that was in it was clumped together . My quesadilla came with rice and beans. We didn't even finish all the food. We also ordered cheese dip and we always had chips at the table. 

My boyfriend is pretty regular here and he loves it. I would come again and not get the quesadilla."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and very authentic. It can be a little hard to understand them sometimes, but it's worth it. Also, the place doesn't get too crowded because it is in a strip mall and people don't understand how good it is. I have only good things to say about this place!"}
{"text":"Not good! We live down the street and thought we would try it. Sorry we did. Food was tasteless. We got the nachos and quesadillas. I don't know how you mess that up! The beef was like something from a pot roast which was ok, but not in my mexican food. I ordered a $17.00 margarita and it was terrible!!!!. Best thing about it was the chips and salsa. Sadly we won't be back."}
{"text":"Honestly- for me the best of the best Mexican places !!!!! First -the balcony-so romantic and nice, feels like you are somewhere else, not in the city for sure!! All lights at night just make you feel worm and comfyfood is amazing , guys are really good to! I even went there for my birthday with friends: everyone was full and happy after \"grando\" margaritas and huge dishes!! Stuff is great too-there were songs, music and a hatwhat can I say, just go and try-you'll have tones of emotions and some fun too"}
{"text":"El Paso Mexican Grill has been in Bridgeville for awhile now, and I have never visited there! My boyfriend was at Rumfish Grille for happy hour on Friday night and was planning on picking us up dinner. I knew this place was right next door so I suggested stopping there. 

The menu was hard to find online (maybe a lot of people don't order take out from here?) I don't even know if I ordered from the right menu to be honest! I ended up just ordering soft tacos- they come with 3 so I got 2 chicken and 1 beef. Chris wanted the \"Cielo Mar y Tierra\" it was some kind of mixed skillet. I also ordered us chips and guacamole. My tacos arrived really soggy and Chris's meal wasn't even what I ordered! The guacamole also wasn't very good and didn't seem homemade- how can ya even mess up guac?!

Last, when  I called to order, all of the workers were extremely rude. I talked to about 3 different people on the phone when I called which was also kind of weird. I can think of about 15 other Mexican places I would go before coming back to El Paso."}
{"text":"We go here often enough to know this place is good. It's not overly expensive and they usually have a coupon in mailers. I've yet to order anything from here that wasn't tasty."}
{"text":"This place fills the void for good Mexican in the south hills. Great food good service"}
{"text":"El Paso is our favorite Mexican  restaurant. Great food, large portions, the best chips and salsa we've ever had. Nice people and a clean place to enjoy a nice meal. The price is reasonable as well."}
{"text":"El Paso serves us as my substitute for the now-closed Cinco.  It's pretty good.  It's your standard Mexican peasant food restaurant (burritos, tacos, fajitas, enchiladas...) You get your chips and salsa.  While Cinco had a taste profile that swung more towards the Arizona restaurants I was used to, El Paso satisfies my craving for Mexican in the South Hills much better than most."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed walking into the restaurant was the smell of disinfectant. I like a clean restaurant as much as the next person but don't particularly like the scent of harsh cleaner.
Luckily the food smelled better!
The chips and salsa arrived quickly. The chips were fresh, corn and not salty (which I have to avoid). The salsa was also fresh and had a light bite.
I ordered the single grilled chicken quesadilla with a side salad which was a right sized meal, no leftovers. The salad, oddly enough, had no dressing, but I was able to make do with leftover salsa.
The quesadilla had almost too much melted queso (not too much if you love cheese).
I had a regular sized lime margarita (no salt) which was on the watery side.
My son had chori pollo which he enjoyed quite a bit.
Overall, there were enough positives , combined with a low bill, that we decided we would return and try again.

{"text":"I used to like this place until today.

1. Hair in the salsa..  gross but I moved on.
2. My order was wrong. ok. not a big deal but
2. Did not get any drink refills. Not nice.
4. I told my waiter that I didn't like my food because the order was wrong and he came back showed me his ticket  - he wrote it down wrong so I dont care about seeing the ticket. He should have just apologized and moved on. The customer is always right I didn't say that but he should know....AND then he yelled a complaint about me when he went to the kitchen. (I could hear him)  Not nice. I left hungry and angry.  Wont be back."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant have to go in for work out at LA fitness. I'm kind of picky about Mexican restaurants if this is my new favorite in this part of town my dinner consisted of the camera nice with white sauce it was delicious. The wait staff was excellent they brought the licious chips with salsayou can spice that salsa up to your level of enjoyment. I will be coming back here again and again.
The prices are reasonable. I got 12 good size shrimp with my order. I think that's more than fair.
They favor the spices of Quintana Roo."}
{"text":"Decidely average. I've been to El Paso a few times due to the location. I have never been very disappointed but I've also never been impressed. Last Friday,  I went to El Paso with 3 adults and one baby at 8:30 for a quick dinner. The restaurant was about half full and we got a table right away. We ordered guacamole for an appetizer and I got the Chicken and Shrimp entree. The guac seemed fresh but was lacking in spice. Our entrees came out quickly and were satisfactory though my vegetables were obviously a mix of frozen carrots, broccoli and cauliflower. Can you say green giant? Also, the service is usually adequate though the wait staff often has some difficulty understanding any special orders/requests. For what it is, a small mexiacan place in a strip mall, it lives up to standards. However, if you're looking for good authentic mexican, it's worth the drive to El Campesino in Robinson."}
{"text":"Fooled yet again. This restaurant has great reviews but didn't fit the bill. Bland  guacamole. We saved it with the picante sauce served with the chips. Beef taco very dry. In their favor meal prices were very reasonable. But not enough for us to return."}
{"text":"Not really sure if any of the folks that have this a good review have every had Mexican food before, but they may want to try some... somewhere else.
We tried this today for lunch, wanted to sit out side on the deck and have a drink and sample some of the food.
We were the only ones there for lunch, which is usually not a good sign, but we pushed on.
We sat outside and ordered two  margaritas on the rocks. They were ok, not great just a standard mix with some house tequila. The waiter was about as friendly as a cactus.. never smiled never engaged us never asked us anything besides what we wanted. So we thought we would try the quesadillas to start and go from there
They have a grilled quesadilla that is two dollars more than the standard, so we thought we we would try one beef one chicken to see what it was like.
It was literally a few pieces of chicken with some shredded cheese sprinkled inside and queso poured on top... period
No lettuce, no tomato, no quac no salsa, nothing.
Needless to say, we didn't order anything else.
I would consider giving it a second shot for dinner, but with Totopo only a short drive further, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went to El Paso for dinner last night with my husband and two kids (age 2.5 & 4.5).  We walked in a stood around for a while trying to figure out if we were supposed to seat ourselves or be seated.  Someone noticed us after a few minutes and seated us.  Chip and salsa were good and they refilled it for us twice.  We didn't order any drinks but happy hour is 4-7 and they had some good drink specials.  A Corona would have been $2.99 and house margarita was $4.  The service was friendly and polite but very slow.  We waited for our food for a long time.  My husband and I both ordered enchiladas and we both liked them, especially the refried beans.  The kids meals were a good size and only $4.50.  Both of our kids got a cheese quesadilla, taco and french fries.  Overall we liked the food. The service just needs some work but I guess that's to be expected with a new restaurant."}
{"text":"Look. It is hard for me to comprehend a bad review of this place. From the seating to the chips and salsa to the margaritas to the main course through to the flan. Positively brilliant. Could not have been better. Bitching about coupons and oooo I used to live in LA...give me a break...this is the real deal done correct-a-mundo!"}
{"text":"Strawberry margarita was great. 2 tables of entitle moo parents and their bad kids kept throwing food and bowls on the ground and swinging a monkey stuffed toy at us

I guess this attracts families , we wont be back.

Slow service and unenthusiastic server"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time last night.
This place is awesome!! From the chips & salsa to the margaritas to the tacos, fajita burrito & enchiladas all excellent!!!
Jesus was our server very helpful & attentive will definitely be back & recommend to others"}
{"text":"First time in, great service, all smiling faces.  Great food, presentation was on point. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The staff is so quick it's amazing!!!! They are all so friendly . Although they do have heavy accents, I have never had any trouble understanding them. And they normally know exactly what your talking about without you needing to get into too much detail, which is pretty impressive. 
I am a regular there, and their food has yet to disappoint me. There is nothing on their menu that you won't love, that's guaranteed."}
{"text":"Okay, kids.  This place is what it is.  Americanized, greasy fake mexican combos.  

Frankly, I love this place.  It's super cheap, cheesy and tasty.  It's also super quick and easy.

Adjust your expectations, order a texas margarita (still super cheap) and eat some freshly fried chips.  You'll love it."}
{"text":"So happy they finally put a good restaurant at this location.  Even happier it is Mexican.  The deck area of El Paso is a great place to have some authentic margaritas and tacos.  On top of the great atmosphere, the service is always friendly and fast, and the food is very good.

The queso here is really good and is a great starter.  Not too runny and not too thick.  It's easy to fill up on though.  I also like their salsa, which has a little kick to it.  

The last time I was here I went with the enchiladas verdes.  Their green salsa topping on the enchiladas was delicious and made for a great dish.  In the past I have had the cheesesteak burrito which is probably my favorite dish.  They also have some really good tacos, with plenty of variety."}
{"text":"This review is actually for the new one on the Bethel Park/USC line. Stopped in for lunch today. I suppose it's fine if your thing is the standard combo plate menu that 98% of Pittsburgh Mexican restaurants share. I don't get why someone would open up yet another one of those types of places - what's the vision if you're not going to do something different, or even just better? Menu had no seafood other than shrimp done the usual ways and bottom-feeding tilapia. I had the grilled shrimp in chipotle. It was merely OK. No real bite or depth to the chipotle sauce. Shrimp were \"grilled\" I suppose on a griddle, as there were no grill marks. No real reason to go back, but I doubt I'm their demographic as I'd be more up for a Bayless-type of menu."}
{"text":"This place is bright, cozy, and welcoming. The management and wait staff are always looking out for ways to improve your dining experience. I have placed several phone orders as well, and they are on point! Always fast, and always delicious.

Pros: food is fantastic, atmosphere is very comfortable. 
Cons: location leaves something to be desired, and that something is better parking."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Mexican food you'd be better off going to chipotle. I ordered the Sante Fe chicken salad, what I received was seasoned chicken cutlet that looked like a two year old ripped it apart on top of a bed of hot shredded lettuce with  peppers, onions, and mushrooms that were sautéed. It also came with a fried tortilla bowl filled with guacamole, pico, and sour cream. I am displeased because I just wanted a simple salad. Also, when we called to order they had no delivery driver for the day, and when we went to pick up the order they had no change for a cash transaction."}
{"text":"I love traditional Mexican food, so when I came across El Paso, I was excited for another choice for when I was thinking beans and rice. 
I wasn't overly impressed by El Paso- the interior was clean and had the usual sombrero's on the wall. The staff was just OK- they took our order and quickly brought our food, which was my minimum for good service.
I was more impressed with the actual food. The menu has lots of good Mexican staples, and some things I've never seen before. For my meal, I tried the chicken with sour cream sauce. I can't remember the actual name of the entree, but if you go, get it. It's small bites of roasted chicken in a sour cream sauce flavored with Mexican spices, and accompanied by rice and beans and hot tortilla shells. I've never had anything like it, especially since sour cream sauce scared me, but it was really good. My wife had the chile rellenos, which were prepared in the more traditional style with the egg sauce on top. 
I had an opportunity to try several of my friends' dishes, and they were all tasty, but a little different then my usual Mexican hangout, El Campesino. If you're looking for something a little different in traditional Mexican food and you're not big on ambiance, give El Paso a try."}
{"text":"A mixed bag, I've been going here for awhile but I'm liking it less and less.
The short version:
+good food
+decent view
+decent atmosphere and decorations
-Promotions they use to get people in the door aren't worth it
-Parking is mildly annoying
-Staff are overworked or just a few don't pay much attention.

First, their parking lot is tiny, and they have about 4 signs (instead of signs with daily specials) warning patrons not to park across the street or else they will be towed... but they have an agreement to let people park at a church across the street and about 3 doors down. This has always been an issue with this location even before it became El Paso's... but it's offset by the view. There are big windows by the bar and a decently large patio overlooking a small valley with lots of trees but also noisy 4-lane Rt 19.
The menu is fairly large and includes seafood and vegetarian options. If you don't KNOW your Mexican food, a large part of the menu lacks descriptions and the rest is described in generic ingredients. Lately I usually get the Cozumel burrito. The Cozumel is tasty, with tender moist pulled pork, caramelized peppers and onion slivers like a fajita, a light cheese sauce, and a large enough portion for a little leftovers, no sides.
On my most recent visit, I decided to order a $2.99 draft (regular size, not tall) XX beer and the $10.99 Cozumel, my wife got a chipotle-honey shrimp dish that she thought was a really good balance of sweet and spicy. She had to leave early, and I thought it was nice that one of the bartenders asked if I was happy, if I'd been there before (I usually eat outside, and bring friends). Our actual server never asked if I needed more water even though I was 3/4 finished before the food arrived, and I noticed he charged me for a $4 drink on the receipt, and our meal was about $36 after tax.
On a previous visit, a different server tried to decline a coupon (which said it was good till the end of next month) for a free dessert, but after a mood-killing wait to talk to a manager they brought out a really small slice of snickers pie. I don't know if they cut a normal slice in half, or if their portions really are just that small.

It's not that cheap or convenient, and the food is good but not special, and it's a shame because I feel like it was a better restaurant when they first opened. As it stands, I'm starting to consider other places on the lower or higher end of prices."}
{"text":"Came here on one of our lunch dates and have great food and service. Will be back. Get the chorizo steak tacos. So good"}
{"text":"I am very happy by our lunch experience. I have been wanting to try this place out for some time. The restaurant is a lot bigger then i thought it would be. They have a separate bar area as you walk in. Then a dining room to your right. To your left, on the other side of the bar, is the outside dining, however closed for the season. The server was very attentive, as it was not very busy at the 11am time we were there. 
The chips were fresh, the salad was thin, but was tasteful. The lunch selection was very long. I chose the number 1 lunch special, a Chile relleno and taco with a salad and beans. The Chile relleno was big, but wasn't my favorite. The children's taco, rice and beans was very big for a child, not complaining. 
The other person with me had the lunch taco salad. It was in a taco shell and a good size, with a choice of beef or chicken. The person with me said it was good. The lettuce and tomatoes were fresh. 
I will be looking forward to coming back and trying out more options, as there are many."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with the menu and the authentic Mexican food at El Paso.  The food was cooked perfectly and the serving size was right on.  Did I mention that the margarita was a nice addition to the dinner.  I will definitely go back, maybe even once a week for lunch.

I would only recommend that they turn the TV's off during the dinner hours.  It was rather distracting."}
{"text":"This newly opened Mexican restaurant is located on N. Highland Road, about half-way between the Un-Common Market, and Trader Joes (It's a little bit hard to notice, as the building sits towards the back of the parking lot).  The dining room windows and outdoor deck give you a view of busy Washington Road.  Not unlike other El Paso Mexican Grills in the area, they offer an Americanized version of Mexican food.  They also have a full bar, and I noticed a frozen Margarita machine, and a few Mexican beers on tap.  The service was good, the server was very polite, and the food arrived quickly after ordering, including complimentary chips and salsa, but I wasn't very fond of my lunch today.  I had the lunch special #1 which included a Chile Relleño, Beef Taco, Gucamole Salad, and Re-fried Beans.  The taco meat and the fried pepper were very oily, and both left heavy puddles of oil on the plates (see photo of my plates, and you will notice the oil coming out of the food before I even touched them).  There also really wasn't a lot of flavor in the food, except for the oil.  I probably would've rated one more star if the food wasn't so oily, but overall, I just thought it was meh, and didn't even finish my plate."}
{"text":"Solid Mexican food (for a strip mall in Bridgeville! If you are looking for fancy or upscale, keep looking. This has more of a family friendly atmosphere. It has a wide vegetarian selection. Service was faster then the speed of light and El Paso has very friendly and helpful staff. I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"El Paso has only been open for a course le of months. It's in a bit of an odd little cation but I will go just about anywhere for Mexican food. I pulled in and there was one parking space left. That's usually a good sign. I wasn't able to eat in so I was curious how the take out would be. The host and hostess were quick to greet me and give me a menu. I ordered chicken enchiladas for myself. I sat down to wait but I didn't have to wait lol no. What I saw of the restaurant looked nice. The servers seemed friendly and speedy. 
When I got home I was worried that I might have to reheat the food. I was wrong. It was still hot. You opened your container and the steam and aroma came out-mmmmmm yummy. I had ordered chicken enchiladas. The chicken was shredded and moist. I really enjoyed the flavor of their sauce. It wasn't too spicy and had a slow roasted taste. They threw in chips and salsa which was a nice surprise. The chips were thin and crispy and the salsa had a nice flavor. 
I'll be going back and taking friends. Their margaritas looked inviting."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the portions were gigantic. I really liked how everyone gets their own salsa bowl so the kids weren't fighting over the same bowl. The food came out really quick, but was hot and tasted fresh. Would've had 5 stars but the fact of no soap dispenser in the restroom made me wonder how sanitary the staff handling my food really is."}
{"text":"I am always skeptical of Mexican food in Pittsburgh, I have been to too many mediocre places. Tried ElPaso for lunch today and brought my family back for dinner. Hands down the best Mexican place I eaten at since leaving the West coast. Yum!"}
{"text":"First  off, it's not what one would call \"authentic\" Mexican food but it's really good!
I've come here almost once a week and I love it!
great prices, fast service, great margaritas, you can't go wrong!
My favorite mexican food place in the area hands down!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service. The server barely speaks and just mumbles under his breath. He is also very rude and aggressive. My mom ordered another drink bc she didn't like hers, he yelled at her saying she still had to pay (which she had planned on it, she just wanted a different drink). My mom said she knew that and she would pay and he walked away. He came back with her drink and my mom told him he was acting very rude. He didn't respond and when he came to get our bill he slammed his hand on the table so hard to grab it, didn't say a word, and walked away. He actually said 0 words to us after my mom ordered a new drink. 

I've never seen someone act that way when they absolutely weren't provoked at all. It was crazy. 

The food and drinks are mediocre too. What you'd expect from a dingy Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here. It was a Saturday evening and we made reservations. ( not sure we needed to though. ) We were seated immediately upon arrival. Our waiter was excellent and was quick to respond to any of our requests. There were 5 of us at the table and we all enjoyed our food. We agreed that this was going to be our number one pick for Mexican restaurants. I have nothing negative say about our experience."}
{"text":"I base the legitimacy of a Mexican restaurant on whether or not they offer chorizo. So this place is -- as the young people say -- legit. 

Take that how you will. My very unscientific and uncultured account of this restaurant was satisfactory. It seemed to be authentic and really embraced this style of Latin cooking, serving sizzling fajitas in a cast iron pan to the table. 

It wasn't the best Mexican restaurant I've ever been to in Pa. That's El Toro in Erie, Pa (RIP). But it's a better option than Mad Mex or Taco Bell. 

I would recommend this place if you're in the area and jonesing for some spicy treats."}
{"text":"We are new to Bridgeville and we absolutely love this place.  Great food.  Good service.  Good prices.  Love it!"}
{"text":"El Paso is an inexpensive authentic mexican restaurant.  Above each table/booth there is a mural, that I found out, portrays Dia dl los Muertos, the holiday in which families remember there deceased relatives...OK.

I noticed one large TV screen with the sound on mute, was told they play Mexican soccer games.

They do have margaritas, beer and I think Sangria.  The place was very crowded.  

Service was good.  Immediately received warm chips and salsa.  Salsa was good but like mine a little spicier.  Of course after the meal, found out they do have a more spicy salsa, if you ask.  

Had a taco, enchilada and beans.  The taco was bland, came with meat that was very bland and a little overcooked, white cheese (white american?) and lettuce.  The enchilada was better with a zesty red sauce."}
{"text":"We just love it here. Of course I remember going here with my mum when it was The Living Room. So I'm nostalgic. But, we have a toddler and it's always a process to go out to eat. They are always more than patient. However, today we had a crabby toddler. While scattering to get all of our toddler taming toys and what not together I knocked over an entire glass of water. Obviously mortified, I found someone to tell them. I would have cleaned it myself. They made us feel like it was no big deal at all and even chased us down in the parking lot bc we left his hoodie there. It's also a plus that when I ask for fresh jalapeños they bring out fresh ones. Not pickled ones like every other place. Ha!"}
{"text":"the menu that is linked from Urbanspoon is for two other El Paso Mexican restaurants. the restaurant in Bridgeville claimed that they have NO website and they are NOT related to the other two El Paso Mexican rest. at http://www.mexicanrestaurantfinder.com/elpasomexicangrill/ho me-beaver-falls-east-liverpool.html

if you look at the menu from the link above and the one at Bridgeville restaurant they are the same! different format but the Dinner Combos are exactly the same!

well we printed the coupon from the website link, showed our waiter, he said they take that at the cashier when you check out. we go to check out and they say that is NOT their coupon and we don't have a website only a $5 coupon of some sort... and that is not it. they were very rude about it as well...

food was bland. Just coming from Los Cabos in Bloomfield restaurant last month... this place was a let down. service was fast but the food was just OK at best. the salsa for my taste was fine which was mild but the rest in my group preferred hot. so they added hot sauce to it.

read on other review here on YELP that they have a hotter salsa if requested but they did not offer. also the server was fast but RUDE. he slammed down the salsa bottle and chips when first delivered. no apologies for almost splashing me with the salsa when that happened.

It looks like the same menu as the Ray Azteca Restaurant menu in Sommerset, PA as well. I wonder if they order their menus from some generic Mexican restaurant website...

Bottom line, poor server attitude, no customer service when their server did not tell us that it is not their coupon when we ordered and showed him... and bland food.

Had combo 29 and it was bland and not as good as Ray Azteca Mexican and not in the same league as the Bloomfield Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"About 20 years ago, way out in Monroeville, El Campesino opened its doors as pretty much the areas first non-chain Mexican Restaurant. We had the Chi-Chi's and such, but pretty much no locally owned Mexican restaurants. Therefor, El Campesino really took off. They took off SO much, they decided to branch out...and pretty much became a local chain of the same with different names.

I do believe that El Paso is one of them. And El Campesino laid out a pretty good formulaic groundwork, bringing 'better than Taco Bell' to a wide variety of neighborhoods all over the local area.

And they are all decent. Decent in portion, flavor and price. El Paso is no different. In fact, they're all pretty much the same.

The food is not stellar...but it's good. It's consistent from site to site. I met up with a co-worker in Bridgeville, and she ordered the queso con chorizo, which she described as 'Crack on a plate'. It is a very nice dipping sauce for the tortilla chips that come to the table...creamy white cheese with chorizo sausage hidden underneath. Quite yummy. 

I'm not sure which 'number' I ordered, but it involved a taco, a chile relleno (ray-YAY-no), and refried beans. Didn't blow my mind, but satisfied my craving. The chile was battered and stuffed with the usual white cheese, and the taco was a chicken taco (which I tried because my co-worker said the chicken was really good) and it was pretty much just a chicken taco. The refried beans were refried beans. Good at El Campesino, Good here. No difference. The formula works...don't change it.

The service was efficient and pleasant, albeit a bit mechanical, and the eye candy (non-patron) was short and sweet. Our server was very attentive and helpful (we actually knocked over a soda, and he was right there to help clean up) but he was just kind of an waitron. He didn't really 'engage'...just took the order and watched over us. EFFICIENT...but not engaging.

The atmosphere was as typical as all of the others...pleasant, unoffensive and unpretentious.

With all of the 'Campesino' clones around the area, I would go back to this one...IF I were in the area...which I very, very, very rarely am. BUT, for anyone who IS in the area, I recommend it. The prices are extremely reasonable, the food quality is good, and the atmosphere is comfortable and pleasant."}
{"text":"This place was really nice. Cute outdoor area and really nice staff. The food overall was good, I had steak and chorizo tacos and my husband had the cheese enchiladas. A little more pricey for some items than at similar restaurants. Not sure if we would make a special trip, but if we were in the area and wanted some Mexican food I would definitely stop in."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favorite Mexican places in town. This restaurant is super friendly and super fast. It also has an elegant feel. We will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Stopped on a whim! We weren't disappointed at all. Good prices, great food and super fast service. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"El Paso used to be my favorite local Mexican place.  When they first opened, and for the few years following, the guacamole was fresh, the food was consistently good and you always knew what you were getting, and the people who worked there were attentive and nice.  I went a couple months ago and was astonished with its decline.  I decided to go the other day to give it another try, and was even more disappointed.  Everything tastes like it came out of a can.  The guacamole definitely came out of a bag, the salsa was \"meh\" at best, and the quesadilla was no longer spectacular.  I used to go there just to get a quesadilla, so to get what I got this time in comparison was just sad.  And to top it all off, the guy who waited on us has been there the longest of all of them, and seemed so thrilled (sarcasm font) to still be working there.  He threw our drinks on the table AS he was walking away, was mostly silent when taking our order, threw our food on the table AS he was walking away again, didn't ask how anything was, and just gave us our check.  It's sad because it used to be so good; the new murals on the walls aren't even finished, but alas, I will not be back to see the finished product.  If Taco Bell is better than you, you're doing something wrong."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I'm from CA and wasn't expecting much from PA in the way of Mexican food! 
Clean friendly place hidden in a corner of a strip mall... Let's start with the salsa, wasn't even close to the best I've had, wasn't terrible either. More like tomato sauce though. The meals were again not awful but far from what I'm accustomed to in CA. I was pleasantly surprised! Price was average I'd guess, and I would come again. If they could at-least get the salsa a bit closer to the average in CA I'd give it a 4*"}
