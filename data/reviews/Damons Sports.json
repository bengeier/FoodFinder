{"text":"This was my first visit this location since most others have closed...
If you going there for the food...ONE STAR
Waitresses...It's the best thing there...FOUR STARS
I've been going to Damons for many years...this is the worst location I've been too...
What's changed...
     The ribs weren't fresh tasting.  They made me feel sick after eating them. 
     The onion loaf they now sell is awful
      APPEARS TO BE PROFIT BEFORE QUALITY FOOD
SORRY DAMONS BUT I WON'T BE BACK"}
{"text":"4 of us went in on a Friday night (8:30) just for drinks on our way to another destination. There were approximately 4 tables seated and one person at the bar, so they were dead. We ordered and one drink was vodka lemonade, the bartender came back to tell us that they are out of lemonade and he's not making any more (with an attitude) so she changed her order. When I was ready for a refill I pushed my empty glass to the front of the bar which usually is the hint that I'm ready for another and after 5 minutes he paid no attention to the 5 people at the bar so I asked the bartender \"I'll have a another when you get a chance, thanks\" and he responded \"it will be few minutes\".  Hey bartender, if you don't like working with the public go to the backend of the house!"}
{"text":"Food arrived lukewarm.  They did heat it up after being asked. Manager came by later and asked about meal. Said she would go speak the cook, but no apologies to us. This place appears to be run by people that are totally inexperienced in the restaurant business and customer service. Too bad. I used to like the Damon's in Middleburg Hts."}
{"text":"Disappointing food, awful service.  Place was empty at 7pm on a Monday.  Outback, next door, in contrast had a 45 min wait.  Now I know why.  

I sat down and was given my drink within eight minutes, it took another fifteen for the bar back that was on break to ask if I had ordered yet.  He took my order because apparently the bartender/server was the only other person working the front. 

Ordered a 14.99 sirloin medium that was grey but somehow undercooked with a dusting of saut√©ed (read: dry) mushrooms for an extra 1.99 and a baked potato. I sent half of the steak back because it was inedible, the soup was cold.  I basically paid 20$ for a baked potato and some soup. 

Had to ask for my check twice.. 

I know why the place was empty. Awful, awful, awful.  You're better off getting chipotle and a redbox movie than coming here. 

One star because I literally can't give it any less."}
{"text":"I have memories in college of heading to the local Damon's, watching the NCAA tournament first round on a 16-screen video wall and playing trivia while trying to shout out the wrong answers to surrounding patrons.  This is not that Damon's.  The interior really doesn't match what you would think of as a sports bar, more just like another iteration of the 25048 Sperry Road address (a line that, in recent history, goes from Frank & Pauly's to Manero's to Taverne of Westlake) with a couple more televisions placed here and there.

The food didn't make up for the disappointing surroundings.  The signature Steamboat sandwich--a hoagie with BBQ pulled pork and melted cheese--from my first visit is a pretty messy eat, a little on the bland side, but will really stick to your ribs.    Surprisingly, the ribs were not listed as a \"signature item,\" so I went with the prime rib on a second visit.  This was a major letdown--the meat came out dull gray with a soggy and spongy texture.  You would do much better for yourself getting the prime rib at the Outback down the street.

I think if a business is going to succeed at that location, they would have to fight an uphill battle against the established and popular Outback and Carrabba's and further distinguish themselves from Hooley House (which I haven't been to, but if it's along the lines of the previous tenant, The Boneyard, more accurately fits what a sports bar should look like).  This means beating those guys at their own game or going in a completely different direction, like possibly pizza or seafood (filling a gap left by the Sperry Road departure of Joe's Crab Shack)."}
{"text":"The place is padlocked shut. Don't bother arriving but from the reviews, it was bound to happen sooner than later. Closed."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here today. Our waitress was very personable and took very good care of us. The buffalo chicken dip was just like I make it at home. The french fries were hot and very good. Cole slaw was tasty and the baby back ribs were very good. Little disappointed in the buffalo chicken mac & cheese. It would have been better if it were hot and used the same cheese as the buffalo chicken dip. We will go back."}
{"text":"They are closed. Called the number and is disconnected. Same owner as the old place of taverns of westlake. Never go to a place that pat Elliot owns. He has no idea on running a place or pays his staff. Worst owner in the world."}
{"text":"Service was sub-par and it really wasn't that busy on a Friday night during what is normally the \"dinner rush hours\". My wife and I ordered the ribs which were good but still underwhelming. The signature French onion soup (which I was charged 2 up charges when only one of us got the soup.) was not much of a \"signature\" and more like scribble print with crayon. The only reason I gave this place 2 stars is because the onion straw appetizer was the best part of the dinner. Plus I felt bad that I overheard that 2 hostess didn't show up to work that night. So it was really a sympathy star because I've seen 3-4 business go into that building. And I've only lived here for about 5 years!"}
