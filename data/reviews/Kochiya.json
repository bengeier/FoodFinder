{"text":"Amazing food!  A great collection of kebabs from seafood to meat lovers that make great appetizers with a cold pitcher of beer.  I also had the baked chicken that was marinated with a light curry.  Delicious!  Most of all the service and ambience is wonderful.  Highly recommended for those who want to have quality food in a place that is warm and inviting but want to watch the pocket book.  Pretty new place so hopefully the quality and service stays the same."}
{"text":"My 1st visit would be the last one...

I and my wife came here with high expectation as one of my close friends strongly recommend this place.
This casual diner & pub used to be quite common in 90s and its interior reminded me of my 20s back then.

We ordered 'cheese don katsu' and 'regular don katsu'. After 5 minutes, waitress came back to me and only one piece of don katsu is available...
Quite surprise, but it can happen, right?
We changed order, substituting one with Hamburger steak.
As its lunch price was reasonable and cheap ($5-7) until 6 pm, we hope food doesn't disappoint us.

After short wait, food was served and meh...
quite below expectation.
Rice was dried up since it was prepared before and heated afterwards.
Cheese donkatsu was nothing special and my wife can make way better one.
Hamburger steak was, again, tastes like retort food (a.k.a Ottogi 3 minute series) and heated precooked ones. Surface was overcooked as well.

Sorry, the price is cheap, but bargain doesn't justify below standard food."}
{"text":"It was our first time at Kochiya since we often dine at another resto in the same plaza. Food at Kochiya is sumptuous and priced right ! 

Chicken cutlet, Roe rice and bulgogi were amazingly delicious. Try their whole chicken as well as a takeout. 

Plaza is between BMW showroom and Tim Hortons. :)


FYI - business establishment has closed."}
