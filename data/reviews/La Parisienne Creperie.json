{"text":"Great crepes and service. Quaint spot. The French onion soup was delicious. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Good food but nothing outstanding, so the prices are way too much for just \"a la French\" interior. The service is quite friendly, but you can tell the difference when the owner talks to locals or strangers. We had a lunch there and decided that unlikely we return."}
{"text":"Lovely little chic French Creperie in Bronte oakville near the port. We were welcomed by the friendly manager who seated us near the window. We ordered the famous onion soup which came to the table hot ands full of herbs! The soup was one of the best tasting french onion soups I've had. For dessert we ordered the banana chocolate crepe Royale. The crepe itself was absolutely delicious. Well definitely be back to try the savory crepes! There is a vast menu of flavors for both sweet and savory crepes!"}
{"text":"This quaint little French restaurant in Oakville, operated by its two charming owners, Marie-France and her husband, Pierre, first opened its doors in 1991. Along with their signature crepes, they offer a variety of lunch and dinner selections. My favorite is the French onion soup. It is not only the best I've have had in Toronto, it's the best I've had anywhere and that includes France! This place is the real deal. A touch of Paris in Oakville, Ontario."}
{"text":"My favourite creperie by far! This is a small, lovely, and beautifully decorated restaurant. Everything here is phenomenal. We had the La Classique and Florentine crepes, both were perfect. The French onion soup is the best I've had outside of France (I'm sure they have a secret recipe). The creme brûlée was fresh and perfectly torched. Bonus: Although the place is small, the staff did their best to accommodate our stroller which was very kind of them. Would definitely come back again!!"}
{"text":"I went here with one of my friends to catch up, and it's the cutest little French place! The cafe itself made me feel like I was in a different place, and the crepe and tea that we had were both pretty decent- not amazing but still worth a visit. Recommend!"}
{"text":"It's a very cute creperie. I had a French press and a crepe Suzette in the afternoon. Love the crepe. I'll come back for other flavours."}
{"text":"Lovely little french bistro in the heart of Bronte. The french onion soup was delicious! Husband had the beef bourguignon crepe (very filling) and I had the odeon crepe (perfect lighter fare). Our friend had the Latin baked crepe (very rich but very good). Very impressed with the service and food. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Over priced and the crepe batter has a funny taste. The decor is needed an update."}
{"text":"this place is amazing. But make sure you make a reservation. It's very intimate, only about 10 tables. 

I got the soup and crepe of the day for 17$. Celery root soup & a spinach bacon, avocado crepe! 

I loved everything, the food atmosphere & service! 

Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I love, love, love this restaurant. It is absolutely adorable. The decor is sweet. The restaurant is very close to the lake in Bronte and has big windows with lots of natural light. 

I would strongly recommend making reservations as the restaurant is very tiny. My friend and I went here on a whim, arrived as soon as it opened. After 15min the place was completely full with people waiting. 

I had a crepe with bacon, apple and cheddar. It was phenomenal. It was so big I had a hard time finishing it. 10/10 would order again. 

The coffee was the best. It is a French press brought to your table. I couldn't get enough.

The little almond cookies are delicious. They paired great with the coffee and were the perfect ending to brunch. 

The service was excellent as well. There were two people that took turns serving us. Obviously the communicate well because neither one of them missed a beat when it came to bringing food or asking how we were doing. 

I was very impressed with this restaurant. Looking forward to dining there again."}
{"text":"We went to this little creperie on a sunday morning a few months ago and truly enjoyed our experience. The location itself was very quaint and was by the lake which made it relaxing. Although it was a tighter space, we were able to fit 8 adults and 2 baby's near the back - they were super accommodating. My husband had a sweet crepe while I had a savory crepe - we really enjoyed it! We also ordered a fresh croissant to share but the price being $5 was a little bit of a turn off. The only other small turn off was our waitress, I felt like she was rushing us and kept interrupting us. None the less, we did enjoy ourselves and I would highly recommend this spot for a cute little brunch :)"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for over 15 years as a family, and can't say enough good things about this place.  The son and daughter-in-law recently took over the reigns from his father and mother, and they've remained true to the art.  The crepes are warm, delicious and pilled high with fresh and creative fillings, especially the dessert crepes!  Between the intimate vibe and friendly welcome, we'll be come back for many years to come."}
{"text":"Best crepes hands down!!! The place itself is a little small. We were seated by the window and I felt a little cramped but the place is super cute. The savoury crepes were amazing. The desert one we got was just with hazelnut spread and whipped cream. It was just okay. Loved the coffee! Came in a little French press."}
{"text":"The crepes were quite amazing with many different flavors to choose. It looked simple but the taste weren't simple as they look, and the simplest food were the hardest to make. The décor was pretty romantic IMO, and it was near the lake so you can have a nice walk in the summer time."}
{"text":"Great little gem in the heart of downtown bronte.  They specialize I. The most delicious crepes.  The French onion soup should not be missed, rich and full of flavours. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"If you come here only get the dessert crepes - they are amazing.  The dinner crepes, I had the baked chicken bacon, was a too rich, sloppy mess.  Just tastes like pepper and cream. Also too expensive for the quality."}
{"text":"Went here for valentine's day for the first time under new management and the difference in decor/atmosphere is night and day!  The food was absolutely delicious and worth the wait. I had the \"Lorraine\" and my wife had the \"Picardie\". Both were equally flavourful in there own way.  The restaurant is known for their french onion soup and it lived up to its reputation.   Service was super friendly, the cook even came out to say hi to the customers when she had time to do so.  Highly recommended if you are in the area and looking for quality crepes and nice quiet, comfy ambience.   Keep up the good work!!

{"text":"Straight out of Paris. This is the only place is Oakville that you should be eating crepes.
It is not pretentious but it has a very elegant Art Deco French feel. The food is always perfect. You have to have the Nutella crepe with bananas."}
