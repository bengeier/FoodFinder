{"text":"This is really a hole in the wall type of joint. Stopped here because Why Not!? Long story short when tou 1st walk in theres alot of going on... Not people wise but businesses. El Kiosko is not only a restaurant but some kind of auto transport business - when we walkes in the lady greated us and took our order. She was the cashier and the cook! 2 other ladies walk in and sit at one of the tables - one of the ladies walks up to the counter a bit upset no one has tended to her. The cashier says im sorry im the cook as well as the cashier and waitress Lol  Well we placed an order (To go) for (3) Carne Asada Gorditas - an approximate wait of 10 minutes.   We got home and the Gordita was ok... edible but not finger licking good - the Gordita wasnt Huge (i think 2 gorditas per person would be reasonable) each Gordita was $3.00   Would I stop here again... i dont know Would I recommend this to my people? Hmm probably Not (only because I havent really tried anything else)"}
{"text":"The barbacoa here is amazingly delicious! One of the best barbacoas that I've ever tasted. The service here is great as well. They have a room where you can order and eat. The servers are fast and really nice. I would definitely recommend giving this place a shot!"}
{"text":"I'm not really rating the food as I didn't really eat anything here but Nachos.  However I received fantastic service from the son of the owner from this store. I had dropped my bike off next door at the motorcycle shop to be fixed and was waiting for a ride. Unfortunately rain was coming down hard and my ride home was still hours away. I was sitting outside the store well after they had closed, when one of the employees walked outside.  At first he gave me the wifi password so I'd have something to do, he clearly felt bad that I was stranded by my ride home.   Then he turned around and decided to offer me a ride home rather than leave me sitting outside.   Due to me being nervous about the area I was stranded in, I couldn't thank him enough.  This review is late, but I wanted to make sure I put it up. I couldn't speak higher of the service I received here."}
