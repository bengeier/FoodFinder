{"text":"Stopped by last week for a few drinks and absolutely loved my waitress, Susan! She gave awesome service and she is absolutely hilarious. Her great vibes will bring me back for more!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were in the mood for burgers, but we also wanted to watch football on a Sunday afternoon after flying into the Mesa-Gateway Airport. Beast of Bourbon checked all of our boxes with huge HD tv's throughout the bar and restaurant showing all of the NFL games. The manager had no problem tuning the tv nearest to us to the game we wanted to watch. Our burgers were cooked to order and tasted delicious."}
{"text":"Great mellow atmosphere. Live music. No hesitation on getting a drink, bartender was on top of it. Good conversation, nice people. Always like going to a place where you feel at home. I also hear they have a great burger deal going on right now. Check this place out..."}
{"text":"So glad we decided to stop by for dinner tonight! The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive; they even paid extra attention to my daughter which she loved :) The atmosphere was welcoming and everything was incredibly clean.    We tried the nachos to start and they did NOT disappoint! I'm not typically a fan of pork but their shredded pork changed my mind.  It was flavorful,  juicy and delicious! I even added it to my grilled cheese. My husband took a huge leap of faith when he tried the PB & J bacon burger and it was worth it! The burger was unique, well cooked and paired well with their homemade fries and ranch.   We can't wait to come back without the tiny human to enjoy some drinks and karaoke or beat my husband at trivia night!"}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow and the food wasn't really worth waiting for.  Just don't have their act together."}
{"text":"Cool, remodeled venue for bourbon and live music fans.  This place has a convenient layout with lots of comfy booths for dining or drinking.  The Boomer band was playing when we were there and the music was fun and classic.  Our waitress was friendly and the selection of bourbon sported some unexpected labels.  Minus 1 star for being out of our first selection of bourbon and brighter than necessary lighting.  Check this place out for live music on the East Side!"}
{"text":"Please do not skip on the food. I'm a huge fan of their beer selection but the bacon wrapped meatballs were absolutely incredible. I did not expect this kind of bar faire, which is what made it such a great surprise. Be sure to stop by when the bands are playing, they cover all of my favorite classic rock tunes perfectly."}
{"text":"Seems fun. Nice interior, great drink prices, and live bands. Only question is, where are the customers? This place had 6 people in it on a Thursday night."}
{"text":"Just walked in now to no servers or person at the bar. Sign says seat yourself after 10 minutes of no one but a few customers we left. I think it's crazy we are new to town and wanted to try the restaurant but there was no staff??"}
{"text":"It's one mile from my house so I frequent the restaurant.  TVs are great.   Big and many of them! Food is great.  Ribs and all the burgers are great.  Drinks are best if served by Aimee.  Aimee is great.  Funny, attentive, and personable.  Servers hustle to get the orders out.  Highly recommend the Beast."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here with a friend, I had the black bean burger and it was massive and delicious, though very messy.  My friend had the blue cheese burger and devoured it.  The fries were hot and crispy.  It was a slow night and our food came out at a decent time.  Waitress was very nice!"}
{"text":"We're out of towers from California who do not like to eat chains so I made the effort to find a place in your area to patronize. To my disappointment we arrive to this  place (nice set up, good menu, this place seemed so promising) to find NO ONE at the front... no big deal we can wait. Upon waiting we notice that there's only one 3 top eating, that should have been a clear tell - 1 table occupied on prime lunch time (got there at noon) on a Saturday? After about five minutes, someone comes out, she was friendly at first (note: AT FIRST) I tell her \"we're leaving, we've been here for five minutes to no avail\" to which she throws her hands in the air and exclaims \"WELL IM THE ONLY ONE HERE!!!\"  Wonderful, all the better, we're out.   I don't even write reviews anymore but this is just  too damn bad, money must not be the goal at this operation."}
{"text":"Awesome drinks. I'm a Texas guy and the fact that they have Deep Eddy is a huge plus.    They have a great selection of whiskey and the beast of bourbon burger is phenomenal AND huge!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. My new go to restaurant for some good comfort food. This place is near the house and I used to occasionally stop in. But not anymore. The new owners put in a new menu and the food is amazing. I used to be in the restaurant business. And you can tell everything about a place by just looking at the menu. This menu is made by someone that loves food. The Fig and Brie burger (melted Brie, fig jam, bacon, tomato, arugula and mayo) is amazing plus the Thai Red Curry wings are out of this world. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to watch the NFC Championship game and a friend said to give this a try. I walked in at least five minutes ahead of my wife and waited near the unattended hostess station watching the last of the Patriots/Jaguars game. As others have mentioned, I had nobody ask if I'd like to be seated... if we didn't already know about the good food and the bourbon selection, we could've easily walked out. They need to fix this, as it will kill them.  Having said that... once we were seated and ordered our drinks and food, well, couldn't be happier. Wife had the spicy shrimp and toast plate, while I had the pork nachos. Both were terrific. Bourbon shots with spherical ice made at the table was a nice touch... easy sipping, without getting watered down. Beer selection is not huge, but serviceable I think. Finished out the evening with the bread pudding, which was good too.  Hope they tweak the service, as they have a good thing..."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great service! Definitely will be regulars here from now on! Dara was awesome!"}
{"text":"Try it    The sandwiches are good.  The fries need work.    Taste like they are kept in a warmer"}
{"text":"Still up in the air.... just moved very close to this place so I'm gonna give it another shot. Took a long time to get served but once our server realized no one had helped us she was great. Food was so so. Beer was nice and ice cold. Live music was great."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try. It's right around the corner of my house. Went in to eat and watch some football with my husband and two of our kids. There was a \"please wait to be seated\" sign. We sat there for a good 5-10 min. With the bartender talking to one of the patrons. Not one acknowledgment, or a \"be right with you\" . Big disappointment. My family really likes to support local businesses."}
{"text":"Great casual atmosphere!  Server was spot on and made our visit very enjoyable.  Pulled pork nachos were delicious!  We'll definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"The night we went they had live music, which I did enjoy. Country bar, country music. Service was okay- it wasn't very packed and we went on a Saturday night which should have been a good indication that it wasn't going to be spectacular. We had to wait quite a bit for drinks and then food (which goes back to, if it wasn't crowded, why wait??) I got the meatball hoagie- wasn't like grandma's but wasn't horrible. I wouldn't have again though. My boyfriend had a burger which he said was all too greasy for his liking. Overall it was ok, but wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Hands down best wings in 20 mile radius.  Super laid back staff, good music, and healthy pours.  Glad its here."}
{"text":"Our waitress was kind. Chips and salsa were meh. Burgers were huge and filling. Went on a Sunday afternoon was kinda dead.... only few regulars."}
{"text":"Walked in around 4 on a Friday afternoon, we sat at a table just off the bar and walked out after 5 min or so. Don't even think they realized we walked in. However everyone at the bar noticed we walked in!!! Service was non existent at best. Not a good way for a new business to start out. Oh well, the location they are at has been about 5 different things over the past several years, so they will just be added to the list. SMDH!!!"}
{"text":"Best spot in town! Live music every fri and sat! Great owners and staff. Good clean environment!"}
{"text":"First time here. Food was excellent. Had the pork sliders and chicken quessadilla. Service was good. Beer could have been a little colder but overall good experience."}
{"text":"We have been here before but wanted to check it out since we heard it was under new ownership with a new menu. We were not disappointed at all. We were greeted right away when we walked in and were told we could sit anywhere we wanted.  As soon as we sat down our server asked us what we would like to drink. The drinks came out within minutes. The food was very good. I had the house burger and my wife had a salad. Our server checked in on us alot to see if we needed anything. And to top it off the band was amazing. We will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now. The southwest bacon burger and pork nachos were amazing.  The wings were good too.  Quick service and friendly bartenders. Stella and Ken were great."}
{"text":"Liked the ambiance Service was good Beer was warm Burgers were undercooked Bacon on one burger really undercooked French fries were good Potentially a good place, execution is not there Two burgers with fries and three beers $31 also good Doubt we will go back"}
{"text":"There is nothing I hate more than writing a bad review, especially a local restaurant. I would much  rather discuss any issues with management than blast an establishment on yelp. This place used to be great, however we really had a bad night (along with others apparently) and the manager chose not talk to us after I had asked. We went on Tuesday early for happy hour. There were a handful of people there, yet we waited 45 minutes for wings and another 30 min or so for our meals. The wings were great as usual, but my fries were cold and the bacon on my burger was nearly raw and cold. My husband's club was missing the avocado. We asked for the check as we were now running late for our movie. The waitress informed us we would need to pay cash as their computers were down and they did not have an atm. We told her we were going to miss our movie and asked to speak to the manager, as I did not feel comfortable writing down our card number. Manager did not come over, but she said we could come back after the movie to pay. We wrote down our info just for some good faith (we didn't want her to get in trouble because it wasn't her fault). We did come back and pay, but still no manager to be found. I hate to say that this restaurant may be on its way out. I hope they can pull it together because we really like having a good place down the street!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise this place is! Great food, very clean, excellent service and the band: Brownedog Blues Band was excellent! Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Best wings in town!! I know thats a bold statement but I was blown away by the De la Seol wings. That sauce was perfection. Just delicious with a touch of spice. Since, I also noticed they had a new menu, I also ordered the Cemita. Breaded pork tenderloin, ham, avocado, chipotle chutney, arugula and Oaxacan cheese. Wow, simply amazing. I'm definitely going back cause this new menu looks incredible and I want to try everything. Great job."}
{"text":"My husband and I intended to go to Buffalo Wild Wings when we drove by Beast of Bourbon and decided to go it it a try.  Friday, December 2, 2017 My husband and I had to change our beverage order three different times because they didn't have the beer that was listed on the menu; Corona Light, Coors Light and Grand Canyon Pilsner.  We were ready to leave but the under aged waitress serving alcohol apologized saying \"I don't know what the deal is.\"  The blackened fish sandwich and the Carolina Barbecue wings were tasty, making up for the poor service and lack of beverage availability.  We will probably try some other establishments before re-visiting."}
{"text":"Big place!  Food was ok.  You get a lot!  We waited a long time for our drinks and appetizer.  We were offered no water, and water at your table should be an automatic in arizona.  Not memorable."}
{"text":"Came here with the wife and kids a couple months ago, terribly disappointed. BUT came back today, new owner Ron and bartenders Bonita and Tyler made us feel so comfortable and welcome! Great food and drinks, awesome prices! Thank goodness for our neighborhood new bar! Come in and see, won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I tried this place because of the awesome name and it was by far the best Old Fashioned I had on my whole trip. (I've been on an Old Fashioned kick). Came here to do some homework for a course I was taking. I only ate the Mozerella sticks but they were good. Nice atmosphere and whiskey / beer selection. Waitresses were attentive and nice."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, decor is appealing. Nice pours on the drinks- good prices. They have live music Friday & Saturday nights. Also regular & reverse happy hour. We will absolutely go back!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Barbeque....fun atmosphere and live music and Karaoke throughout the week!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place now that there is new management and new menu. Atmosphere is the same. Saw new employees and menu had some new items. I got the Hawaiian burger. I love teriyaki and pineapple, so win win. Nope!! Teriyaki sauce was like water. So thin and hardy any taste. The burger had two thin pieces of meat (I'm positive it's the frozen patty kind) with absolutely no taste. The slice of ham was thin you could barely see it.  That's not a burger! The tots were good though. Hubby got the grilled teriyaki chicken breast with pineapple and jalapeño salsa, cilantro lime rice and street corn. He loves teriyaki too. And rice and corn is his favorite. When we got our food his plate had mashed potatoes and asparagus. He asked if this was his order, she said yes. Ummm where's the rice and corn?! Oh we are out.  Ok no one told us and this isn't what I ordered!!  Oh yeah sorry about that. To not make a big deal about it ate it. She did bring out a bowl of white rice. His chicken had no teriyaki on it. Or if it did you could not see it or taste it. Didn't eat the mashed potatoes and didn't eat the asparagus. Two tasteless meals. Oh and the wings we had for appetizers, were eeehhhhh ok. Nothing to brag about. Don't think we will be back.  Very disappointed!"}
