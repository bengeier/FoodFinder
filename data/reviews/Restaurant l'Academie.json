{"text":"Disappointing is the best way I can describe it. Nice looking resto. But decor is filthy, seats are stained and look very dirty. Fruit flies were all over the place.  Food was subpar at best. No mussels available. Seafood pasta was tasteless with about an inch of oil in the bottom of bowl. Service was weak. Staff seemed rushed and would basically just dump your plate down, no service etiquette at all. 
Highlight was it was bring your own wine. Would not eat here again."}
{"text":"We originally wanted to attend their brunch, but it was only available on Sundays at their Brossard location so we decided to go for late lunch on Saturday at one of their downtown locations (Crescent avenue) instead.

We had heard that the mussels and fries were recommended and worth trying, so we wanted to order those; however, I'm not sure why but the mussels & fries weren't available when we visited L'Academie. Perhaps they ran out of them after lunch hours? Were they saving it for dinner? We're not sure, but our waitress told us that everything with mussels in it weren't available to order.

 We ordered:
Hubby - Garlic Snails ($7), Linguini con Gamberi ($10.95 at lunch)
Me - Chef's Special: Curry Seafood Paella, small salad ($21)

Even before we finished our order, we were given complimentary bread and butter to munch on. The restaurant was greatly well lit, warm, and cozy. They had a mixture of comfy booths and tables; we were seated at a booth since there were no other customers. I loved the restaurant's ambiance and atmosphere which made my expectations increase.

Our appetizers arrived promptly, and as both of us were famished from all the walking we did that afternoon, we dove right in. The salad was fresh and I quite liked the dressing that they used; it tasted like French dressing, but I  wasn't 100% sure. As for the escargot, hubby loved how there was generous heaps of cheese and garlic sauce on each escargot, and at its price, it roughly estimated to $1/snail. However, the cheese wasn't superb quality and it was also overly cooked, so much that some of the cheese was hardening.

Our main dishes came out not too long after our appetizers, and I was surprised at how large the dish was. On another note, I was disappointed at how old my dish was (you can clearly see all the marks!) that held my paella. The marks were mostly scratches and dents that proved that the dish was used countless number of times. I wished that it had been cleaner, because it definitely affected the visual presentation of the dish. Aside from the presentation, the paella, to me, tasted just okay. Maybe I had too high of expectations? Hubby said my dish tasted better than his (I'll get to that soon), but still, mine wasn't anything extraordinary or special. There was no WOW factor, and all I could taste was the curry: no seafood taste (overcooked?). I'm not sure how often the paella is served as the Chef's special, but I wouldn't really recommend it too much. I'd definitely recommend it over their pastas, but I'd probably opt for the mussels and fries instead.

As for the pasta, in one sentence, this pasta is worth your $10.95, but not $18.00. Hubby and I are no professional cooks by any means, but we realized we could've cooked better, and more flavourful, pasta than the one we had at L'Academie. There wasn't a lot of flavour in the pasta at all and it was pretty overcooked (was not al dente)! Since we were the only customers at the restaurant, there was essentially no way they could've messed up our order. So, does this mean that this is how they usually cook pasta? The pasta and the noodles weren't really coming together which made the pasta lack flavour and taste, and the shrimp and vegetables (spinach and tomato) were cooked alright, but everything in general lacked a lot of flavour. This pasta isn't something we would recommend.

At L'Academie, I think it will be a better idea to try their popular mussels & fries, or one of their more expensive Land or Sea menus rather than pasta."}
{"text":"We ate here twice. It's a great little French/Italian restaurant and the end of the bustling Rue Crescent. Prices are reasonable for the portion size. We only had pasta but it was great. Desserts were good too."}
{"text":"BYOW & Beer was amazing. They give you a ice jug for your alcohol too. Awesome food, big portions. A little expensive- but then again you aren't spending a bunch of money on booze. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"L'Academie has a really elegant interior but I found it to be lacking something. It's very modern looking, with some classical elegance and always very busy. The prices are surprisingly affordable for such a posh atmosphere, especially on Crescent street. 
The food is quite good, although we didn't realize it was BYOW and we definitely would've liked some wine with our meal (if you're not eating meat, the large part of the menu is pasta). I would say the food deserves only 3 stars.
The best part about L'Academie? The service is STELLAR, absolutely excellent, compared to my Montreal dining experiences. At other restaurants you get a snooty server that doesn't check up on you often, but that was absolutely not our experience at L'Academie. Two hosts came up to check on us, and several people offered us water, and our server was amazing. 
And if you are curious about the washrooms / restroom, I think they only have one in the lower level (there are 3 levels), but it is a really nice one (free floss, anyone?). This place is definitely great for dates, group dinners, but I wouldn't say I would bring someone from out of town here."}
{"text":"Crap. Food is meh, pricy and bla service. No ambiance, waiters look always stressed out. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"Went here on a cold snowy Montreal night with a group of six. The place was packed but we called ahead an grabbed a nice table next to the front window upstairs. 

I have never had such a hard time picking my meal, I could have ordered any of 20 things on the menu and been perfectly happy. I was jealous of all 5 of the other people in our groups meals, and mine was delicious. 

They have about 12 adaptations of mussels and frites, which were delicious. Its also BYOB which saved a ton of money as we brought 6 bottles of wine.

Although my appetite (and head) may have been a little skewed after the half dozen Molson Exports at the Canadiens game before dinner, I would surely recommend this place and will visit it again next time I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"Came up to Montreal for the weekend and found this place by accident. The waiter, Michael, was fantastic. Very attentive and good personality. The food was wonderful. Ordered the Vichyssoise soup, outstanding. Then had the mussels mariniere. Not all of the mussels had been debearded properly, but the broth was very good. Came back the next night, same soup and ordered the salmon tartare. Perfect 5 stars the second night. We were there on both a Friday and Saturday night. Did not have any of the problems with service or loud diners mentioned in other reviews. Next time I am in Montreal, I will definitely be coming back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  Restaurants have to but put into perspective - not every restaurant is suitable for every occasion.  I went on a Wednesday night with a friend, looking for a place that would have good food, a hip atmosphere and fair prices - l'Academie definitely fit the bill.  The calamari and pasta on special were delicious, I brought a good wine from the SAQ, service was excellent, the decor was hip, the restaurant was lively but not too loud, and price came to around $25 / person pre-tip.  Had a great night thanks to l'Academie - it's definitely going to be one of my top picks for a social night out."}
{"text":"The decor is fresh and modern, and the service is friendly and prompt, without being overbearing. It is worth checking out their lunch / Sun-Wed dinner special: choice of soup or salad, plus pasta or mussels for $12.95. There is a huge selection to choose from. Portion sizes are reasonable, and the food is good (but not outstanding) -- I found their mussels to be better than their pasta dishes. The best part is that this place is BYOW!"}
{"text":"The filet mignon poutine was amazing, and this is coming from someone who isn't the biggest poutine fan and wasn't that hungry. 

The rest of the food was good too, nice atmosphere and good service!"}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Yuk!  I've been there twice now in two years and the outcome is the same:  yuk!

Soup was like it was out of can - actually I had better soup from a can...

I had a seafood au gratin, served with a grilled pineapple on the side.  Vile!  The b√©chamel sauce was thick with an strange after taste.  My wife had a veal parmesan - there was 1/2 inch of cheese on a thin dried up piece of meat with grilled a pineapple slice on the side...  Sadly, I think the pineapple was the best part!

The service was so slow even if the place was almost empty (on a Friday lunch no less...).  When I got impatient I was told that they did not know I was in a rush.  I was not in a rush, I had just been sitting there for two hours!!

Never again"}
{"text":"I adore this bring your own wine restaurant. I like specially love that they have specials on pastas and muscles from Sundays to Wednesdays for about $12.95 plus tax. I highly recommend that is when you should go and try it out. I also love that they are usually strategically place in an area that has a liquor store nearby so you can shoot a nice one. Even if there is no liquor store nearby, this location on Crescent Street is close to several corner stores where you can choose your drinks. My favorite is the blue cheese mussels dish. It is absolutely divine. Make sure you get extra bread so you can dip it in the luxurious sauce."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN!

I ordered Cutlet Parmigiana: It was microwaved dry like a beef jerky with tomato sauce and nasty processed cheese on top. it tasted like a frozen HungryMan meal i even think the HungryMan FROZEN meal taste better. I only had two bits and i couldn't continue I told the waiter and he just told me that he can offer me a free coffee and desert lol i didn't even have a meal i REFUSED and i payed the full bill and left.

My wife ordered The Grilled Chicken Supeme
It was boiled not grilled (microwaved) and dumped in nasty sauce with no flavor 

Never going THERE again and i will never ever recommend it to anybody go buy a frozen dinner instead its cheaper and will taste better.

This is not Italian food."}
{"text":"I only go on Tuesdays to take advantage of their specials

 I recently went to L'Acadamie, a French-Italian restaurant that I have been to a few times now. When you walk in, their restaurant is inviting but at the same time vibrant. The d√©cor is classier than what you might expect given their menu price point when I consider other restaurants, and I have noticed that they often have larger groups of diners.  I have to say the way the food that we ordered was plated nicely with so many colors. The portion size of each dish is reasonable although it is easy to fill up on the free bread and with appetizers (coquille St-Jacques, Caesar salad and Italian sausage), neither of my dinner companions were able to finish their meals. 
I didn't enjoy the prosciutto stuffed chicken because the chicken was really, really dry.  The food was decent overall and arrived quickly to the table. The staff member who greeted us upon arrival didn't smile or say hello, and it is often tough to flag down waiters who are sometimes difficult to connect with once they have dropped off the food.  Lastly, after I finished my meal, I waited at least twenty minutes to pay our bill. Overall, what you would expect from a reasonably priced dining experience with an inviting d√©cor, good location and fair prices for a menu that will appeal to most.  Without the specials, I wouldn't consider the meals to be as good value."}
{"text":"L'academie restaurant is too noisy for me to converse at all with the person sitting next to me.food is so so nothing special.price is expensive."}
{"text":"So the food was alright and the ambiance was nice, but it was not worth over paying for!  Somehow our server mixed up our bill with another table.  They gave us and the wrong one.  Admittedly we were with friends and all fighting to pay the bill... we were in a hurry and paid the bill and didn't check the details - but did think it was more than it should have been. After we left, we checked the bill and found it was not consistent with what we all ordered. We contacted the restaurant the next day and told them and asked if we cross check and could adjust any errors to the correct amount. We were told \"too bad, you already paid\".  This is not exactly what we consider to be upstanding customer service.  Why would they not just adjust address the inquiry and correct bill if it was really wrong?  At least work with us to cross check the items we had so we could be sure if it was correct or not?  We were not trying to get out of paying, we just wanted to ensure we paid the correct bill.  I don't believe this place cares about integrity or repeat customers."}
{"text":"Excellent Mussels and the BYOB, Sun-Wed special of $12 for pasta/mussles and soup or salad is unbeatable. Although my g/f was unimpressed with the pasta the mussels I had were delicious and a sizable portion considering the special. Will go back again when in the area. Dessert was very nice with Creme Brulee."}
{"text":"Another great downtown Montreal restaurant. It's a little more on the pricier side, but well worth it. All I had was spaghetti and tomato sauce and fine herbs, which was so good. - Their tomato sauce tasted different than most other ones I've had at other restaurants. 
For dessert my friend and I split a cheesecake with strawberry coulis, and that was very delicious, as well. I rarely ever like to spend that much on cheesecake, but I think I'd make an exception for this place.
Service was just okay. I guess because it's so busy in there that they kind of unintentionally neglect some of the tables or they take forever to come by. The food sure came fast, but otherwise, the servers rarely came by unless we called them over."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonably priced, super kid-friendly, plus great people watching spot. We had the mussels and fries and wound up splitting a regular entree for kids. Host was fantastic...server was not the friendliest or responsive."}
{"text":"Just to clarify something for our American guests who come to visit. As another review states that this restaurant is a better version of the cheesecake factory clearly has zero knowledge about food whatsoever. I drive 4 hours to get to the closest cheesecake factory form Montreal but you couldn't pay me to eat at l'academie. I have been cooking for 10 years and work with my brother who is an executive chef with over 25 years experience and this place should be illegal for how bad everything was. Most other reviews speak for themselves. If I can give negative stars I would. Big rip off 

Just left this resto and will never go back. The decor is nice but the food is terrible. Everything is pre made and nothing is done on the spot. The service was ok but I couldn't blame the waiter as he had a big section all to himself. I work in the kitchen and on the floor so take my word for it, if your looking for good Italian food and a Byob check out La Strada in Lachine where I work and is owned by my family or Vivaldi in the west island. Don't waste time at this place. I do not recommend it."}
{"text":"The food was decent. Some dishes were better than others. However, the waiter (Danny) was bloody HORRIBLE. He was pretentious and felt entitled. He served us but barely checked up on us. At the end when we were getting our bill, before we even received our actual bill we received a lecture from him about tips and how much would be appropriate for him and HIS OWN suggested amount. The fact that he did that was just mind blowing. He gave us some bullshit that he had to pay out of pocket for his group tip if he didn't meet a certain amount. I'm sorry I thought tipping was a gesture and not mandatory. Anyways we gave him $25 and he flipped shit when he saw it and started cussing. It was just a very unprofessional and hostile environment. I would avoid this particular waiter. 

Back to the food. Our table ordered various dishes. Most were very delicious and the others were decent. The price isn't too bad but for a chain it could've been less expensive. I would come back again for the food but definitely would avoid this place is Danny the waiter is there. Also the hostess we encounter was a bit pretentious also.

Main takeaway: Food is good and can be delicious. The staff was borderline anger management material and perhaps bi-polar.  Be careful with such people."}
{"text":"Prix tres eleves pour une qualite douteuse."}
{"text":"Why do lots of restaurant lose their edge as time passes by.
I hope the experience at this place does not reflect the rest of the chain of l'academie.
I will start by saying that the service was good.
However the food was of subpar it was delivered as quick as it was ordered, just like fast .
Everything had a heavy sauce and high in salt, perhaps to mask the taste. Dessert was also bad, not sure how you could swing that but they did.
The reason for two stars is the BYOW and  ok service."}
{"text":"Awesome BYOW spot out in Franada! BYOW= a staple, Bring your own wine (or beer), normally Italian/French restaurant that the French Canadians seem to love. And for good reason too..who doesn't like saving a dime on some alcohol?? 

I believe this is somewhat of a chain in the area, but we love it. The service was awesome, our waiter Benoit was so friendly, and our outdoor seating was supreme in the lovely weather. I had an arugula salad and smoked salmon appetizer, and both were delicious. This was a perfect light and refreshing combination. 

My coworker got a cheesy pasta veal dish, which was so scrumptious and hearty. We all took our fair share of bites- if not more- out of this tasty dish. For dessert, the selections were awesome. We finally chose the chocolate pie and apple pie. Both were so rich and a perfectly delicious way to end this lovely meal. I knew we were the last ones to leave at the end of this wine Wednesday night..we enjoyed the place too much and maybe had a little too much wine too!"}
{"text":"Excellent!  Perfect food, location and menu. BYO wine. Try fish specials, reals, and pasta. Arugula salad excellent."}
{"text":"Not often can one experience good food but yet feel so angry about just about everything else.  After a long day biking, I just wanted a happy meal to end the day with my friends and this place just found a way to make me give up my 1st big fat 1 star to a business.  L'Academie, you deserved this 1 big star and here's why.

Your place is modern and chic and centrally located.  With 2 floors, you can definitely satisfy  groups of all sizes.  But do yourself a favor, hire more waiters and not just that, hire waiters that actually give a damn.  My table waited over 30 minutes just to get an order, and not once did the waiter say he'll be right with us.  When he did come, he rudely rushed to take the order without even asking what we wanted to drink.  By the time one of us said I want to drink...he zipped away.  Then when we asked for more water, 3 separate times during the night, they just rudely said we'll be with you, but never did service us.

I really never make a big fuss over food and this place's food was good, but I will not detail what my party had that night.  I just can't contemplate promoting business for a place that was an outright scam."}
{"text":"We stopped by on a Saint Patrick day when most bars and restaurants were full! We grabbed a table here and ordered the sirloin steak with fries, a choice of soup or salad and a choice of tea or coffee was included
The food was more than enough. The 8oz steak was well prepared as ordered. The bill was surprisingly below what I would expect and absolutely worth the money"}
{"text":"We had a 20 minute wait on a busy Friday night. Crowd was mostly loud groups of 50 somethings. I realised why when I looked at the somewhat pricey menu. We're not at Olive Garden.

Surprised to see the bread served with just butter on the side but they will provide olive oil when asked. My manicotti was good and heavy on the cheese and the portion wasn't overwhelming for 17 dollars. Service was also fine."}
{"text":"The establishment it's self is causy and trendy but the food is a little too simple for my taste. I had the spaghetti with meat balls and the sauce was tasteless. Absolutly no salt, no seasoning!! I was under the impression they mixed tomaroe sauce with a couple spices and heat it up. I expected much more for the price you pay. I would truly give it two stars or maybe even one but the service was amazing, everything was fast paced. Maybe that was why my food was bad?"}
{"text":"Excellent food and unique menu selection.

We were looking for a nice dinner in Montreal and spent quite a while looking for someplace more 'upscale' in the downtown area. The menu here looked interesting - Italian,  seafood, a French flare - so we tried it out. No lines, no waiting, BYOW - all good. 

I hadn't tried this place before so didn't know what the mussels were like but really wanted to try them. I think I made the right call by getting the mussels as an appetizer instead of an entry. They were absolutely delicious and they give you plenty, but just personally would prefer a meat/pasta dish as an entree. 

I got the veal marsala as an entree. The sauce was yummy but the meat was a little tough. I won't hold that against them. I would definitely recommend Restaurant l'Academie to anyone looking for a reasonably priced upscale dinner and enjoys mussels."}
{"text":"We liked the overall service. Food was 3.5 out of 5. The Moussel Frite was excellent! But the fish, the spaguetti bolognese and the Veau were a little \"unsalted\".
We were very well atended, 5 stars for that! She even wrote \"obrigado\" in our bill, and we didn't tell her we were Brazilians.
Price was also very reasonable, less than 25 per person, plus tip.
We recommend this restaurant, specially if you go there for Moussel Frite!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here only a handful of times, but it's a winner. Every person I have recommended it to, LOVES it. Like they really love it. They call me and go on and on about how much they loved it. Here's why: it's a fantastic multi-storey restaurant at St. Denis and Duluth, right next to a SAQ. (Actually, that SAQ is now closed...but there's one kiddie-corner...rejoice - Montrealers now how to roll.)

This would be a good time to mention Montreal is huge on BYOW - bring your own wine. Just look for \"approtez votre vin\". And unlike the rest of Canada, they don't charge a corking fee, nor do they stare at you with their judgy little eyes. The Quebecois simply uncork and pour. It's genius - why can't every restaurant do it. 

Now that you have your bottle (or bottles), slip next door and get a table. L'Academie is best described as boisterous. Everyone needs a fail-safe restaurant. This would be it."}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp, so it's possible I was colored by previous reviews. That said I found the decor pleasant, the service impeccable, and food delicious. Went with a group of 6, ordered 5 different pasta dishes, nobody was dissapointed. A much better value than any place else I saw on Crescent, and you'll save on wine too."}
{"text":"You can BYOB!! Pasta portions were good and the price is fair for a restaurant like this. Too bad the waitress was more interested in talking to some regulars than paying attention to anyone else. We had to wait a long time to get our bill and then again to use their card machine while she was chatting. It's a business casual kind of restaurant and there were tables celebrating birthdays and anniversaries when I went this weekend.

I ordered mushroom pasta and they are not kidding when hey say wild mushrooms. It was way too \"woody\" tasting for my liking and I'm a big fan of mushrooms."}
{"text":"We loved this restaurant on a recent trip to Montreal. In fact, we ate their 3 times on a five day trip!   I was surprised to find that this was one of several locations.  It has all the charm of small downtown BYOB, and delicious fresh baguettes served with quality Italian food."}
{"text":"We were in Laval for some meetings and were absolutely starving afterwards. We ended up at L'Academie since it was across the parking lot.

We all ordered the artichoke salad and it was a nice size and pretty good; nice large chunks of artichoke. I had the spaghetti bolongnese, which was decent. No better or worse than what I could do myself at home. However, my colleague's seafood fetucini had gross green clams. I don't know about you, but, to me, clams aren't supposed to be green; they smelled really fishy.

For the $13 - 16 they charge for their entrees, this place isn't really worth it.

Next time I'm in the area, I probably try something else."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time when I won a dinner for 2 at my school. The staff were super friendly and the food was really good! Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We came here for the lobster special. We did not regret it. The dinner was amazing, the service was above board, and the wine we chose at the SAQ across the street was a perfect pairing. Yes that is right you need to bring your own booze. The SAQ being conveniently located across the street is definitely a bonus in situations like these. The fact that the restaurant does not charge a corking fee is another added bonus. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Terrible place. Pretentious and snooty with nothing to back it up. Both times I went were more annoying than the last. I will not go back again ever. I'd rather eat a jar of relish instead."}
{"text":"Mussels and fries were good (we picked the creamy broth). The mussels and calamari (entrance) were not chewy. The parmagiano veal was ok. The veal size was big, few grilled veggies were good, the pasta was ordinary. The restaurant has a promotion all wednesday mussels and fries are 13.95 which is a good price for what you get and it is tasty. Bring your own wine."}
{"text":"This place has a good outlook but everything inside leave you with a big disappointment. The only good thing is they allow you to bring your wine to not to be bothered more with their least effort to make a proper food. The staff are ok but not on top of their job."}
{"text":"We were surprised that the quality of the food seemed like integrated factory processed components. It lacked fresh flavor plus appetizers were cold and had to be sent back.   Pasta carbonara was a soupy plate of pasta, lacking coagulated egg and/or cheese.  The penne pasta with Italian sausage  was ok, but sauce seemed it was from a jar.  Sorry our last dinner in Montreal was a disappointment."}
{"text":"J'√©tais pas all√© depuis 5-6 ans et je crois pas y retourner de si t√¥t. Qualit√© de la nourriture de beaucoup inf√©rieur que par le pass√©. Pas que c'est mauvais. C'est juste que y'a de meilleures options ailleurs pour sensiblement le m√™me prix"}
{"text":"For a place that specializes in pasta, the pasta is pretty boring. I could make the same, if not better, at home! But the decor and ambiance are nice, and the meal is still ok. Service is fine."}
{"text":"Had the fettuccine primavera; it was good but not amazing. Quick and courteous service."}
{"text":"This is a pretty \"meh\" place.  
The food and service is below average for an establishment that is wanting a classier ambience.

Nothing here is delicate.  Everything is pretty heavy and there is no \"art\" to the food.
The only thing that is good about this place is that it is BYOW and you are helping train food service industry workers (I think this is connected to a cooking school yes?)"}
{"text":"I'm from San Francisco, but when I make my 2 yearly trips to Montreal, I have to visit L'Academie!
My favorite dish is the mussels, but the other stuff is good too.
Prices are VERY reasonable and it's a BYO Wine, so you can't beat that.

I always get great service and the ambiance is good too."}
{"text":"How often do you stumble across a BYOW (bring your own wine) restaurant?  As a Torontonian, I haven't!

Although that was not what lured me to Restaurant l'Academie, its an interesting concept.  It is a multi-storey, house-converted restaurant with simple yet elegant decor.  Exposed brick, and white paneled walls makes you feel like you're the home of a housewife who has all the time in the world to fuss over all the elegant details of her humble abode.

The waiter here is probably one of the shyest I've ever met, but he was polite and very friendly.  The food here is French/Italian and the prices are great for the dining experience you get.  I would probably throw down roughly the same amount for a less than stellar meal at Jack Astor's. 

We started off with Escargots and Fried Calamari. Escargot was rather oily and the calamari, albeit having a light batter was not crispy.

For mains I opted for the Sole Meuni√®re and William T. opted for the Linguini Vongole which was a garlic and tomato, white wine pasta.

The fish came with orange cauliflower, carrots and potatoes. It was tender but I felt it was rather bland. The linguini was fantastic. It was a clam pasta and the pasta was very yummy!

Overall good value for your money and great service."}
{"text":"I went to this place for a small snack before class with my friend. I was in search of something different but not too filling so I wouldn't food coma in class ;) The soup of the day was dill and celery root (Yummmm :)), definitely out of the ordinary and very tasty. I ordered the fried calamari entree as my main meal. The calamari was kinda rubbery (but that's pretty normal) and it was breaded with a light and not too greasy batter and served with a yummy marinara sauce. I still had some room and have a weakness for dessert so I asked for the dessert menu. The \"menu\" is actually a tray of available desserts!!! So cool because you can see what you are going to get (not sure if the desserts were real or plastic although I had my suspicions about the ice cream option). I ordered the caramel and nut cheesecake and it was delicious :) Overall it was the perfect meal, only flaws were that my water was never refilled and the extra bread I asked for never arrived :("}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this hot restaurant. There are so many ppl in weekends .I tried mussels with creamy soup, not kinda of astonishing,but it's good. I love the decor, services more than their food anyway."}
{"text":"I was super reluctant to go here at first. L'academie is located on the touristy stretch of Crescent, the reviews seemed mediocre and the lunch special ($10 for pasta or mussels&fries) seemed too cheap to actually taste good.

I was surprised!  L'academie does a decent job looking 'upscale'. There was more of an older crowd, and it was quite busy so make reservations. 

Yays: You're give complimentary bread and butter, and I should mention an unlimited amount. Bring your own wine and no corkage fee? Sweet! My friends' pastas all looked pretty good, and they were the perfect portion to fill you up, but not leave you feeling stuffed. The mussels were pretty good, and it was my first time ever trying them. The fries were average- I wish they were crispier. The service was quick, sharp and efficient...at first. 

Nays: As time progressed, it seemed like our waiter forgot about us. We had to get up from our table, stand in the middle of the restaurant to wave him down. He didn't check on us to see if we needed more bread, pour more glasses of water, or ask us how the food was.
The bread wouldn't been much better warmed up. Also, the mussels were sitting in more of a broth than a sauce. The fries should've been crispier as well.

All in all, I would come back. Why? Because it's cheap n' somewhat classy."}
{"text":"It was my second return to L'academie and it was consistently present with the first visit. my girlfriend and I treated her mom and godmother to a nice dinner in Montreal at L'academie. We love this place so much as you can bring your own wine with no corking fee. we had an enjoyable dinner with great appetizers. I am unsure why but to our delight when we received our bills most of the meals were half price it could have been because we had eaten during the week. I can't wait to go back to this restaurant upon our return to Montreal, it is a city favorite!"}
{"text":"Second time I went there with colleagues. Not much impressed by the restaurant. I ordered a Nabasta or something which is the salmon fettuccine. The amount of salmon was good but the white sauce was so salty, it seems something went wrong in the kitchen. Also, who the hell on earth can miss a noodle cooking? There were some bunch of noddles stuck together. We were a group of six and my command was mixed up. I was presented with a plate of mussels. Had to wait 15 minutes more to get my plate.

Well, I don't know watch is the problem of this restaurant but they should get some lessons to learn how to cook pasta. Boil the water, put some salt in the water, put the fettuccine inside the boiling water, stir sometime to avoid sticky noodles, after 12 min, remove the noodle and there goes your recipe.

Last time I go there."}
{"text":"I've never been the the L'Academie at St-Denis, so I cannot compare. I will assume the quality is comparable. I went to L'acadmie hearing not so great reviews, however I am one to never trust the opinions of the masses(we'll only on Yelp :P).

Food Quality/Price - 2.5/5
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Firstly, I  want to mention that this is a BYOW (bring your wine). I adore this concept, mainly because I detest paying the premium when ordering wine at a restaurant. However, this is how many restaurants make the lion's share of their revenues. 

That being said majority of BYOW restaurants are usually sub-par in the food quality because they cut corners to beef up profit margins. Unfortunately, L'acadamie is no exception, they food is \"palatable\", yet the prices are fair. Its saving grace is that it is a BYOW.

Ambiance/Service - 4/5
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ambiance and service are great. The food was served in a timely manner and the wait staff was courteous. Also, I loved the novel idea of actually showing patrons the desert before they order directly at their table. The ambiance was appropriate for  a mid tier crescent street \"hot spot\" and as decorations were not too garish making for a decent dining experience.

Overall - B-
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I would go back to L'acadamie, solely because its BYOW. The take home message of this review is that if your looking for great food look elsewhere. However, if your looking for a good time and place you can bring your own wine(or beer), L'acadamie will fit the bill."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  Its modern and classy decor.  This is a nice romantic dinner date or a good place to bring a small group of friends. You bring your own bottle of wine.  The mussels are yummy and that's all I go for.  All the flavors are good.  I usually like the white creamy cheese soup one- Rockafello and comes with yummy fries to dip. They're known for the mussels.  Wednesdays are half off mussels ($13) fyi!"}
{"text":"L'Academie is my go-to restaurant for mussels and fries. With a good part of their menu devoted to pasta, meat and seafood dishes, there is a lot of choice for everyone. But with seven different mussel preparations, I slip into a mussels' mindset as soon as I walk up to the multi-level restaurant. On a Monday evening during a holiday week, the restaurant filled up quickly with office parties and large family celebrations. Luckily, we were able to score a banquette seat on the main level to people watch.

I was in the mood for calamari as a starter, thinking it would complement the rest of the meal. Unfortunately, the squid was soft and mushy and the coating, soggy instead of crispy. Definitely, not recommended. The field greens side salad with the creamy house dressing was much better, refreshing and tasty.

For the main course, I ordered the mussels (special pricing Sunday-Wednesday) prepared Mariniere-style, with a white wine, butter and lemon broth. As always, the mussels were delicious. And the fries, served with mayonnaise, were exactly how I like them. This dish is the reason I return.

When we saw the dessert tray, we had to stay. I tried the pecan pie - with its creamy filling and crusty pecan topping - and carrot cake. The former was delicious, with a robust, sweet filling. The carrot cake, however, was just okay - not great.

Service was fine. The staff refilled our bread basket frequently so that we could take full advantage of the flavorful broth."}
{"text":"We were walking by this place and decided to stop in because of how busy the front patio, which is right on the sidewalk, seemed to be. Glad we did. 

The prices weren't too bad. 

We tried the moules frites and snail gnocchi. The mussels were awesome. They were large and plump, not shriveled like at many places. The leftover soup was delicious. You get a large pot of mussels. As for the gnocchi, the snails and mushrooms went together very well. The snail was tender and flavorful. The gnocchi was a bit dense but overall still quite good."}
{"text":"One of our friends recommended this place for our 5a7. We made a reservation. We were sitting on the 2nd floor. Great ambiance, dimmed lights, it wasn't too crowded ( around 6). I ordered the canelloni as my main dish. I don't often ordered pasta at a restaurant because I find it expensive for the portion they serve. I did enjoy my plate. Really good canellonis. We brought our own wines. At the end of our meals, the server brought a platter of many desserts exposed in front of us instead of a simply dessert menu. It does surely looked really good. Ended up trying the tiramisu cup. Nothing special about the tiramisu, classic one.  Overall i had an enjoyable evening and would recommend this place for small events."}
{"text":"Just wanted to update my review. 

The reason for the overcooked pasta was that it wasn't eaten immediately. It was indeed a delivery that had probably continued to cook while in the sauce.

So perhaps I'd give this place a shot if I was dining in.

Upgrading to 3 stars. One for good customer service (the restaurant owner got in touch to offer a valid explanation) and another one giving it the benefit of doubt."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised. The ambience is ideal. The food isn't bad. The pasta was very tasty. I agree with others, the calamari was mediocre but overall it was a good experience.

I feel bad about the workers there, we were a group of 15 or so people and only one girl was there serving us.


Update (September 2017): Went again, had the same pasta, still as tasty as I remember. 

FYI, kitchen closes around 10pm but the restaurant closes at 11:30pm."}
{"text":"We ate here after viewing the Faberge exhibit at the museum. The food was definitely in the 4 star range. The service was also very nice and attentive. We were pleased and highly recommend L'Academe Crescent when in Montreal."}
{"text":"So as I am still somewhat new to Montreal, I have to keep reminding me of these places that let you bring your own wine.  l'Academie is one of those places.  Great deal to bring your own wine, but you need to remember ahead of time.  I was meeting three others and realized I needed wine so took a walk for a few blocks to Sainte-Catherine & Drummond to find an SAQ to buy my wine at...no big deal, could use the exercise!

Regarding the meal itself, I have to say I was a little disappointed.  There is nothing specifically wrong with this place, but nothing stood out either.  The food was average, the service was good.  I started with garlic escargot that was decent enough, but not distinctive in any way.  I then ate seared tuna for my main dish.  Again, mediocre.   Price is pretty good, however, compared to many restaurants in the area,"}
{"text":"Come here for my girls love of pasta, the byow and cute servers. If you are on a high sodium diet, don't even come within one block cause everything is really too salty. Didn't pay attention to the fact they left the door open and was freezing for people around there. Crazy loud crowd upstairs harmed the relaxing environment and made it sound more like a frat party than a French restaurant. Great location though"}
{"text":"A Bring Your Own Wine with a Sunday - Wednesday special is good in my books! 
The food is good, especially when you can accompany it with as much wine as you choose to bring with you! The staff is young and nice, and the restaurant has a very clean, modern, classy look. 
They've got a special on pasta & muscles everyday at lunch & Sunday-Wednesdays for dinner, 11,95$ accompanied with a soup or salad.
I've been to he one on St.Denis and my pasta tasted like cigarettes and our server was miserable, and kind of rude. So I definitely recommend the one on Crescent!
I plan on going there this week! :)"}
{"text":"Great Price & Great Food!"}
{"text":"The best thing about this restaurant is that it's good for large groups. That and you can bring your own wine. The food isn't so great though. I've only ever had the mussels (on promo too) so it was decently priced for what it was, but I wouldn't get them otherwise. They're drenched in sauce, which can be quite salty. The service I had both times were rather slow, especially given how empty the restaurant was. From what my friends ordered, the pasta doesn't look too bad, but portions are small. To be honest I wouldn't come here unless there was a special/large event. 

Edit: Not sure how to reply to comments, but sorry Lawrence about that! I've edited my review so it doesn't contain any unjustified claims."}
{"text":"My friend and I were here, looking for mussels and fries close to the Fine Arts Museum. Conveniently, we went on a Sunday and they run a special Sunday-Wednesday on mussels and fries for, I believe, ~$14. We were greeted by the pleasant staff who let us know it's BYOB, and pointed us in the right direction towards a nearby liquor store.
My friend order the Italian while I ordered the Mariniere. I'd give the food 3 stars, good but not particularly exceptional. 

I wish I was able to give this restaurant 3.5 stars. However, I decided to round up to a 4 star review, rather than 3, because of the exceptional service and great deal on the mussels. Our waiter was very pleasant and the food was good considering the price. I'm not sure if I'd return here and pay the normal price of $19 for my entree, but I can imagine coming back if I'm ever in the area and wanted mussels and fries."}
{"text":"The food is fine.  The customer service is horrendous.  We drove 6 hours from NY.  We walked 30 min from St. Catherine.  My wife hardly ate half of her meal.  My son did not touch his.  The manager asked us if we wanted our food \"to go.\"  We said \"yes.\"  The manager threw out our food which he said \"My mistake.  It happens.\"

Lawrence, the manager showed no remorse to replace my wife's meal.  Are all Quebec businesses like this? This would never happen in America.

Horrendous customer experience."}
{"text":"I did not enjoy my meal here at this BYOB establishment.

The fried calamari was extremely oily.

The seafood linguini was tasteless.

The lentil soup was predictable and boring.

Perhaps the only redeeming dish was the mussels in a pot. 

Decided to give dessert a skip as I didn't think it would taste good."}
{"text":"This restaurant was AMAZING. I came here on a short trip with my boyfriend, the food was so good I wanted to eat here every night but he wanted to explore other places. In short, nothing we found compared to how good the food was or the price. A must in Montreal."}
{"text":"This little BYOB spot is definitely a little over priced for the quality f the food. I went out there with 4 people and we some good seafood served to us. The pasta on the other side was decent, but was not restaurant worthy, more like a home cooked pasta dish.
All in all i would recommend it for the atmosphere, but keeping in mind the price for the quality of food"}
{"text":"Mediocre Italian cuisine.
I've been to this branch of l'Academie a couple of times and I have been disappointed on each occasion. The food was unremarkable and tasteless at best. I had watery mussels that tasted like nothing, and the pasta was too salty and creamy. I did not bother taking pictures because it looked like a cheesy mess. To top it off, the service was slow even when the restaurant was almost empty.
For this price range I would recommend going somewhere else for better Italian food."}
{"text":"This place is pretty much my dream. Its BYOB and they have cheap specials on pasta and mussels from Sunday - Wednesday (or Thursday?) not including holidays. The staff are cheery and their desserts are well portioned. Its a great place for a one on a first date or for a group dinner to celebrate a birthday (I do both). Only downside is that BYOB doesn't cover hard liquor or else my friends and I would be there WAY too often. It tries to look classy but it's a student and middle class place to eat.

Food:  8/10
Service:  7/10
Price:  9/10
Atmosphere:  9/10"}
{"text":"Our hotel recommended this restaurant for a late night dinner. We made a reservation on Open Table to secure our spot. Upon arrival we waited a bit for someone to greet and seat us. My husband actually had to go and alert a server that we were waiting to be seated. For that, they lose a star. Once seated the service went well. After our waiter explained all the items, we opted to order from the pre-fix menu. For the first course I had the spring mix salad with homemade vinegarette and beets. It was light and refreshing, the dressing was very good. For the second course I ordered the piglet filet with honey dijon dressing which came with roasted potatoes, candied beets and vegetables. I decided to try something new and it was done well. My husband ordered the broccoli and roquefort soup and duck confit risotto. It was delish and very hearty. The restaurant allowed BYOB which was lovely. After out meal we were not rushed we sat, drank and talked on our last night in Montreal"}
{"text":"BAh, un peu d√©cevant encore une fois. Le pain servi est tr√®√®√®√®√®√®s bon, √ß√† en est m√™me dangereux. Les plats principaux sont ordinaires. J'ai pris les moules/frites qui √©taient corrects. Mon conjoint a pris la poutine au filet mignon. Comme tous les restaurants ont maintenant leur version de la poutine, L'academie a suivi le pas, mais le travail n'a pas √©t√© r√©ussi du tout, elle est a √©vit√©e. Bref, je ne m'attendais pas √† plus, pas le choix quand tous les resto abordable apporter votre vin de Laval sont pleins pour recevoir un groupe de 16. 

Par contre, tr√®s abordable. Moules/frites et p√¢tes √† 9.95$ du dimanche au jeudi... hmmmm √† ce prix, on doit peut-√™tre se poser des questions...."}
{"text":"Pretty cheap prices for a good amount of food that tastes good. It's a fancy restaurant but they can apparently afford to have lower prices because the chefs are students, I've been here 3 times and 2/3 times there was something slightly wrong with my dish, but they quickly brought me new one that was perfect so I was happy. (the issues were that the filet mignon wasn't cooked evenly - one piece was very very raw inside.. and the other issue was that the calamari wasn't crispy and they were chewy.. the server was happy to bring a fresh one right away.. we also had water in our bread dish so everything was soggy but again they brought a fresh plate almost immediately, overall I think the food is great when its done properly and its worth it on their deal nights - like Thursday night veal or chicken is cheaper and really tasty, I will go again."}
{"text":"Very poor customer service. I like their 'moules frites' but making a reservation with these people... You better adhere to their schedule, and the person on the other end of the line made me feel like i couldn't be trusted to make a reservation and to show up on his timeline. He was rude and abrasive and i try to be as cordial as possible.

Another time the waitress wouldn't let our table of 15-20 leave without giving her a tip. I don't remember it being written as mandatory, and her attitude throughout the evening didn't entice us to reward her with gratuities.

Domage... The food is good value at a good price."}
{"text":"Had dinner there with my wife on Sunday.  Nice place with big beautiful windows.  I ordered a Caesar salad with the Flemish mussels and she ordered the Beef table d'h√¥te special dish.  Caesar was nice and light (not too garlicky). Also ordered Creme Br√ªl√©e which was delish! This place is very reasonable plus you can bring your own wine. We got there just before a huge lineup plus lots of reservations.  Will definitely return but will make a reservation for a weekend dinner!"}
{"text":"Impressively unpleasant experience with the staff. There are many better options with much better service and food along Crescent. Especially for a salad, try Mandy's across the street. My recommendation would be the superfood salad."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend on her birthday to try out the muscles and fries, only to find out that apparently they stopped serving mussels weeks prior because the ones the restaurant received were \"sandy\". So we had to settle for a pasta dish that was bland and tasted like something that was made in 5 min. After paying the bill and heading back downstairs, we noticed 4 people had a plate of muscles in front of them. (???) Went to complain the host, who was rude and said we didn't order early enough...
Definitely don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food consistently good. Prices are reasonable.  Bring your own wine.  Have been here multiple times.  Have not been disappointed yet.  Wait staff friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Wonderful cuisine with an elegant and modern ambience. Service was friendly and attentive. Food is priced how you would expect for a nice restaurant, but the fact that you can bring your own wine or beer makes it more palatable for those on a budget."}
{"text":"Nourriture correcte. J'ai trouv√© le service un peu lent, mais comme on √©tait un moyen groupe je ne le reproche pas. J'ai seulement trouv√© le repas ordinaire."}
{"text":"Very good Italian cuisine. I had the linguine with pesto but the mussels and fries looked great. I can see why everybody likes this place."}
{"text":"Don't go. Especially if you have a good allergy. They added gluten to my meal. I swear. Colleagues had over cooked pasta. No one finished their meals. It was a sad company dinner. I will not go back. There are much nicer and more affordable BYOB restaurants in Montreal."}
{"text":"We had to eat and escape the tropical heat, and L'academie was dead in front of us. I loved the ambiance, chic lime-green downstairs, gray/raspberry combo upstairs.. They have a bunch of great deals for lunch: 13$ mussels with fries and salad, or the swift 10$ lunch special (soup + seashell/calamari and 2 other combos). There is a wide choice of mussels even at such low price, and you get a good liter of 'em. Delicious. Don't go for the seashell though, it's out of the IGA frozen aisle. Nothing to write home about, but for 10$, I'm picking hairs.
The low rating stands mainly for the service, of which there is none. Your hipster waitress will stay behind her tiny counter, checking out the computer, not knowing what the menu is..The place is pretty understaffed, and the wait is long. I was underwhelmed by the paper tablecloth, hiding massive wine stains on the underlying tablecloth. Mmmm.."}
{"text":"Last time I went there, the waitresses kept us waiting for an hour to order. This time, I barely ate my food and told the waitress to pack it as to go, they confirmed that, and threw it away. Also, food there is simply tastless. And the waitresses' attitude is the worst all the way through these. Feels like I am paying a bunch to be treated rudely. Not going again ever."}
{"text":"Made last minute reservations on 17NYE18, and got taken in immediately. 

The ambiance is very nice, comfortable setting in which you can enjoy a private conversation, yet enjoy the hustle and bustle of an open concept restaurant.

I'm visiting, so didn't realize that it's BYOB, that would have been an extra treat with the tasty meal served.

The rack of lamb was absolutely delicious, the duck marget was tasty, but probably wouldn't reorder, and the creme brulee rounded off a pleasant dining experience.

Service was friendly, attentive, especially on a busy night."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.

Went there on a Wednesday night, very bad service and very disappointed.

We waited for an hour to get our main dishes,
while every other tables beside me gets the food and finished.

We ordered two sorts of linguinis. First, she asked me if I would like some parseman. I said yes. She never came back at least I asked her again.

Then I also ask her \"Can you change my ustensils?\"

She said that we usually keep our ustensils until the end. I mean, I aready had my appetizer. And last time when I came to this restaurant, they changed me up. Why each of waitress is saying different things?

One's saying that we should keep it, the others changes me up when I ask.

The waitress never came back to fill up my water, she never came back to ask if all the dishes tastes good.

I wish I had another waitress for my table. The other waitresses seems to be very nice. Maybe I was just unlucky."}
{"text":"I don't usually give bad reviews but the service here is actually terrible!! We had a work dinner, someone told me before not to go here because all the servers are rude and they were not wrong. I'm  made reservations a week in advance and I called a day before to change the time to half an hour earlier, and the guy says how there isn't even a reservation under my name.. first red flag. We had three different waiters and they all made comments about something and made us feel uncomfortable. The one who brought us our food got all sarcastic and annoyed when we were trying to figure out who ordered what (since some of us ordered the same thing). When we were paying, the guy was going on and on about how tip is usually 15% minimum, and asked if the service was bad. I told him what was wrong and he still wanted me to tip him 15% minimum and how he has to pay taxes and stuff. I tipped but I'm never going back. (You shouldn't have to push for tips).... oh and on top of all that, all the food is as bland as it gets"}
{"text":"The service and ambience are good, but the food was pretty mediocre for the price. A solid option for a group BYOB dinner, but don't forget to bring your own booze as you can't buy it there."}
{"text":"Mussels & Fries are very good. Chic place with deals on given days."}
{"text":"WE loved this place.  The waiter was great, very outgoing and accommodating.  The major plus is that they are BYOB.  The Mussel section was a big hit with our kids.  They did make one mistake that was more than made up for.  We told the waiter that we don't eat meat, but our Caesar salad came out with bacon on it.  But the waiter bought us four desserts.  In a way we were glad he made that mistake.  We realize that no place can be perfect, it's how you handle your mistakes.  And they went above and beyond.  Kudos to the management there for letting the staff make quick decisions to handle mistakes."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful time here-food was great, weather was amazing (outside seating was enjoyable) and the waitress was super nice. 

I usually don't like cream based pasta, but the waitress told us that it was the most popular, so I trusted her and it was so good! The mussels were also really great, although the mussels themselves were tiny. Sweet potato fries that came with the mussels were really good too. Overall, great."}
{"text":"My BF and I were visiting Montreal for the weekend. We didn't make any reservations a week in advance so most restaurants did not have availability. We decided to just come here since it was close to where we were staying. 


We didn't expect much because this place didn't have high reviews like the other restaurants we tried to get reservations at. However we were surprised how friendly the service was and the food was great for the price you pay.

We didn't know it was BYOB so we asked for a wine 
menu and the waitress told us where the closest liquor store was. What's really amazing about this place is that it's BYOB and no corking fee! Usually in NY the cheapest is like $10 per bottle. 

We ordered the mussels and the duck and both entrees were great. I'm a huge fan of mussels and I really liked the sauce. We will definitely come back again the next time we are in Montreal."}
{"text":"Oh come on now!  I am shocked by all the good reviews.  The restaurant isn't too hard on the eyes, but really that's all it has going for it.  I know some people are excited because you can bring your own wine, but so what?  This most certainly isn't the only place that offers this, yes even in Toronto never mind Montreal where this concept has been familiar for ages.

The food was pretty crappy.  My partner's peppercorn tuna had no peppercorns.  Worse yet, a good part of it was inedible, full of gristle.  I had a taste and wished I could turn back time and decline the offer.  YUCK!  The swordfish I had was better, but had almost no flavour.  In contrast, the veggies had too much nasty flavour.  I'm betting it was MSG or some other additive.  Though I didn't have a full out allergic reaction, my stomach was queasy after; ergo, I deffo conclude \"flavour enhancer\".  Yes the portions were large, but bigger sure as hell doesn't mean better in this case."}
{"text":"I have never understood the hype around this place.  The food is average at best.  I've had cream-based pesto here which is just nasty and not authentic at all.  Even the basic tomato sauce is pretty bad.  I find it very acidic and overall lacking in flavour."}
{"text":"I am always satisfied when I come here. Good food, BYOW, friendly service, cheap prices. Overall good."}
{"text":"We sat down - only people at the restaurant - and placed an order. 40 minutes later, and on the verge of walking out anyway, a different waiter came up to us and let us know our waiter left and our order wasn't clear (read: wasn't placed)."}
{"text":"Food is below average.
please don't call it Italian food.

Never going there again. 

I had 2 bits from my plate I couldn't finish it, I told  them the meat is dry ( microwave dry) and they wanted to offer me a free coffee and desert I said no thank you. paid the full bill and left to eat somewhere els.

Sad place."}
{"text":"Pour c√©l√©brer la fin des cours et la graduation de certain, nous avons r√©serv√©s √† l'Acad√©mie un jeudi soir pour un groupe de 15. 
L'accueil fut des plus mauvais : pour un resto de ce style, nous √©tions surprise de voir que l'h√¥tesse √©tait habill√©e d'un jeans rose pale, d'une camisole digne d'une plage et des gougounes dans les pieds. Son accueil fut √† son image : \"ouais..?\". WOW! Un peu plus et je l'imaginais m√¢cher une gomme √† l'image d'une vache. J'√©tais assez bouche-b√©e par son accueil si d√©sagr√©able. Son patron a embarqu√© et nous a poliment demand√© si nous avions une r√©servation (oui), puis nous informa que la table allait bient√¥t se lib√©rer. 

Comme c'√©tait un gros groupe, notre section √©tait √† l'√©tage, qui √©tait assez joli. Une fois en haut, le service fut absolument excellent, la serveuse super sympa et les busboy (je pr√©sume) tr√®s attentionn√©s √† remplir nos verres d'eau et d√©barasser la table discr√®tement. 

Nous avons tous aim√© nos plats, aucune surprise d√©sagr√©able quant aux prix et nous avons beaucoup appr√©ci√© le 15% de rabais sur pr√©sentation de la carte d'abonnement du Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts."}
{"text":"I went there with no expectations from this restaurant because I had heard in the past it really wasn't anything impressive. People go there mostly because it's bring your own wine, which attracts a pretty annoying and loud crowd. My girlfriend and I met our friends there for a double date. I ordered pasta, she ordered steak. 

Worst pasta I have ever eaten in my life. Literally tasted like Lipton Soup (and I'm not exaggerating). My girlfriend's steak was also awful and over-cooked. Tried to get something else instead but the server never came back after giving us our food. 

Also there was a huge group of 20 17 years old girls sitting next to us who were literally yelling and singing the whole time. I don't think I have ever experienced something this bad in a restaurant in Montreal. I would compare it to going to St-Hubert on Saint-Catherine during the Jazz festival. Don't do it."}
{"text":"Repas de caf√©teria. La qualit√© de la nourriture s'est nettement d√©grad√© durant les derni√®res ann√©es comparativement au pic de sa gloire.

Nous avons pris des moules a l'Italienne (petites et sauce tr√®s s√ªr), une salade de calmar frits (en fait, c'est plut√¥t 2 entr√©es, soit une salade c√©sar avec trop de sauce et soit des calmars frits moins que ordinaires) et des raviolis aux 3 fromages (plus fade que ceux de can du chef Boyardi).

Place pour aller boire seulement, car c'est un apportez votre vin (BYOB). Autrement, allez manger ailleurs au Centropolis."}
{"text":"Service was not bad. Food was pretty bad. The fennel mint soup was really good. It was extremely busy so maybe that played into it.  Wouldn't return"}
{"text":"To be fair to this restaurant, you need to rate it according to the type of restaurant that it is. To the American readers, I would compare L'Academie to a better version of Cheesecake Factory. It was loud, the service a bit uneven but the food was solid. I think that it is a perfect restaurant for groups or for a dinner date on a budget. It's Bring Your Own Wine and there is a good selection of fairly affordable dishes.

I had a plate of mussels and fries. The mussels were big and clean. The broth was tasty and the fries homemade (so was the mayo... I think)

Overall, I'm not gonna be dreaming about this restaurant but it was pretty good... for what it is!"}
