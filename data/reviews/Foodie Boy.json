{"text":"The milk tea is good .   but I prefer marathon.     It is in a busy spot in second floor if p mall.  But marathon sometime has better parking outside of dum sum hours.    I the food looked sad."}
{"text":"Got their small milk tea-so delicious! Silky smooth, fragrant and the right amount of sweetness. Better than Marathon's milk tea and the perfect pick-me-up after a long day. Got the chance to see them mix the tea too!"}
{"text":"The milk tea is good, although I prefer the milk tea at Marathon. I'd say that this tea is stronger, but it's a lot less sweet. It's a little more expensive too.   Located in the 2nd floor of pacific mall in a section that has a handful of food court stores"}
{"text":"Overall - 3.5/5.0  Tried their HK milk tea which recently won first place in the Kam Cha International Competition.   It was good but definitely a notch below Marathon's milk tea in terms of the creaminess and depth of flavour.   Not sure if I would go back just for it, as parking in Pacific Mall is a sh*t show especially on weekends."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting anything special considering I want to grab a quick snack before work but the wait for the food was a serious turn off. The HK Milk tea I got was OK, wasn't anything special similar quality to Marathon like what other yelpers say but not as good, almost like a \"cheap\" imitation. Wasn't actually cheaper than marathon though LOL. The prices in my opinion are expensive for what you get. The actual food is OK but HK Cafe style food is simple and easy to make anyways. Going on the assumption that a drink was included in the price I opted for a cold milk tea and ended up paying just over $10 for a milk tea and satay beef instant noodle dish. Anywhere else in Markham/Scarborough this meal would be less than $8 . I'm by no means \"cheap\" but I just felt ripped off. Probably would not return considering there was MANY other options foot steps aways"}
{"text":"Came for some snacks, this afternoon.  The stall is at the mini-food court, where Beard Papas used to be.  The hot and cold HK style milk teas are really good.  The toast wasn't good at all, barely toasted(see pic).  My daughter ordered the All Day Breakfast(with sausage), she enjoyed it.    I would definitely return for the making milk teas but not for the food."}
{"text":"Authentic HK milk tea.  Will definitely return for my fix of HK food.  Apparently the owner won some kind of milk tea competition."}
{"text":"I did not get the milk tea. I came for the curry fish/beef balls. They're $2.50 for 5, or $4 for 10. I got the $4 option. I asked for all beef balls, and just as I was about to ask for a mix of the two, the lady inside asked me if I could do a mix instead. It worked out, so that was all fine and dandy. The curry here is surprisingly aromatic. I would not liken this to Chinese curry. It smells more like a Malaysian or Indian curry? It's spicy, in a leaves-your-tongue-tingly-after-eating kinda way. I liked the fish balls more than the beef balls (unusual for me). They've got a nice texture while being soft. I gave my parents some as well, and my dad thought they were from that famous fish ball place in the Heritage Centre. That was kinda cool."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their hot HK milk tea.  It is smooth and the flavor intense!  I've ordered their cold version before but it just tastes really watered down.  I would definitely recommend the hot HK milk tea!"}
{"text":"Being in a food court,  the special was OK.  Nothing special to wow you but the Garlic roll with condensed milk was quite interesting.   The roll was a regular bun toasted, could do with more body but not bad. The milk tea had good flavor but not piping hot.  Will drop by on a few weeks when they work out the kinks"}
{"text":"2016 North America Champion for Hong Kong Milk Tea Competition  The quality of their Milk Tea is good. The level of creaminess and sweetness can be requested  I usually like mine less sweet and more milk if you want the smoother mouth feel.  We also try the Curry Fish Balls and Beef Balls ($4 for 2 or $2.50 each) which was so so. I would skip that and just enjoy my Milk Tea."}
