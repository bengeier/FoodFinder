{"text":"We love this place for brunch ; we go there often the food is excellent and the ambiance is great , specially out of the deck. They can try to improve the service by hiring a more experienced staff , but overall we highly recommend the eggs benedictine ; the portions are  generous and fresh."}
{"text":"Eggs, waffles, French toast, fresh-squeezed juices, fresh fruit, bacon, etc.; long menu; healthy to decadent breakfasts; delicious, fresh  French pastries; expanded interior dining room, so less crowded; outside seating in summer; pioneer home/new renovation inside; Better-prepared meals and lower prices than similar franchise restaurants."}
{"text":"Best eggs benedict I've had! Service is great, they make an effort to accommodate English which is more than I can say for sooo many businesses in that area and Vaudreuil in general. Very small family place, awesome food and they have pretty tasty baked goods to take home also. Go,... you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"It's a nice local place with a wide variety of selections for breakfast. It can be a bit crammed but I guess that's part of the aesthetic."}
{"text":"Today I decided to bring my kids here for lunch... big mistake!  Ordered and waited almost an hour (their lunch hour is only 1 hour long). people who arrived 10 minutes after us were all served and leaving and we still had nothing on our table!!  Asked: whats up? we need to eat!  The owner says that the pizza that we ordered takes longer.  Ya! the \"pizza\" that consists of Nutella and cheese and banana spread on a Naan bread!! Really?!  So the kids were starving, and late, and the whole experience of being taken out for lunch ruined (we rarely eat out so this was a special thing for them). 40$ meal for 2 kids (I only ordered a coffee, which I was never given).  No apology was offered; the owner wouldnt even look at me when I paid.  And to top it off, the 1 hour Naan pizza was so tough I couldn't even cut it with a steak knife. my kid's jaw hurt from it and so he couldn't even finish his food.  A very very disappointing experience to say the least!"}
{"text":"This is our 5th time eating here. Up to now, this place was a hands down 5 star for food quality, selection and service.   Unfortunately, today is Father's Day and even with a reservation made weeks ago the staff was unable to deliver the same quality of service I have been used to getting.   We waited over 30 mins to have someone take our order. And then waited to another 30mins for someone to bring out just our bread that accompanies our meal...then it got soggy and cold waiting another 15 mins for our food.   You should note that the food here is quite delicious.  But I brought my closest friends here after bragging about how great this restaurant was and ultimately everyone I brought was not impressed, making me incredibly embarrassed.   I would also suggest some type of air conditioning as it was so hot and humid inside the restaurant that no one could enjoy the food.   I'm really hoping this was a one-off miss but I'm not sure if I can trust coming back.  We will see."}
