{"text":"Terrible service. literally sat at the bar in front of the bartender for 20 mins while he ignored us. Then a couple sat down right beside us and the bartender introduced himself to them and served them right away. at that point i got up and walked out"}
{"text":"This pub should be better than it is and that is not to suggest it is bad.  There just seems to be something lacking. Went in for lunch on Sunday aft and there wasn't a lot going on.  The pub is hollow and not particularly warm. Maybe has to do with open space or laminate flooring. Maybe it just hasn't gained character yet since it is new.   Alrighty then, our server was attentive and helpful. The beer special was reasonable enough to order a draught and there were appetizing food specials.  Opted for the Roast Turkey Poutine.  Wow! Who knew a Thanksgiving Christmas Easter meal could be so delicious on fries and cheese curd? Portion was huge and delicious!   Again, a good spot that I try occasionally and don't mind recommending."}
{"text":"Not that great, wouldn't spend my money there, luckily I was bought lunch there. (visited during stampede week forgot to post review)  Sat on the patio.  Had chicken sandwich with chips Chips were stale, they would be better off buying kettle chips in a bag and putting them on a plate instead. I recommend the Costco salt and pepper kettle chips to go with the food."}
{"text":"We stopped here eat as part of pub crawl around the area, the male host informed us we were being too loud and hinted at us to leave. Luckly for us, we didn't get to eat the terrible food. To bad for them, our bill at the next stop was around $500...   They should be nicer to large groups of people."}
{"text":"The wings are perfect sized and so cheap! We go here for date nights quite a bit. Sometimes they have live bands which have always played great music. Very talented people, awesome service, great wings."}
{"text":"Toad and Turtle is my fav spot for Friday afternoon casual office lunches, or to meet friends during my lunch hour. The food is always REALLY good, The bar section is large and has a nice feel to it and they have a great patio- I will even drive out here on a sunny saturday just to sit on such a nice patio. My only recommendation though is to take your lunch late if you are going to go here on a weekday- I have been here at 11:30am weekday and seen it go from dead to fully packed/over worked waitresses in a half an hour. So just show up around 1:30 and you'll have a great time."}
{"text":"Food was good, beer was cold, service kinda sucked. Seems that in the few lunches I've gone to there it wasn't very busy, but the waitresses seemed to care more for their phones than the customers."}
{"text":"Had tried a few of the other places in the area for a Sunday Brunch, and wanted to try something new.  This place didn't have a 15 minute wait when we arrived and got a table and service right away; so that was a plus right off the bat.  Breakfast/Brunch menu has some really creative options that will cure that hangover from the night before.  Really hearty meals with lots of protein and carbs to help get you going.   Sundays (at the time we went) they have Caesars on special; and they have a few different ones to try - the perfect pair for a Sunday Brunch. I had the Breakfast Poutine. I was a large serving loaded with lots of ingredients and topped off with ample amounts of cheese curds and Hollandaise sauce.  It really filled the void in my stomach and I was stuffed when it was all gone.  The price was very fair too.  I will be going back to try the other breakfast items in the near future!"}
{"text":"Very pleasant way to spend an evening.  Friendly and helpful service. Good beer selection. Good menu selection. And for a pub, the food surpassed expectations. Not gourmet, but better than you might expect.  And staff/management always have some kind of activity going on when there's a crowd. I'l be happy to go back."}
{"text":"Decent pub food, with a good atmosphere, especially on the upstairs patio, which has a beach theme and large overhead heaters.  Food and drink prices are reasonable, if not cheap.  Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Solid Pub.  Nothing spectacular, but good wings (try the sweet chili) and good selection of pints on tap"}
{"text":"3 of us went for dinner, i enjoyed half priced appetizers, my husband had the rib special and my friend enjoyed 1/2 price wings.  The service was great , the food was not....Everything was so salty that unfortunately half of our food went uneaten.  Good thing we all ordered sale items, though it still came to an $80 bill...with no booze!"}
{"text":"3 stars for the pub, 1 star for the friendly waitresses.  The selection of drafts is not bad at all, but the food is only okay. Wednesday nights are wing nights, a wing will cost you 30 cents. There are a wide sauce options for the wings, but I am not able to say that the sauces that I have tried so far have been impressive. But at 30 cents a piece, you can not go wrong.  Try the nachos too, it was HUGE."}
{"text":"I've been here several times since my hotel is really close to it.  Great food (pulled pork and brisquet are very good), nice beer selection (over 20 beers on tap), good music, lots of tvs, cute and friendly bartenders, clean, plenty of seating and parking."}
{"text":"If possible would give it no stars - worst service ever, took over twenty minutes for our server to come back with our drinks and then never came back to ask if wanted anything else"}
{"text":"Very nice place. Very clean, friendly, and a great place to hang out with friends. You can actually talk to and hear each other. I tried the pizza. It was OK. I  would eat it again, but not my first choice. The waitress was prompt and friendly. She seemed to time her visits when I didn't have a mouthful. Oh, and the beer is good. Erdinger Dunkel. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Another great deep south east Calgary pub option!   I've dropped into TnT a few times now, including once for our National Chicken Wing Day Wing Eating Competition, and I have to say the team at the Toad is great to work with and the service each time has been top notch. I love the fact they have two of my fave craft beers available (Village and Toolshed) and the chicken wings at this place are off the hook! Easily some of the biggest wings you'll find in town on a wing night, and a ton of flavours to choose from, including their weekly special wing flavour. I believe me, I know chicken wings.  I dropped in on a Saturday morning at 10am for their $5.99 breakfast deal and left stuffed.   Great patio on the rooftop, and lesser awesome patio on the side which unfortunately gets traffic going by it constantly but still lets you sit out in the sun.  Two wings up for this place!"}
{"text":"I think they will do ok, good location but limited menu to start. Biggest issue was that the establishment has clearly not set up their beer choices correctly. I ordered a pint of bud and when it arrived it was a small 16 oz glass not a std 20 oz glass. I questioned the waitress who was no help, the Manager explained that they do both sizes of domestic all though where I come from a pint is 20 oz not 16.  It is misleading and not correct and the prices are not reflective of a smaller size glass. Beware when ordering your pint."}
{"text":"We went to the Toad N Turtle on New Years ever and it was fairly busy but we started out with really great service. It did get a little slower and less great though as we were there longer.   Our waitress forgot about us a few times and so it took about 30 mins to even get wings ordered and then the draft beer we had was very flat so we asked for bottles and 10 mins later she brought more draft beers???  so we then asked again for bottles as the second set was flat as well.  over 30 mins later we finally got our beer. Our wings and dinner were amazing!  Brisket is done right there (if you take off the cabbage) Our service got better just before we left but food was good so hoping it was a 1 time thing. I would recommend TnT but maybe not their draft."}
{"text":"Best resturant stew i have ever tasted. Its a boof bourguignon but lamb. OMG. Bringing family back for supper soon."}
{"text":"Awesome service.  We started out upstairs on the patio but found the menu was a bit limited so we moved downstairs.  The service was just as awesome and friendly downstairs as it was up.   The pizza & wings we ordered were great.  After we finished eating we didn't feel rushed or pressured to leave and the staff was still just as friendly as if we had just walked in.  Nice selection of smaller brewery offerings too."}
{"text":"Great pub food, a good variety and always good service. I like that they have a range of appetizers-the traditional stuff as well as mini versions of favourite pub entrees. Most stuff is reasonably priced although the steak sandwich was pricey by a few bucks for what it was. We also missed getting our gravy. A little thing though.  Location is great and the place is huge so even on a game night I would imagine there is ample space. I've been here before with a group and their patio is very nice on a summer nice. Inside the regular seating area it's pretty dark but it adds to the ambiance.  If I'm in the area it would be a top choice but its not quite the place you'd drive across town for."}
{"text":"Great food. We started with the beef yorkie. FANTASTIC. I had the butter chicken and it was better than most Idian restaurants.  I was also with a business associate and he had the Ruban sandwich. He said it was great and recommended it to his friend who arrived after we finished eating.  As the place got busier, the service started to decline. This location only has bar top tables inside.  There is two patios. One on the ground floor and one on the roof. I hear the upstairs patio has a limited menu.  Overall, we agreed that we would return again."}
{"text":"I'd give them no stars if I could.  I have a food allergy, one that can be lethal to me (depending on how much I consume).  As a result, I try not to eat out much, as it's always a risk.  By far one of the worst experiences I've had in the way a restaurant has managed my allergy.  The waitress, although slow, made a couple of trips to the kitchen to see what would work best.  As far as I can see, she did her best to take care of me.   Partway through my meal, I felt the telltale itching in my throat, and pulled aside the server.  I had identified what I thought might be the source of my allergen, and she headed to the kitchen, saying she'd confirm.    Five minutes later, she was serving drinks to other patrons, and still hadn't swung by. Another five minutes after that, she came back, confirming they'd contaminated my food and asking if I wanted anything else.   And risk them making things worse?  No.   The assistant general manager then stopped by the table.  He had a very 'so what' attitude, tried to blame the waitress, and said that the kitchen had not been made aware of my allergy.  He did not at any point ask if I was okay or express any concern about my well-being.  So I'm at home, covered in hives, and displeased with the way my Friday has gone.  If you have a food allergy, do your best to keep away."}
{"text":"The Toad 'n' Turtle toadally exceeded my expectations. My husband and I went for happy hour/early dinner. I started off with a bloody Caesar. It was tangy and refreshing with a nice kick. I really liked the horseradish in it.   We both ordered off the appetizer menu. I chose the five mini yorkies which boasted a large portion. My husband had the hot wings which were supposed to be a full pound. As a native of Louisiana, he chose the hottest sauce - Suicide.   We enjoyed the pub atmosphere and were able to watch the Texas Rangers on one of the many TVs while we waited for our food.   I was pleasantly surprised by the size of my appetizer. The five \"mini\" yorkies spilled over the edge of the plate. They were piping hot traditional Yorkshire puddings stuffed with roast beef and topped with brown gravy. Just a dollop, not too much. The yorkies were also served with au jus and a creamy horseradish sauce to dip. The puddings were fluffy and doughy with the texture of a beignet.   My husband's meal was the Yin to my Yang in size. What was supposed to be a \"full pound of meaty wings\" was actually only eight regular size wings. Which was way to small for $13. He said the wings had a nice flavor, almost Asian, rather than buffalo. They were spicy enough. Fortunately, my portion was shareable so we both left satisfied.   I will go back to the Toad 'n' Turtle for the mini yorkies alone!"}
{"text":"When its good, its very good. Sometimes can be a little hit & miss on the service side of things. Patio is nice.  Wifi is good.  A nice place for adults to relax and socialize.  (This is a pub and does not admit minors)"}
{"text":"Interesting pub in the hotel convention centre district.  So a lot of suits mixed in with the baseball caps.  High ceilings and tv's and good pub decorations.  Not a big place.  Lamb stew was excellent.  So they know how to cook!  Reasonable prices.  And they have beer specials. But pints only 16oz.   Pints keep shrinking...hard to find 18 and 20oz anymore.  A good place to kill time."}
{"text":"Great wings, good specials on beer, fast friendly service, nice patio.      All I need in a pub!"}
{"text":"The menu had promise online, so without further thought on \"where should we dine\" we got in the car and drove ourselves to TNT.   I didn't like the interior much and the other ambience aspects weren't great either. We sat at a high table and waited for service (was probably in the 10 minute mark) which wouldn't have been so bad if we had menus. When our server did come over she asked what we wanted... and I politely said \"menus?\" this seemed to make her annoyed.   When it came down to ordering food, we got the veggie cocktail, calamari and the pulled pork poutine. The veggie platter and calamari were both not what I expected. Calamari was rubbery and greasy. Veggies came in an actual plastic cocktail glass from a dollar store - I don't know what they are going for there but it isn't working.   The poutine was good but very, very salty and we just couldn't finish it. All in all, I think there are much better places to go in Calgary and will not be going back, unless it's not by choice."}
{"text":"Did a search on Google for the \"Best Chicken Wings In Calgary\". And guess what? Toad and Turtle. I live downtown, so this AIN'T convenient but, Hell, you have to fly somewhere to see the Mona Lisa, so suck it up, Buttercup. First of all we sat there for quite some time before heaven sent us an ANGEL. Jennifer. You can drivel on with the most boring story in the world. She's THERE for you. She was busy as it gets, but she'll never let you know. Treats you like the only table she's had for a week. After we're Married.... Got the COOLEST curly red hair, and a way about her that's just terrific. She's great for recommends and wonderful as a server.  OK on to the food. Lately I'm finding servers who don't feel 'entitled' and, instead, treat what they DO like a thing to be proud of. Yo, Jennifer!  Now the wings. You'll walk out with a whole new impression of the lowly assed chicken wing. Instead of over fried, stringy meat, 9 cent wings? These guys are ALL 2-3 bite wings. Succulent, Juicy and full of flavour.  I love Suicide wings, bless their black little, chili covered souls. These were perfect if you're sharing, because they DO them right. How many times have you had suicide wings that barely graded hot? Almost every time. These were pleasantly difficult to finish the ten of. Next time I'd split an order. We had Garlic-Parmesan, Cranberry-Lime and Suicide. 30 wings between me and a Chicklet friend. Left 5 on the last plate. You will understand why they're rated the best in town. Now, stack 30 wings on Jennifer's watch? A trip to remember. Here's a little tip... wing nite is WED. *But these guys take reservations! Do it, do it, do it....."}
{"text":"This is a great pub for casual dinner/drinks. They have a good selection of draft beers, lots of different flavors for wings, and other standard bar fare (burgers, sandwiches, pizza, etc).  We got the Edmontonian, chili garlic wings, honey garlic wings, and poutine. Mmm, everything was delicious.  Prices are pretty reasonable and service was great. They have plenty of TVs to watch sports/news while you eat.  We were staying at the nearby Travelodge and wanted to grab dinner in the area since we had to return our rental car to the airport later that night. There are several other hotels in the area, but not too much other than car dealerships, a Costco, and some other random shops. If you're staying at Travelodge, you could walk here as it's really that close."}
{"text":"The food was good, lobster roll lacked flavour the pulled pork kettle chips was good, should come with a dipping sauce...They have one of the best tasting bacon caesar cocktails i have ever had! My friend ordered a caesar salad and found a long blond hair in it, also lack of dressing. We sent it back."}
{"text":"Great Pub!  The atmosphere was fun and the food was really good.  They make most of their own sauces and dressings, as all as other delights on the menu.  The staff was friendly and  attentive.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"The Toad & Turtle is a good pub over in the NE. There is lots of space, it occasionally gets busy but there are so many tables you can always get a seat.  My favourite part of the Toad & Turtle is the chicken wings. They are quite good. Lots of selection, my favourite is the sweet chili garlic or the buffalo cesar. They are large wings, and very juicy. And on Wednesday they are on sale!  I choose it over lots of other pubs in the NE."}
{"text":"Walked into the Toad N Turtle just due to the convenient location of where we needed to be and needing to kill an hour's time. The rush of the noise from the bar when you walk through the front door is crazy on a Friday night after normal working hours! Was not too surprising as the parking lot was packed! We opted for the dining room where it was a tad quieter to have a couple of drinks and a snack. We seemed to won the 'unfriendly waitress of the day' award who seemed to simply hate her life... she advised that she does not eat greasy, fried pub food when we asked about the menu and could not really steer us in any direction food-wise. Oh boy! We winged it with a shared quesadilla. Not the worst we have ever had - the corn and beans inside was a nice touch but skimpy for $13. The drinks were just ok.  The clean pub and decent washrooms brought this place to 3 stars rather than a sad 2 star. 1 star for the service on this occasion, will not be rushing back."}
{"text":"Walked over here from my hotel tonight.  I had an ice tea and a Spuloma burger.  Apparently that is a spicy sausage known here in Alberta.  Quite tasty and not overly spicy.  It came with kettle chips (thinly sliced russet potatoes, flash fried).  The chips were just alright, a little over done unfortunately so they lost alot of their flavor.   The burger was good though! Quick service, friendly staff."}
{"text":"It's pub food and football! No worries watching your favorite NFL team here!!  Great game day atmosphere. Good food cold beer. You get it!"}
{"text":"Excellent upstairs patio! It's a whole different atmosphere than downstairs, with its own tropical beach theme. Plenty of seating too!  The drink menu is different than downstairs, with a few select drafts and bottles. They have a lot of tropical inspired cocktails such as the 'Turtle's Got Blue Balls' (2oz for $9.50) with mango juice, blue curacao, and creme de banana topped with two \"blueberries\".. get it? haha...   The cocktail was really watery, definitely not worth the $9.50, but it was on sale for $7 on Thursday so it wasn't too bad.  My bf and I also tried their $10 special of half an order of 'Pulled Pork Nachos' which were wickedly awesome! Enough for two people (who haven't eaten yet); a full size would be enough for 4 people. I was surprised to see that they did not skimp on the amount of pulled pork that was nicely smoked, lightly sauced, wasn't overly sweet, and moist. There was also a good amount of toppings (olives, jalapenos, banana peppers, and tomatoes) - I hate it when there is a mound of plain chips leftover. It could have used a bit more cheese, but overall I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this place, I have been going for 12 years since I was old enough to go.  I would recommend this for anyone up for some random pub food or a patio beer!"}
{"text":"We've had good and bad experiences there.Food can be good, or be so so. We loved their turkey putin. Too bad they don't serve it all the time.We were very disappointed not to be able to get french fries on the deck one summer evening. the service is always good though."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch recently with a group from work. I am not really a pub person, but have to say how enjoyable the experience was.  The restaurant is divided into 2 distinct sides. When entering to your left is the pub. High ceilings, tall cocktail style tables, long bar and lots of pub decor.  As we had a large group we were seated in the restaurant side, located on the right hand side of the establishment. It too, was \"pubby\" but with more of a restaurant feel.  OK.. so here are my thoughts.  The staff were exceptional, our waitress handled our larger party with ease, she was friendly, accommodating and had no problem when our large party grew even bigger by adding another table.  I was wanting a vegetarian option and as they didn't really have anything specific, I opted for fries and a bacon free Caesar salad.  Considering we had a party of close to 20 people, the food-service was fairly quick and all of our food was excellent.  Caesar salad was delicious, a bit too garlicky for me, but most people would love it. The fries were great too, ( just fries) but remarkably tasty! All of the staff that served us were so friendly, and the lunch was relaxed, fun and we felt like welcome guests. Did I mention the free wifi and plentiful parking out front? Originally I was going to score this a 4, but thought, hey it doesn't get any better than this.  I will be back again."}
{"text":"Really disappointed this time our server was not happy @ all. Mostly because she was responsible for tooooo many tables and was just trying to keep up. The food seemed not very fresh. The grey coloured coleslaw was kind of off putting just like the flavour. Not sure I would return."}
{"text":"They have have a small and simple menu of beer selections. But I kinda like it, the choice is broad enough to cover what you feel like having. This day I went with an espresso stout.  I always loved their food menu at Toad N Turtle. They have a few original dishes and they do pub classics really well. If you order half-nachos you still get enough nachos to make you regret why you ate what you ate and have to be a guurl and work those buns off af the elliptical machine. They also have a TURKEY poutine, I'll let you envision the possibilities of that wonder.  Anyways for a pub that doesn't care to call itself a \"gastropub\" I like Toad N Turtle. I just wished it didn't exist the other side of the city for me otherwise I'd make it a point to drag friends into this place every weekend."}
{"text":"Almost room temperature beer , grouchy service average food.  Will never bring the guys here again.  Really nice interior though."}
{"text":"The toad and turtle sucks food sucks staff sucks , beer sucks service was terrible on the roof top patio never went back again , the toad is a breeding ground for morons"}
{"text":"We had a community event recently to watch the Super Bowl there and the location was a good choice. I especially liked the layout with all the screens conveniently located and visible from everywhere. While nothing was particularly unique about the pub, there was nothing noticeably wrong with it either. The service and food were good and reasonably priced. While the place is not deficient in any obvious way, I have not had any \"wow\" moments on my first visit.  Verdict: This is a pub you want to go to get drunk. It does the job, and does it well. What it lacks is flavor and uniqueness."}
{"text":"We love coming to Toad & Turtle!  Their wing nights are great - so many flavours to choose from!  And sometimes we just don't feel like cooking and will come for 2-for-1 appetizer nights.  Their beer and wine selection is great.  Fast and friendly service, and a laid back atmosphere.  Definitely a great local pub!"}
{"text":"Excellent spot for dinner !!  Nice friendly staff great food :) The coconut shrimp and butter chicken are EXCELLENT !!  You can tell they use GOOD ingredients and not just frozen crap.  The food was fresh and very nicely done :)   I will be back !"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times. their Shepard's pie is pretty good. I recommend their Yorkshire puddings. Well trained bar tenders from what I saw. I asked for a apple martini and the bar tender asked what kind. I asked what kind can he make and he started listing varieties. So he's quite knowledgable.   I recommend coming here for pub food."}
{"text":"Second time here and hit specials each time. On Wednesday it's wing specials and Thursday it's 2 for 1 appetizers and cocktails. Good beer selections and bartenders that really know how to make drinks. Plenty of TVs and a good after work vibe. I will be back for sure the next time I am near."}
{"text":"Very poor service from the wait staff. Took 10 minutes to take a beverage order. Took another 15 to get my food order in and it was not very busy for a Tuesday at 6pm.   Ordered the steak sandwich with the artesian salad.   Salad very good but small. Steak sandwich was cooked well but a very small 7oz and extremely chewy. Not AAA steak that I have ever had before and I have cooked lots and lots of steak both as a job and personally. Not impressed hence the 2 star rating. Many better choices out there for comparable money."}
{"text":"I found the turtle but could not see the toad any were. Maybe Ill look for him next time   fun place a little noisy but that I guess should be expected when its game night. I was actually expecting to play a game of pool but they don't have a table. Good thing the food was decent beer was cold and I had good company and conversations to pass the time."}
{"text":"Usually the food and service is much better but tonight it was pretty lack luster. The pizza wasn't that hot and seemed slightly over cooked and our server really needs to know what providing exceptional service is.....it seemed tonight that she couldn't give two shits that she was working. Not sure if I'll return based on this visit. Major improvement needed here."}
{"text":"Awesome chicken wings.  Just don't over order on wing night ...."}
{"text":"The brunch options here are great. I've been here a few times now and have never been disappointed. The breakfast poutine is a large portion and the hashbrowns are always nice and crispy. This is probably the best option for brunch in the shopping centre as there is no line so you're not waiting 20 minutes to sit down to eat a mediocre crepe at Cora's.  Since they've opened the service has continued to improve."}
{"text":"This is a two level building with a patio upstairs and and area down below. They have different menus for each level.   Ate down stairs and got the Poutine with pulled pork. It was awesome! Huge portions and very good taste.   If I ever come to Calgary again I'm for sure stopping by."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a while now , an the wings are great on Wednesday evening . An the staff is very attentive . An music just loud enough that you can hear who you with talk . An their Sunday meals are excellent"}
{"text":"Surprised on a Monday the kitchen would close at 10. We had a group of 35-40 people in for a meeting and were surprised that no food was available after. Such a shame. Earls helped us out."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place, and have been coming here regularly for NFL and a just good night out. But as of late the food quality has drastically gone down hill. Which is a shame. The prices have gone up, which in the beginning wasn't a problem because the food was still amazing. But my last few experiences have left me wondering if it's worth coming back. The cocktails are always great, the bartenders are very skilled. But who is allowing burnt Maui ribs to come out of the kitchen?! If it was my first time having them, I'd probably never return.. Or if I did, I'd never order them again."}
{"text":"This was the worse food ever the appetizer was cold, should of been hot.could not chew the meat.  We did inform the server, but she did not have a good understanding of english.  We did get a small discount, but really, we should of not paid.  We left most of the food. Terrible food."}
{"text":"Nice little stop in bar and restaurant. Brisket wrap was excellent. Nice patio sitting with a smaller menu. Great specials every night."}
{"text":"What an awesome deck. The food was really good and service was fast. Very pleasant staff and a great place for lunch. One had brisket the other turkey wrap with home made potato salad. DELICIOUS....can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"love the atmosphere, however, the food was just okay. I am visiting from Houston. Because of the hubby's career, we come here twice a year. I will probably not visit the restaurant again..."}
{"text":"We opted to eat on the upper patio, in the outdoor air.  The food was great.  The wine was superb.  The staff was friendly.  The only downside is a smaller menu than in the regular dining room.  Some of the menu items are not served on the upper deck."}
{"text":"If you've been around NE Calgary for any length of time, you've likely been to The Toad. It's a standalone building just off Barlow Trail and 27th Ave. If you're exiting off Barlow, you'll need to do a couple of extra turns to get yourself into the parking lot since the only entrance is off 27th Ave itself or through the Hooters parking lot.  There's a decent selection of beer. Extra points for carrying some local brews like Village Blacksmith. An also extra points for still having the Edmontonian on the menu. I had eaten this YEARS ago and before we headed over wondered if it was still on the menu. Lo and behold... it was! But I think they made it better. Two bratwurst sausages, a pile of perogies smothered in sauerkraut and bacon bits and some sour cream and dijon mustard on the side for $14.95. Holy toledo, Yelpman, did that meal ever fill me up. I'm afraid with the beer it was a bit too much carb goodness for one afternoon!   Anyway, the upstairs patio remains a warmer weather favourite and the big, free parking lot is always a nice change from fighting for spaces downtown."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today as I have heard so much about this place.  Can't say that I can comment on the food as we never got that far.  We sat down and waited and waited....finally got menus and ordered water.  We waited again and finally got the water.  Our menus were closed as we had had lots of time to decide but the waitress just put the water on the table and walked away.  After waiting again and having made eye contact with the waitress 3 times but she didn't come by we got up and left. We won't bother with this place again."}
{"text":"Four stars because they have the best specials and pub food in the area.  Their competition attempts to be higher end, but read the reviews, your paying extra for ambiance and little else. Last night the wings were great and we had had to split the Edmontonian, a stick to your ribs bratwurst and pierogi plate.  A huge casual space with pub style comfort food and always a happy hour!"}
{"text":"I love Toad and Turtle.  Maybe five stars is a bit too much, TnT is not \"exquisite\", but still very good.  Friendly service, solid menu, small but nice collection of beers, lots of parking space in front, inexpensive - what else to ask from a restaurantish bar (or barish restaurant)?  Been there lots of times, always happy, never a serious issue.  Well, nitpicking, it would be nice to have more beers to choose from. And more plates on the menu. But quality and comfort help a lot - Toad and Turtle is my choice, when around the area."}
{"text":"We came here for wings night which is honestly frighteningly cheap, I think. At $0.40/wing you have to wonder what kind of conditions chickens are forced to undergo their super speed growth in order to provide us with 40 cent wings. But who cares because tasty chicken! Unfortunately I could not eat any wings but I will note that the wings do not come with celery sticks (much to my dismay) nor do they come with ranch dressing (much to the dismay of my friends). Since I'm basically just a mouthpiece for my meat eating friends here, according to them the flavours that were good: hot teriyaki, hot, and salt and pepper. Not so great: suicide. We also got onion rings, which I did eat and I think they were nice. Not too oily or heavily battered. I have had their veggie burger before (not at this location) and I think it may be one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had. Overall, a great place to hang out and grab a bite in the evenings whether or not you eat meat!  Recently came here and ordered the veggie burger again but I think they've changed their recipe and it's more dry than I remember it. Still not bad but certainly not the best I've ever had, which is unfortunate."}
{"text":"I've been hopping into Toad N Turtle for years now. See what I did there? Okay, I'm done with the puns, maybe.   Toad has amazing, AMAZING, daily specials. Like 2 for 1 appetizers on Sundays or Wing Night Wednesdays. Which is hands-down the best wings in the city. On Wednesdays is when I normally go, and be forewarned that it can/does get super busy. However, no matter how busy they are the staff is always so pleasant and helpful.   There are 23 regular flavours of chicken wings and a weekly flavour too! I think I've tried all of them over the past years, okay months, and my favourite is medium-ranch and dill-pickle. The wings are gigantic, one basket is very filling but it's on wing night, one basket is not an option! Wings are $4.00 a basket and you are required to buy a drink.  The Toad has a bunch of fun cocktails and tons of beers and ales too. I love the Bullfrogs, it's essentially two drinks in one. A frozen margarita with a bottle of Corona in it. So delish, I highly recommend it. It is the perfect drink for the perfect diet cheat day.   I'm not really a pub person, but I really enjoy the Toad. It is decorated in an English theme. I love the red phone booth and the mini knight at the front of the pub. They even have soccer matches on during the soccer season too. They also have food specials on game night, for the Canadian hockey fans too!  I just found out about their Toadly Hungover Breakfast Special, note to self: after my next bender, we have a place to recover.    I really like how responsible the owners of TNT are. I noticed a sign in the bathroom that said, \"complimentary mocktails will be offered to expecting mothers and designated drivers.\" And there is signage throughout the pub for safe travels home via Plan B (a DD service) and even discounted pricing for nearby hotels, if you can't commute home."}
{"text":"Great place to try Poutine for the first time! Typical pub food. Would have loved to have tried the wings but I was too full. Wing night is Wednesday 40 cent wings!"}
{"text":"When you first step into this pub you are greeted with noise from the people sitting in the pub and the tvs showing the latest hockey game or another sport if there isn't any hockey.  Most nights I'm guessing they have a game on.  Since we wanted to chat during our meal, we decided to sit in the restaurant area which is much quieter.  They still have tvs with sports on them but they also have booths and tables with chairs for more comfortable seating than the high pub chairs.  It was pretty quiet with one other table so if you are looking to get away from the noise, but still watch to catch a game, sit on this side.  The menu consists of a variety of wraps, sandwiches, and pizzas, the usual pub food.  I decided to have the pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries. The fries were abundant and I liked the thicker cut.  The sandwich was served on a bun that was a bit chewier than my liking but there was a good amount of pork and it was tender and juicy and topped off with lettuce.  Half the sandwich and fries was enough for a hearty meal.    The service was fine, food was decent and atmosphere was alright.  It didn't really 'wow' me but if you are in the area, you would likely enjoy your meal here.  If you are a beer and sports fan, you would likely really enjoy it."}
{"text":"Can here for dinner with a friend for dinner.   Got an appie. Ribs. they came out fast and are awesome.   Our dinner (two club sandwiches) took over 25 minutes. Finally our waitress came over and told us they would be out in two minutes.... then four minutes. ...  .... ...  ten minutes later. Still now sandwiches! No sign of the server. She finally showed up. Apologized for the wait. And the sandwiches were.... ok. Not amazing though."}
{"text":"I had eaten at the TnT in the north many times.  I often thought of them as one of the original good food pubs, they always have a great patio feel too. We walked into the mackenzie location On a sunny Saturday afternoon and the place was dead.  No one even said hello. We were going to head up to the patio and were promptly told it was not open.  Ok still I had not given up because I've always had a great meal in the north.  So you can imagine how disappointed I was when the food was awful at the mackenzie location.  I was so in the mood for fish and chips but when I asked the waitress how they were she said \" I wouldn't order them\" well that took that craving away fast.  We ordered The Maui rib off the appie menu, it tasted burnt and the flavour was mediocre.  We had the \"stacked\" pastrami sandwich with broccoli slaw.  Stacked was a gross understatement, gently layered would have better described it.  You could not even taste the mustard, which made the sandwich blah.  The broccoli slaw was down right awful, we actually sent it back.  It tasted old and woody.   Super disappointed. With so many choices I would be hard pressed to find a reason to go back."}
{"text":"It's just ok, basic pub flare.   The pizzas were actually pretty good.  The nachos were a fail thou.  I just never understood how a pub could not get nachos right, it's a very easy dish that requires minimal imagination or skill.  The service staff was attentive but not many people there.  They had a 25oz beer special in large mugs, that was cool"}
{"text":"This is a good place to have a drink after working, if you work close to that area. I wouldn't drive there only to go to this place, but if you are around, you can stop by and have a drink. The drinks in the patio are great!!.. And the service is good!!.. The view is nice if the day is sunny!.."}
{"text":"If I could rank lower then 1 star I would. Terrible service, terrible food. Don't eat here unless you want to be tied to your toilet for 2 days afterward.   Shrimp tacos - NO. Greasy (how?!), doused in mayo Beef stroganoff- basically dog food warmed up on noodles  Will NOT be back."}
{"text":"We loved this place! A ton of beers on tap with a fantastic bartender. Bret asked us what kind of beers we liked, gave us samples then and switched it up all night. We drank several different beers we wouldn't have normally tried and they were delicious. The wings were great; meaty with tasty sauce.  Later, the manager, Ryan, came over chatted us up and gave us some tourist information. Super friendly. Great place!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch while in Calgary for the day and overall had a good experience. It's your standard pub and has lots of seating. They've got a good menu and the food and drinks are decent and the service is friendly. I'd say that OJ's has a better beef dip, but really, who can beat OJ's beef dip.... NOBODY. All in all, definitely try this place out if you're in the area."}
