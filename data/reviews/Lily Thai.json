{"text":"Really great food! I love the mango salad,  coconut rice and their thick peanut sauce with chicken. The restaurant is very nice and the service is great. The food always is fresh and nicely plated. The grilled asparagus in season is a must - try.  Also great place for takeout."}
{"text":"Man... One bad server can totally wreck a otherwise great restaurant.   My wife and I live in Markham and make the effort to go to Lily Thai whenever we are in the west end.  Food is great and the service is usually good. Except today. The waitress mistook/misheard our order and gave us Golden vegetable curry instead of chicken.  When we told her we ordered chicken she insisted we didn't. The customer is always right! Worse yet,  the cook just picked out the veggies and put chicken in the same bowl.  And when the waitress brought it back, she exclaimed \"now there is chicken in it!\" When we addressed it with her after the meal her responses were \"I'm not stupid.  I know what I heard\", \"I don't give a f*** it's my last day\", and \"you ate it before calling me\" it's curry, we started scooping from the top of the bowl before realizing it was all veggie. Sandra's attitude in dealing with the situation was unacceptable.  Hope she changes or never works in the customer service industry again. The manager over the phone seemed understanding.  Unfortunately not enough for us to come back... Shame. We really liked you Lily Thai."}
{"text":"I have been to both the Lily Thai in Georgetown and this one in Brampton. His one is a little more flavourful. Decent Thai. I wish they used the authentic wide rice noodles but it's really hard to find places that do. They are pretty good at accommodating large groups and fast times. We have come as a staff for fast lunches or dinners and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I recently found this place and decided to go. I got the green curry with vegetables and tofu, it was delicious oh my goodness! The prices are reasonable for the portion sizes and the food is so hot and fresh. I brought along my parents and they were greatly pleased as well :) The service is great they are very kind and calm people. The restaurant itself is gorgeous, the decor is beautiful; which in my opinion always helps with a dining experience. Back to the food because I can't stopping thinking about it lol.. seriously, after I was done my meal I was smiling because the flavours of my dish were so deep in flavour, nothing was bland. I would definitely go again, I love to try new dishes but the green curry is so good it's gonna be hard for me to try anything else."}
{"text":"Ordered the green curry with rice. Honestly, the green curry was really good but their portion was very small. The order came to $16.00. It's very expensive compared to restaurants. The food wasn't the problem. It was the price and the portion.   I wouldn't eat here again if I'm trying to save money."}
{"text":"I'm so glad this place is nearby to my home!  Seems pricey but the portions are BIG.  I could have at least 3 meals when I order from Lily Thai.  I've only had the take out, but the restaurant is decorated nicely and is clean.  Be sure to get the Drunken Noodles with chicken....delicious!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is in a plaza behind Tim Hortons. So gets a lot of traffic. I absolutely recommend going here for lunch or dinner.  They serve halal chicken as well.  The peanut Thai curry was to die for.  There curry sauce is truly creamy and delicious.  I had it with the coconut rice and I was in heaven.   However I find the prices to be steep and service was slow both times.  Decor was excellent and clean"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of the meal. That's rare when eating out. That coconut sticky rice was so good.  Love that this place is so close to me, this is definitely my wife and I's go-to for Thai food now."}
{"text":"Being a big fan of thai , decided to try out this place. I ordered Chicken satay, Chicken green curry, coconut sticky rice and stir fry noodles . The food is pretty bland and satay was basically a fried chicken with not much taste.  I've had many green curries but this was average and not appealing to my taste buds. The place is pricey but doesn't hurt if you come out satisfied! Cost for 2 : $55 Will go back go? : Not really!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is in an unassuming strip mall across from Mt. Pleasant go station. Really nice interior, great for a date night. Pricing is quite reasonable, and they have a great lunch menu too. LUNCH will run you a little over 10$ and dinner about 20-30$ depending (including drinks). You can eat family style or individually. The waitress I had there was knowledgeable and gave good suggestions.  The food was bang on (meaning it was good, and what I thought it would be). Really enjoyed it, as it tasted fresh, and felt I got my $ worth.  This isn't some fancy fusion joint if you are looking to push your palette. This is a I want decent Thai food at a decent price with a fresh designed interior."}
{"text":"Until recently, I'd always gone to Bamboo Garden (now Pho Kennedy) for my Thai food in Brampton. The decor there was hilariously bad and they didn't seem to ever have heat and so you would freeze while you ate but it was delicious, cheap, and surprisingly large portions considering the price.  I've now found those last 3 things WITH heat and a restaurant with a really nice vibe! I mean, they even have tablecloths! I don't know how Lily Thai does it, but they manage to have a very tasty and very affordable menu in a joint that looks much classier than we deserve for the price.   I've only been once so far but I can pretty confidently say this will be my new go-to restaurant for thai food in Brampton, even if it is a tiny bit farther from home."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying this restaurant despite passing by it a few times. Don't let the busy exterior  distract you, when you walk in you will be taken aback by the cozy vibe and simplistic decor and low light ambiance.  We ordered lemongrass saut√© chicken with a side of jasmine rice and Thai fresh mango rolls.  The food was served within 10 minutes of us ordering it and tasted fresh and very flavourful! I will definitely  be back here to try more :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant was such a great find. From the intimate decor to the food bursting with flavor, I couldn't believe it!  I first ordered the pumpkin soup and let me tell you, I was expecting a small bowl but nope, it was served in a very big bowl and was a perfect sized portion for days when you need something warm.  I then ordered the red seafood curry. My mouth couldn't believe what it was tasting. There was an abundance of flavor in everything! Every single piece of seafood was complemented by the savoriness and subtle sweetness of the curry while my favorite part was the mussels bursting with the broth while you bit into them.  This is one of those places you really want to keep going back to. They didn't have some of the items I requested, but their curry game is really on point. If you really want amazing Thai food, I would hands down recommend coming here! You can thank me later!"}
{"text":"More like 3.5 for service and 3 for food Ordered spring rolls with tiger shrimps and they had only one small shrimp in each roll! Definitely not worth the price!! Service was nice and friendly, food nothing special, tasted more like fast food Thai rather than what you expect from a restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and came in really good (read: large) portions. Great atmosphere and the interior was amazing.  Wasn't too thrilled with the coconut soup but still tasty."}
{"text":"I love thai ... I have tried so many good thai resturants.. but this to me was the worse ever.  There are many good thai resturants in toronto or GTA area .... I want to tell about my taste so that we can compare  Jatujak : is a small dinning place but worth a penny. I like the food there.  Khao San road : closed now but was lovely.  Pai: really good.  So now I am sure u got to know my taste.   They should definetly improve.    Watch the video P.S"}
{"text":"Great food but seriously understaffed there was only one waitress and she took forever to come take our order."}
{"text":"What a great find!! Thanks to fellow Yelpers for writing their reviews. Once again, Yelpers have steered me right.  Got here today for lunch for my very first time, with my mother in law. We both had the mango salad, but of course I had to add the hot and sour soup. Phenomenal way to start the lunch special!! The mother in law had South Thai Chicken Fried Rice and I had the Spicy Basil Fried Rice with Beef. I was lucky to get to try some of the mother in laws lunch and that, as well as mine was absolutely outstanding!! The portions are huge and the pricing is definitely in line with what I assumed it was!! I will surely be back here with a much bigger part of my family real soon!!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine wanted to try this place for a while. It was not bad. Probably the best Thai place in Brampton. All the food was a bit to sweet. It had a good flavour if the food was not so sweet. The service was really good, and it had alot of people coming there. They were under staff and yet the provided good service. The waitress was very engaging in recommending food choices. The prices were a bit to bight for the food. Regarding the food: Don't get the Tom yum soup. Not the best. The pumpkin curry soup was good. The party platter was very good. The satay skews were very good. The Thai basil rice was spicy and flavourful. The Lamb was not worth the price. Stay away. I will come again and try some other selections."}
{"text":"I would go back here again.   I got the house pad thai, a bit spicy, but not overpowering. I have a medium to mild tolerance for heat, so to me, it was just the right amount.   The service was pretty quick, with an attentive server. The plate was full, I didn't even finish it. I got the meal, which came with Tom Yum soup to wet your appetite, as well as veggie spring rolls.   It was my first time there and I would come back to it again."}
{"text":"Not to shabby considering where in Brampton It is!  Prices were ok, about 12 dollars.  The drink specials though were great, 5 dollars for a tiger beer!! You cannot go wrong!  I went with the basic chicken Pad Thai to judge this place.  If they can't make a pad thai, then what's the point of trying others?  The portions was huge. the taste was there....except I could have had it a bit spicier....the 2 chilli warning was more like one chilli!  but oh well.  It is small but very nice on the inside...not like some other thai places.  Service was top notch.  I will be updating when I try other dishes, but so far I would go back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday for lunch just after opening (3pm) and there was only one other table there.  My friend and I both ordered the chicken pad thai.  The serving is HUGE.  My guy friend couldn't even finish it and it was his first meal of the day..and he can eat a lot lol.  I got the rest of mine to go and my leftovers filled up a whole large take out container.  It was as if I ordered a whole meal to go.  The pad thai itself was just ok.  The noodles were really chewy and hard to chew off, if you get what I mean.  The flavour was okay but I've had better.  I may return, I may not.  I've already tried the yellow curry here previously and it was nothing special.  Yellow curry and pad thai are my go to dishes, so I wouldn't really be interested in trying anything else here.  Service was really good though. Our server kept refilling our water without us having to ask."}
{"text":"This location is good but the prices are slightly higher than the Acton location for the same menu. I also find the Acton location has fresher ingredients but maybe that is in my head?  If I didn't have a comparison point, this is still a great location to go to if you don't want to leave Brampton."}
{"text":"Food wasn't impressive, and the price was high for the quality and portion they were serving. I ordered the Tamarin Duck for $22 and it didn't even come with rice. Had to order a bowl of rice because the duck was too saucy to be eaten on its own. The duck tasted like ham with BBQ sauce on it. Very disappointing. My husband ordered pad thai and he said that Thai Express tasted better. My brother ordered curry and he said it was just ok. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Based on what we ordered we would say this restaurant is very good. We tried the Acton location however the Brampton one was MUCH better. We order the green curry (chicken) and the pad thai. Both excellent and very flavourful dishes. Friendly waitress as well."}
{"text":"I am a Thai lover and place was a big disappointment and if you consider the price it is even a bigger disappointment. The ambience is like a fine dining & so are the prices but the food is not even worth 2 stars. Thai Iced Tea was watered and tasteless. A contrast of an actual Thai iced tea is like.  Any of the dishes except 3 curries do not come with rice. the price ranges from 12-17$ each.  My Thai curry was thin like water and all I could taste was sugar in Greem curry. The chicken stir-fry that we ordered had some pieces of chicken and tasted plain. The quantity of food was good but the food was not something I would visit them again ever.  Service was poor too."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the food. I doubt I would go back here. It just didn't satisfy. Food was fresh and prepared in a timely matter. There was plenty of parking in the rear."}
{"text":"The mango salad is a must have! We also got the house special - general Tao chicken. One of the best I've ever got. Will go back!"}
{"text":"Great food! Have tried different dishes every time and every single thing we've ordered has been fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Lily's is one of my favourite places for beef Pad Thai. Their house Pad Thai is delicious will a bit of lime citrus. I have come here a number of times, and always have the pad thai it's that good! I also really enjoy the Shanghai noodles, they are a bit more spicy but equally good and come with chicken and shrimp. I've had the won ton soup, which is good but I wish the chucks of mushrooms were cooked more. Service is always very quick and the staff is very polite and accommodating. I would highly recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night, met a hostess there who was extremely salty. Odd that they have Chinese food, but it was good. The Hostess was obsessed with adding salt on our plates, not sure why... I was interested in the Thai food but kept getting Chinese food on our plates. Not sure why that is either... The owner was a good gal though. love that chick. Little chef was a nice guy. Again, all Chinese... Why not just rename it Lily China to begin with. To be honest, it was very, very Chinese 5/5.  By the way I might have been high and/or drunk at the time, not sure if it was Lily Thai I actually went to or a Chinese place."}
{"text":"Great restaurant for both eating in and take out. The smoked duck curry is very tasty."}
{"text":"Good authentic Thai food. Had soup, mango salad and green curry. Totally satisfied with quality of food."}
{"text":"I would of given them 5 stars but because I found the shrimp coconut soup way to sweet, it had to lose a star.. I enjoyed the green curry chicken it was really flavorful a bit more so on the spicy side but still tasted really good. The Mango salad is Amazing and the chicken spring rolls are really good, I like the sauce that came with it too. The coconut rice and the glass noodles taste really good and fresh! Definitely coming here again! I recommend."}
{"text":"Located in a little strip mall. You wouldn't suspect the interior would be so nice and romantic. Myself and my coworker decided on this place for dinner. There was only one other group of two eating in the restaurant. I think this place has more to go orders than dine in. They have a large menu so it was hard to choose just one.  The waitress was very nice and accommodating with my requests for only slightly spicy green curry with chicken. It came out perfect. Go with the coconut rice for sure. The sweetness with the spice was great.  My coworker had the Thai spicy eggplant which she also said was very good.  I would definitely go back I'm back in the area."}
{"text":"We had the great pleasure of attending this quaint little restaurant. Blindly I had arranged my husband's birthday dinner here and was not at all disappointed. They took great care of my group of 20 people and arranged the orders so there would be no confusion. I even brought a cake in which they were very kind enough to hold onto and bring out with sparklers that I provided. The staff was very patient with us and not once complained when we became loud at certain points. Children in our group made messes but they were prompt to clean them up. They also offered halal chicken as an option which made dishes enjoyable for some of my party members. The food tasted great! we all ordered some variation of noodles and rice dishes and all tasted very good. the red and green curries were a hit as well as the spring rolls. The portions were large enough to share between 2 to 3 people and the prices were pretty average ranging from 12 to 20 dollars based on the type of meat selected. Next time I will be sure to try the mango salad and coconut rice. The restaurant was well kept with a nice and clean ambience. This place was out of the way as things are not completely developed on that end of brampton but close enough to check out. Thank Lily Thai for a great experience."}
{"text":"Each dish I ordered had a completely different taste, and they were all equally as delicious.  I strongly recommend the coconut steamed rice with any curry, as it adds a wonderful subtle taste and smell to the dish.  The interior was really nice and it had a real \"fine dining\" feel, and was just really elegant.  I strongly recommend this place to anyone, and I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did :) ."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located in a small plaza, and is very clean. The food on other hand was very bland, in which I ordered the green curry chicken and my wife ordered the pad Thai. We also got the chicken spring rolls.  1. The green curry had small thinly sliced chicken white meat; the curry had a strong coconut taste and was oily.  2. The Pad Thai, was totally different in the noodle texture and taste, as my wife always eats Pad Thai and she was dissappointed.  3. Chicken spring rolls had no chicken in it, and tasted more like frozen pre heated vegetable spring rolls.   In conclusion Thai Bamboo on Steeles was closed that day, as that is the best Thai restaurant."}
