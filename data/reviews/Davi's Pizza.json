{"text":"For the location and price it seemed like a good idea. Food is very mediocre and service is terrible. What was supposed to be 15 minutes, ended up being a half hour. As we placed the order, the guy overcharged or got it wrong. Also, he was very rude. I highly advise using cash, as they use their computer for cards. Which seemed sketchy, as it is a website for the payment. The food was greasy, over cooked and mediocre. Pizza was decent, pastas and wings were over cooked."}
{"text":"The pizza is great, definetly  great price and no delivery charge for my area, much better than Pizza Hut across the street will order again, I got a large pepperoni with mushroom. Yummy"}
{"text":"Right now I'm at the pizza joint right now, but man they do have great deals for the pizza and combos. Gotta say that it's good pizza and a great location so yea love the this joint, but Roma pizza is good so try it before you denied it"}
{"text":"This place has to  be the master of subterfuge.  I ordered a Gyro sadwich and a hamburger online. The gyro sandwich is advertised for $6.99 but when I got there I had to pay $10.99. The cook over there told me that is because of the toppings.  I said nowhere on the menu it says there is an extra charge for toppings.  He said that's how the owner wants.  Then I asked for the fries and can of soda for the lunch special.  He said it does not apply online.

This is the last time I will ever go there.  Buyers beware!"}
{"text":"Ordered philly and wings. Good price. Delivered in 30mins., paid cash, no problems. Philly was delicious. Wings were juicy, better than wing stop old hard crusty dried up whatever they server.. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I went there last night and my girlfriend had pasta with meatballs and I had the special XL pizza the food was amazing and costumer service excellent Thks I'll come back 100%
A+++"}
{"text":"The worst order ever!!! Mozzarella sticks was too fat and burned..Deserts is frozen! Like ice tiramisu and ice bahlava..we used a microwave for refrozing..plus smoke smell from the box is last way for my bad mood:( I'm not enjoyed and I'm so sad..0 stars for you guys !!!!"}
{"text":"Just picked up a Philly steak sandwich, the meat tasted ranced and god awful! I called to complain and the guy said he makes it the same as he always does. I told him this was the first time ive had their philly sandwich. It was obviously one of those places that doesn't care about customer service. Its a shame because I live very close, o'well!"}
{"text":"There are slim to none eateries within walking distance from the tire shop we were at, (and we were starving) so pizza it is! I'll admit, I was mildly concerned at first, the reviews for this place were blunt and despairing.

The pizza shop is owned and ran by a rough around the edges Kosovonian family and unfortunately customer service isn't their strong suit. They weren't blatantly rude, they were just straight to the point and a little cold.

Let's talk about the food, it was $2 a slice and 50 cents per topping.

Pizza crust: my crust was pretty great! Nice and crispy, not too thin and not thick. I'm typically picky with crust and normally won't eat it, but it had good flavor. (Edit: my boyfriend said his crust was soggy...whoops! lol) 
Pizza body: It was soft, a little closer to the soggy end. (Still not too bad, if you can deal with that)
Pizza sauce: Not bad, but also not too bold in flavor. 
Pizza topping: Very generous! Lots of ham covered the entire Hawaiian pizza, plus a mountain of pineapple. There were also a nice amount of pepperoni and mushrooms on the other slice. 
Cheese: Decent. There was a good amount of melty mozzarella. 
Size: Nice decent slice. (It filled me up)

Note: Even though they were generous with the pepperoni, it wasn't the highest of quality and didn't have the best flavor. Not even salty. Reminded me of the ready to eat pepperoni in packages such as hormel. 

Jalapeño poppers: $4.99 hot hot hot!  (In temperature) Be careful. In a fit of hunger, I definitely burned the rooftop of my mouth. The jalapeño wasn't spicy at all and thinner than I've had. Also a generous amount of scalding hot cheese with a nice crispy crust. It wasn't poor, it just wasn't groundbreaking - average at most. I wouldn't think of ordering it again. 

Damage: We paid roughly about $17 for 2 slices, jalapeño poppers, and a coke can. Hey, we even handed him a hundo and he gave back the correct change. So call us lucky! No scamy scams this time."}
{"text":"Well I was staying at the LVH and this flyer was under my door. The price was cheap and they advertised if you purchased online you would get 20% off and free delivery. Well that is great but when you go to put your credit in into the site first its not secure and second your card wont go through. When I called to tell them this they tried to charge me 2 bucks to take a card. I explained it wasn't my fault and they waived it for me. The next night I tried again (I had also recommended it to our friends who also had this same issue) this time I called explained the issue and the guy WOULD not waive it. This is CLEARLY a scam to get you to call in to place the order so they can charge the fee. . The food is mediocre and the people are rude and scamy. I wouldnt recommend this place at all. VERY UNSATISFIED. Also I complained to the HOTEL. LVH said it is against there policy to have them on the property and that they would contact them. SO SCAMY!!!!  LVH doesnt allow deliveries."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure that I'll be avoiding this place in the future, which is annoying because it's right around the corner from my office.

First off, their pizza is good.  Especially, when you consider that out of the dozens of stand-alone pizza shops in Las Vegas, not many of them are that impressive.  This place is.

Second, their prices are decent.  We usually partake of the lunch special where you can get two slices of cheese pizza and a can of soda for $3.99.  I think that's a pretty great deal considering that the two slices are HUGE.

However, their customer service is so bad, it's non-existent.  The first time my co-workers and I went to this place, at noon, to get lunch, the open sign was off and the doors were locked.  We waited about ten minutes and somebody finally pulled up and seemed annoyed that there were people waiting to be let in.  That annoyed me.  If they happen to get an order wrong (which happens far too often as their English isn't that great) they go to EXTREME lengths to convince the customer that it was their fault and not the other way around.

All in all, I just don't think decent food is worth the fact that I leave pissed off each time I go here.  Once again, I'll pass on going back until they learn how to properly treat their customers."}
{"text":"Ordered from here on grubhub and it took almost two hours to get my food. I live about 5 minutes away. I eventually called and asked where my food was and the lady said the drivers on his way. Half an hour goes by and still no food so we called again. She said the same thing. When we did get our food it was okay... Not the best but not too bad. I'll never order from here again though because it's not worth the ridiculous wait time."}
{"text":"I have never experienced such rude service before. Ordered delivery for a total of 25 bucks and food was terrible. I called to complain about the food and request a refund. There \"manager\" spoke with me in the phone and he told me to put the food in my refrigerator and he would call me back tomorrow and he would think about if he was going to refund my order. So of coarse the next day no phone call. So I went to his store and confronted him about it, and his classic answer was my food is great and everyone loves it. So after nearly 30 mins of verbal arguing in his \"restaurant\" he finally refunded the order after people walked in and wouldn't be embarrassed. Stay away!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered food from these people online.  It took an hour and a half for the driver to get here and they are literally around the corner.  I had to call them an hour after ordering and the guy that answered the phone told me the driver had already left and he would call the driver to see where he was at and he would call me back.  Needless to say he never called me back.  Twenty more minutes went by and I called again.  This time he said I didnt call you back because the driver was in the neighborhood.  I asked if the food would be hot and they said yes.  So when the driver finally made it I checked the food and it wss ice cold.  They tried to give it to me for FREE.  I dont want old cold food.  I want to pay for fresh hot food.  Do not order from these people.  They are liers.  Avoid this restaraunt."}
{"text":"Not sure why the bad reviews here...It's a small pizza joint conjoined to a mini mart. Not the worse scenario. The guy there taking the orders is nice, he takes the order, takes the money and is tells me how long it'll be. That's all I need, don't need to know how the wife and kids are doing, right?! 
They actually have a nice girl working there, in training, but she's doing all right.
Pizza has always been good, as have the wings, fingers, fries et al."}
{"text":"Apparently this place is out of business. They still have online ordering available. Beware and don't order online cause nothing will come!"}
{"text":"Just tried the 7.99 xlarge cheese pizza pick up special. It is very good with the perfect amount of cheese and sauce. The people working were nice too. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Beware of Pizza Places with prices too good to be true.

Got a flier in my door. Was desparate, and didn' t feel like going out. So, gave it a try.

Delivery was too quick,and that had me worried. I was right.

Ordred a combo two topping pizza. Toppings were very sparce, pizza was on par with a bargain frozen pizza, almost. Pizza seemed cold, even though it was delivered within 30 minutes after call.

Not good at all. Wouldn't serve it to a teen ager who wouldn't know the difference, or a totally stoned loadie.

Pass on this one."}
{"text":"Very good quality food and prices are very good the new owner certainly change things I certainly would recommend it to anybody"}
{"text":"This place just opened up. Used to be Roma's. 

I just ordered spaghetti and meatballs. Comes with garlic bread. First of all the guy at the counter was eating a piece of bread didn't wash his hand or nothing. He tried to over charge me. And he Appologized for that the food took 36 minutes to have ready. And there was no customers in there. 

Spaghetti was over cooked. The garlic bread had no garlic just butter. Bright side of the meal was the Cesar salad which the lettuce was nice and crispy."}
{"text":"If I could give them an additional .5 star I would. Pretty decent pizza considering all the negative reviews. I usually judge a pizza by whether or not I finish the crust and this place's dough is prettyyy good (yes I ate the crust ). Sure the cheese and pepperoni are not the highest quality ingredients but that's a given; and you get what you pay for.... Mozzarella sticks were good and didn't arrive cold upon delivery A++ for that. Chicken wings were kind of small and a little over done and dry but still decent."}
{"text":"We ordered waited one hour pizza never came.  Called they said new guy snswered phone didnt know this location changed hours even though menu says 12m.  Dont order from here if you ever want to get your food.  Its a good chance they will take your  order and the food will never arrive.  How does the order taking call center not know the hours of all locations."}
{"text":"Extremely horrible customer service. I asked for my hot sauce on the side for my chicken wings and when my food was delivered there was no sauce at all... So I called and the owner himself told me he had out the sauce in the bag that I'm a lair! WHAT?! Why would someone lie about some sauce like ate you really that cheap... their chicken wings were so tiny there was barely any meat on the bone and if there was it was crispy from the deep fryer... I will never order from there again. If I can put no stars I would cause it deserves none at all"}
{"text":"Food was bad but the delivery was unbelieveable. It took forever and the driver had the audacity to tell me he didn't have change for my order. It cost $13 and I had $20. That's a little more than a fifty percent tip for terrible,  cold pizza and long wait time. Never again."}
