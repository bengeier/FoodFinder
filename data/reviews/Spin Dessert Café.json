{"text":"4.5/5!  Had this place bookmarked for a while now and finally got the chance to head over there with my girlfriends. Probably a once in a while thing mostly cause it's pretty far from my area but it's okay.   The place itself is really cute and I really like the set up. It's a bit similar to Demetres in terms of its indoor/outdoor seating plans. It was FREEZING when we were in there, like ice cold. Some of us went back to the car to grab a sweater.   Our waitress was so sweet and not pushy at all and always came at the right times. When we were done, she left us for quite a bit but we didn't really mind cause we were catching up and I feel like she sensed that and wanted to give us a bit more time.   We all got some crepe variation, unfortunately I don't remember what everyone else got but I got Sugar Sugar, which is basically cake batter dough ice cream wrapped in a crepe with brownie bits and raw cookie dough bits scattered on the side, as well as whipped cream on either side of the plate and a hot fudge sauce on the side.   It. Was. Delicious. Yummmmm. Same verdict from the other girls! I find it's basically like Demetres but with less dessert options (they offer tons of savory dishes as well) and a bit less expensive depending on what you get. Definitely recommend :)"}
{"text":"It's an A-OK place. Desserts are amazing, and they're open late. I don't know how many times we have been to this place at mid-night, and they still serves.   They have dozens of selections, but I'm a waffle kind of man (crepes, not so much) with the tenacity of being mean, strong, and ready to get the friction on. I find that the warm round, but rough edges of the waffle, topped with an ice cream makes my mouth moist. Thinking about it as we speak makes me want to get up, do lunges, and head to Spin and grab a plate of delicious dessert."}
{"text":"After having Demtres a few times, this place was a breath of fresh air.   They have more unique ice cream flavours and more interesting desserts.   This time, we tried \"Scarlett\", which was red velvet ice cream on a waffle and white Chocolate sauce. I thought the waffle was amazing, better than Demtres at least. The red velvet ice cream was also quite interesting.   Overall, I think it's a good place to try. And if you use Yelp, you'll get 10% off! Be careful of parking, they don't have a Private lot.   So give it a shot if you're in the area. Let me know what you think! Bon Appetit!! :-)"}
{"text":"I had some good crepes here once. The other time I went the cake I ordered for a birthday was the worst red velvet ever, crumbly dry cake with a thick, tasteless icing. Hot drinks were also far too sweet. Best left to its regulars, noisy teens visiting after going to the Cineplex across the road."}
{"text":"Went with a group and most of us had a vegetarian pizza. Not impressed! Pizza was undercooked and wasn't even hot when it go to the table. Service was meh. Washrooms had a broken sink and soap dispensers that weren't working.  I'd heard a lot about this place and came away disappointed. Definitely wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Checked out Spin Dessert Cafe last night and my Carrot Cake was dry.....OMG. My girlfriends enjoyed their desserts so I guess next time I go to Spin I will order a NON-Cake Dessert something like a Waffle or Crepe at least I know it's made while you wait."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for the last few years and they have noticeably gone downhill with the service. Good remains unchanged but waiting 20 minutes to place and order for water and then another 25 to receive it :(  Furthermore asking 2 waitresses on 3 separate occasions for a bill, and then getting it 15 minutes later. Place was not packed, was a Monday evening. Maybe more wait staff would be better"}
{"text":"Spin is great. They have a vast, fun menu matched with a cute atmosphere. Especially love the waffles and lava cake. Good place to go to with friends or family.   Only complaint is that service (although very kind) is often hit or miss, the place is pretty empty when it's not their movie rush (Friday/Saturday/Sunday nights) and yet some of the servers disappear foreverrrrr."}
{"text":"I have been to Spin three times over the past month and a half.  Their ice cream, crepes and waffles are delicious and their prices are reasonable.  The ambience is good and the staff are friendly.  I think the main issue is parking for this place.  Spin is located under a condo across the street from Cineplex on Queensway.   Parking is available in the laneway in the back of the building and at night people often park in the LCBO parking lot. In the summer I can see people parking across in the cinema/restaurant parking lots, but definitely not too many will venture in the winter.  The food is good and I hope that people will come no matter what.   I have to say that my only disappointment was a \"present' that the owner gave for a relative that had a birthday.  We brought about 18 people to Spin to have dessert for my aunt's birthday.  I noticed the owner measuring a VERY SMALL scoop of ice cream in their syrup ladels and topped it off with whip cream...I thought they were just experimenting with something.  But to my disbelief  they brought  it over to say happy birthday. My goodness what was the point... really what do you do with that small amount of ice cream after you just ate ice cream and a crepe.  Why not bring this earlier, why not give a decent amount, why even do this?  Either do the gesture fully or don't do it at all.   Especially, with a new business...you want to impress your new customers with an experience, not lessen it with trivial things like this. I will continue to go to Spin because the food was good...but disappointed by something that did not have to be disappointing."}
{"text":"Love the food and customer service! Had lunch and dessert and both were very filling.  I had the Thai express crepe and the \"Irreplaceable\" (ice cream and strawberries crepe) for dessert. Would recommend for a day/night out or just dessert. It is pricey but a nice treat for yourself or someone else."}
{"text":"Came here for dessert last night with a friend who comes here often. The decor reminded me of a hotel bar - sort of funky in a generic, please-everyone kind of way, with nothing special but nothing especially off-putting. The service was quick but not overly friendly, though I did appreciate how often my water glass was refilled.  My friend recommended the crepes (\"to die for\" were her exact words), but as I'd already eaten a full dinner I needed something a little smaller, which as it turns out is nearly impossible at Spin. I wound up with a slice of cheesecake, hold the ice cream. This saved me $4 off the menu price, and judging by the scoop of ice cream on the plate at the table next to me was a wise and economical decision - $4 for a small scoop of ice cream?!  My salted caramel cheesecake was in fact one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten. The crust was perfect, the cheesecake was amazing, the caramel on top was delicious, I loved the whole thing.  I won't go back to Spin unless someone else suggests it. It's a little too pricey, the experience is a little bland, and though the dessert is fantastic I think I could find something comparable with an atmosphere that's more my style."}
{"text":"The service gets worse and worse every time I come here.  The waitress/hostess likes to tell everyone she will be with them \"in a second\" and then disappears until someone else seats the customer.  Today I was left waiting in a semi-empty Cafe for 3 minutes before another waiter seated me.   Was then left sitting for almost 10 minutes before being acknowledged again.  Another 10 before any water came, and a disappointing 30 minutes after ordering, my food arrived.    How long does it take to warm a chocolate chip cookie and an apple pie?    While sitting there waiting, we had the opportunity to watch the staff dilly dally while customers waited to be seated, orders waiting to be taken, and food to be brought.   Ironically enough, the bill came quickly when requested.   At least the food is good.  Staff needs more training, it's getting ridiculously unacceptable."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I visited Spin & needless to say I am very disappointed.  The quality of the desserts has gone down considerably. My family & I started coming here when they first opened & the desserts were amazing. I ordered the Nutella/banana Crepe. When it  ame to my table, the nutella was very watery anf tasted very bad. Nutella is not watery nor shpykd it be watered down. I feel now that Spin has the business they no longer take any more pride in the quality of the food/desserts. Needless to say, I will never be back & I will be sharing by word of mouth of my bad experience. Too bad!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Expensive and the chocolate cheesecake we got tasted like it was defrosted and then sat in a fridge for a week, which I'm sure is exactly what happened. Incredibly dry and tasteless. The ice cream of the month that we ordered was cappuccino crunch. There was no crunch and it had a weird taste to it. I would never go back and waste my money here.   Server was friendly though, coffee was good. That's the end of it."}
{"text":"It was first time at spin yesterday and honestly not too impressed. Very similar to demetres.   We were seated right away which was good. Food was alright, not so great. It's your typical dessert cafe menu but with more selections. The food wait was a bit long but the staff kept apologizing so it wasn't that bad.  My problem was the noise level. The store probably can't control the noise level with customers, it was insanely loud that my bf and I couldn't hear each other. You would pretty much yell to each other to be heard.  Would I go again? Probably not"}
{"text":"Great crepes and waffles . The latte was really good as well. A great addition to the neighborhood. I will be back for sure"}
{"text":"If you want to go crazy with desserts, this is the place :) Lots of choices, friendly staff and the seating is amazing. They are also open late. In my opinion an excellent date spot. Great location too."}
{"text":"I have been to Spin quite a few times, usually due to circumstance and it's location in respect to the theatre.  There is no parking or street parking, so you have to park across the street where the theatre etc is. I really used to enjoy it but my last few visits have been unimpressive and I'm not sure if I will go back.    It seems that perhaps the management has stopped caring, the food quality has gone down and the evnironment is not as clean as I would like.  I just feel that for what they charge, there is room for improvement.  When it gets busy, the service really suffers.  It seems they don't want to bring in enough staff for busy nights and everyone seems in a panic, which does not contribute to a positive experience.  As for the food, the ice cream is amazing.  The cakes are hit and miss.  The crepes are usually decent as long as they are not burnt.    I think I'm starting to come to the conclusion that Spin just isn't good for my figure :)"}
{"text":"The service was ok, food seemed to focus and centre around ice cream Sundaes, that turned out to be bigger than we expected. With them being incredibly sweet we were unable to finish them because they were way to sweet and rich, keep in mind I usually enjoy sweet desserts. It wasn't the worst dessert I've had but it is no where near the best, mediocre at best. If you were in the area this is a place you can keep in mind, but don't expect much. I probably wouldn't go back here."}
{"text":"I came here looking to satiate my craving for some sugary goodness - and satiated I was! This place is very reminiscent of Cafe Demetre's, and offers a variety of waffle and crepe combinations, as well as sundaes, cakes, and all sorts of yummie coffee drinks and smoothies. They also have monthly specials, were they feature a specific flavour.   I came here on a random weekday, and the place wasn't too busy, which is a good thing because they only had one waitress serving the whole place. Said waitress gave us a run through of the menu and left us to make our choices.   I decided on a waffle with raspberry and chocolate ice cream, fresh raspberries and chocolate fudge. My companion chose a vanilla bean cheesecake.   My waffle was really good. Super indulgent, and it totally quenched my sugar craving! I wasn't too impressed with their chocolate raspberry ice cream - it was just OK. However, I was expecting great as they apparently make all their ice creams in house, and our waitress told us that their focus and speciality is their ice cream. On the other hand, my companion was less than impressed with his cheesecake, however that is probably mostly due to his own personal preference, and not because the cake itself wasn't good. I had a bite of it and enjoyed it.   All in all, I'll definitely be returning to Spin whenever I am at the Queensway for a movie and a sugar craving hits me."}
{"text":"They used to be good but now it's just disgusting. The whole place is dirty, the patio is locked up for some random reason, the washrooms are nasty (which makes me believe the kitchen is probably equally nasty). They no longer accept credit card or debit, cash only! The service is ridiculously slow now, and it's insanely overpriced. $11.50 for a slice of cake?!  Two slices of cake and two coffees, with tip came out to almost $40.00 - and cash only, with no ATM either.  The cakes were frozen from La Rocca, so I imagine the 15 minutes we waited to get our slice was them trying to defrost the pieces? The ice cream was just randomly thrown on the plate covering half our cakes, like they really really don't care. It's almost as if they *know* they're about to close, and are just over it at this point. Save your money and go elsewhere for $40.00 worth of frozen stale cake I guess?"}
{"text":"I have been here several times but the last time we were here we had a bad experience.  Everything was good until we got the bill, our waitress, a blond lady (so if shes your waitress check your bill!!), decided to put 21% GRATUITY on the bill for a table of two. Correct me if Im wrong but isn't mandatory tip of 15% only applies to a table of 6 or more? We were livid and left with tipping her an extra $3 because my boyfriend didn't want to talk to her but I wished we took every penny in change that we wouldve gotten back or at least question her why we had to pay her this."}
{"text":"Quality of food decent as long as they haven't run out of what you're looking to get, prices a tad high, and customer service decent.  This is my second visit to Spin Dessert Café, and I've come to realize that each time I've attended, they seem to be missing some component(s) from certain items on their menu.  I found prices to not be astronomically high, however they did seem a bit much for a desert place.  I found customer service to be much better this time than it was the first time we went: the waitress did not try catering to the group that I was with at all, where-as this time the waiter was very friendly and polite and had no problems catering to us.  All-in-all, while I wouldn't say that this is my favorite desert place, I'd consider returning there for another bite to eat at some point."}
{"text":"Contemporary, laid back. Lots of dessert options. Ice cream was good, not overly sweet.   Took awhile to seat people into tables that have been empty for 20 mins which was strange. Added that the menu is not the easiest to understand, I would say that efficiency is not their forte.   That being said, it's makes a good hangout place in an area that doesn't seem to have much late night happenings.   I'd recommend if u r a dessert fan. Street parking available behind the building. Avoiding the LCBO lot to avoid the tickets."}
{"text":"Located on the North side of the Queensway just west of Islington, it's a cute little spot for a date or for a catch up with a friend. We've been here twice and usually try something new. They have all kinds of stuff on the menu, so sure to please your sweet tooth no matter what kind of dessert you are into. I usually go for one of their incredible Sundae creations. My boyfriend is a fan of their waffles. Always enjoy going back!"}
{"text":"Finally some more options on places to go have dessert. Spin dessert menu is quite vast and you can find a lot of goodies.   The service was fast, good and the staff was quite friendly. I tried there waffle and latte and the waffle was nice, not too soft and not too hard just about right; the latte was good and the right size for the buck.   The restaurant itself is beautifully designed and very appealing to chill and relax. They don't have their own parking so you will have to look in the streets or park across in the cineplex complex at your own risk.   I would definitely visit again, there is too much to try."}
{"text":"Had a carrot cake here for a reasonable $5.96 and latte.  Would have it again or if the mood struck me I would come back.  My 7 yr old daughter had a lava cake, she is connoisseur of them, and liked it better then Milestone ibaraa cake.  Also the LCBO are Nazis ad watch for patrons parking in their lot and will have toe car tagged and towed. Parking is on street just north and easy access through lcbo lot."}
{"text":"Arrived at SPIN at 10:23pm.   Patrons ahead informed us it would be minimum 20 minute wait.  We noticed several tables were unoccupied but not cleared off.  We were seated at 10:44.  Our server came by minutes later to check with us.  She came back again minutes after and took our order and said she would bring us water.  She brought a tray full of glasses of water...But not for us.  We waited. And waited.  In that time she had waited three times on the table across from ours.  At 11:10 she once again promised us water.  At 11:20 still no water.  We are now 36mins in from being seated.  No water, no coffee, no dessert!!!!  Our waitress passed us again with no acknowledgment.  I hailed her over and asked her again for water.  She said she will bring us some water and that she is not lying.  We noticed that all the staff appeared to be calm and yet it was evident that they were either short staffed or poorly managed.   At 11:25 we walked out. What a waste of 1hr.   We've been there on several occasions prior but have never had such a horrible experience.   WILL NEVER RETURN AGAIN!!!  Very ignorant waitress insisting that she is not lying about bringing water after she promised us water twice before."}
{"text":"After an unsuccessful first visit at Spin, I decided to give it another shot. I'm happy to yelp that the service was much better. We were quickly attended to and received our order in just a few minutes.  I tried one of this month's special, the banana smoothie and it was delicious. Probably one of the best banana smoothies I've ever had.  I'm now a fan of SPIN. It's great to see a restaurant that goes above and beyond to make their patrons happy."}
{"text":"Been in this place 3 times.. I liked the atmosphere and I used to get friends for dessert (choco waffles is good) and same thing tonite but instead we wanted to have a savory bite.  Arrived inside.. They as well were very friendly, they got a nice seat for us, bring water, and ordered.  My friends got 2 pizza and I went for a salad. (Im a chef and I had a busy day tasting food here and there so opted for a light supper).  Seated at 8.40 .. After 20 minutes I had to stand up to wonder about our order.. We were hungry and nobody showed up to care about us. The server (Isabel) had a such of attitude and not even she apologized but just came out saying that other orders were head and seemed like to argu.  Well I was saying anything I was just wondering about my food. So they said 1 minute and it will be on the table.  That's true. So after 35 minute we started eating. Amen. Pizza was delicious and salad very abundant, just a bit dry and dressing wasn't enough frankly. But I didn't want to stand up again and pass by a bad one. If not, when I placed my fork in my salad , after 3/4 bites, I start seeing spoiled leaves mixed to rotten parts.  Awful guys. Disgusting. I haven't resisted and I headed the cash and showed them the plate, told them that I'm also a chef (I hate this part) I want to be a regular client. I complained for the service not for the food, overall. I respect this job and who works in this industry. I understand that this may happens everywhere.. Also in my restaurant but want I don't tolerate the unpoliteness and the attitude to not even apologize. Try to make things smoother. Smile. Or come at the table make sure your guest is ok, happy and be sure to have a great food experience. We paid regularly and in full. Just not for the spoiled salad but still no words or regrets. Cmon!!  I promised to not write a review. I'm not into it. I've asked for a manager or owner number to discuss about this event but I rather preferred to let people know. Stay away from not courtesy places. Check your salad. Your food. Health is an important matter."}
{"text":"This place is one of Etobicoke's best go-to places to hang out, kill some time, eat dessert, and stay out late. Spin is the better of \"that other ice dessert place\" and people are catching on. I've been at this location countless times and most recently tried the chocolate peanut butter ice cream and brownie combo. It was really good, but much bigger than I expected!   I highly recommend anything with banana, chocolate and waffles. Recently they've been giving out freebies of smoothies and they've also introduced a listserv so customers are updated about promos and special events at this location.   The staff are usually very nice, and the place is usually packed. Great first date option, especially since it's close to a movie theater .  The only reason I didn't give SPIN 5-stars is because in the past staff have been 'carefree' shall we say in terms of providing attentive service, but overall, it's definitely worth the visit. I'm really glad it's doing well since it opened and I'm happy there are other locations sprouting up in the city."}
{"text":"(4.5*)  I really love going here for the deccadent desserts with icecream combos on waffles or crepes! Each and everytime their combinations never fail to dissappoint and ever since having the hot apple cider for the first time, I always get it to pair with my dessert of choosing.   This time I got the \"On the Floor\" Pistaccio Icecream with a crepe, shaved chocolate, pistacios, and fudge drizzle and whipped cream.  I really liked how the pistaccio icecream wasn't overpowering and the crepe was just right! The softness of the crepe, icecream, and whipped creme all together made me feel like I was on clouds. The apple cider could've been a little hotter tonight but thats okay, maybe just an off day.  The last few times I went here, I did order a chipotle chicken pizza and holy was it good! I'm sure their other savoury dishes are just as amazing and wowing, you'd never expect a dessert place to serve such delights.  Have not tried any of their cakes so I can't say but I'd like to try one day :)"}
{"text":"Wow, I didn't know Etobicoke could have such a nice place ;)  Just stopped into Spin tonight after dinner with some friends and indulged in some great desserts and coffee.  Its a very comfortable, modern atmosphere and delicious food - looks like they even have a regular, though small, food menu including breakfast.  I might have to stop in one morning, especially since I live so close.    Spin is a great addition to the area and I plan on stopping in all summer."}
{"text":"This place is only 10 steps away from my front door, serves dessert and is open late. All these factors equal a recipe for a Maureen over-indulging disaster! BUTTTTTT it's not! I have never been blown away by any of the few visits to Spin Dessert Cafe and my waistline thanks me for it... I currently have an abundance of existing bad-for-your-body food addictions already. There's no way my body could handle a junk food cafe obsession!  I'm not gonna lie though... Their current feature ice cream flavour for the month of April, Lemon Meringue Pie is pretty damn tasty! I had the \"I Dream of Spring\" crepe the other day and was quite please! Plus I love the fact the white chocolate sauce is served on the side. Dessert places have a tendency to over drench everything with whatever sauce they have! Have you ever tried drinking your way to eating a crepe?! It's disgusting! Spin, you get an A+ for not making me do that! Oh and bravo on the meringue bits, genius!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent deserts - not super pricey but not cheap either. Comparable to Demetre's.  I went with my husband on Valentine's Day and it was PACKED (understandably). We managed to get a table fairly quickly and shortly after we got seated, a SWARM of people came in.  Since it's across the street from Queensway Cineplex, I feel that their busy-ness happens in waves (when movies are done).  All in all fairly decent place. Not a huge fan of deserts but for those that are, I recommend it."}
{"text":"It's hard to stay away from this place! My only negative comment is that it should be bigger (i.e. More seating) but the food is amazing!  I've tried a few different ice cream flavours and I've tried the crepes as well as the waffles and they are all delicious.  Great spot to go out with friends on a Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"Okay, let me start off by saying that I have a very hard time being critical when it comes to desserts. I am a natural sweet tooth. You could take me to the dentist give me a hard candy, and I'd think it was the best place ever. Hard to find parking but we snuck in a spot at the end of LCBO. A lot more open and roomy compared to the Demetres I've gone to and surprisingly not busy at all for a Saturday evening. Lots of comfortable seating including the patio which works fab for Summer. Service was good, our waitress was very cheerful, and didn't seem to mind our sugar high children lol. A good 'cafe' selection pizza, sandwiches, crepes, waffles, and icecream are only some of the few. Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"If you're a dairy eater, congrats! This place is awesome. If you're not, then you get to eat a plate of fruit or their sad apple pie. The apple pie isn't bad, but placed beside a 4 pound monstrosity of ice cream, fixins and waffle, you may as well be eating a cookie you found on the floor of your car.  That said, the staff know their stuff and our server was super friendly. The atmosphere is comfortable, kind of like being in a nice cafe. I much prefer it to Demetre's carousel of madness.  I'd refer friends here, but I'll probably hang out in the LCBO parking lot, drinking wine from a paper bag while they eat.  Speaking of, we parked in that lot. I'm not sure whether they have parking on their own and you can NOT park on the Queensway there."}
{"text":"OMG....the service is so slow I finished my chai tea latte before I even saw my dessert and we had to ask WTH was our dessert. The desserts are really good, but I am not sure if it is really worth the wait. Let's see if the compensate us for our wait. They did apologise, but we have not gotten the bill yet."}
{"text":"Everything about Spin was terrible. We were served water after a half hour into our stay. Then we were told our server would be with us shortly and she came a half hour later. Upon making our order we waited another hour for the food to come and after 2 hour of waiting and being lied to about when we would get service we left. The staff showed no indication of concern. Worst food establishment I've been to in my life. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"I wanted to love it because I love dessert but we weren't impressed. The service was painfully slow. It was a Monday night and so not what we expected. As in 90 min long when we had planned on a quick after dinner dessert. Everything took forever - ordering, getting the bill, water to the table and so forth. My dessert was good but the other two didn't enjoy theirs at all, sad they'd had much better. It's a shame! I asked a few friends who had been previously if it was just an off night and they said that is typical."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for the first time. The hostess was really nice and so was our waitress.  My friend and I were impressed by the menu. Love the names of the food. Everything sounded so good. We were impressed by the presentation of our crepes. The crepes were so delicious, but the only downfall was that there was too much ice cream. I feel bad for not finishing it, but I was so full.   This place is really nice. I'm just not a big fan of the decor. It's very cheesy. The colours were not really inviting. The concept of the design just played with idea of the word spin (which I get, but it is redundant and like I said earlier - cheesy) The layout of the space is pretty dumb. The waitress told us to follow her as we got in, but realized the seats she wanted to take us were reserved and tried to get into the centre of the area, but in order to get in there we had to turn around and basically enter from the corridor of the entrance. Brilliant!   Regardless of the bad design, the food was good and so was the music they played."}
{"text":"Had the most lovely carrot cake, homemade piña colada ice cream and New York style strawberry cheesecake -- all at one sitting I can barely move,  but it was worth it!  The London Fog tea is also delightful as an alternative to those who don't drink lattes. I'm coming back -- I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"I wish they had a Wheel-o-Dessert.   SPIN the wheel and voila.   Landed on Staying Alive($9.00).  Decorator made the place a little too fuzzy inside. Hot Pink with multiple shades with White contrast. Doesn't make me dizzy but evokes a feeling... Hard to describe.  Claustrophobic(?)  For me.  Desserts & Drinks all no complaints. The cost of the Cafe stay is factored in the prices. I'm sure you know those kind of Cafes/Tea Shops. I wish I could pay less if I cut my stay short.  I don't really use Free Wifi anyways."}
{"text":"Over priced, quality not great just generally left feeling unsatisfied. I ordered a cappuccino and crepe. The cappuccino had no foam and was more like a latte..... The crepe came cold and soggy and the ice-cream was tasteless.... Overall left feeling \"what a waste of calories!\""}
{"text":"Spin Cafe is actually very similar to Demetre's, so think of Demetre's as a starting point.   Differences:  1) I feel like it's a little more of a laid back, calmer atmosphere. I'll credit this to their use of more neutral colours in the cafe decor.   2) They have a lot of musical references in their menu, which includes a whole section where every dessert is named after a song. This was quite interesting to go through the first couple times.  3) This is the differentiator right here: They have monthly themes that I almost always order from. I've had the pumpkin theme in October, the s'mores theme another month, and so on. My favourite part about the themed months is their ice cream. S'mores ice cream is actually amazing, ditto pumpkin.   So the place is very similar to Demetre's, but the thing that sets it apart is the monthly themes. I'd come every month if I could.   They have a location opening right in the Mississauga core. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Great dessert place to go late on a weekend, especially after your movie. It's conveniently located across from cineplex. They have great desserts!!! Especially crepes! Stuff that even demetres wouldn't have, like their pistachio ice cream with a delicious crepe. Great spot for a date :) just no parking at resturant, just in cineplex plaza."}
{"text":"Favourite spin location. I'd recommend the chicken pesto crepe if you're looking for a light meal rather than dessert."}
{"text":"Very friendly hostess this Saturday night. Polite, comfortable and friendly great service  all night with our party of 7.  Delicious as always ice cream!"}
{"text":"Spin Dessert (The Queensway Location)  Service: 3/5 - It was ok, a bit slow.  The server looked like he wasn't interested in working tonight.   Quality of Food: 5/5 - Dessert from SPIN is always good. No complaints here. They offer quite a unique experience for dessert. Totally recommend this place for impressing family and friends. The carrot cake is to die for!!!!   Temperature of Food: 4/5 - unfortunately the downfall of crepes with ice cream is that by the time you receive your dessert it's a bit more like a puddle of ice cream. I just wish there is a way to keep that ice cream still frozen long enough for you to eat it, rather than drink it.   Value of Meals: 3/5 - Prices are a bit pricey, compared to some places I've visited SPIN is more on the expensive side.   Atmosphere: Unique and fun experience. If your here for the dessert you won't be disappointed.   Would I Return: Yes  Time of Meal: After dinner dessert."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place whenever I crave dessert since it opened. I've always enjoyed the dessert here, it's pretty good and meets my standards but the service is pretty slow. Waited a little over 25 minutes for one dessert plate today. I usually go up the the cash  to pay for my bill rather than waiting over 10 minutes for a server to come and ask.   Ps. The crepe was just a little bit under cooked today but never had this problem before."}
{"text":"I got One Sweet Day on a crepe. It was absolutely heavenly!! One Sweet Day was strawberry ice cream and fresh strawberries with graham pie crust and whipped cream. Their ice cream is made in house and that alone would keep me coming back for more! The strawberries weren't the sweetest. The portions were quite large so make sure you bring your appetite, or a buddy. The service was fast and friendly. It wasn't too busy and I went on a Saturday night. The only slight inconvenience was that the card machines were down so it was cash only. It was also conveniently placed right across from the Queensway Cineplex and right off the main road. Overall I would definitely recommend this place and I will be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Kim the manager is great! Service is usually pretty good, being prompt, accurate and always filling my water glass! The food, whether sweet or savoury is always satisfying to my palette and belly! It gets busy so depending on what time you're there, you are either ok or have to wait!  It can get loud also depending on the patronage and music playing. Atmosphere is nice, it's an overall fun place to be at. The price is decent!  The only thing is parking. As a customer I understand  where to park (behind, across, NOT AT THE LCBO, BUT as a resident of the condo above... please be quiet!! Sometimes we have to sleep and wake up early the next day so waking up to the Spin customers at 1am in the lot can get annoying.."}
{"text":"Due to some random turn of events and failed attempts at trying other dessert establishments, we ended up walking into Sp!n. I'm glad we did, because I was pretty impressed with most everything that was had.  So they have this... Hazelnut crepe thingamajigger. It's called \"So Much to Say.\" I'm not sure I understand the name. What do you have so much to say about? Are you going to say something about the desserts? Or maybe you have a lot to say about the hazelnuttiness of this particular dessert? A person like me does not do well with such ambiguity.  I don't care for crepes, so the girlfriend and I decided that switching it out for a Belgian waffle (for an additional 95 cents) was the thing to do. So we're talkin' a Belgian waffle with bananas, roasted hazelnuts, a mountainous serving of hazelnut ice cream, and then you top off this Moby Dick of a dessert with some warm hazelnut sauce. This thing is delightful. Full. Of. Delight. Often, a big dessert gets to be too much by the end because it's too sweet, too heavy, too everything. But with this thing, every step of the (obesity-causing) journey was delicious; it wasn't so rich or sweet that you wanted to stop. Yet, I did stop because:  1. It's big. Bigger still if you go here after a meal somewhere else. 2. It's mostly ice cream, which gets melty and hard to eat; unless you're planning on scarfing it down right when it arrives. On that note, spoons would be preferable. It's really hard to eat ice cream with a fork.  3. I was also occasionally noshing on the girlfriend's sister's dessert (Warmed Chocolate Peanut Butter Brownie), which was equally massive/filling.  Suffice it to say, significant portions (of both desserts) were left behind. I feel bad about wasting food, but it's not the kind of stuff that you can pack up and take home. The option for smaller serving sizes would be nice. I don't know if you Sp!n people actually read these things, but I'm just throwin' that idea out there. That's right, an American is asking for smaller portions.   There are savory crepes, and other non-dessert food options. They also have Cheesecake Factory cakes available, which to me is a giant meh, but I'm sure there are people who care about that. The Chocolate Peanut Butter Brownie was delicious also, but a bit too decadent for my taste. I can't imagine that you'll go wrong with anything you pick here. Just remember it's all heading for those hefty thighs that you got from your mother."}
{"text":"Great chilling place before the movie!  Love the cinnamon apple crepe with tropical green tea."}
{"text":"A Great place for Desserts! The location also is perfect, just across the Cineplex Odeon Queensway, it becomes a perfect treat for Movie and Dessert. We usually go to the late night shows and this being open till late is always on our list. As for the desserts and snacks, there is a wide variety to choose from and they also have monthly specials. We've tried a few things here including Chocolate Lava Cake, New York Style Cheesecake and Crepes, Hot and Cold Beverages, but our favorite is the Turn Back Time on a Waffle ! Every single time they make it delicious and worth it. We ate the Pizza and Crepe once, it was ok, not as good as their desserts.  The staff is also courteous and helpful, once I requested the coffee to be warmed up, she took it away and got a new fresh hot cup, the service is reasonable time, good amount of seating as well. The ambience and atmosphere is great, especially presentation of desserts is amazing! Among the disadvantages I see is the Parking - the convenient place is the LCBO parking lot but there's no dedicated parking for Spin. Also recently they changed their policy and accept Cash Only, No Debit or Credit, so make sure take enough cash beforehand. Sometimes on weekend nights, there can be a lot of wait. We keep coming back to this place and surely recommend to one and all !! Your time and money is really well spent !!"}
{"text":"I went there last night for crepes, had We will rock you & enjoyed it. It had coffee flavoured ice cream with chocolate shavings, whip cream & chocolate sauce at the side. My friend had the PB crepe & enjoyed it.  The service is slow here though. We waited 5 min to get seated. I also saw a lot of tables not cleared  & people were gone already. Our table was dirty & had to ask the hostess to clean it.  The cakes were over priced, $10-11 for a slice of cake!!"}
{"text":"HEAVENLY. That's what this place is for anyone with a sweet tooth!  Crepes. Waffles. French Toast. Freshly made ice cream. Cakes. Imported cakes from the Cheesecake Factory. Smoothies. Sundaes. Shakes. Ahhh, I'm in love.  Yummmmmmiasbkdjbaksjdb is about the closest I can describe my reaction to opening up the menu and seeing all of this deliciousness!  The décor here is super cute. Pink/white/black, loungey with lots of couch-like seating. Crisp, clean, and bright!  Service was SUPER friendly and knowledgeable. We were served fast, checked in on, given good recommendations, and when one of our party dared the server to order FOR him, she delivered an amazing chocolate peanut buttery treat! Well done!  I was lucky enough to sample the following (note many of the menu items have 80s songs names! Yes!):  Sugar Sugar - Cake Batter Cookie Dough ice cream topped with brownies, spin-made cookie dough pieces, and hot fudge on the side. If you weren't drooling reading that, take a look at the pictures. Ah-freaking-mazing. I'm a sucker for cake batter ice cream, and who can argue with cookie dough and brownies?! Served on a nice, fluffy waffle.  I Like it Like That - Chocolate Peanut Butter Ice Cream topped with Reese's mini peanut butter cups, bananas, and hot fudge on the side. Again, served on a waffle. Very yummy.  Some Cake I Can't For the Life Of Me Remember The Name Of: Chocolate mousse, pieces of cheesecake, topped with white and dark chocolate ganache. Really, really good if you're looking for something rich. We couldn't finish it all so we took it home and it kept well in the fridge and was still tres tasty as leftovers!  Mango smoothie: Good! Kind of pales in comparison to the giant waffle dishes, but still a decent smoothie.  Note: use that Yelp check-in offer!! 10% off your crepe and/or waffle order (they were also kind enough to apply it to an apple pie!) Woot!  Will I be back? Is that even a question that needs to be asked :)?"}
{"text":"We went for a spin today.  Well thank God it didn't turn out that way literally.  We ordered their version of veggie wraps. Well it was acceptable but wasn't impressive at all.  What stood out at Spin was their deserts menu and the decor.  I would definitely try them again for deserts."}
{"text":"Download Yelp on your phone and checkin to get 10% off!!   I can't say this is my top favorite dessert place, still think Dutch Dreams is better. But I really like some of their flavors. I got their May special, key lime flavored ice cream on waffle. It has the perfect balance of sweetness and tangy tartness. For people with a huge sweet tooth, try their white chocolate ice cream. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Been in here several of times when we crave for crepe and waffles. Its only because of the travel distance from our house that makes it easy for us to get desserts. This time I ordered crepe with fresh fruits, and asked for whipped cream. The server told me that it will be $1.25 extra, and I thought it would be a lot (or at least a decent amount) of whipped cream. When my plate came out, I was so disappointed since there were only 2 small scoops of the whipped cream. Seriously? This is a real rip-off! I really don't mind paying my dollars, but it was not worth it at all!  I wish I had taken a photo for you all to see how small they were!  I would not be back, just for this reason!"}
{"text":"It took a bit of trouble to find parking because they don't have their own private parking lot. So if you're planning to go you'll have to park in the Cineplex complex or the backstreet of the building that Spin is in.  Me and my boyfriend got to Spin just before it got busy so we didn't have to wait at all. We shared the sugar sugar crepe since the portions are big enough for two people. It took a while for it to come out but we had lots of time before our movie started.  It was presently very nicely and tasted pretty good...if only I had a sweet tooth. We couldn't finish it all because it was too sweet for us to handle. I guess the name \"sugar sugar\" was chosen wisely haha!  Overall, it's a pretty decent place to go on a date or hangout with friends."}
{"text":"Laid back environment, lots of chatter. Craving ice cream so my gfs and I decided to check out this place. Everything on any menu sounds good when you're hungry and Spin's menu had pictures, making it more difficult to choose. Decided on a waffle with strawberries, chocolate sauce, and we asked for pistachio ice cream to top everything off. That pistachio ice cream was deeelicious. Its made with whole fat cream, so waist line, beware--or just don't go too often!"}
{"text":"I will say that I have given Spin a fair chance to improve and I believe they have in the ways they have control over. The service has changed significantly for the better; knowledgeable and friendlier staff seem to be really speeding up service even with the high volume the location can recieve.  As a way to kill sometime before a show this is probably one of your better options in the area unless you want a full course meal. But for light snacking, desserts and drinks spin is a great spot to head to on your trip out to the movies on Queensway.  I am glad to see the postive changes and look forward to heading back for another delicious treat"}
{"text":"Went here to have the Savory Crepe's and dessert waffle. Honestly, it's pretty much what you expect, but nothing out of the ordinary. Can't say it's really worth the price...but our server was really nice and qe had a good experience. I would definitely recommend it if ur in the area, otherwise I would suggest Dunk n Dip on lakeshore...if u can get a seat."}
{"text":"We got the Oreo cake with pistachio ice cream. It was not good, at all. The only way I can describe the Oreo cake is with the word ... squished. It appeared as if it was melted and refrigerated again, then squished back into the shape of a slice of cake. And it was also stale.  When we got the ice cream, it was pretty much melted. In less than 5 minutes, it was like pistachio soup.  We had 2 bites of our dessert and left.  This place used to be packed. It was almost empty when we went. There were more people working. But they were all just talking and hanging out behind the counter. Long story short, never going back again!"}
{"text":"I suggested Spin Dessert Cafe for something sweet and as an alternative to just grabbing coffee at Starbucks or Timmy's.  We were seated right away and server was quick to take drink orders - green tea ($2.95) and decaf latte ($3.95).  We noticed the huge dessert portions so we decided to split the \"You Rock My World\" waffle - sticky toffee ice cream with Skor bits and caramel sauce ($10.95 for crepe version, add $0.95 for waffle upgrade).  Waffle was great and a good portion for sharing for two.  Decaf latte was meh and green tea was average.  Service was quite attentive and friendly.  Layout was bigger and spacious than the nearest Demetre's.  Tip for parking - There is Green P parking behind the restaurant/condo and if it's after 6pm or Sunday, it's free.  We didn't dare park in the LCBO lot for fear of being ticketed."}
{"text":"If this was just about my amazing Sundae this place would have gotten 5 stars but sadly bad service has reared its ugly head.  Lets see: 11:35pm- walked in, greeted by a hostess and shown our seats. She offered to go through the extensive menu with us and then left. \"September is banana month so we have a full page dedicated to bananas... sadly we've run out of bananas tonight... as well as strawberry ice cream!\" *great start*  11:40pm- Ready to place my order... no waitress to be found! This place is small, there is no reason why the service is so slow.  11:45pm- I plan on eating dessert people, and they close in 15 mins... my waitress needs to mozy!  11:50pm- Where the f*ck is my wai.... hostess comes over \"is everything ok?\" Yeah we'd like to order. I am in the middle of asking her a question about an unidentified dessert picture on the menu when she cuts me off and says here is your waitress. I point to the picture of fudge brownie and strawberry with ice cream and say I'd like that but since you are out of bananas I want strawberries and two lattes.  11:53pm- Food arrives (quicker than the service). The Sundae was amazing but my latte was meh!  midnight: We ask for the bill and notice a charge for strawberries... apparently what the hostess failed to mention was that the pictures are combinations of elements that cost extra!  Like I said the dessert here is wonderful but if this is how the service is all the time, I'll skip dessert thank you!"}
{"text":"As per my last review, only come here if you have time - do not come before a movie unless you're 2+ hours early, and that's for a party of 2-3. Service is a bit slow and they're usually understaffed.  The dessert here is REALLY good. They make their own ice cream and I have yet to find a flavour I don't like. I tend to order milkshakes or crepes from the monthly flavours menu, but the regular menu is just as good. The savoury crepes are also good. I have yet to try the pizza again though, and I don't think I will."}
{"text":"Cappuccino is very watered down. Definitely can tell it's push button coffee. Food was great and very generous with the portions. Was served by a very friendly waitress, black girl with beautiful long hair.  She was a lot of fun and very friendly. My bf and I both said how friendly she was :)"}
{"text":"Spin Dessert Cafe makes my head and brain spins!!   What should I have? Crepes? Waffles? Cakes? Ice Cream?  What flavours? What fruits?  Healthy choice or just indulge??  Hot or Cold Beverages?   I gave up as usual.. and let my Yelp Friend decide whatever.. as long as there are no raisins in them... not too hard right??   Then he started singing \"Staying Alive\" ($9).. a huge serving of ice cream wrapped in crepes and sprinkled with almonds and chocolate covered rice crisps. I was glad that someone is sharing that with me, as I won't be alive too long if I going to eat that all by myself.   The dessert though didn't really wow me, crepes itself was a little chewy and doughy... but sometimes food is not the only thing to make or break an experience. The services here was OK, the pinkish deco is feminine and cute (your sweetheart might like that) and what's better than sharing some sweets as a night cap to end the day or date??   Free WIFI just ask for the password!"}
{"text":"We waited 5 minutes to be greeted by an unfriendly, miserable hostess.  After sitting down, she didn't even notice the dirty table if i hadn't asked to be wiped down. Tables around me full of dirty dishes.  The first time i went to a spin location i had a delicious waffle and the service was amazing. This time i wanted to try a savoury crepe. Oh why.  I got the shrimp and chicken crepe with mushroom sauce. I don't think that was chicken. It was like a sponge. So gross. Ate it anyways.  It came with a caesar side salad which had rotten pieces of lettuce and just a bit of sauce couldn't even taste it.  I asked for another one and the second one also had rotten pieces of lettuce. Same exact thing.   So what I'm trying to say here is that dessert places should remain dessert places and leave the food for the restaurants. Saddest 44$ I've spent in my life.  2 stars for the raspberry italian soda."}
{"text":"Wow!! Packed, it was like 11pm when we came and luckily there was ONE last table for us. But it was probably their peak time at 11 because it got pretty empty as time went by.  We ordered the All Time Veggie crepe, sounded good on the menu but it tasted a bit odd... It was like weird cheese plus very small veggies.   The place was quite nice, busy though and the tables were sticky. Their ice cream was nothing amazing but are in large portions and is very very filling. Presentation of the desserts are just alright -not fantastic, just decent.  Other things that were also decent and not fantastic: - their coffee - service - atmosphere/vibe (it felt a little dirty: tables and floors were sticky, washrooms were gross)  Spin is a fun place to hang out if you're in the area. Don't take too much effort to come all the way here though!"}
