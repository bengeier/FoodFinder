{"text":"If given the option I would give zero stars.  Was seated right away but waited over 20 minutes before we left.  We were not offered drinks nor was our order taken.  The people that just sat down had their order taken right away.
I understand that this is a family restaurant and it was busy but still.
Food looked good but didn't have the chance to sample it."}
{"text":"The food was average in my opinion. I stopped by with some friends for an early lunch and the food came out fairly quick. The noodles were tasty but lots of onions for filler. There could've been more meat and shrimp in the noodle dishes. The cold noodle was refreshing on a hot day although the broth is usually more icy than just cold. The space is pretty big and it was pretty quiet at that time. They are kid friendly for families and have high chairs available. Don't expect a lot of service though because aside from taking our orders, dropping off the food and clearing the table they didn't stop by to check on us. Not sure if I would return given there are other options in the area."}
{"text":"My issue with jajangmyeon (Korean black bean noodles) is that despite the fact that they're delicious, they don't usually come with a lot of meat. Lu Chai solved that issue by topping it off with a huge (like size of my face huge) piece of Tonkotsu (deep fried pork cutlet) or Chicken Katsu (deep fried chicken cutlet).

The service was wonderful, seats were comfy, and the portions were gigantic! I could barely finish and I can eat A LOT. I'll be back for sure! 

Verdict:
4.5/5 - service 
4.5/5 - food 
4/5 - atmosphere 
Would I return: yes!"}
{"text":"We waited for almost 30 mins there until the dishes came to us. The noodles are too oily. The size of the dishes are large tho. The noodles we ordered can definitely feed 3 people. It's a Korean Chinese style noodle. Overall, I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"If you are coming for taste and qualityand not worrying about service and food wait time then this place is awesome. All the flavours were done well. They make a kimchi fried rice here( rare in Calgary) and its really tasty. Jjyangmen( black bean noodle) was also refreshing to eat. The noodles could have been more piping hot. Pork cutlet was super tasty and hot. Didnt taste like your ordinary Jap cutlet. Definitely coming back to try more of there huge menu"}
{"text":"Love the soup it is spicy and the crispy chicken was very good! We waited for quite some time but it was because there were a lot of customers"}
{"text":"Came here for an impromptu supper with friends. Atmosphere was pretty cozy. Service was a little lax at the beginning of the meal, but much improved the second half when another server showed up for us. 
Lots of interesting menu choices. Had such a hard time chooaing between tonkatsu and zhajang myun! Lucky they had a zhajang myun with tonkatsu so that made me happy :) the noodles were perfectly chewy, and the tonkatsu not overpriced or tough at all. As a group we also got the kanpungi to share. It was much spicier than we anticipated! 

Very tempted to go back and try their cream seafood champions on my next visit!"}
