{"text":"One of the best food carts in Madison, and much cheaper than some. The avocado spring rolls are great. If you order a dish spicy, it will be very spicy-- be prepared."}
{"text":"I saw all the great reviews on yelp, so decided to try their food today. I had an avocado spring roll and a pad thai. The roll was huge, which i liked; a ton of fresh veggies, which i liked; but the portion of avocado was just too small for the price, esp. Considering it is \"avocado\" roll. Pad thai tasted alright, not super good, but the price was good. However, some chicken pieces were not fully cooked. I hope it doesnt happen often."}
{"text":"I didn't realize the pork sausage was only available on Mondays (note-to-self). I went on a Wednesday or Thursday (I forget) and they did not have the pork sausage but recommended I try that day's special, the Spicy Chicken something. They were nice and substituted the regular rice for sticky rice (yum).   Overall, the chicken dish was spicy and tasted like a spicy curry. The sticky rice is always good. The vegetables were okay and I did not like the sweet peanut sauce on the veggies. I would probably order this again but I only come here on Mondays now :)"}
{"text":"Love this cart, I go at least once a week, so they know me and I don't even need to order..they already know what I always get.  The Squash Curry dish is great, and it is only $7.00.  The service is quick and friendly too!  The avocado spring rolls are also very good.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best food carts to be found in Library mall. The Pad Thai is just as spicy as you want it to be, the meals are always quick and affordable, and Thuy and Gui both are a joy to be around. Cant say enough good things about the service and food here."}
{"text":"Delicious!  We ordered the chicken squash curry. Great portion for $7. Friendly people. The avacado spring roll looks delicious. I would get that next time."}
{"text":"This food cart is my go to for lunch on campus. Not only is the food affordable, it is delicious! I've had the avocado spring roll, papaya salad with bbq chicken, pad thai, and salad. It's definitely a place I will continue to go to as long as I'm on campus. The lady is one of the nicest!"}
{"text":"Super nice! I go downtown just to eat here. The pad thai is awesome, u can get it super spicy. Spring rolls are great and inexpensive."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised I haven't written a review here yet, because I love coming to this cart.  They have really good curries and all are blasting with flavor, and at reasonable prices.  And they give you enough curry for the rice (so I've never felt like I haven't had enough curry to finish off the rice).  They also sell those giant burrito-sized spring rolls, which is great.  That (the spring roll) and the pad thai are great deals.  They give you a large take-away box of pad thai that definitely could last me two or three meals.  However, the noodles sometimes clump up together.  But the flavor is definitely there as well.  This cart is definitely my favorite Thai food cart on Library Mall."}
{"text":"Coming from a Lao family, this is where I go to get my fix when I'm feeling homesick or craving Lao food; I've been coming to this food cart for over four years now. The owner is extremely kind and will always greet you with a smile. There are daily specials in addition to the menu items that are available everyday.   My personal favorite dish is the mok pa, a daily specials item, which is a steamed catfish dish wrapped in banana leaves and lots of different fragrant herbs served over rice.    Today, I had the avocado spring roll, which for $3, is the cheapest, most nutritious, and filling meal you can get in downtown Madison. The vegetables always taste fresh and the peanut sauce complements the spring roll perfectly.  It's like having a burrito from Chipotle or Qdoba, but without the self-loathing afterwards. It never disappoints, and it's a great first dish to try if you've never had Lao food!"}
{"text":"Best pad thai in Madison and the owner is super friendly. She remembers what I like and we always have a have a nice little chat."}
{"text":"They're fast, cheaper than other comparable food carts, and the portions are big. I've only ordered the chicken pad thai, so I can only speak to that dish. If you're looking for super moist,  fresh chicken, this probably isn't the place for you. But, if you're in the mood for a large portion of flavorful (although a little bit overcooked) noodles, then check this place out! The employees have been nothing but friendly every time I've been, and I really appreciate their efficiency as I melt away in the muggy Madison heat. Like many Thai restaurants, you're also able to customize the level of spicy-ness (mild, medium, hot). I'm conditioned to like really spicy foods, and I think that the medium is actually a little weak. These noodles are a good introduction to pad thai for those that aren't thai food snobs, but it's by no means the best Madison has to offer."}
{"text":"I chose Luang Prabang out of the 20 or so food carts near the U of W mostly due to Yelp reviews (but partially because Laotian food sounded good). However, I had a fairly lackluster experience. They were out of most of their dishes already by 2:00, so I had a fairly limited selection (no spicy sausage, sadly). I chose the yellow curry, and it was just ok. The rice tasted and felt like it had been sitting a long time (very mushy), and the curry lacked pretty much any sort of vegetables despite the people there telling me there would be veggies in it - it was about 90% potatoes (I know, in the midwest they consider potatoes to be a vegetable, but they really aren't). I'll definitely come back to try out the spicy sausage, as it gets rave reviews here, but if they are out of it (and they told me they usually sell out by noon or 1pm), you should skip this place and pick another cart."}
{"text":"My favorite food cart on Library Mall. The spring rolls are massive, fresh, and cheap. I have mostly only gotten the spring rolls but after seeing my co-worker repeatedly get the catfish every Tuesday, I decided to order that one Tuesday. I was not disappointed! For $7, you get a heaping portion of steamed catfish, along with a generous scoop of either white or sticky rice, and steamed veggies. It's topped with a delicious green chile sauce that really just ties everything together. For the price, it's a real steal because I could definitely see this dish costing $10-13 in a restaurant. She only has this special on Tuesday though.   The lady who runs the cart is also very friendly and always greets me with a smile. I am so glad this cart exists and I am eager to branch out of my spring roll ways (though they're so good, I can never resist not getting them!) and try the pad thai and other offerings in the future."}
{"text":"Best place to grab laotion/thai food if your on library mall. Food is worth the price and you'll leave satisfied! The owner is super nice as well and will always remember her returning customers."}
{"text":"How can you not like this food cart? The cook here is the friendliest among all the food carts at Library Mall, and every single person I watched ordering here know Kai by name and obviously, she knew them by name too.   Food - cheap and large portions. Haven't found anything I do not like here, but I usually order the same few favorites.  (Monday special) Laotian sausage. The sausage and the sticky rice is the perfect combination, you just keep going back.  Khao Moo Deng - pork with fried sticky rice and super tasty avocado salad. Really good. The pork is like chinese BBQ pork (Char siew), and tender and great flavor. I'm not sure what they put in the sticky rice, but its brown instead of white and so much tastier! Mango sticky rice - mangos are always sweet. Rice, the last time I had it, was more like a pudding, but still tasty sweet and sticky like you would want it. Avocado spring roll - favorite among most people I watched ordering, and you can request for not ordering certain things in there. Pad Thai - very very very tasty. the best you can get in Madison.   I love the food cart so much, I will brave the Bascom Hill back and forth just so I can get some tasty Thai food. Good service, good food, cheap and large portions - what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"The $3 avocado chicken spring rolls are amazing. I came here every day monday-friday last week to get a spring roll and loved it every time. You get such a large spring roll for only $3.They are so flavorful and filling. The man working at the cart is so friendly. I cannot get enough of these spring rolls!! Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The $3 avocado spring roll is a lunch and a half (they did raise the price fifty cents from the former $2.50)! It's the size of a Chipotle burrito and packed full of fresh veggies. I always order medium spice and find that it tends to vary a fair amount. But aside from that, it's the best Library Mall Food Cart deal you can find. The staff are speedy and super friendly too!"}
{"text":"Best Food truck in Madison. The squash curry is an absolute favorite - though chili sauce once made me give up on 5/6 eaten spring roll. Whenever I walk by the food trucks during lunch time, I have my eyes set on Thai food and nothing else tempts me: not the line of healthy people dressed in running gear waiting to get a smoothie and a spring roll, not the adorable fluffs of pink smoke around the buns, not the fiery decoration around bulgoggi burritos. Nothing. Squash curry has your vote and you know it."}
{"text":"Great food cart for a cheap and delicious lunch! The same spring rolls from fresh fruit juice are here. We love the Pad Thai. It packs quite a kick. So does the beef larb. The beef massman curry is my favorite! Peanuty and meaty!"}
{"text":"This is a really amazing foodcart on State Street. I've had two dishes here and they were delicious. The papaya salad with chicken and sticky rice was tangy and refreshing. I had mine with BBQ pork because they had not enough chicken remaining, and actually prefer it that way. They also have these giant avocado spring rolls (see photo for scale!) for only $3.00!! Perfect, healthy, cheap lunch on a summer's day. You can also add meat to the spring rolls for the same price! A tip though- their food can be really spicy. I am quite tolerant of spicy (hot) food, but even their mild was too hot for me in the papaya salad. Their customer service is excellent. The guy and lady are so cheerful and friendly, it is like they really enjoy what they do and their customers. Once when they ran out of a dish I wanted, they gave suggestions, and even samples to help me choose another dish."}
{"text":"This little food stand dishes out some of the best food you can get. Everything I have ordered has been great. If you are lucky enough, try the boneless (she actually de-bones a chicken wing) stuffed chicken wing special when available. Larp Beef is amazing. The spring rolls are a great on the go lunch. I cannot say enough about this stand, fast, friendly, delicious."}
{"text":"I was tired of eating sandwiches for lunch and I decided to look around for something new. Found this little gem sitting right on library mall. Tbh, I have only tried the avocado spring roll. It's healthy, huge, cheap and best of it all, it tastes amazing. They add nuts, so inform them beforehand if you have an allergy. I'm surprised I've spent two years in Madison without having found them. I'm not going to add a picture to this post as I already have run through the roll, but you get the picture."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Pad Thai & Squash curry. They are both amazing. Spring rolls are alright but it gets too messy when u eat em. I wish they make it as two smaller ones instead."}
{"text":"I love this Aunty. I would go to her food cart every thursdays after classes. She always greeted me with a smile and it was a very refreshing sight after a horrible day. Anyways, the value for the food you get is phenomenal, honestly sometimes I feel like I'm stealing because the value is that great. Anyways for those who do not know what to get. Get Kha Moo Deng, you can thank me later. (Side note get mild or no spice, Thai people chili is lethal)"}
{"text":"AVOCADO SPRING ROLL. For $2.50 it's a steal that you get essentially a large burrito of avocado-y, cabbage-y, spicy, peanut saucy goodness with mint and noodles bundled in a rice wrapper. This is my go-to grab on Library Mall for something veggie-filled and cheap on the go. Sometimes I go over there just for the spring roll actually."}
{"text":"No use repeating what's already been said, yet I'll do it anyway!  Avocado Spring Roll. Get it. Only $2.50? Get 2? OK!  Huge. Delicious. Avocado-y. Avocado makes everything better."}
{"text":"This is my Favorite food cart in library mall!!! And this is a lot since library mall is filled with amazing food carts. I however love all of the food this cart offers. Their curries are to die for, and wow their spring rolls are cheap and fresh and amazing. You can customize how spicy you want the spring rolls which I love, and I've met people with peanut allergies and they accommodate to put differs sauces. The people working in the cart are always so friendly, even when the lines are insane, and they are usually one of the last carts to leave which is great for us people who might not have time to go during lunch. Anyways, I just love this cart, the food, and the service!"}
{"text":"Best food cart in town. I used to go all the time as an undergrad. Still dream about! Best freakin papaya salad ever! Perfectly spicy! And the service is phenomenal ! The lady still remembers me every time I come back!!!"}
{"text":"Ka's review was an inspirational delight to try an avocado spring roll, though ill disagree and say the lady who runs slide is the nicest food cart operator :)  A lady in front of me ordered a spring roll when I pranced up to the window and the woman inside inquired if I wanted one also, yes please, I would like two. Two rolls are placed in front of the girl and I and off she goes with one of them. The woman asks the girl behind me if she would like a spring roll, spicy or regular?   Woah spicy is an option. Rad. I ask her if I may have another roll and could it be spicy please. She placed the rolls in bags and with some sauce to put with the non spicy one.   Oooooh the peanut and hot sauce tantalize the crunchy goodness within.   2 goals for the school year: do all of the readings before class and TRY not to buy one of these delicious harmonious delights every day."}
{"text":"The pad thai is usually my go-to dish when benchmarking a Thai restaurant (or in this case, food cart), and I am sad to say that the Luang Prabang pad thai is extremely underwhelming.  Although the flavor was okay, the noodles were overcooked, resulting in sad, limp clumps at the bottom of my take-out box. The chicken was also way too dry. The only real thing that Lunag Prabang has going for it is their prices, which undercuts their competitors by $2-3 per entree.   I may be back on a whim to try out the avocado spring roll, but that remains to be seen."}
{"text":"I hate to open up a business listing with a mediocre review, but so it goes. Luang Prabang dishes up inexpensive Thai food in large portions, and that ultimately means shortcuts. Consistent with that expectation, my dish was pretty forgettable. Friendly service, low prices, and a smile could not make up for chopped rice noodles in red curry paste dressed up to look like Pad Thai."}
{"text":"Izzy D pretty much has it covered, but I'll reiterate anyway. This little food cart has the most amazing burrito-sized avocado spring roll! For $2.50!!! When is the last time you ate lunch out for $2.50?!?!  Yes, it has no meat in it, but I have taken many a carnivore to get a spring roll here and every one of them has loved it. Next time you're at Library Mall and don't feel like waiting in the endless line for Banzo, go get yourself a spring roll at Luang Prabang. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.  The only reason this isn't a 5-star review is that I've never tried anything else at this cart, so I have no idea how anything else is. I've been here a bazillion times and can't get myself to try something other than the awesome avocado spring roll."}
{"text":"I literally come from Milwaukee to eat here. It's the best pad Thai I've ever had. I recommend medium spicy. Both the chicken and tofu are great. Also, you can get GIGANTIC avocado spring rolls. The pad Thai is FIVE DOLLARS and the spring rolls are only $3. I ate here constantly when I went to school in Madison and I hope it never closes because I'm gonna be going there as long as I possibly can lol."}
