{"text":"I like the spinach Bleu and Blue salad w grilled chicken. It is very light and and all fresh. The carrot cake is from a bakery and was ok. Beer is $5 so plan on $30 for a meal."}
{"text":"The food is just \"okay\" for dinner.  The breakfast buffet the following morning was \"okay\" too.  The worst part was the service.  The waitresses were just not very attentive during both dining experiences."}
{"text":"If you live anywhere on the West or East coasts, it's a pretty sure bet that the food in the midwest will be sub par to anything you'll receive back home.   That being said, after several days of miserable convention center food for a recent conference, Hemispheres offered a decent/tolerable level of culinary distinction for Ohio.   Okay, Okay! I know there are gourmet restaurants and chefs in Cleveland and Cincinnati. Unfortunately I could not not get to any of those and the choices where I was at the time was Burger King down the street or the hotel restaurant.   So Hemispheres features an extensive and well-rounded menu with lots of apps, a few salads, burgers, pastas, meat and potatoes, of course, and a one-page drink menu.  The dinner salad with my gardenburger replenished my need for greenery and roughage. The bowl came filled with arugula, baby spinach, etc. Very good. The gardenburger tasted fine. The bun kind of soggy. But hey...a big step up from the rest of the days' fare.   Service was friendly and attentive and their bar got PACKED on Saturday night."}
{"text":"We were hesitant to try Hemispheres after reading the Yelp reviews, but our laziness got the better of us (we're staying at the Sheraton) so we ate dinner there (Saturday night, 7:45 PM). There were only 3 other tables populated, so it was nice and quiet. The menu is new as of this month (perhaps less extensive than described in reviews below) and has a section for locally-sourced foods. I had the Lake Erie Wahoo over risotto and my wife had the chopped chicken salad. My dinner was excellent - the large portion of fish was cooked properly and tasted fresh, the risotto was rich but not overpowering, and the broccolini was not overcooked--5 stars. My wife's salad was okay - multiple greens but more romaine than others, and the romaine looked and tasted like it has been in the refrigerator too long. It was probably just too cold, because by the time she was half-way through, it was significantly better, but the salad was \"average.\"  For dessert I had their house-made Peanut Butter Cheesecake, which was a generous slice, not bland but not so rich I felt bad finishing it. My wife, who has many food intolerances, saw nothing on the dessert menu she could eat, so our waitress suggested a bowl of cut-up fruit which was fresh and good. Our waitress was very nice, attentive, and helpful and improved the experience. Were we in the Cleveland Airport area again, we'd be comfortable eating at Hemispheres."}
{"text":"We ate here three times in three days.    Sometimes we had 5 with us - sometimes 8  Once for dinner and twice for breakfast   Every time we order - the waitress would come back and say - we are out of that. Like - soup, strawberrys, blueberries, etc  At dinner a portion of the meal was forgotten - salmon   Breakfast was always cold   But the staff was always very friendly.   We always loved the staff.  Just have bad feelings about the kitchen    We could have gone to other restaurants- but it was convenient   Unless we had to stay at the hotel again - we would not eat here again. Sorry."}
{"text":"After a 3rd cancelled flight --I started in MKE enroute to EWR i decided to jump in the Sheraton shuttle to grab dinner. And rooms here but I figured the food likely better than the Holiday in where I could book accommodations.  Waitress took a long time to take my drink order and then disappeared for another  long stretch while nearby tables ordered and rec'd their appetizers.   Tomato and mozzarella appetizer: tomatoes bland of color and flavor. Too much balsamic glaze and not enough olive oil.   Sautéed chicken and broccoli with Thai red curry sauce. sautéed? This was over-grilled chicken, sliced, with a curried broth (which wasn't bad) poured over it. Rice, and some sliced bell peppers and onions. 4 steamed broccoli florets on top added like an afterthought.   Great Lakes Burning Lake IPA: 75/100  Cost with tip was $45  Should have headed to the Holiday Inn. Could have bought an equally poor meal there for less.  --Thomas"}
{"text":"My mom and daughter and husband came to eat, my daughter had salmon (loved it) hubby had meatloaf (loved it) mom had a steak (liked it) me I had a cheese burger (13 dollar burger) my stomach was already giving me trouble so after running to the potty 3 times I decided just to nibble the yummy juicy dill pickle spear and box it the rest and come home. Once home and settled down I nuked it for 1 min for the burger and fries... fries bland (no salt) and my burger was burnt on one side but cooked *medium well* does not mean burnt. I gave the burger to the dogs. And this place is not cheap either. The soup alone is 6 dollars.... it's crazy expensive. But the staff is amazing! They are warm and welcoming but the kitchen needs a visit from Gordon Ramsey.   Breakfasts- again not cheap, the buffet is 14 dollars! Hopefully your hungry for unsalted food. Chocolate Milk is dairy mans so there's a plus. Orange juice is yummy (duh) but unless my moms (multi millionaire) is paying not coming back at all!"}
{"text":"I stayed when they had their grand re-opening and was amazed. The party was huge with martinis and great food from all around the world. Best part I won a free dinner for two and used it right away. The food was pretty good. The steak as good and the desert and app are really good. They have a good breakfast buffet too."}
{"text":"The drinks are well made, but on the pricey side for the location. The bar is convenient when staying here since there is nothing but the airport nearby. The bartenders are very friendly. Beer selection is decent with a few local brews. Mixed drinks are well made but pricey."}
{"text":"I was disappointed by my experience at this restaurant; I had expected better from a Sheraton. The name of the restaurant was promising, but the food did not live up to it. I dined here a few times because of long, on-site training days plus my on-site lodging. My first morning there I tried a veggie omelet, which was the standard fine. The next morning I opted for the all-you-can-eat breakfast buffet, which I would say is comparable to complimentary continental breakfast at perhaps other hotels (not fine dining, nothing too special). The lunch/dinner menu is not really vegetarian-friendly at all. During a lunch break on one of the training days, I perused the menu, but nothing veggie except maybe for soup and salad. After a long training day in desperation I did decide to go for the soup-and-salad combo for dinner - all standard, nothing special. I think my table was overlooked because none of the servers helped me out, so I had to get someone's attention at the bar to get some service. Not a good night. On my last night there I decided to venture out into town on the train since the station is fairly convenient at the nearby airport. I would not recommend this place for dining unless for convenience/desperation."}
{"text":"Hotel bars are not typically my thing, I like to venture out for my drinking and dining pleasures.  Turned out the rain was never ending and we wanted a few libations to see if we could wait for the rain to stop before heading out to dinner.    We were only here for drinks and snack mix, no dinner.  They delivered a solid performance on both.  Drinks were average and were refilled well before I ever took my last sip.  Bartender was friendly and I enjoyed listening to the BF chat with her about Ohio then and now.    Decent bar to grab a drink before a meal.  It's only 15 minutes into the city, I recommend trying someplace local for dinner."}
{"text":"This place is located in the Cleveland airport Sheraton hotel. I ate here when I was in town for a conference at the hotel (which is another story in itself). Since the whether was bad and we had few choices being forced to stay at the hotel all weekend, we ate here twice. This place gets the job done if, like us, you have no other choice. However, if you have the luxury of dining elsewhere, I suggest you choose one of the many other options nearby.   The place itself is clean and staff is friendly. There is a bar which we did not use but looked sufficient enough. However, I was so off put by my meal that I can't recommend this place.    I decided to start my meal with the black bean soup. It was halfway decent with flavor but basically was a bowl of beans. Fortunately, I like black and was very hungry. The real problem was my entree. I ordered the turkey avocado wrap with edamame aioli. I was so hungry and they made this sound delicious. I was so disappointed when it arrived and had a large amount of bacon bits on it which were impossible to remove. There was no mention of bacon anywhere in the description and the bacon was a major part of the wrap. Also, I found nothing resembling avocado which was in the name. There was some sort of green paste which I can only assume was the aioli, but this too was so underwhelming. I really could make a better sandwich at home.   For my second visit, I had pizza with pineapple and it was actually good so if you are forced to eat here, go with the pizza!   Overall, my advice is to be cautious! The description of my meal was horribly inaccurate which I found very disappointing. I would eat elsewhere if you have a chance. I think you can find better options nearby."}
{"text":"Good food and wait staff at Hemispheres at the Sheraton.  I enjoyed their Ahi tuna with a few samples of favorites from Great Lakes Brewing."}
{"text":"I ate here two nights in a row - the first night was a 3 and the second was a 4, so keep that in mind.  The staff are lovely - very warm and friendly and helpful.  The first night I had the roast chicken, thinking it was a healthy choice.  It came with a crust that suggested fried rather than roasted, and the chicken itself was a bit dry.  The brussel sprouts were ok, the potato wedges were limp.  The chocolate ice cream was excellent (both nights).  The second night I had the skirt steak and that was really, really good.  Tasty, cooked perfectly - still pink, and the potato wedge fries were excellent as well.  The atmosphere is nothing special, but the friendliness of the staff goes a long way in helping guests relax and enjoy their meal."}
{"text":"This is the official hotel bar and restaurant of the Sheraton located on the property of the Cleveland airport. I can on a Saturday during the Kate morning and I was able to order both lunch or dinner. Being a health-conscious person, I appreciated the many healthy options on the breakfast menu. I was not tempted by a list of meat-based, greasy options -- which is good since I want to cheat while in vacation. The service was extremely fast and the waitresses checked on us every 10 to 15 minutes."}
