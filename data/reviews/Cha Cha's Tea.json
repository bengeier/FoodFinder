{"text":"Cute tea house in the heart of Grade Ave!  

We were greeted right away with warm smiles! I'm not sure if we had a lost looks on our face but the woman at the register seemed to sense it and was very helpful! She showed us thru the menu, chit chatted with us, and even answered a few questions we had. They have different varieties of tea which is, of course expected at a tea house. There were pictures of the loose leaf teas that you can purchase in bulk which I thought was really nice. Also the drinks were very descriptive so you understood what you were getting and even when we had questions about a certain blend the employees would try to best explain how it taste and even made recommendations! 

My family and I ordered: Chai tea with almond milk, London Fog with almond milk, CacTea, and a Genmaicha Latte all iced! Okay so can I just talk about their chai for a bit?! It is so UNIQUE! It is a concentrated version that they make themselves! My mom got only a little bit  because she didn't really like too much spice so it was more milky but still a subtle hint of that gingery spice. I like more spicy so next time I go I'll have to try their chai how it's meant to be! The London Fog was pretty tasty! The Genmaicha was recommended to us because we were wondering how the toasted rice would taste like and the woman up front said the flavor is similar to a rice krispy, but to me it tasted like Chex. MY drink happened to be my favorite! The CacTea, the name alone just speaks to me on a spiritual level. It was very floral which I enjoyed and I asked for it with honey to give it a hint of sweetness. It was perfection!  Unfortunately I only got a flight of iced teas, but I will definitely be back to try theirs hot teas!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, excellent tea. I really enjoyed this place and Ashley had a wealth of knowledge, she explained all the differences between the teas and provided great insight and helped us pick out some great quality tea which is definitely a rarity in Phoenix! I will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to find this gem while waiting for our reservation time at the Barrio Cafe Gran Reserva. I had the Moroccan Mint Tea and highly recommend it- a perfect balance of mint, gunpowder green tea, and sweetness. Delicious! I love being able to taste each ingredient individually and as one recipe (a sign of good ingredients and craftsmanship). My husband had a green tea from Taiwan that he greatly enjoyed. Lastly, the atmosphere was comfortable and modern and the owners were wonderfully nice and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"The owner, Ashley, has taken her 15+ years in the tea industry and created something special in downtown Phoenix -- a tea-person's paradise! It's a casual, comfortable, and cool space with an incredible offering of pure teas, herbal blends, and hand-crafted third wave tea concoctions. There are munchies, quiche, and retail offerings, extended hours, great local businesses in around the Desert Sun Plaza, and good vibes along the historic Grand Avenue~

I can't get enough of this place, so much so that I can now be found on both sides of the counter as a tea-drinker AND tea-tender~"}
{"text":"Wow - what a great new addition to the neighborhood!  We stopped in yesterday and ordered a peaches and cream tea latte to enjoy out front with our dog.  The staff is beyond friendly and helpful, the place is super cute with plenty of parking and the tea was some of the best I have ever tasted.  I can't wait to come back and try some more additional tasty options!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best tea in Phoenix. I've had Chai at dozens of other places in the valley and the Spiced Chai here is the undisputed champ. Amazing product, great atmosphere, and an owner whose passion for her product translates into the highest quality authentic tea lineup in Arizona. The Grand Avenue Arts district has managed to land yet another amazing specialty shop that's taking craft and quality to another level. Simply put, this place is not to be missed.

{"text":"Awesome tea spot with an awesome owner who truly loves and knows tea! She knows the proper technique of making the tea. The owner gave us a sample of the popular mint tea and it was absolutely delicious. I got the golden milk and it was perfect. She even had coffee available for any non tea drinkers. An added touch that I absolutely we loved was that she uses compostable cups and lids!"}

{"text":"Ashley is amazing! Great selection of loose leaf tea at a modest price, makes everything fresh in front of you great ambiance and music in the lounge!

Always worth the drive i believe they are occasionally open late on the weekends till midnight.

I go to Cha Cha's about once a week for my loose leaf tea, my most recent purchase was Fancy Earl Grey & Ti Kuan Yin Oolong."}
