{"text":"Quick delivery, really nice staff. Calzones are good. Pizzas are better (try the Calzone Special). Get the garlic bread. It's simple but delicious."}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza I've had in the west so far. I had the calzone special and was moaning after every bite. I'm actually eating a piece mmmm right mmmmm now ooohhh YES YES YES!! For the person below, that is the delivery driver's spot. The parking area is small and usually packed. A shame you're not going to try their pizza, it's your loss not the delivery drivers..."}
{"text":"La pizza toute garnie avec extra pepperonies est délicieuse. Une bonne place pour le \"take out\""}
{"text":"Great pizza. We ordered the meat lovers.. Service was a bit slow but I guess it does take enough time to cook a pizza. Tasted great though. Poutine was more of a 3 star on one."}
{"text":"I ordered from Calzones the other day and had a COMPLETELY different experience! I had a vege calzone again and it was amazing! Full of flavour and super fresh. My husband's chicken salad was pretty good too. Delivery is great, food is great! Can't wait to order again!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and submarine! I highly recommend their Calzone Special pizza or Steak+ submarine, prepared on order with fresh ingredients. The place is very small and cafeteria-style, best to order or use their free delivery for groups. Perfect for quick lunch when you need your Italian fix."}
{"text":"Hands down best bang for your buck for quick delivery in the west.  Great selection fresh ingredients good size calzones and its delicious.  Thrown out all your west island pizza flyers and tell people about this place.  Would have been 5 stars but their delivery area is limited which sucks."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Calzones and Pizza.   The large poutine is huge, 4 of us couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"Meilleur restaurant de livraison à vie.  Les ingrédients sont frais et le plat ne sont pas plus gras qu'il ne le devrait, au contraire. Ça goûte la bouffe maison. C'est près de mon travail et j'ai essayé presque tous les repas du menu au cours des 15 dernières années. La qualité de leur nourriture ne change jamais. Dans le style de resto, il ne se fait pas mieux (j'ai habité Rosemont, le Plateau, Côte-St-Paul, Pierrefond).  Les gens au téléphone sont très courtois et accommodant. La livraison est rapide et les livreurs sont courtois."}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken calzone and steak sub for takeout. The chicken calzone was ok nothing special and the sub was average, kinda disappointed that the sub brwasn't toasted like at subway."}
{"text":"Great pizza on West Island, my personal favourite is spicy Mexican, or vegetarian deluxe as an alternative. Also fantastic service, friendly people"}
{"text":"Good service. Clean restaurant. Food is bland and overpriced. I ordered the ricotta and spinach calzone with a salad and drink and the total came to over $16. The filling was lacking seasoning. The crust was nice but overall I would return."}
{"text":"Such hearty calzones - what's not to love. This is a snug joint in West Island with speedy service and piping hot, well-stuffed calzones. I got the spinach and ricotta one (trying to be healthy) but hubby's steak one was infinitely better."}
{"text":"Came here and enjoyed a great calzone! They deserve the name that's for sure. Menu is up on the wall (impossible to miss) and I went with their meatlover one and it was really good. Thry also have pizzas and subs. Wished I lived nearby!!!  Price tag for the calzone and a drink is about 15$ which I fiund is a little high but you do get solid value here.   Their business caters between delivery/takeout but you have about 20 seats in the tiny resto.  Would totally be back!!!"}
{"text":"Well...3.7 stars.   Just ok tasting. .but nice cheese and meat ratio and good crust. But put it all together and still bland.   People are nice. Pizza looked fantastic. Just zero taste. I went all the way there on recommendation. Oh well"}
{"text":"Great pizzas and calzones. Quick service and good menu. I order... shop at IGA then pick up the finished pizzas and enjoy at home."}
