{"text":"I don't know if it was an off day, or if I just liked this place in college because I had no taste buds after a long day of drinking. This place has nothing on Chipoltle. The chicken was dry, salsa had no kick, and rice has no flavor."}
{"text":"Skip chipotle, go to Qdoba!!  Get their chips and queso, you will never regret it. This place puts their hairy hippies at Chipotle to shame. Don't be a hipster, go to Qdoba and enjoy."}
{"text":"I walked into a restaurant with trash on the floors in the dining area and a girl with a big hickey on her neck sweeping a lot of garbage behind the counter. An older woman came out and was one of the most unhelpful and rude people I've ever met. I left and I'll never return. Very poorly run establishment."}
{"text":"Food was good, albeit slowly made. Qdobas are a solid \"almost Chipotle\", and is a good substitute for when you can't find said Chipotle."}
{"text":"Man I love Chipot--I mean Qdoba. Last time I was here I was stopping with co-workers and wasn't starving, so all I got was the chips and queso. Delicious, expect the mountains of salt on the chips. Moderation, people, moderation."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Qdoba. The place was pretty empty right off the bat, so bad sign there. Decided to go with the grilled vegetable burrito with black beans, brown rice, habanero salsa and guacamole.   The first thing I didn't like was that the same employee who was preparing food was also ringing up customers. This is *never* acceptable. I don't care if you put gloves on, you shouldn't have an employee handling both currency and food. It's disgusting. Where was the manager?   Secondly, my burrito was poorly wrapped. I ended up with more of a sphere than a cylinder. Furthermore, the foil didn't cover the burrito, so of course it fell apart as I ate.  Thirdly, I didn't order any dairy (lactose intolerant) but there was definitely a taste of sour cream in my food. Not sure if it was some sour cream that got spilled on the lettuce (noticed that on the line) or if sour cream was added to the guacamole to stretch the amount, or if that's just how Qdoba's food tastes. Concerning to say the least, but at least I didn't get sick.  Finally, the thing that bothered me the most, was that the food was SO, so oily. My mouth was coated with oil for an hour afterwards. I can only assume the oil was from the grilled vegetables, but it could have been from something else. Truly, I don't mind cooking with a lot of oil but this was over the top. I almost get the feeling they had an accident and drenched the veggies by mistake. You really don't need much if any oil to cook zucchini and squash. The water will release and keep from sticking.  The grilled vegetables were the thing I was most excited about at Qdoba, but quickly became the aspect I liked the least.  TL;DR oily food, poorly wrapped, gross handling practice.   2/5 will not return."}
{"text":"We went last nite it was empty no one else there.. They girl serving the food was pretty rude no smile or eye contact.. I got a bowl and a burrito .. She was so skimpy with everything never had the happen before. She seemed rushed. I ask for salsa and she gave me one little side for both of us. Got chips and queso usually I get it to go but seemed like 1/2 order of chips .. .. They forgot to give me cup for soda had to ask them and she was just blunt.. And you get free guacamole she barely put any .. There was veryyy little guacamole on our food literally.she fill up the spoon dump half of it and put it on my food .. Very disappointed.. No customer service what so ever... I had a free meal voucher showed it to the employee in advance and maybe the was the problem.. My.bowl was 1/2 empty and no.guac...After all it was free.... Cashier was nice ... Burrito was pretty much a taco bell burrito just tortilla ....."}
{"text":"Standard variety huge burrito joint in the vein of Moe's and Chipotle.  I like this one quite a bit.  Favorites include: Ancho Chili burrito, Poblano Pesto burrito, and the steak tacos.  Nice outdoor seating and a great place to take kids."}
{"text":"The first time I went here, I got the shredded beef burrito ($6.29) and thought it was just ok (it was HUGE).  However, I LOVED their warm chips ($.99) and guacamole ($2.69)!    Although I've revisited this location, I haven't tried anything else off their menu...I just run in for an order of chips and guacamole.  My mouth is watering just thinking about the lightly salted chips and tangy guac.  BTW, although I prefer Qdoba's chips, for burritos, I prefer Baja Fresh.  As others have mentioned, Qdoba is just like Chipotle.  It's even located across the street from Chipotle...go figure."}
{"text":"These guys were amazing!  We had an 11 month baby with us, and they helped us take our food to our seats as well as getting us a little bowl of rice and beans for the little guy.  The food was fantastic, and only surpassed by their incredible customer service. This was truly a \"WOW!\" experience"}
{"text":"great food, much better than chipotle.  much fresher flavor.  staff is always happy and smiling. recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"Chipotle imitation. The queso on he burrito was good but I did not enjoy the rice or the  beans. Lacked a certain flavor I like in burritos"}
{"text":"Qdoba, Chipotle, and Costa Vida, are all very similar and provide the \"Subway experience\" with Mexican food. What sets Qdoba apart is that they incorporated some outstanding sauces into their food which give you more options. Instead of having a chicken burrito, you can have a Ancho Chili BBQ Chicken Burrito, or a Spicy Quesso Chicken Burrito. There food is great and the menu gives you a lot more options than Chipotle does."}
{"text":"I frequent this Qdoba pretty much every day during the work week. It's within walking distance of my work so it is super convenient. The staff are very friendly all the time and the food is amazing! I usually get steak tacos or the 3 cheese nachos and I am never disappointed!"}
{"text":"If you're coming in here for a burrito, you're better off walking that extra block and getting one at Chipotle."}
{"text":"I only stick to the tacos because I'm not into the monster burrito stuff. They do have some of the best shredded beef and it's great in their tacos and taco salad.   The one thing that sets this place apart from the rest(besides the great meat) - the salsa.  Their Habanero salsa is outstanding - tasty and spicy."}
{"text":"If Taco Bell is the Wal-Mart of mexican food, then Qdoba is the Target.  I agree with other reviewers that there's nothing that stands out here, but it's not hideous either.  Standard 'office lunch' fare."}
{"text":"The only thing I tried here was the vegetarian Taco Salad. I like the crunchy shell. Fresh ingredients. lettuce, dressing, black beans, sour cream, tomato salsa, red salsa, corn. It fills me up for at least 3-4 hours. I usually get a to go box for it, but when I'm really hungry I eat the whole thing... people wow at how such a petite gal could chow down the whole thing. Its called being hungry.  I really wish they had the smoked chiplote tabasco sauce here cuz it would really go well with my taco salad. (yes, I'm a chipotle addict and decided to give this place a try :p)"}
{"text":"My daughter and I LOVE to go to this Qdoba... the service is usually great.  We have even ordered catering for a party at out house from this location, and it was a huge hit!"}
{"text":"Went back today because I live close.  I had a much different experience this time around.  One of the employees, I'm assuming the manager or shift supervisor, was seriously on his A-Game.   Dude takes pride in his job, and was helping out the other workers.  He actually re-steamed my tortilla because a different employee didn't do it right.  Usually don't see that kind of pride in work at fast food chains.  Really impressed.  This place may have turned a corner with this supervisor running things (think he's a supervisor)."}
{"text":"Let me start this off by saying that I love q'doba, the food is delicious. Reason for 2 stars you ask? Well I'm currently standing in line, I'm the only one here. I was greeted with \"I'll be right with you\" and then I waited while the two ladies here finished their conversation! So while the food is great, this experience was not!"}
{"text":"Qdoba is a chain of restaurants that serves fast, fresh Mexican-inspired food.  As a vegetarian, this is about as close to Mexican food as I can get.    If you are familiar with Chipotle, then you understand the set-up here: basically, a grown-up cafeteria where you pick the fillings for your burrito or tacos and they build it for you.  There's usually a high turn-over so things stay fresh.  Also, expect large portions at affordable prices.  I hadn't been to Qdoba in a while and couldn't remember why.  After a recent visit back, it all came back to me.  The food was pretty boring.  Not a lot of flavor- not from the rice, the beans, the salsas.  Not bad, just not exciting to eat.  I think I'm going to stick to Zaba's.  Bonus points for coupons, a frequent diner program, a clean store, and friendly employees."}
{"text":"It's Qdoba Not Adobe By The Rue  Qdoba, let me start by asking a question of you, How in the hell does Chipotle not sue? Your indgredients are exactly the same, The menu board is different but it's still lame.  I decided to go with the queso burro, Chicken for my meat it was so-so, Add the black beans and some rice, Asked if I want cheese I didn't think twice,  Added the hottest sauce and sour cream, Did Chipotle change their name or is this just a dream? Iced tea was the drink that I decided to pick, The only thing about this place that will stick.  The final price for my food and a drink, Was $9.78, yes that does stink, Nearly ten bucks flushed down the drain, Just go to Chipotle it tastes the same.  I've never been here before so I can't be upset, At not knowing what it was all about just yet, Now I know and next time will remember, That for lunch this place isn't a contender.   BONG!!  ."}
{"text":"Quite simply the worst mexican fast food around unless your idea of a burrito is a bowl of rice in a tortilla. I don't see anything here being better than taco bell, just more expensive.  If you already know the food qdoba offers but haven't been to this location, be warned that the people working here don't care at all about what they are doing. One time I visited there was a mushroom growing out of the wall next to a booth. When staff finally saw what I saw, they started taking pictures rather than make it go away.  I won't be returning here. There is a Mexican restaurant about two blocks away called Emiliano's that is good. It is not fast food, but I'm sure if you call in an order, it will be done just as quickly. I'm yet to find a Mexican restaurant that makes you wait for food."}
{"text":"Rice was crunchy, beans were blah & the steak had a funny taste to it.  The highlight of the visit was the queso.  Bummer!  I was hoping they were good."}
{"text":"Be prepared to be insulted by an employee Harrison.  He insulted my sister.  Completely unprofessional and uncalled for.  A horrible employee and person."}
{"text":"I bought a burrito bowl yesterday and it was amazing! Great staff! Love the new menu!"}
{"text":"Great burritos.  I like Qdoba better than chipolte, the meat seems to have a better flavor.   The service is always great and fast.  So good....num num num"}
{"text":"I love the naked chicken burrito and the queso with chips is very good. I have experienced friendly service and  I am sure it won't be long before I am back."}
{"text":"Loyal client for over 7 years!! I have always loved the taco salad bowl as well as the quesadilla. Unfortunately, due to a very STINGY manager/owner I will no longer be returning. Don't know her name but I can tell you she has short dark black hair and light, pale white skin.   I ordered a half chicken and half steak quesadilla with pico de gallo. I literally had only 4-5 very tiny skimpy square pieces of meat in my tortilla. It was almost ALL steak no chicken.    To make matters worse, I had a \"free chips and queso\" coupon. She answered the phone and kept me waiting instead of putting them on a brief hold and finishing up my transaction. She did so only when I made mention that I'm in a hurry and have to leave.   Very unprofessional, disrespectful, rude and stingy!!! I would rather drive to another location where they're not feeding me just tortilla!! I have never written a review before but felt the urge that I needed to - to warn fellow clients old and new!"}
{"text":"Tried to get some tacos at 6pm on 3-19. Lights on. Store locked. Called and was told the had to close early. Why no sign? District manager told them to take it down. Wanted to look open. Will not go again."}
{"text":"This might fall under the category of \"too much Information\" but...  In the last two weeks I've been in 4 meetings catered by Qdoba and an hour or so after each meal I've had the worst indigestion. Wow, how do I spell r-e-l-i-e-f??? I need some now. I hope no one in the cubes outside my office can hear the belching or they will think I've been swilling brewskis at lunch. The first time I thought might be an anomaly, but today was the 4th...buuuuurp...lunch and...buuuurp....there it goes again."}
{"text":"Great place! The food is excellent and always fresh with huge portions (enough for 2 or 3 meals). The staff and the manager Ron are extremely helpful and friendly- the line moves quickly and it's always clean."}
{"text":"Not a big fan. Chipotle and Baja fresh are a lot better."}
{"text":"The Rice was undercooked....and I really wanted to like this place because of the great customer service."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location for about 4 years and recently the customer service and cleanliness have gone way down. I still love the food, but I will probably not be gong to this ocation anymore."}
{"text":"Really not happy with Qdoba!  Used to always be a fan of this place, but no more!  Since when are we no longer able to put black beans inside a quesadilla?!  And since when did we start charging for a little lettuce on our burritos?!  If it hadn't been for the fact that I was really hungry, and didn't feel like standing in another line, I would've walked out and gone to Chipotle or Kokopelli!  I'm so done with Qdoba!  I'll be taking my business to your competitors!"}
{"text":"If I can say anything positive about this place, it has a great location and the employees are nice.  And they have a great little outdoor patio to eat in.   But...this place is nowhere near as delicious as Chipotle.  And they are so slow, even when its not a peak meal time.   The Qdoba on Central is better.  This location is still pretty new, so maybe they are still working out some of the kinks."}
{"text":"I tasted my first Qdoba burrito last night. I went with the Queso Steak burrito. The burrito was hearty with lots of meat, rice and beans topped off with pico and some cheese and sour cream. My wife enjoyed her chicken burrito bowl with similar ingredients.  I've had many burritos from taquerias to the burrito chains. Qdoba falls somewhere in the middle. I would gladly take a Qdoba burrito over a Chipotle or Una Mas burrito any day based on my initial experience.  The staff was friendly and we were in and out for our take out order within 3-5 minutes."}
{"text":"My family and I going to Qdoba. The staff is friendly and most importantly, my daughter loves the rice, chicken, cheese and peppers in her burrito bowl.  The food is always fresh and like the ability to pick and choose what fixings and toppings you can place on your taco or burrito.  I know this may scorn some, buy I'll take Qdoba over Chipotle anyday!  The place is always clean and usually served quickly.  The chips with guac is a tasty addition to any meal.  We try and hit Qdoba once every few weeks and never disappoints!."}
{"text":"Went in Sunday to grab a burrito and was told their rice cooker was broken... So no rice, I had to have salad as a base for my burrito.  The chicken was cold and beans undercooked.  The flavors and quality of the food are just not nearly as good as Chipotle.  This is not even a reasonable substitute, especially at this location.  Never again."}
{"text":"This location changed their prices without notice, $1 tacos are now $1.29 and they don't take the Ballantyne Corporate card anymore for a discount on regular priced entrees.  When asked the cashier didn't have a good answer, basically just deal with it.  With these changes the price for value ratio is way off, this is my last visit."}
{"text":"I have been to this location multiple times and every time it gets worse. Tonight was the last straw. I went to the location in a good mood and then it was ruined by this restaurant. They were completely out of black beans and brown rice, which fine if you have the other options. I asked for additional white rice to compensate for the fact that I was not getting pinto beans. They said no because they had just ran out of white rice. Next, I asked for additional chicken due to the fact that I received no beans and less rice than usual. The answer was, \" I will have to charge you more\" to which I replied I do not want it then. They did give me a free drink, however I didn't intend to get a drink in the first place/ do not drink soda, so this was not an appropriate response. If I were Qdoba management, I would take a serious look at how this location is run. It is by far the worst Qdoba I have ever visited. I will not be returning. There is no excuse for being unable to plan for additional demand/ running out of essential ingredients to run your business. In addition to all of this, I got home (5 minutes away) and the food was already cold."}
{"text":"I went here with my family after seeing it got 5 stars.  We waited in line for about 10 minutes and ordered 2 kids taco with hard shells, 1 regular taco salad ,and 2 chicken taco salads.  Total without drinks came to $27.00. The hard taco shells came pre-made out of a box.  You can buy the same at any grocery store.  Very underwhelming.  The chicken in the tacos was very highly processed and had a rather unpleasant marinade.  The 3 taco salads again came in pre-made taco shells.  The beans tasted like they came out of a can.  All 3 adults thought the food was very marginal and will never go back.  My 9 year old said the taco was bad.  All of us prefer Carolina's or Someburros.  I did not get an opinion from my 3 year old because he did not touch the taco.  I guess he knew better."}
{"text":"So wherever I have been driving in the valley for the last 7 years apparently does not take me past a Qdoba... or I have been catatonic every time I have driven by, because I swear I did not know they were out here. I have only eaten at Qdoba once, probably 12 years ago, in Kalamazoo, MI while visiting a friend at Western Michigan University. I don't remember it being good or bad, but there wasn't one in my city so it wasn't a big deal either way.  So I was driving down Glendale Ave tonight looking for a cheap spot without french fries to eat a quick bite with a friend. We pull into the parking lot deciding on Qdoba, and the only thing I remember from 12 years ago was that whatever I ordered did not come with a tortilla... when the girl rang me up, I thought I was being helpful by pointing out my forgotten tortilla, when in fact it wasn't included with my dish, so she glared at me while handing me a free one. In other words, I was prepared to still be confused and order like an idiot my second go-around. Luckily, I started off by telling the guy behind the counter that I had no clue what was going on, and he graciously suggested something- a Queso Burrito in a bowl. He said it was \"slightly amazing.\"  So, Qdoba Guy just gave me something to order, and wasn't annoyingly overzealous with how good it was--SWEET! As I move down the line, I have more choices-like salsa. I chose the one with corn because it was mild (I'm a wimp) and had corn! But there were 5 to choose from.   It's true that this place reminded me immediately of Chipotle (brushed stainless steel everywhere, industrial/trendy/warehouse-y, small in-line ordering section, burritos the size of my head), although I enjoyed the food at Qdoba a lot more. I was immensely satisfied w/ my burrito bowl, and am still really happy about the fact that the employee's suggestion was spot-on. I appreciate it when I don't hear, \"Oh I never eat here because I work here,\" or \"I like this, but I have really weird taste.\"  So congrats, Qdoba on Glendale! After 12 years, I'm back! *though sadly, probably not to this location, as it's pretty far out of my way."}
{"text":"The staff is always helpful and pleasant and the food is always super fresh. It is always  clean and I never leave sad. Even after we dropped our entire order on the floor by accident they gave us the same thing without charging us and had great attitudes even when cleaning it up. Delicious food and great service!"}
{"text":"Closed on Sundays? Automatic low rating.   Some people have to work weekends, and it's frustrating to walk up to a place while you're hungry and have to turn around.  If the company doesn't have a national policy of being closed on Sundays,  then you should be open."}
{"text":"I have never eaten worse food, even at this place in the past. The quantity is almost half of what it used to be and the fajita veggies were filled with salt !!! Extremely disappointing. We took 5 dishes and each and every one of them sucked big time.   I came here after almost an year and can't believe how bad the food has become here.  I will never go to another Qdoba again..."}
{"text":"I love Qdoba but this specific Qdoba is nightmare fuel. First off when you walk in its dark and dirty and smelled like a school cafeteria (not a good smell) every table was dirty as well. I should have left but for some god forsaken reason I stayed and proceeded to head up front to order. The woman behind the counter looked very disheveled. She had stains and food all over her shirt, pants pretty much falling off her ass they were so loose, food covering her un gloved hands and on top of that she didn't say hello or welcome or anything instead she just says \"what do you want\" Umm I want you to get off your ass and clean this place lol but I didn't say that I told her my order and it was shortly after when I noticed this woman doesn't even know how to wrap a burrito she literally put the meat cheese etc in and rolled it like a play doh snake or some shit both ends wide open for all the stuff to fall right out.  Long story short I suggest think twice before going to this qdoba."}
{"text":"Yeah, I know this place on the surface would be considered corporate fast food, but seriously, my wife and I both really like their burritos. Good quality ingredients, tasty and surely big enough to fill you up. If you're in the vicinity and need some above average Mexican food, have no fear."}
{"text":"We drive 25 minutes every time we want Qdoba. The last couple times our food has been great, but the service sucks. Employees are rude. They don't great you with the typical banter. It feels a lot like we are inconveniencing them. Not sure it's worth the drive anymore..."}
{"text":"Always a friendly staff and the food tastes great. Always fresh every time we come here. Nice outside seating area"}
{"text":"I love the three steak tacos with cheese. I squirt a little lime over them and it really gives it that good flavor. Most places only have lemons. I love that they have limes. I eat here at least once a week."}
{"text":"I originally went to Qdoba's step brother's place, Chipotle, but there was a long line, so I went down the street to Qdoba's (no line), and ordered a Chicken Bowl (to go).   I was quite hungry, and when I ordered, I was surprised (and my hungry stomach), of how little they put in there..... I had to tell them to put MORE in, Rice, Beans, Chicken, etc...      I'm used to going to Chipotle almost every night for dinner (yes I'm a bachelor and don't cook), and they pile it on (without having to ask for more).  If Qdoba is trying to be like Chipotle they are doing it wrong.  Just fill up the bowl without me having to ask for more, and I'll be one happy (repeating) customer.   Cheers"}
{"text":"I ordered catering for my daughter's baby shower.  The guy who took the order on the phone told me that he would send an email confirmation.  He said that we \"would stay close\" until the event to make sure that I was completely satisfied with the catering.  I never heard back.  I called them again a few days later and he was not available.  I got another person on the phone who sent the email with the order info.  It only had listed the food.  No date or time on the order.  They have a very poor system of ordering for catering.  We had multiple email exchanges so I thought they had my order.    On the day of my event, I did not have food for my guests at the scheduled time.  It took me almost half an hour to get resolution.  They were more concerned with placing blame and making excuses.  I got my food 1 HOUR LATE.  We had to be out of our party room at a designated time so I had to rush my guests.  In addition, I missed a significant amount of time with my guests trying to resolve.  My once in a lifetime event was stressful and embarassing to me as the hostess.    I schedule catering for lunches a couple times a month for my job.  With so many excellent catering options in the Valley, I would avoid using them at all."}
{"text":"Food was so so, they did not offer salsa when I asked for no cheese or sour cream but extra mango for salad I was questioned if it was my first time and if so they would just this once give me an extra scoop (size of a tablespoon) otherwise it's too expensive to accommodate me."}
{"text":"This place gets worse each visit. No pico this trip. Staff could care less that you are here. amazing they stay in business."}
{"text":"If I could half a star I would.  Looks a bad corporate template of chipotle.  The chicken was dry and flavorless and the brown rice had no flavor.  If you want Mexican don't go here."}
{"text":"Visit #1: They shampooed the carpets during dinner rush; more than one person slipped.  Visit #2: They blocked off one garbage can while the other overflowed  Visit #3: All the empty tables were dirty  Visit #4: Just kidding. I'm not a glutton for punishment"}
{"text":"i eat here several times a month because it is convenient.  I love that it is clean, close and consistent.   the service always rocks. they are pleasant and kind.  however...the beans are undercooked...tortillas a bit sticky.  the hot sauce is lovely and flavorful though!  i continue to lunch here ...but i wish the food was a wee bit better."}
{"text":"I love Qdoba I go here every weekend have a Member card etc. Many people think of this as the same thing as Chipotle they are very similar except I here they have a bit more choices I believe. I used to go to Chipotle a lot but once I found this place this is all I ever go to. Best thing about this place is the Queso Burrito. Best thing on the menu.   Also when I ask for a side of rice they give me a nice cup of rice on the side for like .80 cents unlike Chipotle when I asked for a side of rice they give me this little \"shot glass\" sized plastic cup of rice and expect me to pay 1.35 or something like that.   Now I won't say that this place is authentic mexican food but hey it's good food. I'm sure you can find some authentic mexican place if you want that but this place has its own menu and its own flavor. Definately a place you should try out and see for yourself.  I am a regular at the Rural Rd location and love the people there. They are nice and friendly and since I always have a hard time deciding they give me some pushes in the right direction to get me to decide. ;P The place is always clean and have never had a problem here."}
{"text":"A total chipotle rip-off. They have the same setup, with the white rice (with green seaweed things in it) and choice of meat beans etc. The prices are higher than Chipotle, a buritto was more than $6. The people weren't especially friendly or anything, but not a big deal. The food is nothing special, unoriginal, and expensive. If you'd like food that is exactally like Chipotle, then you may as well actually go to Chipotle and pay less for a meal."}
{"text":"We had this Qdoba cater a Celebration of Life for my late Aunt.  I had never heard of Qdoba - a family member suggested them and we were so happy they did.  Carla and her staff did a great job, food was yummy and the cost very reasonable to feed 25 people.  Qdoba, came and set everything up for us - food stayed hot for several hours.  It was so much better than deli meat/cheese sandwich trays.  Everybody loved it.  We will use them again."}
{"text":"First time in. Food looked and smelled great. Restaurant was clean and well lit. Friendly staff were patient with us as we decided what we wanted. I had the BBQ pulled pork burrito.  She had tacos and tortilla soup. Great all around.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Well my rice was crunchy. My black beans hard and flavorless, my tortilla was sticky and I got mostly dark chicken in my burrito.  Ugggggh!"}
{"text":"This place has gone from five stars to one star in my opinion in less than six months.  I took an eight and nine year old to Qdoba last night and they wanted really simple burritos - just rice, beans and cheese, with chicken on the side for both.  One wanted pico and one wanted guac, but rather than in the burrito, they wanted them on the side for dipping.  The pans that the ingredients were in were running out, and so rather than refill them, the guy who worked there made two of the smallest burritos I've seen (even the girls commented on their size once they saw them).  The chicken was mostly the little charred pieces that had fallen off the bigger pieces of chicken so that what they had in their cups was mostly little charred pieces of meat and not much else.  He then also said he'd have to charge me for the guac since it wasn't inside the burrito (while signs in the restaurant said \"Free Guac with entree\" and \"Order with Abandon\").  All this to top off a roughly 30% price increase a few months ago.  I used to go to Qdoba about three times a week. Now I go about once every three weeks, and if I can get my daughter to go to Chipotle more, it will be even less.  I'd expect this chain to close its doors before the end of 2015.  Too sad - I really used to like this place."}
{"text":"Consistently consistent. Fresh. Made to order ANY way you like it. Lines move quickly and service, although not always the friendliest, gets it right. Get a Naked Burrito and save the tortilla calories for one of the moist chocolate brownies."}
{"text":"Okay, so being a huge fan of Chipotle and noticing a trend that Chipotle-style restaurants that offer the line style of food usually are way below par I was not sure about trying this place. They were offering buy 1 get 1 coupons and we couldn't afford not to try it in case it was a good find. The food here is okay. The flavor falls very short of Chipotle and the flavors run more on the bland side. The first time I ate here I felt like I could barely taste my food. For two people to get full for less than $8 bucks though....sometimes you just suck it up and make the exception. We both usually get the Queso style burritos, mine vegetarian, my boyfriend gets chicken or steak. Now that I have eaten here a few times, when the coupon gets me, I'm a bit more acquainted with the flavors and find the food to be tasty. Not great, but not bad. Let's put it this way, I would not pay full price to eat here...but if a coupon presents itself and I don't feel like cooking, why not?"}
{"text":"Since people seem to be comparing Qdoba with Chipotle, I'll stick with the trend.  You wouldn't be too far off to say that they are essentially the same thing.  If you just want a standard issue burrito, you'll probably have a hard time distinguishing one from the other.  However, Qdoba has a bigger selection and has better seasoning/spices in my opinion. Three examples are the quesadillas, the fajita burrito, and the chicken nachos.  The one and only time I tried to get quesadillas at Chipotle, they weren't even on the menu. So they slapped together something that was literally cheese and chicken, and charged me almost $6.  At Qdoba you get the whole nine yards for the same price. The fajita burrito seasoning is much better at Qdoba, and the chicken nachos (you can get steak, pork, etc. too) are hands down the best fast food nachos around.  They're about $6.  Oh, also Qdoba's taco salad is very good too.  The portions are pretty big too at Qdoba, which is nice for leftovers as long as you can stop yourself from over-eating, haha.  The other reviewers complaining must have had a randomly bad experience.  I frequent this Qdoba about once a month and have never been unhappy with food quality or service.  In my opinion I would always choose Qdoba over Chipotle or other similar restaurants.  Also, someone complained about a \"3,000 calorie monstrosity of a burrito\".  Well, if you actually look it up it's more like 1,000 - 1,200 calories for a standard burrito.  Still not exactly healthy.  But come on now, this is fast food after-all."}
{"text":"Food is tasty, slightly on the expensive side. Staff is hit or miss. Cleanliness sometimes appears questionable but not bad."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night for some take out.  I was very impressed with how nice and knowledgeable everyone was.  I asked if the tortillas were vegan (they were!!) so I asked for two veggie burritos and as they were making them for me, the manager told me that she'd give me a sample of their soup, as it was vegan also.  No need for a sample, sign me up for the full cup!  I love tortilla soup, and theirs is tomato based, weeeeeee!  My burrito came with amazing cilantro lime rice (way more limey than Chipotle), black beans, guac, fajita veggies, pico and medium salsa.  It was divine!  My woman was equally pleased with the outcome of her burrito (rice, beans,fajita veggies, and pico).  When I was a cheese eater, I would order their chips and queso dip, which is totally yumsky."}
{"text":"Outrageously expensive, and for some mysterious reason, every freaking option has onions in it. Why? Why does everything have to have chunky onions? But if you like Chipotle, you will like this place because it's the same crappy menu and exorbitant prices."}
{"text":"Only getting 2 stars cause I love their Mexican gumbo.....normally. not this time.  Went in tonight. First of all...they let a boy who was about 5 years old sit on the counter where you receive your food and pay. The girl ringing them out never told the boy to get his butt off the counter.  He sat there for a long while touching all the cups and stuff by the register. Gross. Then he finally jumped off after his mom had finally left the restaurant.  As he stood outside waiting for him and then he jumped down and ran out.  The worker never wiped the counter down. Yuck! Then as we were placing our order, the shredded beef was all dry...what was left of it and it was crusty looking. He still served it to us. Then, they went and got new meat. The guac was brown, the tortilla strip were stale. Ordered chips n salsa too. SUPER STALE. drove 30 miles just for the gumbo.  What a waste.  Would love my gas n food money back. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I went to this because my girlfriend is absolutely in love with this place. She said it was better than Chipoltle.  Qdoba is the equivalent of Jack in the Box compared to Chipoltle. It's dirty, smelly, grimy, the employees are rude and look dirty and it smells.  There was hair in my food. The tables were unclean. It basically is a sewage dump in this restaurant."}
{"text":"This Qdoba has disappointed me one too many times and I've decided that I won't go back anymore.  It's filthy inside. The kitchen is VISIBLY dirty. So I'm a little concerned about the cleanliness of the food. Today there were brownies sitting open in the kitchen. Obviously not Qdoba products, so they should be kept in the break room, well away from the food! That's terrible form.  The employees don't care and don't listen. Be prepared to repeat yourself 10 times. Even if your order ends up correct, it won't taste that good, because the food is mostly tasteless. Free guac is nice, but they give you about two tablespoons, so is it really worth it? Nah.  Skip this Qdoba. I'm not bashing the chain-- there are great locations in other states. But this one is not a good option at all."}
{"text":"Seeing how little went into my quesadilla, I'm not comfortable with paying over $7. At least use a mixed cheese blend!  And seeing how little effort went into making my quesadilla, I am really not impressed (you would think a labor charge is rolled into the price of food.)  Maybe what distinguishes Qdoba are the burritos with their special combos, but I am nonplussed to try them again. Oh well."}
{"text":"We were very sorry to see Qdoba in Scottsdale close.  We hope they are still here and just found a better location, location, location!  The food is always good and they treat us like familly."}
{"text":"Always liked this much more than Chipolte. The burritos are stuffed and huge. The chicken is really, really flavorful. I feel it is a healthy alternative to other fast food Mexican joints.   The new mango spicy salsa is great in the burrito. There are also plenty of options to go into the burro."}
{"text":"I give this place 2 Stars and that's being generous. There is no crowd, there is no line, the tables and chairs are filled with crumbs and they're all messy. The service does not even qualify for any stars. Unfriendly slowly paced staff. This is my first time visiting this establishment and I can safely say I will not be returning. I am unsure if other locations have better service and are cleaner, but I am highly disappointed in this location. I ordered the 3 taco special which is $9 and it was not worth it at all. Aside from the poor customer service. The people who prepare the food clearly have no form of Education in The Culinary Department. The tacos that I paid $9 for, were poorly prepared and are tasteless. The chicken is cold the pico de gallo is not properly cut the avocado is acidic and the presentation was extremely poor. I havent even began to talk about the actual station where they prepare the food. The mix all the utensils in other dishes creating chaos amongst all the food that is at the counter. As dirty as the kitchen is, the dining areas is just as dirty.  If you ever visit this location I hope you have a better experience than I have."}
{"text":"My wife went there for lunch at  12:45 03/05/2015. There was 2 clerks working. My wife was getting very fraustrated when they were not making eye  contact with her as a customer.  When she got to the cash register she noticed an overflowing Trash and lots of trash on the floor. At that point she was disgusted and loss her appetite. Not to mention the very poor customer service.  Thank you qdoba employees at that time for making my wife miserable. I had to hear about it when she got home.  Not blaming qdoba,I'm blaming the employees at that time."}
{"text":"This past Saturday me and my room mate decided to check this place out due to the fact that it was lunch time and we were in the area. I have heard their commercials before and I have been wanting to check the place out. I am a huge fan of Chipotle and due to everyone's reviews that this restaurant is of a similar concept, it was my idea to go there.   Once there, there were only two young girls behind the counter, no one else in the restaurant. Because I had never been there, I was looking over their menu. The girl however, seemed in a rush to get my order done so she could go back to talking to her co worker. As I was going through the line I was asking for recommendations on what she thought went best together but again, she seemed bother to help me and had a bad attitude. She kept making comments on the fact they didn't charge extra for guacamole and I figured it was their job to sell you on that. Also, the food behind the counter seemed like it was sitting there all day and did not look appetizing at all. There was trash on the floor of the restaurant and there was even chairs on top of the tables. For a restaurant that didn't seem busy at all I would expect cleanliness.   I ended up paying $11.00 for a bowl that seemed smaller than the bowls at chipotle that I would normally spend $9.00 for even with the extra guacamole. The worst part of my experience is that both  my room mate and I ended up getting food poisoning even though we ordered two completely different things. I literally rushed home to throw up because their food was so heavy on me. I automatically knew that it was from there because I had not eaten anything all day before that.   I definitely do not recommend this place at all. I am going to stick with Chipotle all the way. My first experience with this restaurant will be the only one. Their  staff need to change their attitude as well."}
{"text":"This is a similar restaurant to Moe's and Chipotle.  I would say they are all interchangeable. Although I like the salsa bar that Moe's has and the others don't.  They have Shredded Pork (Carnitas)  which is always a plus for me.  The first time I had the pork it was great, the second time it was mushy, but very edible either way.  I would stay away from the steak, I found it rubbery. They have excellent Guacamole and Queso dip and chips.  EDIT: 10/17/2008  I went back the other day and had the Mexican Gumbo.  This dish alone moved them up to a 4 star from a 3 for me.  It's pretty fantastic and a very different menu item from the other quick burrito places.  If you want something like chili but a little lighter I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I put this right up there with Chipotle in terms of quality.  Prices are relatively the same. Chips & queso are amazing. I had the 3 tacos, one chicken/steak/grilled pork/. The grilled pork, wasn't too great, but the steak and chicken were, they tasted fresh, and juicy, even 30 min before closing time."}
{"text":"So I can only review one item at Qdoba, because there's only one item I've eaten there since my freshman year of college in Madison... vegetarian nachos. I love them.  Which is why I was so glad to find out a Qdoba was opening up in Tempe. I'd tried the one in Central Phoenix once in a while, but it was really too far for me to drive to get nachos.  I'm not really a fan of other fast food Mexican food unless I'm really drunk. But Qdoba is different. Because of those fabulous nachos. Black beans, wonderfully flavorful cheese sauce, cheese, corn salsa and a side of guacamole... mmmm..... love it, love it, love it.   On lunch trips with coworkers, my friends don't seem to be as impressed as I have been. But I don't care. I'll go alone."}
{"text":"Clean fast food restaurant but the food was horrible tasting and looking. The containers that held the food wasn't covered. So the variety of meat, beans and other toppings looked as if it hasn't been refilled, reheated, or at least stirred before we reached the counters.  I ordered three grilled chicken tacos and the tortillas were cold. Only had a nibble of chicken on the tacos so it would pretty much be a veggie taco lol.  Staff was ok, restaurant was very cool but I've definitely experienced better."}
{"text":"Was really disappointed after driving all the way from Glendale by Westgate and even call to see what time they closed, the woman said 10pm, arrived around 905pm and the restaurant was closed that quickly, i called the number 602 493-8100 that i called previously and the voicemail came on, still scratching my head on that one, maybe an emergency came up for the staff, i guess ill try again in the future, sucks for your 1st time experience..."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Qdoba and have been eating at the one on Tatum and Cactus since it opened.  Solid.  Great food, quick service and clean other than at high noon when the tables get a little messy.  The one star review for this store is a joke.  Adam S. must work at Chipoltle, and what's wrong with Jack in the Box.  Nothing better for late night chow.  Great queso, great tasting chips too.  I typically eat the taco salad with steak etc.  You can eat real healthy or not.  This is a good fast food spot.  P.S. I've been to a Chipoltle once and if was okay.  For me I compared it to Qdoba and have not been back.  Qdoba hits the spot."}
{"text":"Not my favorite get in line, order what you like fast Mexican food. However, it almost tastes the same. If you need to use the restroom, enjoy the long and narrow walk there. This has to be the longest walk to a restroom I have experienced in a restaurant. Not complaining, but you may be able to get a semi workout doing lunges there and back.  The other place has a line of workers ready to take your order. For whatever reason, this place seemed understaffed and only 2 people were on the line. The other place I can see the cook flipping the marinated meats on the grills. However, this place did not have the cook visible making the meats. The grills that were visible were vacant. Ultimately, it seemed slow on a Tuesday dinner night. Even more as the restaurant is very open with a huge amount of seating.  The wifey and I ordered a Chicken Ranchera Burrito with guacamole and chips. The chips are made fresh daily, and they were lightly salted, which were somewhat bland. The burrito was tasty that had a nice flavor from the fajitas. Overall, A-ok food.  This may be a somewhat biased opinion based on my affinity to the other place. But my 3 stars are on the overall experience. Will I come back? Only if the wifey wants to."}
{"text":"First time I went to Qdoba's was on a business trip to California.  I told my husband when I got back, \"If we ever pass by one of these, we should take you!\"  Low and behold, we passed by one a couple days ago.  His repsonse, \"It's good, I like it but wouldn't drive across town just to come here.\"  (We live on the west side and happen to be in the area.)  The food is comparable to Chipotle's but has a lot more different selections than just burrito's.  Had the nacho's and thought the cheese sauce they drizzle on top was delectable.  I gave them 3 stars b'c the food was good but not spectacular.  Also, the waitress totally skipped over my husband and went to the next customer in line.  Not a big deal of course but pretty carless, IMO.    If you are a fan of Chipotle type \"Mexican\" food, I definitely think you should give this place a go.  Definitely \"lighter\" than \"real\" Mexican food but, I think, hits the spot."}
{"text":"The service was great but the food was all right.  I've been to several Qdoba's and this one was just not up to par."}
{"text":"I love this place the more I go to it! The service is completely out of the ordinary for fast food and now they have something called, Mexican Gumbo. Holy schneikies it's good!!! Can't beat the prices either! If I had a choice of this place over Chipotle, I would choose Qdoba ANY day!!!"}
{"text":"This place really isn't good at all...I ordered a ground beef burrito.  I don't like rice in my burrito, so the guy making it said do you want double beans then?  Umm no I don't, then he proceeded to give me a tiny spoonful of dried out ground beef.  I added queso, Pico, hot (strange flavor salsa) and shredded cheese!  All I can it say is that this $8.45 burrito was pure slop.  The canned beans are flavorless, the ground beef and lack thereof was a joke.  Again just not good at all.  The place seems to run by a bunch of very lazy young Hispanic employees who don't grasp the concept of a clean restaurant, or replenishing the steam table with fresh ingredients.  Pancheros and Chipotle certainly blow this place out of the water!  How this place stays open is beyond me!"}
{"text":"wanna be chipotle and sauce is bleh .. Guac is free but price is high! I guess the price makes up for it. Won't be returning"}
{"text":"Van full, 9:30pm, all hungry. We stopped by and got there, at the doors, at 9:50 (they close at 10:00pm), and the doors were locked, OPEN sign turned off, cleaning up. I knocked, and the lady signaled that they were closed! What?! I was like \"10!\" and put up all 10 fingers at her, and she just kept looking at me and shaking her head... So apparently, the managers and/or employees here care more about going home on time than the customers or keeping a job. Very short sighted. If they don't get customers, store closes, people lose jobs. They lost out on a nice sized check, and I can say with management like that, we're not going to support that business, and our money is going elsewhere. I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"Forgot how good the food is here..Damn they need one in Yuma!!!"}
{"text":"Holy smokes does this place suck.  I was told by someone that is was like Chipolte, only better. THEM is fighting words, so of course I had to check it out.  I dragged two co-workers of mine over there, and I got a carne asada burro, side of chips and guacamole. The service was ok, not too friendly, and didn't try too hard. That's ok, it isn't fine dining. The prices were higher than Chipolte, so maybe the flavors were better?  Getting back to the office we started in on this lunch. The best way to describe it, is space food. They say that in space food doesn't have flavor, so on the bright side, for the cost of lunch it was like being in space. The carne asada had ZERO flavor. The guac had no salt, garlic, nada. Just avacado. So weird? The rice in the burro had no flavor either, I don't know if the food was props for movies, or what?  Skip this place, go a mile down the road for Chipolte, or head just West to America's Tacos."}
{"text":"Always taste fresh and great. Employees are always friendly and funny. Good price."}
{"text":"Qdoba is a kicked up version of Chipotle/Kokopellis.  You walk up, choose a form of delivery (burrito, nachos, salad, burrito bowl, etc) you get a choice of meat (chicken, steak, etc) then you chose your toppings (different salsas, lettuce, cheese).  We all know the drill.  I will say one thing Qdoba is much better in taste than Kokopellis and Chipotle."}
{"text":"The Qdoba at StoneCrest is somewhat better than the average Qdobas in the Charlotte area.  The store clean and the service is generally nice.  Food portions varies at times from satisfying amounts to obvious skimping (just ask for a little more if this happens).  The food quality seems better, compared to other Qdobas in the area.  I typically order a burrito (either beef or pork), in which sometimes it rips apart; so have chips ready (if ordered the combo) for possible clean-up. Their tacos are overpriced for what you get, skip'em.  This location accepts the local \"Ballantyne Card,\" which gives 20% off from 11am-3pm (Monday-Friday); this is much better than adding points on the Qdoba Card."}
{"text":"Similar to a chipotle, but with additional options.  I tried the Mango Salsa Taco Salad (chicken). Very delicious. The flavor was balanced very well.   I would return here again. Only place outside of a sit down restaurant I am aware of where you can get a taco salad with the shell. And mango salsa...love it!"}
{"text":"I really like Qdoba!   I even like it better than Chipotle!  I think the food has a better flavor overall than Chipotle- the chicken, beef, and rice- definitely.  I also love that the guacamole does NOT have tomatoes in it, but that's because I'm allergic to tomatoes.     I like getting the Naked Burrito, which is basically everything that would be in a burrito, but in a bowl rather than a tortilla.   I order a side of chips and eat it like nachos, but without the chips getting all soggy.    I have used their catering service for our office (20 people) and they really do a great job with the delivery, setting up the chafing dishes, and the quality of the food is super.    The restaurant is a typical fast food, carry stuff on a tray, type place, but it's always clean and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"While I would prefer to go to Chipotle, those are all outside of the \"Ballantyne bubble\"... so when I am working and want to grab a quick burrito, I'll head over to the Qdoba at Stonecrest.    This location is generally a lot busier than the Qdoba at the Arborteum, but the food quality is about the same. My favorite menu item here is the poblano pesto burrito w/chicken.    I think the food here is better quality than Moe's at Ballantyne Village."}
{"text":"Like others have said, its just like Chipotle.  Jack In The Box's version of Chipotle (which used to be a McDonalds company).  Someone could give me a chicken burrito made the same way at both, and I probably would not know the difference.  Chipotle's chicken has a little bit more spice, but other than that I can't see much of a difference.  They do have slightly more variety than Chipotle does in terms of the entree's you can get.  I see no point to drive out of my way to go to a Qdoba, when there are like 5 times as many Chipotle's around."}
{"text":"The WORST Qdoba I've ever been to. The service is horrendous. The girls just hang out in the back. They were out of queso (the best part) and the rice wasn't cooked or the veggies. In front of me the were discussing their plans for the night, just ignoring me, no effort whatsoever.   I take my queso very seriously. And everything else really just added to my disappointment."}
{"text":"I like this location.  They have a lot of turnover, but for the most part everyone has been pretty good.  Wish the outside tables were cleaned more often.  They are too dirty 90% of the time to use."}
{"text":"Maybe if I write a review like Dallas G, I'll get ROTD.  Here goes:  \"Who am I but a slave to the forces of nature?  As a slave, am I free to pass judgment on those slaves toiling aside me, dawn till dusk (at which point I go and fornicate with whomever may be willing)?  No, I am not, and as this commonest of men will tell you, no one should ever cast such noble servants of the world order to the depths of a poor Yelp review.  So I say five stars to any old establishment that can churn out even the most mediocre of food!  Qdoba is just such a place.  Good people with good intentions, making decent food for other ants in the giant ant farm we call life.  Go there, enjoy yourself, bask in the glory of it all.\"  But I am not Dallas G, nor would I want to be, because he is vegan and that makes life inordinately difficult.  It also means that his burrito had probably 900 calories fewer than my burrito, which was essentially the same except with two cups of queso sauce and a bunch of steak.  Of course, with queso and steak means that there will be at least a modicum of taste, and that is true--but I say that the food is average there, and only deserving of three stars, because I don't know if it was the salsa or what, but there was a strange flavor that permeated the entire burrito. Not a bad flavor, but not a good flavor--it almost was like eating two pounds of roasted tomatillos in a burrito.  Finally, I begrudge them for having water that came straight from the bottom of an overly-chlorinated pool.  Qdoba is decent, worth a meal once or twice a month, max.  But order a real drink."}
{"text":"Uhg, horrible. I am so sick to my tummy. I knew it was bad when I saw that the guacamole was brown. Now I'm in the urgent care sick with diarrhea and they say it's definitely food poisoning. It was overpriced and I feel like poop.  The staff obviously doesn't care about the food, it's just left out in open faced containers and not fresh at all. The pinto beans looked very old so I got black beans instead, but it didnt matter. Their cheese was also funky on top, needed to be stirred, but it was so old that it had settled or curdled. I don't know, but it was gross. The chicken I had looked old and severely overcooked, the food was just bad. The chips were good, but the every option for meat all looked terrible, so alas, I settled for chicken. Wrong answer. It was all bad. Even the service.  I mentioned it was overpriced and the employee didn't even explain pricing. It's about 10 dollars a meal, and not at all worth any of the money paid for it because the staff obviously doesn't care about the food or the people eating here.  Skip this place if you can avoid it. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Friendly, but sandy grit in my salad, tasteless chicken, and didn't get my water cup I asked for."}
{"text":"I love Qdoba! Their burrito bowls are great! They're pretty much the equivalent of Chipotle, but I love Chipotle so...it's all good! I like to build my own burrito bowl and have their chips and guac. Definitely a yummy Chipotle alternative, although to be completely honest - I don't know if there's much of a difference."}
{"text":"Qdoba is a good choice for a quick lunch or dinner.  I had the shredded beef burrito, it was good overall. Beef had good flavor and of course I added a few extras to my flour burrito. Cheese, corn, cheese sauce. Still, just a basic meal and a little pricy but I keep coming back."}
{"text":"On the way to dinner last night, my boyfriend and I ran into an old friend. We told him we were going out to eat and he said we should get burritos. My boyfriend was all over this idea and suggested we go to Qdoba at Stonecrest.   Wow! Where have I been? I havent been to Qdoba since high school and I have no idea why! We ordered our burritos... The line was a little slow but nothing major.... And then saw their $1 beer promo! Um yes please. We got a couple beers with our burritos and sat by the windows. 2 burritos and 4 beers only came to $20! Not too shabby.  It was so nice to have a great priced beer with a huge delicious burrito in a cool & comfortable atmosphere!   Thanks Qdoba!  We will be back very soon!!!   Definitely a fan! :) :)"}
{"text":"The Q, in a nutshell, is a Mexican fast food chain, like Chipotle, but with a more flavorful and a more varied menu. Which is great in theory. The problem is that once you've had some great Q, it leaves you craving for more. And this particular location seems to me to suffer from the sub-par franchisee syndrome. Let me explain: You know how you can have good Subways and then the not so good Subways? Same chain, same meal, but very different experience... Well, same thing here. Specifically, my former co-workers and I used to freqent another location, close to my old office in Los Angeles. And when I say frequent, I'm talking almost daily for a few months there. Or so it seems. We loved it. But the food and dining experience at this here location just doesn't seem as good. Maybe the lower volume of customers means that the ingredients are sitting around longer. Maybe it's the staff. I'm not sure. So, in conclusion, better than Chipotle, but not as good as some other Qs."}
{"text":"Good burritos. The queso sauce is pretty good with chips."}
{"text":"I like coming to this Qdoba because it is close to my house and my office.  Sometimes I will come here on my lunch break or I will come here for dinner with friends on the weekend.  It is a small shop in the Central Park shopping center.   My favorite thing to get here is the Craft 2,  you can pick from a variety of things.  For example you can get tacos, tortilla soup, quesadilla or a naked taco salad.  I always get two soft tacos and two hard tacos.    The downside on this Qdoba is that they are closed on Sundays and they are not open very late on Friday and Saturdays."}
{"text":"My friend and I walked in and we were told that their systems were down and it would take about five minutes. We weren't really bothered, and decided to wait for them to be up and running.   Once they were done we both decided to order a quesadilla each.  There was a younger boy and and another guy in in his 20's working behind the counter.  Both of them were super slow while preparing our meals.  The younger guy was quite literally the slowest person I've ever had serve me, with no sense of urgency. As my friend's quesadilla was being made by the older boy, she had questions about her meal and the guy behind the counter was rude to her.  A few times he responded and she asked him to repeat himself and he seemed upset. His whole demeanor was as if he didn't want us there at all. I understand that they might have been slow because they were waiting on an ingredient, but neither of the two ever said that. The two behind the counter seemed like they didn't know what they were doing either.  After they finally finished preparing our quesadillas the manager came out and said that the machine to cook the quesadilla would take about 20 minutes to complete, and that because of their systems being down our meals would be on them. We decided since their machines were down and we had only half of our orders that we would come back to pick them up in a few minutes.   Of course, we had to wait for them to make another couple of quesadillas for us with the same crappy service.  (I understand their reasoning for making another one - food-born illness and letting food get too warm or too cold)   We found out after receiving our lunch that all Qdobos are closing their doors in a short amount of time, but that shouldn't negate even the smallest amount of service.  The manager was the only person in that restaurant who actually cared about her customers. I wish her well after the closing of this store, but I have to give this location only two stars based on the horrible customer service of the two guys behind the counter, and the fact that they comped our meal."}
{"text":"The food here is just ok, but the prices for whatever reason never seem to be the same, I came in yesterday just wanting something different so I ordered the nachos and a drink, bill was over 10.00 are you serious!!!!, better places around there for less money"}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer to this Qdoba location for about a year now. 3-4 times a month I absolutely have to have some queso!!! But this location is very disappointing as of a few months ago when a new manager took over. I was putting up with it, but after visiting today I am through for good!!! The manager at this location is an older lady, I would say late 50's. I had my food all ready to go and she was ringing me up when another customer asked her a quick question. Instead of finishing ringing me up, she completely turned all of her attention to this gentleman and stopped ringing me up, my card in hand! She set my card on the counter and went to the back, and didn't come back for 2 minutes!! The other employees were flustered because they had a rush and couldn't stop making food to deal with the queue. The manager comes back and was very short with me, and when I told her I wanted chips and queso as well, she was so rude to the employee and was snapping at the employee. That's not only bad management, that's bad taste to do so in front of the customers. She had my bag all ready to go and gave me my card, but failed to hand me my bag as she ran off to the back again. I sat there for a moment or two until reaching across the counter to grab my food. I was going to walk away but just couldn't!!! I waited until she came back instead of leaving and told her bluntly how rude she had been and how dissatisfied I was with the service and had been for the past few months. To my utter shock, she said \"I don't know what to tell you besides suggesting you don't come back then if you're that unhappy. Have a nice day.\"  The nerve!!!! She had pleasantly told me to go screw myself in restaurant manager terms!  I will NEVER return to this location. Go to chipotle!!!!"}
{"text":"Another in a line of chipotle style rip offs this place offers the usual cast of faux Mexican dining fare. White rice, black beans, corn, and a few meat options, check. Hipsters who act like they can not put down their phones yet are so concerned about saving the earth, check. While there is nothing wrong with the idea (imitation is the sincerest form of flattery) just how many of these places do we need?  In my opinion if you are going to copy something at least bring something new to the table when you do! This place does not meet that goal. In fact they manage to mess up some of the basic things that chipotle did right while charging you more at the same time. That is quite a feat to pull off lol. My order was for two burritos (one pork, green sauce, brown rice, cheese and the other shredded beef, cilantro lime rice, black beans and hot sauce). Both were a nice size (compared to chipotle) yet cost almost a full 2 dollars more! The pork had a nice spice but was to salty for me. The green verde sauce was ok but tasted of mostly tomatillos. It could have used something to balance it out like cumin, roasted poblanos, honey or even some more garlic. With drinks the total came out to something like 22.50 for two people! I can make this food at home for way less than that and still have money left for dessert. While it is nice to try eating somewhere new it is not worth almost $25 and 110 plus degree days just to eat here again. Good for some but for me No Bueno!"}
{"text":"People who compare qdoba to chipotle are seriously handicap.   There are similarities but not enough to justify this statement.   If I would have gotten a burrito and not seen it made I probably would have given it 4 stars because it's pretty tasty. (I was starving while pre thx giving shopping so I actually ate it, had I not been so hungry I would have left after looking at the food display)  Everything had been sitting out so long it had a film, the guacamole was brown and crusty looking, everything else was splattered around the tins and left long enough for it to crust up. I came at 7 so that's a normal dinner time, even if it was slow you should be wiping all that crust crap. I think she saw the look of nasty on my face and tried to stir everything up but it was too late.   The sweet girl working was like once you taste this you'll want to come back once a week. Hmmm maybe if things were fresh!   Then when I got my drink there were lids in the lid dispenser that were filthy! They were brown- I was like \"did someone step on these and put them back?\"   5star service 4 star taste Negative stars for freshness Negative stars for cleanliness  I probably won't be back unless they make some serious changes.  Too bad bc it was cheap and pretty flavorful"}
{"text":"Qdoba is probably my favorite fast food Mexican place in Charlotte. The two things I base my favorites on are the chips which need to be sliced thinly and have just the right amount of salt and the queso. All good here. I also really like their taco salads and burritos. Overall, great place."}
{"text":"Worst experience I have ever had....the serving guy had the worst attitude I have ever had...I'm 54 years old and I can not remember having such an unprofessional server...my wife was telling him what she wanted and he was slamming around like a child. He was angry and yelling at the other staff in front of us and 5 other people who were in line. Unbelievable. The person I am referring to to be clear is a 5,6 Hispanic male with a shaved head. He had a \" diamond backs \" tattoo on  his arm with other tattoos. I doubt I will ever eat here again even though I do like the food. The other staff two black gentlemen an Hispanic lady and a white kid were busting their butts...and this guy was talking to them like dirt.....again in front of all customers in line....any other issues here call guest help at 858-522-4571. I'm typing this in the store right now. Wasted $19.00..."}
{"text":"Yes, Four Stars.  Actually Qdoba is pretty close to Chipotle in taste and setup (see photos).  You get in line, tell them either Burrito or Taco, what beans, onions, guacamole, et cetera you want, and before you know it you are enjoying a flavorful meal.  I found Qdoba is trying very hard to stay relevant in a very crowded \"fast casual Mexican food\" segment. and seems doing a good job and business.  I came here a few weeks ago on a whim and enjoyed myself.  It was around 2 pm and they were just recovering from a busy lunch crowd.  I believe some of the pluses that standout from that visit is the diversity of the food menu and variety of choices when you are ordering.  One example is their Queso.  Yes they have it and it's as delicious as anything you can make in your microwave at home. LOL  So Four Stars and \"Yay! I'm a fan.\"  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We got a groupon for Qdoba this past week.  Rude service.  Only 2 on staff in the whole place.  Line took FOREVER to get through.  Luckily our Groupon lowered the price to reasonable levels.  Normally this place is more expensive than Chipotle, yet not nearly as good.  Water from tap tasted horrible.  Every garbage can was overflowing with trash.  Dirty tables, etc.  Glad it was half off... but I don't think I'd even buy another Groupon here."}
{"text":"I have been Chipotle faithful for about 2 years now, and it wasn't very difficult.  Restaurants such as Rubio's and the Blue Burrito just didn't stack up to a Chipotle burrito.  Then came Qdoba.  This restaurant is pretty much a carbon copy of Chipotle (2 of the employees on duty actually worked at my former Chipotle of choice).  I had a chicken burrito (my Chipotle norm) so I could make as direct of a comparison as possible.    The food was great, and afterwards I didn't get that \"punched in the stomach\" feeling that Chipotle gives me for some time after I eat it (I am convinced their rice expands in your stomach, but it tastes good so I suffer through it).    I also picked up their frequent customer swipe card (buy 10 burritos get one free + free chips and salsa after activation).  This place is closer to my place than any Chipotle, so I will be coming very often!   P.S. If anyone if privy to the correct pronunciation let me know! (ku-doh-ba???)"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. Welcome to chipotle/barbacoa's sexier sister. This place is great for a chicken burrito on the go. It's fresh, it's fast and it's consistent. Definitely a place that makes for a great lunch. Plenty of outdoor seating and it's not overrun with birds"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! It reminds me of Chipotle, but the food is better. The + for me is that they have Chips and Queso! Mmmmmmm.....I highly recommend this place. You got to try it!!!"}
{"text":"I'm fully aware that Qdoba is the burrito equivalent of Subway.  But I'm fine with that.  I even once tried the Chipotle across the street just to try a different place.  Qdoba remains my favorite burrito on the go stop for a few reasons.  It's quick, convenient, and I have a stack of gift certificates to use.  But even without the discounts, I would still go here.  I'm not there every day, but probably once every 1-2 months.  I think I've tried every burrito they offer and I can't even pick my favorite because I've enjoyed them all.  The pulled pork and shredded beef surprised me.  The queso burrito melts in my mouth.  I've even found a place in my heart for the veggie burrito.    If you're on McKnight and drive by, stop in and give it a try.  Its location next to The Exchange doesn't hurt either."}
{"text":"Wow what a bad location! Stay away, came here with my girl 215 pm today and no one was in here, there was a girl and guy working. Just messing around behind the counter. The place was super dirty, the bathrooms so filthy. Then asked her things about the food she told me she does not eat here anymore so has not recommendations. The kid in the back was singing and laughing. Steak dry, veggies not ready, beef not ready and there was an argument on who had to cook it for us. I just moved down the street a big fan of the chain in socal but for sure will never come back here. The girl working behind the counter looked like she hated to be there! It's obvious this place has no one on top of it,running it and it's a shit show. So gonna stay away, food was bad, service was bad, and not clean! I mean how can I even give it one star!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Whenever I'm loafing around and realize I forgot to plan for dinner, this is my go-to place.  The veggie burrito is awesome, and they really load it up.  Anything with the habanero salsa is a hit for me, too.  It's fantastic.  I really like sitting on the outside patio and watching the foot traffic go by on Scottsdale.  Surprisingly good music, to my taste, too."}
{"text":"It can be good, it can be bad. Never attempt to order food for delivery from here. It will take well over an hour and be ice cold and mushy. There is much better drunk food. There is much better sober food.   Chipotle is better than this Qdoba"}
{"text":"Stopped in with my dad after a lunch time matinee at the movies - he is a big fan of their cheese quesadillas, so we went at his suggestion.  First of all... I live near Stonecrest and frequent it often, but for the life of me, I could not find this place.  I had the address thanks to my phone, but the buildings are not marked very well.  I assumed it was near the chunk of restaurants but you cannot see if from driving through the parking lot (you can see if from Rea Rd, but generally I am trying to merge into the turn lane while dodging tiny soccer mom's in giant SUV's who are battling their ill-mannered children while trying to maintain their lane).  This Qdoba is in the same building as JoJo's and Miro's, but it is on the Rea Rd side.  Parking can be a bit of a pain during peak hours on busy weekends, but you'll find a spot.    Staff was nice and expedient.  The restaurant was quite clean with seating inside, as well as outside around the fountain or in the quieter courtyard area.  We ordered our quesadillas, got our drinks and were seated.  Shortly after we received our quesadillas which were hot and oozing with cheese.   Served with sour cream and salsa (I believe... I may have requested both, but I honestly don't remember).  The meal was quite good and reasonably priced.  Dad was happy, which makes me happy, so Qdoba gets a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Richard Z's faux Dallas G review is brilliant. I reward mediocrity if their heart is in the right place. But I knew what I was getting into by going here for lunch. Chipotle. Same story. Rice. THE BURRITO IS ALL RICE. I asked for just a little and I still had a rice burrito. Many of you are saying, but you're a vegan. What do expect? Well, beans, guacamole, tomatoes, pico, salsa, hot sauce, onions... A vegan burrito could be amazing. What I had was white rice. In a tortilla.   For me one star, but I am biased by their meat centric business model. The restaurant was full. People must like it. Two stars."}
{"text":"Well put sarah... but if you want a super quick place for lunch they get you in and out... the food is to be expected... burrtios from a chain resturant..."}
{"text":"The tacos were OK. The guacamole and the chips both had a lime salt on them that was horrible. Two stars is generous, probably won't be back"}
{"text":"Although Qdoba is just one of the many \"Mexican Subways,\" it is in a class of its own. The freshness of the ingredients and the explosive flavors set it far apart from the rest. This particular location is clean and has professional employees.  Having tried just about everything on the menu, I have a few recommendations. Invariably, if you stand in a line at Qdoba, every customer in front of you will order a chicken burrito. Don't do that. Although the burritos are excellent, I would probably rank them last on my favorites list at Qdoba. Instead, try something different.  For meat, I highly recommend the barbecoa (shredded barbecued beef). It sits around simmering in its own juices and spices all day, which cause it to have explosive flavor in every bite.  For dishes, the little known secret and best item on the menu is the tortilla soup. If you're more hungry than soup, get the Mexican gumbo, which has all of the contents of a burrito topped off with the tortilla soup. It doesn't get any better than that. My backup favorite is the quesadilla. They are always crispy and good for dipping in Qdoba's several tasty flavors of salsa (\"hot\" is the best, but they are all great).  The portions can be quite large at Qdoba and it can be hard to decide on which meal to have on a particular visit. Therefore, a nice option is the craft two menu. This allows you to pick two Qdoba dishes, each at a smaller portion than when ordered alone. Hence, you can try two smaller dishes and not get totally stuffed when you eat everything.  Make sure to pick up a Qdoba rewards card at the register. They are free, work at all locations, come with a free chips and salsa at activation, and earn you one free meal for every 10 that you purchase."}
{"text":"Flour taco w/ Chips and Queso are the way to. Hands down better value over Chipotle."}
{"text":"Used to prefer it to chipotle for food quality and taste... the food today was bland and didnt have much flavor. The employees are friendly, the place isnt busy. Not sure ill revisit."}
{"text":"Qdoba is a pretty decent fast-food Mexican place. They care a nice variety of burritos and nachos and everything is pretty tasty considering it's a chain. However, sometimes their burritos are made very sloppily and they leave their nachos out too long and they get stale. If a burrito tears the really should re-wrap it instead of giving it to a customer and no one likes stale nachos. But the killing blow came when they got rid of the Molé burrito. It really set them apart from the competition and their molé sauce was amazingly tasty. Even the more \"authentic\" local restaurants in the area have not made a molé that tasted as good. They replaced it with a rather disgusting BBQ burrito that pales in comparison. Without the molé burrito there really is no reason to choose Qdoba over Chipotle unless you're looking for nachos in particular. Worse yet they keep very inconsistent hours when students are away. I made a trip to campus town especially to try them again and they were closed... so I went to Chipotle instead."}
{"text":"What What?.?.?.... No jalapenos?!?!?!?   What kinda joint is this. well it's flavorless, at least thats my take. The Burrittos Blah! The Tacos Blah! The Nachos Blah! All eiether had NO flavor or The Flavor was off. Its a shame to fill a thin soggy tortilla with 80 cents worth of ingredients and wrap it in such a thin piece of foil that it splits and leaks out of the bag, and charge 8 bucks for it! especially when its as sad as these!!!   I tried it twice and have to pull the plug. My wallet will never again see the light of day in a place like this.  I will say the staff has always been friendly though."}
{"text":"I Have visited this location about four times now, each with a different set of employees I hadn't seen the time before. Food is always good but service is questionable. Two times I tried to visit this location they weren't supposed to be closed for another 30 minutes according to the sign but the doors we locked and they waived me off.  The times I have been able to beat their inconsistent closing they looked like they didn't want me there very much because of the upcoming closing times. Wont visit anymore"}
{"text":"The ever evolving menu changes again, But a coupon made it a decent buy.  I will admit my co workers 2 for 1 coupon is why we went in. This means ~3.25 per burrito vs the usual $6 range.  What I didn't like was that my vegetarian burrito did not have vegetables in it, it was just a bean and rice burrito with guacamole. I don't know how one gets the grilled veggies in their burrito but it is not by ordering a vegetarian burrito.  The drink and napkin station here has always been a bottleneck, getting a refill or more napkins is nearly impossible.  I do like the fact there there is Choula sauce in addition to the red and green tobascos. And I also like that the chairs are not nearly as bad as those at chipotle.  The best tip this time is get in before 12, otherwise be prepared for a long long line."}
{"text":"We had them cater an event for 40 of us and they did not even deliver the entire order and then they had the nerve to tell me to leave my party and come and pick up what they did not deliver. I spoke to the manager the next day she was nice and calmed me down so I gave them another chance and took 8 people with me on Saturday night 3/19/2016 for dinner and guess what, they were CLOSED because they could not get enough workers to staff the restaurant. Manager finally took great care of the problem we are totally 100% satisfied and impressed and they are now fully staffed for business. Thanks again for taking such good care of us we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the white-trash Chipotle. The food is mediocre at best. I mean seriously, how can you just up and steal Chipotle's idea! There's no creativity there. The Habenaro Salsa is flavorless and not hot at all. Seriously? I asked for HOT, not some yellowish tomato concoction for the people who can't handle real salsa!  At least Chipotle has hot salsa (not too hot either but much better) for a fast Americanized mexican food. Of course I much rather have the real deal but I do like Chiptole for what it is. Not this crap that Qdoba tries to serve up.  The chicken is over seasoned and highly spiced/herbed you can barely taste the chicken. The Fajita veggie were the same. The product looked of very low quality. Oxidizing Guacamole and Lettuce. The meat looked unappetizing as well. Just not at the level of Chipotle. Although I have been here twice, this is the last time for me. I have been to one in Denver and for some reason thought it was better. So maybe it's management but I can say the food is less than good. I much rather go to Chiptole than this wannabe! Employees were dumber than a bag of Frijoles! This place has the worst \"Mexican\" Food I have ever had next to a pre made burrito from 7-11 or a burrito from Taco Bell. Just disgusting food."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service at this Qdoba is horrible. Staff seems miserable and very unfriendly. The food is already expensive enough and they want to charge for every little thing. They need to get personalities and learn some customer service skills."}
{"text":"The food is good and inexpensive.  A reasonable number of options for that burrito to choose.  The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is positive.  A clean place.  The portions are reasonable for the money.  A good cheap eat."}
{"text":"Love Q-dobes chicken burrito.  The rice was a little undercooked today, but it still was delicious.  Staff was very friendly.  Place was clean.  Just not much else to report, would go back."}
{"text":"Great alternative for a quick healthy dinner. Can be as healthy or unhealthy as you wish. Enough of variety to make the entire family happy."}
{"text":"Not sure how I feel about Qdoba.  It's one of those things that are up in the air for me.  I mean, I like me some Mexican food every once in a while, and when it's prepared fairly fast I'm down with that.  Even though, I always end up feeling less than fulfilled when I leave there.  I always get my burrito naked with the tortilla on the side.  I think this is the best way to eat it, saving a person from a soggy mess.  Anyway, the inside of this spot is, well for lack of a better term, spotless.  Not much else to say on this spot."}
{"text":"Great place to grab some quick mexifood. Service at this location has been great. Fast and efficent. Try the pick two for a healthier smaller portions!"}
{"text":"I know this place has a ton of terrible reviews, but none of my experiences have been nearly has bad. I work in the area and am obsessed with the chicken tortilla soup, so I visit here whenever I am able to get out.   I have eaten in and taken out. I have never found the place to be extremely dirty, or anything gone wrong while I've been there. The only downfall is that service is typically extremely slow. Even if there is a line, there is no sense of urgency from the staff. They have always been extremely friendly, just not in any rush to get people out the door.   So all in all, it's not a terrible place to eat. Love the food and I couldn't live without the chicken tortilla soup!!"}
{"text":"What happened to this place..first off the food was still good..service was good. The portion size..not so good. I use to come to qdoba for their burritos..i mean they were huge. A meal in itself. The one i ordered today first off barely had any rice on it..then i get rushed thru the line almost forget my veggies get a dollar added onto my bill for sauce and barely any cheese or sour cream. First they close the one closer to my house then i feel cheated when i drive out of my way to enjoy one of my favorite places to eat. Well use to be. I guess next time i will have to risk eboli and go to chipotle or Give moes another chance"}
{"text":"I love the food at Chipotle so much more, I'm not sure I would ever go to Qdoba again because Chipotle has set my expectations too high."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! First time here and we loved it. Got the bowl and added the chips and nacho dip. AMAZING!!! All three kids loved it as well. So so so much better that Chipotle"}
{"text":"This Qdoba is walking distance from where I live and I have avoided this place for a very long time because I love Chipotle and I had a feeling that Qdoba sucked. Qdoba does suck. Everything here is bland the rice, beans, and cheese are bland and the guacamole tasted like lemon paste. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"I have to say I like Qdoba over chipotle about 75% of the time but the reason really isn't taste as i think they are about equal as run of the mill fast-ish mexican food. I like the mexican gumbo here, the taco salad has a tortilla shell, they always have discount coupons, the loyalty program is great and they don't want $1.50 for guacamole on a burrito like the other guys. The location is also good but with the new chipotle across the street (literally) it's Qdoba that wins out.  All that said i tend towards the gumbo,which is really just the burrito guts with tortilla soup on top, with varying meats each time but the new shredder pork is good in it. It's very filling and hits the spot for me. The burritos when i get them are packed full and the chips and queso or guac are always good.  If your looking for a wowing taste of mexican this isn't it but if you need a quick lunch or dinner and want a burrito or some gumbo it's not a bad place. Look in the ASU coupon books for great deals and if you get 10 meals the 11th is on them plus the occasional extra with the loyalty card."}
{"text":"RUN LIKE HELL! This location on Tatum is dirty and attended by lazy employees who don't care. My burrito was prepared by a woman who could barely speak and she ended up spilling rice into the beans container while scooping. An employee behind her decided he was going to serve himself lunch and started helping himself to the food from behind the counter. The manager came out in a huff over something else and started taping paper notes to the counter right in front of me. Never bothered to once look up, acknowledge me, or say hello. She looked like she could barely manage herself, I can bet that she sets a very poor example for her employees.  Vacuum cleaner was parked in open view and near the soda fountain. Totally unacceptable. I took a photo and will be posting it as soon as I figure out how.  Qdoba has a severe management problem, either at this location or at the regional level. I was blown away by the Gig Harbor, WA location - best burrito ever - but could not believe my eyes when I walked into this Phoenix, AZ location on Tatum. Tables are dirty, seats are scratched and peeling, and the most telling sign of all - at peak lunch hour there was NOBODY there. Totally empty. Crickets.  The food containers behind the sneeze guard were dirty, lids were tossed all over the place, and the location looked filthy. You could tell it wasn't cleaned on a regular basis. The soda machine was making a grinding noise, which was the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"Not bad, but from 8pm on they are in closing mode, so you get to dine with the shop vac!"}
{"text":"I was pretty displeased with service here during lunch time the other day. While I know it gets hard to keep up with orders when it is so busy, the worker barely put anything in my naked burrito bowl and nothing looked fresh. It tasted bland and made me never want to come back to Qdoba again. The tortilla soup was alright, but it's pre-made, so that's a given. Meh."}
{"text":"This is a direct competitor for Chipotle.  Frankly, I don't see the difference between them.  They're both good (for what they are).  Big burrito made the way you want pretty quickly.  I can't say it's really authentic, but it is very tasty.  Great for lunch."}
{"text":"I've never been to Chipotle, but I imagine this is what it would be like. It's basically like a Subway...but for burritos. And nicer!  On the boyfriend's recommendation, we split a Queso burrito with chicken. He declared that the burritos here were HUGE so we should just share. I've read about how a Chipotle tortilla was 300+ calories alone and was scared that Qdoba would be the same, so I agreed. I'm not sure if I would agree with his HUGE assessment. The burritos were pretty stuffed and fat, but not very long, if that makes any sense. I probably could have eaten a whole one on my own, but even after nearly 3 years of dating, I like to give the impression of a small, girlish appetite. Plus I ate most of a giant jar of chex mix prior.   Anyhoo, back to the burrito. It was okay, nothing to rave about. I wasn't a huge fan of the liquid nacho cheese sauce inside. I'd come back, but would probably get something else."}
{"text":"So, I decided to check out Qdoba because I got a buy one get one free coupon in the mail - I ate one for dinner last night and saved the other for lunch today. I love Chipotle, so I had high hopes, but man, the food was terrible. i got 2 Naked Burritos - the equivalent of a Chipotle Burrito Bol - one with steak and one with shredded beef. The rice was undercooked - practically crunchy, the shredded beef had a weird aftertaste like it had been stored in plastic, and the rest of it (mild salsa, \"sauteed vegetables,\" cheese, sour cream) was just so, so bland. I ate them both because I'd paid for them, but the whole time I wished I'd just gone to Chipotle. Sigh."}
{"text":"I had 3 Different tacos and this was the first Qdoba I've ever been to. Overall the food was pretty good for what I ordered. Defintely a different taste than most fast food places. Besides the food the place looks esthetically displeasing. There's dirty tables and food everywhere and workers look a bit lazy to do anything. On a Saturday in about an hour I think I saw about 5 other customers come in. Quiet spot and recommend food to go and eat at home."}
{"text":"First I have to say that the food is decent. I wish you could review differently for food v. service! Have you ever been to a restaurant where you feel like you are an inconvenience just by virtue of the fact that you are a customer? The staff here is RUDE and no courteous at all. The food is awesome and that is why I went there but they really nickle and dime you. I ordered the vegetarian burrito and I was told that adding veggies ( TO THE VEGGIE burrito!!) was more than a dollar extra. Another couple said they were overcharged for their chips and salsa. The cashier told me that they now keep all of the hot sauce behind the counter because customer will take it! Next time I will stick with good ol' Chipotle!!"}
{"text":"QDOBA on Central, Park Central Mall - 9/24/13, Tues @ 11:30 am... I was waiting in line for over 10 mins, when I finally got to the girl, she told we they we out of chicken! I don't eat meat or pork, so I ONLY wanted chicken. I flat out said, \"Good-Bye!\" to her & walked out,  as I was walking out, I made sure that I told everyone in line that they were out of chicken. I was very upset!  NO restaurant should ever run out of something like chicken! I would think that a restaurant would be or even should be embarrassed to be running out of a 'staple' such as chicken, don't you think? and the girl was so nonchalant about it, too."}
{"text":"Qdoba why hadn't I tried you sooner, wait it's because I live in Buckeye. Lol I had the three cheese nachos with the green salsa and chicken. I wouldn't like to compare it to Chipotle since all they really have in common is the fact that it's a \"Mexican Grill,\" the flavors are completely different the chicken however does have more flavor.   If I ever find myself downtown again I will definitely stop in again."}
{"text":"Ok so it might deserve 3 stars, because it doesn't stand out as particularly good or bad.  But honestly, why would you come here? It's bland, and more expensive than chipotle. You can get a wet burrito, but it's smaller than a normal one.  After looking it up, it appears to have started in Denver, 2 years after chipotle. later it was bought by jack in the box.  It may have been good when it opened but now it reeks of corporate fast food in which no one cares what the food tastes like."}
{"text":"The grilled chicken taco salad was delicious, customer service was great. I'd definitely go back here."}
{"text":"I actually dont mind Qdoba. This Tempe location was nice. Like the other reviewers have said, It's basically Chipotle. And to me there is basically no difference. The only thing that Qdoba has on Chipotle is that I like the tortillas at Qdoba better, they seem to hold together better."}
{"text":"Poblano Pesto=YUM!  Their craft 2 menu is great.  You choose two items from that menu and you are more than full.   I love the mexican gumbo with black beans and chicken ask for a spoonful of corn salsa on top and it's all good.   My second pick is either two crunchy tacos or the quesadilla (chicken of course).  Delicioso."}
{"text":"I like to eat at Qdoba about once a year.    Every once in a long while, I figure it'd be a good idea to consume 1200 calories in 10 minutes and I file in to Qdoba for a burrito. Yes, they do basically serve Chipotle's menu, but I like Qdoba's better.  Why? Because they offer a bit more variety--the ancho chile bbq burrito is tasty.  Still, you're paying $7 something for a burrito that's bigger than your face.  Take that as either good or bad, depending on whether your concern is gastronomy or cardiology."}
{"text":"Oh man, was I craving a burrito on Sunday.   Chipotle was on the other side of town so I decided to try this place........NOT THE SAME!  First off, they were out of rice because the rice cooker was broken.  ?!?  Not a good start.  So I got a burrito bowl with lettuce and was oh so disappointed!  The salsas here are just not as flavorful and the bean were mushy.  Chipotle, I will never stray again!"}
{"text":"Qdoba--fresh Mexican fast. Great concept, midding to good execution. Walking in, you notice the almost relaxing colors, good atmosphere, and usually a long line to order. Located right near the fountain in Stonecrest, it's a superb location. I've tried both the salad and nachos here. The salad was okay, but they drenched it in beans. Beans, beans, beans! Too many beans! Ugh, kind of ruined it for me. I really enjoyed it when I had it in New York. The nachos were pretty good, although there needed to be more chips for the amount of food they put on the plate.  Overall, it's A-OK, not great, but not bad. I would definitely make this a monthly stop for lunch."}
{"text":"I cannot even begin to explain how disappointed I was with my meal today. My rice was dry. My beans were overcooked. My beef clearly have been sitting there for about three hours before I arrived Because the top was that ugly shade of red that meet turns one it's been sitting under a heat lamp for three hours. My stomach basically felt like a brick was laid since I ate there and I thoroughly regret the decision."}
{"text":"Good food, but the play list is so horrible we could not even have a conversation because of how awful the music that was playing was. I had never heard any of it before and it was awful.  But good food, I'd recommend taking it to go."}
{"text":"I have always been pretty satisfied with these wanna be Chipotle's. Been to a lot of different Qdoba's and the food and service has been  consistently solid.  Until I spent half an hour at this place.   I was one of only 3 customers to come in the whole time. When I walked in both female employees were sitting at one of the tables and chit chatting. They didn't look happy that I walked into their empty restaurant and interrupted their conversation.   One of the girls got up and dragged herself to the counter to see what I wanted. Told her chicken ancho burrito. After she heats up the tortilla she asks me if I want chicken or pork. Not a big deal, but try and pay attention, I know you are extremely busy and all.   When I pay I ask why they are so slow. She says they have been slow all day. Whatever. Get my drink and there's trash at the beverage counter, there's 3 empty napkin holders, trash on the floor, and 4 tables with trash on them.   You would think if they were slow all day the place would be spotless. As I sit there eating my (actually quite tasty) burrito the girls head back to their table and keep on yapping. Fail!  You barely get the 2 stars because the burrito was good."}
{"text":"It's a Qdoba, they serve hot, inexpensive burritos, and they do it well. This location is also rarely busy which makes for speedy lunches or dinners. Can't say anything amazing or awful, but there's nothing wrong with an A-OK \"fast\" food option that can also be healthy."}
{"text":"Chipotle had a line out the door because it's good, but I was in a hurry, so I had to settle on this place. Never any lines to worry about here!  Horrible.  The place smelled like a three inch road trip inside the lower colon of sick deer.  Every employee with whom I spoke had apparently awoken on the wrong side of the bed. Not a smile to be found.   And my lettuce was rotten, wilted and brown. That is inexcusable in a restaurant, and surprising to encounter at a national franchise. Who's in charge here? Makes me wonder whether the meat is beyond its expiration date too.  Stick with the guys whose door is propped open with customers waiting to get in. An empty restaurant like Qdoba speaks for itself."}
{"text":"Can't complain one bit about the exuberant enthusiasm displayed by the young lady working the counter.  Nor did the Groupon lessen the expectation of reasonable satisfaction.  But, after 3 visits here over the past 2 years, sadly, the excitement ends when it comes to the food.  Not really bad, but, I dunno...does the expression \"it's the SIZZLE, not the STEAK\" mean anything to anyone else out there?  Just looking for the one great thing that brings me back, yet I am not seeing it :("}
{"text":"Maybe I got there on the wrong days and nights, but I have never found the employees friendly or helpful. Our server and the  manager were more like automatons than people. Maybe it is because I am 61 and not in their age group. Most places make an effort to greet you and/or learn your name. Not here. Still, the food is fresh and delicious and the TV or music is not blaring. I will continue to eat here but will buy a dog for friendship."}
{"text":"We've only ate here once though that was probably enough.  The two stars is for the food and not for this location in general.    The restaurant itself was nice and clean, with relatively polite staff.  The food variety was that of a typical fast-food Mexican restaurant and nothing more.  If I had to compare the the food with something, I'd say the McDonald's Chipotle franchise, though I'd say the food at Chipotle is somewhat better.  I'd eat here again, but it certainly wouldn't be my first choice --even if I was in need of a Mexican fix."}
{"text":"Excellent Customer Service!!    Yesterday walked over to get my burrito fix and the local Qdoba at Park Central, went through the line got all those yummy fixens and then realized I dropped/lost my money!!! (UGH) I looked at the gal at the register and said hold this I will trace my steps and be back to pay for it... she steps around the counter and hand me my burrito and said \"Merry Christmas\".  I looked at her oddly and said \"What?\" shocked ... again she said \"Merry Christmas have a nice lunch\".  Merry Christmas to you too, walked back to my office ate my yummy burrito.  After the lunch rush slowed down I went back to pay for the burrito, I found her and told her I was here to pay for my burrito... her manager said, \"I have been there have a Merry Christmas are you sure, yes ... have a Merry Christmas,\"  I wished them a Merry Christmas a well.  Now I am not saying they will do this for everyone I just thought my fellow Yelpers should know there are businesses and folks running those businesses that have a heart and understand sometimes you drop your cash or forget your credit card.  I just know they have my business.  Merry Christmas to Everyone!"}
{"text":"Holy crap, how does this place have so many stars!? First off, the food is ok. The first thing the employee does is tell me they have free guacamole and that they are better than Chipotle because they charge. Really, the first thing you do is bash Chipotle Mexican Grill? Which is not only a far more superior restaurant in every way, but also kills your guys quarterly and yearly sales.   Next I had to wait for them to restock the white rice. Which was 1/2 scoop of old rice, and half of the new batch. The second thing I noticed was the rap music playing from the back. It COMPLETELY overpowered the Mexican music playing in the dining area. Who wants to listen to rap when they are eating Mexican food? I know I don't e?e.   After getting the rest of my condiments and chicken out on, the female manager was arguing with an earlier customer about the sizes of some weird bowl or something. I don't even frickin' know. I was standing there with my food getting cold until I said, \"Excuse me, can I pay for my food it is getting cold!?\". Her and the customer apologized and each took a step back. Before my receipt even popped out they were bickering again and I had to point and remind her to give me the receipt! That process took awhile.   By the time I sat down my burrito was completely cold. Some slight warmth coming from the rice, but overall there stoves must of been WAY to low.   Thank god is was great weather out or I would of been stuck inside eating a burrito listening to rap like a cholo.   Would not go back, at least to this location. Will stick to Chipotle from now on.   P.S. Raising your prices to compensate for your FREE guacamole is BS. If you don't get guac you are paying and enflamed price.   This restaurant shouldn't even be allowed in paradise valley. Well, it is next to Walmart..."}
{"text":"This place is so yummy!!! And it's all you can eat Cholula! And not to mention the guac is free with every purchase! Most places charge for guac. The prices here were a little steep but the food is fantastic. Nom nom nom!!!"}
{"text":"I've visited this location way too many times since it opened a couple of years ago.  Give the Queso a try on a burrito or as a side with chips.  Also try the medium salsa on a burrito since it has a lime taste.  I enjoy Qdoba much more than Chipolte because I'm not a fan of red onions.  Chipilte has tons of red onions in everything."}
{"text":"When I saw the coming soon of this Qdoba a while back I was intrigued and just never came by to check it out. I live right around the corner. So, when I checked on here and saw semi decent reviews along with awful ones I was swayed away from trying it. Today I finally checked it out with the fam, we were instantly greeted and given a welcoming atmosphere. I have heard comparison to Chipotle on here and quite honestly I would eat here any day rather than Chipotle just in the friendliness given alone. It is not promoting itself as a fancy restaurant and the prices are reasonable. All in all, we will be back again not just because of the food but also because of the pleasant staff. Awesome service!!! Thank you."}
{"text":"I have always loved Qdoba because of their variety, quality and taste and although those haven't changed, their menu and service seem to vary.  I definitely recommend the craft 2 if you want to get two smaller entrees, it's a great deal.  Two tacos with chips (\"on the side\") and choice of queso and add in *anything* for under $10.  Awesome. Including the price of sour cream in entrees is a bit frustrating as I don't care for them, but this probably is a benefit for most.  My meal was very tasty; I love the salsa roja (spicy) and the flavor of he meat. You always see meat being grilled.  Great place. More locations needed."}
{"text":"Went here to try some tacos on \"Taco Tuesday\", and wow, were we disappointed! Seemed like a decent premise, build your own tacos from the variety of toppings for $1.29 a piece and dig in. Well, that was the intention, anyway.  Two types of vegetarian bean options is the only reason this place is getting more than one star. Would have given it 1.5 stars if possible. The rice was completely flavorless. Beyond bland. Same goes for the salsa, the corn, the guacamole was basically just a smashed avocado with no other seasoning. The chips were awful. I had to over salt everything on my tray to the point my ankles probably swelled to make my food taste like anything. We stared longingly at Chipotle out the window while eating tasteless tacos. I would have rather paid full price across the street! Not a fan of this place at all."}
{"text":"I had never been to a Qdoba before and was driving across town and was looking for someplace that had a menu item that did not have meat.  Mexican inspired places always have bean burritos. As soon as I entered I realized it is very similar to Chipotle. They had a grilled veggie burrito that was listed as vegetarian so I got one.  I think I might have been happier swapping out the rice for onions and peppers but it was a pretty good burrito and wasn't running juice down my arm."}
{"text":"The drink machine was broken which is no big deal, but when we got bottled drinks the coke was expired. The kitchen didn't look like anything had been made in it recently which made me question if my food was fresh. I also noticed a couple staff members being unclean in the kitchen. Overall just felt like the place wasn't well kept and I already don't feel well. Not sure if I would go back."}
{"text":"As you enter you're going to think you've mistakenly walked into a Chipotle...  After eating here, you will have wished you had walked into a Chipotle.  The service is slow and the food is marginal at best.    I spent more than 15 minutes waiting in line for their staff to make a cheese crisp and a bowl.  Come on now.    Burrito looked appetizing, but was cold upon first bite.  This place was a huge let down as I had hoped I found something as good as Chipotle, just closer to work.  No such luck.  :("}
{"text":"I would say this place is similar to Chipolte. My work is close so i checked it out for lunch. I had the puled pork burrito and it was so good. I was not expecting it to be as good as it was. It had pulled pork, grilled red onion & green peppers, rice, pinto beans, sour cream, and hot sauce. These burritos are big enough to eat half and save half for later or split with someone but I ended up eating every single bit of that thing. They have salads and tacos as well. Check it out!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Qdoba Mexican Grill out.  In all honesty, this place is just not good.  The closest I can compare this food too would be day old Taco Bell at three times the price. For the most part, the food did seem fresh (cold but fresh)  and the place was clean but just didn't care for the food. I don't  recommend this place if you can help it."}
{"text":"Passing through on a recent trip to AZ I had a \"Naked Burrito\" with black beans & shredded beef, it was GREAT!! The employees were super friendly & joked with us. Overall an excellent experience! Thanks for lunch! :-)"}
{"text":"The food was great! Now it's like chipotle just more choices to put on top or inside your burrito. I don't think one is better than the other. They are both good! Nachos they were a meal by it self with all the stuff you end up putting in it."}
{"text":"The food is good and so are the options BUT..  The food could be so much better! The food did look like it was left out and was only bothered when a customer walked through the door. The girl who helped me was very nice!   However, the supervisor came to help another customer and her entire attire was just a mess! I felt inclined to tell her to fix herself up. Not out of disrespect but this woman's hair was really bushy and she had white flakes around her entire uniform (she wore a black polo) shirt. I ended up eating the food which was actually pretty decent.   Two weeks later I drove by the place again (to go to Starbucks) and saw the same bushy haired woman through the window. My sister was in the passenger seat and said \"Look at that girl! Why isn't she wearing a hair net?\" I mean this was through the window of my car and the restaurant.  I didn't leave a review before but after seeing that again I thought I should give civilians a heads up. I mean if someone doesn't feel their appearance should be maintained while at work, then who knows how they run the place - especially a supervisor!  Thank God I didn't get sick because I noticed some reviews said they had. If you decide to eat here you better pray over your food."}
{"text":"Now that they've opened a Q'doba in Old Town, we don't come to this location very often.  However, they seem to make larger sized portions at this one.  The Queso Sauce is still very addicting....I crave it from time to time.  We come to this location when we don't feel like driving to Old Town and dealing with the late night tomfoolery down there.  This one is situated in a normal shopping area.  As long as it stays open, we'll keep coming back.  Return Factor - 80%"}
{"text":"Thanks to Groupon I found this place.  It's relatively new to Old Town, just opening around a year ago (guess)?  Anyway, I've been meaning to try it, but until the Groupon deal came out, I just didn't seem to find time to do so.    I like Q'doba restaurant...very familiar.  We ordered:  Chicken Burrito http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qdoba-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=-eALv7wqWx_1qojO_NdGHA#-eALv7wqWx_1qojO_NdGHA  Chips http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qdoba-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=6M1tRnAA9WWmIKgO6URXYg#6M1tRnAA9WWmIKgO6URXYg  When you come here, you have to have their Queso in your Burrito....so I ordered mine with the Queso.  It's soooo good and addicting.  The Chips are ok...what more could you ask from Chips, right?  The employees who work here are friendly and got our order right.  Since they're in Old Town, they have a lot of competition for food joints.  I hope they make it.  Return Factor - 60%"}
{"text":"I don't understand all the hate for this place. Like the guy before me said \"clearly the refried beans have gone to your head.\" There are so many more choices here and the food is flavorful. Plus, how can you not love queso sauce? ARE YOU NOT HUMAN???  I'm a little 110 pound girl but I love big portions so the amount of meat and everything else they heap on there is amazing. Plus they seem to always have quality meat. More than once I have stopped by a Chipotle, the barbacoa tasted and had the texture of meat that had been chewed and then someone decided they didn't want to swallow it and put it back in the meat bucket.   Well I'm not here to rag on Chipotle, but I am here to tell you what a yummy place you're missing out on. I understand everyone has a bad day and maybe one time they had crappy rice or something, but who are you to judge something after one experience? My favorite sushi place has had one bad day, I never judged them on it and you shouldn't either.  I'd recommend this place as a great lunch spot, it's quick and delicious. Don't forget the queso :D"}
{"text":"I'll post my actual review before I share the background story so those who are not interested can move on. Basically, the food is as mediocre as any other fast food Mexican grill, but the service is far worse!  The first and only time I set foot in this establishment was a brisk, fall afternoon as a freshman at the University of Illinois. My order was simple - all I wanted was burrito, without the meat. As the server relays my order to the other employees, he makes a quip in Spanish about how difficult we vegetarian customers are, not knowing that I also speak Spanish. I ignored his rude comment and went about my merry way, but I have never returned to this day. I can only imagine what might happen if I did..."}
{"text":"There is a lot of Qdoba hatin' going on here and I'm not sure why.  I have to be honest and say that I used to eat at Qdoba constantly as a college student in Michigan.  Then I found out the nachos that I ate once a week were over 1400 calories.  I felt gluttonous and terrible and stopped frequenting the place.    When I moved out here, I was a bit sad to see that Qdoba's are not exactly easy to find.  However, this Qdoba happens to be on the way to the boy's house and I've grown up and decided that I can order a taco salad style meal and be happy with it and not have it be 1400+ calories.    I get the naked taco salad with grilled veggies- so good.  I went twice in the last week and both times they grilled fresh veggies for me which was nice.  I'm a fan of their pico de gallo and the red hot.  As far as this location goes, the staff are super friendly and the actual restaurant has been clean.  I'm not a big fan of Chipotle as everything seems to have way more calories than it should, and I much prefer Qdoba to it."}
{"text":"This place is located in stone crest shopping center which is really happening place on Thur/Fri evening. The store is always clean, employees with big smile on their face and one thing which I love is that they let you know if any topping you are getting would cost you anything extra. I usually go to Q at least once a week. I love Mexican food and Q is the only place which will meet my expectation in short time I have to grab lunch. Most of the time I need to take it to go since I only have about 20 mins to get my lunch between conference calls."}
{"text":"Ate here today for lunch.  Beautiful area. Food is just as good as Chipolte (which I favor). Had a steak burrito with torstitos and hot sauce."}
{"text":"I previously gave Qdoba 3 stars due to them not telling me about the cost of extras like veggies and guac which they used to charge extra for, but no longer.  Now the guac and fajita veggies are added at no extra cost. That was a nice policy change since the first time I went there they did not tell me about the extra charges.    I have to say that after eating at Qdoba, I like their food more than Chipolte.  The Mexican Gumbo is good with the shredded beef.  Their chicken is still chopped up a bit too small for my liking, but it does have good flavor.  I usually get the tacos, bowl or gumbo, but in the past I have tired the burritos and nachos.  Their chips are pretty good and now that they have some other quesos (three I believe) I could see their nachos being pretty good.    They also have a club card which saves some cash, especially when you are the person who makes the food run for the office :D  I have gotten a couple meals for free already thanks to the points on the card.  The folks at Qdoba are always great, even when I have rolled in at 5min to closing (which I hate to do, but it happens)."}
{"text":"They load you up with food here, it's a buffet of beans, cheeses, and salsa.  I still prefer Chipotle, but they do have good Mexican beers here and that is always a great treat at lunch.  I can really never finish my platter in a single setting, so I save it for a midnight snack.  I have noticed that the food gets a little soggy later, but that is expected in a Tex-Mex dish.  I thought their guacamole tasted extra fresh and delicious, but overall it wasn't anything out of the ordinary.  Good place for a quick lunch on the run."}
{"text":"This location is pretty consistent. I have always taken my food to-go, so I can't vouch for the cleanliness of the seating area.  Veggie nachos are my jam. Queso!"}
{"text":"It's fast food Mexican, however it's great for an inexpensive meal.    There is a fair choice and Taco Tuesdays with $1.29 tacos is a great deal."}
{"text":"Qdoba at Park Central Mall is the only Qdoba located in the state of Arizona. Is there a reason for this? I'm not sure, but if you want a decent burrito in a hurry then check this place out.   Consistently during the busy lunch rush, there is a line out the door and beyond for Qdoba. Maybe I'm missing something or maybe its patrons are just doing the best with the closest selection of lunch places to choose from.   You get the standard fillings... beef, chicken, pork and your choice of beans and cheeses. It's fairly run of the mill and I've been to better \"fast food\" burrito places. More than likely I'd go to the competition first, but if I'm running out of time before work and I'm craving a burrito that isn't obtained by making a run for the border, I might be tempted to go again."}
{"text":"Imagine Chipotle with more flavor.  It's almost a complete ripoff of Chipotle's concept, but with the welcome twist of more interesting meat, sauce, and cheese options.    I'm not big on 2lb. burritos, so I wouldn't frequent Qdoba, but it's certainly worth a visit every once in a while."}
{"text":"Get the guac...so bomb!! The ingredients are fresh and the service is fast. I often ask my girl to bring a burrito home because there is a Qdoba MG across the street from where she works.  I have become addicted to the Q. The only thing I don't like about this place is that the prices are a little steep. It is about 7 bucks for a burrito.   However, as stated earlier, the guac is bomb and the food tastes so fresh for being a fast food joint."}
{"text":"I have stopped by here three different times in the past month to eat a variety of meals.  The outside of this Qdoba looks like all Qdoba's do with nothing special to differentiate it as your would expect from a chain.  The inside is always clean and nice while also being spacious, much more so than some of their other restaurants.  I actually prefer to come to this location over some of their others because of that and also because it never seems to be super busy.  Half of that is probably because this Qdoba is on one side of McKnight Road which has a center lane divider which can make it a little hard to get to.  The past few times I have been there I have had a steak salad, chicken queso burrito and plain chicken burrito all with brown rice and black beans.   All of it has been really good although it is never exceptional.  What I really like about Qdoba that makes it different from all of the restaurants in the same vein is that they now allow you to get brown rice and also that they have a habernero salsa to put on what you have ordered.  Since I love spicy food, that is huge for me.  The bottom line for me is that I will definitely stop by this Qdoba again.  The fresh quality ingredients that you get for a reasonable price are nice.  I also know that I will enjoy my meal if I eat here as they always deliver."}
{"text":"I don't understand the lack of love here for Qdoba. Maybe everyone has been sucked into the Chipotle burrito-sphere and the refried beans are affecting their brains. There are enough tortillas in the world to support more than one fast food burrito joint, people!  Don't get me wrong. I like Chipotle too. I will enjoy a burrito bowl there from time to time. But Qdoba has one thing Chipotle doesn't offer - their queso dip. A squirt of cheesy heaven, Qdoba's queso makes everything taste better.   My favorite thing to get is their nachos. They load 'em with beans, your choice of meat, salsa, cheese, sour cream and 3-cheese queso. YUM! You get a heaping serving of salty yumminess for like $6.00. If I'm starving I can finish a whole plateful but there is certainly enough to share.  So do yourself a favor and indulge in a little queso therapy next time you're craving some fast mexican food. You may never visit Chipotle again."}
{"text":"We are not local to AZ and love qdoba. Drove an hour to this location and they were closed for the day at 5:30. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"I went here once and then went back to try it again. After entering and observing, I realized that this was going to be the same exact underwhelming experience as the first time. As a matter of fact, they are pretty much a factory of that exact experience. Kind of annoying.   The food was salty. Really salty. I've had so much better Mexican...I don't understand this place being successful here. I can only imagine that it is because we have so many transplants here in AZ and they have trouble trying places they don't recognize the name of.   Its OK people. There are real Mexican's here who have been making food for years! Go to one of your local places, check it out. It will destroy this corporate blandness that has salt as its only spice.  You are on Yelp, you could look for a place near you! A Mexican place that only exists here in your town! Has no other locations 2500 miles away from Mexico. Its OK to adventure out of what you know! Its actually why some of us are Yelping, so you can go to the places that are good, not the ones that suck."}
{"text":"Rude service. I sat at the bar section near the window and noticed nasty food gunk caked to the window and dead bugs on the sill. The rest of the dining area was pretty clean, to be fair. With all the amazing Mexican food options in the Phoenix area, there's no reason to waste your time at this place. The food? Meh..."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely terrible at this Qdoba, or maybe it is all Qdoba's I don't know.  Either way, Qdoba does not stack up to Chipotle.  Better than Someburros?  Nope.  Better than Filliberto's?  Not quite.  Better than Taco Bell?  Doubtful.  Better than a Hot Pocket?  Yes, but what isn't?"}
{"text":"Horrible food, only slightly more Mexican than Taco Bell. Also pretty much identical to Chipotle, which might be slightly better. Their meat is dry, burritos are flavorless, and the salsa doesn't help in either category. Not worth the price. Also the lines at lunchtime can be ridiculous, which is sad."}
{"text":"So, freaking amazing! My fiancee and I eat here frequently because the quality and value of the food is top notch. I will say that of every thing that I have tried, I did not care for the seasoned ground beef tacos. My personal favorite item is the 3 cheese queso burrito. Eat early if you are going to get burritos because they are huge and will fill you up for the rest of the day!"}
{"text":"My favorite place but went this weekend and they were gone :( so sad I really like this place guess I'll call and see if other locations are still around too"}
{"text":"I used to go here frequently, but I got sick of being charged for every extra thing (peppers, sour cream, etc).  In the end Chipotle ends up being higher quality AND cheaper if you get the extras.  On top of that, their hours are all over the place.  Chipotle is open more frequently.  The only reason to go here now is the Queso burrito, but the downsides outweigh the good.  It's worth waiting in line at Chipotle."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian choices. Very clean and nice patio area."}
{"text":"Just like everyone else said, similar to chipotle. Not great but not bad.  Came for their promo on Mango Mojo BOGO - salad or burrito. I got the salad with the tortilla shell. The girl serving didn't exactly look happy to be there and mumbled when she asked me questions but no big deal. Salad was good overall the pieces of lettuce were really big that you have to cut it into pieces yourself. For those who like spicy, their mango hot salsa is maybe closer to medium so those who like medium, order spicy. For those who like spicy, try adding their non-mango spicy salsa.  Hopefully that will help up it a notch."}
{"text":"I still haven't decided whether I like Chipoltle or Qdoba better; it's a close call. Either way you can get a huge  vegan burrito for under $6, how can you complain about that?  Bonus for Qdoba is that their pinto beans are Vegan(Chipolte's are not). I usually grab rice, black beans, fajita veggies, corn, hot salsa, lettuce, gauc - done. They also have some veggie tacos and another grilled veggie burrito but I usually go for the staple above(make it more healthy with a bowl, no rice, double black beans).  The service is usually friendly enough and consistent. My family and friends in the far reachs of Northeast New England long for Qdoba - I am not sure if I would go that far but it satisfies this Vegan."}
{"text":"Good place, just like Chipolte but with a little more options it seems like, went there the other day and no one was inside, got my food quickly, I didn't oder a drink so the cashier offered me a water cup with out me asking, very friendly."}
{"text":"Food itself is still great, but these new owners don't understand the importance of Cholula. We came here a few weeks ago and they were out of Cholula and only had Tobasco (yuck), now they are out of both. C'mon, get it together!  The Tempe location always has plenty."}
{"text":"Unlike other reviews I had a rather pleasant experience at Qdoba's.  It was my first time there and I loved the food.  I am not a fan of spicy food and that has to be the reason I prefer this place over chipotle.    The steak tacos were fairly high quality as far as taste goes for $6 tacos.  There 3 cheese sauce was a little spicy but a new taste for me that I thoroughly enjoyed."}
{"text":"Must of been a bad day- I had a burrito bowl and my boyfriend had two tacos. My steak turned into mush in my mouth, and one bite I had to spit out into a napkin. I was really disappointed in my experience.   However, the reason I gave this review such a low rating because of the horrible customer service. The young woman behind the counter was so stand off-ish towards us both. She made it seem like I was interrupting her, I guess, because every time I asked a question she replied with an attitude or nothing at all. She threw my bowl down on counter when I asked for a flour tortilla. I had no complaints or problems so I'm confused by the whole situation...  I am a server and a bank teller, and I work with people every day, so my advice to her is keep a smile on your face! I have had my fair share of horrible days, but your customers really notice! Have to sadly say as her customer, won't be returning. :("}
{"text":"The food was not bad at least it was better than Filiberto's or any other Mexican fast food place. The setting  reminds me of Chipolte and Baja Fresh.  The service was friendly, and the food was   tasty. I've had the Vegetarian Taco Salads, Cheese Quesadillas and Vegetarian Burritos here. Unlike other Qdoba's, this one does not serve breakfast, but the portions are better and bigger than Taco Bell.  They picked a great location because it is next to Starbucks and the Good Egg, so you can pick up free wi-fi.  It is right on the light rail, so this place is accessible if you do not have a car."}
{"text":"Though we love Qdoba in general, this location specifically left me unimpressed.  The young lady who fixed our food skimped on everything. And then she managed to APPEAR to scan my Frequent Eater card without actually doing so.  The points never appeared on my card. My bad that I couldn't find my darned receipt later, to prove to corporate that we'd actually eaten there.  No worries though because this location is totally out of our radius. We were only there that day because our daughter had an activity in the area and we love Qdoba.  The free concert in the square and the ice cream from the shop close to the parking lot totally made up for it.  Mid July visit..."}
{"text":"i dont eat the burritos here. i'm that annoying person who gets the same thing every time (chicken nachos) --- but why fix something that isn't broken?! yes, the caloric level is ridiculous... i even took off a star for it. but its cheap. and good. and reminds me of college."}
{"text":"4 Stars for Qdoba...  I eat here often, mainly because i'm one of the cheapest people you will ever meet when comes to getting lunch, and mainly because I use their Qdoba points card which gives me a free burrito after I buy 10 or something...   I would normally rate them 3 stars because it's usually \"just ok\", but when you can catch them at their prime lunch time, everything just seems so freakin BOMB!!  Go Qdoba!"}
{"text":"I ordered the burrito bowl and it was very tasty. The manager was very nice. The restaurant was clean. It is up to par with Chipotle. Their steak may even be better than Chipotle. No grizzle. You know what I'm talking about if you've ever had a steak burrito at Chipotle. The price was fair."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant by paradise valley mall. Have huge tortillas and a very nice looking menu."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and we were starving! I found the general experience to be similar to Chipotle but honestly the food was better.  I had a burrito with chicken and guacamole that didn't come with and extra charge.  Chips and salsa, great environment, I've found a new favorite!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Qdoba.  And I must say, I really enjoyed the Mango Chicken Salad.  Had wthat with lots of pico and verde salsa with no cheese or sour cream....no tortilla bowl.  Pretty tasty!  Its too bad today was the last day they're offering the Mango Salsa as it is a seasonal item.  :(    I'll be back though!  Most likely only on Wednesdays when they offer my company lunch deals via email.  :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I have always had a good experience here.  We've tried the tacos salads, gumbo, and queso nachos.  GO QUESO!  All the food was hot, fresh, and full of flavor.   My husband does not like spicy food at all.  He got their shredded beef taco salad.  He enjoyed the taste of the shredded beef.  I personally did not like it.  A little bland for me.    I'm all about the spicy food.  I enjoyed the steak meat.  YUM! Their own chipotle salsa is super spicy and yummy.  The gumbo is to die for.  Wow!  Really good peeps, try it out!     We got decent portions for the price.  Around $25 for 2 make your own taco salads/soup/gumbo, plus their queso nachos&drink add on.  Can't beat that.  The customer service was great.  Every time we went in, the same manger was there and he was nice, to the point, fast and patient with us.  Not sure why everyone is downing this place cause they are \"like\" Chipotle.  Personally I think Chipotle is way over priced and my burrito never stays together.  It's a whole mess.  My husband agrees.  We will choose Qdoba over Chipotle any day."}
{"text":"Today I came to this qdoba and found a server getting a meal ready with out his gloves on. Then this lady failed to make my burrito even half way decent. Then the entire time I'm ordering I have to repeat myself over and over again. Ever since this qdoba went under new management it has gone downhill very fast. I used to come here 3 times a week now I'm hesitant to ever come back."}
{"text":"It seems like every time I turn around at Stonecrest, there is another place that I haven't eaten. Maybe they just keep closing and opening in the same location and I can't remember. Or maybe after turning around so many times I'm dizzy and can't recall. I really don't know - sometimes I feel like there are corners of this center where I get lost.  Whatever the case, this time, we stopped at Qdoba because we didn't recall eating there, and felt like something a little different. Of course, it's different for Stonecrest options, since we couldn't recall eating there, but it's just like every other Qdoba. Nothing much special about it.  Shuffle in as the line gets long at times, stare at the menu and try to figure out what you want, look over the glass and determine what you want on the burrito (or whatever option you prefer). Pay.  What I really don't get - while I appreciate the counter and all - is why can't they make it so you can see what's happening back there a little better? I don't want to sneeze in the beans or anything, but I'm a tall person, and there are times I can't figure out what I want on my quesadilla. Plus, I like to watch. Er, look.  Think Subway - I want to see what's going on. I like that the lids keep it warm and all, but No sense putting it out in front if you can't see what's going on you know. Give me a little more room is all.  The good thing is that service is generally nice enough - except they keep hiding something behind those lids. I'll figure it out one day."}
{"text":"I like custom made burrito shops, and one of these popped up near my house. I figured it would be a nice change of pace from Chipotle until I walked in the door and realized... Chipotle, with a different logo. The offerings were virtually identical, except that the quality was obviously lower, visibly lower, as in looking over the sneeze guard it seemed as though I was peering at a cheap Chinese knock-off of a successful business model. It's hard to find good fast-food guacamole, and Chipotle's is THE best fast food guac, period. What the Qdoba employee was scooping onto my burrito was an insult to good guacamole. The overall flavor was flat and not-fresh. It's no surprise that the location by my house closed, and I'm shocked that any are still in business."}
{"text":"Talk about delishhhh!   An awesome person (Martin) introduced me to this place. OMG their food is excellent. I tried the chicken, the beef, white rice, red rice, the salsas they are ALL on point. This is definitely my new favorite spot. I recommend that you try it. I loved it and I'm picky I'm sure you will love it too. I will definitely be a regular starting today"}
{"text":"This place is tolerable.  If you're looking for a lot of food, this is the place to go.  It's a tad cheaper than Chipotle (in chicken burritos) and offers a few more options (such as quesadillas, etc.).. but I really think that it misses in taste in comparison.  They also charge for things like green peppers and onions... I don't like that.  There is ample seating though.. and they actually have pretty cheap beer.  I appreciate the fact they have green beer on unofficial St. Paddy's day (without the cover)."}
{"text":"I stopped in to pick up dinner one night after the line for Chipotle was nearly out the door. I'm doing a low carb thing so I opted to try their naked salad bowl - lettuce, chicken, black beans, cheese, guacamole, and hot salsa. It was good - a different variety than the Chipotle salads. I would come back, though probably not for their burritos. I would like to try the other items on their menu"}
{"text":"My first Q'doba experience also happened to take place in Madison, WI where I would visit a good friend of mine while living in the Chicago area. This was back around '99-'00 or so, I believe, and I'd never experienced a Chipotle to compare it to. I really enjoyed it at the time, so much so that when I moved to Michigan I would occassionally drive almost an hour to get to the closest one. I was pretty psyched when the one on Rural opened up out here because Chipotle never sits right in my stomach (not that it necessarily stops me...but I always dread the impending doom that eating there brings). Unfortunately, this wasn't exactly the Q'doba I remembered, and it's just sorta average. I like the chicken, but the steak is blah. Queso is ok, but I've had much better. This is the one place where I actually enjoy the flavor of their green salsa, and I like the hot as well. No salsa complaints here. I usually end up spending just slightly less for my order here versus at Chipotle, which consists of three tacos, a drink, and chips and salsa (queso at the Q)."}
{"text":"It has been awhile since I've been to Qdoba because I've always been a Chipotle fan. However I came across a Groupon for 2 Entrees, 2 large drinks, chips & queso for $14. Normal price is a little over $26.  My hubby and I decided to go for lunch. I ordered 3 soft tacos for my entree. My hubby ordered a Smothered Burrito. My tacos were good. I asked for chicken, mild salsa, a smidge of sour cream, lettuce and cheese. My hubby got mild salsa and guacamole with his burrito. He also ordered their hottest sauce but said it wasn't very hot. The chips had the right amount of salt and they were warm.  The restaurant and the bathrooms were clean and the employees were friendly. I like that you can get nachos and quesadillas here because you can't at Chipotle. Since Chipotle has been going down hill we'll probably be heading to Qdoba instead."}
{"text":"The two things I really like about QDoba are 1) Quesadillas!! and 2) guacamole at no extra charge!!!  I added rice to my quesadilla this trip and it was messy because it kept falling out. My hubby got a burrito bowl with the new bacon jalapeño queso. He said it was mostly bacon flavored and not much jalapeño, but he enjoyed it. We also had chips and queso. I think I could live on those."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for Qdoba to open up a location in Scottsdale since I moved here a year ago. It was my go-to place in college since they were open 24/7 on the weekends and the price, quality, and options are so much better than Chipotle. However, I know a lot of people who would argue that Chipotle is better.  I almost always get their Craft 2 Menu with 2 chicken tacos and a chicken quesadilla. It's enough food to last me 2 meals, unless I'm really hungry. Their queso is really good too, especially in a queso burrito or burrito bowl.   The staff was very friendly and offered to get us refills and helped to clean away our finished plates. They just opened up so some of the workers are still under training and becoming more efficient.   I usually don't bother to write reviews for chains but I figured I'd leave the first review here because I love Qdoba that much... and you should too :)"}
{"text":"We used Qdoba catering for an event at my work this weekend, and I am so happy we did! We did the burrito bar and added queso dip. It was awesome. Everything was well made, from the rice to the chicken to the salsa. The crew that brought things up/refreshed the bar midway was friendly, courteous, and fast. The food was a big hit!   In planning the event, the woman I spoke with was so nice, so knowledgeable, and made helpful suggestions. I was supposed to bring a crockpot for the dip and completely forgot, but it was no problem- she went right down to the store and god another sterno, and we were good to go!   I will definitely be back, both for catering and as a regular 'ol retail customer."}
{"text":"GONE! The worst Qdoba on the planet, the blot on the face of Qdobosity, has a hastily inked sign taped to the door announcing: \"This store is closed. Thank you for your support.\"  Goodbye, horrible Qdoba with clerks of apathy and despair! Goodbye, tasteless food served with a side of hopelessness!"}
{"text":"First time here. Went with the craft 2 menu and thanks to the team member, I followed her recommendations. On the fence so I will try again next time I am in the neighborhood. Have to be honest- I am very loyal to Chipotle so there was a lot of comparing and contrasting going on."}
{"text":"Qdoba is just another cheap Mexican place (very similar to Chipotle) but it's still really good!  Expect the usual combinations of rice, bean, meat, etc... but they have a wider variety of choices like taco salads and quesidillas too.  The place was clean and the staff was quick, helpful and polite.  Plus Qdoba offers a frequent buyers card and you can redeem your \"points\" for free food.  Eveybody like free food!"}
{"text":"Qdoba is pretty simple, form a line, tell the dude what you want, he makes it and you eat it. Its like Subway for burritos. Awesome!  I usually like to go to Chipotle, but this Qdoba pulls me away.  1. They move through he line with a quickness I have never seen before. 2. The staff is really friendly and they always at least act semi happy to are in their store.  3. It's clean and has a nice patio i can chilax on while on a break from work. 4. They meat quality if better then other burrito places 5. They have more options.      two different kinds of veggies     cheese sauce, high five!     gumbo     and a combo option so if you cant make up your mind between a quesadilla or            tacos, you can have both, or gumbo and a salad  Qdoba = winning!"}
{"text":"Person 1: \"So, where do you want to go to lunch?\"  Person 2: \"Hmmm.  I'm not sure\"  Person 1: \"Want to go to Paradise?\"  Person 2: \"Naaah, we've been there three times recently.\"  Person 1: \"What about Subway?\"  Person 2: \"I'm so damned tired of sandwiches. . .\"  Person 1: \"Well, here's Qdoba.\"  Person 2: \"Qdoba?  Okay, I haven't been there in a while.  We can get in and out pretty quickly and get back to work.\"  That's pretty much how it is.  Nobody really plans to go out and eat at Qdoba.  It's one of those places you decide to go to on the fly or because you've eaten everywhere else.  The Mexifood is fair.  Nothing special, nothing bad, nothing to distinguish it.  There's tons of Mexican joints within ten miles that are better, but Qdoba's here in this strip mall.  Haven't eaten here in a while and don't want to drive any further?  This will make a nice alternative, and then you'll be good on this place for another six months or so. . ."}
{"text":"It's no Chipotle but a good alternative when in a hurry between Lowe's & home. Family was going to kill each other unless we ate so we stopped at the first (non-fast food) place we found."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but if you choose Qdoba over Chipotle, then sit down, son - we need to have a talk."}
{"text":"Qdoba was recommended through a co-worker who assured me they were \"just as good as Chipotle\". Well, being just across Thomas and 10-15 minutes closer made it infinitely more convenient. Almost walkable, if you don't mind getting flattened by the new Light Rail whizzing by. As Stephen Wright says, \"Anywhere is walking distance....if you have the time.\"  Well......about halfway through my fajita ranchera burrito, I'm already sadly disappointed. Taste, quality and price are all below my precious Holy Sepulchre of the Chipotle temple.   First off, I decided to try the fajita, since it's what I get from (angels sing) Chipotle, so it would make the best comparison. I always ask for, and get, some extra peppers/onions for a perfect, albeit \"Chain\", burrito. So I was a little shocked by the \"We'll have to charge you for that\" response.   For about 4 pieces of pepper and onion. No joke. Hard times, Qdoba??  The rice is thinner and smaller than Chipotle's, and the burrito instantly fell apart. I guess they need to send their employess to the same rolling-and-folding school that Chipotle includes in their tuition reimbursement benefits.  The final price was over $9, 2 bucks more then I pay at Chipotle for the same - no, better - food.  Sorry, Qdoba, Jeffrey doesn't want burritos with good taste, he wants burritos that taste good! (and cost less)"}
{"text":"Qdoba does work! Love the new menu and the queso is out of this world. The chicken queso burrito is the busness. Dont get that smothered nonsense, get the naked burrito And get yourxelf some chips. Best nachos youve ever had and you wont get soggy chips. Its quick, its like 8 bucks but you dont havw to tip and its alot of food. The whole place is simple quick and awesome."}
{"text":"the most disgusting restaurant ive been to! do not go to it the employees are fine except for the fact they don't smile so I feel uninvited and not welcomed! Go to the chipotle by Paradise Valley Mall!!!!!! They're 100X better than Qdoba...."}
{"text":"Good place with healthy, fairly flavorful mexican fastfood and good prices. Similar to chipotle- but a tad lower end. Hub likes their beans and rice but still prefers the pork at chipotle a bit more.   I prefer this place to Chipotle so not sure why everyone says different?? The veggies have more flavor plus they have way better options than chipotle. Plus their chips are better too.     . I usually hate queso but qdoba's has peppers and great spices: its addicting! also love their salty chips. The 2 kinds of extra grilled veggies are great add in but get annoyed that they charge extra even if i skip the rice, cheese.. And then they are even skimpy with their veggie portion.  Hot red salsa is really good but dont care for the others. Service is friendly but not consistent when it comes to charging items or knowing whats a \"naked burrito, salad...\".     Love their frequent buyer program but the customer service from corporate is awful.  Reached out to them twice to get credit for meal when I have forgotten my card (why they cant look up my account with my email or phone number is crazy) but never get replies from their corporate office."}
{"text":"I like Qdoba WAY better than chipotle. Their meat never has grizzle on it and is very flavorful and tender. Their fajita vegetables are always crisp and never overcooked. Most importantly: free quacamole!  They have really tasty salsa options and Queso!  Seriously, I pick Qdoba over chipotle every day of the week."}
{"text":"You know what differentiates a lot of tomato based Mexican food from fucking Italian? Oregano and basil, both of which were in your \"hot\" salsa today. I put quotation marks around that because I guess it was supposed to be spicy but it tasted more like sloppy joe mix than chiles. I didn't ask for a freakin' Mexitalian burrito.  Consistently the worst pseudo-Mexican food in the business.   The best thing that can be said for it is it'll form a turd. Pure fuel, not food."}
{"text":"Saw the ad for this place on Hulu commercials actually lol came in and reminded me of Chipotle but the food was actually pretty good! I will come back most likely. We tried basically one of each of the tacos. They're all great to be honest. Food tastes fresh and had a crunch with the veggies and steak was awesome. Perfect tacos."}
{"text":"Went to Qdoba for lunch and there was a long line, which is to be expected around 12:30 on a workday. Didn't take too long to get up to the counter though. I ordered a burrito bowl with chicken, white rice, pinto beans, cheese, and a little sour cream. The girl behind the counter actually listened and didn't overdo the sour cream. Very much appreciated. They have the Coca Cola Freestyle machine, but I got iced tea. The drink station is kind of awkward with the placement of the lids and utensils. Not really a logical flow and feels congested. It was a nice day so we sat at a table outside. Lots of people eating around there. I very much enjoyed my burrito bowl. I think their chicken is so much better than Chipotle's. They really need a Qdoba on the west side in Avondale/Goodyear!"}
{"text":"This location was converted to a \"Central Taco\" on Friday June 26, 2015.  I have a sneaking suspicion that the \"Central Taco\" is really just a front to get rid of the leftover food from Qdoba.  Does anyone know what happened?"}
{"text":"I hope this is the right location (directly across from Chipotle).  Okay, this review is way, long overdue (like since December 2013), however, I must say while in town helping brother & family move- hubby and I worked up an appetite, as well as the rest of the crew.  So we were craving some good south-of-the-border place and figured we'd go to the local Chipotle Grill- but it was so busy and we were so hungry, someone suggested the Qdoba Mexican Grill right across the street from Chipotle.  Never heard of this place, as I don't think we have any here in So. Cali, but once we got in and met the friendliest counter girl, Anna, my nephew recognized her from an earlier Christmas party and her smile grew even bigger.  I didn't believe their food could be better than Chipotle, but after we satisfactorily satiated our appetites, I vowed to go back each and every time we make our way out to Arizona.  Yumm and delish is all I can say for Qdoba.    The queso sauce was lip-smacking good as each of my tortilla chips took multiple dives in that well seasoned, warm, saucy deliciousness.   The Mexican Gumbo (sounds funny) but it was so good as I got to add whatever ingredient I wanted inside of that bowl of yummyness.  5 solid stars for Qdoba and the same for the waitress/food handler Anna!!!  If only we had a Qdoba in So. California, tsk, tsk."}
{"text":"This is a great fast food Mexican restaurant.  The queso is best thing to try on the menu.  Coworkers go here every week for lunch.  This place could be a 5 star location except sometimes the service is slow.   You definitely want to get there before 11:30 for lunch."}
{"text":"I've visited this location 3 times in the past month or so.  The first visit was perfect, but the last 2 visits on Saturdays have been horrific.  The food would have been acceptable if it didn't get ice cold as the staff prepared our entire order.  We are a family of 5 so I expect it to take a few minutes to prepare our food, but 10+ minutes, come on!  They appear to be either under staffed or just don't give a crap.  Not sure what to do, my boys prefer Qdoba over Chipotle, but this service is making it tough to come back.  At least with Chipotle, we know our food will be warmer than room temp."}
{"text":"For fast food burritoes, I DEFINITELY choose Qdoba over Chipotle.  Eww Chipotle.  Gross Chipotle.  I won't even go for the free burrito day at Chipotle.  But anyway, back to Qdoba.  They have some good burritoes.. my sister loved any of the ones with their queso sauce, and I have to say I used to love their Chicken Mole burrito (not authentic, but still so good that it didn't matter), but I don't think they have them anymore?  I tried a bbq sauce one that seemed like it was close to that flavor, and it wasn't bad, but it wasn't no mole, if you get my meaning.  Wink wink, nudge nudge.. yeah, I don't know why that requires a wink wink, nudge nudge."}
{"text":"Oh dear sweet Mango Salad! Your mix of fresh flavors refreshes me on a hot Arizona day. This SoCal girl is not used to 109 degree weather. But your air conditioned restaurant kept me cool. Although a tostada shell filled with lettuce, corn salsa, black beans, mango and guacamole sounds like a weird combination, I would eat you all over again! http://bit.ly/NXExhI  Yessss :D"}
{"text":"I really love qdoba. I don't get to eat here as often as I'd like bc I don't live right by one, but when I get there I am reminded how sad that makes me! To me, this is one of many places where you need to know the best items to order, in terms of value, what to put on the items, etc. as an example:  On a recent trip, I got the Pick 2, with the gumbo and the nachos. They were both stacked so high they were hard to carry steadily to the table, and my dining companion and I SHARED this for $7.50 and were both full! However, I saw another diner who ordered the Pick 2 with soup, and had maybe a 1/2 cup serving of soup.  Anyway, the main thing I need to say here is TRY THE GUMBO. It is so amazing, and is mainly what keeps me craving qdoba. The pork and the shredded beef are both fantastic options. I love corn salsa, so I'm always happy to see that. Their guacamole is very good quality too."}
{"text":"If you choose Qdoba over Chipotle, clearly you are not in the right frame of mind. The food is palatable, but the preparation can be a hit or miss. The burritos are prepared in a hurried way by indifferent employees. I asked the head employee once(might have been the manager) to drain the beans, and I was told he couldn't do that as he did not have time. The lackadaisical attitude of employees is not welcoming to say the very least. And this judgement is not a hurried one, but rather is the result of repeated 'unintended' friday night walk-ins.    The ambiance and niceties set aside, the food itself is average with no inviting characteristics. The rice and beans lack a zing, and salsa's don't help fix that. The flour tortillas aren't any better either. It's maybe due to poor quality of raw ingredients.     The ever empty tables on the 2nd floor are no irony. Even for being in the middle of cornfields, Champaign has numerous other places offering far better food."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I stopped in for lunch today. I had been here once before maybe six years ago. I ordered the pulled pork quesadilla. The girl behind the counter prepped it and put on the grill and when the time was up to pull it off, the tortilla got stuck, I could already see it was partially well done and falling apart, she really had to scrape to get it off the grill. My advise: PAM cooking spray.  I thought she was going to suggest to remake or offer a discount. I paid for my meal and sat down to eat. It was so soggy I could not pick it up, I had to use a fork. I can understand that maybe the pork was so juicy thus creating the well done soggy tortilla. The pork was good, but the tortilla part was so mushy and then the cheese just globbed. I pretty much just picked the pork. The guacamole was good.  I would suggest maybe for the pulled pork entrees, drain the juice, otherwise you just end up with a soggy mess.   Not the worst I have had and not the best. This would not keep me from coming back, next time I will just ask for the tortilla on the side or maybe some chips."}
{"text":"This Qdoba location is a quieter, shorter wait, alternative to the Chipotle located on the NW corner of Tatum & Cactus. I know some diners are passionate in their love for Chipotle, but Qdoba mimics the concept very well. Both chains originated in Colorado in the mid 1990's, which no doubt accounts for their similarity.   When the lines are out the door at Chipotle, come on over to the SE corner of Tatum & Cactus. The food at Qdoba is solid and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"-one burrito, and a quesadilla were $16 -ingredients were low quality, bland -the dining area wasn't clean  Qdoba is a not as good version of Chipotle. I would rather contract a neurovirus than eat at Qdoba again. The employees were really nice though.."}
{"text":"Cannot accept Mexican food. I love Asian cuisine only."}
{"text":"Qdoba is a chain of burrito/taco restaurants in Arizona.   They offer a savings card that allows you to earn points towards free food.   Tuesdays are the best day to go as it is double punch day on the card.    The Mesa location has been open for a few months and I have to say the staff is very friendly and a few times the girls behind the counters have had me laughing.   I find that always important when I go out to grab a quick bite.  My favorite items there are their lime chips and their chicken quesadillas.  I like the fact they are not afraid to pile on the cheese.  I really like their chicken it's always tender and this is one of the few places where I like their quacamole."}
{"text":"I love Qdoba.  I don't eat here enough.  None close to my house.  I used to work next to this location and the staff is better than most restaurants like this.  My favorite thing at Qdoba?  Nachos.  Pork Nachos, Steak Nachos, any nachos as long as they're smothered in Queso sauce!  MMMMM!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Great selection, great staff, good prices and close to home. Additionally, this place is very clean and fitting for the complex. I recommend gumbo if you haven't been here before."}
{"text":"Meh. If I have to choose between Chipotle and Qdoba, I would choose the former. Both places have ample seating area but when it comes to the taste, Chipotle is far more superior. Do yourself a favor and get something better."}
{"text":"Very friendly!  Quick food that is similar to Chipotle but with more traditional dining experience.  Serving portions were big and you get a good value for the money.  Good go to place if you want something quick and filling."}
{"text":"This is going to be brutal.  Hide the children.  If you've been to Chipotle, you'll feel right at home at Qdoba. That is, until you start eating. Complete and utter ripoff of the concept, except for the part that matters - the execution.  Where Chipotle succeeds, Qdoba fails miserably.  The ingredients are orders of magnitude shittier.  The burritos are just plain bad..  My burrito was loaded with rice and beans and very little meat - basically the opposite of what you'll get at the \"other\" place.  On top of that, the rice and beans were the suck.  And if you know Brak, you know that he LOVES his beans.  But not these.  About all they're good for is a massive bean fart shortly after ingesting this crap.  If you want to know the root cause of this debacle, check out who the parent company is - it's Jack In The Crack®.  Pretty much explains it all.  Avoid at all costs.  Receives Brak's dreaded zero-star review, rounded up to 1 because Yelp doesn't allow a zero."}
{"text":"Do to a very busy schedule I eat out a lot and I usually end up at this qdoba at least once a week. The place is always clean the food is always delicious and full of flavor. The staff is always so friendly and actually makes conversation with you."}
{"text":"It has been a good year or two since I have eaten here last and I'm not sure why. Today reinforced how much I like this place. To me, Qdoba falls into the Chipotle category although I feel the portions are definitely more generous than Chipotle. I like to get the Naked Chicken Burrito which is essentially a burrito with no tortilla. So, basically the Chipotle burrito bowl. It is just under $6 and enough for two meals. I'll instantly halve it when I get home to prevent me from overeating. It is very good. Their guacamole is very good, too. They also have a pick 2 combo for $6 and gives you smaller portions of your choice of the naked burrito, mexican soup, tacos, cheese quesadilla, etc. The other thing I like about this place is the rewards program and also how nice the employees always are. Like I said, it has been a long time since I have been back and I always comment on how friendly the employees are. Good sign."}
{"text":"We came here because my daughter requested it for her birthday.  We arrived at the start of the dinner rush, about 5pm.  It was empty and the dining hall was dirty.  The restaurant is almost exactly like Chipotle except that it is more expensive, the servings are smaller, and the food doesn't taste nearly as good."}
{"text":"If you want to try some of their menu items made with their melted queso, this might be a good place to visit. I didn't try any of those bc I try to avoid dairy.  But if you are just going to try something on their menu that is similar to the Chipotle menu (like me) then just go to Chipotle! it's literally one block away and much better.  I tried the steak burrito bowl here.  I ordered it exactly like I order my Chipotle burrito bowls (white rice, black beans, corn salsa, pico, red salsa) and it was alright, but not as good as Chipotle. for one, the black beans weren't cooked the entire way through and were kind of hard and raw at parts. the red salsa was also weird in that it tasted sort of like spaghetti sauce? literally the moment I had my first bite, I thought to myself - this reminds me of spaghetti. everything else from the corn salsa to the rice just wasn't as good as I could have had at Chipotle. for $1-2 more, Chipotle is worth it."}
{"text":"I come here often.  I get either the nachos or the queso burrito (I love their 3-cheese queso, it's amazing).  But usually the nachos, since you can't get those at other burrito places like Chipotle.  Sometimes the staff here need some help, but the food is always good."}
{"text":"I tried Qdoba again after some time off because I had several not so great visits in a row. Again, completely disappointed in this restaurant. Their portion sizes seem smaller than before and combined with the increase in price, no longer feels like a decent value.  I ordered the Pick 2 with the gumbo and 2 tacos with chips and a drink. My food was barely at room temperature and the chips were stale. The service was also pretty cold and not welcoming at all. $13.42 for less than par, small portions of food? No thanks.   Considering the fact that it wouldn't take much more effort, I think I'll eat at Chipotle where I've never had any problems and stop giving Qdoba my business."}
{"text":"I love Qdoba!  I think it's much better than Chipotle.  The staff has always been very nice.  Lots of options to change my order but I frequent this joint more than once a week."}
{"text":"was there 9/27/2014 in evening.  Place was dirty, I should have known better from the start.  Ordered a BBQ Burrito and my GF ordered Beef Wrapped Burrito.   The workers acted as if they couldnt wait to go home, just could care less.  the food looked bad, originally was going for steak but was so dried out it should have been thrown away.  Make a long story short two days later and we both do not feel good.  we have been fighting over the bathroom since we ate there. that bad honestly. probably the worst I have had in few years, needless to say I will never go back to that one, or any of them."}
{"text":"This Chipotle-wannabe place isn't so great.  Similar setup with the line and selecting your ingredients, and equally stupid pricing scheme wherein a bean & cheese burrito can be made, but if it has even a teaspoon of salsa also then it's a veggie burrito instead (pay up, buddy, for that teaspoon of salsa).  Staff was a bit grumpy and terse on my Saturday night visit, especially the older overweight lady who seemed to be the manager.    Salsa portion that comes with the chips & salsa order was pathetically small.  Food was decent.  But... there's Chipotle about a block away, so why mess with Qdoba?"}
{"text":"We decided on Qdoba for lunch, and I don't really know what I was expecting, but this is definitely average Mexican meets the cafeteria line. Every item, from start to finish, was scooped and plopped into a dish. Let's just say that if I want Mexican again, we're going back to Mad Mex."}
{"text":"This place is okay.  If I am going to consume a days worth of calories in one meal, however, this is not my first choice of venues.  Go to Carolina's instead.  Trust me."}
{"text":"While I love Qdoba for its tasty and inspired food, this location isn't exactly my favorite. It's more expensive than Taco Bell and similar price to Chipotle. In other locations around the state, the food is a bit above other chains but this spot seems to be a bit inconsistent, loud, and cramped."}
