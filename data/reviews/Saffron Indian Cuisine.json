{"text":"One of the worst lunch buffets I ever had. We were there on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't worth the money."}
{"text":"I eat there for lunch every other week (read... buffet) and have come to the conclusion that they are in a downward spiral.  The cost of the buffet is not cheap and the place is becoming less and less impressive.  

The food is fine but the little things are becoming more apparent.  The entrees are getting to be more saucey than they were in the past (e.g. the meat and vegetables in the dishes are being reduced).  Entrees that should be thick and dense are much more watery.  

More important, the buffet selections have been reduced to basic dishes that are repeated daily.  There was a time when one could find new and unique dishes nearly every day.

In short I suspect that the economy is taking it toll on this one."}
{"text":"Great place to get authentic Indian food. Really enjoyed the lunch buffet for the second time. Wait staff is real friendly and talk to you about the food."}
{"text":"Food is not so good , place is neat. There are some good dish though. I went on the pongal. There was sweet pongal on the menu- thoughtful . Papdi chat is good. Mango lasso was sour . The variety was not so gr8. Will not come again probably"}
{"text":"This Place is a total ripoff. I had placed an order for a Tandoori platter (mixed tandoori dishes) for close to 25$. The quantity was barely anything for the price. For the amount charged, a substantial quantity of food is expected. But the food served was scarce & was marginally anything there. If this is the portion served, the price should really be half. It is a  total waste of money to get food from this place. Will definitely NOT recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Saffron is the first Indian restaurant I have been in Charlotte after moving from LA. I really like this place because the food is really good and I really liked the way people treated me. Buffet is good with a lot of dishes but you have to try the Maharaja dinner. It is awesome, you get a lot of stuff to eat and the Malai Kabob that you get with it is so yummy. But if you are looking for south indian dishes, then this isn't the right place. Most of the dishes are North indian. And of course you get one of the most Delicious desert here, my fav. mango kulfi."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner. The service was good. We ordered Tandoori Roti and Matar Paneer and it came with free rice serving. The panner tasted really good and fresh. The ambiance was great and so was the price. Great place. Highly recommended for people who love Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"The food here is authentic and of the highest quality. If you like bread you must try Naan (stuffed with cheese or garlic/herbs or plain). It goes well with any dish.
The ONLY reason I deducted a star is somewhat sterile atmosphere. Music is there the smells are there but it is just not enough making me forget that I am in Charlotte, NC. More authenticity please!! 
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. The best Indian food on this side of the city!"}
{"text":"Terrible food ever ! I myself an Asian and love to have indian food all the time, I checked out online and saffron indian restaurant came out, saw some reviews and decided to get some food. 
Well let me describe 1st
I ordered one chicken biryani, one garlic naan and  one hot and sour chicken curry with plain rice. I normally don't notice the food when im super hungry, but today I didn't get any chance to say the food was good. 1st the garlic naan was so hard and thick.probably the cook was new or food was frozen, same was the biryani(fried rice with some pices chicken),
And the HoT and sour chicken curry was SWEET. I never had that sweet curry before. Nothing was fresh at all.  wondering why  people are writing something good about it, very expensive comparing their food quality.Totally worthless !!!!!"}
{"text":"Charlotte police investigated today when an explosion ripped through the Saffron Indian Restaurant shortly after their buffet line closed.  Several windows were blown out and Indian food was scattered over a large area in the parking lots. No one appeared to have been injured although one woman reported that her husband had suddenly disappeared and has not yet returned. She said she thought perhaps he had gone back through the line again for one MORE helping but then there was this huge \"Puff\" and everything \"turned a kind of a saffron-like color for a moment\".  

Hmmmmm . . . let me try again.


Eating the lunch buffet at the Safron is like listening to one of the world's great musical masterpieces while you are slowly strolling through a magnificent museum of art. Cascading tones of taste blend with contrasting elements of sour and sweetness, textures of pan and marsala and korma waft through the canvas and melodies of chicken and peas and mushrooms and lentils and rice and potatoes, all of which are saturated in the deep rich fullness of the melted flavors of spices and gravies that bring memories and dreams of glory to life, and each new bite is more than just an elevation of spirit, it is also a preparation and initiation for the next bite. Well - you will simply HAVE to go there and enjoy new thrills of great food. For more information check here: http://www.saffron-cuisine.com/"}
{"text":"After 3 visits, this has become my favorite Indian buffet!!! I never eat alone, but today I craved this place so much, I made an exception. 

The chicken tikka masala is perfect for those of us who love Indian but can't handle too much heat. The naan is delicious even if it is a little burnt.

Totally deserving of 5 HUGE stars!"}
{"text":"Drove thirty minutes to try out the lunch buffet here on a Saturday. Well worth the drive!! There was only one lonely soul besides us enjoying the buffet, which gave us time to sift through what we did and didn't like. Let me tell you, I only found one thing I didn't like. The Thai curry chicken was unbelievable. I think I put the mint sauce on everything. The service was excellent, and the atmosphere was nice for a buffet. I highly recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent! The service was the best in town...We really appreciated the conversation, recommendations, and the attentive service. We got the saffron chef special for two...best choice ever. Maharaja dinner lamb curry. And chk tikka Masala and mango cheese cake. Vinay was the best!  We will be back for the buffet!"}
{"text":"Went in for a quick lunch buffet at 2:10 and the greeter looked surprised that my friend and I had come in. I told him I would like to grab something off of the buffet and he said they close at 2:30. After looking over the buffet that still had plenty of food and patrons still sitting,talking,and eating, I told him I would like the buffet.  He repeats that they close at 2:30,with an attitude. I decided to leave. When I called to complain about his customer service,the manager's excuse was that some people come in and take too long so that is why he acted like that. I told her I have worked in a restaurant and if we close at 11, and someone comes in at 10:59,we seat them and wait on them just as we would anyone else because our establishment is still open until 11. You are not rude to them hoping they leave so that you can close. What makes it so bad is that it is a buffet so it is not like they had to cook the food,it was already laid out. I will not return,and will encourage my associates to do the same. Customer service was very disappointing."}
{"text":"We love Indian food and feared we would not find a good indian place on our trip down south.  Our friend decided on a whim to take us here.  Boy, were we satisfied! Friendly staff, beautiful decor, and excellent food.  The lamb was tenderly cooked, unlike a lot of other restaurants I've been to where it's overcooked.  As well, the portions were ample, particularly the raita.  Where I come from (Boston), we're used to paying 2.95 for a tablespoon of raita--this was one large bowl for 2.95.  Needless to say, we went home with leftovers.  The onion bhaji were to die for--again, they compared quite favorably to those I've had in the Northeast.  Great selection on the menu and attentive waitstaff.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We went for a Saturday afternoon lunch buffet, on a rainy day. Besides one table the place seemed deserted. The host seated us right away. We sampled only the vegetarian dishes and came out very disappointed. The pav bhaji was cold, so were the aloo chops which also seemed tasteless. There were three vegetable selections - Mushroom Mutter, Palak Paneer and a Cabbage based dish. The vegetable dishes seemed tasty but were not warm. It was as though the heating was switched off because there were no customers. The saving grace was the naan, which was warm and well done. I would probably come here again on a better summer day and hopefully the fare would me much more fresh and warm. For under $10 per head, I guess this was good."}
{"text":"Outstanding Indian cuisine! Vinay tended to us with exceptional service! The samosa apppetizers are delicious and the vegetarian entrees are a great choice. We ordered the dinner for 2 which included a delicious mango mousse for dessert. One of Charlotte's best restaurants!"}
{"text":"I love saffron. Food is very good, friendly staff, and the prices aren't terrible. I've been coming here for years an the owners know me by name and always greet me with a smile. I like coming for the buffet and trying different dishes. If you enjoy indian food I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Saffron is the best Indian cuisine we enjoy when in the Charlotte, NC area. Delicious, fresh... and hot lunch buffet will blow your Bombay mind! It is busy in here. Staff is courteous and quick to respond. No wonder it is a top rated Indian restaurant. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"We ordered carry out from this place and it only took about 20 minutes. The saffron chicken tikka masala and korma chicken were delicious. I asked for medium heat and it was still quite a bit spicy so I recommend mild if you don't like your food too hot. The spinach and cheese stuffed naan was excellent and one order is definitely enough for 2 people."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian restaurant in Charlotte. :) And they have the world's best mango cheesecake."}
{"text":"Saffron is on my go-to list for date night.  The food is and service is always terrific.  They have a full bar and good wine at a reasonable price.  If you are looking for a great meal before a movie It's the best table anywhere near Ayrsley in my opinion."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Been to both the lunch buffet and to dinner -- great food at both times, but the lunch buffet is the better monetary deal.  However, the ambiance at dinner is more romantic."}
{"text":"I go to Saffron every few months. Its pretty good Indian. 

Apps: Skip the samosa and go for the pakoora or bhaji. The samosas are a bit doughy. The filling is tasty though. 

Mains: Chicken Tikka = tasty and not to be confused with Chicken Tikka Masala (what most people think of when they say Chicken Tikka). 
The Tikka Masala is also very good. The flavors are well balanced and I have had it both spicy and mild. Both are good and just a matter of personal tastes at the moment. 
Lamb Saag is good. Who can go wrong with spinach and lamb??? 
Ive had the mushrooms in spinach and they are full of flavor too. 
Tandoori-- ahh the mainstay of any Indain joint. Theirs is well spiced and not over cooked. 

Rice and Naan: The rice is spiked with bits of spices and very fragrant. The naan is soft and crisp at the same time. Try the garlic naan. 

Rice pudding: Oh yea baby. Cardamum, rice and cream/milk. Simple and deceptively good even if you thought like I did that Indian rice pudding is really runny. Then I tasted it and realized its supposed to be like that. I'll take one now and one to go. It is really easy to make at home too. 

My only complaint is that naan is sold a la cart. If you tend to go through it like I do (and most of the Indian population as well) it gets a bit pricey."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and needed to find our new favorite Indian cuisine restaurant. Well our search is done. We tried the lamb rogan josh, palek paneer, fish curry. We also had the onion Bahaar as an appetizer which is our new favorite starter! The rice pudding was also delicious! Vinay was so helpful, kind, and made great suggestions! We will definitely be back to enjoy the fantastic food and customer service."}
{"text":"Ok buffet... No lamb... Only chicken.. That too tasted ordinary... They have sprayed kala jeera on all items I guess... I disliked the taste of some of the chicken dishes because of this.... Also they served naan without butter chicken... Less variety.. Overall a mediocre experience..."}
{"text":"This is my first review ever. But I have to write this. Went there for dinner. Found hard stone like black stuff in dal makhani. I had ordered daal for my kid. When I called the lady at the counter and told her, instead of saying sorry, she says thanks for letting her know and went straight into the kitchen with that stone. Service was pathetic, they won't come to the table after serving to check if we need water or other stuff. Never going back again."}
{"text":"This was an awesome experience the food was amazing. The staff really made the experience one of our party had never had Indian cuisine before and he made her feel right at home."}
{"text":"Amazing tastes and authentic flavors. The staff are friendly and engaging, overall an excellent experience."}
{"text":"Authentic Flavors at ok prices.  I have no complaints here.  Perfect location for a great meal and movie afterwards.  My only complaint about this place is that sometimes it may take a while for the staff to bring you your check....important if you are going to the movie afterwards and want to get there on time, LOL."}
{"text":"Me encanta este restaurante tiene mucha variedad y excelentes precios ,tienen un bufett con todos los Plato's representatives,la comida es muy buena."}
{"text":"Great Indian food option with a very friendly staff!

The lunch buffet is very affordable with lots of options and the dinner menu is full of even more flavorful dishes."}
{"text":"All I can say the place was clean and comfortable we went for dinner ordered drinks and several dishes to split all the food was awesome . Knocked off a star because  never saw waiter again after we ordered too see of we needed more drinks . But a very nice lady maybe owner did come by and see if everything was ok . This place is a big yes to go to . Food arrived in a timely manor and was very good"}
{"text":"We found this place while looking for another restaurant and thought it would be great to give it a try. It was during the lunch buffet and since I'm a vegetarian,  I thought to myself that you can never go wrong with Indian food. Since we've been to 2 others in the area (Spice South Indian Cuisine which is now Peacock Indian Cuisine and still amazing, and the other place being Jaipur) we thought this place would be a nice spur of the moment change.  First off the vegetarian options were very slim with only about 4 options versus the many chicken dishes. I got some of the vegetable biryani and naan and my husband got the other vegetarian dishes that I didn't get. I took one bite of the naan and the biryani and was instantly done! The flavor was non-existent and the rice was dry. I tasted the dishes that my husband got and they tasted like baby food and like they had come from a can and cooked in the microwave. I am not Indian, nor do I consider myself an expert on the subject of Indian cuisine, but, Indian food is my favorite kinds of cuisine and I've eaten and cooked enough of it to know that this was NOT good Indian food. Anytime I can cook your food better than you and I'm not \"you\" there's a problem. The food was elementary at best. We spent less than 5 minutes in this place, and even though I didn't feel like I should have to pay a rusty nickel for such a rudimentary execution of a meal, I did ($25 + a $5 tip for NOTHING) simply because I was already so disappointed and just wanted the experience to be over. Anyone that knows me, knows that nothing messes up my day more than bad food. If you think this is good Indian food, you are cheating yourself because you have obvoiusly not eaten GOOD Indian food(because there is a difference). And this place should certainly not be called \"Fine\" anything. I'm only giving it one star because I can't rate it any lower."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, but portions were small at there price and they wouldn't give a refil of nan (pita bread) and that's a first.... Lunch buffet is the only way to go. IMHO."}
{"text":"I was blown away with how delicious the food was. It's been a while since I've had authentic indian food like that. The lady up front was very knowledgeable and kind. I wanted to try something new, and she gave me unique recommendations. Saffron has really raises my standards for Indian food!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. The food is cooked to order for spice. All dishes--vegetarian, chicken, meat--are worth trying and quite tasty. Good place for dinner for two or entertaining friends and family."}
{"text":"I've eaten Indian food all over the world and this place rocks!  I compare this to curry places in the UK, China, San Fran, and Ithaca...very authentic cuisine.  They are very consistent on their spice level based on what you tell them.  They offer superb service and a well crafted menu.  

Being a huge fan of Indian food I have found most do not live up to my expectations but this one nails it!

They only negative is I wish they had a better wine and beer menu...but I don't mind saving a few bucks by not drinking."}
{"text":"Never, ever disappoints. Another great dinner at Saffron. Here for a little birthday dinner - servers are attentive, food is great. Chicken korma is the best."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the lunch buffet. There is a nice selection of food i can not pronounce or spell. The food has great flavor.  I tried to get pictures but they did not like that so something curry. Lunch parking is terrible and dinner time is not much better. Plan on the parking deck and walking.  Prices at lunch are fine but high at dinner compared to the portion size."}
{"text":"The attitude of staff is really rude. They charge you $13 for sunday buffet and 9$ for weekdays. On asking why such a huge difference I was told it because of one tasteless and very poorly made mutton/lamb item on the menu. There sanitation rating is way below 94 and you can see how shabby and unhygienic their counters and service areas are.

If you dont mind falling sick or love the stomach aches, you will love the food.
Best of luck!

Never ever returning there."}
{"text":"Best Buffet at lunch. Eat there at least once a week."}
{"text":"Excellent food especially the garlic name bread. Good service, we ordered the bharta bruchetta appetizer which was good and they didn't bring out our entrées until we had finished the appetizer. I can't remember the entrées we ordered, nor could I spell them if I remembered, but they were both delicious and just the right spiciness level for what we thought we were ordering. 

I will be coming back for another dinner."}
{"text":"Saffron is my favorite Indian restaurant in Charlotte. Some of the negative reviews listed involve the lunch buffet which I have not had. Had dinner there last night and loved it. The service is very good and just can't fault the food. 

Here's my summary: 

Cleanliness: Good 
Food: Excellent
Service: Good

Parking is a little challenging, but located a spot around the corner. No bigs. I'm very particular about service and food...thumbs up from me with 5 stars."}
{"text":"Happened upon Saffron and was really impressed! 
The appetizer sampler and chutneys were spicy and delicious, the service was excellent, and  it was a perfect meal from start to finish.
I had a spicy chicken biryani and my date chose  channa masala (vegan), and we were both raving. Finished up with a warm dessert that was like donut balls in a honey syrup.
Neither of us live in Charlotte, but if we did, we'd be regulars. Wonderful dining experience!"}
{"text":"I used to be a huge fan of Saffron. However, they are obviously cutting corners on authenticity to save money. The lunch buffet is very watered down and disappointing. Dinner is better, but the people that work there almost seem annoyed by you and seem to just want to make money in the cheapest way possible. Sorry for the bad review, but there are much better Indian places to eat in Charlotte. P.S. don't drink the water... not even lime or lemon can help what is coming out of Saffron's faucets."}
{"text":"Dinner: had Dosa and Baigan bartha. It was good. 
Lunch buffet: was also good."}
{"text":"The food is fine. The only thing I wanted to point out is the behavior of the lady at the counter. She seems to be the owner (or the co-owner) and that seems to be getting to her head. My wife just wanted to switch to another table during the lunch buffet but one of the staff told us that all other tables are reserved (which is quite un-usual for a buffet, i mean it defeats the purpose of having a buffet). After 5 minutes, the lady at the counter came at our table and snapped as us - \"We don't have any other tables except this one\". I mean she should have been atleast sorry for not finding another table. Not sure if she was just having a bad day but that's not how you treat a customer. Thought of telling this to her face, but we have such experiences at previous visits as well and she doesn't seem to be apologetic at all. Let her off the door, the restaurant still got a chance."}
{"text":"Pathetic place, poor service and attitude of the owner. Definitely a place which one can give a miss"}
{"text":"I had dinner here and the food was good but the rice served with it was like birds food. When I asked for extra rice they charged us around $4 which was disappointing.  Little things like these matter to me so this place is out of my list."}
{"text":"Best Indian lunch buffet in town.  The owners couldn't be more nice and the quality is extremely consistent.  I highly recommend this to those who enjoy Indian food!"}
{"text":"Our family recently ate dinner at Saffron and we were very pleased. 

I am no expert on Indian cuisine, but hubby is quite well versed and he found the food to be spot on.  I enjoyed everything we ordered.  Very, very tasty.  Prices are a little steep for the portion size though.

We received good service.  I did, however, notice several tables around us seemed to be having issues with service (not coming to the table quickly enough, issues with checks, etc.).  I felt lucky that we had no glitches."}
{"text":"Good day, 
I've eaten from you buffet, I must say the logistics of the food placement is very confusing. Either switch around the hot and cold food or label \"the line starts here\". Excellent taste."}
{"text":"I've loved everything about this place. The food, service, and atmosphere. My favorite would definitely be the tandoori chicken, it was so juicy and delicious...the best I've ever had at any Indian restaurant. Another one of my favorites was the kabuli naan, it was so fresh."}
{"text":"Decent food, Unpleasant manager

I happened to visit this place after gym (ymca) and forgot to get my purse. I asked if I could pay with my phone but the manager was not even willing to listen. They said I don't know what you are doing and will not let you do. I understand that if it din't work that is a different story, but you need to atleast listen and trust your customer. Finally bought my card and paid. 

Anyways the food wasn't great too. It has a place outside to sit that is good."}
{"text":"We checked out Saffron because we had a restaurant.com certificate & I'm always up for finding a new Indian restaurant to try. 

I was more put off by the service than the food. I asked for my food Indian hot & the waiter didn't believe I could handle the spiciness & made me eat their onion chutney in front of him to see how I'd react before he'd allow me to order.  Totally obnoxious.  In the end, my food came out mild anyways & it wasn't all that great.  

I gave it a try, but the rude waiter & the boring food made my decision to never return.  I'll stick to Maharani, they don't question my desire for Indian hot curry!"}
{"text":"Great food awesome service. Will be going back often. 
Always nice when a server recommends food based on what you like."}
{"text":"Excellent food, nice portions, friendly professional servers, prices that are just about right. Located in a wonderfully fresh community about 2 miles from Carowinds."}
{"text":"I've come here once w my family and twice w my company. The food is ok- edible but definitely catered to Americans. Not much flavor or spice. Place is clean though and in a good location. If I were footing the bill I'd be headed for some of 
the better Indian restaurants in charlotte."}
{"text":"I ordered Malai kofta. I got fried Paneer kheema rolls in gravy. I was expecting standard kofta receipe which has vegetable and cheese rolls. When I asked about it to owner he said as per their definition Paneer = indian cheese....Wtf...I wasted my money....And this place is super costly..One person meal take min 20 bucks...Just one veg and nan"}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet. Nice variety, excellent flavor, efficient staff with understated Indian music in the background at a level that encourages conversation. So much better than the standard bar food in the area!"}
{"text":"Amazing lunch buffet and wonderful staff! I didn't have a thing I didn't like.  Not anywhere near our house but we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I could have given a zero or negative but not allowed here. Went there several time just hoping it will be better next time. No luck, food was always bad in taste and quality. No variety in buffet and whatever they had went out of stock soon. Worst experience!"}
{"text":"I love this place more (almost) every time I come!
Saffron is our stand-by local Indian restaurant when we have the craving but it would be worth the drive even if it were farther. We bring any out of town guests here for a great quiet dinner and the staff are strikingly respectful. I know that's an odd thing to say and it's sad that respect stands out as so odd that it merits mention. The lights are perfect, the menu seems to have been recently updated (try the papabi chat!!)

Saffron is great for a quiet dinner, an intimate chat, a delicious lunch buffet, an affordable semi-fancy date (because the ambiance is perfect and staff is wonderful) or just about any other small group.

Saffron is bad for a large group though because they add a large tip to the bill for you. I typically tip 20+ percent but I like the option to half it for terrible service. The service has always been excellent here but I want the option. I never tip extra when insulted with an 'auto-tip.' It's also bad if you like rice because they charge for extra rice!

On spiciness - I usually get a 7 and it tastes medium spicy. But there's a big difference going to 8 and you'll remember the meal the next day. I can eat Dave's Scorpion sauce straight and and the 8+ here is on par with that. It's tasty and still edible but wow, sweat by the end of the meal.
Saffron is awesome. It's on my top 5 most visited restaurants in Charlotte for sure."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Saffron and I was impressed! 

My friend and I arrived a little after noon and the place wasn't crowded, we were seated immediately and our server was kind and attentive. 

The buffet offers a great variety of options! My favorites were the samosas, lamb meatballs and chicken tiki marsala....and let's not forget the yummy naan bread! The food was really good! Since I'm new to enjoying Indian food I liked being able to sample many different options and not being stuck with something I didn't like. Lucky for me everything here was great. 

I'm sure to be back again!"}
{"text":"I met four friends tonight at Saffron, we ordered lots of food and ate family style, it was fine, I wasn't in love, but I certainly didn't hate it.

At the end of our meal, my friend went to pay, we were going to separate the check evenly three ways, since we used a Citypass coupon, saving a whopping $12 off of our $130 check, we could only use one credit card. I would have told them to take the coupon off and use the credit cards, but my friend had already paid the total.  Suck it Saffron."}
{"text":"3.5 for the food - solid, satisfying, very good sauces. I ordered pakoda and a lamb dish, and enjoyed it. Better was the service - I ordered through Yelp / Eat24, but after an hour, hadn't received anything. Meanwhile, EAT24 was being unresponsive, and Yelp's website was experiencing an outage. I called into the phone number listed on the Yelp page, and was directed to call the right restaurant; apparently the number listed was wrong. A few minutes after we hung up, I got a call back from that number. The gentleman on the other end, whom I had just spoken to, wanted to let me know that he had tracked down my order at the restaurant, and that it was being prepared and would be sent over shortly. A nice thing to do. I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"Delicious food!!! The tiki Marsala is to die for and the staff is very kind. Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My sister and I had the lunch buffet today.  The price was reasonable and the food was really good!  I wish they'd had more of a variety on the buffet (maybe some lamb?) but what they did have was quite tasty.  Will definitely be back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Service is very biased. Food is better at other nearby restaurants such as the blue taj, woodlands, Jaipur.  Not much to offer unless they improve their attitudes."}
{"text":"My crappy photos are nothing compared to what we experienced. I absolutely enjoyed myself and will definitely be coming back. My boyfriend and I just got off work and was craving Indian for dinner. This place was the closest to us so we decided to try it. Must I say, when we walked in they were very welcoming and you know it's authentic when locals are in there. We sat down and was provided chips and three various types of sauce from mild to spicy, which was very good! I ordered their Indian Chai tea and I will never look at tea the same again. This creamy milky aroma flavored tea was everything! I have never felt so uplifted with tea before lol. They have a wide menu selection from vegetarian to non-vegetarian. We got an appetizer, and I apologize because I forget the name but it was great! From then we knew the entrees were going to be phenomenal. We got the non-vegetarian for two dinner deal. It had chicken and lamb, enough for two with your choice of curry for each. We got chicken curry and paneer curry, AMAZING! It was creamy with great spices and we couldn't help but to keep dipping our naan in the curry. After that, they brought out dessert which was similar to Arroz de leche, great flavor and such a calming dessert after a spicy meal. We also asked the owner what was in their tea and dessert because it had such a specific taste and aroma to it. Found out, it was cardamom which is common within Indian tea (something new I learned). Overall, their service was excellent and very attentive. They have decent prices for the portion of food you get, quit being fatties people. The decor seems elegant yet settled. The bathrooms were clean and a bonus for good toilet paper. I highly recommend and if you had a bad experience, maybe it wasn't them but you. This may be our regular to go to Indian restaurant for now on. Thank you all so much for your service!"}
{"text":"i tried the lunch buffet - not authentic indian food, horrible quality, some items were cold and this was at 11am, not recommended"}
{"text":"We moved here from the Bay Area 4 years ago and were unsure if we'd be able to get our staple Asian cuisines. Although we can't get Burmese, this place is a frequent destination as the owners are extremely kind, and honestly the best Chicken Tikka Masala we've had anywhere in the US (at least from what we've compared in LA, SF, San Jose, Seattle, New York, and DC)

We typically get Samosas, garlic naan, and a Chicken Saag with our two orders of tikka masala. Always consistent, and always amazing."}
{"text":"Saffron is a perfectly fine Indian restaurant and would have gotten 4 stars from me, but a service hiccup near the end of our meal deserves some recognition.

As many have mentioned, the lunch buffet is a good deal. They offer more selections that it appears when you first arrive in the restaurant, and for the price, you really have the chance to try some pretty good Indian food. I also ordered a couple of things off of the menu -- everything was tasty, and the staff nicely ensured that the spiciness of the food matched my preference. The restaurant itself isn't the fanciest, but it's clean, neat, and provides a fine atmosphere for lunch (which is when I would recommend going).

The hiccup for which they lost a star came (as many hiccups do) with the bill. I had purchased the Living Social deal and had informed the first server of this when he came to our table for drink orders. Part-way through our meal, however, a different server began coming to our table, and she was apparently not informed of our coupon. When she brought the bill, we reminded her, she said something snotty like, \"You're supposed to tell us when you come in, and no one ever does.\" I tried to explain that I had, but she cut me off, sighing, and walked away. The coupon was ultimately applied (it seemed like an easy fix not warranting her reaction, I might add), but I didn't appreciate being spoken to in that way and then not even allowed to explain that I wasn't at fault.

In sum, it's a good lunch buffet, but nothing wonderful. Maybe I'll just stick with Copper."}
{"text":"Very very good, from a Punjabi reviewer.

Went early on a Friday night... no wait. The food was fantastic with good flavor. We had the TIkka Masala and Chhola. Father had the Tandoori Chicken which was okay.

I wasn't a fan of the paper tablecloths, and the waiter did push the alcohol/wine list too much. Not the typical warm, mom-and-pop feel to the place, but overall, great food."}
{"text":"I have eaten a lot of Indian food in my life: in India, United Kingdom, and from Maine to South Florida. I think I am good at discerning the difference in quality presented by the many Indian restaurants in the USA.
Saffron gets a grade of A - outstanding.
The ambiance is pleasant inside (or diners may choose outside).  Service is friendly, helpful, attentive.
This evening we shared a bottle of the house Merlot ($22) and the Maharaja Dinner for two ($49.99). So, with tax and 22% tip, total bill only $94. 
The Maharaja Dinner starts with papadum and spices and then a chicken appetizer that was yummy. Then for entrées,  it includes a tandori sizzler of chicken and lamb with lots of onions and peppers, basmati rice, and nan/bread. For our optional entrées we chose Baingan Bharta  (eggplant) and Rogan Josh (lamb). We ordered everything medium spicy and it was just that. Food was simply delicious. When our orders arrived we thought \"no way can we eat all this\" but it was too good to eat in moderation. So, we violated the deadly sin of GLUTTONY.  Oh well, try to eat less tomorrow (not likely, on vacation now). And, the special dinner for two includes dessert. Gotta let out my belt a notch.
Bottom line is that Charlotte has a great Indian restaurant here for locals to enjoy regularly and visitors to check out while they're here."}
{"text":"I've been here several times. Great lunch buffet. Not always sure what I'm having, but everything is good. Have also been for dinner and had goat and lamb. Both were good."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I typically never give single star or 5 star so easily to any restaurant but Saffron really made it to my 1-star places. I was here for a business lunch and I am a professional cook in my other life so I \"know\" food. These guys seriously underestimate their \"American\" clientele and think whatever they will cook, we will eat...well, guess what, not with everyone..at least not with me.
1. Stale: They store food for days..I can clearly see that the food is not freshly cooked. Probably if you go here every day, you will find out same curries day by day. I think the health dept need to make a surprise visit here.
2. Service: really needs some big improvements..or shall I say, they choose who to serve and who not to. I think typically in Indian restaurants, the servers profiles you as soon as you enter into the door and they already decide what level of service they will give you.
3. Pricey: These guys are flat out costly, period. For the money they charge, you do not see the quality at all..

I hope owners of this restaurant read this and do something about it..In my opinion it is \"safe\" to avoid this one.

{"text":"Excellent food and wonderful service! Definitely try this place out. I needed suggestions from the menu and was not disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I love Indian food. But I seem to managed to order the same thing everything I come to Saffron. It's the Chicken Tikka Marsala, Aloo Goobi and of course the nann bread. I usually tell them to do it non spicy because I can't handle spicy food at all. And I love it. I love how every time I order the food it taste as good as the last time. Their services have gotten way better since my previous review. I also like their lunch buffet. If people are interested in trying Indian food. Their buffet is a good place to start."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant on Saturday.we have ordered vegetable Manchuria,kadai paneer and tandoori roti,vegetables Manchuria was good but they have given only 5 manchurian balls which we feel bit less quantity but the taste is too good.kadai paneer was also good but bit spicy for us we have ordered 6 on spice scale might be 5 is enough for us.for indians who want more spicy they can go for 6 on spice scale.overall the visit is good and lastly we liked the ambience very much."}
{"text":"So I came here for lunch with a friend the other day and I have to say I was sorely disappointed!! The buffet was sad!! Seriously they had a tikka masala that looked like a random watery chicken curry. In fact all of their options were watery!! I'm not sure what happened as the first time I came it was a solid 3 1/2 stars now the only thing making me give it 2 stars is it was cheap and the samosas with tamarind sauce was good. The waitstaff seems really off as well. They didn't seem to want to be there that day. All in all I highly doubt I will ever come back, I came out of convenience and well totally wasn't worth it!! Watery curry and unidentifiable selections are a clear sign to stay away!!!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe I have not already written a review for this restaurant. It's seriously one of my favorite places to eat. We frequent the lunch buffet at least once every few weeks, more if we can! I have been there at night and I think Saffron is a whole different place in the evening.

I consider everything they cook amazingly good, but their specialty, in my opinion, is the chicken tikka masala. It's usually on the buffet and I eat entirely too much of it every time I go. It's probably contributed to at least one dress size that I'm battling.

In addition to kick-ass food, the service is impeccable. You take a single drink and someone is right there to refill your glass. Plates are whisked away quietly while you're at the buffet loading up again.

Now, as a side note, which may or may not be important to you, the decor in the restaurant is truly lovely. At lunch you notice it and appreciate the delicate artwork and calm but spicy color scheme. But in the evening, this is a great place to take a date. With the colors and soft window dressings, this restaurant is elegant and understated, without being stuffy and expensive. The food is spicier at night, so be aware of that and order lots of lassi if you can't handle a little heat."}
{"text":"Indian food is by far one of my favorite things to eat, and Saffron didn't disappoint.

I an a friend shared some lamb dish and some chicken curry, and although I was a bit surprised that naan wasn't included in the meal (just rice), the portions were large and overall it was a good value.

Service was excellent, with a friendly (but not *too* friendly) waiter and affable staff.

We went during dinner, but at lunch they have a buffet which I'd like to try next time.

Highly recommended if you're in the neighborhood and like Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"One time we stopped by here after the movies to grab dinner, but they were having a private party and was only placing take out orders to go.

Came for dinner here. The food is just right for me. Not crazy about hot and spicy foods. My stomach is not able to handle that much heat.

We order an appetizer- the Potali Samosa. The crust is like a fried Cannoli. Really good with the dipping sauce- Mild which was sweet, Med- Green sauce and Hot-Red which I steer far away from.

Entrees consisted of Lamb Saag- Creamy spinach with lamb. Also, Lamb Vindaloo- Little tangy spice. They entrees were prepared mild and was just right.

Wash it all down with a glass of Pinot Grigio. What a nice way to end the evening. Great place to take a date on, celebrate anniversary or even a girls night out.

Will be back again."}
{"text":"Been to a lot of Indian restaurants and this one is by far the best in charlotte we've tasted! Catered to my meat eating husbands needs as well as myself who is vegetarian. The food is delicious and the waiter was extremely friendly and helpful, asking how spicy we liked our food. The manager/owner even came over to ask how we liked the food! The food is decently priced and the portions are filling! Will definitely be back soon..."}
{"text":"After deciding to not watch a movie on our night out from the kids, my wife and I walked down to Saffron from the theater.  I should have followed my first instincts: as we walked in the door, we asked to see a menu so we could decide if we, in fact, wanted to eat here.  The server manning the door kept insisting that we \"sit down\" while we peruse the menu.

After we did sit down, I realized I left the door to the car unlocked with valuables inside, and asked my wife to order my drink.  I walked to the theater, locked the car, and then back to the restaurant.  The drink order had still not been taken, even though there were only 3  tables (7 individuals), including us, in the whole place and 4 visible staff members.

Eventually, I ordered a medium-spicy dish and my wife a mild one.  Her dish, cauliflower and potatoes, was spicier than mine and otherwise rather tasteless.  My dish, chickpeas and potatoes, had no heat whatsoever and tasted like curry and filler.

After we ate, I asked for the drink menu.  After 10 minutes, no one had come back to take my drink order (there were SIX tables at this point), so we paid and left.

The restaurant was nicely apportioned, and very quiet when we arrived.  However, shortly thereafter a family arrived with a small child who had a penchant for screaming.  The poor manners of this family aside, the exposed ceiling of the restaurant caused the noise to redouble, and my wife and I stopped even trying to converse."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an exotic meal that will tantalize your taste bids, Saffron Indian cuisine will fulfill that desire.
Sporting dishes and flavors from the best locations of India, there are so many dishes to choose from. 

But similar to a hidden gem, the best dishes are not listed on the menu.  Ask your server from dishes that are not on the menu and you will be pleasantly surprised.

End the exquisite meal with a delightful authentic Indian Dessert with a cup of their chai tea and you will feel true satisfaction.

Excellent food with matching service."}
{"text":"Me and my brother ate here two weeks ago and it was so amazing!! My mother would always take us to authentic Indian restaurants growing up, the two of us haven't eaten Indian food in about 4 years. We decided to go here for dinner and seriously... It was so freaking delicious!!! The staff was very sweet, everything was made with love. I have been meaning to leave a great review for this delicious restaurant. We stuffed our faces with Naan and shared my Chicken Marsala and his lamb curry dish. I rarely ever eat lamb but the lamb they had was COOKED perfectly!! Great quality meat for sure. I recommended it to my best friend and she ate there two days after we did and also said it was AMAZING!! Thank you guys so much for such a wonderful night and wonderful dishes. We will be back!"}
{"text":"BEWARE Food is good, location is also nice but the owners don't let the waiters/waitresses keep their TIPS(neither cash nor credit card)!! Please share the word. I saw them once picking cash from table and giving it to the owner/manager. I have personally inquired from all the staff every now and then. I was super disappointed. There used to be a girl named kareshma and then now there's a guy, both told the same thing. It's a nice place but keeping the tips is just wrong."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this as it was my introduction to Indian Food.  The lunch buffet was great and let us try all the different varieties.  Thanks for the treat.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Good cuisine, nice atmosphere, good service. Parking is a hassle."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of time for the lunch buffet and for dinner. Always satisfying food and very friendly staff. Most recently I had Lamb Shank Curry as my entree. The aroma's of the spices/dishes contributes substantially to the flavor and all around experience of your meal. The prices are reasonable, and I will return,"}
{"text":"This place was really good! It was kind of quiet, which made a loud-ass obnoxious person like myself a little uncomfortable at first, but you adjust. The naan was always hot and good, the Kingfisher cold and crisp, and the Saffron Chicken Tikka Masala was incredibly good. I'm a relative novice when it comes to Indian food but this place hit the spot. I enjoyed that level of spice is super customized--we were literally asked choose our level from one to ten. Nominal spice ordering, cool! I'd love to come back and try some of the other things on their huge menu."}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet, best of all is how clean and delicious the food is. Oh not to mention their hospitality! 

I enjoy eating well and not feeling full of butter, sugar, and salt. Not to mention the potato balls are perfectly shaped and full of flavor.

Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and it has been alright, fell very rushed when eating as the staff grabbed plates before being finished.  I also got a drop of water as a refill and the waiter never returned."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and great food. I'd never tried shrimp Marsala but it was really good with naan. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Every time we come to Charlotte, we return to our favorite restaurant, \"Saffron\"!  The food is exquisite and the service is exemplary.  All the staff are excellent, but Vinay always makes the visit extra special.  We even get take-out for later to prolong the culinary delight.  A must-try dining experience."}
{"text":"A lesson I learnt - never have a drink at an Indian restaurant! Their drink menu is horrible. Appetizers were OK. Biryani was no where near to good. It was way too spicy for a 7/10 spice level. Who adds eggplant in a biryani!! Patoli samosas are the only worthy dish here."}
{"text":"For a Friday night date the place was a bit empty, a mixed crowd with families, to other dates, to a redneck in jean shorts. 

The food was all quite excellent with a great aroma hitting you right as you walk through the door. Getting some recommendations from the waiter was a bit awkward but you could tell they all knew their stuff. A lentil soup with a great presentation followed by some lamb dishes. You could adjust the spicy scale of the food so we cranked it up. 

Overall great food, in a location that did seem a bit odd, no reservation needed on around 7:30 on a Friday."}
{"text":"My friends introduced me to this amazing restaurant yesterday and I loved it so much I brought my husband back today!  He is an avid Indian food lover and said it was the best he's ever had. We were able to eat dinner and the buffet to experience many of the foods they offer. Nothing disappoints.... we will make this a regular spot for awesome food!"}
{"text":"Only reason am giving 2stars is because I ate there almost every day for two weeks because of necessity.  They served me food and am grateful for that. 
Otherwise, they serve the same food two or three days continuously.  They change the desserts once a week.  Will not go again!"}
{"text":"I love Indian food Pakistan food but this place just falls short! Been tons of time even though the buffet is so weak. Tandoori chicken is the best part but that lacks flavor. The \"vindaloo\" is not spicy and the only other meat is chicken something again no flavor. I moved here from Virginia and went to a place called cherry blossom and I wish saffron was more them them. Tons of meat choices full of flavor and spice. Hope you read this and change the buffet selection"}
{"text":"Saffron is nothing to write home about but it's perfectly fine. This review pertains to the lunch buffet specifically.

As buffets go, it has what you'd expect. There is certainly plenty of food and the service is very friendly. Pretty much all of the meats on the buffet as far as I can recall have been chicken, which doesn't really reflect the full array of Indian dishes.  However, this limitation is not surprising considering the lunch buffet is all you can eat and it's only $10 per person.

Would I list it as a \"great spot to brag about and bring friends to\"? No. Would I likely go there again for the buffet, due to its ability to appeal to a large group and its reasonable and predictable price? Yes."}
{"text":"I should preface this review by stating that I am not, generally speaking, a lover of buffets.  I usually find the food to be lukewarm and rubbery: that is, when I am not too disgusted by my fellow patrons' self-service habits to eat it.

Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoy Saffron.  The food is hot and frequently refreshed, the service is attentive and polite.  Best of all, at least in my opinion, is that the diners at Saffron are usually calm and restrained enough not to be thrusting their hands into trays or re-using plates in their frenetic efforts to feed themselves.  Lunchtime is just busy enough that you know the place is good, but slow enough that it's pleasant and quiet.

I wholeheartedly recommend the chicken tikka masala and the tomato soup, both of which are delicious.  Honestly though, everything at the small-but-thoughtful buffet is good.  If you are having one of those days that require a dessert, the rice pudding is tasty as well.

So let it be known that this buffet-hater has found a buffet he can enthusiastically endorse, even to his fellow buffet-haters."}
{"text":"Saffron was a pleasant surprise! Came here on a Tuesday at about 6:30 pm. The restaurant was pretty quiet when we arrived but it picked up during our meal. We sat on the patio, had tikka masala, garlic naan, samosas, mango chutney, etc. Everything was excellent, including service. Two different managers, who were both very polite, came by to check on our experience. I was quite impressed at how sharply dressed the servers were dressed... Having worked in service for some time I love a restaurant where the staff takes pride in appearance, as this is typically a good sign for attention to detail in other areas of the business (read:cleanliness). Didn't really see the interior decor but through the window it seemed somewhat generic. Would definitely pay another visit."}
{"text":"If you hate delicious tikka masala and fresh garlic naan then you are correct on not eating here. Because this is a great display of Indian food. If your nervous to venture out and try new things, opt for the buffet. It's a great way to sample a new food! Place is nicely decorated and immaculate! Owners are present when you get there to greet you. They also have a regular dinner menu great for date night!"}
{"text":"The smell of spices emanating from this place are enough to get you in the door. Food is amazing and Kumar and Vinay are highly efficient and knowledgeable of the menu items. Highly recommend you check them out."}
{"text":"Yummy & Delicious! Great vegetarian options, Everything very flavorful and fresh! I love their roti's! Environment great for a date ;-)"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food.  I must say I do agree with some of the earlier posts.  The staff is okay.  The worst thing is they added a 20% gratuity and then had the nerve to include a line for an additional tip when I paid with my credit card.  Not a fan of double dipping."}
{"text":"1st time visit. Got my order to go. I wanted to try a bit of everything but unfortunately the buffet is not available to-go. After quickly studying the menu, I went with the tandoori shrimp app and the shrimp marsala. The shrimp app was okay, the garlic flavor was here but still kinda bland. The marsala was awesome!!! The owners I assume were very friendly and the atmosphere was real laid back for lunch time. I will be back to test out that buffet."}
{"text":"Annoyed! 5/24 unable to get in some sort of party. Asked for to go food they said no....today i see on the door they have delivery??? 5/25 i come in there were only 3 customers ...imagine my shock when the waiter wanted me to sit at a tiny table behind the entrance wall... I went off on him.   Dude this place has l 30 emply tables and paper table cloths whats the problem?    Finally got a table.... I rate the food a 3/10 wont be back its just a headache to find parking and deal with BS on a 1 hr lunch break"}
{"text":"Great Indian food with an interesting \"spice level\" concept. 

Came here with my parents when we had an overnight layover in Charlotte while traveling back to SF. It's located in a brand new shopping center and is really fun to walk around and spend time in. 

The restaurant has nice outdoor seating, friendly service, and pretty good food. The presentation is especially nice on the dishes. It's definitely on the expensive side, but worth the price. 

They have an interesting concept called a spice scale where you can tell them to make your dish anywhere from a 1-10. My little sister got a 3 (mild) I got a 6 (medium) and my mom got an 8 (spicy). The food was delicious and it was nice to have the spicy-ness adjusted!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop by after shopping and this place is excellent! The entire staff was friendly and the food was seasoned to perfection! When we arrived we were unsure of what we wanted and they listened and offered suggestions based on what we said. 

I had the saffron tiki masala and spinach stuffed naan. They allow you to determine how spicy you want it and use the complimentary lentil chips and sauce as a gauge. We completed our meal with fresh and delicious rice pudding. 

I will definitely return."}
{"text":"What an experience, or lack thereof... I was invited to visit Saffron by one of my girlfriend's and thought it would be a great idea since I've never had Indian food. When we arrived,around 1pm or so, it was Very empty and quiet. They serve a lunch buffet which I thought would be a good idea since I would be able to try a few dishes. The food all tasted  the same.  Curry chicken wasn't spicy,  tiki marasala tasted like the curry and then there was tandoori CHICKEN!  When we first arrived, as soon as we sat down the server came and took our drink order. I asked for a sweet tea and the server failed to tell me they only serve non sweet. So I wasted  $2.45 on a drink I couldn't swallow and they didn't want to replace it to make me happy."}
{"text":"The staff is very attentive with the service and very happy to guide those unfamiliar with Indian cuisine. All of the dishes we tried were flavorful and rich."}
{"text":"Food was ok. We have been regular here today I took guest as well so we were 4 adult and a 2 year old toddler. My toddler eat only little jeera rice and gulab jamun and they charged him buffet price . Earlier they said kids under 6 they don't charge.. it was not about the money I told them no need to refund keep it as tip. The cashier/manager say we won't know who is sitting in the family room never coming back again"}
{"text":"Words cannot explain how good the food is here. And the service is extraordinary. The employees make you feel like you are having a home cooked meal with their family. Order outside your comfort zone and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Buffet is ok... Not bad. The dinner here is way better!! I would wait till dinner time to come and have a fun time. Food is still good no matter when you come."}
{"text":"Saffron is very \"so, so\" for the price of the food I would rather go to Blue Taj or Copper since they are highly superior... If you get food to go be warned to get very little rice .....  There is better out there ....."}
{"text":"Very Poor quality and No authenticity ! 

If you know what is what from Indian kitchen and looking for some authentic Indian food, well  this is not the place for you. Nothing tastes as it is supposed to. Ordered 3 items - Gobi Manchurian, Goat Biriyani and Malai Kofta. 2 of them were worst and 1 was Manageable. But thats not what you would want when you pay 50$. Had a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"The worst indian buffet I ever had. The biryani they served is not at all fresh and authentic biryani it's just chicken and rice. Never going again."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in this place. The atmosphere was all right and the staff was friendly. However, the food was rather tasteless. The palak paneer was watery, as was the other dishes on the buffet. The naan was really good, as was the samosa. Not the best Indian food. By the way, I went to the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Seriously, this place is AMAZING!  I have been here for both the lunch buffet and dinner, and this is some of the tastiest Indian food I've ever eaten.  It's not very close to home for me, but it's always worth the drive to come here.

The lunch buffet is absolutely fantastic.  I don't think I've ever eaten at one that serves samosas on it, but this one does and they're great.  The chicken tikka masala, as others pointed out, totally steals the show on the buffet.  I am normally not a fan of the rice pudding, but theirs has the perfect texture and level of sweetness.

At dinner time, this place is so intimate.  Now, I think the prices are a little higher than some of the other Indian places around, but the quality is just outstanding.  I love that they also offer dinner specials, as I don't think I've ever been to an Indian place that offers more than is on the menu.  The other night, I had a lamb shank curry that was just divine.  The meat was tender and flavorful, served right on the bone.  I was also very excited to see that they have saag here.  My partner ordered the chicken saag, and he repeatedly said it was the best he'd ever eaten.  Oh, and their rice is also wonderful, although at dinner time they just don't give you quite enough.

The decor is very elegant here.  The colors on the wall complement the dark wooden tables and chairs.  The service has been top-notch every time I've gone.  Since the food tends to be spicy, the wait staff does a great job of ensuring everyone has plenty of water to drink.

I am just sad this place is not closer to where I live."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian so of course Indian food is right up my alley. You'll find your classic curries and masalas, but Saffron really is a fantastic place to eat. My boyfriend and I have been there several times and I've told countless people about it.

Great atmosphere, excellent food, nice staff--you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"So I'm by no means a big fan of ethnic cuisine, so just getting me to eat at an Indian restaurant was a challenge. They're a fine dining Indian restaurant & we headed here for lunch one day.

The variety of the menu is kind of sparse for me, but maybe that's because it was all Indian food. I opted for the pizza, as close to an American dish as I could get. It was actually quite good & I would have never guessed I was eating ethnic food. Some other people at the table were a little more adventurous than me & ended up getting some stuff that didn't look too appetizing to me.

The atmosphere of the place is like your normal fine dining establishment, with white table clothes & the tables already set. It was kind of dead when we got there, but we probably missed the lunch crowd.

Apparently this is a high ranking restaurant in Charlotte, & #1 in Indian cuisine. I wish I could appreciate the food more, but I'd just rather stick to my American entrees."}
{"text":"I have never tried ala carte here yet but buffet is very ordinary if you are looking for authentic Indian taste. Kheer is the only thing that is worth a mention in buffet.  Decent ambience. Owner lady really needs to work on her attitude towards customers - very stuck-up and rude! Poor service!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the service has always been good, but the food is average.
I've gone for lunch with coworkers who had never had Indian food before so the lunch buffet was a good option for them. The only item on the buffet that had any spice to it was the samosas which I thought was strange.
I have also been here for dinner and I would say it is also an average experience."}
{"text":"When I'm lucky enough to work from home I sometimes meet one of my friends here for lunch since it's a neutral location for us.  When I first started coming to Saffron for the lunch buffet I thought it was mediocre at best.  At that time I thought everything was bland and just not that appetizing except maybe for the naan and I probably would have given Saffron 2 stars.  

I've been back recently; twice within the last few weeks to be exact and the food is sooo much better now.  I don't know what changes have been made but I can definitely tell a difference because the Tikka Masala is so much richer and fuller now and there seemed to be a much bigger lunch crowd.  I hope they keep up the great work!

The only down side is that they desperately need a fountain machine for refills instead of using 2-liter bottles.  I think it irritates them to pour too many refills or maybe my friend and I drink too much :).  

My hope right now is that they keep up the great food at the buffet and don't revert back to the old receipes!"}
{"text":"One of the most enjoyable and tasty Indian meals we have had anywhere. They were really attentive, gave great advice on some popular dishes to try and allowed us some samplings! The food was delicious and fresh. This is a new favorite for us!"}
{"text":"So good, so fast and such nice people  :-)  I feel very lucky to live near Saffron, because I love my Chicken Tikka, and when I have the need, Saffron knocks it out of the park every time  :-)  Thanks Saffron!"}
{"text":"I went to Saffron for the first time today and had the lunch buffet. The decor was nice and clean. The waiters were very attentive and didn't leave my glass empty and collected dirty dishes very quickly. I am vegan, so I can only comment on such items. They only had 3 dishes that were vegan friendly, a salad with dressing and samosas. They had more dishes containing meat than they did that were vegetarian. The best item they had was the samosas.

On to the food. I love rich, spicy foods. In this regard, Saffron did not deliver. The food was mildly spiced and didn't have a lot of flavor. I'm not saying it was bad, it just was too mellow for my liking. However, on the plus side, I could tell that the vegetables were fresh, not frozen/canned. They were not mushy at all and perfectly cooked. They got the part about using fresh vegetables right - now if only they would tweak the spices to be more exciting.

I only gave it 3 stars because of the lack of vegetarian/vegan selection, under enthusiastic spices and the upper price for a lunch buffet ($10). These are fixable problems, so I might give them another try if I see future reviews say they have improved. But for now, there are better, less expensive Indian buffets around."}
{"text":"I am not an Indian (American or Eastern) expert by an means, and I fully realize that my experience with the lunch buffet at Saffron may not be indicative of the quality of their food: It is simply to efficiently handle as many people as they can as quickly as they can, while allowing them to partake of a wide variety of offerings at the same time.

That said, and while I have been known to visit a buffet or two in my time, this may not be the one to visit. The food on the buffet, while reasonably tasty, is typically served at varying temperatures. I do not know if this is a \"feature\" of Indian cuisine, or if the buffet table itself was broken, not being an expert, I just know that there seemed to be a difference in the temperature level of some foods.

Also, while some buffets will provide good service - clearing plates, filling drinks, etc - Saffron is not one of them. The plates tend to stack up and the glasses empty quickly without being refilled. When someone makes it by, they are friendly enough, it's just that they seem understaffed - or busy doing other things.

Since they are on the other side of town, I'm not sure that I'd make the trip often."}
{"text":"Came here to meet a girlfriend for lunch. It was my first time here and I've heard nothing but good things about this place. It was easy to find but parking can be hectic but not a big deal. I went in and got a nice window seat. Everyone was very friendly. 

We got the buffet for lunch. I was super pleased with everything. There was a nice selection for vegetarian and non vegetarian. They had naan. Their tandoori chicken was delicious especially with the onions. I also like the tikka chicken masala. Overall, I was really happy with my meal. 

I will definitely come back. My husband wants to try this place too!"}
{"text":"Been here twice for Friday night dinner, place is unpopular during this time but FOOD IS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! Definitely recommend Chicken Korma, Lamb Vindaloo, Cheese Naan and Mango Lassi!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has poor service and quality. I've routinely seen them turn away customers more than 20 minutes before they're scheduled closing time. I was a victim of this type of behavior this past Friday night. While walking towards the restaurant I noticed an employee closing down the umbrellas. I checked the current time -9:57 pm, & checked online what time they closed on Fridays- 10:30. At that moment, the employee noticed me walking towards the restaurant and immediately went inside to turn the sign on the door from 'Open' to 'Closed'. It was hurtful and disheartening watching this occur right before my eyes. I walked away, while noting that the electronic 'Open' sign was still lit and that other customers were also turned away after I was.
I used to work in the service industry so I understand the necessity for closing at a proper time; however I've also worked in retail and have had employees of this place as customers and they have no problem walking into a store less than 5 minutes before closing time. 
It is unfortunate that this restaurant operates on such a double standard. While I enjoy their food, I will never eat here again because of the manner in which I was rudely turned away."}
{"text":"I picked up an order from Saffron earlier today. This is my second time picking up and the staff still remembered me! Super friendly service and they have got my order perfect both times. Other Indian places forget the naan all the time, when it's so crucial!! They respect if you don't want it hot or burn your tongue off if you ask for it. Price points are perfect! Love love love this place!!

If I have to say anything negative about this place it's that it was hard to find the first time- treasure often is!!! 

Five stars, I'll be back soon!!

{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that as an Indian-American, from New Jersey of all places, I have relatively high standards for Indian cuisine. With that said, I would give Saffron's food a 3.5 rating. However, their dreadful service (note other reviews) brings that down to about a 2-star. 

It is amazing how lousy the service could be even while the restaurant is half-full. I would stick to buffet here, considering even asking for onions/jalapenos (a common complimentary add-on from Indian restaurants) would run you an extra $2-3 dollars. Furthermore, the portions are not quite right from the entrees, so buffet is best:

Monday - Friday: $8.95 lunch buffet
Saturday: $9.95 lunch buffet
Sunday: $12.95 lunch buffet (includes beverage)

Ultimately, this place works if you are really craving Indian, but I have yet to find a consistently fantastic Indian spot in Charlotte. The search continues!!"}
{"text":"I eat at this place about once a month due to proximity to my job. The buffet is what I always get. The first few times I went to this establishment, it seemed like they never changed their buffet menu. The past two times I have gone they have switched the dishes out. As for flavor, Chicken tikka Masala is my favorite dish and their variation of it is pretty bland. That's my only real complaint other than the variety of the buffet. I have tried some of the other dishes and they were full of flavor. The prices are very reasonable and the staff is nice."}
{"text":"Yummy! I eat here regularly. It conveniently located, the prices are fair and the service is good. I'm not a big fan of the buffet but a lot of my friends are, so I would try it out for the price."}
{"text":"This establishment is amazing and first class. Starting with the pleasant scent that greets you once entered along with friendly staff that aims to serve. The menu is very organized into meat and veggie groups and allows to easily find that new favorite dish of yours. The chicken tikka masala was outstanding. The rich blend of flavor and heat allowed for perfect pleasure to my palette. The chai was simply good, just like my dad made it at home growing up. Overall great value at decent prices. Check it out. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Awesome food. I was passing by carowinds, Charlotte. This is one of the beat Indian restaurant. Paneer makhani's gravy is spicy and tangy. U wanna try this!!

the best gulab jamun I had in india. As an indian, I recommend everyone to please try this. Don't miss it. Have some space for your dessert ;)"}
{"text":"This place is nice. The food options are great,  the prices are a bit on the higher side, particularly, because the food was a bit bland. This is why I am giving it only four stars. It has a nice ambience, plenty of parking and the waiters and staff are absolutely phenomenal. Very welcoming, attentive, and respectful. I ordered an appetizer and an Indian beer and as a main dish Vindaloo chicken. There wasn't much chicken but the rice was very good. I liked that you get to choose how spicy you would like to have your dish. I chose 10 (the highest/spiciest) and it was challenging and exactly what I needed. I will come back again to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday with a friend for the lunch buffet. I'm not one to really care for buffets but I have been wanting to try an Indian one for awhile. For about $9 I ate samosas, naan, a spinach & chickpea dish, aloo gobi, & vegetable biryani. My stomach did feel weird the rest of the day but it may have been because I ate 3 huge plates of food!Definitely hit the spot for my Indian food craving.  

Service was nice, although a bit slow on refilling water. I will admit I probably drink way more water than normal people when I go out to eat. I also ordered a chai tea & I guess it wasn't what I was used to because it tasted really watered down. Our total bill for 2 lunch buffets & a chai tea came out to under $23 not including the tip but we left happy & stuffed. Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"My Husband and I have a wonderful meal every time we dine. Friendly staff and amazing food. Chicken tiki Marsala is to die for. Naan both garlic and cheese is amazing. Don't forgot the Flying Horse beer!!!!"}
{"text":"Saffron is good because they refill the food often so it stays warm and fresh. Also, the service is very friendly and they keep their restaurant clean. The naan was pretty good, and I loved the tandoori chicken, but I wish there was more variety in general and more spicy options.

What I didn't like was the arrangement of the buffet. Way too cramped especially when I am rushing to eat my plate full of food! Also, the table they sat us at was terrible for buffet-ing because it was a booth and hard to get in and out. They need more veggies.

Overall it was a good experience. Recommended for the $8.95 lunch buffet!"}
{"text":"This doesn't surpass the Indian restaurant I frequent in California but this qualifies as very tasty. I ordered the Tandoori chicken, mushroom matar, naan and chicken curry. The naan had a slightly different flavor than what I'm accustomed to but it was good."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I have orders good form here but this past time just was not good at all. Very disappointed. The naan was under cooked and chewy. The chicks tiki Marsala was watered down and didn't have much flavor. Usually it's creamy but it just was very bland this time. In addition they gave much less chicken than normal they were small pieces and not a ton. The samosa was normal other than the reddish sauce was also very watered down. Not sure what's going on but hope they fix the issues."}
{"text":"I come and eat here 2 o 3 times a week. The only reason is not a 5 stars is because they don't have a lot of variety. 

My favorite combination is white rice, chicken masala and Tandoori Chicken, with 2 o 3 pieces of Naan. I can (and I do) eat that 2 o 3 times before leaving. Staff is really friendly, they keep your drinks full and are very attentive. 

The place has a very dim light, I personally don't like that, but you get used to the ambience pretty quickly."}
{"text":"This is a very pleasant place to dine. The food is full of fragrant spices, and is delicious. The wait staff is very attentive."}
{"text":"Great place for take out!  The chicken tikka masala is tasty and their garlic naan is the best when dipped in the masala sauce.  I also tried their samosa and it's decent.  Beware of the spicy though...from 1 to 10, I chose 8 and it was spicer than I thought.  Maybe I will stick with 5 next time."}
{"text":"We have been enjoying Saffron's dining experience for years and it is our favorite Indian restaurant.  The staff has a been courteous, attentive, and willing to teach customers about their different dishes.  We have seen this restaurant grow over the years and we are no longer the only non-Asian customers, which is wonderful to see as the Ayrsley Development has grown to become a vibrant locale. The is now a small park and outdoor seating to enjoy the weather and people watch.  The food tend to have wonderful flavors and textures.  I try to order something different on each busy and have not been disappointed yet.

An excellent example this past visit was our wonderful waiter, Vinay!  He was kind, pleasant, happy, and helpful.  His friendliness was contagious and it spread from one table to another ."}
{"text":"Definitely not the best Indian food I've had, but probably the most expensive.

Chicken Tikka and Lamb without any sauce?!?! Why would I even want those dishes then."}
{"text":"I ate lunch at Saffron on a Saturday, it wasn't very busy, just one other person.  The restaurant was quite nice, a white table cloth kind of place.  But for lunch it was pretty casual.  They have a very reasonable priced, &9.95, lunch buffet so I was able to try out quite a few dishes.  Everything I tried was very good.  They had about two types of rice, about 4 vegetable dishes plus about 4 chicken dishes on the buffet along with a little bit of salad, rice pudding, and carrot pudding, oh and of course naan.  Everything was hot and very well prepared.  I really don't know much about Indian cuisine, but I like art, I know what I like.  The chicken tikka masala was my favorite with the tandori chicken a close second.  The wait staff was very friendly and since it was very slow service was excellent.  If you like Indian cuisine then put Saffron on you list to visit.  If you are not quite sure or haven't tried Indian cuisine, then go for the lunch buffet so you can sample a little of everything."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and excellent food. Highly recommend this place if you are interested in great Indian food. About one year ago we came here for the first time and visited at least a dozen times. Never disappointed. Again: great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Buffet is pretty good. I enjoyed the variety of Indian food on it. It was reasonably priced so I was happy for what I paid. I'll probably go back for lunch."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed by this place, not gonna lie. I was mad craving Indian food (I always do) so I dragged my bf here. We got the chicken manchurian to start, and then he got the chicken tikka masala and I got the chicken vindaloo with a side of garlic naan and raita. The chicken manchurian was okay but I thought it was a bit overpriced. Tikka masala was decent, but the vindaloo tasted nothing like vindaloo and it tasted like the sauce was pre-made out of a box. I was also disappointed that neither the naan nor the raita were included, but that doesn't really influence my rating here. Spice level - they definitely veer on the mild side here. I got a 5 out of 10 and thought it was a teeny bit spicy but nothing too crazy. So if you like mild, come here!

I will say that the portions are good and their Indian beers are fun to try as well. Service was also great. However, next time I'd like to try an Indian place in Charlotte that tastes a bit more homemade."}
{"text":"An always attentive staff and available spicy chilli sauce to liven up the buffet items make this one of my favorites. The meat options are pretty static day to day, but the vegetable options are regularly switched up. Ordered take out and the lamb rogan josh did not disappoint! Definitely my favorite lunch spot in that part of town."}
{"text":"Food is ok. But they are not for families. You ll get sent to some room behind the restrooms if you have a kid. In simple words - Discrimination. Go through the not recommended reviews at the bottom of the screen. Why would I come back if I am given some bull reason for being seated there if I don't prefer? I don't mind the seclusion, but it should be my choice however. Anyway, they reserve the right. I ll not come back..."}
{"text":"If you are from india and like indian style spicy food, its good option to dine in. Dinner is pretty much close to indian style and taste than lunch buffet. Lunch buffet is average.
If you are an indian and love spicy, go for 8 in spice scale. Non indians can go for 5-6 for the first time, and can try 7 next time. If you cannot have spicy, go for 5 or less.
Menu is good and you get sufficient options if you like food sharing in group."}
{"text":"This is one of those few Indian restaraunts that never seams to fail in all aspects. Their food is flawlessly perfect, the price is great, their service is prompt and everything looks clean and fresh. I HIGHLY recomend going for their Sunday Brunch."}
{"text":"Very good, not as spicy as I would like but would go again.  The YELP delivery did not work.  There was instructions from my end and on my confirmation that did not make it to the restaurant  or the delivery tag."}
{"text":"Pretty good lunch buffet...would have liked a little bigger selection, but what we had was good."}
{"text":"Two days in a row with the takeout, but we're working on the kitchen (well, technically, my wife is working on the kitchen) and cooking is difficult. I popped out to Saffron for dinner. Two chicken curries, a saag aloo and riata with a garlic naan made it home. The portions were reasonable with a good amount of chicken in each of the curries and plenty of sauce. Each also had a tub of excellent jasmine rice. Yum.

Naan was excellent but one order for two people wasn't enough. Next time, two orders!"}
{"text":"So I've had the lunch buffet here once; was alright. I thought the dal and chicken curry was very tasty. The rest was just OK. Based on it's potential my husband and I dined there last night & ordered a paneer tikka for appetizer & the special for the day-goat curry (which comes with rice). a) the paneer tikka quantity for $7 was a shocker. It was TINY and worse than that, the paneer was definitely old. It was hard and had rubbery corners. When we passed on the feedback to our server (point to note: very politely, making it known that we just wanted it cleared because the paneer tasted stale), he actually argued back saying the paneer was fresh. That felt rather inappropriate. The goat curry looked great but was almost tasteless. No salt, no spice :-( I was disappointed in all."}
{"text":"When I need a tikka marsala fix, this is the place I go. Their saffron chicken tikka marsala is possibly the best tikka marsala I've ever had. There is a really nice anise flavor to sauce, and they're willing to make it spicy for me (although CTM isn't traditionally a spicy dish). It's definitely a good place to hit if you're heading to Ayrsley Cinema for a movie."}
{"text":"I'm not an expert on Indian cuisine, with that said the lunch buffet was a great way to sample some different items without being too overwhelmed. The staff was nice and answered my questions (basically the same question over and over \"What's in this?\"). 

I thought the Chicken Tikka Masala was really good and worth checking out."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've worked around corner from this place for four years and never been here! Absolutely delicious!! I had the lunch buffet. $8.95 all you can eat. What a joke! In a good way that is. I stuffed myself silly in just two trips. The buffet doesn't have all the items available on the menu but for the money you're going to get great value. Very friendly and attentive staff, very clean restaurant, very great place to eat. I will be coming back here often!!"}
{"text":"I was back. This place rocks. Great food!! Great service, well of course it's a buffet. I took three out of town guests and they all loved this place. Authentic cuisine of India. Awesome place."}
{"text":"Decent price and its a buffet!

This is only my second different Indian restaurant I have been to. As far as selection of food and by price this is now my favorite. I am still discovering Indian cuisine and so far I really like it. 

Now for those of you that are familiar with Indian cuisine I will say that this is a buffet, so if you like spicy this is not the place for you. However if you want a nice lunch with a good selection at a good price then this place is wonderful. 

The lunch buffet Monday - Friday is only $8.95! 

I recommend here if your a beginner with Indian cuisine, for the price and selection of the buffet, and if your an expert on Indian cuisine and you you don't mind the mildness of the buffet."}
{"text":"Coming through town on my way to a wedding, Saffron was a good choice for a lunch with two good friends. Their lunch buffet, which I've had before, was pretty great. The dishes change fairly regularly from what I've been told, but everything is pretty tasty save for the samosas, which are really greasy and pretty bland. I'm horrible with the names of Indian food - but the chicken masala was great, the \"chef's special\" rice, the spinach and potatoes dish plus a few others I couldn't hope to remember the names of. The naan is good too. 

For $9, this is a great lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere for dinner! We had samosas for starters which were pretty nice. I feel that some samosas have a bit of a frozen and then flash-fried taste but these tasted pretty fresh and had plenty of filling. I had channa aloo masala (a chickpea and potato dish) and my husband had chicken tikka masala.  When you go for dinner you will be asked for your spice preference on a scale of 1-10. I chose 7 and was very pleased! I love spicy food and it was perfect for me. My husband chose 10 and loved his as well. Very friendly staff and a laid back atmosphere. Definitely will return especially with the Groupon!"}
{"text":"Got take out, 10 spicy scale chicken vindaloo and the chicken was super juicy and it was definitely the spiciest. Not too spicy where I couldn't eat some of it, but hot enough for my brother who needs everything to be very very spicy."}
{"text":"Yay Saffron is yummy. It is the only indian restaurant I've tried in the QC, but thats absolutely fine. I don't need to look any further. I've eaten at many Indian restaurants back home in CA and Saffron is up there with the best of them. It is a \"fine dining\" style so dishes are a little pricier than normal, but worth it.

Tandoori chicken is good. Enough spice. Curry is also excellent. fairly spicy, but they can control the heat for ya. The naan is excellent. Their garlic naan is also yummy. 

The staff is very friendly and will explain any dish if needed. I highly recommend it. it isn't too traditional that it will scare away some folks. It's a good introduction into indian food imho."}
{"text":"I had a craving for Indian food and in Steele Creek your options are...Saffron. Thankfully, they have excellent food. I always order Samosa's and they were excellent. I had the Tikka Chicken Marsala. It was creamy, spicy, and hit right into the spot of Indian craving. The garlic  naan was very good. My wife ordered Shimp Tikka Marsala, also very delicious. They have a small wine selection here, but you aren't really coming for that. They also have some mixed drink specials, but I didn't partake. I had sparking water. The only downside is the restaurant was freezing cold the night I went. It was cold outside, and I never got warm inside either. I wore my coat the entire meal as did most of the patrons. I probably should have complained, but generally I don't like to. They are also very friendly with good service."}
{"text":"We try to go for the buffet when i have a day off from work and it's always great.  Friendly staff, nice mix on the buffet, and just pretty.... The food is not heavily seasoned or spicy but very well done.  You won't walk out sweating but you'll know you had something good :)"}
{"text":"Good food but the service was terrible. Forgot to bring my kids food and another side.  The people behind never did get the correct drink order from them.  We will not be coming back again.  They never even apologized for the inconvenience of it all."}
{"text":"Not sure why the reviews are so low, because Saffron serves some really solid Indian cuisine in SW Charlotte. It's the closest Indian restaurant near me, so I've been a handful of times. The service has always been friendly and attentive and they aced my go-to Palak Paneer each time. 

The buffet is also very reliable if you want an affordable, quick, tasty Indian food. 

Tip: Flip through those coupon mailers, because I recently found some coupons that'll save you 15% of dinner as well as a buy-one-get-one-free one."}
{"text":"I am completely in love with this place. I really enjoy the paneer!! The owners are fabulous and nice. I haven't had anything there I didn't love. One of the best (if not THE best) Indian place"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. I got the kahratan korma (spl?), very very good. Our party of 8 seemed to be very impressed with their individual dishes as well even though most of them were Indian N00bz"}
{"text":"Great food!  I always get the lamb chop, it's not on the menu but it's amazing!  Buffets are good too  (sunday is a special buffet! ) #yummy"}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is high quality and has a lot of options. Fairly quiet and quaint atmosphere. Prompt and friendly service."}
