{"text":"Clean, friendly, superb value and visually v.appealing. But as someone else here has said, looks better than it tastes."}
{"text":"I used to love this place because of their nutty, crispy fried chicken and pork bbq, but now the flavor was not there anymore. The chicken and pork bbq were so bland. The food degraded and worst the pork steak was not edible and stinks. My husband was so disappointed and might get food poisoned because of the expired pork steak. I will not be back in this place again. People should get what they deserve not expired meat."}
{"text":"Tasty takeout at a decent price.

I actually didn't know this was a restaurant until today. I thought that it was store that sold children's clothes. I was planning on visiting the takeout next door, but was told that it was not open until noon. The guy working out front pointed me towards Jollytops, which makes me think that maybe they're owned by the same guy.

It was actually pretty busy there. It's a simple takeout spot with a few tables and a tv showing some Filipino variety show. 

The lady at the counter was helpful, and pretty no-nonsense. She wasn't unfriendly, but she wasn't friendly, either. She answered all my stupid questions, which must have been confusing because most people think I'm from the Philippines, including the guy who pointed me to this place. 

I got Combo #1: 1 dish, 1 rice and a drink. I got some pork belly thing, rice and a coconut juice (50 cents extra). I paid by debit (25 cents extra). It was $7.40 all told, not bad.

When I got back to work, I opened up my package to find that the lady had put shrink wrap over the container with the meat in it, to keep the sauce from leaking all over the place. You know who else does that? MY MOM. Great touch! 

At the first bite, I thought \"wow, this is REALLY tasty. But... there's a bone or something in it...\" when I fished it out, it was actually a plastic clothing tag. Kind of a strange coincidence, considering I thought this was a clothing store. Whatever, things happen. If I were eating there, I probably would have said something, but out of all the unwanted things you can find in your food, this is on the lower level of grossness.

The dish was great. Very flavourful and the pork belly was really soft and fatty. There was a layer of fat over the sauce. Perfect. My only complaint would be that there were no veggies included in the combo. 

A balanced meal this is not, but next time I want something cheap in the neighbourhood that isn't a pizza or corned beef, I'll check this place out again.

Cash and debit only. Parking is sparse."}
{"text":"The halo-halo taste bland and so expensive. Why don't you improve your serving. You and Cabalen are the same.
Another the Sisig is full of pork fats, only small amount  of meat."}
{"text":"Your spaghetti is very red,are you guys trying to save money by putting food colouring than tomato sauce!!! And No cheese??!! Filipino spaghetti always have cheese and you charge what???! $10 for this!! You only want to make money without quality?!"}
{"text":"Ordered:
Palabok, $7.50
2 pcs chicken with spaghetti, $8.50

The palabok did not taste as good as it was before.  When I came home to eat it, it had a \" weird \" taste.

Either it changed its chef or changed owners.   The spaghetti also did not taste the same as before."}
{"text":"Came here to purchase their 'maruya' which is a fritter from the Philippines made with batter and saba bananas and then sprinkled with sugar.

The trick is to serve these fresh from the fryer to prevent getting a mouthful of soggy nothings that activate the gag reflex, which in this case sadly happened. 

Only and ONLY when it's fresh is when this Filipino snack favourite is crispy and pleasant to eat, just like any fried battered dishes. 

If I had in brought in a friend from a different background and presented them with my homeland's popular snack, it would've been a big miss and a disgrace that something so simple, can be poorly executed and served to paying customers.

Jollytops, kindly have these removed from your menu and work on improving quality and serve these 'maruyas' fresh and never more than a day old. 

Some of your dishes are really good, it would really suck if a person's experience gets overshadowed with one dish that's pretty hard to mess up."}
{"text":"So mad at this place right now! They give you the option to choose from small , medium and large container of any dish so we ordered large sinigang na bangus expecting that they would fill it up just like any other dish which they did except the sinigang na bangus which i find it funny and makes you mad at the same time and thinking in my head \"is this a joke!? I paid $4.50 for this?\" One stupid slice of fish and some broth and not so generous with the veggies!!! How can you not find this funny and makes you furious too  you should let your costumer know in the beginning if some of your dish only has one size and not act surprised that we should have known because i don't at all. One lady even says you can pick any size small/med/large and we'd still charge you the same price... WHAT!?!? You're kidding me right!? Makes me not want to come back here anymore. So disappointing!"}
