{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time tonight and we really liked it! The staff was very friendly. We ordered an appetizer and they were out of part of what it came with usually, so they substituted it with something even better. We got the orange chicken and Sing High fried rice, both of which were very good. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Walked in and waited to be seated like the sign said.... This big samoan looking dude then got up and walk over to the counter with a look on his face as if I was bothering him... He asks what can I help you with????? (well genious this is a Restaurant) I told him just one.... He then had a short exchange of words in some disagreement with another worker. He walked me to the middle of the mostly empty restaurant. I asked if I could have the corner booth. (I prefer corner booths) he said you can have that one and pointed at a booth mot near the corner then said that other one is for like four more people.... 

Well I thought it's almost 3pm not quite lunch rush and it's pretty much empty why the Fuck can't I sit where I want I am about to buy food here. I guess the customer is not right at this place. 

A simple request not during lunch rush. So I left.
Poor customer service from the moment I walked in the staff seamed irritated with my walking in... 

Don't go here. Find a friendlier Chinese spot"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a prime example of why places that have been around forever aren't necessarily the greatest places to eat. I have seen this place for years and finally made it inside. After eating there, I wish I hadn't bothered.

We were seated quickly and took a look at the menu, where entrees like  \"Beef with Tomatoes\" were on the menu. We should have known we were in trouble when the description of that dish was \"beef with tomatoes and other vegetables\" (guess they didn't want to commit on what was actually in the dish).

We had ordered 2 dishes and 2 bowls of soup to cover the $20 we had to spend with our restaurant.com certificate. Even though the bill was over $20, we were told we didn't order enough. We then tried to order dessert, but we were told that dessert wasn't food and the certificate was food only (who knew ice cream wasn't food). We ordered an egg roll and waited for our food.

The dishes were terrible. The \"Spicy Pineapple Pork\" was neither spicy, nor had any pineapple. It tasted of ketchup and vinegar with some pork. The \"Sa-Te Beef\" was beef in a mystery sauce. The rice was terrible. Normally, we take our leftovers home from a Chinese restaurant, but didn't bother. 

Save your money and go to Panda Express instead. The food is equally terrible, but they probably know that dessert is food."}
{"text":"Good food &  good people! Hard to find both..... Its a hole in the wall place that u don't want to pass up.The pot stickers are amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"This place used to have really good food. Now you get more than half of your plate covered in bean sprouts. I think its over priced for what you get.

I've always had good service here."}
{"text":"i love this place  i was first introduced to this small piece of heaven be by a friend and have been coming back ever since. i now have my husband hooked on their food especially their eggrolls. but my all time favorite dish here is the chicken cantonese noodles... soooo goood"}
{"text":"So sad :(  All you Arizona natives know this place.  Remember the round tables with the waxy tablecloths? The waitresses were quick and efficient and the food came out in waves, but it's different now.  Order an egg roll and you'll notice it looks like a deep fried Twinkie, try the chop suey and it's time for a game of Find the Meat .  Things are quite different now and, unfortunately, the owners don't seem to care if you like it or not.  I'm sad and I miss the old Sing High.  Without China Doll to fill the void I'm at a loss for good Chinese food in the downtown area.  I need a time machine."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant when I was in Phoenix but it's not the same as I remember.  I remember the food being really good delicious Chinese cuisine but on my recent return visit, the food has gone south of the road!!!
The service was poor, the waitress kept coming to our table to see if we were through eating.  The food was less than amazing, it was greasy and didn't taste that good."}
{"text":"yuk - don't waste your time and money on cheap chinese food. i guess lunch might not be as bad as dinner. I went there for dinner - food looked pretty bad and taste was every worse."}
{"text":"I've been going to Sing High since I was kid- over 30 years. Great food at a great value! Their chop suey is awesome! All flavors."}
{"text":"This place is old school Chinese food, and it does not disappoint. The ingredients are always fresh and the volume of food is outstanding for the price. You will definitely need a take home box! When I was there, there was a very nice woman prepping fresh snow peas at a table next to the kitchen. They were very fresh and looked excellent in quality. And the egg rolls are AWESOME.

Note to all the one, two and three star reviewers. You don't go to Sing High for the decor, or the service. You go to Sing High for the food, period. It's a great place to go and hang out for a leisurely dinner. 

Sing High is what it is and does not pretend to be anything else. It reminds me of several restaurants in China Town in San Francisco, right down to the table cloths."}
{"text":"This is my another restaurant I have been going to since I was  a child.  I've enjoyed their bbq pork fried rice for about 25 years. Sing High's pork fried rice is the best I have ever had.  I will never eat rice at any other restaurant because I know that this rice can not be equalled. They also have great chow mein, fried shrimp and sweet and sour pork. Their prices are pretty good. The food is sooo good  that I make this 30 mile trip once a week."}
{"text":"Just because it's a \"downtown staple\" do not feel like you need to experience this eatery. Service was mediocre, food was not great. Asked if we were ready to order within 30 seconds of sitting down, then asked again 30 seconds later. Paid cash and change was not an option. Guess they take the tip that they want. Better places to visit downtown."}
{"text":"Everything tastes Dirty and smells like feet... The only think I could stand to eat is the Moo Goo Gai Pan but they have sooooo much celery and water chestnuts in it that it is just so overwhelming!"}
{"text":"Thee most incredible orange chicken& everything else. I'm in absolute awe of this place. I'm going back ASAP. Try it now!"}
{"text":"The food is good... But not worth the crappy customer service. When I can in, they had only a few other people seated. It took 20 minutes just to get someone to take our order, they never apologized or thanked us for our patience. The servers don't appreciate your business. After waiting to get our orders in, it too an additional 35 minutes to bring out our hot tea and food.... Very frustrating experience. Save your time and sanity and eat elsewhere!"}
{"text":"If you happen to come across this little hole in the wall. The thought might pop into your head that this will be one of those great hidden gems. Well let me tell you know. Its not.

According to my mother it used to be amazing a decade ago. But no longer. To be fair the gigantic hole in the ceiling right before you enter should have been our first clue. But it was almost 6pm and I hadn't eaten all day. Not to mention I've eaten amazing food in way shadier places. So we went in. The place is roomy, lots of parking and places to sit. But the decor mixed with the soft jazz they play is reminiscent of an old school gangster film. I spent my whole meal waiting for Sollozzo and McCluskey to meet their end.

As for the food. I was shocked there was so little vegeterian friendly options. Which lead me to order an awkward looking plate of vegetables and chow mein. What it really was a can of hard noodles under a mix of onions and bean sprouts. With a mystery flavorless white sauce drenched through out. My not vegeterian associate got the sweet and sour shrimp. Which was ridiculously over battered. I was so hungry and disatiasfied with my meal I found myself eating her leftover batter. Which still had a bit of sweet and sour sauce on it. The sauce was probably the only redeeming factor food wise. We did have a nice and fast waitress.

Long story short, I ate a grilled cheese when I got home."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes, and expectations.  Turned out to be a horrible experience.  The food tasted as if it came straight out of a can.  The service was even worse.  The staff was slow, and brought me a check for nearly $30 more than it should have been.  After 10 minutes of arguing with the waitress, I FINALLY got her to understand that we hadn't ordered items that were on the bill.  I will not be back, and suggest you save your time and money and avoid the place altogether."}
{"text":"The food here is always great. The sing high fried rice is excellent! Fresh made to order. I always get an egg roll as well which are large in size. The service is always fast too."}
{"text":"Trust this review. Simply just avoid. The cook(s) have zero pride in what they are serving. Zero. What a disappointing shame to the culture of Asian food and a waste of money."}
{"text":"General's chicken was tasty- surprisingly mild and subdued- but good flavor. Friend had daily special of pork- he enjoyed it but when i tasted it, i thought it tasted \"off\", much like meat going bad.  He, however, insisted it was good.  I enjoyed mine, would go again if friends suggested, but would definately not choose it on my own."}
{"text":"Dam! Were do I start? The place smells bad when you first walk in so make sure u hold ur nose so that you don't smell the air. The bathroom was dirty and paper towels on the floor.  The walls were dirty and needed to be cleaned. All of the staff was watching tv while we waited for the food and the drinks. We asked for a straw once we got our drinks and never got them, asked for them several times for a straw! Bad service all together. The food that I had was the number 2 and that was gross! The noodles were under cooked and the shrimp was dripping with oil. The rice was ok to eat because that was only one cooked. The egg roll was dripping with grease and it didn't look and taste like an egg roll. I don't know if the fryer was hot enough, because there was too much dough on them. I don't really know if I will be back to this place! If I could I would give half a star for this."}
{"text":"My experience at Sing High's was above average when compared to a typical experience at a fast food joint, such as Panda Express. I'm not a Chinese food expert, mainly because I've never visited China, but I could compare it to food I am familiar with, fast food. When I eat at a restaurant, I evaluate it on service, food, and atmosphere. Sing High's disappointed me with their service because the waitress, who seemed to be as old as the eighty-year-old restaurant, accommodated my family with constant refills; however, when my cup finally became vacant, she disappeared into the abyss. Granted it was somewhat busy, since it was 5:00 PM on a Sunday, but I observed she did not tend any other tables. She has waited on my family in the past, which means I should have the luxury of my one complementary refill without having my father go near the kitchen to ask her. However, my experience with their food was phenomenal. I enjoyed my Cantonese Style Chicken Lo Mein, which had a thick, rich gravy mixed in it with medium-sized pieces of chicken. Out of any Chinese dish I've eaten, this was by far the most filling and delicious, not only because of its decent price tag of $7.50, but due to the massive, towering portion. This Lo Mein is tastier than the Chow Mein at Panda Express, and is more satisfying than having any two-entrée plate from Panda. 
     The atmosphere was nothing fancy. Even though it doesn't have the crowded feel as a Panda express, it still had an average restaurant feel. The restaurant felt as if it hadn't been updated to a more modern look, mostly because of the faded color plates. I expected more of a Chinese appearance, but the atmosphere, in this case, was not as important as the food. The food was the best feature, and completely dominated the service and atmosphere in my criteria. Overall, if you're in the Central Phoenix area and craving tasty Chinese food, I recommend Sing High's."}
{"text":"why did I return here? after over a year of saying I would never come back because the service was terrible. the place smelled old and musty.the restrooms were small and musty. my so called shrimp was nothing but heavily battered fatty something deep fried wrapped around teensie tiny shrimp topped with more deep fried chip things?  it was all so nasty and I know the dishes weren't properly washed. the poor waitress's are so old I don't dislike aged people I love them actually but in a restaurant where its super busy although I still can't figure out why they can't hustle when they should. I'm never coming back here."}
{"text":"By far my most favorite Chinese spot! My family has been going here since I was a kid and the staff remembers our family. The decor hasn't changed and neither has the food, which is delicious! I love the beef chow mein and the crispy chicken. It's soo good."}
{"text":"The service was ok but the food came so fast like it was already cooked. The sweet and sour pork were Hugh with to much batter and just alittle peace of meat with hardly no sauce and hard. My kids looked at it and was like what is that after I told them they tasted the sweet and sour pork and said it had a funny taste. So I was not satisfied with their food."}
{"text":"Definitely not what I was expecting. The fried rice was very generic and the sweet and sour pork was only 3 pieces. The pieces seemed like they were on steroids and not in a good way. The mushrooms in the almond chicken seemed like they were fresh out of the can, mmmm. :/  So if you are like myself and enjoy fresh ingredients, do yourself a favor and run!"}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first time the other night.. Biggest plus for the place is that it has its own parking with some one checking to make sure you are there for the restaurant, the one thing I hate about downtown is parking. 

On to the food, a basic dinner of Pork fried rice, chicken chow mien, and Kung Pao chicken... It was okay. The Pork fried rice was basic and the chow mien was too slimy. The Kung Pao chicken was alright, kind of disappointed in its lack of sauce but the veggies and almonds that came where good. Pretty much, this place is good for quick and cheap food.

The staff was helpful and kind and the restaurant had a cute downtown vibe to it with a random birdcage in the middle. Overall I would try it again, but will try something different on the menu."}
{"text":"Ok I will make is Short and sweet.This place is the worst! The Hot and Sour soup has ZERO taste to it all pepper,,,The Egg Rolls should be called Grease Rolls! The Chop Suey I dont know what it was? It had seriously 4 or 5 pieces of Chicken in it.PLEASE DONT waste your money here!"}
{"text":"This has been a go to place for my family since I was a toddler, I am now 25 and take my own children to sing high. The best wonton soup ever!!! It does not look like much but has been a staple in downtown Phoenix for years with awesome to die for food!"}
{"text":"The food was good. The sevice was bad. No refills on ice tea. No checking back with us even though we were in eye sight of the server and the cashier while they texted on their phones. Finally I waved both arms and got the cashiers attention. She told the server and the server had to finish her texting before she got up to help us. Hey, if you just gotta text, do it in the back and check on your tables more than once."}
{"text":"This restaurant was across the street from our hotel, so we thought we would give it a try. I'm sorry, but this was the worst Chinese I've ever attempted to eat, and I'll eat just about anything."}
{"text":"I went to Sing High thirty minutes before the Suns game on Sunday. It was my mistake because it took longer than i thought it would have.

When we first go their we were greeted by a nice lady who took us to our seats. We looked though the menu and before our drinks came to us, we were ready to order. 

An elderly waitress took our order and drinks. I ran out of water and only had one glass the whole time i was there. Then after waiting for a while, our appetizer came. Pot stickers.

They were good and we demolished them. Partly because we were hungry, mostly because they were good. I have had pot stickers all over the place, but these are my favorite so far. 

As I ran out of water, our food came and we had to ask for two plates so we could share our dishes. My friend and I order two plates. My favorite Beef Fried Rice and she got Bell Pepper Beef.

You can't go wrong with Beef Fried Rice, but the Bell Pepper Beef was decent. If anything the lady who was serving us, was sweet and polite. You can't beat that. 

I am going to go back to SIng High because it has that older Chinese restaurant feel i like so much. I only hope they improve the next time i am there, so I can give them the five stars iI think they deserve."}
{"text":"We love this place and have been going there for years! The food is great and Harlen and Karleen always make sure you feel just like family! Great place to grab some egg rolls and hot & sour soup before a Dbacks or Suns game! My wife loves the Happy Family Meal. We even threw my inlaws their 25th anniversary party here... had a party of 20 something ppl and it was great!"}
{"text":"The food was great.  I had the almond chicken.  The food was very hot
and there was a lot of it. The vegetables tasted fresh.  I would have liked more rice."}
{"text":"Like many yelpers, I too have wanted to eat here for many years.  Not knowing why I kept skipping the place my wife and I finally made a stop.  Everyone will give this place a bad rating because of how beat up and aged this place is but lets be honest here.  The place is a chinese joint, very little focus to the aesthetics and I know very few places that are this old and still around.  

The Food is good, say all you want about the details in the restrooms and the side rooms but the food is very good.  We ordered multiple items and they have some great dishes, my favorite is the lo mein (catonese style) the pork selections where also yummy.  

This place reminded me of my local chinese place in LA when I was a kid and I will look forward to coming back.  For those that are thinking of trying please don't let this rating overall discourage you, just try it!"}
{"text":"Husband and I tried to eat lunch here yesterday.  Our original plans were to try Arrogant Butcher, but I was in a bit of a hurry, and thought Sing High would be faster.  Wrong!

We arrived just before the noon rush.  We were seated quickly and the waitress took our order almost immediately.  Husband ordered the lemon chicken and I ordered the mu shu pork.  Then, thirty minutes passed.  No waitress coming by to tell us the food would take a while, or refill our drinks, or ask if we wanted anything else.  Nothing.  So..... We Left.  The one star really is for the service, we actually didn't taste the food.  Not a good place to come if you need a quick lunch.  Why have a restaurant downtown if you aren't going to be able to cater to quick lunches on the go?"}
{"text":"I couldn't eat here. My egg roll was unrecognizable and not appetizing. The chow mein looked like someone gave birth to it. Hot and slimy. I sent it back and the waitress got angry."}
{"text":"Great place to have some good Chinese food for lunch. I always get the orange chicken. I also have to say that they seem to be one of the few places left that DON'T use green onions in their crab puffs, yay! Their staff can be a little rough around the edges but I guess you just get used to it because I keep going back for more."}
{"text":"I am kind of frustrated by this place, some things are very good and some are just so-so.  My wife had the orange chicken and ordered it spicy.  It was very tasty.  the BBQ pork has a good flavor but it riddled with fat.  The fried wonton is just bizarre tasting.  The sweet and sour pork tastes ok but it overly breaded.  This place is an icon but it could be a destination if it cleaned up its act a little.  My wife and I enjoyed some of our food but the kids weren't excited about anything (which is unusual for chinese food)."}
{"text":"Dropped in this hole in the wall on a whim as we were driving home from PAM. As soon as you step inside you are transported back to the late 70's early 80's AZ. This place reminded me of spots I used to do e at with my folks as a kid. Classic. 

The service was prompt, and friendly, but not overbearing, which is our preference. We had the pot stickers - which were amazing; the chop suey with all whit chicken - very tasty, and the fried rice.  For two people, this was plenty of food.

The prices were very reasonable.

This place is old school. You can tell the food is made from fresh ingredients - not pre-mixed, pre-packaged, like other Chinese places. 

Loved it. 3 generations from the same family have owned and run this local establishment since 1928....that says smothering!"}
{"text":"This place has the best food and the nicest servers. We were given extra portions of rice, a small cup of water for my toddler, and extra fortune cookies for the kid. And after, when we were about to leave, Tue server lady packed up all of our food for us. Best Chinese food and best service in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Had business in the court house around the corner and followed some attorneys and judges to this place. A blast from the past to say the least! Tried it several times and have to say was the best thing I found during my 2 weeks spent downtown. First off, this is old school Chinese. The food comes out quick and VERY VERY hot. The Rumaki is fantastic as is the chop suey...a dish long since forgotten in America. The egg rolls are huge and wonderful. Even the sweet and sour dishes altho plain, are perfectly fried and huge pieces of meat inside. This isn't a place for spicy food like Hunan or Schezwan, more basic and somewhat bland but still terrific. Neighborhood somewhat sketchy but has dedicated parking. So when downtown anyway give it a try. If you are into fancy, high visibility, and atmosphere means more than quality of food then this isn't your place. Otherwise check it out...you don't stay in business for decades if you put out bad food! Enjoy..."}
{"text":"So we somehow thought it was a good idea to use a $25 Restaurant.com gift certificate here for just two of us, neglecting to realize we need to spend $35 to use the coupon. That is a whole lot of Chinese food for two people. 

Nevertheless, our waitress was pleasant and cracking up as we tried to figure out how many things we needed to order. We ended up with loads of food that lasted for several days as leftovers. It was all really good and generous portions.

I have no idea how I worked downtown for years and never stumbled upon this place, but I'm thinking they must have a huge lunch crew because the restaurant is enormous and has been around for quite a while (I think).

If you're in the area I'd definitely say check it out. It's kinda quirky but a cool place to try with great grub."}
{"text":"Food was as expected for Chinese food and I especially liked the atmosphere. Relaxed and old school Chinese. Great value for the amount of food served."}
{"text":"You'll either love this place, or hate it.  I must say, this was the worst Chinese food I've had since eating at some place in Gallup, New Mexico back in 1994!  Actually that place was the absolute worst.    BUT, I'm sure there are some tasty dishes this place must have because they were very busy during Monday lunch.  

When you walk in this place, the first thing you'll notice is the smell of grease.  Then you look around, and the atmosphere is dark, drab, and plastic.  There is no ambiance.   Then while you are being attended to, you'll find the staff not very friendly, the none really want to be there.   And last, but not least, you'll wonder why you ordered the food you did.  

I got the egg foo young.  Now some of you are wondering, how can I criticize a Chinese restaurant, when I'm not even ordering real Chinese food!  All I can say is, you might be right.  But really, this dish is so easy to get right, that I'm amazed at how much they got it wrong!   The egg patties were drowning in a totally flavorless brown sauce.   Plus they were slightly burned to a crisp, so essentially you were eating deep fried charcoal in a tasteless gravy.   Oh, and you get a golf ball sized dish of mediocre rice too.  

Like I said, I've heard some people love this place.  I don't know why.  But I do have an idea why this place is still in business.  Location, location, location!  Yes, it is centrally located to the DUI Court and Grand Jury building right next door.   That means tons of new people walk past this establishment on a daily basis.   Then there is the towering monstrosities of Maricopa Country judicial pride just around the corner where hundreds of people work, plead, or visit for jury duty.  And where is the ONLY Chinese Restaurant within any walking distance?  You got it, Sing High!  

My advice, don't go here for the food.  And don't go here for the historical significance.   It's not worth it.   Save that craving for Chinese food for something better.  Heck, even Panda Express would do."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience for this Arizona landmark. Lousy food, poor service and got the bill wrong and argued about it."}
{"text":"If you want good Chinese food without paying an arm and a leg... Come here!! I love the egg rolls, they make them how I remember them on the east coast! Most egg rolls here in Arizona taste like those frozen egg rolls my hubby and I love this place, we even go there for date night!!"}
{"text":"Well had a \"Sing High\" craving; so got the Chicken Chow Mein (Cantonese Style); but discovered 2 new favorites - the Spare Ribs with Black Beans; and the Chinese Green Soup; now wish the soup; was like Seaweed Soup or what we call - Funeral Soup; because we used to head to the Chinese restaurants after the funerals; but this soup is close without the nori or the water chestnuts...Love this place will always love it..."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. My only complaint is that they've hired an elderly homeless man that harasses customers as soon as they park. He claims to work the lot yet has no uniform, and knocks on your window demanding to know what business you have. The manager was polite about the issue, and his intentions are good. However, using a belligerent homeless man to harass and scare off customers is bad business. Plenty of other restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"In Short: Awful food with no imagination, go at your own peril.

I was in downtown Phoenix and it was pretty late so decided to drop by this place.  Looked OK from the outside but I should have walked out as soon as I walked in.  The place was adorned by eclectic collection of 60's, 70's and 80's lefotovers.  The atmosphere from the start was dead wrong.  Hardly any of the staff spoke english, which made ordering an interesting adventure in it self.  

The menu is also a collection of 60's, 70's and 80's leftovers ans typical chinese dishes.  Which in my opinion is Ok if the food was any good, unfortunately that was not the case.  We ordered a soup, a appetizer, and two main dishes (kung pao chicken, and spicy beef).  Soup was decent but the appetizer was over cooked and soaked with oil, then plastered with a thick sauce to make up for it.  Spicy beef was overcooked and unappetizing as well, I suspected the meat was a little old as well.  The real kicker was the cungpao chicken, my friend noticed a piece of rotten vegetable on our dish.  We brought this to the attention of our waitress who took the dish to show to another staff member and then came back and said there was nothing wrong with it and it was a water chestnut.  She took over 10 minues to explain this but for the life of me I couldn't understand her.  They really didn't give us an option to replace the dish, get a new one or even refund the money.  I have no idea if it was a rotten or actually a chestnut but they could have at least offered us a compromise.  Customer service was pretty much zero.  I eat a lot of chinese food and I was really disappointed with the oldest chinese restaurant in phoenix."}
{"text":"If you are hungry this place is going to fix that.  Hugh piles of food that is bound to make you lose your appetite.  Cartoon versions of American style Chinese food but completely devoid of any color.  Skip this place and to Wong's instead.  Same style of food but with flavor and better prices. Sing High does have a better looking dining room.  Wong's looks scary."}
{"text":"WHY can't we give it half or no stars?! I've past this place so many times, and thought today I would taste of piece of history....(since it's been around for over 80 years). Perhaps it should have died by now? IDK I can see how it may have been a thriving place thirty years ago, but today....Saturday night, it was dead. Only people that don't want to be seen go there. 
Food: was all extremely salty. (MSG?) Service: slow. Suggest to anyone? Ahhhhh....NOPE."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has so many bad reviews!  Sing High has definately been there for a long time and it's for a reason.  If they didn't do any business, they would be out of business.  I have been there on days when it's not as good as other times but I guess it depends on who's cooking.  They have the best and biggest egg rolls I have ever seen!  The egg foo young is really good and the pork fried rice is excellent.  I have never walked out of there saying \"that was terrible\"."}
{"text":"Just average food here, egg foo young a disappointment, sweek and sour pork too much breading not enough meat, fried rice bland and nothing to rave about. Asked if we wanted hot tea, one container of tea, six small tea cups, charged each person $1.50 for the tea, REALLY???  $9.00 TOTAL COST for one tea pot of tea, rip off."}
{"text":"Terrible. Got order wrong, service was rude and unapologetic, doing the service industry right :)"}
{"text":"We come here for the Chop Suey! I get the Beef Chop Suey and they are the only place in town that makes it like this. The Egg Rolls are unique and very good as well as the Egg Drop soup. Excellent!"}
{"text":"Service was so slow it almost didn't happen. After about 45 minutes wait, our order came incomplete which took the waitress another 10 minutes to grab the rice that came with our dishes and 2 forks. When we were sat down in the beginning, we asked for a high chair. Didn't get it until our son grabbed the bowl of hot soup placed too close to him and then I finally asked someone else to get the high chair for us. The green soup is delicious but our 2 other orders were taken home to be fed to our dogs. The shrimp with Chinese peas and Hong Kong steak. Terrible. Over salted and lacked any other taste to it than that. Hong Kong steak looked like a patty from a frozen meal at the grocery store. There were a lot of other families there but it wasn't full. Would hate to see how service is when it's full. All in all in my opinion it's not worth the hour or the $30."}
{"text":"The only thing worse than the food there, is the service.  It's almost a joke how poor this place is"}
{"text":"The food is wonderful the best in Phoenix.  Large portions and great taste."}
{"text":"I've been eating here since I was a kid. It is definitely a Phoenix staple. The food has gotten better recently. They hosted a fantastic dinner party for my family and It was reasonably priced. The decor is simple, but the food is always great! My favorites are the fried shrimp, shrimp fried rice, and sweet and sour chicken."}
{"text":"I was so pumped to check this place out after I found it by complete accident. I read up on it and was really intrigued by the history behind the place and how this might be one of the oldest restaurants in Phoenix (they must be doing something right, yeah?) as well as being the only thing standing from the city's historic Chinatown. But, seriously, this place did not live up to anything to any of my expectations.

Now I know some might argue that this place serves American Chinese cuisine, and that's true. However, this is some of the nastiest Chinese food I've ever had. Some might complain about the decor, but I actually kinda liked it. I felt like I was in a Jarmusch movie so I'll give the place some points for that. As much as I'm into dives, this is a little bit higher than a place I ate called Won Kok which I am convinced is the butthole of Los Angeles' Chinatown. To be honest, all I that had at Sing High was the chow mein and the wonton soup. The wonton soup was just old cabbage boiled in water and the chow mein was just a plate of oily noodles. Needless to say, I felt like I was giving birth to the Antichrist a few hours later.

Go to Sing High for the experience of saying you were there, but keep your mouth closed at all costs."}
{"text":"This was by far my worst dining experience ever in downtown Phoenix.  First of all, they got my order wrong (gave me pork instead of chicken).  The staff was also very rude and the food was extremely greasy!  This was my first and last visit to this establishment."}
{"text":"I eat here when visiting friends and family during the week days. It's not particularly spectacular, and my wife prefers that we eat elsewhere.

However, I have a set menu that I always eat when coming to this place, and nearly every server that works there knows what it is, since I always order the same thing, and rarely venture out into the nether regions of their menu.

I order the Sing High Crispy Chicken, the Lo Mein Special, and the Sing High Fried Rice.

The Crispy Chicken, in my opinion, is the only one in town left that does it right and cooks it in this manner. There was one other place that used to cook it in a similar fashion, but that restaurant has long since closed and its owners have retired.

The rest of what I order are just accoutrements to the chicken.

The interior decor hasn't changed much, but the service has always been prompt and efficient. If you happen to be in downtown phoenix, and want some place to eat near the courthouse, you may want to give this place a try."}
{"text":"I don't usually write bad reviews, but this was perhaps the worst chinese food I've ever eaten.  I wanted to LOVE this place, as it's 4 blocks from my loft downtown... so I had dreams of this being a weekly dining spot I walked to with friends and family.  I don't even have high standards... I love hole in the wall chinese food restaurants.  

We ate Saturday night, and used a restaurant dot com coupon.  Ordered a ton of food, so tried lots of dishes.  The only really edible thing was the moo shoo port (spelling?).  That was about 6/10.

The rest was terrible.  I mean, mystery meat.  Made the McDonalds McRib look like Filet Mignon.  We ordered hong kong beef, one of their specialties... it was inedible gristly meat with Hines51 sauce or some other steak sauce poured over it... not asian at all.

I am so disappointed...  I will never return.  Even with the certificate, it was an evening and $40 final bill completely wasted.  

If you do get forced to go here, do not get anything other than shrimp... I shudder at the quality of the other meat, just thinking about it days later."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place yesterday all I  will say is this is the first place I ever walked out of leaving all the food never ate it. Did a taste test got up from the table and left."}
{"text":"this place is the best.. Best pork fried rice in town and also the best won-ton soup you gotta try it"}
{"text":"Real Chinese food!!!! Excellent and good service and  .  Good price compared to other downtown phx eateries.  Chow mein is how my  old chinese relatives made it decades ago."}
{"text":"From what I hear, this is the oldest continually operating restaurant in Phoenix, and is also the last remnant of Chinatown.  The place is old and run down, parking is a pain, and it's tough to get to sometimes because of what seems like never-ending construction and road work.

But...the food is outstanding!  I am eating my way through the menu, and everything I have tried is fantastic and hot and fresh.  It's Cantonese, so a bit different than some folks may be used to unless they came here from a city with a big Chinese population.  The service is great too!"}
{"text":"Not What I Remembered 

It's been a long time since I've eaten at Sing High.  I use to visit Sing High often however, my last few lunch expeirences have not been positive.    

Today, I decided to stop by Sing High for a quick bite to eat.  I was asked if I wanted a booth or table. Since this was going to be a working lunch I asked for a booth.  The server was initially going to sit me by a large group of people.  Normally, I wouldn't ask for a different booth but the restaurant  was empty.  So I asked the server for a diffrent both and it was obvious he was annoyed at my request but allowed me to switch booths.

I ordered  the lunch special which  consisted of sweet & sour shrimp, egg foo young, chicken chow mein, and rice.  The service was fast, however the food was just fair, so don't expect too much. The rice was very sticky and lacked flavor. The sweet and sour shrimp dripped of oil, the chicken chow mein had almost no chicken at all, and the egg foo young just wasn't good.

I'm not sure if this will be my last visit, but it will be my last visit for a while.  Sing High is just not what I remembered."}
{"text":"Terrible food . Omg I couldn't tell the chow mein apart from the chop suey. They both looked grey. Chow mein had no noodles just bean sprouts and the chop suey had no vegetables just bean sprouts . The food was really bad . Not at all edible. The service was satisfactory.. definitely won't go there again."}
{"text":"I love old school Chinese food and so I had really high hopes for this place.  They have been in business for a very long time, since 1928 in fact,  and you would think there must be a good reason for the longevity.  

We may have ordered the wrong things but what we tried was just so-so.  We tried the Chop Suey of course and I am not sure what it was, but it had a strange flavor.  Also tried the Barbecued pork slices and they might have been good a week earlier, but the dish did not taste fresh.  We ordered an egg roll and it too had an odd flavor.  

 The good news is that they have parking, which is hard to find in that neighborhood."}
{"text":"It is a SIN that Sing High hasn't been reviewed until now. On behalf of all long-time Phoenicians, new-comers, I ask for your forgiveness. 

Sing High is a simple Chinese restaurant that has been in downtown Phoenix since 1927. Yeah. Read that again. You're still on Yelp's *Phoenix* page, where the only things still enduring from 1927 are our retirees in Scottsdale. While Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig were demolishing the American League and Calvin Coolidge was in the White House, Fred (Yuk Cheung) Lee was instructing an Anglo sign-painter to write \"Shanghai Chop Suey House\" on his restaurant at 2nd Street and Madison. Mr Lee spoke no English and couldn't read it, and the painter apparently didn't take geography at what was then the Tempe Normal School (ASU). So what ended up on the sign was \"Sing High\" instead of \"Shanghai\". 

Sing High is not at its original 1927 location. It moved in 1981, about a hundred yards so cut it some slack. Fred's grandson, Harlan Lee, is an ASU MBA graduate but he carries on the amazing family tradition behind this restaurant. 

The food is perhaps not the kind that would blow your mind. But it is solidly good Chinese food (and fyi: you don't do business for 80 years by making mediocre food). There are a million different choices. The portions are huge and you will likely over-eat. The atmosphere and vibe of the restaurant are largely irrelevant to me. They're good, you sense the history when you walk in, but they're not trying to razzle-dazzle you with anything. There are old pictures of old Phoenix tacked on to walls. A 1970s print of the Great Wall of China. A random 1980s photo of Manhattan. That sort of thing. The service is what it is. Good. Friendly owners. Maybe you'll wait a little longer for take-out now and then because they're not totally organized. It's ok. Take a deep breath and wander around the lobby looking at the walls. Remember that whatever you're thinking about as you wait for your food, judges and lawyers and cops from the near-by superior court have thought the exact same thing as they waited for their Sing High serving, in 1930, 1940, 1950... 

Every single judge who sat on the bench in Maricopa County has eaten here, in almost the entire history of our state (born in 1914), because even our old territorial courthouse on Central and Washington is a 60 second stroll away. Sandra Day O'Connor, I guarantee you, has eaten here. 

I come here often--I can walk from my loft--with a sense of pride that Sing High has survived as long as it has in this city that barely existed until decades ago. As soon as I hit \"Post It\" on this review, I'm picking up the phone to call in an order to pick up on my way home."}
{"text":"My family and I went here for lunch yesterday 08-25-17 for a party of 12. This was our first time trying it. Aaaandd I don't think we will ever coming back again. My sister ordered the sing high fried rice and almost everybody ordered the combinations. I ordered the combo number 4 with chowmein. Fyi, those aren't even close to be a CHOW MEIN. Chow mein is noodles it aint a BEAN SPROUTS. Sweet and sour pork is supposed to have pineapple and sweet red bell peppers not just a sauce. My biggest concern was when my sister ordered her SING HIGH fried rice there was a BUG.! Yes a Bug! We then called one of the server to confirm it and said yes it was a bug because they had the pest  control that day. That means that bug had chemicals on it, everybody got disgusted that we almost didn't even touch and eat our food. Aaaand the food was damn expensive and it looks disgusting that all the food were just put in one small plate."}
{"text":"Tried them out for the first time last night and the food was phenomenal. The service was great. I ordered the chicken and broccoli special and we had the potstickers and eggrolls. I'll definitely come back here again! Best Chinese I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"I love this place. The combo plates are huge and reasonably priced. The egg rolls are huge and moist, and the chow mein is the best. The wait staff is really nice, and the feel is like sitting at mom's kitchen table. Not fancy, just really good food."}
{"text":"I hate to do this but My last visit here was horrible which was 45 min ago! Thats how bad it was that i had to yelp it right away... Food was like normal ive been going there for years now. But the service was horrible!!! Not once did we get ask for refills and i drink water like crazy! I asked for the manager and we talked but she seem to be so defenseive lke the owners on Hells Kitchen I couldnt believe it... = [ i hope this service changes around."}
{"text":"This place stays alive becase there are hungry jurors trapped in the basement of the grand jury room who need food.  The carpet hasn't been cleaned since probably the Nixon era.  And the food is pretty standard.  That said, everyone has to go there at least once so that they say they have a) survived it b) been there c) surprisingly crave it.  Most people pick a, but some surprisingly pick c.  It's an old-school Phoenix thing and you have to support that!"}
{"text":"So I was sitting in my office today minding my own business after a very long and tense meeting when a very high up person in the organization I work in walks in and invites me to lunch with two other people from the office. He's not the kind of guy you say no to even if you have already ate some lunch, which I had. So I agreed to go, which is how I ended up at Sing High, as it is the favorite DT lunch destination of the person who invited me to lunch.  What an interesting place.

It looks like a converted warehouse; it's rather large, open and bright with a few posts scattered about. Decor is simple and understated. The menu has all of your standards, and while not as large as Gourmet House of Hong Kong (thankfully), it is still a good size.  Prices are incredibly moderate and I believe for the four of us the bill came to around $34 (does not include tip).  I had the chicken with almond dish, which was rather large especially as I had already ate! Unfortunately the side of rice is not very large and there were definitely some pieces of chicken that I was afraid to eat.  The sweet and sour pork got raves from one of my dining companions.

We placed our order quickly but then it took a very long time for our food to come out even though we arrived well after the lunch hour. If you are looking for a \"quick\" (can be in and out in around an hour give or take ten minutes), then skip Sing High and wait when you can enjoy a more leisurely dining experience. We were there for about 90 minutes, with most of the time spent waiting for the food. The most interesting part of the trip to Sing High was that apparently you can slip a guy a few dollars in the parking lot to watch your car for you if you were to be so inclined."}
{"text":"My family has been going to Sing High for years. We enjoy the food & service.  We order the Happy Family, Pork fried rice, pan fried noodles, won ton soup, pork egg foo young, dumplings, and $6 chicken. We share family style and order the same things each time. We find in consistently delicious. Sing High will forever be a family tradition."}
{"text":"You've been warned. See my review about The Prime.
A lifetime Phoenician recommended we go here due to it being \"the best chinese food in town\".

We went for lunch. A quaint place. Busy. Lots of families. Bright. 
We were a party of four and were greeted and seated promptly.

Three of the party ordered the Sing High special noodles, I ordered something different, shrimp with chinese pea pods. The water chestnuts were rotten. Literally rotten. I picked them out but quickly lost my will to forge on. The shrimp, I think there were three, were ok. So I had some of my gf's dish. It was ok, while our host was simply raving I was a bit incredulous. 
THIS is the best chinese food in town.....? Ewwwww!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in with a party of 6 or 7 during a weekday lunch hour.

It looked promising. It was awful. Everyone was unhappy with their dish. The egg rolls were filled with greasy nasty cabbage. Worst egg roll I've ever had. 

Peppered steak dish was soggy chewy mystery beef. Poo poo platter was over fried greasy items. Bacon wrapped something that was essentially semi dried dog food. 

My wife did like the egg drop soup. She loved that it had mushrooms and extra veggies. 

Never again for me though."}
{"text":"This is a place that is owned by some friends of my extended family. That being said, this is only the second time coming here in my life. I think that there is some perception out there that real Chinese food is Panda Express or some form of that. Let me tell you, this is real Chinese food. It is not overy sugary or sweet and tastes just like authentic Chinese food should. They have a pretty decent sized menu and many different options. My family got the chicken fried rice (amazing), lemon chicken (pretty good) and a combo of pork chow Mein, pork egg roll and sweet and sour chicken (all great). The portion sizes were huge and we had left overs for days. I would definitely recommend this place for good Chinese food if you are downtown."}
{"text":"I FINALLY had a chance to try this place out after hunting for delivery Chinese food all day on Sunday without any success -- typical Phoenix -- the one place my gf and I found was actually CLOSED on Sundays.  Weak.

Anyway, this place was worth getting out of the house for on a rainy Sunday, and since its only a few blocks from our place, it was a nice excursion.

We ordered the Beef & Broccoli, the Kung Pao Vegetables, the Sweet & Sour Pork, Crab Puffs, and all of that came with rice.  The total was about $30.  Not a bad value considering we ended up eating that as two meals between two people.  Chinese food is good that way.

So, the quality was average-to-slightly-above-average.  It hit the spot as hangover food, and i have to say that the Kung Pao Veggies were DELICIOUS as they were diced up and mixed with almonds.  Yum.

The Beef and Broc was pretty standard, but really, thats all i ask of that dish.  Its pretty undemanding and it does the job.  They did hold out on any extra beef though -- i thought more would have improved the dish. 

The Sweet and Sour pork was pretty below average, as their fried dough was too thick and the quality of pork was below par.  

Crab puffs were solid and my dog destroyed the steamed rice i put in her bowl, so in her opinion that rice was quality.

Overall, i like how its a local institution, convenient (i ordered, picked up, and was eating in under 30 mins), their packaging was nice, and the service was class.  

I'll look here next time dining Chinese in DT."}
{"text":"Just as American as apple pie is Americanized Chinese food. This place is a great hole in the wall. Bad decorating, excellent service, sweet and sour sauce: master of contrasts. I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"I used to love the food here. I don't know what happened! IT WAS DISGUSTING! Took forever to get the nasty ass food. Then I couldn't eat anything! House fried rice was gritty and bean sprouts in it didn't taste like they washed them. Then the sweet and sour pork was thick pieces of pork fat dipped in some thick hard batter on the outside raw on the in side. Lo mein noodles slimey with more dirty bean sprouts than noodles. How do you mess up fried chicken wings?!! Same nasty batter on them as well! Chicken tasted almost raw! I will never go back. I refused to pay for any of my food! So disappointed. I told my friend how great they were only to be proven to be a lie!"}
{"text":"A lot of the previous reviewers have talked about how downhill this place has gotten over the years. And to be honest I would have to agree with many of them. However the thing that keeps me coming back to this place is the pan fried noodles. They are my go to meal whenever I am craving carbohydrates and don't care about eating healthy at all. You can get them with the chow mein and they call it Cantonese style however I like just ordering a side of them and dousing them with soy sauce. On this last visit I found out that they get these specially made for them. That would explain why I have tried ordering panfried noodles at so many other Asian places and have never been able to get them replicated. Now that I no longer work way downtown anymore I don't get there as often as I would like to. However I do make it a point to get there at least a few times a year just to satisfy my craving!"}
{"text":"I have with each visit become more disappointed with the food and upkeep of this restaurant. The decor hasn't been changed as far as I can remember and the table cloths and seats are worn. The food used to be of good quality but now it's cold, soggy, wilted vegetables and over breaded shrimp or pork. 
Someone please put this place out of its misery."}
{"text":"The food at this place is very good. They have a lot to choose from and their chop suey is very good. Their egg rolls have a strong ginger taste. Very good food all in all."}
{"text":"Ordered a suggested combo that had egg foo young, chow mein, and sweet and sour pork. It was a good amount of good food for a decent price.  And whenever I eat Chinese I have to order the crab and cheese wontons, its my addiction.  Good quantity compared to other places (10 pieces).  I wish they had a little more filling, but that is my usual wish when I order wontons at most places.  My friend ordered the Bean Cake with Beef, which was also good.  Solid place to grab lunch in downtown Phoenix.  The restaurant/building does show its age compared to all the new places downtown.   I rounded up for the 4 star rating, its was better than okay, but would have to try again to be a fan."}
{"text":"The place is pretty HUGE. The decor is a little grungy looking...almost like the 70s type decoration. It felt like it was missing that big brown box tv that sits on the ground? They seated us quickly and the waitress was nice and attentive, continually walking around refilling wate and tea glasses.

I ordered the Moo Goo Gai Pan, when the order finally came, becuase yes it was busy so it took awhile, but it was yummy! It was like chicken soup without the soup. A comfort chinese food when sick? I think so! I've been having this spicy craving lately, they didn't have much in that area, maybe one dish per meat option. :( But they did have pepper and chili flakes that I made use of. Just be aware that the chili flakes...when sprinkling, the fumes will attack. lol Lean back a bit when shaking that bad boy.

My coworker got the sweet and sour chicken, which I promptly ask for a bite, lol, yes I am that person. If you say no, thats okay but I will ask and definently offer a bite of mine. :) The pieces were HUGE, so I just cut one in half, because I did just want a taste. The fried batter was delicious, it reminded me of the fair food, all the fried goodness.

My other two coworkers got the special, Kung Pao Beef. It was a huge helping with a lot of sprouts, I mean a lot. They said it was perfectly spicy and crunchy. 

I saw people ordering the combination around us, and that will be something I will be trying. It came with a huge egg roll and I thought it would be like the other places I've been so I ordered one. No such luck. It was filled with cabbage and sprouts, thats it. It was good, but not great. 

Would I be back? If I have training again and craving chinese food? Sure. But there's Thai  closer and I loooove Thai, so we'll see. Total cost of tea, meal and egg roll: $13.13."}
{"text":"YES, this place has been around forever, though it isn't that great so I'm not sure why.  There are plenty of other cheap (and better) options in the area.

I used to come here for takeout quite a bit a few years back and remember it being better; not sure what happened.  I went today and it was definitely below average.  

The House Fried Rice is really the only thing I've ever eaten here that was legitimately good.  Everything else is utility."}
{"text":"Love love this place.  The only place that I get chopped suey that I like.  Been in business for a long time serving great food."}
{"text":"2/5 standard chinese.

i'll start off by saying it was my fault for getting chinese in phoenix. but a senior in my office was heading there, so of course i had to go. the food is standard chinese/cornstarch fare, though i'm sure there is a saving chef's specialty dish."}
{"text":"Took mom out to lunch and told her to pick some place downtown we've never been before. She chose this one based on the history. After reading some of the reviews here, I was a bit apprehensive but decided to give it a go anyway as I was interested in the history of the place as well.

I'm not sure what everyone was complaining about now. Sure, it's not fancy or modernized but it was clean, we were seated and served quickly, and it filled both of us up for under $20. I got the combo No. 4 platter with chow mein, fried rice, sweet and sour pork and an eggroll. The plate was full and I wasn't able to finish! The eggroll was a little too ginger-y but was large and tasty and the pork and chow mein were both really good and fresh. The fried rice was a bit plainer than I'm used to (no veggies or egg) but was still tasty. Mom got the pork lo mein and the plate was heaping - she also couldn't finish.
8 hours later and I feel great, if a little sad I didn't take some of the leftovers home. No ill effects like some reviews below stated.

I suppose if you go to a restaurant for a specific atmosphere, you're going to leave dissatisfied even with good food. However, I could care less about that - I'm at a restaurant to eat, not stare at the walls around me. This place is definitely worth it if you want some fast and cheap Chinese food downtown."}
{"text":"This place has been around forever!  Food is ok, service is ok.  Atmosphere is plain, simple and almost retro.  LOL   Give it a try."}
{"text":"I stopped today to pick up some take out since I like their won ton soup. The service was terrible - the person at the counter was rude and acted as though my presence was a major inconvenience. I ordered a quart of the won ton soup and the Sa-Te Beef and paid $14.xx for the order. When I saw what they gave me my reaction was \"you've got to be kidding me!\" The Sa-Te Beef was in the container that normally contains the rice....and the rice was in an 8 oz. styrofoam coffee cup. Incredible! 

There are much, much, much better Chinese food restaurants around Phoenix that have delicous food, good prices and great service to settle for Sing High.

I gave it two stars only because of the soup."}
{"text":"We were surprisingly segregated from the other patrons due to our race by an elderly Chinese lady. She grunted and motioned to the hostess to seat us in a separate uninviting dining area (she really did grunt). There was plenty of room in the dining area with the other patrons. And the hostess had a look of shock on her face as well. 
This was an obvious and clear unmitigated act of blatant discrimination. My family was disrespected and mistreated, which was totally uncalled for! This is an inexcusable act regardless of race, age, gender or type of restaurant! We have never been so insulted and left immediately! 
As far as businesses go, customers are your LIVLIHOOD! You don't mistreat your customers if you want to retain their business! Despite some of the bad reviews, we gave this establishment an impartial chance...BIG MISTAKE! I for one will never return to Sing High and will never recommend them to anyone. If possible, I would award this place negative stars...."}
{"text":"I really like this place, however I usually get take out. They are friendly - if I have a special request they accommodate me. I work in the City Scape Plaza and usually go to Sigh High about twice a month.
Portions are large and tasty. I do agree that sometimes the egg rolls are greasy, but over all most things on the menu are great."}
{"text":"I had been craving a good egg roll. So while downtown on business I dropped in and ordered some egg foo young and an egg roll. 

Wow, what a disappointment. The egg foo young was just ok. 

The egg roll was the worst I ever had. It was large  and filled with some type of mystery filling. I opened up and could not eat it. The man behind me sent his back.
 I was short on time so I just left my money and walked out. Never to return again.

I sure do not know what has happened to the old establishment.  I had heard it was a real classic for Chinese food. It may have been years ago. But not on the day I was there."}
{"text":"Tucked away behind historic buildings and located a couple hundred feet from the sight of the original Phoenix China town stands a local restaurant that has been part of the city since the 1920s. For that reason, I think everyone should try this place at least once. 

The place was hopin' on a Saturday afternoon when I was there. The windowless building is a little cave like, with harsh soft light hanging from the ceiling. It resembled most Americanized Chinese food places: Asian art on the wall, old booths, plastic table cloths. 

I don't agree with some of other Yelp reviews that the food was so bad. It was pretty average. I like lemon chicken and get that pretty much anywhere I go, so I tried it here. I wasn't blown away, but it wasn't terrible. The fried rice left the same impression. 

But they were friendly to me and kept my glass of water full. 

I want to go back and try the name sake Chop Suey. Maybe that's where they excel. Any place that can survive in downtown Phoenix for this many decades deserves some respect."}
{"text":"If you can't get beef and broccoli right, shut down...quit...go home...stop.
Luckily, they got it right.  
Don't have time to read about the 'history' of this place, but I guess they've been around awhile.  I see why. 
Big portions.
Safe dishes with tastes that satisfy enough without going all out.
My beef and broccoli had a nice sauce, not what I'm used to at my neighborhood place, but quite flavorful without being anything fancy.  It's something you could eat anytime you're hungry...like a good song that you let play whether you're in the mood for music or not.  Its not that you LOVE the song, it just settles nicely in your ears whenever its on.  The sauce, the big fresh broccoli, and the tender and nicely seasoned beef settles nicely on your tongue.  Like an old friend to your taste buds.
My second time I tried the curry chicken.  Curry chicken is one of my favorite dishes.  I'm probably a green rookie when it comes to good curry chicken, having only experienced a few places' offerings.  But Sing High's is the second best I've had.  Again, nothing fancy.  No awards from foodies will be won.  But from this guy (foodie rookie i guess), tis' awesome.  The sauce isn't too thin and is extremely flavorful.  It smelled up the whole office.  And that's all.  Chicken, onions, peppers, sauce.  And it was the best meal i'd had in some time.
Price was right on both dishes...around 8 or 9 bucks.  
This is non-complicated, non-frilly food that you can get quick for a nice price.  Perfect for lunch.
The decor...its just whatever.  Not a place to admire the walls.  There were plenty people dining in, and they seemed to have adequate accommodations.  I didn't see bugs, dirty stuff, etc.
The staff was busy and it showed.  Not unpleasant, but not taking the time to be all smiley and such, either.  I got my food, so I didn't really care.
Perhaps they could improve on their waiting area - too many people standing around not knowing if the other was in line or just waiting.  Small gripe.
They are in the rotation now, and i'm sure they will earn more stars as I go down their menu.  Speaking of the menu, there are no prices.  I see a lot of that downtown now...oh well.  Like i said, an order of beef and broc was like 8-9 dollars.  
One negative thing about something I had - the Drums of Heaven.  Horrible.  Just a bunch of non-seasoned batter on under cook drums.  Didn't even finish them.
So yeah, you're not looking to spend a lot, you're looking to get full, you're looking for something that tastes pretty good, and you're downtown?  Go here, i'm sure they have one of your basic favorites."}
{"text":"Try the Beef Curry. Excellent. I was really shocked.  Havent eaten that good in long time"}
{"text":"We stopped in on Friday night before the baseball game.  We ordered the hot and sour soup which was really good but once we receive our other dishes it went down hill from there.  We ordered the Moo Goo Gai Chicken and the Beef chow mein (hard noodles from a box) and a veggie dish. Everything had a weird taste to it,  like from a can and not fresh.  Our daughter was upset that the chow mein ended up being different than what most Chinese restaurants servers.   I had to go to the bathroom twice once the food started to be processed. 
We will not be returning here."}
{"text":"I live and work downtown.   This place is always on point... family owned.   Hot and Sour soup is amazing"}
{"text":"We were so happy to have our old Sing High back when we stopped in for dinner today.  The food quality has returned and the service is back to what we once knew!  It wasn't very busy for Easter Sunday so I hope their prior issues haven't impacted them permanently. We do love Sing High.  The decor still needs a makeover but we will be frequenting more often if they maintain the level of quality we experienced today!"}
{"text":"I'm on Jury duty and when I saw this old Phoenix landmark, I thought, great.   What a huge disappointment.  I had the number 2 special which included chop suey which was 99% bean sprouts, egg roll- again 99% bean sprouts, 2 fried shrimp- 99% breading and fried rice which was ok.
On the plus side, the service and server were prompt and pleasant."}
{"text":"This was the 8th and last stop on our dine around for today. 

We had super high hopes for sing high, and I was a little underwhelmed, but it was a pleasant experience. We came in about 15minutes before the end of the event, and sat ourselves in what looked to be the main dining area. Our server was super sweet, and asked us how our day was going and about the other places we hit up that afternoon. I had the orange chicken and the egg rolls and Jon had the wontons. 

We received a pot of hot tea and sipped on that while we waited on our food. It came out and it was a TON of food for the few bucks we were paying for it. Started with the egg roll which, in few words, was weird. It was just stuffed with meat and had no noticeable seasoning at all. I took a few bites and was done. The orange chicken was pretty tasty. It was a lot so I ate about half and grabbed a box to go. I can't say that I'd be back, as I've had better Chinese food closer to home, but the service is what made me round this place up to 3 stars."}
{"text":"I didnt really care for it, the chop suey was gray and tasted like nothing and the egg roll was a really wierd fried lump of I dont know what. Everyone in my office loves it and they said order the sweet and sour. I liked how they had a guard in the parking lot since its in a wierd sketchy part of funktown."}
{"text":"Is Sing High Closing there current location"}
{"text":"If you get carryout, check your order. Moo shu pork came without it's purpose in life, the sauce, and was a dry and tasteless mess. Will never bother going back. Too many other good options exist."}
{"text":"First time we have ever been here. This place has been  around since the 20's. Why i have never made it here. This is an institution. The history the nostalgia speak for its longevity.
The combos are straight forward. Mounds of food...piles of chow mein.. we tried the egg foo yung served over fried rice. To call it great might be an exaggeration.. it was solidly good. Tasty complimented by the gravy onions and the nothing special fried rice. It all came together and hit the spot. 
The chow mein and crispy noodles were satisfying piled high an ideal mix of mostly bean sprouts and some celery and who cares what else. It was tasty and also hit the spot that i was craving 
The shrimp in tempura were tender flavorful delicious. Not sure how many i really could have eaten but we were full and completely satisfied 
The iced tea was so refreshing we drank a ridiculous amount.  
Try this place for the history and nostalgia.. dont judge the age this isnt your trendy flash in the pan this is an icon. The food service and satisfaction will bring me back. Thanks for hanging in there when other places havent made it!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food. If you want real Chinese food like in China, go somewhere else. This is real Americanized traditional Chinese food. Terrible service. But I keep coming back because of the food. Mmm."}
{"text":"Have been going there since at least 1988.   Good down home Chinese food.  Enjoy it lots."}
{"text":"FIRST--this place does NOT serve authentic Chinese food. If you haven't had the opportunity to try authentic, then you might not know the difference. This is the WORST Chinese food that I have ever had...tasteless and greasy (be sure to bring your Tums or Rolaids).

If you want authentic, then go to the Gourmet House of Hong Kong on 16th St and McDowell (it's a real dive, but very authentic!) or have Dim Sum at the Great Wall at 35th Ave/Camelback (sadly, the Silver Dragon is gone...)

You'd be better off eating at Panda Express."}
{"text":"I've loved this place for years.  It's typical of chop suey houses in other major cities; authentic, perhaps short on style but absolutely outstanding food.  Great people."}
{"text":"I'm not one to complain when I receive medicore to bad service.  I have other things to do with my time, but my experience was the worst I'd ever experienced that I felt compelled to sign up for a Yelp account just so I could share my experience.  

I was serving on a jury trial recently when me and 6 of my fellow Jurors thought we'd take the short jaunt from the courthouse to this restaurant.  The decor was beyond dated with an awkwardly placed birdcage in the middle of the room. But who cares as long as its clean and the food is good right? Well it was an epic fail on both accounts.  

Two of my party sent their waters back immediately because of mysterious black things floating on it.  I ordered a shrimp and scallop dish some others ordered the chow mein combo plate.  I get my food and see that its in some weird milky/cloudy sauce with black beans in it.  I take a bite and its awful and tastes sour.  Thinking perhaps its just me I take another bite which is just as awful as the first.  I flagged down the waitress and politely asked her if I may swap out this dish for something else on the menu.  Here's where things get ridiculous.  She raises her eyebrows and demands to know \"well what's wrong with it?\" I told her that something didn't taste right.  She proceeds to give me another menu by throwing it on the table and then throwing her hands up in disgust and stomping off.  

Everyone at the table was stunned into silence.  When she came back to see what else I'd like I told her that I was leaving and I found the food terrible and her customer service even worse.  They proceeded to charge me for the soda I literally took one sip out of just to wash the terrible taste of the food out of my mouth.  

I left my party and had a wonderful lunch experience at Five Guys.  I later was told that two other jurors ended up walking out as well as their chop suey must have been left over from yesterday. 

There are several good options for food around the courthouse.  This is NOT one of them.  Save yourself the gastrointestinal distress and go to one of them."}
{"text":"Serving on Jury Duty, it is close to the Courthouse.  A couple of the gals that I am serving with, came in today.

I ordered Shrimp Kung Pao, without the peanuts, or almonds, and white rice.  It was delicious, spicy as in the description, with lots of shrimps, and vegetables, and I ordered white rice.  My companion ordered the exact same thing, with fried rice.. and the other gal ordered a combination #1, and asked for chicken, instead of pork.  I know she was disappointed with the chicken, as it was all dark meat.

Overall, a good meal, we drank water, had a waitress that looked like she was 80 years old, but was very efficient."}
{"text":"I came here with a fairly large group of friends because a few of our friends had recommended it so highly. Unfortunately it was overwhelmingly disappointing.  We all got a wide variety of things from the menu. I personally had the Cantonese-style chow mein and it simply didn't taste good. It was a bunch of soggy noodles with a weird flavorless gravy on top of it. Normally I don't care about \"authenticity\" at a Chinese restaurant as long as it tastes good but I was left wondering what exactly was \"Cantonese\" about the dish. It's sad to think that some people might associate the fresh flavors of Cantonese cuisine with what I was offered here.

As for everyone else's food, I didn't try it mostly because judging by their faces as they dug in to their food, I could tell their food was as decidedly mediocre and \"meh\" as mine was. Even more telling, a few of them \"accidentally\" forgot their leftovers at the restaurant when we left. 

I had high hopes for the place since it's fairly close to where I live but based on this experience, I'll be hard-pressed to go back."}
{"text":"I love it! The diviest piece of crap hole in the wall, but they make the best food! The sweet and sour pork is actually chopped pork, with a heavy breading and cooked just right. So much better than the standard deep fried pork balls at other places. The egg rolls aren't actually wrapped, but they dip them batter and fry them without any wrapping. The soups are great, and the family dinners which come with soup, egg roll, and entree are a great value. The servers are pretty old chinese women that will not bend for anything... at all. We orderd a meal for two, and then asked to order a third one and she refused, saying they already started cooking it, and we would have to order another meal for two... odd. Also odd, is they have a birdcage with a fake cardinal in the center of the dining room. This is so far the best chinese I have found in Phoenix, a city that should be known for having no good chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Marlee is such a good hostess. I order pick up from this place all the time and she's always getting everything correct and in order. She's super sweet too!! This place is the bomb.com also. The food is sooooo good."}
{"text":"Sing High has three dishes that I think are among the best versions I've ever come across. #1 - Chinese Green Soup. It is full of pork, egg, and greens in a sublime broth! The BOMB! ...#2 Sweet & Sour Pork. Their twist on this dish leaves a piece of pork with a thicker breading than most places. The sauce is mmmmmmmm! ...#3 Their combo Fried Rice (ask for no peas, no carrots) has a smokey taste that others just do not achieve. *** NOTE = The Fried Rice that comes with the combo dishes is not the same as the made to order Fried Rice. Get the made to order version and enjoy FIVE STAR Fried Rice."}
{"text":"Very rude!

Orders my food in advance  and still had to wait and when I asked the big guy in the front he roles his eyes and told me to have a seat and he would call me. 

Food was very bland and lemon chicken was like it was microwaved.

Would never come back."}
{"text":"Um...it was OK.

Was headed to a Suns game with my buddy and he recommended we come here.  It is real close to the arena, he knows the owners, it has been here forever, and I'm always down to try a new spot out.  We parked in the lot, headed inside and browsed the menu.  My buddy always gets a dish (off menu) that consists of noodles, beef and vegetables made Sczechuan style.  It's kind of like a chow mein but with thicker noodles...almost like spaghetti?  Kind of hard to describe.  He says he always orders it and never strays from it.  Figured why not order it myself.  It sounded decent.  I also went with an egg roll.  Here is how everything was.........

Egg Roll-  First of all, these egg rolls were huge!  They were fried pretty well, but just a smidge greasy.  The filling of the egg roll was not that great though.  It consisted mostly of bean sprouts.  It didn't have the usual mix of veggies or pork that most traditional egg rolls have. I ate the whole thing down with some hot mustard and it was just ok. Was it the worst egg roll ever?  No. Would I order one again?  Also, no.  

Beef Noodle Dish- This thing came with a huge pile of noodles with some sauteed beef and veggies throughout.  The noodles has a good consistency, were thick and chewy and were easy to spool around the fork.  They did have a bit of a greasy texture like the egg roll, and you could see the \"sheen\" on the noodles, but they went down fine.  Would I get them again?  Eh...possibly.  They tasted ok but it isn't something I would ever crave.

Service was friendly, and the pricing was fair for the portion you get.  Am I coming back?  By myself, no.  With a group of people that love the place before going to a game downtown?  Maybe.  Wasn't bad, wasn't great.  Just A-OK.  Exactly what 3 stars is."}
{"text":"[Service was quick and courteous = 3 stars....Food = 2......2.5 stars rounded down)

As a downtown dweller I am always supporting the local restaurants and businesses.  Sing High Chop Suey House has always been on the fringes for me and I have only been there once before at a Downtown Phoenix Dine Around event.  I remember it being just ok then (Egg roll was good, sweet and sour chicken tasty). Until today it had just been one of those places that was just ok and just hadn't made much effort to go back. 
This evening I didn't want to cook and had a Suns game to get to later and I was craving an egg roll.  
Oh what the heck...Sing High...let's do this.  

I was looking forward to trying their Chop Suey at a REAL Chop Suey House.  My mind was filled with tastes and textures of fresh veggies, bean sprouts with still a bit of crunch. maybe a little fresh green pepper, celery  as long as it wasn't that canned stuff mom made it had to be better .  I ordered the #2 Dinner Combo (fried shrimp, egg fu young, pork chop suey and rice) and had them add an egg roll.  

I didn't wait long for my food.  

On first look all I saw was thick cornstarch-y sauce...dipped my fork into it hoping the flavor was better...
***BOOM***
I was jolted back to my childhood....

[insert black hole tornado sequence here followed by a flash of lightning]

As a kid my mom would  make us those La Choy Chung King Family Meal (Chicken Chop Suey or Egg Fu Young) Kit.  No matter how well my mom rinsed that can of veggies that came with the kit you could still taste the can.  Oh and all that cornstarch thickened sauce that came with the kit...While we ate the Chicken Chop Suey,  the Egg Fu Young was the house favorite and even with the egg and the sauce you could still taste the tin-y limp veggies.
 
Jolted back to the present by a polite , \"How is your meal?\" 
I smiled politely and nodded.   What I had here on my plate was the same as mom used to make, tin-y limp and bland ...and the egg roll was filled with the same chop suey-ness that was going on in my plate.  The think cornstarch thickened sweet and sour sauce and plenty of  soy made it a bit better.  The 2 fried shrimp were a bit tough but again with sweet and sour sauce it made them ok.   By the time I began to try my egg fu young, knew I was going to need a bit more to make it work.  I motioned for the server and asked if they had chile sauce and she promptly brought me some.  
This redeemed the egg fu young to just ok status  and  I hoped it would do something for the chop suey...it didn't...I picked through about a half cup worth and left the rest there.  

If  I found myself here again, I would pass on the egg roll and the chop suey and stick to something fried like sweet and sour something or some apps. Maybe I will try the soup next time.

[I am not ruling them out completely.]"}
{"text":"Okay so this place isn't fancy and you certainly wouldn't want to come here for the ambience but if you are downtown and looking for some tasty Americanized Chinese food this is the place to be! Sure it is greasy and you will likely walk out of here in a food coma but their lunch specials are huge, tasty and can't be beat. Make sure you order an egg roll- they are super crispy and massive (I swear each one resembles a small burrito in size rather than your standard wimpy egg roll).

Bonus- this place is a downtown staple and has been around forever. I have heard rumors that it used to be a brothel!"}
{"text":"Recently dined at \"Pay High, Taste Low\"... Unfortunately I was confronted with the three infamous S's, Sunday, Seven pm, Suicide! Please don't get me wrong I am not insensitive to suicide but you will not find any place more depressing in the world. The lighting is low and yellow, the floor is dizzying dismal and the bird cage is empty. Even the bird couldn't take it. It's in a pretty low lit level of downtown and if I didn't say I wasn't looking over my shoulder every two steps for a jail break convict to take me hostage, I would be lying. The service was very good and I must say they try hard. But all I could think about is,  will my car be there when I get out of here. I actually checked my wallet for cab cash home. The restaurant could actually be a set for a David Lynch movie.  The food was forgettable-well maybe not,  I ordered three dishes, Chop Suey and that was a glob of an ice cream scoop of flavorless something. It tasted like a celery stick that had been boiled for three hours. Sweet and Sour Shrimp, that was pretty much a fried batter stick absent of shrimp. BBQ pork fried rice, which was delicious and I would highly recommend this dish. I would actually pay a buddy to pick up a quart of this rice for me. Wow 80 years this establishment has been in business. I guess there is a clientele for it? They must be doing something right. The price is moderate and not really inexpensive. Maybe I will give it another try in the daylight this time and definitely not on Sunday at Seven pm."}
{"text":"Almost no chicken in my Kung Pow Chicken.  I wish I could attach a photo to show the whole serving plate is still full after eating all of the chicken.  Special fried rice is good but, again, tiny shrimp & meat pieces.  Would be good if they stopped trying to save money/increase profits by skimping on meat in their dishes."}
{"text":"Where to start?  The decor is sad and old, the food is bland, and expensive for what you get, and the wait staff are polite, but not particularly accommodating.
If you're downtown and you're craving old fashioned, American style, Chop Suey, go here.  If you want anything else at all other than Chop Suey---run away!

Will I go back?  Well, probably not.  Even though they were nice and gave us the paper to read while we waited for our food,  it was a bland and ugly experience. 

 My opinion?

Shut it down long enough to give it a complete make over, including the (shudder) horrible bathroom, and force the cook to create some new dishes.  Everything about this place screams boredom and apathy."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come here forever and got a chance today due to the Dine Around event. My friend and I ordered everything on the event menu: fried pork wontons with egg drop soup, egg rolls stuffed with cabbage and BBQ pork, and orange chicken. The meals came with tea, too. 

Due to the event, we were seated in a side room. It was very drab and badly need of updating. The cement floors were cracked and the bathrooms were scary. The waitress was nice but neglected to ask us what we wanted to drink. When she brought the food, we had to ask for water. Also despite knowing we were sharing, she didn't bring us any extra plates. Annoying. One thing I forgot to add was when we first got there, we stood waiting in the lobby trying to figure out how to be seated. There was a sign with an arrow to the dining room on the right for the event, but it didn't specify to seat yourself. After seeing several employees at the register not ackowledge us, I finally asked what we should do. Then she told us to seat ourselves. 

The food was good. I especially liked the egg rolls and orange chicken. The orange chicken was actually delicious. Although I liked the food. it wouldn't be enough to bring me back. The atmosphere and service, from beginning to end, left much to be desired. Food simply isn't enough to bring me back to a place if service is bad."}
{"text":"I've had their food in the past, never really stood out as great but it's the only Chinese food by my place of work. I order their Chicken Green Beans with Black bean sauce. Wasn't awful, but I've had better at other restaurants. Not only is the quality or quantity worth the price tag at all, but later that night and all throughout the next day I had food poisoning. My boyfriend had their Mongolian beef and suffered the same thing. Maybe it was a freak incident, maybe not. Either way, I won't be going here again. There's plenty of other Chinese food restaurants that deserve your appetite's attention. Hell, even Panda Express is better than this garbage.
Don't waste your time. Or your money."}
{"text":"Best chow mein, great beef with tomatoes and the rumaki, we always get two orders. If anything Singhigh has aged well!
!Everyone has different tastes. We go out at least four times a week to a variety of places. Singhigh is always one of our favorites"}
{"text":"My egg foo young was...different today. Not the flavorful patty to which I've become accustomed. It was kind of a bummer because I was having major cravings for the Combination #1. The chow mein was good, the shrimp was very good and the fried rice was noticeably not fried rice. Humpf! Even my fortune sucked sticks: \"If you're riding ahead of the herd, look back once in a while to make sure it's still there.\" Dafuq?!"}
{"text":"Poor host, bad attitude from the start.  Server was fine. Food was satisfactory. But when you first walk in and the woman at register seats you, bad mark already. Host was what made us decide not to go back.  We had mooshu pork, shrimp fried rice, egg rolls, and was ok not bad.  Server was nice. Other places to go where host will be nicer."}
{"text":"was looking for something different, and have seen this place..allot. I'm a native Phoenix resident after all.

first i checked yelp and saw 3-4 stars based on 6 reviews. i figured sketchy, but with such a glowing review from Pierre i figured it must be good. umm. no.

my cohort ordered the chow mien. she took one bite and said no. it was drenched in a chicken gravy Ala sick. i took a bite and agreed I've had better out of ChungKing's can. in fact i wouldn't be surprised if this slop came from a can. flavorless chicken, crisp from a can celery..like seriously machine cut from a factory and stuffed into a can.

i ordered the egg foo young, with barbecue pork. it was decent to average, nothing special. i was kinda surprised to not see gills or fins on my egg foo young patties...as they were swimming in a 1 inch deep puddle of a gravy. while the gravy tasted good, i kinda like the option to drown my own food. not have it delivered to me already floating.

Pierre can keep his nostalgic toilet bowl of Chinese fare. i respect almost all of your reviews. sing high. meh. for the 17 bucks we spent on two plates, i could have gotten 4 cans of ChungKing's chow mien.

I'm not really sure how this place has lasted 80 years. I'm sure somewhere in recent history this place is a front for heroin or something else elicit. restaurants like this cannot simply survive on this quality of food. they have 3 dinning rooms and while we visited about 10 customers. 

The wait staff is mediocre, when the lady asked how we liked the food, my friend said she did not like the chow mien, she asked if my friend would like something else, while this could have been an option if she had come 15 minutes earlier after the first bite, but it was too late by now, and when the response was no, there was no attempt to make it better by removing the food from the bill. don't expect our return. 

poor service, poor to mediocre food, poor atmosphere, 1 star.
i would consider two if you took the chow mien off the bill. :P"}
