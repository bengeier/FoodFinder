{"text":"Very nice ambiance and views.  Incredible food.  My only complaint is that I ordered the 6-course tasting menu, and each course was heavier than the last-- it would have been nice to have something light in between to help me not feel so overwhelmed with richness!"}
{"text":"I'm thinking it was just an off night, but for this kind of money, off nights aren't really acceptable. First, it took forever just to get anyone to approach out table - no water, no menus, no offer of very expensive wine or drinks (and we wanted them!). Not particularly busy either, so I'm not sure what was going on.  When we did get some service, we asked about wine and the waitress (although nice) didn't have much knowledge about the Pinots we asked about. Boo. Last time we dined here, the server gave us the most amazing wine experience along with the amazing meal.  Moving on to the first course, my husband and I both ordered the iceberg wedge salad. Hard to go wrong with that, right? Nope. Worst part of the meal. Not only did it not have the avocado promised, but it was completely devoid of dressing. Further, the applewood smoked bacon was 100% fat and inedible. Avocado was brought out by the server's assistant, but we sort of gave up on the rest. Blech.  The main dishes were excellent and well prepared, so we were all getting back to the happy spirit. Then came dessert and coffee. My husband started to order the same thing as I had (chocolate souffle) but then we agreed to get two different desserts and share them. He initially considered the banana bread pudding, then changed his mind and went with the PB & J chocolate cake since I don't like bananas. Out came the banana bread pudding, naturally. Also, the souffle is not at all rich in chocolate or the least bit memorable - definitely not worth the calories. Another member of our party had ordered coffee earlier in the meal and received a nice presentation of sugars and cream. When I later ordered decaf with the dessert and asked for cream and sugar, the server's assistant asked me if I could just use my friend's leftovers (and they were truly left over - not all that much to work with as the coffee is very strong and needs lots of both). Is it really that hard to bring a new presentation of sugar and cream with the $700 dinner? I think not.   The setting, view and atmosphere are absolutely second to none, but overall, we were pretty disappointed and doubt we will go back unless we feel pretty sure this was just an off night."}
{"text":"Terrible. Absolutely HORRID service from the moment we walked in. We are avid global travelers and usually Ritz Carlton or Intercontinental advocates but decided to take Mothers Day Easter brunch at the supposedly best place in Phoenix.   The overpriced buffet is what we would expect, so expect that.  We arrived 5 minutes prior to our reservation time. No one offered a drink or flower to my wife.. or an other mothers that I could see. We finally were seated 10 minutes after our reservation time by the table next to the kitchen.  Our first waiter came to us and wasn't really sure what drinks were available, and did not specify if any were included or not in the meal. He didn't suggest we were free to go enjoy any of the food so we waited. He came back a few minutes later saying someone new was now our waitress. So then we asked if we were able to partake in the tables of food around, and he said sure. His demeanor, body language and the fact he never looked us in the eye or told my wife Happy Mothers Day wasn't a good start.  The second person came with drinks. Now this was only a few hours ago we ate, so its pretty fresh in my mind, but she came to the table 5 times the whole meal. We repeatedly had to ask for silverware, empty plates stacked up on the table, a beer bottle was sitting there empty, and had to ask twice even for more water.   Recall I said we were by the kitchen entrance so we were passed by numerous other staff all afternoon. We grabbed a couple other staff members at different times so we could get silverware to eat with. We enjoyed the food. A few good thinks to mention, however the tables were usually empty each time any of the three of us went to go eat and from our 2 hour visit there many of the items remained empty placeholders of crumbs and signs of the food that was there.  We heard waiters in the back complaining of their tips. Wow. They were VERY lucky I left them 10% and do not recall the last time in my life I ever left anything as little as that. So they are probably talking about us right now.  Well don't worry. I would never come back and highly advise anyone to go.   The staff and more so management there needs to wake up. Go spend a day or eat at comparable places. Even the Flexprint Club we enjoy as season floor seat holders has amazing service and that isn't the destination point. Oh another side note, this place was so horrible, that I have only left one other Yelp review in my life."}
{"text":"The ambiance was pleasant and the staff attentive. Had the New York Strip which was average, the seafood was fresh with delicious shrimp and oysters.  On the down side the table presentation was lacking. Never eaten at a high end restaurant that didn't have a tablecloth or sense of presentation.  Appetizers of seafood came out with main meal. Didn't seem to fit with sense presented at rest of the Four season resort and more than I would have credited it took away from the experience."}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday ....   Another quality insured restaurant, it is inside of Four Seasons, it cannot go wrong ....  The restaurant is very classy with a nice and upscale environment .... and most of all with a very nice view to the phoenix area  The service is definitely top-notch and food was excellence as well. Had the sea bass and the filet mignon .... both were yummy .... and customized birthday desert as well ....   Will go back for a visit for sure ...  Also if you are in Talavera, don't forget to grab a drink in the patio as well .... they have live music and watching the birds flying around the mountain (the resort is built into the mountain) was quite a view"}
{"text":"My Dad and I decided to try Talavera after they extended their Restaurant Week deal through the end of the year.  We arrived for a late dinner and were received by the hostess, who was thoroughly un-friendly, especially by Four Seasons standards.  Then it took over 5 minutes for our server to come over and tell us she'd be back soon to take our order.  We were a little worried that the service would be totally abysmal, but we ended up with a different server after that, but she was terrific.  We ordered the 3-course meal for $39 per person, and she nicely agreed to substitute the chocolate dessert, as chocolate keeps me up late at night.  Our first course was a salmon pastrami, and I think we were both curious to see what that meant, but it was just like it sounds - smoked salmon, peppered around the edges, and they curled it, stood it up, filled it with fresh crab meat, and drizzled citrus vinaigrette on the plate, with a side of haricots vert.  The main course was a lamb chop, with a side of a grain similar to cous-cous, although they called it something else.  The lamb was juicy and the sauce complemented it very well.  Finally, for dessert, we had the creme brulee with fresh berries and the apple pie.  Both were delicious, but my only complaint would be that the creme brulee was a little too sweet, and the dough on the pie a little too salty.  All-in-all, it was a very nice meal, in a beautiful setting.  The dining room is elegant, with a Southwestern flair, a long outdoor fire, and views overlooking the mountains and the whole city below.  It might not be one of the most progressive or acclaimed culinary destinations in the Valley, but this special pricing is a good deal for what you get, and the food is great."}
{"text":"Loved the presentation of the food. Everything was so unique! We had a nice view outside as well. Our server was friendly even after we only had water for a beverage.  We had the lobster bisque, filet, short ribs, a side of mashed potatoes, and the creme brulee dessert. Everything was great! The creme brulee had a bit too much of an alcohol taste to it.  Oh, and the bread given at the beginning was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful resort and great service! Love the desert setting and we are looking forward to a return very soon!"}
{"text":"Had dinner last night at Talavera.  Very disappointed.   Restaurant is beautiful with high end touches.   Poor marks for food quality and service.   My medium rare buffalo tenderloin was significantly overcooked.   No pink was visible.   The veggies, on the contrary were undercooked.   The carrots were warm on the outside and cold in the middle.    I never send food back but was ready to make an exception in this case.   However, the waitstaff was nowhere to be found.  After receiving my entree 40 min elapsed before anyone followed up to see how we were doing.   I don't necessarily blame the servers as they seemed to be significantly understaffed.   I expect much, much more from an expensive restaurant at a Four Seasons resort.   Extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"OMG! had a great time at this restaurant. We were seated on the patio and it was fabulous! The food was delicious and the service was prompt. Awesome views! very romantic....and finally, they had fireworks at 9pm on that Saturday that we were there. Ordered fish and lamb..both were yummy! Dessert was also fantastic."}
{"text":"I came here for a work dinner while staying at the resort and had a lovely time.  The food was quite good, but I wasn't blown away.  Although, this may have been partially attributed to the fact that there was a pre-selected menu for our group dinner and none of the items were things that I would generally order. The rolls that they serve with dinner are delicious and the dessert was my favorite part of the meal.  We all had the creme brulee, which was set on fire as it was served to us, creating a mouthwatering aroma of burning sugar. Mmmmm.  Oh, and it tasted just as good as it smelled!  We were lucky enough to sit on the patio (with the aid of some heat lamps) and were able to enjoy both the fantastic view and the massive fireplace. Overall it was a great experience between the good food, great service, and beautiful patio atmosphere."}
{"text":"The only reason why I didn't toss in that fifth star is because it's a pricy meal, but that doesn't take away from the \"delish\" factor. We participated in the Mash Up menu (dodging past the Restaurant Week prix fix menu) because The Breadfruit & Talavera were combining talents & flavors, & we enjoy both restaurants. If you go, try one of the Mash Up deals. Just go to their website to see who'll be the next Valley chef to partner with Chef Mel in the kitchen. And, try to catch a sunset. It's a beautiful property, & a great backdrop to a great meal. This crew knew what to do &I how to do it well!"}
{"text":"Excellent appetizers (gnocchi a real standout) and the steak was incredible. Wine list first rate for good domestic choices and vast internationals also.   Only real letdown was the hours in summer, how can a restaurant inside a hotel close down Monday thru Thursday?"}
{"text":"We came to Talavera for a fancy meal while my wife and I were staying at the Four Seasons.  For some reason we had two waiters, one to \"back up\" the other one.  This meant that we had our drink and dessert orders taken twice and didn't seem to help any since they brought me the wrong beer and my wife the wrong first coarse.  My wife really enjoyed the snap pea risotto, my steak was so-so.  Not worth the money."}
{"text":"I always like to have an experience where I can't find any fault.  I came here during restaurant week, and they offered a great three course meal.  We sat outside on a perfect evening with a beautiful fire right next to us, but not too hot.  I started with an elderflower drink which was wonderful.  My steak entree was perfect, as was the coffee after the meal.  All in all, this is a great place to dine.  The main menu had many other things that I would have ordered, but they had a very interesting 3-course menu offering that I couldn't refuse.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This is an over-due review since we went there for Valentines Day dinner. The ambiance was good, the food delicious, and the service was friendly and attentive.  I would say that the food wasn't the best we have had, but it was certainly delicious and the desert was very memorable. Overall, we would go again."}
{"text":"As soon as the sunsets and the breeze comes in off the mountain it is very comfortable out on the beautiful porch even in August. Fabulous food exquisite service, an excellent dining experience!"}
{"text":"No stay at the four seasons is complete without a dinner at Talavera. Wonderful food. Great ambiance. Not pretentious. One of our favorite places!"}
{"text":"I wanted to treat my wife to a extra special Mother's Day Brunch. I don't mind splurging for special occasion but Talavera is WAAAAY OVERPRICED. The location is unique but it certainly doesn't justify charging $100 per person for a buffet with no live music (not even on Mother's Day!?!), poor service (we had to ask multiple times for our $12 mimosa's!?!), and to top it off the food selection was nothing special (where's the filet?!?). Shame on Four Seasons for the poor showing - this experience certainly tarnished your seemingly pristine reputation."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Phoenix w/ gorgeous views! The quality of food is outstanding as well as the service. We went last night for our anniversary and had a wonderful experience. I would even say it is better than Mastro's restaurants! Eat here you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Recently visited Talavera for a 'special occasion' dinner based on a friend's recommendation. It lived up to its expectations. We were seated outside and enjoyed a gorgeous sunset during our meal. The dishes themselves were as impressive as the view.   I highly recommend the jumbo prawn dish if you like seafood. They were cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth! The chocolate soufflé was an outstanding finish to the meal. Excited to go back!"}
{"text":"We celebrated our anniversary here and the setting, food and most importantly service was one of the best we've ever experienced. The staff went above and beyond to make our evening special. We highly recommend this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"We went on our anniversary and they treated us to personalizes menus and a complimentary dessert! We've been here twice now and we have only had great experiences, we are blown away by the food, service and location every time we visit! We will be back soon :)"}
{"text":"Just an addendum... Keisha is the best server ever! She had the chef bring us some bonus scallops with risotto. Great service,  wonderful food."}
{"text":"Brilliant service, amazing food and awesome views. The seafood tower was to die for with an assortment of oysters. The prawns were so large with great flavor."}
{"text":"Unbelievably yummy food!  Excellent service and a great wine selection!  Top of my list!"}
{"text":"We often frequent the Four Seasons Scottsdale, and always make a point of dining at Talavera. In addition to the great ambiance and gorgeous views, the food and service are sensational. The steaks and seafood are prepared to perfection, and their wine list is second to none. The chefs (Mel and Jesse) do a great job with creativity and quality. In addition to the food, Talavera is a special place because of the people that work there. Susan is our favorite food server of all time, and she is an absolute joy to talk with. She anticipates our every need. If Susan has the night off, ask for Penny or any of the other food servers as they all do a great job. Whether it's a special occasion or simply a night out, Talavera is a great experience."}
{"text":"Wow, this was so good we went twice!  Outstanding service!  The bread cooked in small iron pans was amazing.  Had a rib eye that was huge and cooked perfectly, without much gristle or fat.  Possibly the best ribeye I have ever had!  Wife had seabass which was excellent also.  Another night had rack of lamb again cooked perfectly.  Our two wine selections were outstanding, and old vine zin and a cab that I think came from Chimney Rock.  A little pricey but great place to splurge a little."}
{"text":"I am a local, residing very near The Four Seasons. This is a first class operation.  We go to Talavera several times a year, to celebrate,or to have a quiet meal, etc.  Pork Chops are fantastic.  Warm rolls, whipped butter sprinkled with Hawaiian salt.  Everything done with precision and expertise.  You will want to try some things you never had before!  Service impeccable, as one would expect at The Four Seasons.  I love that they call us by name:  Mr and Mrs.  We will go back again and again.  Views are incredible, outside dining, too.  Very special place.   Great Onyx bar."}
{"text":"Great service and ambiance. Good food, but not worth the price ($200 for 2 people at dinner, not including tip)."}
{"text":"We loved it!! Food is great and really nice staff but the view it's what make this place worthy of coming back!"}
{"text":"This place was a complete disaster for their Valentine's evening tasting menu.  Nothing seemed to go well.  Clearly, they were massively understaffed.  The entire experience made me rate our stay at Four Seasons lower (and subsequently not want to return).     We arrived on time and were seated at a table that was wobbly (thankfully, this was quickly corrected).  The dinner on Valentine's day was a tasting menu (and we opted for the optional sparkling wine pairing).  What followed was a plodding 3.5 hour experience where we were routinely forgotten about and served disgusting-appearing (and frequently poorly-tasting) food.  It was clear when we first arrived that they were MASSIVELY understaffed.  Our waiter was kind but in a rush the entire time, running from table to table (he actually dumped sparkling wine on a patron's dress during the time we were there as he was moving so quickly).  We waited a good 20 minutes before the first course arrived.  Meh, average oysters with a shooter.  Again, we waited another 20 minutes before the next course (they would bring the sparkling wine at least 10-15 minutes, if not more, before the actual course).  The next course was a complete disaster of appearance (if you're brave enough, see the photos below).  Are those horns coming out of store-bought, canned tuna (because that is what it tasted like)?  At this point, they COMPLETELY forgot a course, trying to bring out the next two wine pairings.  When we pointed this out, they quickly took away the extra wine (despite waiting 40 minutes for the next course).  This course, the ravioli, was the only course that tasted decent with a complex flavor that I would expect from a restaurant such as this.  I will give them credit for this course alone.  The main course was a tenderloin that was massively overcooked (with silverware with food stuck to it!!!  see below).  The rest of the meal was completely bland and not memorable.    I hope this restaurant gets its act together.  What a disaster!!!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with friends last week. Loved sitting outside on the patio in this beautiful Fall weather. Great bar before dinner too!  The men had steaks, while the ladies had sea bass and scallops. All was delicious.  Beautiful ambience, great food, and good service. Perfect evening!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 12 for our senior prom night. The food was fantastic and the waiters were outstanding. Not exactly the cheapest place in town but the great steak and sides made up for it completely. Would come again and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Spectacular view of Pinnacle Peak and McDowell Mountain.  Patio is a great experience.  Ordered the chef's tasting menu.  Started with their house bread with Hawaiian sea salt.  First course was tuna tartar with a quail egg.  Balsamic reduction made for w very wonderful start.  Mild tuna with a very flavorful egg.  Second course was a pea tendril salad with fig, plums, prosciutto, Gorgonzola and lemon soubiy.  Charred Spanish octopus with chorizo, shishito peppers, onion and potato, wow!!  Next up was a melt in your mouth tender and mild poached halibut.  Favorite course!  Bison tenderloin with spiced brandied cherries, mole, and fois gras!! A flavor explosion!!  Brûlée plum, fage ice cream, pecans and Carmel sauce. Amazing dessert.  Top 5 all time meals."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the portions were a nice size. I had the veal porterhouse and my boyfriend had the bone in pork chop. If you sit outside you can look out over the horizon and see the desert fade into the city lights. If you hit it just right you can watch a beautiful sunset as you eat. The restaurant was romantic and interestingly decorated. Once it gets dark you also have an opportunity to see a swarm of bats flying over head, which was cool and frightening at the same time.   The only complaint was our server. When we arrived my bf had a bit of an upset stomach and we asked the server for a glass of ginger ale, he made a disgusted face but went to retrieve it. He never told us about any of the specials on the menu and we rarely saw him throughout the meal. He did say he would be assisted by someone and she was lovely. Our server's fingers were chewed to bloody messes and we were the ones making disgusted faces when he pointed to something on the menu."}
{"text":"Not four seasons worthy! Food was salty and amateurish, as was the staff. the transition from the bar to the restaurant was awkward. Our sides came after the main dish had been eaten and they were the wrong side dishes, which might have been ok if the entire salt shaker had not been dumped into it!  The only saving grace was the manager who realized how awful the service and food were.  Don't bother driving that far north, stop when you get to Mastro's."}
{"text":"Great views from this restaurant which is really one of the only truly positive things I can say about the experience. This was a $220+ dinner for two and it was at a Four Seasons resort so yes, my standards are high - as they should be! Here are a few notes, that I sent to the manager after she gave me her card and told me to email her when I complained that they also neglected my husband's birthday -- and it was written into the reservation!  1. I asked for water at least three separate times. Why?  2. The waiter wasn't consultative on my wine selection. I asked him to describe the wine in a way that would translate to a typical California wine - Merlot, Cab, Pinot and he seemed a little stumped by this question. I wound up (by my own choice) trying something new - Barbera (sp?) and wound up loving it though. 3. Our food was all quite good. My issue was with the shrimp primarily - lots of work to remove shell, messy. I asked the waiter for guidance on my selections and he really didn't provide a lot of feedback to me regarding the tapas selection or an appetizer.  4. My husband's birthday was completely neglected. I have attached a picture of the note from the concierge that specifically called out his birthday on the reservation. She also made a big deal saying that she was making the note when I made reservation last month, so my expectation was that it would be highlighted in some way. The hostess also didn't recognize his birthday either.  5. Sidenote - our waiter seemed to have a lot of tables and I thought overall the pace of the service wasn't timed all that well. He seemed rushed at our table - I believe he had at least three, possibly four other tables which could explain why we thought he wasn't all that attentive or consultative.  Overall - this place is not worth the money. There are so many great options in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I was expecting a great night out with friends. Extremely disappointing. Took for ever to get our table despite reservations. Service was slow. We ordered 3 seafood paellas and one meat. The order was reversed and we had to wait another 30 minutes for the new plates to come back. Two were way too over cooked. Overall the worse paella I have ever had. Two plates stayed untouched as it was flavorless. No chorizo in two out of three. The seafood one was very blend also. My hat off to the manager who tried to help the best he could but what he needs is cooks who know what they are doing.  NOT RECOMMENDED. Too bad as the view is awesome."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and beautiful presentation. Our server was very attentive and knowledgeable. Would definitely recommend sitting on the patio - the views are spectacular! Unfortunately, it was a cold night so we opted for a table inside. I rarely find a creative vegetarian dish but they succeeded here - I highly recommend the veggie wellington - portabello and oyster mushrooms - delightful!"}
{"text":"My husband I came here for Valentine's Day and were very disappointed. We're a young couple and the server kind of seemed to brush us off. We also weren't drinking and it felt like we were last priority. While I expected the food to be expensive, I also expected the quality to match. It did not. My scallops were good, but the sauce they were in was not to my liking. It was so acidic that my mouth became tense. The corn did not have a flavor I enjoyed either. Upsides: kind valet man, incredible view, my husband's steak. Downsides: service, price did not match quality, the rest of our food."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday with my boyfriend for our 1 year anniversary/valentines day. Made reservations for 6:30 but arrived early to grab cocktails at the Onyx Bar & sat outside in the patio area watching the sunset...it was very beautiful & romantic. Afterwards we were seated outside in the patio area of the restaurant right next to the fireplace facing the mountain view. Again it was a very beautiful & romantic ambience.   We started our dinner with complimentary warm hot dinner rolls that were super yummy & addicting. They were freshly baked & were so soft that it melted in your mouth. They were topped poppy seeds & came with butter topped with Hawaiian sea salt...so good! Next we shared a beet, pear, arugula & candied pecan salad. For entrees we had the sea bass topped with braised short rib on a bed of potato risotto and the \"cow of the week\" which was waygu beef with risotto & foie gras. We also ordered the lobster Mac & cheese (it was decent but not memorable). We were pleased with our dinner & it ended with complimentary chocolate covered cheesecake bites. They also gave us a small box of truffles as a gift for our anniversary. Overall the service & staffs were great. We had a wonderful & beautiful time here at Talavera & would recommend it to others."}
{"text":"We ate here a few days ago while on vacation at the four seasons resort.  So glad we choose to eat here. Had mastros steakhouse the night before but this blew that out of the water.  The wife had the Chilean sea bass and I had the filet.  Both cooked really well and so flavorful.  We set outside on the patio which has an awesome view of pinnacle peak and the troon area.    The restaurant has a great wine menu and the drinks are very good.  Start off with a drink at the onyx bar! Had the blueberry cheesecake for desert and it was really refreshing.  You should definitely go try out this place if are in the area or if you are staying at the hotel! Enjoy"}
{"text":"We went to Talavera for restaurant week and the experience did not inspire me to want go back and pay full price for a meal.  The setting is magnificent but it can't make up for uneven service and just okay food.  We sat at the table for nearly 15 minutes before ever getting a menu or a glass of water--when we finally did get to order, the bottle of wine took an inordinately long time to come out.  The service did get better as the night went on--but the damage had been done.--and the food--it was just okay--not bad but I was expecting knock my socks off from a restaurant at this level. I have no strong interest in driving from central Phoenix for just okay food--when I can get great food in my own neighborhood for a fraction of the proce."}
{"text":"How disappointing was Christmas dinner! We normally have an excellent Christmas dinner at Different Pointe of View but decided to try something new this year. Never again. For starters, the place is insanely small and difficult to get around. The staircases are very tight and made difficult for my disabled daughter. Secondly, after believing we had a reservation for 5, we had to wait until they prepared a 'table' for my family of 3.   This very wobbly 'table' was a 2' x 2' upright log with a piece of glass atop. Extremely small and nary enough space for 3 guests. Thirdly, our 'table' was out in the middle of the floor in a room that was clearly not intended for dining. Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of our Christmas dinner was the blatant disrespect and discrimination against our small party (less tip? no alcohol?) and sheer favoritism over those guests who decided to wear a suit. We were told the dress code was 'resort casual'... therefore, we came in resort casual: slacks, collared shirt for my son, slacks and pretty blouses for me and my daughter. Nope. We watched, over and over again, as our TWO servers walked right past our table-log and never offered to refresh our drinks. We literally had plates STACKED on top of each other before someone would remove them. It was so sad that it became comical; we would speculate whether multiple servers/attendants would stop by our table-log or not. The icing on the cake was when our 'server' brought the adjacent table their check - these nice folks were all glittery and wearing suits - with a lovely box of 'complementary truffles.' Their check came in a lovely leather case with this box of truffles on top. Our 'server' asked these folks if they were staying with them at the Four Seasons: no. Worst service I have ever received in any scale of restaurant. Period.  When we had to wave down our server to ask for the check, he brought three FORKS over to the table and said 'for your dessert.' I said, 'We've already had dessert.' Another pointed attention to detail from this guy... and no, he did not refresh our drinks when we had dessert. Our dessert, by the way, was absolutely atrocious. We could choose between a 'chocolate popsicle' (which was nothing more than chocolate hardened into a round and stuck on a stick), a horribly commercialized 'apple lattice pie' that tasted like cardboard, and a cranberry shot of something or other than had no taste at all.   About 10 mins later, our 'server' reports to our table with our check: a cheap piece of plastic clipboard and no truffles. He asked the same question: are you staying with us? No sir, we are not. He made some offhand comment about enjoying the holiday and didn't even glance back at us as we got out our wallet to pay for $100 per person for this place.  Word to the wise: at Different Pointe of View, they treat you like family, regardless of how you are dressed, how many glittery things you have on your fingers, and are especially kind to my disabled daughter. At DPOV, the food is infinitely BETTER with a far greater selection of each course in the buffet, and the service is unsurpassed in a warm, welcoming environment of real people who genuinely care that you spent $65 per person at their establishment.  Different Point of View, we are coming home."}
{"text":"Just wow. The service, food, views are pristine. This was one of the best meals I've had in Scottsdale! We missed the sunset which would have been a  nice addition to our dining experience but nonetheless it was a great time. The seafood platter was perfect, same with really any dish on the menu. The chocolate soufflé was a nice treat as you don't really see that on the menu anymore. Thanks for a lovely dinner!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! Tried pok belly for the first time, I could eat that til the day I die. The veal porterhouse was amazing. I had the pecan crusted venison....loved. However, our server was less than tolerant of my friend who was 84 years old. He normally tips 40 to 50 percent. He got 20 percent and was lucky."}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner! This was our second time coming here and we couldn't be more pleased with the service and food. We came for our anniversary and they personalized our menus and gifted us with a complimentary dessert! Our waiter Sam was very attentive and made our experience that much more enjoyable. Thanks for the awesome night! We will be back!"}
{"text":"It was the wife's birthday and someone suggested we go to Talavera. What a great idea! The martinis come with bleu cheese stuffed olives. Wifey doesn't drink much so I had some of the house- recommended cabernet. Ass puckering dry and great. We don't eat a lot, so we split the 20 oz ribeye - which was perfect. We also got some fois gras just to piss off the PETA assholes.  The whole experience was great and I give an unconditional recommendation to anyone.  Speaking of my wife's birthday- this is kind of creepy and I never thought of it 40 years ago - tonight, I am going to hop in bed with a 68 year old woman!  Our server - Penny - was invisible until we needed her. The spectacular view adds a great touch.  I know that old people split plates because they can't finish everything, but don't worry - we always overtip when we do.  A great place to go for a special ocassion."}
{"text":"Perhaps it's the summer.  The service was JV. They work hard and tried to pleas but they just didn't have the polish or expertise.  Nothing JV about the food. Outstanding and perfectly prepared.  The salmon  and streak were perfect.  Presentation was first class but not over the top. I would suggest a visit in h spring or winter.  Prices are the same."}
{"text":"Came to the Four Seasons for our honeymoon. I organized a private dinner on the patio at Talavera more so I asked if FS could make it happen and they did the rest. Everything from the service, to the view, to the food was perfect! My husband got the bison and he said it was a Top 3 best meal in his life. I got the chicken which was also delicious. The only downside was that the meal had to end. I've been dreaming about it since last night!!!"}
{"text":"Overall, we enjoyed our time but too many things were average to say we'll return.  The view and ambiance are great. We were there for sunset and it was beautiful.  The service was 5 stars for the most part with several different people attending to the table. They have quite a unique specialty cocktail menu, my husband got 2 different drinks and he enjoyed both quite a bit.  I stuck with wine.  Appetizer: Octopus - Average We may be spoiled from having octopus in Greece, but it was a little tough.  I know its meant to be a little chewy, but this was on the tougher side.  Main: CAB Filet - Very Good  Main: Bacon Wrapped Buffalo w/ Foie Gras - Average/Underwhelming   Lack of flavor and very one note. I was very surprised given all the different elements on the plate.  The carrots had this super orange sugary flavor that didn't compliment the meal.  Sides: Spaghetti Squash Carbonara - Terrible It was cold, mushy and lacked seasoning.  Sides: Lobster Mac & Cheese - Average Every fancy restaurant now has this and its never as good as it sounds  Dessert: Souffle - Very good  Glad we went, checked that box. We're still waiting to find a dining experience in Phx/Scottsdale to blow us away - the search continues...."}
{"text":"Seemed overpriced for what the end product was. We're on vacation staying at the Four Seasons and had dinner with friends here Friday night. It took a very long time for each course (which we were warned about by our waitstaff when we arrived that it would take a long time for our food to come). Disappointed is really the right thing to say. I expected better from a Four Seasons restaurant as the Residence Club has been amazing to stay at. There's probably a better steakhouse in town at a better price than here. Honestly the fajitas we ordered by the pool were better. Staff was nice and the view from the patio was nice, review of 2 stars based on the food."}
{"text":"Talavera offers outstanding service, very good food, and an absolutely gorgeous setting for a special meal. The price tag is hefty but I left feeling like I had a luxurious meal so I certainly think it's worth it for celebratory occasions. The service was superb. It seemed like our waiter was dedicated to us and our table of 2 (even if that wasn't the case). There was never a long wait, it always felt like he was going above and beyond, and it was all very nice. When making my reservation with Open Table I noted it was someone's birthday and the menus were specially printed with a birthday message - talk about a nice touch! The setting is breathtakingly gorgeous. Of course the Four Seasons grounds are beautiful, and there is wonderful Pinnacle Peak and the sunset to enjoy off the patio. If the weather allows it, I highly recommend a patio table.   The food was very good too. I guess the only reason this is a 4 star review instead of 5 stars is that the dessert wasn't all that great. I should say the dessert we paid for* because the complimentary truffles we received with a birthday message (again, what outstanding and caring service!) were amazing. I had:  - Beet & Goat Cheese Salad: Such a beautiful dish, a real treat for the eyes. It also tasted very good, so while not unique nor large, it was a yummy start to the meal. I probably wouldn't order it again though - the only app I need is the complimentary buttery skillet bread. - Butternut Squash Risotto: The vegetarian entree for the day and I initially groaned because risotto is the de facto veg entree. This was the best risotto I've ever had! So creamy yet the rice still had a strong texture to it, instead of being mushy. The mushrooms and other vegetables were a great mix of textures and overall the flavor was very good. - Chocolate Mousse: I just didn't like this. It was too rich and I've never met a chocolate mousse I didn't like. Some fresh berries or a light cream could have gone a long way in balancing it out. - Croissant Creme Brulee: Also underwhelming. The fried carrot strips were not to my taste and the croissant pieces just seemed stale."}
{"text":"Yelp has a dearth of Scottsdale reviews on fine dining. So it stands to reason that places with only a small handful of 4 or 5 star reviews are met with a bit of skepticism. I wasn't too sure what to expect as we headed into Talavera. All I knew was that it was at the Four Seasons, so we could expect it to be pretentious and expensive. But would it be good??  A resounding YES. This place was hands down the best dinner we had our entire 4 days there. My monstrous rib-eye was cooked perfectly and bursting with flavor. It did not even need the smattering of gorgonzola butter that came with, I would have easily devoured this beauty all on its natural own. My husband's duo-lamb specialty was eaten with great reverence, and that plate was almost licked clean.  A sweet, electric pink prickly pear blended margarita was a nice surprise in a fancy atmosphere that looked like it was made only for expensive wines. Try the Olive bread with the gorgonzola and red pepper spread. Skip the sides if you don't have the room. The ham mac n' cheese was good but I've had better. The charred corn was good, but again, I've made better. Save your appetite for the main event.  The view here is simply astounding, there is no other way to say it. See my photo. If you are evening dining, you absolutely must sit outside, hopefully along the glass wall to get the best view of the grounds and valley.  My steak was so good that I didn't even save room for dessert, which is virtually unheard of if you know me. Nevertheless, our tireless and friendly waiter presented the check with two little cheesecake bites on a stick covered in a shell of white chocolate. A perfectly sweet end to a fabulous pre-Anniversary dinner.  Oh....and the only thing pretentious was the people sitting next to us demanding their wine, proclaiming their unhappiness, and denouncing our extremely harried (yet competent) server. Seriously, again...what is up with all the bitter people vacationing in AZ??"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this restaurant.  It was not too busy and it had a descent view. I had the 20 oz ribeye and my girlfriend had a New York steak. My steak looks a lot smaller than 20 oz but that's probably better for my health.   The steaks were served on a metal skillet . It was kind of weird and does not feel high end. I really think other steakhouses down the street is a lot better for the same price. Probably wont go back again."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Food, atmosphere, staff, ambiance. Nothing short of brilliant and a jewel in the Arizona desert."}
{"text":"We went here for my wife's birthday, and it's a rare 5-star review for me. They scored on food, presentation, service and atmosphere. We sat indoors - it's a bit hot out still - and loved the decor, including the fun pillows on our large booth seat. Service was prompt, friendly, and attentive - but we never felt rushed. They make a killer mango mojito that perfectly balances the mango, lime and rum flavors. The kurobuta pork was perfectly prepared. And after having some disappointing lobster (in Maine of all places) the Maine lobster here was done just right - firm but not tough. They serve it \"lazy style\" and did a great job with both claw and tail meat coming out perfectly. A special birthday souffle topped the evening off. Expensive but absolutely worth it for a special occasion."}
{"text":"We hadn't been to the restaurant at the Four Seasons since it changed from Acacia to Talavera, so we figured we should give it a try while staying at the Four Seasons overnight.  We split the shrimp and lobster bisque and the restaurant was nice enough to split the serving in two bowls.  It was good, but not quite as amazing as I was expecting.  For my entree, I enjoyed the sea bass with potato risotto - again, good, but not as good as I was expecting for a Four Seasons and the price you are expected to pay.  The restaurant is beautifully appointed, the views are beautiful and the service was fun and laid back."}
{"text":"Couldn't have asked for anything more. We went for Christmas eve dinner with our two adult children. Everything was fabulous from the bread to the dessert. I would go back for the coffee alone!  It was that good. Be prepared to pay a hefty price for this fabulousness though. We spent $472 before tip for four people. I would absolutely go back."}
{"text":"The view was amazing, the drinks were wicked expensive (albeit tasty), the food was fantastical and the ambiance on the patio was pretty darn romantic. My water glass was very small but was NEVER empty as we seemed to have a team of people tending to our table (party of 7). Also, the cheesecake lollipops at the end of the meal were an added bonus and I'll be making the hour long treck up there again just for those little suckers!!   Worth the drive, worth the money! Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and wonderful ambiance.  The service was really slow, especially at the beginning, but they may have been short handed.  They more than made up for it with the courses.  Kind of pricey, but worth it, especially considering it's a resort restaurant."}
{"text":"I fell in love last night! Thank goodness to Restaurant Week, otherwise I might not have tried this place.  It is quite a hike from where I live, but then again, what isn't? The drive up to the resort to get to the restaurant is beautiful, so you sitting outside on the patio is a no brainer.    We were greeted kindly by the hostess and seated immediately.    I started with the mango mint julep.  The bread was so soft and moist.  Next, I had the tuna carpaccio with pork belly croutons.  That is basically having the best of both worlds.  Next I had the Bison Short Ribs with Mushroom demi glaze and crab mashed potatoes.  I have this rule about overeating, but I had no choice to ignore it.  The only thing I wish was different was that I would have liked more of the mushroom demi glaze. I boxed my dessert since I was already sooo full, but did of course have some of my husbands.  The creme brulee was delicious.   I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If you desire a spectacular dining experience a visit to Talavera is a must!   The service is exceptional, the waitstaff very knowledgeable, the food and wine phenomenal and the views are breathtaking. In true Four Season's fashion attention to detail and five star service abound from the moment you set foot onto the resort until you leave. (if you valet park, you will find a box of truffles and a THANK you note in your vehicle!)   The romantic, elegant, rustic ambiance of this fabulous establishment paired with an extensive wine list and delicious menu leaves a persons soul feeling rejuventated."}
{"text":"The bill was 150.00 and that was after a free appetizer coupon they sent me via email.  The food was no where near worth the HIGH price!  The service was not up to par either.  I really can't believe people pay such high prices for food that come with NO sides, etc.  I got iced tea to drink and it cost a whopping $6.00.  That's right folks....6.00 for a glass of tea.  What is that 100% profit/mark up?  I paid 12.00 for a soup sampler.  Each of the three soups were in a tiny espresso cup.  My salmon was no better than what I get at Texas roadhouse but it was three times the price.  I would definitely not recommended this place.  If you want a fancy, awesome meal go to Houston's!  The one thing that was great were the rolls (they were free too)!  Don't get me wrong the food is good but not worth the price tag!  You can get just as good food a lot of other places for a lot cheaper!"}
{"text":"The menu was creative and most importantly it was perfectly executed. The seared foie gras was creamy and had a strong umami flavor. The beef carpaccio was tracing-paper thin with a perfectly light yet noticeable fat content full of flavor. The seafood platter was perfectly done as well. Attention to detail was evident at every stage."}
{"text":"What a wonderful patio!  The best cocktail I have had in ages, the LA Thymes.  And dinner was DELICIOUS!  Perfectly cooked filet.  The only thing I would say is the atmosphere is a  touch stuffy and the wine rec was lack luster.  Good food and good service!"}
{"text":"This place is more like a 41/2.  Pricey but well worth it.  This is the second time we've been here and just as good as the first time.  We ordered a couple of Ketel One martinis for starters.  With dinner ordered a bottle of their Iconoclast house Cab, pretty good and reasonably priced.  The wild salmon was to die for, couldn't have been happier.  A side of crab and sautéed spinach were nice as well.  The ahi was excellent to boot.  The fennel added a nice level of flavor.  Let me just say this - I LOVE THAT FREAKIN BREAD!  It is so good it's hard to describe.  Comes out in a cast iron pan and glazed with a little butter and salt,  WOW.  I would pay big bucks just for the bread.  The truffles when you leave we're a nice touch.  I had a single espresso also, which was as expected.  Solid service, beautiful view and sunset, and great food.  A drive to get up there but absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"The Scottsdale dining scene really impressed us during our stay and Talavera was one of the best. The restaurant is beautiful and they have both outdoor patio and indoor seating. They also have a few wine cellar table where they have wine tastings during the week for resort guests, a nice bonus that we made sure to take advantage of.   The menu took advantage of local produce and suppliers and we feasted. We started with a few salads, the heirloom tomato and burrata and the goat cheese, beets and arugula. Our salads were both great and the cheese and produce were fantastic. Great starts, but it was the entrees we were really looking forward to. Typically when we go out, it's surf and turf. Seafood for my wife and nice cut for me. So much to choose from on this menu. Duck breast, lamb chops, bone in ribeye....hmmmm. I ended up having the Buffalo tenderloin with smoked bacon and a cherry sauce. I must have made the right choice as this arrived perfectly bloody and juicy and the bacon was so tasty.(mmm bacon) My wife had the tuna and it was very good too. A la carte sides were interesting and we added the charred corn to our feast.   The view, service and presentations were all impeccable. Seriously, you are at the FS and it is a treat. They really took great care of us and the other diners (like the couple celebrating their anniversary next to us). Talavera was a treat and a perfect start for our culinary tour of your fine city."}
{"text":"This was a hugely disappointing experience. My husband and I went in and chose to do the tasting menu because we love the experience of being surprised by what the chef chooses to do. The food was fine. Just fine. One course was actually a leftover special from Valentine's Day the day before (ricotta raviolo with citrus beets and a beet dust--not impressive), which seemed a little lazy to me. Probably my favorite dish was the octopus with sausage and potatoes. The octopus was so crispy and delicious, although it was served with a mustard that looked shockingly close to French's yellow mustard. This wasn't terrible though because it went so well with everything on the plate. The other dishes were fine, forgettable. Probably forgettable because it took FOREVER for them to course out our meal. I don't know if this was incorrect coursing/pacing done by our server or by the kitchen. Regardless, it was agonizingly long between courses (especially considering one course was leftovers). So much so that by the time the fourth course finally came out, we were both done eating since we had sat so long. There was no rhythm to this meal. The fifth course (short rib variation of what they normally serve) and sixth course (a boring chocolate dish) were mostly untouched because we were too full and over the whole dining process to eat anymore. The wine paring didn't quite gel with all the dishes either. There were a few wines that just weren't good and a few we would have paired oppositely.  I should note, the server was really gracious to replace my spilled martini so that was great of him.  All in all, we would not go back. I hate to feel like I've wasted my time or money; and that evening, I felt like both were wasted. Shame really."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful place surrounded by the canyons and lucky us, we were right under the Eclipse moon the night we went! There was also some event downstairs at the hotel so we were also able to see how beautiful this venue would be for an event in the future.   We sat outside, which was very nice. Started the meal with the Lobster-Corn Bisque, which was just spectacular-burst of flavors! It's one of those dishes where it's just not enough and you don't want it to end.  For the second course, I got the Medallion of New York strip loin  chorizo mac & cheese, which was good but after the Lobster-corn bisque, it was hard to impress me at this point. Their steak wasn't anything special but it was very tender. The chorizo mac & cheese on the other hand was another \"I don't want to finish this\" dish.   I got the Warm Stonefruit Cobbler cornmeal with honey ice cream for dessert. It was delicious and I finished it even though I was extremely full from my meal.   I'll definitely go back to try the other dishes!"}
{"text":"We are currently staying at the Four Seasons Troon North and for some reason have never eaten at their signature restaurant Talavera........... We went there a few nights ago to celebrate our daughters college acceptance to UC Davis and they pulled out all the stops!  They printed a congratulations note on the menu which made this very special for our daughter.  The service and food was fantastic!!  At the end of our meal they prepared a special cake for our daughter and it was fabulous.....did not think I would ever taste a cake as good as our wedding cake but it was all that and more. Thanks Four Seasons for making our daughters night one she will never forget!!!"}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to go to Talavera ever since I fell in love with a scallop they served at West of Western (pre-Devoured) and, finally, seized the opportunity with Restaurant Week.  Most definitely it's a 5 star setting: the view, the decor, the live music on the patio.  I would give the food a solid 3.5 stars. Based on the restaurant week menu, I enjoyed a scallop (that's what I came for, after all!) which was as good as I remembered, complimented by rich, meaty bits of short rib and diced potato.   My main course was the pork tenderloin: a more than generous portion of pork cooked medium. The description said it would be served with acorn squash, fall greens and queen creek fig balsamic. The balsamic was merely a plate garnish and did nothing for the flavor profile (which I found disappointing, as I was really looking forward to it) and the squash sure tasted more like potato than squash.   I finished with the Madagascar vanilla flambrulee. The shallow dish was delivered and the sugar crystals brought to flame right at my place. Very dramatic. The other desserts were only even more amazing! A cheesecake served between two pieces of brioche to look like a slider paired with \"fries\" made of funnelcake and a raspberry coulis \"ketchup,\" stealing the show.  Hands down, this place hits desserts out of the park!   The idea of coming here for dessert in a romantic setting is easy to conceptualize! I would give 5 stars for dessert alone.   Unfortunately, service, while cheerful and courteous, was slow. Particularly in the beginning when it took at least 15 minutes for menus and water to be brought to the table -- and that was after a request that someone be notified (aka reminded) that we had been seated.   The restaurant week menu looked like an eye exam - confusing and very difficult to read.  The drink prices were probably the biggest deterrent. $16 glasses of wine or margaritas just made me think of other places I could enjoy a meal as good, if not better, and either bring my own or pay less. Not to mention, phenomenal crafted cocktails prepared by \"celebrity\" mixologists found closer to home! (Don't even get me started on the $6 iced tea!)  We wound up with a $68 bottle with little or no encouragement from our server, despite the fact that they were supposedly offering a summer 'Wine Down' program with 35 wines that are discounted at 35% off. I didn't notice any mention of that at the time.  If I ever give up drinking, maybe I'll come back. Otherwise, my Talavera experience may have been a one night stand..."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Four Seasons for my lady's birthday and as a birthday gift I wanted to treat her to this restaurant.  I informed the staff ahead of the time and they prepared a menu with a Happy 26th on it with her name, and they offered to have it signed by the Head Chef and gave it a very romantic looking bow.  When we first entered, they greeted us both by name and wished my lady a Happy Birthday.  Umm YES! Way to make me look like a stud.  Then we decided to ball out and try their 6 course tasting menu.  That was definitely the right move.  We paired it was an absolutely superb Malbec and were delighted from course to course as we went on an extended surf and turf meal.  To say it was sublime would be an understatement.  This is one of the meals that I will remember forever, and that in its essence is worthy of five stars.  Yes, it is expensive and because of that price you must raise your expectations.  Talavera exceeded all of my expectations and more.  Can't wait to dine here again!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience. If you was fabulous and the food was excellent. Great hamburgers wonderful ice tea"}
{"text":"We had a dinner at this romantic restaurant. Food and service were great! We ordered the Buffalo and New York Strip w/ Seared Foie Gras, delicious! Steak was cooked just right and the Foie Gras was crispy outside and juicy inside! Will definitely come again!!  Services - 7/10 Atmosphere -8/10 Decor - 7/10 Food -  8/10 Price - around $110 for a 3-course meal with a glass of wine, not including the tips.  Occasion - date night, family gathering, business dinner, or girls night out."}
{"text":"A very disappointing experience! Of course the view and ambiance were fabulous and the wine list excellent, but that's where the enjoyment ended. The food was over cooked, overpriced and overdone. The service was professional but slow and inattentive. For the price we shouldn't have to pour our own wine or wait 45 minutes between courses and the food should wow us as we would expect from the four Seasons....felt robbed by the time we left. Would not return."}
{"text":"Hubby took me here for date night recently and had such an enjoyable time, the service was very friendly and attentive, the lamb shank and veal was simply mouth watering, the only thing I didn't care for was the raw beef appetizer, the meat was very fatty which just resulted in an never ending chew.  The cocktails where delicious but man where they strong, we ended up ordering a separate glass of sprite to tone it down but in all honestly, we weren't complaining."}
{"text":"Pretty good, would expect more for how much it cost. Bread rolls were amazing. Lobster Mac was underwhelming. Sea bass was good. Our waiter was super nice! Overall, I think it was way over priced for quality of food."}
{"text":"My wife took me to Talavera's  for my birthday. We found the service in the bar and restaurant was exceptional. The Bison Steak, Chillan Sea Bass and Cream Brule were all delicious!"}
{"text":"We've been dining here for years and Talavera still grows on me. Love the view, and it's nice to dine in the company of people who still understand concepts like decorum and dressing for dinner.  I've never seen anyone here make fun of other diners, bring a bunch of loud children, drink to excess, look a mess and pretend it's everybody else's problem, or call negative attention to themselves in any way.  Talavera is a slightly different experience for me every time. It's very special."}
{"text":"Everything we had was delicious and well worth the money. Staff was attentive but did not pressure or rush us. The lamb and the bison are both great, and the other courses were up to par. It's a special treat for the money, but worth every penny and every minute that you're there."}
{"text":"Everything said about thus restaurant is positively true,great decor,fantastic views ,excellent service and food Sometimes it takes a little thing to disappoint I ordered a wedge salad and it was poorly prepared and  slightly larger than the size of a baseball Very annoying ,especially for $16.00 The steak was amazing as were the deserts The unique baked bread was really special  We will definitely return with friends"}
{"text":"Simply put, the finest dining experience of my life. We were seated by the window, which had a beautiful wall of fire just outside it. The service was perfect--great timing, attentive without hovering, good suggestions. Everything was perfect, from the wine to the gnocchi. I wish I could afford to eat there more often."}
{"text":"The view is absolutely breath taking! Watching the sunset over the mountains while having a decadent dinner was super romantic.  Chef Mel greeted our table and the service was superb. The servers were as excited talking about the food as we were to eat it.  We started with the foie gras. It was perfectly seared and the savoriness was nicely complimented by the sweetness of the peach pound cake and rhubarb chutney.  Next we got a seared scallop, compliments of the chef and servers. It's hard to find well executed scallops and these were superb! The sear on the outside had a nice crispness.  I had the Chilean sea bass. The kitchen definitely knows how to cook their fish. It was moist and flakey  with a good char. The potato risotto was on the cusp of being over seasoned but was silky and melted like butter.  My partner got the cut of the week which was a bone in filet. It was cooked to perfection. The squash and mole complimented it well. The lobster mac and cheese was made with havarti. It was deliciously creamy.  We got the chocolate soufflé for dessert. My partner really loved it. I am not a fan of chocolate but I can only imagine it's the stuff chocolate fanatics dream about.  Tip: during the summer go between six and seven to maximize the view. Watching the sky turn from blue to lavender to fire was awesome."}
{"text":"Amazing food and experience. I would highly recommend. They were exceptional in handling food allergies!!"}
{"text":"Great service, great drinks and great food, but we just didn't think it was worth $$$$.  The reality is that you can enjoy the same facilities and views at Four Seasons at their other restaurant (Proof), for half the price."}
{"text":"Once again, an outstanding and memorable dining experience at Talavera. From the smart wine pairings to the melt in your mouth seabass, my company and I were in complete bliss. Hospitality is their specialty at the Four Seasons and we were treated like VIPs from the minute we walked in the door. We started off with some very unique cocktails in the lounge, the new habanero mescal concoction is definitely not to be missed. I'm a sucker for a dirty martini. The ice cold Titos vodka with the briny blue cheese olives set my whole mood for the night --yah yah yah I was tipsy, don't judge me! We dined on the patio, which in my opinion is the best patio in Arizona. The scenery is beautiful with the mountains and sunset. Nightingales flew around the desert landscape after the sun went down. Precious!   The food as usual was beyond perfect. My party tried a bit of everything, but the favorite dishes were the ahi tuna appetizer, the lobster bisque, and of course the heavenly seabass. I dream about this meal during the year, so as much as I would like to stray and try something new for my entree, I have to have the seabass. The buttery potato gnocchi paired with the velvety fish is taken to a whole different level with the crispy, savory shreds of oxtail. Never in my life have I had such a perfect dish--and I've tried everything!  We ended the evening with pretty much every dessert on the menu. The hands down favorite here was the vanilla scented marscapone with the hibiscus berries--I WILL FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THIS. We had a tasting of fine Madeira wine which really sealed the deal. Some strong coffee to sober up and then we sadly ended our evening.   Thank you to the amazing team at Talavera. Our server Juan (pronounced like Wyclef Jean) was knowledgeable, funny, and more than accommodating. We were beyond spoiled for our family reunion. On a personal note, my uncle who joined us just beat cancer this last year and was able to travel from Minneapolis to see us for the first time in two years. You made the visit more than special, it was magical."}
{"text":"One of the top 10 dining experiences I have had.  Attentive service. Deliciously prepared foods with unique flavours. Everything was spectacular - from the custom prickly pear cocktail I requested, the way the cod was perfectly cooked, to the intriguing foie gras concoction, which had a foie gras ice cream sandwich, strawberry marshmallow, and foie gras on top of finely diced strawberries.  I like this place and would absolutely come back next time I'm in Scottsdale.  Emphatically Recommended!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow!! Service, food, the staff, the VIEW! Life!!!! Can't say enough amazing things about this place.  I'll be back next time I'm In town"}
{"text":"This place is so good that I'm starting to use it as a benchmark for other places we eat at!!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my husbands birthday here... Incredible meal, romantic atmosphere and great service! Our server, Josh, was very knowledgeable about the menu and offered great recommendations! He was very personable and attentive which made for an even better experienced! From the wine to the Octopus appetizer to the warm bread... To the Seabass and New York Strip... Everything was perfect! Would highly recommend the Seabass and lobster mac & cheese on the side! The views from the patio were incredible of the city lights and Pinnacle Peak. Even though it was a bit cold, the heaters worked extremely well and the temperature was perfect. After our dinner, we enjoyed live music in the bar outside to cap off a great date night. Would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"Great service, probably mostly good food. Did not care for the vegan pappardelle. For $29 it was a small plate of overcooked noodles in an extremely thick tomato sauce. Not appropriate for the noodle. They should have either gone for a white wine sauce with EVOO and garlic or a simple cashew cream sauce.   The tomato salad was divine!  Subpar wine selection. But what they DO have, is all excellent. Just wish there were more options. Also, expect to pay $20/glass on a bottle that is about $15 retail. Ouch!   Note to chef: Lay off the breadcrumbs dude. This isn't 2002."}
{"text":"The 1 star goes to the waiters that were very sweet and the view was breathtaking, other than that everything was horrible, my husband & I along with another couple decided to go there for Valentines Dinner, what a huge mistake that was, there was a fixed 5 course meal with absolutely no options or substitutes, usually fixed menus at least gives an option to choose between 2 or 3, but not this place. There was alot of dairy and pork on the menu, where my husband could not eat, so they tried to bring something else, but it was awful, we asked for bread, it was soft but they were simple dinner rolls, nothing special, in other words we just kept ordering more bread because the food was just plain nasty, i mean come on, one of the courses was a pear with mascarpone cheese inside, maybe there are a few people who may like that, but I know that majority would never order that, how can they add that to a fixed menu, its beyond me!!!! The main course was a steak, which was burnt but raw inside, i mean it was so chewy where my jaw started to hurt me, at that point I couldn't stay quiet anymore so I complained to the server and he seemed to sympathize with me, and gave me a look like I was not the 1st one to complain that night, another server said that their menu is so much better on a regular night, but that didnt matter to us because we were already there, they did try to compensate and brought out a few extra pieces of lobster but the worst part was ofcourse the bill, we paid wayyyyyy too much and I felt horrible because I made the reservations. Safe to say I will NOT be returning to that place, and I was veryyyy disappointed, probably would have had a better meal at McDonalds or something."}
{"text":"Wow - what a delicious & well-run event!  Thanksgiving Buffet 2017  Unbelievable & Unbeatable - I wonder if any restaurant buffet feast in the future could ever top this one for appeal ($110 ea). Beautifully displayed, yummy small plates, special & traditional entrees & sides. Service outstanding, seating schedule worked well - no stations or rooms were overwhelmingly packed, food stations were easy to access. Foods were arranged in a sensible manner.  We had a 3pm seating & sat outside with a bit of sun well-shaded with umbrellas. Thoroughly enjoyable."}
{"text":"We had a private dinner in what appears to be a wine refrigerator.  The sommelier popped in from time to time to retrieve a bottle.  He wasn't intrusive and it was actually kind of amusing.  Pashminas and blankets are provided for those who felt chilly.    Excellent seafood platter as a starter.  I devoured a healthy serving of foie gras and had a fabulous pork chop as my main.  We shared all the sides, gruyere potatoes are outstanding.  I was too full to sample the gorgeous pie but did partake of a light and tasty frozen lemon meringue strawberry dessert.  Oodles of delicious champagne and wine.  I was a bit suspect that I would find truly fine dining outside of major metropolitan cities but am happy to report I was wrong."}
{"text":"We had an awesome experience here! While on vacation we stayed at the four seasons.We found this place to be not only over the top in service but more than expected flavor on our meals. We had a spill of red wine at our table which could have been a tragedy(it is as for us) waiter took the meal that was splashed with red wine back and prepared a new one! They went above and beyond to make that situation better . They even brought out shout out wipes and tried to HELP I could not have treated any better. Great view too sky was beautiful"}
{"text":"Fantastic experience. Our group was big and we had reservations for I believe 9. We were sat promptly on the patio upon our arrival and were able to see the sunset. We stayed and ate for about 4 hours. Wait staff was great especially John. Food was all cooked perfectly and there wine selection was endless. Our 8 bottles did not disappoint !"}
{"text":"In November, Talavera at the Four Seasons in Scottsdale featured an exquisite menu created by the Long Meadow Ranch.  If you are not familiar with the Long Meadow Ranch it is a 650-acre historic ranch nestled high atop the Mayacamas Mountains above the Napa Valley. There they produce award-winning wines and handcrafted extra-virgin olive oils - as well as grass-fed beef, eggs, and heirloom fruits and vegetables.  Talavera is a gorgeous mountain-top restaurant and we were delighted to be seated on the patio.  Even before we were able to be wowed by the food, my dining companion and I were blown away by the dramatic view of Pinnacle Peak.  The patio was elegant and warm and was the perfect backdrop to our unforgettable meal.  Andre, our server, was the consummate professional.  He was friendly, informative and very available.  He explained each of our dishes and the coordinating wines.  He had a Caribbean charm and friendly nature that added not only to our meal, but to the whole experience.  We started our meal with an amazing bread that had been topped off with a wonderful Olive Oil created by the Long Meadow Ranch.  The olive oil added a slight salt flavor that was understated but amazing.  We tried as hard as we could to eat only one piece, so as not to spoil our dinner, but could not resist at least one more piece!  Our 1st course was a Goat Cheese tart with Caramelized Fennel topped with an arugula & radicchio salad dotted with a red wine gastrique.  I found the goat cheese to be delectable and the sweetness of the fennel matched with the tartness of the gastrique was phenomenal and amazing way to start the evening.  The 2008 Sauvignon Blanc that paired with this course was lush and a nice match to the goat cheese.  Our 2nd course was a Pomegranate Glazed Duck Breast over a Winter Squash Blini and paired with a 2005 Sangiovese.  The duck was so tender and rich that I would have been pleased had all the rest of the plates just re-featured this dish.  My companion had never tried duck before and she was in love after the first bite.  The blini added a nice change of texture and the full body and tinge of sweetness provided by the Sangiovese rounded out the dish quite nicely.  Our Entrée was an All Natural NY Strip medallion served with a Celery Root Gratin and Turnips & Nantes Carrots paired with a 2005 Ranch House Red.  The strip was topped with a lovely mushroom sauce and was cooked perfectly, slightly smoky and just the right temperature.  The celery root gratin was ridiculous.  It was akin to an Alfredo dish - creamy and delicate...absolutely amazing!  The turnips and carrots were nice too - but we next to the gratin there isn't much to say.  The dark and spicy notes of the Ranch House Red played right into the depth and flavors of the meat.  Dessert was a Molten Chocolate Cake served with a Cranberry Compote and Maple pecan Ice Cream paired with a 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon.  Now molten chocolate cake is good, but this was positively sinful.  The tart of the cranberry matched with the richness and depth of the chocolate almost made me weep...and I don't really care that much for chocolate.  The texture and cold of the maple pecan ice cream alongside the heat of the melted chocolate was simply brilliant.  By this point in the meal we were wishing for larger pants and someone to carry us to our car.  I have had some really great meals in my life - but this was one that I could savor and feel good about all at the same time.  I knew where each component of my meal came from and was provided with great service and attention all throughout our meal.  This was a wonderful experience and I encourage you to visit longmeadowranch.com to learn more about their services and practices as well as the great items they have for purchase.  As always, Talavera is a wonderful place for dinner whether on the intimate terrace or in the rustic and warm dining room, make sure they are on your list of Valley Must Eats!"}
{"text":"I went here on a date for Valentine's Day 2018 and had the four-course tasting menu. The ambience was great (live spanish guitar, spectacular view, cool outdoor fireplace).   However, the food was literally awful. There were two options for dinner - seafood paella and a steak dish. The seafood paella seemed as if it sat under a heating lamp for about 3 hours. It was dried out to the extent that the scallop was rubbery like an old shoe and the rice seemed uncooked. The steak dish was only a little better but the steak was far too gristly for a fillet at a fine dining establishment and the potatoes were cold. Our seating was at 8:30, so maybe we were at the tail end of a busy evening which is why the food was of such poor quality.   Despite the horrendous food, the atmosphere allowed us to have a great night. In fact, we were even able to joke about the fact that this was the worst $300 meal either of us had ever eaten."}
{"text":"This has been our go to place for fine dining since it opened. But last nights dinner was  poor. The rice in the paella was dry and the shellfish was over cooked and shriveled up. And the clams were sandy. The vegetable paella was lacking in vegetables and salty. This was a birthday dinner which I informed them when I booked and no mention was ever made that they were aware of this.  They need to kick it up a notch if they are going to charge $250 for a dinner for 2. Not sure we will go again. Only reason they get a 2 star is the staff were good and the views are great."}
{"text":"My vacation girl and I ate at Talavera for our \"last supper\", at the end of a very nice week's vacation.  As other Yelpers wrote, the view from the balcony seating was spectacular, and the restaurant itself is very nicely appointed.  Our waiter and server were both very nice and attentive.  We started off with the lobster & corn bisque and the BBQ glazed pork belly.  My pork belly was fall apart tender, and tasted really good with the cheddar grits that come with it.  My wife said that the bisque was o.k.  For the main, I had the hangar steak and my better half had the salmon.  This is one of those a la carte places, so if you want anything other than meat on your plate, you have to order it separately; we opted for gruyere mashed potatoes and asparagus with garlic butter.  My steak was done perfectly, and the chimichurri sauce on it was yummy.  I would've preferred to have the steak come in one piece, rather than pre-sliced, since this caused it to cool down by the time it got to the table.  My wife said that the salmon was fine, but didn't knock her out.  The potatoes and asparagus were o.k.  We skipped having a bottle of wine.  They have an extensive wine list, with various wines/champagnes going for upwards of $5-6K (yes, thousand!), and the cheapest was still about $50.  The tab was over $100 for everything, even without wine (no surprise), but we just weren't bowled over with everything we ate.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience. Did our reservations online and wrote this was my parents 50th wedding anniversary dinner. Our menus across the top stated this, such a thoughtful and sweet gesture. The head chef signed one and it was given back to my Mom with a beautiful bow. This will end up in her scrap book without a doubt. To write about the 3 appetizers, 5 meals and 3 desserts would take too long. I will mention the best. NY strip, scallops and chocolate soufflé. Everything from the duck to the buffalo was fabulous but those 3 were my favorites. All the staff were superb, our waiter was on spot. I love great waitstaff so I really appreciated them all. We sat at 530 so we enjoyed a great sunset. The location is beautiful and the overall feel is comfortable. The whole experience was great start to finish. The only odd thing was the music. DUB, techno and something similar my son called Trap was not really fitting for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Was awesome night.  the food was great, the views spectacular and the staf were great."}
{"text":"Had a great meal here on 4th of July....could see fireworks all across the Valley from our table, and had a superb meal.  I had heirlooms and burrata, to start, the filet mignon, and nice Pinot.  Every course was delicious, including the bread, and dessert was quite a pleasant experience.  The croquettes were borderline life-changing (in a good way), as were the hazelnut, chocolate creme lollipops that came with the check.  Waitstaff was classic 4S in terms of hospitality, and seemed like quite bunch of foodies themselves."}
{"text":"The lamb shank was inedible, 70 to 80% fat.  Service was very uneven, we Felt we were pressured to order entrees before the appetizers arrived.  All six entrees were delivered to the wrong person,  a real no, no for any restaurant, much less a Four Seasons restaurant.  My wife had to ask for a glass of ice 3 times with no result.  We finally flagged a manager who took care of it."}
{"text":"The best meal, best service, and view... perfect. We got the 6 course chef's meal, and it was exquisite"}
{"text":"Everyone has that fantasy meal, the one you think about when you are chowing down that nice healthy bowl of oatmeal.  Well Talavera has that fantasy dish and can clearly get me through a bowl of oatmeal, let me explain....   If I took your finger and had you blindly point it to anything on Talvera's menu you would succeed in choosing an excellent meal.  Every course of food was excellent here.  I personally had a salad here that I will never forget.  Yes fresh figs and candied pecans on greens made a nice mix.  The delicious short rib main course with crab meat mash potatoes.  Finally the creme brulee with open flame to caramelize the top.  What a play on visual and taste appeal.    As for the location, nicely appointed on the mountains so that the outdoor seating is a must here.  Nice views of Phoenix and the mountains and this must be put on your list to take a special someone here.  If you are looking for a place that you can enjoy the views, eat excellent food, and share with someone you love please take them here.  You will have a great experience and great memories."}
{"text":"We decided instead of watching the Oscars that we would treat ourselves to our own red carpet dinner. What a great choice. Dinner was fantastic. Had the scallops and they were so good. Also had the lobster mac and cheese and it was delicious. My husband had the bison fillet wrapped in bacon. He enjoyed it.  Our server Josh was so friendly and his attention to detail was on point. He made us feel like we were the only ones in the restaurant. He took the time to explain everything we were eating and cared if we were going to enjoy it. We had a beautiful evening and the ambience was amazing."}
{"text":"So we had Xmas eve dinner with some friends at Talavera @ The Four Seasons.  The Con's:  * The décor of the 4 Seasons really needs to be updated, the whole SW territorial thing is a bit 2008, Feels like a nursing home.  * We were seated at the bastard step child's table. Pretty sure it was a folding card table, and the chairs were out of their conference room. The rest of the diners all had great tables and nice seating. Seemed really odd.  * The waitress had such a heavy accent no one could understand her. The next waiter wasn't much better, he went around the table taking orders, then left without one person having ordered. He returned about 10 minutes later and apologized for missing the last order.  * The food presentation is really weak. It tries to pull off the whole gourmet artsy thing but misses by a mile. Hard to take cafeteria food and pull that look off. The bread I was pretty sure it was out of one of the Pillsbury dough tubes you mom used to make. The salad was real weak. The entrée could have been alright, but the cheap tasting BBQ sauce they drowned it in over powered any taste of the actual meat.  * Desert wasn't much better, the coffee was great thought, so I am giving them that.   The Pro's:  * It is close to our home.  Sorry, really trying to give them something but it's nearly I possible. I would never return. I find it hard to believe that a 4 seasons could be this bad. We have stayed at quite a few of the brands resorts and always been happy. The good thing was that our company was great and it made the evening enjoyable. Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"Yum! We were here for Restaurant Week, and the mister was definitely glad he forgot to make reservations elsewhere.   Sat down at their last available table outside and noticed a couple near the edge getting ready to leave. We mentioned it to our hostess and were told that we could move momentarily. Awesome! Our table was quickly snatched up as soon as we moved, so their willingness to accommodate us was appreciated.   Love their little plate with an assortment of water flavorings. Cucumber, lemon, and lime slices - one of each per guest at the table.   Started out with the beet salad. So good! The candied pecans had the perfect amount of cinnamon in the glaze. The mister had the lobster bisque. He was a little disappointed that there wasn't more lobster (only one decently-sized piece in the bowl), but liked it well enough.   They took our drink orders before bringing the first course, and when I ordered two different glasses at different times, the server (maybe the somm? A different server than the one who took our orders) knew which courses I had ordered and clarified the foods. Top notch service right there.   We added on the beef carpaccio appetizer between the first course and our entrees. It was good, but not quite what I was expecting. Their seven-minute fried egg didn't live up to my expectations. Very little yolk still runny, plus the breading was a little off-putting. I don't like breaded and subsequently fried foods, but the man wasn't sold on it either. Didn't get the hype there. The chive cream was an EXCELLENT compliment, and the mustard was delicious, though a little overpowering.   My lamb shank entree was strangely sweet and not what I was looking for, but the farro accompaniment was outstanding. I left meat on the bone, but hoovered all the farro. So good. The beef medallions were spectacular! Perfectly done, tender, and juicy. I was almost regretting not ordering the beef for myself.   For dessert, I had ordered the semifreddo, and was served the icebox cake. Not sure if this was a mixup on their part or not, but it was still tasty and I never mentioned anything to the contrary. The grapefruit was a strange choice next to the chocolate and caramel, as the caramel overpowered it, but the cake itself was so tasty it didn't really matter. The frozen yogurt came out with a plentiful serving of gorgeous, fresh berries. Both of us were happy there.   The cappuccino after dessert came with cubed sugar, and they allowed us to grab the cup and go walking around the grounds.   $150 before tip, with Restaurant Week pricing. I probably would've been happier if I would have spoken up about the lamb, but we'll be back. Great food and excellent service."}
{"text":"Oh Ma Gawd! Samantha needs to get her sweet little ass to Talavera. Then she would have her best meal so far. This certainly ranks as one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. From the lobby of the masculine Four Seasons (like Ralph Lauren masculine, not Martina Navratilova masculine) to the bar to our own private dining room, everything was simply outstanding.   Chef Frank Robertson had prepared a special seven course meal for our party, we just had to select our own entree and the decision was agonizing. I went with lobster served with corn, baby squash and cabbage. Perfection! Preceding my entree we had three amuse bouche; Blue Fin Tuna Poke, Sesame, Avocado ; Heirloom Tomato and Burrata, Basil, Orange Olive Oil, Balsamic and I'll be darned if I don't remember the third.   Did I mention we had predinner cocktails? Belvedere and freshly squeezed grapefruit juice for me and a round of Absolut LA drinks for most of the others. And the wine. It was pouring like Morton salt. My favorite was a Carneros Pinot Noir. Like drinking liquid velvet! Other foodies raved about the filet, the scallops and the sea bass. Prices for entrees ran from high 20s to mid 40s. Worth every penny. Dessert for us were several plates of sweets...small pieces of various delights from truffles to cakes and pecan bites. I felt like Lucy on the chocolate factory line. Dare I say I stashed a few in my cleavage for the ride home?   Misc: Service was five stars all the way. Thanks to all who made our party special. The long fire \"pit\" outside is fabulous. Views of the Valley....uh...maze...ing! Cloth handtowels in the restrooms. Nice touch. Cotton is afterall the fabric of our lives.  Chocolate does tend to melt when nestled between your shirt and your chest.   Cheers my yelpitas. Here's to a fabulous winter in Arizona!"}
{"text":"I came to Four seasons to have dinner at Talavera, I had made reservations for my boyfriend and i had to request a special dish for me, being a vegetarian and all. The chef did a phenomenal job.   The sunset was stunning as we ate dinner. It was breathtaking and so was our booth. My boyfriend had a steak and he said it was delicious and was cooked to a medium rare perfection. There was a little order mishap but was quickly and professionally resolved. Dessert we had fruit tart. GET IT. *HAPPY DANCE*  Overall we enjoyed our dinner great customer service. we'll be back and hopefully we stay at the hotel as well."}
{"text":"Impressive! Great menu with tantalizing ambiance. Sat by the fire and made for a spectacular evening. My wife had the wedge salad and I had the lobster and corn chowder. Both were regally presented. Nice collection of wines and a great assortment of craft beers. Lobster was mediocre, a bit chewy based on the bite that my wife gave me. Veal porterhouse melt in my mouth. Overall one of the better restaurants I went to on my tour of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"OMG one of the best restaurants in town has changed their menu and hit rock bottom. Best thing- the views. The elegance is gone. The delicious food of the past is gone. The signature sea bass-gone. Never minded spending close to $300 for two in the past for great food and experience. Those days are also -GONE. After they changed chefs it slipped a little, now it has taken a huge plunge!!!"}
{"text":"Ambiance on a Fall evening is amazing. Was introduced to the restaurant courtesy of Phoenix Restaurant Week. Our entire party of 5 thoroughly enjoyed the food. The service was first rate. Would highly recommend and I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I ordered the filet medium rare and it came medium well. My wife ordered the lamb medium rare and it came our super rare (and half of it was fat). Service was slow too. Stay away."}
