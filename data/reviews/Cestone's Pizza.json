{"text":"Had dinner yesterday at Cestone's Restaurant. Good food, good service and available off-street parking. Would definitely recommend Spinach and Garlic pizza."}
{"text":"Really solid small town pizza place. Really inexpensive and great bang for your buck. Me and my family were visiting Pittsburgh for the night and stopped in for a quick bite before taking a ride on the Duquesne incline. The crust was incredible and the toppings were really tasty. Great beer selection with tons of local options as well as some imports.
Not a place to go if your looking for a classy evening but great if you're looking to grab a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"This place is quality!

... in that it has an indistinguishable quality that, I think, is what makes it bad. It wasn't horrible, just mediocre, but had some sort of ingredient or something that made us stop and think, \"hm, no.\"

Also, I think that mysterious quality was what gave me the overwhelming urge to wear stretchy pants and try not to vom. 

I'm sorry Cestone's! I wanted to like you, you sell pizza by the slice and you're close to my house, but it's just not going to work out."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for almost two years now, the pizza is decent I love their sauce!  They have big \"slices\" so watch out!  A slice from this place is 2 normal sized slices together so it's great for a lunch break or something really quick if you're in the go. 

They have beer here I mean what's not to love about that?!  The bottles are all 2.50 except the 40s. You can buy a six pack or single bottles.  

In the spring/summer they have outdoor seating, benches and tables under umbrellas and the staff is super friendly!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat pizza in Pittsburgh. A great neighborhood pizzeria that also has reasonably priced beer ready and cooled in the fridge. I really like the quality of their vegetables, especially the spinach. They also put fresh minced garlic on the pizza which is a must-get.

In addition, the staff is awesome and is a great staple of the neighborhood. In my last time visiting the restaurant, I saw the workers take in a kid who had been left alone and was lost at the bus stop after school. They gave him a free soda, small pizza and put cartoons on the television while contacting the child's mother and watching him until she got there.

Not only is this place a great restaurant but a positive impact to my community! Love this place."}
{"text":"Delicious. They have made to order or sell by the slice. Lots of options for calzones and other types but I've never ordered them because the pizza is so good. Inexpensive and large slices. They don't have jalape√±os and they don't deliver which is a bummer. There is also a large beer selection."}
{"text":"This place is small but it is quick and the pizza is decent.  My family of four ate for under $20.  The woman behind the counter was nice and accommodating for my kids (extra plates, napkins, etc.)  We will definitely be back when looking for something cheap and quick!  They also had some picnic tables outside that would be nice in good weather."}
{"text":"Good neighborhood pizza spot. Cestone's always hits the spot for a quick pizza. They have huge slices if u order by the slice. There's better pizza and fancier pizzas out there, but Cestones is a great neighborhood pizza place. It's my go to place when hosting a party or the day after a party."}
{"text":"I get a traditional pineapple and onion pizza every time and my god is it delicious! They used clumps of pineapple instead of slices or little chunks and something about it makes all the difference in the world. I will say that the employees are not the friendliest but if they keep making great pizza, I don't care how standoffish they are to me!"}
{"text":"Great antipasto.  Easily enough for 3 people. Pizza is just ok for my taste."}
{"text":"Nice place to grab a take out pizza. They have brew too! 

This is a good NY style pizza that doesn't get to complicated with trying to make the process art like. They take good ingredient and make good pizza. 

Definitely a under utilized pizza joint due to their location. If they had been on Shiloh or Grandview they would be packed. 

Give this place a shot and you wont be disappointed.  

The two times I have been here the size has been a little on the smaller side but maybe I went on some bad nights. I seen other reviews that said their portions are really big."}
{"text":"This isn't my favorite pizza in the Burgh, but I do really like it! It's way more affordable than a lot of the pizza shops in Pittsburgh, and I've never been disappointed with the quality. They're also super quick. Usually if I am craving pizza, I am craving pizza NOW, so I appreciate that fact. They also have a cooler with pop and beer - yay!

I recently discovered that their $8 salads are MASSIVE. We ordered an antipasto to go with our sausage pizza and I have to say, I was floored with how huge the thing was. We were actually laughing because there were so many more toppings than lettuce - normally the topping to lettuce ratio swings in the other direction, so way to go, Cestone's. To note, this is your typical \"Pittsburgh\" salad, loaded up with cheese. So if you're expecting that salad = healthy, in this case, that might not actually be true.

I love to sit out back when the weather is cooperative, but Cestone's is always great for takeout too. The one negative in my book is that they don't deliver. Womp :("}
{"text":"The pizza and calzones here are very good! And the prices can't be beat. I was shocked the first time I went. It's also nice that they have ice cream.

The picnic benches outside are nice, and they recently added some parking across the street, which was much needed and I think is a nice addition.

I knocked off a star because I had a bad experience with an employee once (she did end up apologizing, but still)... And I also wish they delivered."}
{"text":"I have had pizza take out here twice.  Both times it was fine.  Quick, not too expensive, and pretty good take out pizza.  If I need a quick pizza I will go back, but if I want a fancy gourmet pizza, I may try a different spot."}
{"text":"Believe it or not, the best thing about Cestone's is their ice cream, which like Darren said, resembles a mousse in taste and texture. It's really thick and holds up well in the heat. The pizza was pretty good. My burger was a little dry, though. The regulars are \"nebby\" as Pittsburghers say but are nice."}
{"text":"Jonesing for a slice away from home I came across this family owned local gem. Reminded me of the neighborhood pizzerias in Brooklyn where I grew up that are now laden in granite and marble like a mausoleum, what a shame. Anyway, tasty crispy pepperoni slice, especially for Pittsburgh, They cut them in half here, so it feels like 2, only they charge you for 1. Nice! Had the Cherokee cherry soda and a superman ice cream. All that for less than 5 bux? Maddone!! What's a superman ice cream? I dunno but it was good."}
{"text":"Typical neighborhood pizza place, but it does the job! It's a cute little shop with sidewalk seating and ice cream window in the summer. The inside isn't anything special but it seems clean. The staff is busy but not unfriendly. Usually though, we order delivery. It comes within the normal amount of time and the pizza is good."}
{"text":"The sky was a spurned lover, sobbing angrily, dejectedly as Kay and I tried to find dinner on our way home one evening last week. The renovation of the Liberty Tunnels forced us to make a detour through Mount Washington. Combing through my memory banks, I was able to recall the name of one of the hilltop neighborhood's mainstay pizzerias: Cestone's. From there, our trusty GPS led us towards shelter and nourishment. 

Framed posters of Broadway shows populated the scenery along with cherry-red seats that looked to have been pilfered from a demolished stadium or arena. Amicable, nosy, world-weary regulars loafed about the dining room, dying for someone to conversate with about anything or nothing at all, watching our every movement. So inquisitive were they that I was reluctant to snap photos. The images I did manage to capture were done on the sly. 

I started off with a half-hoagie that I would have enjoyed more had there been more meat to chew on. 

The stinginess of that subpar sub was forgotten once our Kay Kombo pizza slid onto our table on a dented grey disc. What I found most striking about this pie was the crust which while crunchy on the very bottom was rather plush in the center. Chewy bits of savory bacon dotted a landscape rendered manna-like by a smooth mozzarella and sweet by a vibrant sauce. While watching the droplets batter the pavement outside from the heavens and listening to the patrons remark on \"that there storm,\" Kay and I quietly dined, thankful that the weather diverted the attention of the \"nebby\" patrons away from us, the people they didn't know. 

Cestone's (pronounced 'sess-tone's') surprisingly excels at soft serve ice cream, something I thought DiFiore's had a lock on in this part of town. Whether they use a pre-fabricated mix or their own concoction (is whipped topping folded into it?), I haven't any proof, but never before have I had a soft-serve ice cream that came off as so much luscious mousse. Beyond a mere custard, the dairy product fell, slithered into a paper cup, coiling like a vanilla/chocolate serpent. The whipped aerosol foam and microwaved hot fudge were not only immaterial, they were almost in the way. 

Just as we paid our check, the downpour halted, and the local folk went back to their lives, watching us leave, nudging each other, pointing to us curiously while we jogged to the Kaymobile, likely asking each other if they recognized us from somewhere.

\"I wonder if that's Elsie's nephew or Donny's boy? You know, the big, bald kid? The cop!\"

\"Oh, I dunno. The girl kinda looked familiar, though.\"

Cestone's is one of those Pittsburgh eateries that exists out of time and remains unfazed by trends, renewal, or upheaval. May it stand proudly without giving a crumb over what anyone else thinks of it.

P.S. If it reads like I was slagging the neighborhood people for whom Cestone's is obviously a hangout, I wasn't really. They were actually amusing, harmless, and surely well-meaning. We were both just feeling beaten up from work and weren't much in the mood for chit-chat that evening."}
{"text":"I could talk about how great this place is for hours, but I'll keep it relatively short for those of you rushing to find a good place to eat. I'm a regular and I've had it all. This pizza has a perfectly crafted crispy/soft crust and tastes amazing. The ice cream is amazing as other reviews have mentioned (get a chocolate milkshake). Great hoagies (steak or hot sausage are the best). They also have gyros, fries, chicken, salads and burgers, so something for every mood. But the best part of this place is that it's a great place to hang out and drink a beer with friends in one of Pittsburgh's most charming neighborhoods."}
{"text":"Another average neighborhood pizzeria. Nothing fantastic. The Super Bowl party I went to had ordered from Cestone's. Although my special vegan super bowl chili was the hit of the party, well only until the Patriots lost, but that's another story.

Where Cestone's shines is their Ice Cream window, open during the summer months. They also have a hot dog cart and sidewalk seating. Great ice cream!"}
{"text":"Pizza is whatever, girl proceeded to use her bare hands without washing them to prepare the slice, crust was soggy on bottom, looked around for the restaurant grade and it was nowhere to be found  Improve the pizza quality and have employees wear food preparation gloves and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I watched the pizza shop zip through a rush without breaking a sweat. They were courteous and attentive. The pizza was deliciouse and exactly what i was craving. I will return frequently."}
{"text":"My wife and I live very close to Cestone's.  Their pizza is very good, and the ingredients are fresh.  The downside is that the do not deliver.  Their prices are more than reasonable, and might be the cheapest pizza you can find in Mount Washington."}
