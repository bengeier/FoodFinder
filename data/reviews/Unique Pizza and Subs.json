{"text":"They have been opened since May '09, but I just found them a couple of weeks ago through Restaurant.com. I originally wasn't going to eat here because there is already a lot of pizza and sub restaurants around town. But after reading over their menu, there were several things that sounded really good, so we tried it. Am I ever glad we did.   I don't know about the pizza - even though I overheard one of the customers saying his pizza was \"really good\". My wife and I had two sub sandwiches....and Oh My was it GOOD! We both got a \"pounder\" sandwich, which is a pound of meat and cheese on a 12 inch roll. I got the BBQ Beef - one pound of steak with BBQ sauce, cheese and onion rings. My wife got the \"qualifier\" - one pound of steak with provolone and tomato. They give you a big basket of fries to go with it!   The fries were not so good, but the sandwich was one of the best we've had. Very soft bread and TENDER steak with no fat or gristle. It was more than we could eat - but we tried!!!   The only downside was the wait. They cook the steak when you order, so it is fresh and hot - but it took almost 30 minutes to get our food. Next time we will call ahead."}
{"text":"Neat to try. Real fatty and shameful. Cheap blue moon pitcher. This isn't a classy pizza place and the quality shows it, but if you made it you would be proud of yourself. Menu has eyebrow raising selections. Pretty cool to tell your friends about. A couple times I went and had to wait at the counter for someone to come out. They were nice when they showed up. Hard to see from the street. Keep your eyes peeled. Its kind of near Mimi's Cafe."}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing!!!!!! We had the buffalo chicken with garlic and a pitcher of beer! Def coming back here"}
{"text":"Stopped by here with husband for lunch because we had a restaurant.com certificate.  This was a surprisingly good pizza.  I had the veggie pizza and husband had pepperoni.  While the crust wasn't anything special, the sauce and the cheese were fantastic.  They used very good quality ingredients, and this might be one of the better pizzas I've had since I moved here.  With the restaurant.com certificate we only paid 13 bucks for two medium pizzas, which were huge.  Lots of leftovers.  The only reason why I didn't give this place five stars was a mishap with a new employee on the tab where we were overcharged for a few things, but ultimately the food won us over.  They also have insanely cheap pitchers of their beer on tap, for maybe 6 dollars (it could have been cheaper, I don't remember).  And the beer choices weren't just cheap crap like coors.  They had Blue Moon for that price too, which was a steal."}
