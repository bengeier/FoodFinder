Can down on an excursion with the work folks in the hunt to find new joints. We wanted to try some Hoagies!

The place is quite small but we called in and the owner was nice enough to keep the big table for us. We all barged in and and he started making the food in front of us. 

I ordered the Eggplant Parmesan Hoagie with their large fries. I would say I did enjoy the sandwich and it was filled up quite nicely. The fries were crispy and fresh out of the fryer. I also got to try their cheese stick which were okay, it was just plain cheese breaded with no flavour. 

Overall, decent adventure."}
{"text":"Great little sandwich spot! Friendly staff, tasty Philly Steak.  2 sandwiches, onion rings (lightly breaded) and 2 pops for less than $20!  I had the Philly Steak, and my GF had the 12\" Salami. The Salami was almost too much for her, and mine was just tight!  Looking forward to another visit. Too bad I don't work around the corner anymore, I'd be in there weekly."}
{"text":"Fantastic little eatery. Had the Philly Steak. Veggies were cooked beautifully and the BBQ sauce was spot on. Well done Sam! Mozzarella sticks where nice and crispy. 

Clean and friendly environment. Will be back with a hungry stomach!!"}
{"text":"This was a pleasant random just eat order.
I woke up without any desire to cook and oddly enough was craving grilled cheese (At 3:30p.m. *guilty sleep in after 3, 12hrs shifts lol)... 
This place delivered... literally, I was able to purchase some choice sandwiches and sides and have them delivered to my door. Thank you, thank you for this.
My bf and I tried

Grilled Cheese- 5/5
Philly Cheese Steak - 4/5
Meatball Hoagie- 4/5
Sausage Hoagie- 4/5
Poutine-5/5
Onion rings-5/5

My only dislike was the bread. I prefer a nice soft egg based bread as opposed to the hard buns these come in (but I also know a soft bun makes for soggy sandwiches ever so often), however it in no way took away from the overall experience... the meat, generous toppings (Green peppers, mushrooms and saut√©ed onions) and flavour was all there and made for an enjoyable experience.

My personal fave was the Grilled cheese sandwich and the Philly cheese steak."}
{"text":"Not too sure what the rave over this place is all about. Headed there with a friend after reading the great reviews, and we ordered the fried chicken hoagie and grilled vegetable with feta hoagie. The prices were very decent so no complaints there, but the sandwiches themselves lacked flavor and overall didn't make for a tasty meal. Good place to try, but not something I would get again."}
{"text":"First vist. All homemade food. 
Fast. Sam and his wife are awesome 
We had the meatball hoagie and chicken souvlaki. Delicious"}
{"text":"Sam's is a wonderful breakfast and sandwich joint. The environment is really friendly, the prices are great, and the food is absolutely delicious. I hope Sam's is here to stay for a long time.

As a side note I'd highly recommend their Philly cheese steak. Best in Brampton hands down."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for a sandwich, found this bare bones shop not too far, walked in, some tables available to eat, Kitchen was well equipped and they offered large variety of Breakfast, Hogies, Sandwiches and Burgers. Sides were the usual Fries, Rings, Poutine etc.
 
I had the Sam's Philly Steak, was served in a panni bun, was not stuffed full as previous pics on here, but was okay in terms of filling. The Sandwich itself was tasty, meat used was good, not fatty, bun was toasted which added flavor and was not soggy (good thing). 

Had the Rings on the side, they were hand made and looked good, but were quite oily, as if the fryer was not hot enough, they also tasted of fish which was a little off putting. 

Overall, this is a well priced sandwich shop with lots of choices, The owner has been in the business fir quite some time and it shows. Friendly owners and staff, I would definitely return and try the other items. Would definitely recommend this place to others over other fast food sandwich shops, better quality and taste for same price."}
