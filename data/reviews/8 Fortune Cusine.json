{"text":"this place is AMAZING!  the sizzling rice soup is out of this world.  crisp, fresh veggies, chicken, & jumbo shrimp in a PHENOMENAL broth.  probably the best broth i've ever tasted.  my in-laws took my fiance and i for dinner there, and it was fabulous.  wonderful service, fresh food, and a very tidy space.  i can't wait to go back.  i hope they never close!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Chinese food I have ever had!  It's served hot, fresh and made to order!  Maggie is so sweet!  She always makes sure everything tastes great!  We have never had a bad experience here!  The best egg drop soup I have ever tasted!  Avoid all those other places and check out 8Fortune!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"After being seated we waited about 30 minutes for the one waitress to bring our menus, the place was not busy at all. If you like eating sloppy wet rice with sauce I would suggest to you their fried rice.the waitress is nice but very slow and the food is average at best."}
{"text":"I made an account just to warn people...This is absolutely revolting. I have not met a chinese place i didn't like. But oh man. Fried rice is literally...fried rice with tiny specs of egg in it. It tasted like nothing...well rice..fried in oil i guess.  The beef was totally horrific. It was slimy and sort of rubbery.  The chicken was almost edible, and honestly the best part was the carrots and water chestnuts. The 6 dollars, for 6 beef on a sticks was totally blubbery, wet and not at all edible. They forgot 1 of 2 fried rice containers, which is fine really, because my two year old was the only one who would touch the fried rice anyway, then it was tossed. 30 dollars for 2 gross entrees and fried rice that is tasteless, plus 6 nasty wet beef hunks on a stick. Totally not worth it. Seriously, order anywhere else."}
{"text":"Overall I would not eat here unless it was the only thing open and i was starving!!! I would order something I know had to be made fresh... We gave them a couple chances and every time the food tasted like it was out for hours -if not an entire day. Especially the lo mein :("}
{"text":"This is the worst food in Arizona. My g.f. And I went there to fulfill a craving for Chinese food. Only one car in the parking lot. First clue. Pu Pu platter was well portioned but soaked in grease! Everything we tried tasted like grease. Egg roll grease soaked through two napkins, the placemat, and a 3 inch diameter around the egg roll. YIKES!!!! Ordered the house chicken and orange chicken. Both entrees were flavorless and greasy. Lots of food but horrible flavor. It was the most disgusting meal I have ever eaten. Sadly this experience cost me $26 because I couldn't bare to argue over how bad the food is. Paid - left- went to costco for a hotdog. Sadly the hotdog seemed gourmet after my bad \"fortune\"."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. They are so kind here and always customize our order perfectly.  They remember me by name, too!  We really like the fried rice with shrimp and the House Chicken - A word of advice is you are getting delivery - order your sauce on the side for the house chicken that way it will be crispy!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I just happened onto this place today and we loved it!  I had the lemon chicken and he had curried beef.  The lunches were $5.25 each and included soup, egg rolls and crab puffs, as well as fried rice.  I ha the egg drop soup and it was delicious, made with a light touch, not that salty canned chicken soup base.  Likewise the lemon chicken, first time I ever thought the sauce was not overly sweet.  My hubby had similar compliments on his meal.  The only reason I gave it four stars was because we did not care for the fried rice or the iced tea.  I was shocked that the place was largely empty at lunch time.  Go there! The food is great, and the prices are beyond reasonable, and it's a sit down place, no icky, picked over buffet."}
{"text":"I have been plesantly surprised by the quantity and quality of the food that is served at this restaurant! I recently ordered the Kung Pao Beef during lunch this past Monday (11/25/13) and it was DELICIOUS! I recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"After Pink Lotus closed on 35th & Union, we started the frustrating process of finding our new Chinese food place. The awesome service, large portions of delicious food, and clean dining room just made this our new favorite spot! Very kid friendly and very reasonable! $5.25 for a lunch special that includes entree, rice, soup, wanton/eggroll/crab puff. And $8.95 for a HUGE dinner that includes all of the aforementioned sides. The mongolian beef was so tender and the egg drop soup is the best we've had in town. The only thing we would change is the large amount of 5 spice in the lo mein but otherwise have no complaints! We'll definitely visit again. And soon!"}
{"text":"I used to love coming here until I came to pick up food for my office building and the staff on the clock didn't know how to use the register and could only accept cash. I had to sit for 20 minutes to wait for the manager to come back from wherever they were to take my card. Thanks, now my food is cold."}
{"text":"The egg drop soup was so tasteless and bland. I was sipping water. The cashew chicken was alright but lacking in a lot of flavor and ingredients."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food in town.  I try them all, this one is a cut above the rest.  I had the BBQ Pork and it was so GOOD!  Give it a try and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and selection overall. Came in during a weekday so it wasn't busy at all. Some of the entrees are good, some are a little less than expected quality for the price. The environment seems a bit subpar and a typical generic Chinese restaurant. The food will get the job done and satisfy that hunger! Try it!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty clean and quite. I always go at dinner time and its never veey loud or rowdy. Love the walnut shrimp here. Its not overly sweet. The singapore noodles are pretty good too. The staff is nice and the prices aren't too bad. Best chinese food ive had in the area. Beats china grill across the street."}
{"text":"Nice place and people were very friendly. An extensive menu all very well priced.  I had the Singapore Noodles and they were delicious. Some of the best I've ever had. The portion size was incredible. I took more than half home.    My Mom got a dinner combo and it could have fed 3 people  again very well priced   If you live in Peoria and want to support local, give these folks a try!"}
{"text":"If you're into poor quality Chinese food, this is the place for you.  I'm use to eating real Chinese food and then some pretty decent stuff in California.  The lemon chicken is the only thing on the menu that's okay.  Not good, but okay.  The food smells really bad, which means it isn't kept properly or prepared right.  The people with good reviews for this place have no taste buds."}
{"text":"Zero stars is what is deserved for this place. The food looked and tasted bad. I cannot believe the reviews that claim this is the best Chinese food ever. I encourage those Yelpers to seek out other Chinese restaurants for comparison. You are missing a lot of really good Chinese food.   Upon further review of the business with the Maricopa Co Environmental Services Dept (Health Dept), the business consistently has numerous priority violations. According to the county's website, a PRIORITY VIOLATION is a major violation that directly contributes to increasing the risk of foodborne illness or injury. (See photo added)  Do yourself a favor and stay far far away from 8 Fortune Chinese Cuisine."}
{"text":"I'll always love this place. The only bitches that'd complain are ones that raise their pinkys when taking a sip. Lol gtfoh! This place rocks!!"}
{"text":"I am handicapped and a dialysis patient as well and cannot drive on days I have a session. I got onto the website and it said delivery so we ordered the items we wanted and then when I was checking out with the address and info it says NO DELIVERY.Put in a future date for delivery,What I am going to wait for several days to get my order. On one of the back pages it list the days they deliver Fri-Sun only as of right now the delivery is closed,That info should have been on the front page when I clicked on delivery.Thankfully (The China Grill on 75th Delivered)...Fortune says . We wont be calling back here anytime soon"}
{"text":"This place was call Yu's when it opened. If you want to read the reviews look them up. I believe this place sold a year ago as there was new people at that time. The menu has not changed and the food seems to still be prepared fresh and with quality ingredients. One order will feed two people easy. We usually just get one meal and split it unless we want something in the refrigerator to eat during the week.The lady that is behind the  counter is super nice and helpful. We eat there a couple times a month and when people are in town we always take them there once during their stay. This is a local owned business and they do a great job. If you are in for Chinese give them a try."}
