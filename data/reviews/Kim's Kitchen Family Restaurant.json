{"text":"First visit.  The plate lunches are of the sort often seen in small town family cafes, certainly well-prepared, and not over-cooked as is common.  Wait staff are pleasant and helpful.  The dining area is roomy, clean, homey. 

TVs may have Bonanza playing, so you can imagine you're eating on a TV table in your den at home!

We enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"They are now back open, as of 04/01/17, as Kim's Kitchen.  My wife and I visited them last week, and it was as good as ever."}
{"text":"Kim's Kitchen is a Stanley icon of several decades. This is the one place I crave when it's been a while since I've visited. I've eaten cheeseburgers across America--and Kim's has always had the very best. The tender beef, melty cheese and fresh toppings are unmatched! Everything at Kim's is delicious--including all the country cooking meat-and-three specials. And you'll always get a friendly welcome from the owners and other regulars. Kim's helped create a love of food in me as a young boy--and that love has grown and grown as I've gotten older. I can't say enough great things about this place or its people!"}
{"text":"Delicious and cheap! Great customer service! Kim was very friendly and social to all her customers. Definately will be back the next time I stay in Charlotte!"}
