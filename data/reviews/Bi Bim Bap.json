{"text":"Afte reading about this place in an alumni newsletter, I went here on a night for a quick dinner and loved their korean tacos.

However, I kept adding their kimchi to it as well (here's a few menu improvement idea).

Good place, slightly above-price-range for other Korean food in North York (e.g. vs Yonge-Finch area) but atmosphere and customer service levels make up for that."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. She was so nice. When we came in, it wasn't that busy.  it was almost closing lol. It was my first time so i asked what can she recommend. & she was right. I tried the mushroom bibimbap i guess? It was veggies, then beef with some mushrooms idk how they call it. But it was really good. cheap and filling at the same time.  for sure, i'm coming back whenever i'll pass by eglinton."}
{"text":"I'm a new convert to Korean food so I can't claim any expertise. All I can say is the stone bowl dishes here are delicious. I've had the bi bim bap tofu and bi bim bap beef. What their secret is I don't know but everything just tastes so fresh, delicate and flavourful."}
{"text":"Took a chance on this place and all its good reviews bringing my hard to please foodie family .  At first was nervous because the atmosphere leaves something to be desired as my brother said \" it has the ambience of a high school cafeteria\"  however after we ate everyone left happy and smiling. Manages somehow to cater to the health conscious vegan ( me),  The stickler for traditional (my dad) , the trendy kid (my brother), the doesn't really like asian food , would  rather be at  \"Jerusalem's\" across the street, picky eater  ( my mom) and the classic carnivore (my boyfriend).   We all got various BIBIMBAPS as our mains, the kimchi fries omg the kimchi fries, Some tofu and noddle dishes, and the fruit salad as well as dumplings and kalibi. Fun for the whole family 10/10.


** veggie options 
I keep vegan and my mom is vegetarian. Lately it seems restaurants are offering less and less veggie options. My only guarantee is a specialty restaurant but socially it is hard because my family and friends like meat. Every time I have gone for dinner at a Korean place I have had a bowl of steamed rice and side of pickles awkwardly brought by a waiter who has nothing else to offer. At this place they do not just have one vegan option they have a bunch.  I was so sick of never really having Korean food because of my diet restrictions; now I have!"}
{"text":"You can make it as spicy as you want. Great service.  Definitely give it a try.
Parking on the street or green P close by."}
{"text":"The taste is not so special but it is so pricey. I don't recommend here. Even the side dish is so poor compared to other Korean restaurants."}
{"text":"Delicious and Healthy Authentic Korean Bi Bim Bap!

No Preservatives or MSG!!

All Natural and Home-Grown"}
{"text":"Place very cozy Staff very2x friendly Food we ordered for double beef bibimbap. meat was tender and very tasty lots of meat love it! also the vegetables are very tasty they will give you free miso soup,kimchi, and pickled vegetables and lastly they gave us a free cold tea made out of cinnamon and ginger which is very very good unfortunately forgot to ask our server what is it called, for me it is the best bibimbap compared to korean grill at college wherein everything is the opposite service very bad servers unfriendly definitely me and hubby will come back and taste there other stonebowl meal"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's great for people who are health conscious and have food sensitivities/food allergies. they're really great and open about gluten free, as well as MSG and Sulphite free options. the food quality is excellent. the kimchee fries are amazing, but i think the aioli contains sulphites. 

if you're good with cheap food full of chemicals you'll probably find this place pricey, but if you want real food it's the bomb."}
{"text":"I am fortunate enough to live just a short walk away from this little place.

It is an unassuming little restaurant with great food.  The owner takes a lot of pride in his food and is very friendly.  The main dishes are the various bibimbaps that come with your choice of sauce based on level of hotness/spicy-ness.  You can even ask for more sauce or different sauces and he is always happy to oblige-free of charge too!  The bibimbaps are full of various fresh veg and your choice of protein and are generously portioned.  My boyfriend and I shared a bibimbap and an appetizer and were happily full.  At the end of your meal they also offer a sweet Korean dessert drink that was quite tasty and not overly sweet.

I would definitely recommend this place to those who are in the area craving for Asian food."}
{"text":"The Bi Bim Bap here is outstanding. For its location, it is surprising to have such great authentic Korean food. The price is right, and the owners are very pleasant. Beers here are also very cheap.

The appetizers are ok. The tofu app has way too much sauce on it."}
{"text":"Very tasty and the portions are always generous.  This place is always bustling.  It was our second time and each time we've always been seated immediately.  The service, as sweet as our server and friendly the owner is, they really need to hire one more server for a busy Saturday night.  Also with an extensive affordable wine list, I don't know why serving cold red wine makes sense.  I did mention that to the server.  

I think my favourite thing about this place is the food.  Well-balanced amount of meat, rice and plenty of vegetables, and a great selection of sauces from the mild to the clearing-your-sinuses spicy.  I've opted for the mild or medium each time we've gone, and they were equally tasty."}
{"text":"The whole family loves this place. I recommend the spicy chicken."}
{"text":"Tastey and fresh and healthy ingredients. Pride of ownership by the proprietor shows."}
{"text":"I'd say average. 

Very few menu options and the Bi Bim Bap was overpriced compared to an average Korean restaurant. Also, the portions were underwhelming. 

The tiny water glasses and sauces in shot glasses were a bit strange. I hope no one ever took a shot of the super hot sauce."}
{"text":"My family is not known for their adventurous eating, but they were up for a week and I decided to take them here.  I'd been meaning to go for a while since it's so close to my residence, and saw this as the perfect opportunity.

I'll freely admit I don't know much about Korean cuisine besides from BBQ and kimchi, so I didn't know what to expect.  This place was awesome!  It focuses mostly on bibimbap, or a Korean rice dish topped with meat or veggies.  There are a number of options to try-my SO and I tried the vegetarian, and my family either got chicken or beef.  The portions aren't HUGE, but it's definitely enough to fill you up.  The kimchi fries are also pretty great; this place changed my mind on kimchi and I no longer hate it.

We'll definitely be going back and not just because it's close."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise.  Running in the $13-16 range per bowl of steamy rice served in a hot stone bowl. The focus of the  dish seems to be more on the vegetables than the meat (unless you order double beef, which the hubs said is truly a lot of beef).  Good thing the vegetables are fresh and actually tasty, and I swear someone must've taken the effort to actually prepare some of them before even putting them the serving bowl - shout out to the leeks!

You can also choose between white and brown rice, with no extra charges if you choose the brown kind.

The best part is the bibimbap sauce.  Served in a little wooden condiments tray in plastic squeeze bottles, you're provided the whole array at the beginning of the meal.  Beyond soy sauce and regular/original, there's also a salty bean paste sauce, extra hot, and apple.  Tip on the bean sauce: it's quite salty, so you might not want to douse both soy and bean paste unless you happen to be a hamster in search of a salt lick (no offense to hamsters).

In case you're wondering: yes, the restaurant is authentically Korean run and owned..."}
{"text":"We ran into this place randomly while waiting for a movie. 
As the name suggests, it only has bibimbap. The food itself is decent with small quantities. The meal is on the pricier side compared with other traditional Korean food places. Worth a shot if you need to grab a quick bite before your movie starts at The Royal. Otherwise, you can get more food at a better price elsewhere."}
{"text":"When I visited Toronto, I went this place with my friend. As an appetizer, we ordered Dukpoki Spicy Rice Cake. For the main, I ordered the Stone Bowl Bibimbap with beef and my friend ordered it with mushroom (+extra beef). We both really enjoyed those bibimbaps and rice cake very much. We have tried many kinds of Korean foods including bibimbap, and the bibimbap in this restaurant was better than other places for us. The beef and fresh vegetables in the bibimbap were really great and delicious, and it was nice to try various kinds of sauces. Also, the staff members were so friendly and attentive. We'll definitely be back next time!"}
{"text":"Not bad bi bim bap. Great, friendly service. Owner is definitely passionate about the business. Duk bo gi is a bit ketchupy, but this is the only Korean spot for miles, so it goes."}
{"text":"When it comes to Korean food, I always enjoy the simple bibimbap stoned pot rice. I was quite excited when I found out that there's such restaurant that specializes in bibimbaps. 

It was a quiet weekday when I came here with my friend. There were only a handful of tables considering how new this place is..I believe it's only been 2 weeks since grand opening? Service received was friendly and smooth. Ambience of the place is definitely casual. I saw some people walking in just enjoying their meal alone.

My friend and I both ordered the beef bibimbap ($13.99). I find it being pretty decent as they didn't give you the typical bulgogi beef. It was more like sliced beef (thicker pieces) compared to bulgogi how it's much thinner. The stoned pot was hot and toppings were fresh! I also really like the fact that they have white or brown rice option. The bibimbap came with miso soup and six different sauces that you could choose from. Mix and match the sauces if you like to sauce up your rice - I only stuck with my love for original sauce. They also served side dishes of kimchi and pickle radish. Aside from the stoned pot rice, we ordered a cool crunchy pama salad which is pretty much papaya, mango, and apple. I really enjoyed it because it was refreshing and it really helped even out the spice from the bibimbap I was having. After our meal, they served us some kind of cold cinnamon tasting soup as dessert. I'm not a big fan of cinnamon but it tasted not bad.

Overall, we had a pleasant experience and will come back again."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with decent size portions. I enjoyed their beef bibimbap with Brown rice. Very filling and tons of toppings. You can tell the cooks took special care to ensure you are getting a healthy meal. 

I also tried the chicken bites, it was a bit disappointing without the sauce it would have tasted bland.

Tip from the waiter, if you enjoy crispy rice in your bibimbap request your bowl to be extra hot. I will definitely come back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for korean stone bowl rice.  The restaurant location is out of the way for me and the pay for parking is a downside but the food is amazing!

We ordered the beef bimbimbap and the mushroom and beef stone bowl rice, along with kimchee fries.  Everything was delicious with generous portions.

I like how they bring out all the sauces for you to mix snd try.  My favourite is the Apple one, it's great if you want some sweet to go with your spicy.

Kimchee fries were nice and thin and only $5.  Beef bimbimbap cam with a lot of veggies and Mushroom beed stone bowl came with lots of mushroom variety, I enjoyed every bite!

Wish they would open a location in Markham so I can have this more often."}
{"text":"I loved having dinner here! The mushroom Bi Bim Bap was amazing, tons of interesting mushrooms, fresh ingredients, tasted amazing. Perfect portions so you're full but not overstuffed. They happen to care about non-GMO, no MSG, gluten-free and vegan options -which is rare. Very friendly people, and you can tell they run this place with passion and care. Impressed. We'll definitely go back, and tell our friends."}
{"text":"Really pricy, and parking spot is kind hard to find. Food is fare, a bit over price ."}
{"text":"You can probably find a slightly less expensive bibimbap in Korea town that comes with more small Korean side dishes, but this is definitely a great place for a hot stone delight.
I've come here a few times and always been satisfied.
Today I ordered the crispy tofu bibimbap with an additional egg added on top. The egg was an extra cost, which is a downer, but it really adds richness to the meal. The complimentary kimchi and picked veg were good on the side as well.
Certainly a filling meal with nice flavours!
The end of meal cinnamon beverage (cold tea?) is a nice touch I haven't encountered in other Korean restaurants. It is a sweet afterthought to the main dish."}
{"text":"I am no expert on Korean cuisine but Bi Bim Bap is yummy. I have yet to eat in but have had both take out and delivery and the food is great, the place is spotless, delivery is fast (under 20 minutes) and the staff is soooooo friendly.  My usual order is:
Jap Chae
Warm Sweet Potato Glass Noodle Salad. $4.99
Duk Po Ki (very spicy but if you don't like spicy you can order a sweet soy glaze)
Rice Cakes made from steamed rice cooked in a spicy sauce. Very common street food found in most Korean cities. $4.99
and
STONE BOWL RICE: $12.99 (the following dishes do not have the BiBimBap veggies)
Start with a choice of White or Brown Rice. with double chicken and Extra Hot GoChuJang

mmm mmm mmm"}
{"text":"Since we don't have a bibimbap place where we live, we wanted to check out this place while we were in Toronto. First of all, it was DELICIOUS! We were surprised how vegan friendly a Korean restaurant could be. I thought of my vegan friends.

Appetizer: we decided to try a couple of appetizers that were vegan friendly. Kimchi fries was a great start - its Korean mayo was made from tofu, interesting. We really liked it. We also had sweet spicy tempeh & rice cake, which was amazing. It was different from Ttokbokki, reminded me of Korean street food, rice cake skewer but in a better version. It had a well balanced sweet and spicy flavor.

Main: we had steak bibimbap and double spicy chicken stone bowl rice. We were very happy that we tried this place! It was the best bibimbap we've had in years. It was exciting to see plenty of chunks of juicy steak coming in a sizzling hot stone bowl. We also enjoyed double spicy chicken stone bowl rice very much. One brilliant and fun thing about this place was there were six different bibimbap sauces you could choose. 

Price: we thought it was pretty reasonable considering the serving sizes. 

Services: everyone was so friendly. The staff was very attentive. 

The whole experience was very pleasant. We will definitely come back here when we are in town again. If you are looking for fun, healthy, delicious and flavorful food, this place is a must-try!"}
{"text":"Being a fan of the Bop, I was delighted to hear this place opened. 
I frequent the places on Koreatown and this posh neighborhood could sure use a place like this among all the upscale, mediocre bakeries.
Unfortunately, I was expecting Seoul and getting Pyonyang

The place doesn't bring Koreatown to Eglington - no, no, no. 
The other way round. It Foresthills this traditional, inexpensive dish. 
Not on the price, but on everything else.

We shared several dishes. All and all the bop was OK, nothing special.
It's the little things - for example, why so skimchy ?
In that orange place on Bloor / Clinton you get 5 yes count em 5 starters, including 2 kinds of great and hot kimchy.

Here we got one small dish (for 3 people !) and it was more pickled cabbage than kimchy.
The BBQ Bibimbap dish didn't have a lot of meat. The mushroom kind was pretty good. 

But all the dishes feel too small. And you don't get to fish rice out the water ! Hopefully things will improve there. Until then, Bi Bim Bye !"}
{"text":"Hopped into this place with my gf taking me out with my broken ankle. It was pretty empty in there in the mid afternoon, but picked up closer to 5. It was very clean and modern inside, which is different than the decor I'm used to in the Korean neighborhood I work in. We decided to go all out and got a bottle of wine, which was pretty decent. We also got some beef dumplings, which was good but nothing to take my breath away. We both got the beef bowls, which were served in very nice stone black dishes. It also came with 6 sauces on the side to try, plus kimchi. Oh and also a miso soup. The beef bowl, even with the sauces didn't have the authentic taste I'm used to. I had to keep adding sauces and kimchi to give it some oompf, but I still wasn't impressed. Also, other Korean places I have gone to give a ton of different vegetables and dishes to compliment your meal. You also had to pay to add the egg on top, while other places include this. For the price point, and lack of wow factor I won't return. 2.5 stars"}
{"text":"Great local spot for Korean Bi Bim Bap (hot stone bowl rice). Awesome in the winter because it warms you up. The tofu Bi Bim Bap is good. Try the Kimchi Fries, they have a hint of sweetness which balances out the spiciness. The meal finishes off with a cold cinnamon tea, which is always my favorite way to cleanse off my pallet after a spicy meal."}
{"text":"I used to live in New York City and would frequent K-Town for the amazing food on offer. Since moving away, I've always wondered if anywhere else could serve the caliber of Korean food I had grown used to. Thankfully, Bi Bim Bap was recommended to me and its incredible food has proven to me that an absolute treasure of a Korean restaurant gleams bright in Toronto.

To start, I had the Kimchi Fries and Korean Tacos. I'm usually a bit skeptical about fusion fare, since it tends to be heavy in concept and light in performance, but both of these items stole the day. The Fries were a delight and sustained the full taste of the Kimchi and the Fries in a well-balanced experience. I don't know what's in the Mayo, but wow, I want a giant container of it to smother on my lunch sandwiches everyday.

Likewise, the Tacos were delicious; tender beef, covered in rich Korean BBQ flavor housed in a delicately crunchy shell..... only having 6 felt like torture! When I saw the other appetizers served on neighboring tables, I regretted having ordered only two items. Next time!

Now, to the really fun part. I ordered Stone Bowl Spicy Chicken Bibimbap. Wow! I had had bibimbap several times before and had enjoyed it, but this time was different. To begin with, the ingredients are so fresh that the flavors of the cabbage, onions, rice and chicken make a searing impression on your tongue. You can tell the ownership is at the market everyday, looking for the best produce available. I salute that!

The chicken was tender and juicy and carried the kind of spice I desired. Not too much, not too little, just enough to feel it, but still catch all the other flavors in the mouth. For those who aren't big into spice, then a non-spiced version of this dish is available as well.

I feel like I was smiling the whole time I was eating here and so maybe looked a bit silly. But it was a fantastic experience and I would recommend it to everyone.

Oh yea, did I mention that the service was wonderful? Other perks are a huge choice of sauces, a vegan friendly menu, which I think is pioneering for Korean cuisine.

All in all a fantastic restaurant! Definitely check it out. I know I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My partner and I were looking for a place to eat and this place was one of the first and top rated options on yelp. So curiously we checked it out. 

This place has its charm. The orange wall aside the place is nice and cozy as well as has they sort of modern take on a small restaurant. The menu isn't extensive but it has the food that the restaurant advertises. 

We started off with the Korean tacos and got barley tea and one other Korean tea to start. For the main we split the mushroom bi bum bap and added beef. The taste had that great earthiness that mushrooms have and the mix of vegetables plus the added beef rounded out the rest of the meal. The most pleasant surprise was the assortment of gochujangs that accompanied. I did a mix of the bean, sour, and soy. I just enjoy the options to be able to customize your spice mix. 

Service was attentive and the price was reasonable.   I could not find a reason to fault the restaurant. If Bi Bim Bap is not your thing than maybe you won't rate this restaurant a 5 but the food was good and the ability to customize your own taste made the experience."}
{"text":"This place is serious about their Bibimbap like seriously hands down best bibimbap ever.

 Their take on kimchi fries took me by surprise withhow small their fries are, so crunchy! I loved it as a mini appetizer. The tacos were okay and so was the ddeokbokki.

 I ordered the Muhroom bibimbap on brow rice and holy mushrooms were there so many different types of mushrooms including portebello and maitake which are one off my favourite mushrooms. Killer dish. My friends ordered the spicy chicken on white rice and double beef on brown rice. The selction of sauces was literally the cherry on top. I used the extra spicy sauce ajd apple sauce together and omg the flavour. 

The waiters are nice an they will refill your kimchi and radish pickles (which re amazing because they use the greener radishes so you can taste the unripe flavour and aaah my tastebuds are so happy). Will be coming back again."}
{"text":"My wife and I were being guided through the city tonight by google as it was helping us avoid the highway traffic on our way home. As we turned on to Eglinton, I saw this place and suggested we try it instead of going home to cook. After pulling over, I quickly checked Yelp (Surprised?) and the reviews were pretty good!

As we got inside, we noticed that they were proudly displaying a BlogTO \"Best Korean Restaurant\" award for 2011. 

When I write reviews, my absolute primary interest is the quality of food. Bad service rarely makes an impact because as long as the food is good, I'm willing to endure anything. The service was OK... But we were only the third table for two in the place and we didn't even get our order taken for over 20 minutes. I can only guess that this was an off day. Luckily the food came about 10-15 minutes later but for a place that was mostly empty, this was a surprise.

And here is where Bi Bim Bap lost me. Korean food has become my favourite food from the Asian part of the world. I've been eating Korean regularly for over 20 years now. 

I can only say that their 2011 award was either \"Best Korean Restaurant in an area without any competition, yay, you win...\" OR, \"Best Korean Restaurant\" as voted for by people trying Korean for the first time.

The food wasn't BAD, but it was absolutely not good either. It was perfectly down the middle ordinary and relatively bland as Korean food comes. Perhaps I should have known better of a Korean food in this super white neighborhood. I gave a bad review for another place across the street and as we walked out, I declared to my wife that we can never live in this part of the city because there don't seem to be any good places to eat in the area. No matter that the houses and neighborhood seem really nice.

In the Banchan department, all we got was a microscopic serving of tiny chopped up Kimchi and a few radish slices. Check out my pics.

Not that this should impact my review but I was super surprised to find that they offered an XXX hot sauce that came with a warning for how amazingly hot it was. I tried it just to see and it wasn't even as hot as a normal mild Gochujang sauce that you can buy from any Korean grocery...

So do yourself a favour and drive to one of our two major Korean areas and go just about anywhere else.

As I double check my review, I see that it comes off a bit vitriolic. I don't want to rewrite it because I think it's kind of funny and it is honest but really, this place is a solid 2.5. Not better, not worse."}
{"text":"Got beef and mushroom stone bowl takeout from here, it was great! The sauces made it extra delish"}
{"text":"Bi Bam Bap, as the name suggests, serves up a variety of stone bowls. I ordered the tofu stone bowl with veggies, my partner ordered the veggie curry bowl and we shared vegan kimchi fries. (Always a bonus to dine alike, more sharing, more caring.)

The kimchi fries are YUM and I am excited to go back and eat an entire serving for myself (live your best life, right!). The dish has julienned fries served with a flavoured mayo and kimchi. It could have done with more of the fixings for the little fries underneath that hadn't been blessed with toppings.

My tofu stone bowl was... well, it's mixed veggies with crispy cubes of tofu and rice, so I knew what I was in for, but I give credit to how abundant and fresh the veggies looked! I nipped curry sauce from my partner's dish to add more flavour to my stone bowl and ended up hoarding the brussels sprouts too! (Hello, Bi Bim Bap, please make a side order with just these brussels sprouts! I will be indebted to you!) 

And finally, honourable mention to the caddy of sauces in squeeze bottles they provide because fun!"}
{"text":"Before this evening we had never eaten at a Korean restaurant.  We were  so impressed with Bibimbap, 598 College Street, Toronto. 
Excellent food, service and  very reasonably priced. You must go there!!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite foods in the world is bibimbap. Since being vegan, I couldn't find a vegan one for a while. Apparently, the restaurant I used to go to for bibimbap wouldn't substitute tofu, so that was a sad time in my life.

Yesterday, I was out with friends and we were looking for a vegan friendly place for me in the North York area. I came across this on Yelp, saw vegan bibimbap, and automatically wanted to go.

The tofu bibimbap is so, so good. Tofu is crisp and the original gochujang is great. Also, vegan kimchi fries? Whaat? Not gonna lie, the spiciness of the sesame mayo threw me off, but it was really great. I only ate half of both dishes and brought the rest home. Both dishes reheat really well.

I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I am excited that Bi Bim Bap has opened a second location on College Street, with the original location being at Bathurst and Eglinton, which has been in operation for several years.  The College location is a little bit bigger.  We were able to walk in and get a table right away.  I trust that it will get busier (I believe they opened only a few weeks ago).

I tried to Korean chicken bites to start with the hot and sweet sauce as a side.  The sauce was too hot for my liking so I used the garlic soy that they use for the bi bim bap instead.  For my main, I got my go-to of the tofu stone bowl with brown rice and an assortment of vegetables topped with the garlic soy sauce.  It comes with a miso soup and a cold tea that tastes like apple cinnamon.  They bring a selection of sauces to the table so you can test them out if you have tolerance for spice (unlike me!).

It was extra cold last night so warming up to Buckwheet tea and a bi bim bap was the perfect combination."}
{"text":"Fantastic gluten-free bi bim bap. Always nice to have a place that can accommodate allergies."}
{"text":"Okay, this place has a SMALL menu and specializes in bi bim bap.  Surprise!!!

It's a modernized Korean restaurant and i tend to favour restaurants with small menus because they only serve what they are good at.

Ordered the beef bi bim bap and was fresh and loved the fact that you ha a variety of sauce choices.  My gf ordered the kalbi, and looked absolutely delicious.

The downside is that this place is expensive, spent 40 bucks for dishes that would cost 30 at most. I say it's worth it but not an every week visit, more like a treat.

Would go back."}
{"text":"Food is great. Whoever says it is expensive,  try paying rent or mortgage for a Forest Hill property. There is a reason why everything in Forest Hill is more expensive than on Bloor. 


We love the food. They have brown rice option, and mushroom medley dish good for vegans. And it is tasty. 
 
That's why we are back periodically. Even after once they made us wait so long that I was not sure, should I cry from hunger or start biting chairs in the hope that someone notices me. 

Time healed my wounds, and I was back to Bi Bim Bap. Tasty. Close to home. Small and family run. And I missed that mushroom medley thing with spicy sauce."}
{"text":"Hankering for vegetarian Korean food, we finally struck gold. \"BI BIM BAP\"!! 
We had mushroom & vegetable bi bim bap! Simply superb!! Their kids menu has an appetizing menu - not boring plain pasta...
The miso soup & kin chee served with the food make for yummy sides.
Their after dinner ginger-cinnamon drunk with pine nuts just hits the spot.
They also have a great selection of Korean alcohol.
The service is polite & very amicable.
They also have a buzzer on the table to summon the wait staff which makes for efficient service.
Definitely worth repeat visit."}
{"text":"This place would be more like a 3.5 star rating. The food was decent and the prices are too, considering it's within the forest hill district. I like their choices of the bim bi bap - whether you want a chicken, beef, tofu or mushroom type, it's there! But their bim bi bap portions are a bit small.
They do make up for it with the tasty, fresh ingredients that are served in it. I loved how their appetizers were only for $5! We got the chicken bites, kimchi fries and rice cakes.The chicken bites were pretty bland, nothing special. The kimchi fries were good - I liked how thin they were. The rice cakes were tasty as well. Our order of the double beef stone bowl was good, but it was a small portion. Service was amazing though and they give so many sauces for your bimbibap - it's fun to play around with the tastes. Probably will be back to try their other bimbibap."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem with a friend as we were walking on Collage St. looking for a new place to try out. This is probably one of the best valued food joints in the city. The food is prepared really well with good quality ingredients, which you will notice when you eat. The sauces are made in house and everything on the menu is MSG free, which you can't say for majority of similar restaurants! The service was also amazing-very attentive. I would definitely recommend this place! You will eat WELL and not break the bank!! Thank me later! :)"}
{"text":"Great restaurant for anyone who would like to try the amazing and classic Korean dish: Bi Bim Bap. I've been coming here for the past two years and it has never failed to deliver to my table a hearty, tasteful stonebowl of Bi Bim Bap!"}
{"text":"A really yummy meal. Got the double chicken on rice. Really nice cuts of meat, lots of flavor and a yummy selection of spicy or mild sauces. The apple spice is amazing and garlic soy is yummy. Also the owner is a lovely person. I'll be back a lot!"}
{"text":"A modest little Korean place in the heart of Forest Hill.  First impressions: pleasant service, a  variety of appetizers, decent prices, not too crowded, great neighbourhood spot.

My friend and I ordered (of course!) the BiBimBap. Very filling!  As the menu describes, this is a large stone bowl offering of white or brown rice, korean radish, spinach, bean sprouts, carrots, cucumber, burdock, sweet potato stem, zucchini, shiitake mushroom, dried seaweed, and sesame seeds, along with your choice of topping.  I chose the Kalbi:  flame broiled short ribs, with sweet marinade on the veggies, on top of brown rice. To spice it up, I picked Sour Hot GoChuJang (mild hot homemade sauce).  My friend ordered the Korean BBQ Spicy Chicken BiBimBap with white rice and the Original Hot GoChuJang sauce.

Before our main dish arrived, we enjoyed an appetizer of sliced deep fried chicken breast, a touch spicy (Ko Ko Chicken), with coleslaw.  We were also served tea and green onion soup.

My short ribs were delicious - although I think the brown rice was a bit too nutty-textured and tasteless for me.  I should have gotten the white, but ah well, I was trying to be good. :)  My lunch companion enjoyed her bowl.  The meal was satisfying, although not mind blowing.  Our meal ended with a traditional Korean dessert punch, made of cinnamon, ginger, and persimmon.  Light & sweet.  An adequate and pleasant Korean lunch!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night at around 6pm with a friend.  We were mildly confused at how the restaurant was super empty at the time (we were only the customers for a good 20 minutes until another party of four came in).  The waiter was very patient with us since it was our first time and he explained the popular items on the menu for us.

I got the Beef and Mushroom Stone Bowl, and my friend got the same but with an egg on top (extra $1.50), and we split the Cool Crunchy Pama Salad.

We were given miso soup and only 2 banchan appetizers to start.  The stone bowl portion sizes were smaller than I expected, but there were a lot of types of mushroom in the bowl.  The pama salad was a bit interesting in taste (kind of like a mix of caesar salad dressing with some ranch and some sesame sauce??), but had adequate amounts of papaya and apple.  We were intrigued by the various sauces they gave us to put on the bibimbap.  We squeezed out small amounts of each to taste, but I only really ended up putting some of the original sauce onto my bibimbap.  After finishing the mains, we were given very small bowl that was a cold cinnamon drink which had a pine nut in it.  Apparently it is made in-house -- very cinammon-y.

Overall, the taste of each of the dishes was fine, just a bit more on a pricy side (in comparison to some other Korean places uptown).  Good for a first try here."}
{"text":"Came here around 4pm on a weekday. It was just us inside the restaurant. I was very excited to try out the place since I love bibimbap and I can only have brown rice. The restaurant looks nice and clean. Service was great. In my opinion, the food tasted ok (6.5/10) but I love how they have so many sauces options.  
Not sure if I'll come back. I think it's expensive for a small bowl of bibimbap with an average taste."}
{"text":"I got the Beef and mushroom stone bowl.  Portion size was smaller than I would like.  Taste was ok and they had many different sauces to add to your meal to adjust the flavors and spiciness in the bowl.  If you are a mushroom lover there were lots of variety of mushrooms to munch on.  The korean side banchan dishes were small and only 3 options.  They did give us free bowl of miso soup after we ordered our meal.  May try another dish here again if I was in the area.
Date: Tuesday 9pm
Crowd: 90% empty
Service: friendly and attentive
Decor: Modern, not fine dining
Price: Higher than most places
Food type: Fusion Korean"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT. We went in on a whim for a late lunch on a Sunday (around 3 pm?) and the place was empty nearly empty (it was a curiously slow day for foot traffic - the weather also wasn't great) but this is a total gem. The restaurant itself is cozy with orange walls that add a nice warmth. Our waitress was amazing! When we told her it was our first time she took a long time to explain the sauces and variations on the bowls which we really appreciated. 

Our table had to Korean tacos to share as well as the appetizer of the day (both $5 each) which was a fried chicken with a lemon aioli and jicama slaw. The tacos are one bite, but you get 6 per order which was perfect for us. The fried chicken bites were crispy and hot, and the slaw and aioli were super good, creamy and crisp and cut through the grease of the fried batter well. 

For our mains, I had the beef stone bowl bi bim bap with an added egg, and my lunch mates had the spicy chicken and mushroom bowls respectively (sans egg) The bowls are piping hot when they come out, and loaded with vegetables and meat. The table also comes with a series of sauces ranked in order of spice, ranging from mild bean to very spicy chilli. Our personal favourite hot sauce was the apple one - it added a little touch of sweetness to soothe the heat, an added a lovely flavour. The bowls might seem like they won't fill you up, but they really, really do - the rice and veggies cook as you stir so everything is crispy and hot as you eat. If you're in the area and craving good korean, this is the palce!"}
{"text":"3.5****
I have been here for lunch a few times now. The food is quality and the restaurant itself is nice and clean. I personally don't find it has enough ambiance or selection for dinner but it's probably good anyways.

The prices are expensive if you your looking to be full. The bibimbap is good but I found it a little bland, even after some extra sauce. There is only a scant shaving of beef in the standard hotpot with a fried egg, some veggies and rice. Having the choice of sauce and brown rice is nice but like I said it doesn't offer any lunch specials at all. 

We ordered the kimchi taco starter which was good but didn't knock me out of the park....especially since I don't eat kimchi. Lol. The tea is good here and their you ask for water they pour it from a fancy chilled pitcher with fancy ice. At the end of the meal you get a refreshing bowl of cinnamon/pumpkin drink. 

The service is brutally slow and it's almost impossible to get the attention of the waitresses..,especially one in particular. There was only 2 other people in the entire restaurant, like, hello?"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Love how health conscious these guys are and their commitment to free ingredients and no chemicals etc.... Brown rice options, tasty quick, great service....we'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Bi bim bap is my favorite Korean dish, to the extent that I rate a Korean restaurant based on the quality of its bi bim bap.  And hey, if a Korean restaurant can't get this classic Korean comfort food right, something is seriously wrong with the restaurant.  

I ordered a Beef Bi Bim Bap on brown rice.  I confess that it was my mistake that I chose brown rice out of curiosity.  Big mistake.  Other than the brown rice, the beef (not enough), the veggie (fresh), the chili sauce (a choice of 6 sauces and of 3 spiciness levels), and the hot stone bowl (pipping hot) were okay.  I would likely enjoy the dish better had it been on white rice."}
{"text":"I love coming to this restaurant on Eglinton. The STONE BOWL SPICY CHICKEN AND REGULAR CHICKEN WAS UNREAL! It came out so quickly and its really well priced!
Make sure you come here and visit. The staff is great and super friendly!"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick and tasty dinner. The menu is relatively simple, but everything is delicious. Service is friendly, ambiance is casual. 
If you are not super hungry, get an appetizer and order one of the stone bowls with double the meat/chicken and share with a friend. 
They do takeout, but when you eat in the food stays hot in the stone bowls, and you get a yummy cold drink when you sit down and a free taster.
4/5 stars because I wish there was more to the menu."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened in 2011! The food is staple Korean food, but elevated with no MSG and shellfish-free kimchi. 

FOOD: on this visit, my friend and I ordered beef bibimbap and added fried egg for a minimal cost. The veggies looked and tasted fresh, beef was tender - had a nice balance taste to it. As for the sauce, you have 6 to choose from, anywhere from mild soy garlic & sesame bean to sour/apple/original/extra spicy gochujang (pepper paste). Personally I like a mix of sesame bean & original, then halfway through the bowl I'll add a squeeze or 2 of extra spicy. 

SERVICE: our server was helpful, engaged us in pleasantries, took our order and allowed my friend and I privacy. After delivering the food, he came a few times to check on us, asked if we needed more kimchi and pickles.

TIP: 
1. they offer vegan & gluten free options
2. I've tried kimchi fries, dukpoki & tacos from their appe menu & beef, spicy chicken, mushrooms & tofu from their bibimbap menu - ALL yummy"}
{"text":"Sorry to say, I went to find out what the hype was about: a dolsot bibimbap joint in midtown near a subway, in future to be served by an LRT, provided it lasts that long, why not give it a go.

Two of us went and both ordered stone bowl bi bim bap. Offered a long and definitely non-traditional list of accompanying sauces, I asked our server to limit the choices to one (standard gochujang) to be told we'd be getting all of them. Way to fill half a tiny table. I'd rather be served more than two banchan- given I'm not the biggest fan of pickled radish or kimchi, nothing for me here.
And what place does miso soup have in a Korean restaurant?
My favourite part of a dolsot bibimbap is the crispy rice against the bowl. I'm not sure whether it was because I ordered brown rice rather than white or if it had to do with the sensitivity-friendly kitchen refusing to use sesame oil- either way I was let down.
It seemed as though the banchan were already mixed into the bibimbap, please let me choose what goes in! I sat there picking pickles out of my bowl. Put them into a bowl and let people decide whether to add them on their own, that's what banchan are about. Otherwise, the bibimbap was fairly tasteless despite having the usual compliment of toppings.
Extra charge for egg? Why not include it and say it can be removed for your delicate sensitivity-minded Forest Hill types?"}
{"text":"It's hard to not give this place 5 stars.  Unique menu, great service and fantastic food.

Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today for lunch. Modern clean atmosphere, nothing special but nothing bad either. The kimchi fries were so yummy. Thin (thin thin!!) fries with kimchi and some sauce on it. Delicious. I tried the seed bowl and my friend had the beef mushroom. The quality was good and we both enjoyed our dishes. The cinnamon sugar tea served at the end of the meal is such a nice touch. The other big plus was the great service. There are quite a few clearly labeled vegan and gluten free options as well. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I tried Bi Bim Bap's new Little Italy location with a friend on a Sunday. The place was relatively empty which we attributed to them being open in this location for only two weeks. The menu offers a selection of various hot stone bowl Bi Bim Bap options with white or brown rice. I had the standard beef offering which was amazing. My friend's spicy chicken was great according to him. They have several homemade pepper sauces (gojugiang) including an extra hot one made with ghost peppers. It had a nice heat with a good flavor profile and complimented the bibimbab nicely. Each entree includes a small miso soup and cold Korean dessert tea (cinnamon and persimmon with brown sugar). 

Overall, an excellent take on the Korean staple dish."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and even better service. My boyfriend and I were seated right away and ordered the Korean Tacos to start, followed by the mushroom and spicy chicken Bibimbap. Their collection of mild to hot sauces was explained to us and they were SO delicious. We were surprised with miso soup before our Bibimbap, and a delicious drink that is meant to cool down your mouth at the end of your meal. Loved everything about this place! Would highly recommend. Can't wait to go back to try more."}
{"text":"I really liked this place, the only minus is the price. Same amount of food in North York would have rang in a bill of about $25 instead of $40, can't imagine rent being that much more expensive in Upper Village.

Pluses: nice decor and wonderful service, for those not familiar with Korean service - if you need anything (more water, place an order, get the bill etc) USE THE BUTTON on the table, you server will be with you in an instant like a genie from the bottle.
Food was quite good, absolutely loved the PAMA salad, its Keifer (Yogurt) Honey Ginger Ginsing dressing is my new fave. Veggie tempura was A-OK, though shreds are sometimes hard to separate. Rice cakes were wonderfully spicy, chewy, perfectly sized and just what they should be. Jap Chae was cooked with cabbage, interesting twist, but not to my liking, although to be fair the noodles themselves were perfect, slurpy, warm and not too sweet nor salty. I am confident the rest of the appetizers are just as good as neighbouring tables seemed to consume theirs with lightning speed.

Bi Bim Bap itself is your usual Bap, brown rice option is appreciated by health conscious me as well as the fact that you can pick your own sauce and have it served on the side, so it is for you to decide how much sauce you want. However at $12 a portion and no banchan included it is quite a hike from my usual $8/bowl, so I am probably not going to become a regular here, although will certainly return.

All in all, delicious food, beautiful presentation your date will certainly appreciate  (smth you rarely see in Korean establishments, no offence, they are just usually on a homey side), great service, and did I say delicious food? To me it's all that matters."}
{"text":"I try and go here at least every other week.
the food is great, (fresh, tasty and healthy)

The atmosphere is fine, it can get loud and service can be a little slow...but when that happens the owner usually takes a little off the bill and apologizes!

Great place."}
{"text":"The food here is great. Prices are a bit steep and the banchan (side dishes) were lacking (they did have a nice little miso soup though), but it's exactly what I would expect in this neighbourhood, and it makes sense. When I was there it looked as though no one else in there had tried or even know what bibimbap was.The dish has been slightly modernized to accommodate the North American palate, with several options to mix it up a bit (mushroom, tofu, etc. as well as the choice of brown rice), but they also have the traditional unheated bi bim bap and dolsot (hot) bibimbap.

Having lived in Korea, I truly think that was one of the better bi bim bap's I've eaten.

No matter what you get, I highly recommend getting it with the egg. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I often came here when I worked in the area and I LOVE it. I don't like traditional bibimbap, but this is different because you can choose what meat you want for your bibimbap (or mushrooms if you're a vegetarian). 

Every meal starts with some kimchi, pickled daikon, and miso soup. I usually get the kimchi fries to share and thebeef bibimbap which tastes similar to bulgogi. You also get a selection of 6 different sauces, from mild to extra hot. The meal ends with a cold cinnamon drink with a single pine nut. Yumm,"}
{"text":"Went back to BBB with a friend on Sunday afternoon... After raving about the food and service and what not.


No one was in the front to greet us for the first ten minutes...

The food was good but not as tasty as days before...

My Half rice portion was minuscule and the \"extra\" meat was nowhere near as much as the Thursday before.

I hate inconsistency. So I have to update the rating and 

I RECOMMEND- going during the week

Extra tip- Their ribs (appetizer) are fast and tasty but not a share portion"}
{"text":"Service was a bit of a let down since they were understaffed - 1 serving around 30 people. They had an extensive bibimbap menu and an app menu featuring some deliciously-sounding side dishes. We ordered the beef bimbimbap and it was a long wait to get it to our table. The bimbimbap was delicious with the hot gochujang sauce. However, the side kimchi was a bummer as it was too salty and lack the regular kimchi flavour."}
{"text":"Pretty average Bibimbap with above average prices. I got the beef bibimbap with the sour hot gochujang. The sour hot gochujang was a too sour for my tastes but I guess I should've expected that. The portion was decent. They do give you a few complimentary side dishes but I didn't like either of them. The miso soup was alright. They do give you plenty of veggies in the bibimbap and a good amount of beef too. And you get the option of brown rice or white rice as well which is pretty unique. The not-so-tasty gochujang and the very dry beef sort of hurt the dish though. Maybe I'll try their original gochujang next time."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time, based on some good reviews online. I had dinner here on a Saturday with a party of 8 people.

ATMOSPHERE: Casual and trendy place. It got pretty busy at dinner time. At times there was a line out the door. They have space for small and large parties in their spacious dining room.

SERVICE: Fast service, attentive staff. Like most traditional Korean restaurants, they have a buzzer at each table - so you can call directly for service at any time.

PRICE: Average. Basic bi bim bap is comparable to other Korean joints. But their special bi bim baps, as expected, cost more.

FOOD: Rice cakes - small portion. But our server warned us of this, so we added Kim Chi Fries to our appetizer order. Kim Chi fries were really good! Fries were thin and crispy. Good portion. I enjoyed the fries more than the rice cakes (they were okay but not exceptional).

For my entrée I tried a special Stone Bowl Bi Bim Bap: Mushroom & beef. It was really tasty. It had a variety of mushrooms and were all flavourful. The portion was generous - very filling - I couldn't finish my bowl.

It's nice to know that they have options for different rice, and substitutions too. They also have gluten-free and other sensitive options for all types of eaters!

Would return to try some of those other options."}
