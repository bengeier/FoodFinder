{"text":"Thank goodness for Big Slice!  This extremely reasonably price dine-in/take out/delivery joint just hits the spot! It is very family friendly (You can sit an infant car seat in the window sill and get a high chair for a toddler!) and is so casual you could dine in your pajamas.  PERFECT The food is great! Comfort Italian with no frills. Great for when \"making dinner\" is just not an option! i have had Big Slice delivered, done the take-out route, and dined in, all with the same positive conclusion. Good food at a good price."}
{"text":"This has very quickly been a favourite spot for me and my two kids. Sure, it helps that it's literally across the street from my place, but the food is reasonable, the atmosphere is *very* kid friendly (we've yet to go when there weren't a couple other families there).   The food isn't amazing, but it's good and hits the spot and is definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting, they employ the worst people to represent them. I've been here for lunch a few times but after a sexist comment made about/to me by the manager(he claimed to be later on the phone) of the restaurant I am NEVER spending another dime in that place. What's more after I called to speak to a manager regarding the comment, a woman answered and told me she was the manager, after expressing concern and telling her what the sexist employee said to me as I drove by him (back ally) she proceeded to go on the defence and blame the issue on me. Then she asked if I wanted to talk to the guy who said what he said, so I responded with \"I want to speak with a manager who can help resolve this issue\". To my surprise the sexist empkoyee comes on the line apologizing for what he said to me \"bc he knows how society is and that's why he shouldn't have said what he said\". Excuse you?! So your apologizing bc society is \"too sensitive\". When I questioned him on the fact that a business owner speaks to women in that manner and how he could be so disgusting he replied with asking what I did for a living- as if it were relevant! He agreed he was in the wrong, with the actions and words he chose, apologized again and followed that with a \"but\" and justification. I thanked him and ended the call as clearly that conversation was going nowhere. So I'm now left to wonder how a manager/owner of such an establishment feels he has the right to treat women so vulgar and when confronted and questioned about it be so sarcastic and not know what an apology is suppose be like. I urge you, if you believe that women and men should be treated fairly and not categorized into a bucket filled with \"women\", STAY FAR AWAY from this place bc clearly the management/owners don't believe we are all equal!"}
{"text":"I ate in and thought the food was fine and a good deal. I stopped in for take out a few weeks ago, around 8:00 p.m. on a Saturday night. I waited over 50 minutes for two orders of veg lasagna.  I have no clue what the incredible delay was about. I sat patiently, within the sightline of the counter staff(they bring over your take out order). Despite this ridiculous wait time, the staff was not apologetic or offer an explanation why it was taking do long. They did not even offer a complementary soft drink during this long wait. The restaurant was not busy. I have no clue what the issue was, but this was an incredible amount of time to wait. The atmosphere is kind of unpleasant, with the inescapable sports on big t.v.'s everywhere."}
{"text":"Worse customer service ever! I would never order from them again. In my whole life was never treated so poorly over the phone ."}
{"text":"The pizza is yummy and it's a fair price,veal sandwich is tasty and soft,not a long wait at lunch time ,friendly staff."}
{"text":"Recently had an unfortunate experience there with my wife and 3 kids. Dirty tables. Dirty glasses. Dirty bathrooms. And rude owner to top it off. it's really unfortunate because this place has been around for a while. but, clearly it's best days are way behind it.  A few dishes are mediocre at best, and the rest are pretty below average.  Veal and chicken sandwiches: they are not fresh. the cutlets are all dry from waiting in the front. and the sandwich bread was stale. and as other reviewers have mentioned, very bland sauce to top it off. most veal sandwich places will fry on order. Not this place.  pasta: very bland, stale tomato sauce.  Chicken wings: dry, dry, dry.  Price: Overpriced for what you are getting. 2 adults, 3 kids. no desert. $70+tip.  Service: Slow and indifferent. Waitress got our order wrong (we'd asked for sauce on the side). And then she denied it and did nothing to rectify.  Owner: I have a dietary restriction. So I explained it and asked the owner for a simple request. He kept on calling it strange, odd and ultimately refused to accommodate.  At the  prices they are charging, you can do MUCH better in that neighborhood. Marcello's across to street to begin with. Do yourself a favour and try another spot."}
{"text":"I get the wings at least once a week, sometimes is better than others. I love the delivery guy!"}
{"text":"Very generous portions!  I sometimes get the \"Big Plate\" which allows you to choose 4 items from there great selection of choices.  The food is not amazing but good enough for a semi-fast food restaurant.  I normally get their veal sandwich which is always good, but sometimes I feel the bun that it's on is a little too big, but to some people that's a great thing.  This is my go to place for veal sandwiches!"}
{"text":"While the portions are huge the environment and food sometimes make me think of the mcdonalds of Italian food. It's great for something quick or you feel like sharing a pizza with a friend. If you're hungry and on a budget you will find hearty and yummy food. However, it's not a date place at all unless you stay on the patio and never use the washroom. A plus is that they stay open really late and it reminds me of when we would grab food to eat after a night of dancing at the clubs. The food is Italian but lacks the home feeling of Italian food that you can find elsewhere on st Clair. I sometimes call it the chef boyardee of Italian but it's quick and cheap"}
{"text":"First and last time I will go here. I paid over $9 for a small vegetarian pizza when I could have paid $6 for two slices (which would have been bigger than the pizza I got and it would have coat me less).   When I brought this to the cashier's attention she just said \"sorry\". I said it would have been good customer service to make me aware that it works out cheaper to buy two slices and she said \"Well, you looked like you knew what you wanted\".  In my opinion, that is terrible customer service, to knowingly charge more for a smaller portion and play dumb when I brought it to her attention. Obviously making a sly profit is more important to them than offering their customers value.  Avoid!"}
{"text":"First time ordering here and was not disappointed.  Ordered he #1 special - medium pizza, wings and 2 Coles for a very fair price $20  Was told they where super busy so it would take about an hour which was fine and I appreciated the heads up from the guy who took the call  The pizza and wings were fantastic and it was more then enough food for the two of us  Will be ordering again no doubt!"}
{"text":"Big Slice! Reasonable prices for the pizza that you can get.  Good pizza that is on par with what you would expect for the money"}
{"text":"I used to go to this place a lot, but won't be any longer. The older gentleman who works the take-out counter is notorious for charging extra. I've been charged an extra 10 cents on pizza slices multiple times, and just the other day I had 3 meal orders and was charged a dollar extra per order. I don't always check the price, like most people I assume the cashier is doing the right thing and I just tap my card and go. So who knows how long this has been going on! Luckily I started calculating the price before going and making him recalculate my order. But it's ridiculous. And he absolutely knows what he's doing. If he over charges for each customer, imagine the amount he's probably making in a day! I've been a loyal customer, but I will not be buying from them anymore."}
{"text":"Quite bad food. Pizza was over cheesed. Killed about 5 wasps. I'd go back for a take out order, but not really a great place to sit and have a nice meal."}
{"text":"I love love love The Big Slice.  You can't get anything better than this place: great pasta, garlicy-bread and fabulous pizza.  The service is great and its super kid friendly.  I always leave very happy with leftovers for home.  Best. Ever."}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing, always spot on with toppings. The panzarottis are very low priced, huge and very tasty with a lot of toppings.    I would definitely recommend the chicken wings (honey garlic is my go-to and they do it perfectly!) The classic chicken fingers and fries were also recommended by family I went out to eat with.  Service lacked at times during dine in service but overall extremely friendly, especially on the phone for placing deliveries."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place is listed as '$$' when it should be '$' $4 import beers, huge portions and really low prices!  The food is what it is, nothing amazing or jaw dropping but never really disappointing.   As long as u let the servers know you're sitting on the patio the service is timely.   Open til 1am weekdays, and 5am fri-sat it's a perfect local greasy spoon :)"}
{"text":"This place seemed homey at first and staff were welcomung but when I took a look at the pizza I ordered when I got home I noticed that the dough was barely cooked and all the toppings appeared to be in separate piles. The onions looked like they were the on on last minute, and I even asked for well done. Wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for years, it's good em the servers are super friendly and it's pretty cheap. We love coming here because the atmosphere is cozy and inviting. They are also open really late on the weekend which is an extra star"}
{"text":"If your looking for a family oriented pizza joint with good servings and relaxed atmosphere, then this is the place for you. The food certainly can't compete with the Italian place across the road but it doesn't have to."}
{"text":"Great service. The server was so nice. The big plate is the best deal in the city of Toronto. Great restaurant..reminds me of Italian restaurants in the United States..same concept. But this place is better."}
{"text":"The food is salty!!!!!  the bathrooms smell like urine.  I had a table near the bathroom once..and everythine that door opened all you could smell was piss..old piss...disgusting.  The prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"BIG PLATES ARE AMAZING! I got them for years but I just found out they took out the pizza choice! Pretty bummed about that since the place is called big slice. Overall staff is friendly and management too."}
{"text":"Pizza slices can be awesome depending who made them. The food at the hot table I would say \"avoid\".  The pasta dishes, the pasta is so over cooked it is like mashed.  But the slices can be good."}
{"text":"Pizza Libretto this ain't but it isn't exactly the same target market. For 11.99 plus tax you can get the \"the big plate\" which includes 4 of any of the following options like veal cutlets, lasagna, meatballs, ministrone, garden salad, different kinds of penne or a pizza slice. Its not delicate Italian , its italo-canadian and it sticks to the ribs. Pizza slices are marginal but the fresh personal and medium pizzas seem good.  Service and cleanliness are a bit shaky as well."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite Italian restaurant. Friendly and kind staff, the pizza I ordered was delicious, the smell of the food once you go inside will would want to order everything on the menu.   I can't wait for my next visit here, I plan on making sure I try out everything on their menu.   I would highly recommend everyone that loves Italian food to go to this restaurant, you won't be disappointed.  See you on this weekend Big slice"}
{"text":"Firstly and most importantly: This is the kind of place you go to more for the anticipation and excitement that eating gives you rather than for the actual tastebud sensations of the food.   You know when you're hungry and you want EVERYTHING.ON.THE.MENU and you want to eat for eternity? And the thought of eating until you're stuffed is making you deliriously happy? That is what this place gives you. Binge eaters, here is your heaven. I am talking about \"The Big Plate\". I am talking about $11.75, free garlic bread, and choosing 4 items out of approx. 15.   This is the Italian food version of the Mandarin: Not that great quality of food, you would never be satisfied with just one dish. This is quantity over quality.  If you want a real Italian Mandarin experience then for $23.50 (same-ish price as Mandarin) you could order EIGHT items from the menu. Pasta, meatballs, pizza, veal, lasagna, potatoes, chicken, sausage. It goes on. Whoa, nelly.   There's comfy booths or you can get take-out and binge eat in the privacy of your own home. No shame, pass the parm :) oh, and service was quick and if you ask for pop you get a can not garbage fountain pop."}
{"text":"I always come for the same dish every single time. Chicken fettucini Alfredo. Never disappoints! Decent price. The service lacks at times"}
{"text":"We haven't gone back here in two years so we decided we would go back. The food is still ok, prices are reasonable. The cleanliness is where it lacks. The woman's washroom, I went to open the door and its sticky. I wanted to wash my hands and the sink is flooded to the top with water. The toilets are disgusting and toilet paper all over the floor. Now I remember why I haven't been back in two years and I don't think I ever will go back go back."}
{"text":"Not the cleanest of places, but if you're craving a big slice of pizza, they do the job just fine. It's a great place to come with a big group. Their jumbo sized pizzas are pretty impressive. Overall, the taste is on par with pizza chains. But for the price, I would definitely come back again if I was in the area and had a serious craving for pizza."}
{"text":"My partner and I needed a place open on a late Tuesday night to eat, and luckily we found this gem in our neighbourhood! Oh my god, delicious food, amazing prices, lots of drink options - it is a student's dream! I wish I had discovered it earlier. Best of all, the service was great. Our waiter was so friendly and we stayed 15 minutes at the end just talking to him about school, art, and other things in general! I will be going back probably every week on those nights you just don't feel like cooking. I highly recommend it for everyone in the neighbourhood as your go to regular place for drinks or food."}
{"text":"So about 5 years ago I was taken there on a date. We really enjoyed the whole place. We have taken many people there over a 2.5 year time frame. About 2 years ago, my girlfriend now wife and I went for dinner. Food was average but the service and washrooms were the worst in the city. Tonight after many years we decided to try it ago. That was a BIG MISTAKE. The decor had changed but everything was still a big disappointment. Wings are 1/2 the size of old. Garlic bread to garlicky and cheese not really melted. Gnocchi was good. We told the waiter about how dirty the bathroom was and he said sorry. When he told to guy who I think was the owner, it looked like they just laughed and really didn't care. We will never go back. Will spend my money at places that care about their customers.  There are now a few really good late night diners in Toronto. I suggest we all try them and put this place to sleep."}
{"text":"My last trip here broke my heart. We've been ordering take out about weekly for work. It has always been five stars. You can get this thing called a big plate where you can pick four items and end up with enough food for three meals but you eat it all anyway and need to nap at work to avoid death. As an example, I often get a slice of pepperoni pizza, mushrooms, lasagna, and penne alfredo which they serve with garlic bread for some ungodly reason. The lasagna is always meaty, cheesy, and amazing. The pizza is thin and greasy and cheesy. The mushrooms are a big portion and good to balance out all the fat. You can also get chicken, veal, sausages, rice, whatever. Did I mention it's only $12?  Anyway, I went to dine in one day because I've loved everything I've eaten via take out before. It was like a different place. The pizza was overcooked to the point of being charred black, the crust was thick and flabby in the middle and the top was dry, none of the drippy grease I crave. Lasagna was super tiny, like a half of what they usually give me. I got rice instead of alfredo and it took up a full half of the plate. I don't need an entire half of a deep dish plate of plain rice, you could have saved the space and ripped me off less on the lasagna. I was so disappointed that I haven't been back since.  Three stars because it's always been flawless before. Hopefully next time will be back up to standard."}
{"text":"Walking down St. Clair looking for a patio, and came across this place randomly.  We both ordered a chicken Cutler sandwich, with a can of coke. Came up to around 18-20$.  Very filling, but somewhat lacking in flavour. The onions and peppers were cut into large squares, pieces kept sliding out.  A little sloppy for that price."}
{"text":"As highlighted by others, the big slice, is good, inexpensive and family friendly.  During the summer months, the patio on the side can be quite pleasant.  Do try a pizza, pasta or their panzos.  They are also open very late.  Unlike it's sister on Yonge street, it isn't full of loud drunks on weekends.  There may be some quiet drunks, but they are well behaved."}
{"text":"Usually the Big Slice Restauraunt was a go to hangout for evening meals. I brought my friends who were students here to enjoy some delicious well priced meals. We overlooked the disgusting bathrooms and the thuds of weights dropping on the ceilings (gym upstairs) because the food was cheap and delicious. My featured meal? The big plate. Indeed one of the best deals in Toronto. Now I have been here more times than I can count, I have dealt with the occasional rude waiter or two (95% of the waiters were great), I have dealt with the unhygenic practices -some to go servers would wipe the sweat off their upper lip and handle the food by hand without washing them after (needless to say that I never ordered to go anymore.) I still cared for the owners and the waitresses and it was close by and well priced so I continued to frequent the place. I walked in quite recently and asked for the big plate- the waiter was kind enough to inform me that they have taken out one of the courses included in the meal and were charging more for the plate. I was left dissapointed. I would understand especially at this time making the price higher OR taking an item away but to do both was absurd. Wont be frequenting them anymore sadly. Many memories were made in this place, its a shame to leave."}
{"text":"I had the meat lasagna, and 2 glasses of house red.  The 3 staff I dealt with were all very nice.  The lasagna was large and came with a very good not-small salad and two large pieces of garlic bread.  While this is not great quality, it was still yummy and filling, and for the price and good service it has instantly become my go-to Italian local.  Bonus: big patio."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great good, reasonable price, a server that's SMOKING hot. Everything! I particularly like the Greek salad, the beef lasagna, and the mushroom/pepper/onion combo. Wowza! The atmosphere is open and inviting for families, but not overly loud, so it isn't off-putting."}
{"text":"First impression:  It's a bit of a shit hole inside. I  won't lie about that. It's not the kinda place you go to for the interior. It was also chilly. Lots of mounted tv's on the wall ...  It was full of families sitting around, quickly shoving food in their mouths, while watching tv.  I'll sum this up by saying it's a very casual restaurant.   What I got: - Veal sandwich w/cheese and mushrooms. Notes: The mushrooms are kept whole (and they're NOT CANNED!), which provides an extra boost of flavour. My mouth enjoyed it, a lot. The bread was on the soggy* side, but the veal was tender,  so well seasoned, I barely noticed the soggy-ish bun.  I also liked that it didn't all squeeze out. It was a nice compact eat.   *I did get take out, so the food sat for a good 30 minutes during my ride home, prior to eating.   Panzerotti- cheese & pepperoni.  YESSS!! This was really freakin' good. Mine was made to order. it was a 15-ish minute wait.  Super fresh. Super yummy. And it's super huge.   I happen to be a big fan of the dough they use for the panzo, so it goes without saying I thought it was delish.    As a word of Caution:  The washrooms. Yeah, I wouldn't go in there if I were you.  I learned my lesson."}
{"text":"Perfect for take-out when you have a salt/carb craving.   I get a craving for Big Slice about every 6-8 weeks!  Also great hangover food, obviously.  I would not eat-in at the restaurant, generally, unless I had to (or was drunk - they are open SUPER late for this very reason).... take-out is better for me.  I usually just walk in the side entrance and order at the counter & wait (10 minutes on average for my order to be ready)... you can also call ahead.  And they deliver!  I think the minimum is $15 for that.  Again, good for hangover days.  I like the pizza slices, it's good to get a slice when I have a pizza craving and don't want to order a whole pie.  The slices are BIG! ...and have lots of toppings.  The last Hawaiian slice I had had SO much ham that it was actually a bit much.  One slice from Big Slice is def enough to fill me up.  I take it home and shake on some FRANK'S hot sauce... nom nom nom  Mostly, I order the Tortellini or the Ravioli with Rose sauce, or sometimes the spaghetti with meatballs.  You can also get a Big Plate to go, which is awesome if you want to make your own concoction  (i.e. 4 of whatever - Penne with whatever sauce you want, mushrooms, onions, veal cutlet, lasagna, meatballs, potatoes, sausage, slice of pizza, etc etc...)  I've never ordered a whole pizza, never tried the wings or panzerotti, and I don't really bother with the salads, so I can't speak to that.  I've had the Veal cutlet sandwich many times too, and it's exactly what you'd expect - yummy and messy.  I usually need a nap after eating one of those.   It's NOT gourmet, but who cares. It's one of those places that you can get hooked on, and then you are theirs for life!  It's the Big Slice and I hope it never goes anywhere!!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised the overall score is not higher. We live in Ajax but come here once a month or so. Pizza slices are fantastic, any pasta dish is great but the vodka penne is the best. Nice family type restaurant and always full of energy. This Big Slice location is NOT the same experience as the dive that used to be on Yonge and College (even though those slices were the best at the time)."}
{"text":"This place is only good if you are coming out of a bar after last call. They seem to realize this and take full advantage by staying open until 5am on Fridays and Saturdays. The owner is a complete jerk who seems to have trained his staff to be annoyed that there are any customers there. I had to give it to stars though because through some miracle the place does have the greatest poutine I've been able to  find in Ontario.  They hand cut the fries and they bring white cheese curds straight in from Montreal.  They don't call it poutine for some reason though so when you go there be sure to ask for \"fascina.\""}
{"text":"The first time I went to Big Slice was late on a Friday night. This place seems any time I walk by it day or night, so if you need your fix of Italian food at odd hours, this is your joint. The first thing I tried here was the lasagne and garden salad. Unfortunately, this was not their best showing. The lasagne lacked any flavour, other than salt salt salt. The salad was super greasy and drenched in dressing. I have been back since because it's super convenient and a great value and I've discovered the secret....it was in the name the whole time...get the big slice! The vegetarian pizzas are gigantic, full of peppers, tomatoes and mushrooms. Even with all these toppings, the crust manages to stay structurally sound and it gets an extra bake when it's re-heated for take-out (which is usually what I get). Don't come here looking for gourmet, come here for the Big Slice as the name implies."}
{"text":"My husband and I always share the \"Big Plate\" here, $11.75 for 4 items and 2 pieces of garlic bread. We usually order the beef lasagne, penne Alfredo, a \"Big Slice\" (get it? ) of pepperoni pizza, and a sausage.  The portion is generous, and we always leave here full and satisfied.  Food is good, price is great, staff is friendly, atmosphere is casual.  We like coming here whenever we are craving for some carb."}
{"text":"While it is a little crappy inside, I didn't mind because it has a certain...je ne sais quoi that is homey and comforting. Seems like a little place that people in the neighbourhood have been going to for years, like a little hole-in-the-wall hidden gem. I had the grilled veggie sandwich (that has goat cheese...*drool*) and it was delicious!! The price wasn't too steep either ($4.95) so that was a win. I had a taste of my friend's veal sandwich and it was fabulous - not the best I've ever had but nothing to dismiss either.  I'd definitely go back in the future."}
{"text":"Three stars??? Seriously way better than that. The calzones are excellent and the sauces are all homemade and very delicious. We've been coming to big slice for years. Recommend lunch or dinner as the late night crowd can get a bit dicey. This is place is a gem."}
{"text":"Good food for the price! My favourite is the penne a la vodka, though I'm always torn between that and the Big Plate. The portions don't look so big when placed in front of you but it sure fills you up, but you can always bring the leftovers home.  I love coming here for late night munchies since it's open late."}
{"text":"Three stars for pizza slice (when fresh): good value although a little oily Two stars for the veal sandwich: veal was tough, sauce was insufficient and tasteless. Other food is reasonably priced, though I'd pass if it was all the same quality as the veal sandwich.  I'll prob try something else on the menu since I live so close. Open til 2 am... every night I think. I'll round up to three because its about what I would expect from a place like this."}
{"text":"Don't bother even going in. The pizza is terrible, the pasta tasted like it was out of a can, and the staff, in Italian, make fun of the customers. When I asked him, in Italian, why he doesn't say it in English if he felt so strongly, his eyes nearly popped out of his head and he ran into the back like the coward he is. Since the business thinks of their customers so poorly, don't give them any business, the locals aren't."}
{"text":"Horrible. Awful. Inedible. Abysmal service. Those are the most generous things I have to say about my experience.  Went with a group of 4 friends. We had tried to go to  few other places, but they were all full with long waits.   We went to big slice. Food took forever to come. Food was awful.   Everyone got sick later that night.  (This was about 3 years ago)  How is this still open???????"}
