{"text":"She refused to give me a plate for my food. I ordered two combo for two people. She said I should use the plates I got. She forgot my order. The food was bland.  Never coming back. $5.99 for a main, soup and bad service. She said I don't need to use so many plates.   :/"}
{"text":"Been going to this place for years. The hakka chow mein  is delicious and so is the chili chicken.  The best part is the hot sauce that's home made.  Fabulous place."}
{"text":"I go here with my mom and sister all the time. Great food for vegetarians. I recommend their chili paneer (dry) and veggie manchurian (gravy) as well as their corn soup."}
{"text":"Worst place.. food smells fun .. rude waiters.. shabby place..they mess up orders ..never going back .. I suggest no one goes there"}
{"text":"Pleasant family-oriented restaurant with friendly service and delicious food. Their chilli chicken and manchurian vegetable leave little to be desired."}
{"text":"I remember eating here a few years ago and it was pretty decent. Quality seems to have gone down the drain over the years and my most recent experience left me saying \"Meh\"."}
{"text":"Good food, but bad attitude. They could be little bit nicer to people.   Love their chilli chicken and hakka noodle. Pakoras are not that great and could use some work (too much dough, no chicken)."}
