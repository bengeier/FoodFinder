{"text":"When I saw this was opening, I was hoping for a cool diner experience, like the Holy Grill, Belmont or even Nellies, but it's set up and priced more like a high end restaurant.
If they step up and listen to their customers, they may do OK, but time will tell. they opened in a family area but there's really not much for kids to order.  We were going to leave due to not finding anything for the kids to eat, and the manager was kind enough to open up the lunch menu for us to choose from, which was nice, but then never came back and checked on anything from there on, I would have thought they would be looking for feedback being a new place and all.

Food was pretty good, Burger and fries were great, although expensive, Chicken and Waffles tasty and Mac and cheese tasty but also expensive."}
{"text":"I had the trout sandwich and sorbet. The food tasted very fresh. The trout was perfectly done. The sorbet was perfectly sweet. There is lots of room for groups."}
{"text":"The food was great. I had the portobello mushroom Hollandaise. It was fresh tasting, creative and delicious. I also tasted some of the burger, which was delicious. I would order both again. The atmosphere is very inviting. There's beautiful art on the wall. The staff was friendly and helpful. This is a new restaurant and I appreciated their openness to feedback."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner last night with a friend. Very nice to have a clean, friendly diner in the Kingsland area again! Server was efficient and knowledgeable. Decor features some lovely artwork from local artists. (Restrooms were impeccable). The menu features locally sourced range-free eggs and meats, organic, seasonal fruits and veggies. As it was my first visit I tried their signature  D'VINE BURGER: ($16) organic beef, haystack onion rings, roasted jalapeno, bacon, mozzarella, tangy bbq sauce (the sauces are made in-house). It was everything you could want in a burger, in fact, it was so big I only ate one half of the bun! I ordered the sweet potato fries (delish) but wanted to try the 'regular' fries as well, so the server had the chef throw a handful on my plate - nice and crispy - just the way I like them. My friend ordered the \"Meatloaf Scrambler\", a special of the day. Judging by the way she cleaned her plate, I'd say it was a success! Nice ambiance, good service, great food. Will go back and try the 'all-day' brunch menu."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped in here for one last breakfast in Calgary on a whim.  We were not disappointed in the quality or quantity of food.   She had the traditional eggs benny and I an omelette; both had great presentation and were very tasty.  The meal came quick and the server was very friendly.   

The restaurant was clean and quiet.   Just was at we wanted for a Friday breakfast, but I can only imagine what a little gem like this is like on a weekend.   

We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Totally mediocre. This is the type of restaurant that has four different kinds of eggs Benedict on the menu but serves their eggs over medium rather than poached. The hash browns are just potato wedges... The feature (expensive) parts of the dishes are served sparingly (very few berries on the berry waffles.... Short hollandaise etc). The small fruit bowls are pre cut days before... Everything is just very mediocre."}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed that this diner closed.  It was nice having a diner close to home that didn't have crazy wait times and lines, and also wasn't a chain.  The first few times we went here, the food and service were great.  At some point, the ownership noticeably changed - the food and service was not as good, and the restaurant smelled of sewage.  It's now changed names - sad that it didn't work out!"}
{"text":"This just opened up in our neighbourhood so thought we would stop by for dinner. All three of us had the burger and it was delicious! Topped with thin crispy onion rings, cheese, tasty BBQ sauce and arugula. The bun was nicely toasted. Nice inside too. So close to home we will be able to walk here!"}
{"text":"What a great change this place has undergone. Had the meatloaf and my wife had the lamb very very good food in a fresh artful surrounding. Highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Service is soooooooo slow.... It was not very busy and we waited at least half an hour just to get breakfast... It didn't seem like a server issue but a kitchen issue. When the table beside me who sat down after us got their food I had enquirer input ours. \"There's only one cook back there\" well that seems like an easy fix to me. 

Anyways got our breakfast and my wife and I were both very disappointed. The menu looked so delicious and she was very interested in the gluten free options. 

I ordered the smoked salmon Bennie. Potatoes were burnt and bland. The bread that it was on was stale and the salmon came out warm and did not taste fresh at all. 

My wife ordered a gluten free waffle with berries and was underwhelmed... It was very small for the price and really lacked freshness.... 

This place cannot compete with some of the other great diners in this city simply based on food quality but if your interested in a franchise the owner is looking

Would not go back."}
{"text":"Two times we have been, the first 'D'vine' the second, total
service and kitchen dysfunction.
The good news, you can definitely get a table here at peak brunch times and they have a patio, but you may never receive a refill of coffee, the syrup for your chicken and waffles, and the wrong eggs on your meal.

Still new, still rocky, a 14 year old bus boy, but the servers are all really nice, just no one is designated to one table and everyone is trying to cover all aspects of service, but somehow still missing everything."}
