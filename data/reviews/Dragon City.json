{"text":"I'm amazed that this place has gotten good reviews.
It is absolute crap.
Do not bother wasting your money on this food it is extremely disappointing.  I guess if you want decent Chinese food you need to drive 2-3 hours to the Chicagoland area where even the worst place would be better than this.
sigh..."}
{"text":"This place earns a solid three stars for decent cheap Chinese take out and friendly service. They're a little better than Chang Jiang but sadly they don't deliver. It's run by a family and sometimes the kids are there doing their homework, so I like to support this small local business."}
{"text":"As an Asian, I like to try Asian food restaurant first every where I go.
I went there to have lunch the first time I arrived in Verona for a week of work.
I ordered a stir fry rice noodles, she was rude and the beef tasted weird,  I believe its spoiled or far from fresh. and the noodle was tasteless, trust me, I m not a picky person, 
I never finished half of the plate. terrible. I hope they improve !!"}
{"text":"We enjoy the food we \"take out\" from here. The owners are always pleasant and our orders are always \"spot on\". We especially like the General's tofu, house special ho fun & crab Rangoon. Bottom line:Family owned & operated little biz with nice take out in a small town."}
{"text":"Here is the \"jist\"
1.  Not friendly.  No greeting.  No smile.  Just \"what do you want?\".  Fine - not the end of the world but duly noted.
2. After I ordered, I sat to wait and started looking around.  This place is DIRTY!  The floor wasn't swept, there was splattering all over the walls and the bathrooms looked like they haven't been cleaned in weeks.  The kitchen looked decently organized but I couldn't get a good look at that.  
2. I probably would have walked out but I had already paid, so I thought I would at least give the food a try.  Bad choice.  Won ton soup broth was good, but the dumpling meat was like a hockey puck. The crab rangoon was mediocre at best.  For the chicken and vegetables - the chicken tasted freezer burnt but here was a nice amount of vegetables that seemed nice.  The brown sauce had little flavor though.  Even the chips for the soup tasted stale.  
In the end, I took a couple bites of everything to give it a fair shot, but between the lack of cleanliness and food taste - threw about 98% of the food away.  

Very disappointing - I am always looking for good chinese and this one isn't far from me so I was hopeful.  Oh well."}
{"text":"I agree with Matt Z.  The food is definitely Chinese American, but it well done Chinese American.  The food comes hot and there is plenty of it.  Very good value."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Dragon City several times.   I usually eat there, rather than get take out.  The food is well prepared and usually it has been quite good.  My wife likes their garlic chicken better than from anywhere else in Dane Co.  They serve large portions for reasonable prices.  I recommend it to friends all the time."}
{"text":"Good hot sour soup and eggrolls.  I did not care for the style of chicken in the cashew chicken, it was fried and either breaded or with skin.  Tons of cashews, which is refreshing as most places like to skimp.  They pack in a lot of food with a side of pork fried rice.

I would try again with one of their 'healthy' dishes or all veggie dishes."}
{"text":"Hey, I'm a fan, but you have to judge this place based on what it is: a classic American-Chinese food joint in a strip mall that specializes in take-away. If you accept that going in you won't be disappointed (and I think it's better than many other similar options in the Madison area). If you're inclined for spicy food, ask them to turn it up a notch, I find the spiciness levels to be underestimated. 

I've only eaten in the restaurant once, but I would suggest getting takeout and eating at home--atmosphere is a bit lacking. Servings are generous, we always end up with leftovers! Really, not much more to say. If this kind of Chinese food is what you're looking for, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I like to judge a chinese restaurant by their shrimp fried rice.  It tells me how good their chef is with flavor, how fresh the ingredients are since it is seafood, and how powerful the wok is to get that nice finish for the fried rice.

The shrimp was mushy and old, the rice was not flavorful.  Second time I've come here.  I was not impressed the first time around, and definitely not impressed this time when I tried to give it another chance.  Too bad, damn..."}
{"text":"I order beef fried rice, beef and snow pea pods and two pork egg roles. The portions were good but the egg roll was small and had little filling in it. Wish there was more to it as it wasn't a bad egg role. The beef fried rice was kind of bland and I could find no trace of egg in  it as well as little beef, but it did have carrots, peas and onion which was good. The beef with snow pea pods was ok, but I didn't care for the beef which was so tenderizes with a product that it was like eating already digested meat. The texture just isn't right. Good balance of water chestnuts, mushrooms, pea pods etc. The sauce had a strange  smokey after taste such as you would get from using liquid smoke, which seemed weird for Chinese. Needless to say the food overall was very average and I'm still looking for that really good Chinese restaurant in the Verona, Madison area."}
{"text":"Finally! A great Chinese lunch spot. It's got that cozy / dive feel but the food is fresh and tasty. I love eating here."}
{"text":"First,  I like hole-in-the-wall restaurants.  This is one of those in a small,  older strip in an up &  coming area in Verona. If you want friendly,  and that's import to you,  you will be dearly disappointed.  Very matter-of-fact service.  Think a smile might have exercised muscles the owner has never used.  But... I ordered a chicken with garlic combo to take back to the hotel. It was good,  really good.  Right amount of chicken with crisp veggies and tasty sauce.  Fried rice not overly greasy. Egg roll small,  but good.  Pleasant surprise,  really. And right across from my hotel!"}
{"text":"A hole-in-the-wall joint on Verona's main drag, Dragon City serves the town (and employees of the giant nearby software corporation) quickly, deliciously, and inexpensively.  As a former employee of the aforementioned software company, Dragon City was worth at least a weekly trip, two if it was a particularly rough week and late work nights and hunger pangs sent me on an evening food run or two.  

Now that I no longer live in the Madison area, I sometimes find myself craving their sesame chicken and vegetable egg rolls, and the exceptionally low price of $4.25 for their lunch specials.  Where on earth can you get a full meal (or two if you're a light eater) of coma-inducing Chinese food?  While I admit that if I were to search hard enough, I'd find somewhere in Houston that has similar prices and food, there are so many Chinese food restaurants that it'd be a lengthy search indeed.  Dragon City required absolutely no effort to find, so while the food is four-star worthy (I love fried rice, and theirs is pretty mediocre), I added one for convenience.  Call your order in and it's ready to go in 10 minutes. Take 20 minutes to eat, and then spend the next four hours trying to be productive while every ounce of energy your body can muster is working against your ambition to put you into the deepest of slumbers.  

I also shouldn't fail to mention that the staff are very friendly, and had a pretty good idea of what I'd be ordering when they heard my voice on the phone or saw me come through the door.  

If I ever find myself in the Madison area again, I certainly won't skip on a lunch special at Dragon City."}
{"text":"For fast food Chinese this place is really quite good.  They don't skimp on the chicken like some places do and the flavors are pretty good.  Always hot and totally inexpensive.  I give 4 stars because I think the flavor could be better on some dishes.
Went back recently.   Food flavor was not as good as in the past.  I've had much better Chinese food from other places over the past two years.   We hardly go here anymore.   I lower them 1 star to three now as it is ok in a pinch."}
{"text":"I had a lunch menu here a couple of months ago.  Not impressed, as a matter of fact recommend staying away.  But reading reviews, people are speaking better of the place.  May have to give it a second chance.  1 star until I can eat there again.  Prices very affordable!"}
{"text":"I stayed at the hotel across the street, so it was a short walk to the establishment. I ordered the sweet and sour chicken combo which comes with pork fried rice and an egg roll. Didn't have to wait long at all, maybe 5-7 minutes after I ordered. The meal was pretty standard as takeout Chinese food goes. It had a large portion, enough for two meals. The egg roll wasn't fabulous but I'm usually picky about egg rolls so I don't hold it against them. The sweet and sour sauce for the chicken was pretty thin (watery) and I'm used to something a little thicker. The chicken tasted fine on its own or dipped in something else (mustard and duck sauce). I put soy sauce on the rice and it tasted same as any other pork fried rice  Overall it wasn't bad and I will return on my next visit."}
{"text":"Didn't care for this place during my last visit. I ordered the beef fried rice and it didn't have any flavor. 

Also, I needed an itemized receipt to expense the purchase and couldn't get it."}
{"text":"If you're looking for \"real\" Chinese food, best go elsewhere.  That aside, this is one of my favorite joints for good \"American\" Chinese.

The place isn't large, more or less a hole in the wall.  The staff is pretty friendly and is quick to get your food ready when it's not busy.  However, they do struggle to keep up with a number of customers when it's busier. Be prepared to wait a while (never more than 30 min).  Decor is complete with the manager's daughter and her TV. Fun!  Don't expect to bring larger groups here, as the place seats 20 at the most, and even then, it's a squeeze.

The food is pretty good and is consistently so.  Have been there 10+ times and never disappointed.  You can expect plenty of sauce on your giant amount of chicken/beef/whatever with a solid side of rice (white or fried, your choice).  

Lunch specials are hard to pass up at a whopping $5.01 for a drink and a hefty helping of whatever you ordered.  Don't see what you want on the lunch menu?  No problem - just ask them for it, they've been happy to comply.

We've also done dinner for a group before and the amount of food we got was massive.  The bag alone weighed close to 15 lbs.  

Worth a try!"}
{"text":"I was in town for work and decided to try this spot since it was right across from the hotel. I had the sesame chicken and house fried rice. Both were just basic. The sesame chicken was more gristle and breading than chicken, and the house fried rice seemed like it was thawed and quickly scrambled to order. Skimpy chicken shreds, no savory flavors that you normally get from wok-fried onions, eggs and veggies. I definitely will skip this spot next time I'm in town..."}
