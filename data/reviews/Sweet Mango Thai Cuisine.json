{"text":"I love Thai food, and this restaurant does not disappoint!

I always get their vegetable red curry dish (spicy); so good that I crave it!

Their presentation of food is really pretty, the staff is really nice (takeout and eat in), and I agree with previous reviews-the restaurant is really clean! 
My boyfriend was turned on to Thai food after eating here. 

Also if you live closer to Seven Hills- Charm Thai is very similar- the owners of both places are friends and moved to Cleveland from Boston (fun little fact)  I extend my royalties to both places!"}
{"text":"The country pad Thai was delicious. Quick and pleasant service. Very quiet atmosphere at 4:00 on a Sunday. 4 other people in the restaurant and had to whisper. Not very intimate.  Nothing special."}
{"text":"I have eaten here numerous times and done takeout even more.  I truly enjoy the pad thai, pot stickers, crazy noodles and beef macadamia are my most ordered.  Always top notch and great tasting.  All of my friends agree that this place is a winner when it comes to thai!"}
{"text":"Delightful.  We enjoyed the mussamum chicken and mango curry."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good food, definitely recommend. None spicy pad Thai resulted in only 4 stars"}
{"text":"Not a huge Thai fan, but really did enjoy the visit to Sweet Mango.  It's a welcome change to the Chinese restaurant that previously occupied this location.

I enjoyed their Pad Thai and thought the service was on par.

Nothing negative to report on my Sweet Mango visit.  I also understand they're opening a Berea location closer to Baldin Wallace College."}
{"text":"I love thai food and I do like this place. The portions are kinda small and its a little bit more pricey compared to other Thai places we've been to. But it's close to home."}
{"text":"Service was a little bizarre! We got there before 5 and were the only ones there but still had to wait awhile for a table because the hostess was on the phone. We thought maybe they were short-staffed so early, but as soon as we sat down, we had more than one waitress asking if we wanted more drinks or different drinks and more food or different food.

Other than that: great! I love the Crazy Noodles."}
{"text":"getting worse I think
Food wasnt fresh that I complaint to the restaurant and I hope they will take a lesson that way they will lose more customer

they might save some money by using refresh stuff but business will get lost finally

I will try one more time!!"}
{"text":"This place is barely a 2.5 should be a 2 honestly.I had the mango fried rice lunch with a tom yum soup.The rice was ok kind of a burnt taste and not a very good sized portion.The soup was awful and had a very bad smell to it.For the price I would never return I get the same thing at Thai Chili in Avon Lake which the food is authentic as it can get and huge portions for $10.50 this came to 14.55"}
{"text":"I will say they have very kind waitresses and a pleasant dining environment!  But smiles only go so far when you label yourself as a cuisine...

Larb salad was tremendously salty (couldn't finish the plate) and the Tom khar soup was quite bland. Mushrooms seemed uncooked and the broth lacked any spiciness one would expect.  Traditionally, this soup should awaken senses...at best it was a sweet cream with a hint of coconut. 

I had found myself turned off from food after a few tastes of both.  Not sure how two staple items on the menu were ill-prepared.  The food was brought out very quickly but in hindsight - not sure if that was a good thing.

Other members of my dining party had two other dishes rice and equally felt it was bland relative to other Thai eats we've had.  Not sure how the ratings are so high...or we just caught em on a downslide.

Would not be going back for Thai here, sorry..."}
{"text":"Oh my god, this place is so good!  If I had my last meal on earth, it would have to be Sweet Mango.  If food could be Zen, that is how I would describe Sweet Mango.  I feel like I am at peace whenever I eat at this place.  Food has the perfect balance of flavors, great portion sizes, and beautiful presentation to complete the dish.  Every time I eat here my body is like thank you, thank you for doing something good for yourself.  Service is also top notch every time!  This is easily the best Thai I have ever had, and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is our spot for Thai! Now that they deliver, we eat it at least once a week. The Pad Thai and Cowboy Pad Thai are very tasty! My husband likes the Siam fried rice. I also love the yellow curry. The potstickers and fried ice cream are also very yummy. We enjoy the atmosphere at the restaurant as well. There are fresh flowers on the table and the staff is very nice."}
{"text":"They have the best fried rice! The portions are smaller and prices are higher compared to others, but the quality and service is above others! Everyone at sweet mango is very friendly! Very good for take out too!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in NE Ohio.  The food is awesome and the presentation is beautiful.  You can't go wrong with any selection but our favorites are Phad Thai Country Style, Red Curry and duck.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came here after reading the yelp reviews and I was not disappointed. The crazy noodles here are just about as amazing as they can get. Always have gotten fantastic service here!"}
{"text":"This is THE Thai place in CLE for the freshest, tastiest, most colorful food ever.  We even took the owner to Thailand with us so he could choose where we ate, he seasoned our food, ordered for us, it was the best foodie vacation you can imagine!!!  His soft shell crab appetizer and the bird's nest entree are worth calling ahead for and requesting, in case they aren't featured on the daily special.

The food can be ordered as spicy or mild as you prefer.  Nick, the owner, is very approachable and wants to make sure you enjoy your meal so you tell others.  Expect a line on weekends."}
{"text":"Love the food here and had never had poor service until today, which was a bummer. Been here a number of time and I love there Pad thai, crazy noodles ( nice and spicy) and bubble teas. But I'm sorry I can't take it when my server is YAWNING while taking our order and keeps saying \"no problem\" to anything and everything we say. Once or twice sure but overall it just seemed disrespectful.  And this may just be me but I just don't like being called dude and \"hey guys\" from my server, especially when the table is a bunch of girls. I don't want to nick pick the guy, he just seemed to not care or be paying any sort of attention. 
 
Overall though the food is really great and fresh with decent pricing and sizing. I often go to  Thai Origin in Middleburg because it's a bit closer and they have really great sushi but they are a bit more expensive and the portion aren't as generous. 

So Overall Food is excellent, atmosphere is asian inspired, not modern but open and inviting. Would of gotten 5 stars if not for ding bat server."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch when I was in the area.  Very busy place.  Service is excellent.  Seafood Coconut soup is so good.  Pad Thai was wonderful."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and well-prepared (I ordered the red curry and tempura veggies).  The service was also fantastic.  I never had to ask for a refill or try to get the server's attention.  Everyone was very friendly, as well. The place was spotless and the atmosphere was calm and relaxing.  I was deinitely impressed!"}
{"text":"The best Thai around Cleveland area

I tried charm Thai lemon glass sweet mango and I  forgot the name in coventry Rd and Tremont area

Sweet mango is hands down number one thai

Try their regular pad Thai and make it spicy it is much better than country style pad thai

Tom yangkoong is super bomb and basil fried rice you can't go wrong with it"}
{"text":"Great Thai! The dinning room isn't that snappy but the staff is great. Best place for authentic Thai that is upscale."}
{"text":"I been to alot of Thai restaurants in Cleveland. I think its ok. The parking lot is very small and the restaurant is equally smaller than expected. Food was not bad, but the menu is the same as Mint Cafe in Cleveland Heights.  For people living in Strongsville, this is a good place so they don't have to go to Cleveland Heights.  I think the food is much better over there because of the competition."}
{"text":"Delicious thai food, but I usually leave not 100% full. Maybe just a touch more food would be nice, or if you split an appetizer it would be good."}
{"text":"a group of friends and i went to get lunch there, they got a noodle dish (which was good i tried it) i got beef and broccoli, the sauce for my food was much too salty, and my beef felt rubbery and the broccoli tasted like it wasn't done enough. all though the rice was amazing i don't think ill be coming back."}
{"text":"This is the first place I am going to when I visit strongsville. I have heard great things, hearing ravings reviews from people in new York. The pad Thai is a delicacy that is just eat. Lastly the bubble tea, definitely better than the ones you get in kung fu tea house."}
{"text":"A decent local place. Good prices. I got the pad Thai country style - a spicy version of pad Thai and it was a little too saucy for me. But good flavors and we enjoyed the meal. We also got the summer rolls as an appetizer (great!) and my husband got a beef stir fry -which he enjoyed."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place. It's one of our favorites. The food is always fresh and well presented. The servers are very friendly and accommodating. The food comes surprisingly fast. Authentic and excellent!  Great place for date night!  

Www.spousedates.com"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. And a cool staff. I like a staff that can joke around and make things a little lighthearted yet stay very professional."}
{"text":"This place serve some of the best Thai cuisine in the area. Well I really do need to broaden my menu I personally love the mango fried rice and the deals at lunch make it worth your while! Stop by you"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding!!  You are always greeted pleasantly and seated promptly.   The servers are always friendly and know the menu items well.  The selection of food is very diverse.  The presentation of the food is like no other I've seen, it's always beautiful and very eye appealing.  I've had everything from their seafood to their tofu entrees and all of them are delicious!  You can also adjust the spicyness of some of the entrees.  The owner of the Sweet Mango stops by every time we are there, asking how everything is, and is always very friendly.  We have taken several people there and they have also enjoyed it.  The price for the entree is just right and you get a very nice portion.  I also like the fact that you can get brown rice instead of white rice.  This is one of our \"go to\" resteraunts."}
{"text":"Clean and serene spot. Everyone very nice. Food great. We never had Thai but it was not intimidating. Highly recommend.  Generous portions at really reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today. The service & food were excellent! Although after initially trying their Thai Custard, I wasn't sure if it was meant to be hot or cold. 

My Mom & I are not a fan of spicy food, so they were able to make our dishes mild for us. And, the waitress was very helpful with helping us decide what kind of noodle dish to try. 

I hope it wasn't a fluke, because I am already dying to go back there!"}
{"text":"Crazy awesome every time! Country pad thai  is my favorite but the bangkok beef curry is also amazing! Great service every time!"}
{"text":"Been here many times. Absolutely love it. The staff are very friendly and attentive. The service is great and the price is right. Ive never had a bad experience here. I give it 2 thumbs up for sure. Love love love the vegetable curry I had and the spring rolls with peanut sauce were the shiz. I will be a loyal customer"}
{"text":"My family and I absolutely love this place and have been going there for years. Service is always great. They set the bar for Thai food. I especially love their Pad Thai and Basil Beef."}
{"text":"Another great lunch place in Strongsville!

Been here a bunch of time's with co-workers, been great every time!  I'm not a huge \"Thai\" guy, but I'm always open to trying new things... so I get something different each time I'm here.  I love the Bubble Tea!"}
{"text":"Avacodo curry is to die for.  Yum!!!  Love this place!!!  Sticky rice with mango and coconut ice cream is a great desert choice as well."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE Sweet Mango: 

First of all, you MUST try the bubble tea. I prefer the Green Tea, it is extremely delicious. Even if you are scared of the tapioca balls, you still will enjoy the Green Tea part. 

Whenever I eat here, the experience is always pleasant. The staff is very attentive. 
It is a small eatery, which is also quiet. Perfect for an intimate dinner. 

I order the small salad with peanut sauce-I tried to recreate the sauce and I can never make it as good as Sweet Mango. So0o0o0o good. 

When your dish comes to the table, it will have an ornate food flower, which always makes me happy. 

Their duck is always extremely tasty, but I crave the seafood delight. It is a great mix of different sea foods and the sauce is something that I want to swim in-I enjoy it that much. 

Great experience, you should probably go there right now."}
{"text":"I have waited for this day for a long time - a thai place right in Strongsvile. It is a bit small and at 1:45 on a Sunday it was hard to get a seat...but the food is excellent. They make it to order. Tempura is crispy and light. Veggie & tofu pad thai tastes fresh and the tofu is baked! I also tried the red curry with tofu with brown rice. It was a very healthy and filling meal. Kudos for presentation of all the dishes. So excited to visit my parents again. I know my mom might end up moving next door... :)"}
{"text":"First time here, the food was fantastic and resonably priced.  We had the chicken satay, potstickers, crazy Noodles and Siam Fried rice. We requested 2 stars for the spicy level, which has a good amount of kick. The staff was extremely friendly!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been rated as the #1 Thai restaurant in the area and the #2 best restaurant in Strongsville overall, and there's a good reason for that! This will be a detailed review so let me start with some context: I am a military veteran who has lived all over the country and overseas, and in doing so, I have eaten Thai food at dozens of different Thai restaurants around the world; some good, some bad, and two that were absolutely phenomenal! \"Sweet Mango Thai Cuisine\" is the best Thai restaurant I have ever eaten at in the country, followed by a place called \"D Asian Thai\" in Fort Worth, Texas.

Since discovering this restaurant back in 2012, I have eaten here regularly, at least once per week and sometimes more. The menu offers a great selection of authentic Thai entrees, all customizable in terms of how spicy you prefer. Of course, you don't need to specify a spiciness level at all; you can simply order right off the menu and they will make it exactly as described on the menu.

My personal favorite: Mango Fried Rice, 10-star spice level, also known as \"Thai hot.\" I would NOT suggest ordering something at the 10-star spice level unless you are obsessed with spicy foods like I am. I order it as \"Chicken Mango Fried Rice, 10-star\" because I prefer mine with chicken only, instead of the default chicken and shrimp that normally comes with it.

The Basil Fried Rice is also outstanding and for a nice kick that intensifies the flavor, I recommend ordering it a little spicier, probably 3-star or 4-star. If you like spicy food and want a good starting point that you can work up from, order any of the fried rice dishes as 4-star.

The waitresses and waiters at Sweet Mango Thai Cuisine are friendly and check on you throughout your meal to see if you need anything such as drink refills. Whenever I've eaten here or picked up a carry-out order, I've never observed anyone upset with their waitress or waiter. This place does get busy around 7:00 P.M. so keep that in mind when planning your trip. There's never really a wait, at least not for more than a few minutes but it does get packed later in the evening so get there earlier than 7:00 P.M. if you can.

In terms of beverages, they offer regular and diet sodas, Thai iced tea, water, and a selection of beer and spirits.

One thing I should mention that I didn't know until recently when I noticed it on the menu is they use only 100% vegetable oil, low sodium soy sauce, and for those of you concerned with food containing MSG, the menu says none of their food contains it so don't worry.

The owners: Over the years, I have become friends with Nick and Jan, the husband and wife team who own the place, as well as most of the waitresses and waiters. Nick and Jan are great people with a lot of knowledge about Thailand and the country's cuisine, having lived there for many years before coming to the U.S. almost 20 years ago. I think they opened this restaurant back in 2007 or 2008 when Nick relocated to Cleveland from Boston. They live here in Strongsville so this is a locally owned restaurant! Support your neighbors! :-)

Anyway, give this place a try if you haven't been here yet and let them know you heard about their restaurant from Paul! :-) Enjoy!

UPDATE: *** The restaurant is not affiliated with the Sweet Mango restaurant in Berea although their menus are fairly similar. The Berea location is small and cramped and their customer service is nowhere as nice as the real Sweet Mango in Strongsville. ***"}
{"text":"\"EnThaising\"

Intro:  We found this place on a whim and it was definitely a jewel.  When I go to the Cleveland area, I'm usually in Norwalk, which is an hour outside of Cleveland.  Therefore, I have very limited eating options.  I was happy to see this place on Yelp had good reviews, but I was a little leery because people in the Midwest are nicer than us on the east coast, so the Yelp reviews are a little skewed.  I decided to take my s/o at the time to her first Thai experience and it turned out to be a good selection.  

Ambiance:  Reasonably nice Thai decorum.  A lot of idols and such that I'm not a fan of, but you pray over the food and keep it moving.  Clean and good evening lighting.

Food:  We started with the mango wings and they were quite tasty.  Done to perfection.  I like that this restaurant offers a brown rice option.   My s/o got the sweet and sour chicken.  I got the basil chili chicken.  Both were done to perfection with a lot of fresh vegetables.  I was very satisfied and ended up having enough for a to-go box.  

Customer Service:  It was a family run restaurant and they were very friendly and courteous.

In Closing:  I wanted my s/o's first Thai experience to be at a place where I was familiar.  I took a gamble outside of what I was familiar with and it really paid off.  She was satisfied and actually enjoyed the food.  I felt that this Thai was on par with every other restaurant I have experienced thus far, so on a Thai scale, it's as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"So good! Ordered take out twice and mixed it up both times to ensure we try as much as we can from the menu. 

Things we've ordered the summer rolls, tom yum soup, crazy noodles, panang chicken curry, pad thai, and country pad thai. 

LOVE!!"}
{"text":"We always seem to have a good meal here.  Thai dishes are usually spiced just right and the food presentation is top notch. Ingredients taste fresh and flavorful...always love the chicken satay appetizer and the Pad Thai is a standard in our \"rotation\" as well.

My girls love the bubble tea with the little tapioca balls floating about.

Glad we have such a great local spot here in the 'Ville!"}
{"text":"My go to spot for Thai food in Strongsville. The staff is always friendly and the food, impeccable. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome service. Great dessert( sticky rice). If you are in the area do yourself a favor and try this place."}
{"text":"Wow. I'm confused. Reviews had me excited  to try this place. Service is good. It's clean. Artful food presentation. Fresh ingredients. And the worst Thai food I have had. I regretted not getting a pizza at costco prior to coming here. I love Thai food. I make it at home. I have to beg my wife to eat Thai food. So I was so excited to finally go to a top rated restaurant. Had curry dish...watery, tasteless, no heat. Appetizers: golden bag greasy and burned. Summer rolls tasteless. Maybe it was an off day. Chef out sick?  I don't know. I won't be back. I'd go so far as to say a pre packaged Thai dish at the supermarket would be better. Maybe this is good for the area? I don't know."}
{"text":"Some menu items are different from other thai restaurants. Good quality food. Really sweet staff. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Their bubble teas are amazing, especially on a hot summer day! The spring rolls are really good. The sticky rice for dessert is tasty as well!"}
{"text":"My coworkers an I eat here often. It's always packed during lunch during the week.  I haven't been on the weekend but have driven past and see lots of cars in the parking lot.

For appetizer, it's usually the siam rolls.  They are done to perfection except they come with 5 rolls so we are always fighting over the last roll and end up cutting it in half haha.  I always get the cashew nut chicken and it is so tasty. The flavor is great, I have never been disappointed.  My friends say the mango curry is really good as are the crazy noodles."}
{"text":"This restaurant was easy to find and service there was pretty good.  However, the food looks better than the overall taste.  Don't get me wrong, it's a decent place to get Thai food at if you live nearby or want it as a regular place to get your Thai fix; however, it's not worth driving 30 minutes from Akron for.  I've had better Thai food in Cleveland and there's equivalent food in Akron. 

In the end, try it and see if it's worth your drive."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Cleveland.  Must have the country style Pad Thai.  We drove 45 minutes just to eat here for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I am always willing to try on some Thai Food. A friend of mine recommended this little place. The first time I went was with a group of probably 20 women. Several people had been there before and everyone had recommendations on what to have. Some got the Crazy Noodles, which they raved about. I got dumplings and vegetable fried rice. Both were very good. I had taken home the Beef Macadamia for the husband and he said it was very good. The second time I went I had the dumplings again and the Siam Fried Rice. Was not too thrilled with the Siam Fried Rice due to the shrimp and chicken both being on the dry side. I will still go back though!! 

By looking at this place as you drive by you would miss it if you were not looking for it. Well worth the stop though!! If you are going with a large group, remind the servers to create separate checks. 

Decent prices, and very clean inside."}
{"text":"We had a decent visit to Sweet Mango. The service was great! Highly attentive and fairly quick. The food just okay. Nothing really wrong, but compared to some other Cleveland area thai restaurants i think it is abouut middle of the pack which is why i gave three stars."}
{"text":"The Pad Thai was tasty. I was not the biggest fan of the Crazy Noodles. The service is friendly and the food comes out quickly. The music is too soft, you have to whisper."}
{"text":"My husband and I have recently moved to the Cleveland area from New York. We are avid Thai food lovers and couldn't wait to see what the area had to offer. We found Sweet Mango while exploring the area and decided to stop in one evening. 

The service from beginning to end was excellent, which is a great way to start any dining experience! Onto the food...The menu has many of your usual Thai favorites, as well as a few more 'authentic' options. We've tried many of their dishes by now and haven't been disappointed in them at all. 

If you ask, you can tailor the heat level of your food and even what ingredients are used. I very much appreciate that as I am allergic to fish. They've told us that their chefs take pride in cooking everything from scratch in the kitchen, they don't use premade sauces or bagged meals/food-that is how they're able to tailor make everything. Nothing like custom, cooked to order food made by true chefs! The food we have had has always been excellently cooked. 

The decor is nice, with a couple print paintings and some statues here and there. Enough to give it a comfortable atmosphere. I'd say attire is casual, but you wouldn't be out of place in dressy-casual for a date night. 

We are so happy to have found Sweet Mango! We'll be coming back here as often as possible :)

EDIT:
Recently went back to the restaurant and had their Mango bubble tea. Delicious! It comes out slightly frozen, kind of like a slushy. Even my husband, who doesn't like bubble tea, enjoyed it! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"FINALLY! We have found a Thai place in Cleveland that rivals our favorite called Rouen Thai in Tampa. Sweet Mango is located in Strongsville very close to South Park Mall. We have no reason to be in South Park except to try this restaurant, and I can assure you there will be more trips back in the near future. We had a thai iced tea (yummy!), summer rolls & spring rolls (both delicious),  and two generous entrees of Masaman curry and pineapple chicken. Masaman curry came with sliced chicken, a very thick and spicy curry sauce (we ordered it medium, and might kick it up a notch next time), sliced onions, green peppers, red peppers, carrots, & sweet potatoes. The pineapple chicken had sauteed chicken in a sweet pineapple sauce a bit thinner than the curry and served among big chunks of pineapple, red peppers, grape tomatoes, mini mushrooms, mini carrot cobs (whatever those things are called), carrots, zucchini, and squash. they are CERTAINLY not skimping on the vegetables here. You also can have a choice of jasmine rice or brown rice with your meal. The bill rang in under $35 including tax. The service was very prompt and friendly. Our meals were probably the best Thai we have had in Cleveland over the past two years, and we have been searching (haven't tried Ty Fun yet). The location is a bit set back from the street so we almost missed it. The dining room is very simple but well kept and clean. It has stone and hardwood accents, crown moulding, fresh flowers, and lit candles. The menu was quite large with most entrees priced under $10. There is a nice beer and wine list, and they accept credit cards. This place is worth the trip to the burbs!"}
{"text":"This is one of those local spots my wife and I really enjoy. The prices are average and the food is always great. The curries in general are all good and if you dine-in the presentations are quite nice. I am a big fan of the crazy noodles (Pad see ew) which are a must have in my opinion. They have some pretty good desserts and specials. Service has always been very good.

Strongly recommend for anyone in the area looking for Thai food."}
{"text":"The Ginger chicken and Curry are great. Here you specify your Heat range by \"stars\" desired, I usually as for the 2 or 3 star (enough for my heat needs)
The Deserts are great too. I'm usually there for lunch! The Place is set up nice too and Ambiance is great.
I'm trying a Mia Tai next time I get out there later."}
{"text":"Quick service, good choices of spicy or mild. Portion size is very good, not too much. Server did not speak Thai, though."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and it's always been good. This time a fairly sizeable piece of plastic ended up in my husband's dish. They handled it appropriately and removed it from our bill. He said it was still delicious. The service was attentive and we will likely return!"}
{"text":"The country pas Thai is wonderful
 I usually have to add some spice or soy sauce. But they has it down pat."}
{"text":"Pretty good for your run of the mill suburban thai restaurant.  The night we went was incredibly hectic (2 large parties of 10 or more in a medium sized place).  Unfortunately the night kind of started out sour because the host appeared to have forgotten about us and seated several tables ahead of us that came in after us. 

Would recommend checking out Charm Thai in Broadview heights, the food here was not nearly as authentic or flavorful.  They do use quality ingredients, however."}
{"text":"Sweet Mango is a fairly new establishment in Berea. Yay for diversity in restaurants in Berea....finally. 

I enjoyed a very nice lunch with my beau on the patio. The presentation of the dishes was lovely. The food quantity was just right and everything was prepared freshly. 

We enjoyed the mango rolls. They were very mild in flavor, and due to my penchant for snobiness, I'll stick with my Spring Rolls at Minh Ahmn. The curry dishes, however, were to die for. 

When ordering takeout everything was quickly done and excellent again! I loved the \"Green Garden\" dish with steamed veggies. My mother ordered Pad Thai, spice and it was perfect. 

Sweet Mango has excellent service, and everything met my foodie expectations. 

This is a great place to dine if you have a vegan or vegetarian in your life. 

I'm hooked and you should be too!"}
{"text":"As a big fan of Thai food I was pleasantly surprised to come across such a great Thai restaurant in Strongsville, a new favorite spot at that. We tried a combination of appetizers, the potstickers, summer rolls and tofu triangles. All were delicious and perfect for picking & sharing among the table (very reasonably priced as well). The basic Pad Thai lunch was filling and almost tasted sweet, which was perfect as one of us doesn't prefer spicy foods. Ended with the mango sticky rice with a coconut cream on top- fresh & delicious! Highly recommend any of the above, especially with a Thai iced tea. The staff was very friendly, atmosphere is very clean and the food was delicious. Can't wait to go back & try more."}
{"text":"I'm not sure but this isn't as good as a four and half stars as the reviews suggest.  The place is just ok.  I did a to-go order of the yellow curry with rice and the thai iced tea.  The thai iced tea was good but the yellow chicken curry was plain ok."}
{"text":"Service was amazing last time I visited. Food was very fresh and prepared very quickly I will be returning weekly after my phenomenal experience!!!!! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Thai restaurants that I've ever been to. Their country style pad thai, you can choose how spicy you want it and all their fried rice is amazing!  The staff is always very friendly and inviting."}
{"text":"I live on the north side of Chicago where there are 3 to 4 good Thai restaurants in a mile radius of one another. We were in for the holidays, and after passing on the 45 minute wait at the B Spot, decided to have dinner at Sweet Mango. What a treat!

It's located across from the McDonalds in a nondescript strip mall.

We started w/ the Mango Wings ($6.95): Chicken wings seasoned and fried to a crisp and served with homemade mango sauce. OK but nothing special.

We also tried the Thai Iced Coffee Martinis ($7), which were delicious. Highly recommend.

My sister had the Tropical Bird's Nest ($17.95 and only available for Friday & Saturday dinner): Combination of shrimp, scallop, chicken with an assortment of vegetables in a mildly spicy Thai special sauce served with sweet potato as a nest. Wonderful presentation and very delicious! A real standout.

I asked for Pad Si Ew ($9.95): Stir fried rice noodles w/ chicken, garlic, chinese broccoli and soy sauce, which is a menu standard at every Thai restaurant in Chicago, but missing from the Sweet Mango menu. I asked the server if the chef would make it as a special request and, to my delight, he willingly obliged. High marks for this level of customer service. Plentiful, tasty and also nicely presented w/ a carrot-flower garnish. It's a simple dish but very satisfying.

We got my brother takeout Shrimp Himaparn ($12.95): Sautéed shrimp with onions, red peppers, mushrooms, snow peas, scallions, pineapple chunks and cashew nuts in a honey lemon sauce, plus extra shrimp for $3. He's a member of the Clean Plate Club.

We indulged in the Sticky Rice w/ Fresh Mango and the Sticky Rice w/ Ginger Ice Cream. Both were ridiculously delicious. As Filipinos, we both really loved the creamy coconut milk in the warm rice. The ginger ice cream offered the perfect balance w/ an interesting spicy finish. Desserts are listed on a separate menu and are not on the takeout menu. Dessert prices range between $5 and $6. We also got a taro bubble tea smoothie. The tapioca balls were on the gritty side, and not as chewy as I prefer.

The dishes are clearly marked on the menu w/ asterisks for *Mild, **Spicy, or ***Very Spicy heat levels, and the kitchen will also adjust the spiciness upon request. The menu is diverse with traditional Thai soups, salads. noodles & fried rice, stir fries, and curries. Protein options include chicken, beef, pork, fish, shrimp & other seafood, duck, and tofu. They offer several vegetarian-specific entrees. The menu also states that they only cook w/ 100% vegetable oil and low sodium soy sauce, and they never use MSG:) Many of the entrees are offered as lunch specials (Mon-Sat 11:30 AM - 3:00 PM and Sun 12 Noon - 3:00 PM), prices range between $7 and $8. Plus, they offer a choice between jasmine or brown rice. http://www.sweetmangoohio.com/

Service was wonderful. The serving staff is young, but professional. Our server (I think her name was Alicia -- and she's Thai) was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. She offered recommendations upon request. Water was refilled frequently and dishes were cleared promptly after each course. We did not feel rushed. A relaxed, enjoyable meal.

The space is tastefully decorated w/ classic Thai art. Warm, cozy and comfortable. I did not check out the bathroom. 

Overall, Sweet Mango is a terrific restaurant! The prices are a little bit more expensive than what I am used to paying in Chicago. However, the ambiance, the high quality and freshness of the food and presentation, the scrumptious flavors, and the service made our dining experience worth every penny. In my opinion, the best asian restaurant in the southwest suburbs. We have enjoyed Sweet Mango on several occasions, always enjoyable. We will definitely return for more!"}
{"text":"Wow This is one of my favorite Thai places.  Everything here is tasty and authentic.  The only thing I did not see on the menu is Pad See Eww.  Great food Great service.  Can get very busy at times but I would wait an Hour to eat here, it is that good."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Strongsville. Food is always delicious and prices are great. Servers are always friendly and fast! It is a small and quiet place, very peaceful. Never a wait to get in. We go probably once a week and I recommend the crazy noodles! My favorite:) Also, best bubble tea I have ever had. Sweet Mango is such a refreshing change from all the chain restaurants in this area. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and found the food outstanding.  Also worth mentioning was how clean this place was!  
I ordered the Summer Rolls and Seaweed Salad -- outstanding!
I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here seven times by now and every single time the food is SO delicious! The prices are great,  the food is yummy, portions are big too! I usually get some kind of curry dish, he gets the curry or pad thai but we always get the sticky rice with either ice cream or the mango! We get all that food plus beverages and the bill is never over $25.00!! I would recommend this restaurant to everyone and anyone who  loves fresh veggies cooked to perfection, delicious sauces over wonderful food and yummy dessert too!!"}
{"text":"Very nice option for weary travelers trying to avoid standard road food.  Good food, really friendly staff, fast service.  Delicious end to my long drive."}
{"text":"Food is flavorful and great quality. As a mostly-vegetarian type of person of person, I appreciate the number of vegetarian dishes they offer."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. I visit the Strongsville area every 3 months and have to eat here at least twice during the week. Great food and they have the best Thai Basil I have ever had. A must when in town."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go!  The food is amazing!  My husband and I have gone to a handful of different Thai restaurants and nothing compares to Sweet Mango.  We've recommended it to many people and everyone has been extremely pleased! Definitely worth every penny!!"}
{"text":"The wife and I stopped at this quant, corner of the stripmall, restaurant for a late lunch.  I was thankful for their crispy fresh seaweed salad followed by spicy country pad Thai and masaman curry that was silky sweet and spicy with coconut milk and sweet potato.  Overall good meal in a location we don't frequent very often."}
{"text":"Horrible!  Tonight's dinner was the worst yet.  The only thing that you can get for less than $12 are the noodle dishes which are unseasoned, inedible slop.  Out of control brats running around.  Spoiled our entire evening.

We live about a 5 minute walk away but we never have any luck here.  The first time that we came here years ago some drunk spent an hour screaming about his bill.  Tried coming for lunch several times but you don't get more than three spoonfulls of food.  No kidding, take a look at the pictures with a fork or spoon placed on the entrée dish, the utensil is bigger than the serving.

We're just going to give up and go to Larb in Brunswick.  Actual Thai food and lower sales tax."}
{"text":"This is a great local Thai place. It is right next to campus and a great change from China House. It is a classier establishment with more expensive dishes and a better atmosphere for most Asian restaurants. The lunch menu is a great value, around 7 dollars for a full meal and the quality is great. The Spicy Thai Basil is my favorite, the seafood is also a close second. Their desserts are very unique and worth trying. I tried the sticky rice with mango and it did not disappoint! This place is not for everyone, but if you like Thai it is a must!"}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, friendly and tasty . Best Thai food in Strongsville.  Can adjust the level of heat per request."}
{"text":"As always we tried this restaurant based on reviews. The food was good, not outstanding.  The reason for the 2 stars was the service.  The waitress took our order and served the drinks and never came back until the food was ready.  She then again did not come back until we had been done with our meal for 20 minuets.  Never asked if we wanted another drink or more water. Did not ask if the food was good.  The restaurant was not busy either. Disappointed with the service."}
{"text":"We visited this spot after reading the reviews on Yelp. At first we were skeptical because the parking lot was empty and it was next to a fast food restaurant, however, our doubts were cast aside shortly thereafter. The ambiance of this restaurant is quiet and quaint and very conducive for a first date. The wait staff was friendly and efficient. Although there was only one other couple in the restaurant when we were seated the place filled up rather quickly and I could tell that the service would suffer because we only counted three individuals waiting tables. The food was fantastic. Pretty presentation so it made for good food porn to post online. I had the Larb salad and coconut chicken soup, both were tasty. The pineapple chicken was flavorful. This is a good spot and we will visit again."}
{"text":"When looking for the restaurant it's across the street from McDonalds. I missed it the first couple passes. 

The food was very good and I love their Tai bubble tea. The bright orange color would make it seem sugary sweet but it was tastefully sweet and delicious. 

The prices were very reasonable. We had an appetizer two entrees and two specialty drinks all for under $30. 

I would defiantly go again!"}
{"text":"Amazing place! The food is outstanding and perfect place to have lunch or dinner. The staff was very friendly the ambiance pleasant and the food out of this world. 
We had seaweed salad, seafood coconut soup, panang vegetables and masaman vegetables and they even packed my leftovers since we ordered so much food  Thai iced tea was amazing too!"}
{"text":"This is a good solid Thai place. I enjoyed the food, but found the service only so-so. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area, but not necessarily worth a trip across town."}
{"text":"Love this place. Like so many ethnic restaurants, I wish they would update the decor a bit, but at the end of the day this is some really good Thai food in CLE SW. Fresh ingredients, fresh taste, beautiful presentation. If you're in the area and looking for some Thai, then look no further."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here and would love to go back again when I'm in the area. Tremendous value here for the quality of food that I got for lunch. This was a very nice find when we were searching for something different to have for lunch.

The food is great here, lot of flavor and very well prepared. I've eaten at many Thai restaurants and this was one of the better ones that I've been to. They have a great selection and the food comes out fast. I bought a first timer here and the felt the same way that I did. This place is worth try!"}
{"text":"The best Thai food around! Love the pad Thai. It's a nice cozy little spot! Go there next time you're in the mood for a nice quiet meal!"}
{"text":"atmosphere was awesome.  the service couldnt be better.  had the crazy noodles and was more than satisfied."}
{"text":"Before I had ever moved here to Strongsville, me and my Wife would sometimes go with her family to Sweet Mango and it was always a treat. I would find myself dreaming about this place after my first visit, so I knew she was a keeper. 

I am a huge fan of Duck, so let it be known that is usually on my mind when visiting Sweet Mango. It's hard to find a place that does duck right, so when you do find one, treat it as golden. I also have had the pleasure of having their many Curry dishes, Pad Thai, Appetizers, Desserts and I have to say everything has been wonderful. There is never a disappointing moment here at Sweet Mango.

The service is always fast, attentive and very polite. Management will come to greet you with a genuine smile, sometimes blessing you with a free dessert. You can't beat that, people. 

The atmosphere is very tranquil and bright, the music usually always consisting of Asian folk music and warm tones.

I honestly don't have a single bad thing to say about this place, it's all positive with me. So if you are in the area, stop by and grab some crispy duck or one of their many excellent dishes."}
{"text":"My best friend was visiting from LA and craving Thai food, since I just moved to the area I went straight to Yelp for help.

These other reviewers won't steer you wrong.  The food is excellent.  I love spice and enjoyed the perfect amount of fire in the basil beef.  My friend is vegetarian and went crazy over the basic garden salad.  I couldn't believe it.  She wanted a bigger portion, it was that good.

The service was quick and friendly.  The price was just right.  Only critique I'd make was that there wasn't any background music playing.

I will return to Sweet Mango.  I'm excited to try some of these other reviewers' recommendations."}
{"text":"Sweet Sweet Mango.  What a refreshing change you are from the sea of diners in Medina.  You aren't much to look at from the outside, but on the inside you are filled with pretty and delightful things to eat.  Thank you for filling my belly with a perfect tempura, wild boar curry, crispy duck and coconut ice cream.  

I think I have a crush on you."}
{"text":"This place has fallen a bit. The last few visits have been less than stellar. 

The pad thai tastes different now. The flavor is just off, and it comes very runny. Another dish that I get often is their pumpkin curry. This past visit, I'm not sure what happened but whatever they gave me wasn't curry. It was more like a generic veggie stir fry. It couldn't have been a mistaken order, because the dish was still prepared like their pumpkin curry (in a tortilla shell), but the sauce was definitely not curry.

Do they have a new chef or something? Whatever it is, it has turned me off and I don't see myself eating here anymore unfortunately."}
{"text":"My initial visit must have just been a salty day.

I went back! I got tamarind tofu for lunch. REALLY spicy and tasty!!! 

Portion still a bit small compared to other local Thai places."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this only passes for good Thai food to those who haven't really experienced good Thai food. Really, all dishes I tried were just mediocre - will keep searching for good Thai in the Cleveland area. I guess I was spoiled by living in NYC."}
{"text":"The pot stickers were good and the pad Thai was delicious! The only thing was it smells like wet dog and it's super pungent! I would definitely opt for take out next time because of that."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times and was happy with the food and service every time. I recommend crazy noodle, pad thai, and taro bubble tea."}
{"text":"Love this place for curries pad Thai appetizers atmosphere staff presentation.  A real treat. Always go when visiting parents. They love it too!  Ask for specials."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Sweet Mango Curry. The green curry was very tasty. My only complaint is that I asked for extra spicy and the dish was not spicy at all. Prices were relatively low and the portions are large."}
{"text":"Just phenomenal. The flavors of everything are overwhelmingly good. Crazy a Noodles, Pad Tai, Pad Thong, anything shrimp here, all victories. Clean with an excellent and friendly staff. Love this place! One of my favorite Thai places hands down!"}
{"text":"Sweet Mango is by far the best Thai in the Cleveland area. As a college student at Baldwin Wallace University I went to their Berea location weekly. Now that I live on the Eastside the Westside locations are a little harder to get to, but every once and awhile my cravings get so strong I make the trip! 

Their dishes are authentic and everything is cooked to perfection. The veggies in their dishes are super fresh and all their curries are on point. My favorite dish is the Tofu String Bean in red curry. It's full of tofu, beans, peppers and cashews! Yum! 


If you're looking for great Thai in Cleveland. Sweet Mango is it!"}
{"text":"Great dinner. I had the Bird's Nest special because I love sweet potatoes. Surprisingly every ingredient (including the sweet potatoes) is intensified by the specail Thai sauce. All the deserts are simple, but that is just what is needed after the complex flavors of a wonderful thai meal."}
{"text":"Sweet Mango gets it right...I really enjoy the Siam Fried Rice, there is something about it that is on point! My husband enjoys the Pad Thai...both dine in and take out, Sweet Mango doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"The food is good for an Asian restaurant in the burbs.  I've found that you get better Asian food for a better price in the more urban areas of NE Ohio."}
{"text":"This place has pretty terrific and authentic Thai food.  Too bad it's all the way in Strongsville.  

Despite being terribly far away from me, I've been here three times now, and this restaurant has made a consistently good Pad Thai - not too sweet, not too soggy, no weird spices giving it an odd taste - pretty comparable to Pad Thai you might find in Thailand (saying this from experience!).  

What I really like about this place though is the noodle soups.  It's not on the menu on the website, and it's technically offered as a lunch special, though they will make it anytime for you.  You get your choice of protein (I particularly like the duck version), and you get this amazing, authentic-tasting soup.  Quite honestly I'm not sure what spices they put into it - lemon grass?  mint? - but it's pretty awesome.  You need to try it to believe it."}
{"text":"Great Thai food, although we tend to get takeout here instead of eating in due to the weird smell in the restaurant that a few other reviewers mentioned. The food is solid and the portions are fair, although we usually have to order an extra side of rice with the curry as they don't give you much. There is also not much heat even when we request things spicy. But nothing a little Siracha can't fix. Favorites are the pad Thai (country style), Panang and Massaman curries, and the Siam rolls. Stir fry dishes are not bad just not stellar. Only other complaint would be that oftentimes our order isn't ready on time even when we wait the estimated time. But still a great close option and by far the best Thai in the area!"}
{"text":"As usual, this place is amazing. Most of the naysayers you find on here are irrational and probably have the palate of a three month old puppy. 

I recommend the masaman and panang curry. Pad Thai Country Style is also fantastic."}
{"text":"Something about the rice here is just right.... and then there is the Pad Thai: my standard dish for judging a Thai restaurant .  Well, this would likely be one of my personal top 10 Pad Thai plates in the country. Yep

Next time I'm transiting I-80, I'm stopping for lunch or dinner!!!"}
{"text":"Just had an over-the-top wonderful experience. I ordered a fried rice, basil chicken stir fry, and pad thai. I drove 20 minutes each way to pickup the order. 

Unfortunately when I got home I realized there was a miscommunication on the order, and one of the items was wrong. 

When I called to let the staff know, they volunteered to drive the correct item all the way to my house. 

This kind of customer service is hard to find and greatly appreciated. On top of that, all the food was very good. I will definitely be back and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  I'm certainly not convinced it's more than your average Thai restaurant.  The service, menu, decor, ambiance etc were all fine.  The food didn't blow me away or even really make me happy.  I think it was the pot sticker starter that ruined my lunch.  Perhaps if I had been happy with them I would be at 4.  Maybe.  They tasted fishy and off.  I'm not even sure they were supposed to have fish in them.  I'd have to reread the menu.  Either way, I don't think I've left a pot sticker on a plate in my life!!! These were inedible.  Miriam ate a couple and said she didn't like them but then again she wasn't as repulsed as I was having eaten 2 of them.  

The red curry is ok.  I had it with duck.  The spice level is lower than most... fine by me.  The green beans and carrots in the dish were raw.  I'm used to tomatoes and pineapple with my duck but I don't care either way if it's prepared well.  I liked that you could substitute brown rice.  The curry didn't have that layered and complex dimension that I like in good curries.  It was a little thin but I did think it was ok.  Fine."}
{"text":"First time in Cleveland, found this place online. Great restaurant, food is delicious. The workers are kind and good at their job. Our food arrive within 8 minutes of placing our order! Talk about being efficient!! I'm really impressed. If you want authentic Thai food for a decent price, this is most definitely the place to go. It's located right off the interstate 71S and 82. For anybody that's in strongsville, it's good eats. 

We also saw the owner prepping, cutting the veggies by hand. Therefore everything is fresh and on point. Will def be back the next time I'm back in Cleveland! Good day to end the trip with a delicious meal."}
{"text":"SUPER GOOD! Presentation is beautiful and the food is spectacular! Pineapple fried rice is amazing and the honeydew bubble tea is delicious! My bestie hot the strawberry coffee smoothie and loved it! This will be apart of our takeout choices!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible!  Went there last night 6/6, And the food was mediocre at best.  The waitress/bartender looked like she wanted to kill everyone in there, including us, and would just drop our food on the table without a word and a glare.  When it came time to pay, we were owed $12 and some change for a $28 dining bill.  She took the money without a word and walked away.  Ten minutes later, when she still didn't bring our change, we asked another waitress to bring it for us.  Miss personality came back and threw, yes threw, our change down on the table, and walked away without a word.  Needless to say, we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This is the best thai food you will find in Cleveland!!! One caveat, they need a new cashier because they did not understand my simple instructions for an order!"}
{"text":"Excellent food every time I've been there.  I usually get the Crazy Noodles, which are delicious and just the right amount of spicy for my medium tastes.  My good friend usually gets the Ginger noodles (or something similar, can't remember the name) and that is to die for as well.  Price is right, less than $10 for most meals, and the service and atmosphere are above average.  Probably a great place for a date as long as your date isn't too picky on the spicy/adventurous foods.  Everyone keeps talking about the mango rice as dessert, so I'll have to try that the next time I go."}
{"text":"We went here for date night and couldn't have been happier! The service is great the ambiance is quiet and pretty and the food is delicious! I had the pad Thai which was great and he had the crazy noodles.. While he is not a big Thai fan usually, he really enjoyed this meal!!! Also you have to try the sticky rice with coconut ice cream. It is to die for!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants!   The food is always fresh and well prepared - the curry dishes are great - Pik King and Green Curry are my favorites, the way they blend flavors is surely a treat for your tastebuds.  The staff is also attentive and very pleasant"}
{"text":"Loved it.  Great device and well spiced and flavorful food.  Cooked just right, veggies still had crunch."}
{"text":"This one is one of the closest and the best option for Thai  food near my place. I like their chicken satay and pad Thai country style. The service is fast and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Solid Thai place, but honestly I can only speak for the pad Thai. Call me cliche, or but every time I get Thai food  I have to order pad Thai. This pad Thai is top notch in Cleveland!

To go portions are plentiful

Get it 'country style' to kick it up a notch on the spice factor"}
{"text":"I went with my sister (it was her first time eating Thai food) and we sampled from Pad Thai, Pineapple Fried Rice, and Sweet and Sour Chicken (her choice). I didn't try the chicken but she said it tasted okay, but she was clearly expected something more like Chinese Sweet and Sour Chicken. The Pad Thai here is very good and so is the Pineapple Fried Rice. I also got a Thai Iced Tea which I usually like but it was a little too sweet to enjoy. All in all a good place to eat."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!!! I have been to Sweet Mango a number of times and each time I go the food is as good as ever.

I would highly recommend this establishment to those wanting a quick lunch, or a nice dinner.  The menu is priced very good and the food portions are very good. 

Another plus is that the spice levels actually equate to spicy food.  I am a huge fan of spicy eats and am often let down when I get \"spicy\" dishes.  If you tell the wait staff you like the food spicy they will allow you to go above a 5 star spice level.

Only complaint is that the restaurant isn't easily seen from the road and is located next to a Penn Station."}
{"text":"There are a lot of food options in Strongsville but Sweet Mango is hands down the best! The Pad Thai is AMAZING, the food is quick and staff are very friendly; you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Chicken noodle soup?  Yes!  Here it is the bomb. Fresh, spicy (I ordered2) and a huge portion. The broth has a very complex flavor. Potstickers- yes. Chicken satay - meh. A little dry but sauces were great."}
{"text":"Yellow curry was perfect in its taste and spice level but a little smaller in size for an entree. So went for a mango fried rice and that was very Thai like as well! Fyi, you can ask for your curry without fish sauce if you are a vegan (like I did)."}
{"text":"Thai ice tea is too much sugar so less of milk/half & half. Dessert only look nice but taste....ewww"}
{"text":"Great Pad Thai Country Style lots of  sauce and great flavor. The Summer rolls were also a big hit"}
{"text":"Recently opened a second location in downtown Berea which I've been to once and is just as good.  I've frequented the Strongsville location for much longer and have never had anything less than a great experience.  

They also sell their red, green, or yellow curry sauce separately if you're semi-ambitious.  $5 for a container; just add your own veggies/rice/meat and you got yourself a meal.  (After typing all that, it'd probably just be easier to eat there.)

Fantastic job again, sweet mango.

**Forgot to mention originally-they are closed between 3 and 4.  Which is annoying because it was the THIRD restaurant we went to that day closed during those hours before dinner (Trivs & Tomo Sushi as well).  So, we sat in the parking lot til 4:00 on the dot when the nice lady turned the CLOSED sign over to OPEN.  Then I was happy."}
{"text":"Authentic Thai food.  This was a real pleasant surprise for my Wife and I. The drinks were authentic tasting as well as the food. I had crazy noodles which were crazy good. My wife has pad Thai which was seasoned/ spiced just right.  Ty all for your reviews and pics. These all helped us tonight."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants! Love the crazy noodles and curry dishes. Siam rolls are awesome and we always have to get the mango sticky rice for dessert!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food. They use fresh herbs to season their food. Very friendly & fast service. This restaurant is located at pearl rd."}
{"text":"I recently visited the Berea Location, and was impressed.  The previous occupant was a decent Chinese/Vietnamese joint, but Sweet Mango is a welcome improvement.  They renovated the interior and really classed the place up, and on a Friday at lunchtime, it was pretty busy but the service was very good. 

The food is among the better Thai I've had in Cleveland.  The Duck Choo Chee was especially nice in that it was breast meat only (No Bones!) and the Pad Thai was a solid contender as well.  Both dishes were pleasantly spicy (per our request), though I would assume it would be possible to get them hotter or milder if that's your thing.  The Mango Summer rolls were tasty, and the fried banana dessert was phenomenal.  

I visited with a co-worker who was completely unfamiliar with Thai cuisine, and she was thoroughly impressed as well.  Great stuff!"}
{"text":"This place has some grate food. I had the mango fried rice with a little added heat. And it was very delicious. They give good size portions and they, also have a nice variety to choose from, on their menus. This is deathly a place I and my friends will be going back to."}
{"text":"Sweet Mango gets it right every time.  

I always start with the Pad Thai as a baseline in a Thai restaurant, and Sweet Mango did not disappoint. Excellent presentation, very nice decor, friendly staff.  I've tried their green, yellow and red curries also, and they were quite good.  

My go-to dishes:
- Tom Khar Gai soup (creamy base, with citrus tang & chicken) 
- Pad Thai country style (spiced to your liking)
- Mango Sticky Rice for dessert

I've eaten at both locations (I'm closer to the Berea one) and they're both top-notch."}
{"text":"We were on a long road trip and I was craving Thai. Yelp reviews drove me to this place. We ordered Calamari, crazy noodles and Pad Thai. The food was good and the waitress was delightful. It was perfect for an evening and I was tired of drive through food. I have eaten Thai that has been better than this, hence the lower rating. Overall, a delightful dinner"}
{"text":"I thought the restaurant was very pretty, but thats as far as it goes. The Pad-thai was so bland with no flavor whats so ever. The dumpling bag appetizer was so greasy. If you know good thai food, you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Always a pleasant experience! The service is good, and the food is even better! I got the coconut shrimp special and it was fabulous. I have also tried the Crazy Noodles, and they are amazing. The dishes are ornate and flavorful. I highly recommend Sweet Mango!"}
{"text":"Great Thai meal!

We began with the Spring Rolls ~ fresh & light

We enjoyed several entrees ~ 

Crazy Noodles - excellent flavor, wonderful basil influence, perfectly cooked noodle
Fisherman's Treasure - good but too few mussels
Shrimp Himaparn - the honey lemon sauce is fantastic 
Bird of Paradise (special menu item) - presentation = wonderful! the blooming sweet potato is tasty * lovely * the contents were delicious! (photo with details) 

The service was efficient although we hung on the edge of our seats as our server wrestled with the wine bottle cork. She was flawless throughout the rest of the meal. Our water glasses were always full. 

It's a great lasting impression when you go to eat leftovers the next day and they are clearly packed with care. It's a pet peeve of mine when it appears leftovers are carelessly launched into a to-go container. 

Big plus: most dishes are made to order to your desirable degree of spiciness

Oh, my only regret ~ we didn't get around to any curry dish!"}
{"text":"A great place to have in downtown Berea.  The food is really good, and extremely fast!  It isn't huge, but I think it is a good size for such a small town.  It is nice to have a bit of something different in such a small place."}
{"text":"Ordered Pad Thai and potstickers for takeout and it was ready in 15 minutes or less. The food was delicious - especially the Pad Thai. Amazing flavor and a huge portion. The person taking my order was also very courteous and friendly. Will return."}
{"text":"Located in a mini strip on Pearl Road this Thai restaurant offers a homey atmosphere and friendly servers. 

I ordered the Summer Rolls appetizer and was pleased that they were served cut in half which makes sharing them or eating them yourself much easier. A sweet special sauce was served along side the three full (6 halves) stuffed with shrimp, vermicelli, basil leaves, carrots and lettuce. 

For my meal I tried the Crazy Noodles. In addition to Pad Thai there are a couple other noodle dishes on the menu. The Crazy Noodles dish is made with a base of soft, wide rice noodles that are lightly pan-fried with chicken and shrimp, eggs, onions, carrots, broccoli and basil leaves. The broccoli had just the right crunch to it as did the carrots. There was also carrot art on the plate that we saw a staff person sat nearby hand carving. 

All in all a good place for take away or dine in. Pearl Road has so much going on along it, but this place is worth stopping."}
{"text":"They have a different tasting kind of Chai Tea. A good different. Good portions for the price and attention to detail with the different colors on the plate as well as nice bright garnishes including flower shaped orange peel. Very clean place to eat good Thai food."}
{"text":"It wasn't bad and it wasn't awesome BUT I would definitely return if I were in  the area. Nice atmosphere inside. Only two waitresses for the place. Not overly friendly - but that did not bother me. They did their job. We ordered the mango wings and golden bags...golden bags came out first and were not at all hot. But I did enjoy the flavor, loved the sauce that came with it. The wings arrive about 5 mins later, those were tasty. Two orders of country style pad thai. My friend enjoyed hers - I thought it had a creamy consistency that was off putting for me. The left overs actually tasted better the next day. So not perfect on the food, but I would try again and order some other dishes."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing.  The Pad Thai always hits the spot and I can't say enough nice things about it."}
{"text":"I have been to Sweet Mango for many times and ordered pick-ups for many times as well. Almost tried all the stuff on their menu and almost nothing disappoints. I like the crazy noodle, pineapple fried rice (as long as it's not too spicy), basil fried rice, pad thai, pad thai country style, papaya salad, seafood platter (not sure this is how it's called but it has shrimp and scallops in it) and various types of curry. It is also good for late night as it closes very late. Our office usually orders take-outs from Sweet Mango as it's not too expensive but delicious. My only one wish is for it to offer BUBBLE TEA as Strongsville doesn't even have a bubble tea place!"}
{"text":"The food and the service was fantastic. Wife had vegetable fried rice, son had Siam chicken and I had the Tia style basil. I would highly recommend this place, it was busy but the take out was extremely busy."}
{"text":"The pad Thai here is amazing I would recommend this place to everyone looking for a good inexpensive meal"}
{"text":"Sweet Mango is one of my favorite places to grab Thai food. 
They have some great options for curry dishes and they are all good. I love that you can almost always get a table without a wait and the food takes like 0.5 seconds to come out and it's always fresh and delicious. Reasonable prices. Great Strongsville lunch option."}
{"text":"Used to absolutely love this place, especially their combinations of flavors. However, I have noticed their food quality slowly slipping over the past couple of years. Wasn't enough of a slip though until today when I placed a take-out order at 3:20 PM, and was told that the earliest I could pick it up was at 4. Knowing from plenty of experience that 3 in the afternoon is one of the slowest hours for restaurants, and that I only had two entrees ordered that were vegetarian, I found that strange. When I was told at the cashier's counter that I owed about 8 bucks more than I had totaled at home, waited another ten minutes for my \"already finished food\", I mentioned that their online lunch prices do not match. The woman (who has worked there for as long as I can remember) told me that it was because we were now in dinner hour. It didn't hit me until I had already left, that dinner hour started at 4. Hmm, now isn't that a very interesting coincidence? 

You're shady, Sweet Mango.
