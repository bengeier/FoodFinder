{"text":"Hidden gem in Charlotte if you aren't looking for the next big thing. A neighborhood staple since 1947. No matter if you are looking for wholesome breakfast, lunch specials or delicious dinner fare there is plenty to please. Feel good about supporting locally owned businesses. Greystone is a family business and has been since it was founded. You will often find the owner around the bar. I really enjoy the gyro with home made Tzatziki sauce, Grecian tips, or home made wings. Daily drink specials and the kitchen is open until 11pm. Every Sunday game too. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Glad to report, this is still one of the best breakfast spots in Southend.

The pancakes are ENORMOUS you will only need one (trust me). The biscuits have true southern experience behind them --- topped with a bit of gravy... MUAH! So good, so traditional, and prices were very low compared to these self-pegged brunch spots around the area - so many other places overcompensate for these traditional southern recipes to look \"fancy\" just so they can sell you 4 $8 mimosas with your meal. This place have been doing breakfast here for since before I could remember (Charlotte native here). My wife, \"They know how to cook eggs here.\" Her grits were on point too (I tried them myself). 

My wife and I came in here for breakfast. I hadn't been into this family restaurant in about 4 years back we moved to another side of town for a little while.... When I saw the inside was revamped I was nervous the food may have changed with it. Much to our surprise it was the same old delicious breakfast that I remember from 3+ years ago. 

It looks good - more like a bar/hangout spot than a breakfast joint / restaurant. It did not smell like a bar though -- which is important when searching for a hangover breakfast spot. We will prob come back at night sometime to experience the bar feel one day. They have a cool little outdoor area that they're working on now, looking forward to seeing the finished product. Lots of local beers on tap.

Tammy was our server and she was extremely nice. I used to come in here and eat breakfast all the time b/c they knew good breakfast. And as long as the food stays good and priced well -- I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"I first visited Greystone many years ago when it was more like just an Old school diner (actually just found out they have been here almost 70 yrs). I had a good breakfast but just hadn't made it back. A couple years ago I saw they added a nice patio area and and had some beer signs in the window. After a friend let me know it was remodeled and more of a bar now I decided to check it out again. I was not disappointed!! It looks great with reclaimed wood, brick and a great outdoor patio. I am a big chicken wing fan so had to first try them out. They don't have a huge selection of flavors (7 or 8) but they will let you mix them up to create your own flavor. I chose to mix the hot and garlic Parmesan fried  extra extra crispy. They were awesome!! Right up there with Moosehead and Tavern on the tracks. Loved the wings but the best thing About this place is the staff. Always attentive and lots of fun. Please don't come check it out because it is my perfect place to go when I don't want a large crazy crowd and just want to have a great time."}
{"text":"Great food. I had the burger with pimento cheese and potato salad. Good beer selection. Great outdoors area and dogs are allowed. Lots of tvs for sports too. Last but not least great service and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"sought out Greystone for the epic adult capri suns...first time at the Pub.

it was earlier on a Sunday and the place was pretty dead, so i'd like to go back on a busier night, but it was a nice spot. I can tell the crowd is nice and local.

Megan was absolutely the sweetest, and I just wanted to shout out that when a bartender has an empty bar and goes the extra mile to *unprompted* begin to cut open a grapefruit and asks if I was fruit with my vodka soda then you're an A+ in my book. She took time to introduce herself AND invite us back to see her again soon.  You just don't always get genuine hospitality like that anymore and I think it should be commended. When bartenders work an empty bar they are usually grouchy, hate everything (anyways), and just do the bare minimum. Deserves recognition."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and wanted to check out the local bar. Decent craft beer choices but 6$ for a beer at a little bar seems a dollar or 2 high to me. I got a burger and fries and the food was very good. I'm sure I'll be back"}
{"text":"This place is awful. The service is bad,  we waited a while until the server even noticed we were there and it wasn't even busy that day.  They even had the nerve to be rude. NOT only that but the food is bad too. I've never had eggs and bacon that tasted so nasty like old grease. I will definitely never go back. I don't recommend this place to anyone not even my worst enemy.  No one deserves this type of service or quality of food."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. Great service, the salads are wonderful and every time we've ordered been satisfied"}
{"text":"Another great experience at Greystone wednesday, Jude was awesome serving us outside in the nice weather.  Her Capri Stones are a must try!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service every time I have been - they are borderline rude. The food is meh - not awful but definitely not great. It also always seems unclean and unkempt. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent service . Arrived in Charlotte late on a Saturday, met some friends that were already there. Really enjoyed having a quieter place with a neighborhood feel. Was able to catch up and have good conversation with my friends. Bartender was very accommodating to my at times pain-in-the- requests. Enjoyed & will be back if they let me :)"}
{"text":"Several years ago, this place went from being an old school diner to a more modern bar and restaurant. They still have the awesome home cooking and you can get a cocktail. The baked chicken is superb. The only reason they don't get 5 stars is they have a decent amount of turnover so, the service is a little sketchy sometimes."}
{"text":"Just arrived at the bar which has no central Air conditioning in the middle of summer."}
{"text":"Worst bar on South Blvd, menu gets smaller every visit which is why I decided to stop going. Along with them always being either out of the beers in tap or liquor my friends order. No more pool tables so make sure you bring your own entertainment bc they don't pay for bands."}
{"text":"My guy and I have lived down the street from this place for about 6 months now and everytime we hit the BOA atm in front we say were gonna try it. It never looks busy at all and for some reason passed it up for awhile. Today I FINALLY had a day off with him and he mentioned it. At first I thought maybe another day I kinda want..... and couldn't think of anything so said sure lets do it! SO GLAD that we made it finally. We walked in and only about 3 other bar patrons were there it definitely has a regulars only feel to it. Which after our experience there the other day I have every intention of becoming one quick. 

Now onto the food! the menu is rather small but they have some really original sounding things especially in the combinations of things in their recipes and I look forward to coming back soon to try them all. My guy got a gyro plate which has never been my cup o tea but he digs it and said it was outstanding so I take his chef word for it. I on the other hand had the philly cheesesteak and having spent some extensive time in philly although not from there I make it pretty much my sole mission to eat as many as possible from as many places as possible when I am up there so I have been around the philly cheesesteak block so to speak probably more times than I should for a girl my size.  This one was hands down the best one I have had in charlotte. It was outstanding yes I was starving and yes I had a beer or two before I chowed down but lemme tell ya it was scrumptious. The steak was perfectly cooked not dried out the cheese was perfectly portioned out and the bread was super soft which was a little different for me from other cheesesteaks ive had this was more like a brioche hoagie soooo good. 

I was just down right impresses with this place it was clean the music was awesome a lot of blues and classic rock. Theres an outdoor area with cornhole and extra seating and dogs are allowed.  Great drink specials and the bartender was super sweet. Cant wait to come back and definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"On Saturday my girlfriends and I went to Greystone to enjoy their infamous Capri Stones and have lunch.  The food and drinks were EXCELLENT!   

However, the bartender waiting on our table had a poor attitude and was rude from the get-go.  She had a big chip on her shoulder and acted as if we were intruding on her time by being there.  The restaurant was empty except for the 6-8 patrons sitting at the bar watching the World Cup.   It took a long time for the food to arrive, but no biggie.  My friends and I are understanding and forgiving in those situations because we have worked in restaurants and know how crazy and chaotic the kitchen can be.  

Once the food did come out, we asked for drinks and water refills.  We got an eye roll as she walked off.  While she made our drinks, it appeared she was talking about us to the patrons sitting at the bar because we immediately got several stares from some of the patrons.  
 
Her attitude set a bad tone, and we left scratching our heads wondering what the heck happened.  It was an odd experience for sure.  In spite of how we were treated, we took the high road, thanked her when she brought our checks and left a good tip."}
{"text":"Decent wings! We ordered and came to pick it up. The wings were ok but the fries could've been better. Inside looked nice and there were few customers although it was raining. Staff seemed cool but did attempt to make sure we were taken care of. It's worth the try I think we just got them on a bad night."}
{"text":"Finally went here for the first time today, and I was impressed! I had a grilled pimento cheese sandwhich and fries, both of which were fantastic. The fries were handcut and seasoned just the right amount, and the bread was light and fluffy with delicious pimento cheese. Good beer choices and a lot on tap.

I will start coming here to watch some games rather than Icehouse (which is often too crowded and their food sucks)!"}
{"text":"This place will be closed soon.  Absolutely pathetic food.  Burnt gyro meat.  Dog food!  How can you blame the poor girl serving the entire restaurant by herself for the bad service?  Please don't make the mistake we did."}
{"text":"They No Longer Do Breakfast!......or at least that's what the bartender told me when i went there to try their brunch i had heard so much about :("}
{"text":"I just had the most amazing burger!  This place never disappoints.  Megan was super attentive and the experience was perfect.  A hidden gem for sure!  Love supporting local business!"}
{"text":"The worst customer service experience EVER. Let's start at the beginning. Walked in with a coworker for lunch and the place immediately smelled like dirty mop water. A combination of bleach and mustiness.  The air was thick into gross and there were fruit flies everywhere. My view from the table included a newspaper box outside of the window that was covered in trash. The service was incredibly slow despite the fact that there were only two or three other tables seated. After our meal, we had to wait forever to pay. The waitress informed us that their Credit card machine was not working due to a problem with the phone lines. She asked us to pay with cash, we didn't have any. She asked us then to go to the ATM in the parking lot. I could not believe she asked us to do that. Especially since it wasn't even my bank or my coworkers bank and we'd be charged a fee. She agreed to take the drinks off our tab to make up for the fee.Gee thanks.  She also suggested that we just write our credit card information down on a piece of paper so they could manually enter it later in the day. Who in their right mind would ever ask you to leave your credit card information on a piece of paper. After complaining about how inconvenient and off putting the situation was, not to mention that it was making us late getting back to work, the manager finally came out. He literally said \"the phone lines aren't working, not our problem\". And walked back into the kitchen. WTF. I have never been spoken to so rudely by a manager of a restaurant. In my opinion, he should have comped our meals, no question. If nothing else he could've at least apologized for the inconvenience. I will literally never go back to this place and make it's my job that everybody I come across, I tell how awful it was."}
{"text":"The Graystone Philly was delicious! Unique and tasty. Home cut fries made fresh in house.  Good beer selection and great service. 
I understand stand a new menu is coming soon, so stop by and see what they have."}
{"text":"On Saturday, June 23rd I arrived to Greystone Pub with eight of my friends during the hours of 2:42PM - 4:02PM to celebrate our friend - the bride-to-be. This was a spot she was excited to visit and try the Capri Stones. When we arrived we were promptly seated as it was very slow in the restaurant. It appeared there was a private party in the back area and 6-8 guests at the bar watching the World Cup. The first waitress to greet us and take our water / drink order was very nice. Unfortunately, that was the last time we got to see her. Our drinks took long but we were perfectly fine with it. We were relaxing and enjoying our time together. When we got our drinks, they were delicious; however, the bartender immediately displayed an attitude with our first encounter. We were a little perplexed considering our first waitress encounter was so pleasant, and we had just gotten there. None of us complained or displayed any sign of frustration. We were all happy and in good spirit. When the bartender finally came back to the table, we decided to order. The whole time we ordered, she had an attitude in her voice and her actions. She showed frustration having to answer a question one girl had about a menu item. Again, we couldn't understand what we did wrong! So, we continued to keep a positive attitude with each encounter. On two occasions, one of our girls facing the bar witnessed the bartender calling us \"B**ches\" to other guests (at which they would turn to look at us). At one point, the bartender took my water glass from the table and never brought it back. When I requested water with my food, she scoffed and rolled her eyes. She rolled her eyes multiple times through our time there. When we were trying to pay, we asked if it would help her for us to pay at the bar. She answered, \"Not at this point!\" with an attitude. 

I have worked in the restaurant / service industry for 20+ years as a hostess, bartender, server, and a cook so I always treat my servers with respect and kindness. The other girls with me are also in the service industry so we understand why it can sometimes take longer than expected for food and drinks, but the way we were treated was unmerited. We did tip the bartender. The food was good but not enough to make me want to go back for that sort of service!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar. Simple fresh menu and great priced drinks. I really enjoy the gyro and the draft list is surprising well curated. The staff is appropriately friendly. This is just a great place to hang out. I live in the neighborhood and this bar is an excellent alternative to the brewery scene which can get old."}
{"text":"Solid spot in terms of grub, beverages, and ambiance. The service is also spot on, and the pub has plenty of TVs for game-day. The place is a Bills/Bengals bar, so be forewarned if you don't root for those teams and want a prime spot to watch your game during the same time. The prices are great, and the beers on tap are a good selection of local and regional varieties. The outdoor area is underutilized, but great. Definitely our new local sports bar."}
