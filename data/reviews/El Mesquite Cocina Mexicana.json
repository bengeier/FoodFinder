{"text":"I used to LOVE eating here and ordering take-out. Today, I called to order breakfast for take-out for my family. The person that answered hung up on me so I wasn't sure if she took my order. I called back and the person that answered, told me to call back later. Sadly, the customer service has declined. When we stop in to eat, there are always open tables, but not enough servers. The prices keep increasing. Honestly, the food is what makes this place great. If we can't even get that, why be open?"}
{"text":"Their carne asada burritos are great. All in all everything I've gotten from here was ballin."}
{"text":"Good food. The fried tacos are delish as well as the rice and beans. The service is not the best"}
{"text":"Came from out of town looking for a Mexican restaurant. Great place if you like authentic. Loved it!"}
{"text":"One day I'll make it there for something besides breakfast, but I don't know why to bother when the breakfast is so good. They do stop breakfast at 10:30am though."}
{"text":"Really  good food me and my family loves this place the menudo is good red or white my wife's grandmother use to come here for years and traditionally we are keeping this going from generation to generation . get their Earlie for breakfast especially on a Sunday because it does get packed thanks mesquite...."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food. I tried the carne asada and it was well cooked with great flavored. I loved the hand made flour tortillas. Guacamole was a little plain but other than that it was a great meal.  You can tell they take great pride in their restaurant as the food was prepared well. Everything was fresh. I also enjoyed that they put up Christmas decorations during the holidays!"}
{"text":"The food is hot and good. If I was just rating the food I would give it five stars. But the service was slow and unresponsive. In fact the girl bussing helped us more  than our waitress. They adjusted our meal without complaint as I have food allergies. Portion size is perfect, you leave full but not busting. I would recommend this place for great Mexican food."}
{"text":"First time here and it will definitely be my last.  Service was terrible, food was bland which was surprising because the salsa was so hot you couldn't eat it.  Only one coors light in the resturant and it was warm.  Nothing good to say about this place. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm still a fan of this place and stand by what I wrote before hand, but I would like to add is the fact that they have AMAZING chili relleno! I went there recently and had a new revelation, it was slightly soggy but still great. I hope you go and really try it out! it's worth the trip to the southside! :)"}
{"text":"I called in to make an order and after the lady took my order she was very rude she told me \"when you get here you're going to have to wait 10 minutes\"  I asked her \"why do I have to wait that's why I'm calling in my order\" and she said \"well it's because people call in orders and they don't show up.\"  I said \"I'm on my way now\" she said \"well you're still gonna have to wait.\"  So from this point on they will never get my business again she was very rude and disrespectful they will not get a penny from me ever!"}
{"text":"I had a machaca taco with chili relleno, rice and beans. It was very good. The salsa is nice and hot just how I like it. Overall I would be back to this little hole in the wall."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our lunch. Its a small out of the way place but worth it.  Real authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Probably the best Mexican food on the south side !!!! I've been going there for 10+ years !!!"}
{"text":"Decent food but was totally dead inside at 6pm on a Thursday.  Cant really think of anything they offer that I cant get elsewhere in South Phoenix.  Had some chips and salsa and a green chile pork burrito.  Good homemade flavor to it."}
{"text":"The seasoning on the chips and the salsa they give you when you first sit down are some of the best I've had in a while! Worth coming just to try those.  All in all, an authentic menu and solid meal. Apparently goat is one of their specialties, but I didn't have the guts to try it for breakfast."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 carne asada burritos and 1 carnita burrito, drove 4 miles (8-10 minutes) and attempted to eat one. It had brown slimy lettuce in it, I opened the rest and pulled out all of the lettuce in them too as they had the same issue. I rebuilt the burrito and proceeded to eat, unfortunately they had zero flavor and taste was so grissly. The carnitas had zero flavor, added all of the salsa they put on the side and only ate a couple of bites, the rest of the gang did not even bother to eat all of their burritos. It was so bad that grown adults after a long day of catering threw out uneaten food. No one said anything they just pitched them in the garbage. When asked each one just said they were horrible burritos."}
{"text":"One of my fathers favorite places to have breakfast.  El Mesquite is a bit of a drive and in the hood but anytime my dad asks if I want to join him I always say yes.  The food is done well.  The Mexican standards: beans, rice, chips and salsa are all tasty.  I've had several items over the years from chile verde to chorizo.  We really only go for breakfast so I can comment on the other items.  But nothing I've ever ordered has been off the mark.  The stand out for me are the tortillas and especially the horchata.  It has to be the best non homemade horchata I've ever tasted.  Executed perfectly.  I would definitely go here more often and for more meals if it werent so far from home."}
{"text":"El Mesquite is an outstanding neighborhood spot where tradition meets plate- and the customers are the big winners. As others have mentioned, this is a neighborhood place, where everyone knows each other, and the servers work here forever.  If you need corporate clutter, fake ambiance, licence plates on the wall, etc. this is not a place for you. If you like authentic food, warm service and spicy tasty salsa, then grab a table, and tell your taste buds to buckle up.  I first went to El Mesquite years ago when I worked downtown. I fell head over heals for their unique chips and addictive spicy salsa. Warning, it is hot, but it's not hot just to be hot, like other places (cough cough, Los Dos...).  Being that this is a Mexican restaurant, beloved by locals- you will hear Spanish, laughter, English, and sometimes a combo of  the three. I really do love El Mesquite, they put up with my crap Spanish, and you do not need to speak Spanish to be comfy at El Mesquite.   As others have said, when you arrive, you seat yourself, drinks, chips & salsa will be right behind you. Food is great here, and the price point is very good for the value and amount of food you get. I highly recommend the carne asada burro. I know right now America's Taco shop is reigning supreme, but if El Mesquite was near America's, there would be an epic battle because El Mesquite easily beats their carne asada. No bull!$%@.  Also amazing is their guacamole, unlike many places, El Mesquite doesn't put a bunch of filler ingredients to make the guac go farther. Jus tasty ingredients, and your mouth will be happy. I also want to recommend getting a quesadilla, they are really tasty and cooked to perfection.  Enjoy your trip to El Mesquite, you will not be disappointed, and if you are like me, this place will be in your rotation for 'go to' places!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Never disappoints, everything always taste fresh and delicious. I had the menudo and my boyfriend had the huevos rancheros while our son had the carne Asada plates  The chips and salsa are awesome, just great food"}
{"text":"We are here regularly and have never had a bad meal. The coctel de camaron is a great start. Some of the best horchata. And a green chile is worth the trip from anywhere you might be coming from. Breakfast , lunch or dinner, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"All the food is great. Best Mexican food. Everything is freshly made. Guacamole and chorizo are the best. People are very friendly too."}
{"text":"i feel like when looking for restaurants on here, if i see a three star place i'm likely to avoid it. i had a very good experience here though.  a friend and i were actually looking for a different mexican restaurant, one she tried to go to on a sunday and monday, the only two days they are closed, and when we arrived on saturday evening, we found a sign saying they have moved from phoenix to mesa.  clearly not destined to patronize that restaurant.    anyway, we'd passed the sign for this tiny strip mall restaurant and decided to head back and give an unknown place a try. the atmosphere is pretty generic, there are both booths and tables and some typical mexican decoration. doesn't transport me to a mexican pueblo, but it's not a tourist trap either so i was pretty comfortable.  after a quick scan of the menu my friend decided on the green chili burrito smothered with cheese and plated with beans and rice. ($6.75) i went for the chiles rellenos with rice and beans. ($9.25)  we ate some average tortilla chips with some super spicy red chili salsa and though our meals were out in record time we got a free refill of the chips when we drained the first bowl.   my chiles rellenos were excellent.  dark green chiles lightly breaded, filled to the brim with white cheese and smothered in a spicy green sauce with some extra cheese on top. rice tasted like it had been cooked in beef broth and the beans were definitely cooked with a ham bone.  i'm a vegetarian so i had to skip those but there were two big chiles and i got hot fluffy corn tortillas so i didn't need the sides anyway. (but $9.25 is a little steep for what i was able to eat)   Kate started to dig into her plated burrito when she realized that it was not a 'green chile burrito' but a pork burrito with green chile sauce.  she's not a vegetarian, and is literally the calmest and nicest person i've ever met, but she was pissed. she didn't send it back under the pretenses of false advertising, which she probably should have, but she was really annoyed and even as we were leaving she commented that she would never go back to a place that doesn't label their menu items correctly.   so on the one hand i would go back there in a heartbeat, quick service, good food and for the most part decent prices, kate would list it on a top ten places to avoid list. i would say if you're on baseline and you want something that doesn't pander to gringo's head over to el mesquite and give it a try."}
{"text":"Food was good very tasty, but service was totally crappy. Waitress served me the wrong beverage and took off before I could tell her and then didn't return for another 15 minutes later to take my food order. Then I waited another 30 minutes to get my food served the waitress never asked me if I needed anything else. This was after the lunch rush was gone."}
{"text":"Disappointing big time. Got a to go order, got home and discovered the bean tostadas and enchiladas were literally ICE COLD.  The burrito, rice, and beans were nice and warm as you would expect. We wanted to try this place again but now with this experience, we probably won't go back. Too bad too since they do have good good and great salsa. not gonna waste my money not knowing if I'm going to get hot food or not though."}
{"text":"Mediocre service but the food is pretty good. I like their menudo and posole and it's a pretty good price-$7! However, Their micheladas are really expensive."}
{"text":"Seemed like a cute place, and it was busy so we had high hopes. We ordered the Carne asada burritos and drinks. Refills cost $1, but the cups were large so no big deal. The tortillas were dry and split right away. Whoever rolled the burritos just literally folded them up and threw them on a plate. The scant amount of meat in the burrito had no flavor and was full of gristle.   Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"5 stars for this old favorite..  This place is one of the few places that will serve me menudo the way I like it and on a MONDAY!  I love menudo but just the corn so I ask for just corn. Most places just serve me whatever they serve which I hate. BUT this place did actually try to remove all of the meat from my bowl! I was extremely happy!   They serve homemade tortillas just like my aunt makes which I love!  The waitress was very attentive and the food good. I will be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Yum!  Cute little restaurant with yummy food.  Waitress doesn't really speak English but that was so unimportant.  The service was good and the food was really good.  Great free chips and salsa.  My kids liked the cheese enchilada so much that I didn't even get a bite!  Great bean and cheese burrito.  The best chili relleno I have had in a long time.  The price was a tiny bit more than I was expecting but I will be back!"}
{"text":"The pice of the food was great! The food tastes great. There is a great selection of food. The drinks are wonderful. The servers are a little slower."}
{"text":"They tolerate my demands to put beans and rice and sour cream and lettuce inside a carne asada burrito.    And their salsa is savory, garlicky and spicy.   I dig it.    PUT IT IN YOUR FACE!    They're a few more bucks than a Filiberto's,  but they take your order at the table and the food is served on a plate,   good quality ingredients and plenty of it.      And you can walk around the dollar store (next door) afterward while in a food coma!"}
{"text":"The pozole was amazing and had great flavor! The salsa and chips were good as well! It was kinda spicy and had a good kick to it but still addictive. The homemade tortillas were still hot when i got back to work! Great service i will definitely be back for more! Co worker got a green chili burro and it was heaven in his mouth!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town. The Machaca is all the rage, but you can't go wrong with anything.  Come on a Saturday and Sunday and you'll see the locals enjoying - that's how you know it's outstanding."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. It's also quite unique -- you'll have everything you'd expect to see from a Mexican food place but El Mesquite's take on the recipe is original. For example, the Machaca burrito comes with shredded beef, fried egg, onions and jalapenos all mixed together, instead of just stringy beef like everywhere else. The red sauce had an intense garlic aroma. The chips come dashed with spices. I take the refried beans home with me to make burritos at home!"}
{"text":"Been here numerous times and they have the BEST chicken tacos in town! Love the chips and salsa as well...it's nice and spicy as it should be."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant in a so-so shopping center. I live in Las Vegas, but travel to Phoenix every other week. I eat here every chance I get, and always order the same thing - smothered green chili burrito with rice. It's made with pork - more New Mexican than Sonoran, and it's absolutely fantastic. Plus their salsa has a nice fiery flavor that is highly addictive. Love this place! I just wish they'd open a place in Vegas."}
{"text":"great chips, and flavorful spicy salsa! All the staff are friendly, even if you don't speak Spanish"}
{"text":"Food is home made and really good. Took my sister for the first time on 10/27/17, she did not know it existed and was pleasantly surprised by the establishment. We felt right at home, food was really really good! ( ALWAYS IS!) and price was right! THIS IS OUT SOUTH PHOENIX FAVORITE!!! And we will continue to go as often as possible!!"}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican near where I live = clutch.  I've had the carne asada, the chips and salsa & their breakfast burritos.  All of which I recommend and will be getting again.  The service is great and the ambiance is what you want out of a Mexican restaurant.  Best time to hit this place up due to my schedule is the weekend, which I'll be doing as long as I live near South Mountain!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall Mexican restaurant, awesome. Met a few friends here and we had a great time. I had the sopas with beef after seeing someone else order them. They were great after a healthy dose of salt, although for the price I would have expected them to come with rice and beans. The margarita had a very citrus-y flavor to it, tasty and a bit outside the norm. Our friend said that the menudo was average but I didn't try that so I can't say for sure. Service was fast and friendly even with a steady flow of people in and out. Would definitely come here again when we're in the area."}
{"text":"it's hard to find mexican restaurants that are not greasy.  well, we found that at el mesquite.  there chips are great and they keep bringing them out.  the salsa is more chili powder and hotter than average.  the food is great.  i have not had a bad meal yet.  the prices are reasonable and the service is great.  my only beef is they charge for soda refills!!!  that sucks.  the location is in the very corner of a strip mall and kinda hard to find if you are going for the first time."}
{"text":"Comida buena! I'll admit, I've limited my options to their Machaca and Egg breakfast with their fantastic beans on the side and one of their yummy, homemade flour tortillas. It's hard to veer to another dish when you've found perfection. Yesterday was about my 5th or 6th time eating there and I realized that I just noticed that they don't put cheese on their beans. Normally, I'm the type of girl who asks for extra cheese on the beans but to not even really notice at this place means the beans are fantastic without the added gooeyness of queso. And I love queso! Their red-chili Menudo is quite yummy, as well. It's hard to find good Menudo in restaurants but this one tastes homemade. Yummy, authentic Mexican food is what you get here!"}
{"text":"Ok great Mom and Pop place. This is one of those places that you are glad to find on Yelp because they is only one of these. As far as Mexican food place this is a great find. A little of that sonoran style cooking witgh a little authentic north Mexico flavor. I always go by the beans. The beans reminded me of the beans my mom makes at home. They were made today and not out of a can. And the chips and salsa are good. The salsa has a bite to it so if your are mild salsa person, beware.I recomend this place"}
{"text":"Best Beans and Hand-made Tortillas in Phoenix! I think the best way to judge a Mexican restaurant is by their beans. Even if they have the best salsa or the crispiest taco, if there beans taste like the inside of a can or like they have been re-fried one to many times, I NEVER return. The art of the bean is creamy, soft, silky, and well.....dreamy. The beans, the regular old beans that come on the side of their chili flecked machaca beef or the the eggs ala mexicana are the best I have ever had! The tortillas are freshly hand-made and are to die for. I wont even get started on the garlicky salsa, but I highly recommend a bowl of creamy beans with 2 flour tortillas."}
{"text":"I would give no stars if it let me. Absolutely horrible service. Food took so long we ended up having to get it to go."}
{"text":"Everything here is very flavorful and tasty. Meats are smokey and tender. I recommend to anyone wanting authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Not wanting to drive all the way to Dick's for Sunday breakfast I decided to Yelp places close to my house I came upon El Mesquite, and decided to give it a try. It is located in a strip mall and I would have never heard of it if it wasn't for Yelp. I was pleasantly surprised by the food and the staff. As soon as I walked in I knew it was going to be good because the place was packed. I found the only table available and took a gander at the menu. The chips were crisp and the spicy salsa was delicious. I ordered a quesadilla and the steak ranchero. the steak was cooked in peppers and onions and came with a mildly spicy sauce. My meal was pretty delicious and so was the $3.25 Negro Modello. I looked around at the entrees that sat in from of the people around me and everything looked good and the portions were huge. The food overall was a little greasy, but it was definitely some home cooked mexican (which I could eat every day of my life). I'll have to keep this one on the radar for cheap and good south side fare."}
{"text":"I can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review of El Mesquite. It's one of those neighborhood standbys that you love having around. We've eaten takeout several times and been thrilled with the carne asada, carnitas, and more. And while we've tried it several times already, I'll add that it could easily have been twice as many or more. But their hours are a frequent source of frustration. How does a restaurant surrounded by a mostly residential area close every night at 7:00 and have otherwise seemingly arbitrary hours? Given that it's family-owned, I give them a pass and will return again. Just make sure you call ahead if coming from a distance."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican Food, good service and it feels like home. The chile verde is my staple plate."}
{"text":"Immaculately kept clean. Very friendly ladies greet you with a warm welcome. Food is delicious and plentiful. Flavors are strong, robust, tantalizing, and complex. Grab a napkin for your runny nose! Start off with a salted-rim Margarita, or one of a nice, smooth, cool Dos Equis beer to wash down the chili powder-sprinkled chips and powerful salsa. I always order the #1 which consists of a taco, and a bean and chorizo covered tortilla, cheese enchilada smothered in sauce, and a chunky beef and green chili burrito. It's way more than enough to eat, and I always wind up with leftovers. Very comfortable and inviting dining room, with soft Mexican music playing. Wonderful people and place to take visiting family from out-of-state for an truly authentic taste of Mexico. Prices are fair. Service is excellent and quick for made-to-order homemade dishes. I eat here at least twice a month. If you want to know where to get good Mexican food, eat where the Mexicans do! Love it!! Can't get enough of it."}
{"text":"Service is waaaaay to slow and there is no drink refills. I dont think I will be coming back"}
{"text":"Today was my first time at Mesquite, chips and salsa were served seconds after sitting as well as drinks, menu had a variety of combos, service was good, and food was excellent."}
{"text":"I am totally puzzled by some of the bad reviews. The food is fantastic. Some of the best in this valley. I am from Tucson and in my opinion proper Sonoran Mexican food can be a challenge. Everything I have tried so far has been exceptionally good. The green chili is the best around. Chile rellenos have a nice thin batter, not one of those chile relleno omelets so many places serve. Enchilada sauce is really yummy with a nice bit oh heat and it's not just that pureed red chili sauce. In short my wife is not a huge Mexican food fan, so when she suggests having Mexican and cleans her plate every time I know I am right when I say it's really good.   The only negative I can come up with is the short hours."}
{"text":"Awesome service and fantastic food, the wait staff are friendly and accommodating. They food is ways good when I come in."}
{"text":"Green. Chili. It's all about the green chili here! This restaurant definitely serves more like 'arizona' Mexican food, but most of the customers were speaking Spanish, so that's always a good sign. Their salsa they bring out first is super spicy, and I like spicy. The green chili burro was large and delicious. The husband got enchiladas.... They were.... OK. The prices were super reasonable (less than 20$ for the two of us). Anyway, this place is worth a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend, but we were not impressed. The enchilada sauce tasted like tomato sauce without flavor. The meat in the taco wasn't very flavorful either. The beans were watery and a strange light tan color. Rice was terrible. Chips had some strange seasoning and were a little stale. Won't go back. Service was very good!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, eaten here twice as I was looking for some good carne asada.  The two times I have been here I've enjoyed my food.  I will certainly be back and try some other dishes like chile verde which looks yummy!"}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time eating here. It's a nice small very clean restaurant. The booths were very comfortable. And the waitress was very friendly. Our food arrived in a timely manner. I ordered the taco chicken salad and it looked incredible! But on my second bite I bit down hard on a large piece of chicken bone and cracked my tooth. I showed the waitress the bone that was in the salad and she seemed very apologetic and genuinely concerned. They even gave me a $6 dollar discount off our bill. But I know the dentist bill is going to cost me a pretty penny all because somebody cut corners in their kitchen"}
{"text":"After updating my driver's license photo on a Friday morning (because that's how I spice up my vacation week), I wanted to eat somewhere outside of my general dining zone. By chance, I happened upon El Mesquite and was pleased with my breakfast. My server brought out chips and salsa; man, their salsa kicks ass! Great flavor and fantastic heat. That held me over while I was waiting on the chilaquiles. As others have stated, the beans are on the runny side. But mixing them with rice fixes that.  The staff here was super nice, too. And for the prices, I'll definately be back when i find myself on the south side."}
{"text":"I have been going the El Mesquite sine I moved here 27 years ago.  The food is always good and the waitresses are nice.  It's my go to spot for a Carne aside burrito!"}
