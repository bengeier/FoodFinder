{"text":"Everything was delicious and authentic. Try a bastilla. The service is prompt and warm from the owner."}
{"text":"Great food,  excellent service. The couscous was made just right... So light and fluffy and the beef was so perfectly tender it fell apart with a fork.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"What a gem. Amazing lamb tagine. Abdul catered (cooked and delivered) for an event- we had so much food and not one complaint. Even the kids adored the meat, adults were so impressed. He really went above and beyond to make sure we were well taken care of. 
This is a small (SMALL) place and I have eaten lunch here multiple times. I always get the lamb because nothing could be as good as that. Not fancy- just enjoy the food- every time it is a little different; he makes his own hummus- always changes- and the soup may change but it is good!!! Your meal comes with first course of whatever he has cooked up that day, Moroccan tea, and a really nice serving of couscous and your main course- it can be shared but you will want to take some home, so don't share! 
Thank you Abdul, I try to send all my friends to experience your kitchen! I try to take some home but my husband always finishes it before I can get a second course out of it!"}
{"text":"This could get to five stars once I have a go at the b'stillah, which the limited menu suggests is only available on Saturdays. Fair enough. The chicken tagine and lamb kebabs the other evening were perfect and honored guest/brother in from out of town with the sophisticated palate was pretty amazed Phoenix had excellent Moroccan on offer. Abdul, the proprietor, is a fun conversationalist and was happy to play DJ for us and honor our requests for Algerian rai, gnawa and Moroccan trad. Enjoyed the intimacy, simplicity and furnishings. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Food is average, but I felt its overpriced (for the quantity, service and ambiance). Would not repeat."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place. I discovered it before it opened and met the owner (the lovely Abdul) and told him I would be back, and I meant it! I took 3 friends here during lunch time on a Saturday and it was absolutely wonderful. Abdul is a great host, bringing out various courses to share between us all. I wish I knew what they all were! The veggie salad/dip with the pita bread was delicious, along with olives in oil. We decided to order the lamb couscous and the bastilla (my FAVORITE!) and even though I don't like lamb, I found the couscous delicious. The sauce was phenomenal and the veggies were cooked to perfection. And the bastilla!!! I want to eat this every day. He then served us these delicious smoothies and cookies for dessert. Literally everything I tasted was yummy. Not only that, but it came to about $10 per person. Well worth it in my opinion! 

We plan to go back here very soon and I can't wait!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food that taste like my homemade grandma's food! The service is the best. The tea smell and taste like flower! Amazing experience!!!"}
{"text":"The food was Amazing! We had the lamb kebob. The flat bread was fresh and the humus out of this world!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, especially because it's so hard to find healthy tastey vegan food. The service is the best part, you can always tell the owner loves what he does and makes your food with lots of love. A favorite of mine when in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The place had the look and feel of a family-owned eatery in Fez!  The hot tea was great to start, the pea soup was tasty with a slight kick, and the chicken tajine was good and plenty!  Excellent service.  I would object to the name \"Express\", because, although the food was timely, the owner was in no rush for us to turn over the table-  We ended up losing track of time and was late for my next appointment!"}
{"text":"One of those hole in the wall type of places with phenomenal food and great customer service! I had never had moroccan food and this place definitely was a great place for my first time.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Best hospitality in central Phoenix. Great food. Light fluffy coucous. Started with olives,  carrot and homemade pita appetizer. Spices just right, not over powering like most Moroccan restaurants. Fluffiest pitas ever. Hot mint tea. I had the vegetable couscous (today was potato, changes daily), wife had the lamb couscous. Both were delicious. Finished with baklava (a kind I've never seen before, made a great meal fantastic) and date shake, so good I'd make  a twenty mile detour to eat here. Small building so get there early or on a slow lunch day. My wife had another kind of pastry, which was so good she are it all, very unusual for her. Our host was Abdul. Very gracious, all the while giving fast friendly service, I recommend everyone try this place."}
{"text":"Great Moroccan cuisine the lamb was excellent And the owner very hospitable . Definitely will come back if ever in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Come here for great service, a giant meal and a vibe like you are in another country! The date shake was unreal amazing and for my first experience with Moroccan food, I can say I'm impressed."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I ordered the lamb tagine and my friend ordered the chicken kabob. Everything was cooked to perfection with a lot flavor! Also, the owner is friendly and has a very good energy about him!"}
{"text":"We went with a group of friends last night and had an amazing experience.  Abdul was the perfect host and spoiled us with house-made hummus and pita bread, carrot salad, peas soup, delicious chicken and lamb kebabs, the lightest, fluffiest couscous I've ever had, chicken Bastilla, and, of course, date shakes, It was all extremely good and Abdul treated us as if we were guests in his home. You must try this restaurant for a truly unique and delicious experience!"}
{"text":"Wow, another hidden gem on McDowell.  You really need to do yourself a favor and check this place out.  The hummus was amazing, spicy hot and addicting!  The owner is awesome so proud of his menu and should be and sharing recommendations on what to try.  As always I appreciate the vegan options, will be back again!"}
{"text":"The spicy hummus, sweetened tea, and vegetarian stew were delicious. The cous cous was perfectly cooked, which is a welcome change from every other Moroccan place I've been to.  Abdul's hospitality was refreshing and natural; he is truly a gem of a person.

I have never written an online review before, but the delicious food and warm atmosphere of Cous Cous Express deserve to be recognized."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is really tasty, and it  feels really comfortable. The service is top notch. 
I have felt pretty disillusioned at how generic, sterile, and hollow a lot of the new restaurants popping up feel. This place gives me hope for the future of Phoenix! Amazing food and an atmosphere that feels sincere!"}
{"text":"Very easy 5 star rating! The food was fantastic and the owner took time to explain all of the food and spices and was even kind enough to share a couple recipes as he realized that I have a passion for good food. I had never met this man and left feeling like we had been friends for years. We started with a mint green tea that was unbelievable. Considering that I am not a fan of tea, I was shocked. Next was a split pea soup with loads of flavors. Main dish was a chicken stew that was the best stew I have ever tasted. Will return and highly suggest this place for Moroccan authentic food. Loved it!"}
{"text":"The stew is good and simple but everything else that comes with it makes it amazing. The owners are great people, a pefect mix of being well taken care of and not overbearing."}
{"text":"The service was everything! Best restaurant I have been to in years! The owe er is so personable and he makes everything from scratch. The foodnetwork needs to come here to film. I'm just blown away by how great the food was, and the service."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!  Great service.   Definitely will come back and recommend to others. Try the lamb tajine!"}
{"text":"Wow! What an amazing experience. Abdul, the owner and chef, welcomed us with a smile - - and the best humus I've ever had! The meal only improved from there. Excellent, friendly service; delicious food; and an adventurous atmosphere. 

Be aware that this is not Applebee's - - if you've never had Moroccan before, then be ready for a new experience. But regardless, give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"I just popped in to see what Couscous Express has to offer and I was extremely pleased and surprised with the interior of the restaurant. I half expected the place to be a supermarket inside, but it is a nice, very Moroccan feeling dining room.
Abdul-who I assume is the owner-was very friendly and when I came in the cook brought me a piece of bread and a creamy, spicy hummus along with a great mint tea.
I ordered a lamb tagine to take home because I was busy and I was served a generous portion of very fluffy couscous along with slow-roasted lamb along side potatoes, dates, apricots and peas. It was a very nice experience and I will definitely walk over again soon."}
{"text":"Tea was okay
Hummus was good 
Main dish (lamb) was significantly small in portion. I felt it was way overly priced for a lunch menu.

Reply I got from the greatest couscous maker in the USA. He better invest time in making the food better rather than involving in personal tirades Changing my review to one star:


\"Yes lamb can be very small. Due to coat $9.99 a pound for fresh that I was . 
 Tea was ok. Yes . I never knew of a tea that was woooo. 
      Humus was ok .  but what os not ok. Is the price 
  If you can show me where to had a home made tea . humus. Fresh bread . and the greatest couscous in the USA . plz show me where. I will be happy to enrolls on the program . 
    And please please . stay away . am not a buffet . and prices are well written . you could have a buritto next door for 3.99
     all portions weight 2 pounds . if that small. I suggest start loosing some weight . along with your gorilla wife\""}
{"text":"This place was FANTASTIC!! Abdul was very friendly, talkative and welcoming! we started off with this hot tea, tasted like chamomile and cinnamon, (not sure) It was so tasty!! He brought us a chicken and lamb dish that was so delicious and the hummus was extremely good, definitely my new favorite local spot!"}
{"text":"This place was an amazing treat. We used Yelp to look for Moroccan food and found this gem. We arrived late afternoon. Immediately we're served both delicious mint tea and soup. The soup was very good. We then ordered lamb couscous and pastilla. Everything was delicious. We absolutely loved our food. The owner was super gracious and carrying. He took care of us like his family.
I highly recommend this place. 
Ps park in the back."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal second time here both visits were 5 star experiences great food and service. Genuine hidden gem"}
{"text":"What an awesome find! I love this place so much! Such good food and the nicest service you can ask for! I can't wait to come back again! You really feel like you are part of the family when you come here. This lovely restaurant is not close to my house at all but I'm willing to drive the 45 mins!!! It's a must try in Phoenix  thank you for the wonderful dinner I can't wait to return!!"}
{"text":"One of the best Moroccan restaurants that I have been too. The service was fabulous and the selection was impressive- a must try!!"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of eating here tonight.  Arrived with a friend and the restaurant was ready to close in 15 minutes.  The owner was so gracious he extended his hospitality and was more than willing to serve us our meal and stay as late as he needed.  He went above and beyond bringing us samples of different dishes to try.   This was my first experience eating Moroccan cuisine and it was very tasty.  It was not overpowering with spices from the  Rosewater tea with mint to the lamb kabobs.  Would definitely go back.  It is casual and not a large restaurant but worth the visit.  :)"}
{"text":"The service in general was absolutely amazing, so sweet and kind! All of the food my mom and I were given were totally new, but being from Pakistani backgrounds, we didn't think the food would taste very different... We were wrong. It was so delicious, authentic and new to our palettes! There was also a date shake and some sort of iced tea with basil (different kind of tea), which at first tasted a bit odd, but we loved them around the 2nd/3rd sip! Overall great experience, cannot wait to come back here with more people to experience this great food(:"}
{"text":"Overpriced, not many choices. The only thing good here is hummus. Not worth the $20 I spent on lunch."}
{"text":"This is exactly what I expected it to be.  Unique and yummy!  I'm of middle eastern decent and I'm not pleased easily but the food here was simply delicious.  The beef and chicken kabobs were perfectly spiced and the couscous was buttery and fluffy.  Wow!!  The owner Abdul was very pleasant as well.  We will definitely dine here often."}
{"text":"This is indeed a hidden Gem;  I was waiting for one of these to arrive in Phx ever since I went to Marrakech, Morocco.  It just felt like Morocco!!!!  My partner told me about this little hidden place, so I took her for lunch and were we delighted!  The food and the date shakes are to die for.  To the owner Abdul, who treated us with much respect and hospitality we say: muchas gracias por su hospitalidad!!  Merci pour voter hospitalité !  We will come back soon, but next time with four more people!! :)  Amazing place..."}
{"text":"I'm not Moroccan but was there with someone who is. He says it's as authentic as it gets. The food and service were excellent."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my first visit and will definitely be back. The food was amazing. I ordered the lamb couscous and enjoyed every bite. The owner was very hospitable and was very attentive. I wish most business owners took as much pride as he does. I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"The seating is comfortable and the service was very attentive.  They had a large party arriving when i arrived so i was pleasantly surprised to receive such good service as it is a small location (which can often be overwhelmed by large parties).

The spicy Tangier hummus was delicious, and it came with a very soft flat bread.  It was a great starter.

I had the chicken Tanjine.  It was very savory and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It came with couscous (of course) which was perfect for soaking up all the juices.  There were small bones in the dish, which wasn't a problem, but something to be aware of.

The portion was generous, such that I could barely drink the date shake that arrived at the end of the meal.  In the past I have found date shakes to be overwhelmingly sweet - but not this one.  It's made with peanut butter and cinnamon and was really good.

I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Five of us went to this restaurant without any prior knowledge and WOW, were we pleased. The owner (Abdul) waited on us and made suggestions for our meal. We had the most delicious lamb and chicken, couscous salads, refreshing mint tea, and we were even treated to date shakes and baklava. We all agreed the meal was one of the best tasting experiences (and yes, it was an experience) that we had in a long time. We will be going back! Do not miss this place."}
{"text":"Please go here! You will not be disappointed. My husband and I took his family who is visiting to this place after a friend recommended it. The owner provided EXCELLENT customer service. It was so fun he makes his own menu for the day and feeds you what he has made. No menu necessary. It felt like a great ethnic experience and the food was AMAZING!! The owner, Abdul, is what makes the experience so awesome and welcoming. I've never been so pleased with a food experience. Will definitively make this a go to. Thank you, Abdul!"}
{"text":"Bread made on site is delicious! Very hospitable owners, love the olives. Wonderful beef with couscous, lots of vegetables. Will definitely be back as we work very close to here.  And must try the house hot tea!"}
{"text":"This place was FANTASTIC!

Just as we sat, owner served us warm tea, pita & hummus. I could have put that hummus on everything.  Beautiful flavor with a lingering spicy that was just delightful. 

We got 1 Lamb & 1 chicken to share.  It was so flavorful and the meat was tender.  Both dishes had a great balance between meat & vegetable.  After, we order a date shake.  Now, if have never had one then you are missing out.  The shake is water based and is not overly sweet.  It was so good I took some for the road. 

The owner gave us a Moroccan baklava.  You can taste the rose water.  This dish is very sweet but soooo yummy. 

This is our first time here and we will def be back."}
{"text":"Abdul is nothing short of magnificent! serving fresh delicious food in very generous portions.he ever so graciously included 2 awesome date shakes with our meal . definitely a new go to spot!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Very friendly and welcoming employees and authentic food.  I was surprised that we were the only customers for dinner on a Saturday. I will be telling my friends to come here!"}
{"text":"My family and I are Moroccan and we came here to eat hoping for a quick bite. What we didn't expect was to be served and treated like kings and queens, eating amazing food that tastes like home. My dad has come here to eat at least 4 times in the last week he loves it so much. It is more like eating a wonderful home cooked meal in someone's house in Morocco than a restaurant. I recommend the lamb kabobs and all of the Tagines, which are out of this world. But everything is fantastic so you really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"WOW!!! Saw this local restaurant advertised in New Times and was so pleased to have stopped in.  I am a sucker for traditional Moroccan recipes for the herbs and spices and stewing.  Home-welcoming service, authentic herbal and mint teas, fall-off-the-bone seasoned lamb, juicy and delicious chicken kabobs, and beautiful fluffy couscous.  Everything was so appetizing that we over-ordered.  But that seemed to be okay because we nearly cleared the plates and the food is surprisingly light that we didn't leave feeling bloated ;)  I am happy to have found this authentic style Moroccan gem in our own backyard.  Thanks Couscous Express, we will be back."}
{"text":"When my friend suggested we come for lunch I was excited, I hadn't heard of it before but got good reviews so we went for it.  As we were driving down the street I recognized the restaurant as one I have passed many times without a second glance, wow, I was missing out and didnt even know it.  
We walked in and were immediately greeted and sat at a booth with fabric bolsters.  We were asked what kind of tea we would like, my friends got sweet tea and I got unsweetened tea.  The sweet tea was not iced where as mine was.  It had an amazing flavor which we later found out was orange blossom.  We were then presented with a bowl of soup which was delicious but was too spicy for my liking, although my friends devoured theirs.  We were then given a plate of moroccan style hummus which also had a kick but this was delicious and it was served with a type of bread reminiscent of an english muffin but we all know it was not, it was fresh and delicious.  We all decided on a tagine of lamb. It was presented beautifully.  Large pieces of tender lamb, peas and potatoes were presented with a large side of fluffy couscous that was cooked perfectly, something I have not been able to accomplish at home.  Since we were the only ones here at the time, we got to talk with the owner Abdul and he is just such a pleasant and kind man.  He brought out some date shakes which are made with dates, peanut butter and milk! OMG it was delicious! I need that in my life often!   We were the only ones in the restaurant, which I hope will change because this place is amazing."}
{"text":"Delicious food and amazing hospitality. Abdul treated me like a beloved relative and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If you cannot make it to Marakesh, the next best thing is Couscous Express.  You will enjoy a wonderful dining experience.  Almost from the moment we were seated we were served a spicy humus with warm pita bread and tea.  I had Moroccan tagine with chicken and big chunky vegtables: a rich, savory stew with a subtle play of spices expertly prepared. My companion had lamb kabobs that were tender and juicy.  Everything is served with the fluffiest couscous. The portions are enormous. We had enough for another meal. After dinner we enjoyed coffee that had a touch of cardomon.  The chef/owner Abdul is a most  gracious host. He saw to our every need along with his wait staff.  I was transported to Morocco.  Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"The owner was so gracious and freindly :) and i loved the atmosphere, I felt like I was in Morocco.v very yummy vegetable tagine, and they sell authentic Moroccan Argan oil here!! would definitely come again!!"}
{"text":"Couscous Express offers a flavorful, authentic, savory experience. I have thoroughly enjoyed the soup, hummus, bread, and chicken couscous. The hummus had a hint of spice topped with appropriate portions of olive oil. The bread is thin like a tortilla, but sturdy enough to scoop the couscous and hummus. By the time I reached the main entree my belly was appeased. My hubby and I took our time, so eventually I found some room for the chicken and couscous. I loved every bite!  Fortunately, we have chicken and couscous leftovers, so I this evening I will enjoy the tantalizing flavors!"}
{"text":"Oh my word ... I have to remind myself to be really hungry when I come here. So much food, and very good food at that. Lightweight eaters, don't be deterred - you can always take leftovers home for continued feasting. Abdul has removed the little bazaar portion but that's a plus because that expands the dining area. Take note - this restaurant closes at 6 PM, so if you're thinking dinner, better be there 5:30 or earlier."}
{"text":"Never had Moroccan food before, so really didn't know what to expect. Normally, an anglicized name like \"Couscous Express\" would be a turn-off, but I saw the good reviews and decided to give it a shot. I am impressed.

The menu is intentionally very simple, and at first glance may appear to be rather expensive -- after all, most dishes are $12-13 bucks. What you may not realize, however, is that by ordering a dish, you're really getting a multi-course meal. It starts with the mint tea that you're offered, which is pretty tasty, but not complimentary (I believe it may have been at some point). However, you'll also get some sort of appetizer which seems to vary depending on the day. We were lucky enough to get bowls of bisara and fresh harsha bread (looks and tastes like pita), which were delicious. Bisara is a lentil-based and intensely flavorful soup. I would've been happy with a full bowl as my entire meal. We were then served sample date shakes, which were also extremely good if a little hard to describe. It tastes a little like a very tasty protein shake, I guess. The date shake is what the owner, Abdul, is known for, so be sure to try it.

We all ordered different entrees, each of which were good, but I highly recommend a tajine, if for no other reason than the experience of receiving it in a sizzling hot pot. I got the beef tajine, and my friend got lamb. Both were excellent, with very tender meat, sweet dates, and hearty vegetable chunks. True to its name, this place has excellent couscous, which is a grain you usually don't think of as standing out on its own.

I do wish the entrees were about half as big and the prices were lower. I ended up having a ton of leftover food to take home, which isn't a bad thing at all, but it isn't nearly as good reheated as it is fresh. I'd rather go more often and eat less each time. Also, I wish it was open later, as 6:30 is a pretty early closing time and makes it hard to get dinner there."}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you. Express doesn't indicate cheap fast food but it certainly means quick attentive service!  This unique Moroccan restaurant had amazing food and incredible service. The chef is the prime example of hospitality. They are very attentive! We had the lamb tajine and chicken kabobs. The best kabobs I've ever had at a restaurant. They even let Mako in to enjoy the meal with us!  This place certainly deserves its 5 star ratings."}
{"text":"I can definitely understand why Abdul Charra's restaurant has garnered the rave reviews it has.  Between the warm hospitality and the value, its awfully hard not to give this place high marks.  I came here for lunch with my brother on a Thursday eager to see what the hype was about and to get my first taste of Moroccan cuisine.  The restaurant is located a few blocks west of the 51 Freeway on McDowell.  The inside is nicely decorated and with Moroccan music playing in the background.  Parking is tough and the restaurant is a little dimly lit inside, but minor issues in the grand scheme of things.

As soon as we sat down, Abdul brought out some hot mint tea to our table.  A perfect refreshment on an unusually chilly day in the Phoenix area.  Shortly after that, Abdul brought out some fava bean soup and some warm fresh made bread.  Admittedly I'm a bit of a wuss with really spicy food and the soup packed a pretty good punch.  They must've put quite a bit of cumin in there.  No complaints about the bread though as the texture was pillow soft.  After that, we were provided with more of that delicious bread and a plate of homemade hummus.  This version had quite a bit of complexity with a wide variety of different herbs working here.  Garlic and chickpeas are there of course but I think I picked up a mild peppery mix in there as well.  And keep in mind this was all provided to us before we even had a chance to order our actual dishes.

I went the traditional route this go around and chose the lamb couscous.  They actually provide the couscous on the side and then deliver the slow cooked steaming hot meat, veggies, and broth in what looks like an iron bowl.   From there you mix the two as you see fit.  The couscous was perfect for soaking up all that beef broth and the meat itself was super tender.  I honestly don't know how I finished it, but I was determined to make it happen.  Outstanding meal.  To finish things off, I asked for a date shake, something pretty much all Yelpers say you have to try here.  As I understand it, the shake is essentially a mixture of ground up dates, peanut butter, and cinnamon.  Abdul recommended that I wait to have it until after my couscous dish as he said the shake was super filling.  He was right.  That said, the shake had a smooth pleasant texture so it acted as a nice palate cleanser to top of the meal.

Total cost for my lamb couscous, my brother's chicken couscous, a pair of date shakes, numerous hot mint teas, fresh baked bread, fava bean soup, hummus, tax, and tip came to about $36.  Considering how much food and drink we were provided, it was a spectacular deal.  Up until we got the check, I probably would've said 4 stars for this place, but what you get for the price pushes Abdul's place to about a 4.5.  When you can deliver good (at times great) quality hard to find food to the masses at a great price, you've earned this Yelper's personal admiration (and a return visit)."}
{"text":"There is no shortage of excellent reviews about the owner, Abdullah. He is as warm, gracious and kind as each review says.  I had the pleasure of visiting morocco several times and the meal is only as good as the experience. That being said the meal and the experience were phenomenal. I find myself in that part of Phoenix often and usually resign myself to mediocre Mexican food. Now, I found my new favorite eatery. Thank you, habibi for bringing your cooking and hospitality to us. In the end it was us that won the lottery."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. The owner was very friendly and kept bringing us different small dishes to try which was a nice touch and very welcoming. Atmosphere is unique but a bit dark and airy. Unfortunately I am only giving this place 2 stars because I was not at all impressed with the food. It was very bland and our meat dishes were served  lukewarm which I find a major turnoff when eating out. I will for fairness sake temper this review with the fact that I rarely appreciate Moroccan food and typically find it bland and uninteresting compared to other genres of middle eastern cuisine. The owner truly seemed like a genuinely nice man so I wish him well with his new endeavor. If you're a fan of Moroccan food it may be worth giving a try."}
{"text":"A recommendation from my pal Norm, always in good taste and never bad form. He always delivers with a solid five stars, so walk here or run or jump in your cars.

Couscous Express delivers phenomenal customer service and awesome food! We were seated, greeted, and before I could open the menu, I was chatting with my lady on how I hope they have hummus on the menu. I was jonesing for some of that garbanzo bean delight, I'm sure my hands were shaking from withdrawals; I've not had any in about two days and my home supply was depleted. No sooner then I had finished that thought, the waiter brought out some of the best tasting hummus I've had, and fresh out of the oven pita. Was this guy reading my mind, probably, their service is just that good. We ordered the beef couscous to share, which was a great idea because it was perfect sized for two 'small plate' eaters, but I totally could have killed that entire dish myself, and then some too. Oooh, it was so good!

After dining and sampling their house made date shake, I was assured by the waiter they had plenty more delicious food that he would love to serve me, especially their soup. I almost caved under the pressure, but I couldn't eat another bite; they sure do know how to make you feel like you're part of the family. Requesting my check, the waiter asked if we would like more hummus, more date shake, more anything, he is at our service. I'm pretty sure hat I replied with \"OMG, I'm so full and every bite was fantastic, I couldn't possibly take one ore bite!\"

I think I'm coming to the conclusion that I'm not a fan of dates, I've had them on a number of occasions and don't love them; more of a neither here nor there sort of thing for me. I'll probably give the date shake another try if I run into it again, but if you love dates, they've got one here to satisfy that craving.

Bring your friends, bring your family, bring your enemies too, if you're covering dinner at this spot, they'll change their mind about you. It's time to eat Moroccan food people, see you around and happy Yelping!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place, food, and owner! I loved my vegan entree and especially the delicious tea and the hummus--the best I've ever had actually. The owner puts love into his food and this restaurant. I will be a regular here for sure!"}
{"text":"Amazing delicious fresh clean food. Order anything and you will be pleased. I had the chicken couscous and it was awesome! Complimentary hummus and bread and date shakes! Love this spot."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. You have to treat yourself to this place! The owner and the service was great, it was like dining at home. In terms of food 5 stars!!!! Try the lamb"}
{"text":"Delicious! Wonderful food, great service. My sister wanted to surprise her husband for his birthday and this was the perfect spot. They took such good care of us. Even though they were not done with construction they made everything look wonderful, opened early and made the most delicious feast for us. Each course was delightful. The soup was rich, the carrots had just the right amount of spice, the lamb was tender, the couscous moist, the bastilla mouth watering and you must have the date shake! It's the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"My first experience with Moroccan food. Very simple, very good. You sit down and they immediately bring you a light mint iced tea- very refreshing. Then comes a spicy lentil soup with bread- also good. \"We only have beef, chicken or lamb\" Chicken for me. I believe the meats are marinated, slow cooked then shish kabob grilled. The cous cous is steamed. The veggies included potatoes, carrots, cabbage and peas cooked in Arghan oil with turmeric and spices. Very good. Then we were served date shakes that had peanut butter in them. This food was light but filling. Great desert cuisine for Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is really good! I took my meal to go and it was pleasant. Next time I will dine in just to experience good hospitality. The man behind the counter was super friendly and hospitable. 

By the way, get the lamb cous cous, it was amazing. I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"The food is delicious , great customer service, I will definitely will come back. M Azing!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about the experience I had eating here! The food is absolutely delicious. The staff is fun and makes you feel right at home. Every dinner starts with the most amazing hummus and ends with a tasty date shake. I couldn't ask for a better dining experience. I love this place."}
{"text":"What an amazing place to eat, I'm a big fan of Moroccan / Mediterranean Food, I had the Lamb Couscous with a side of spicy Hummus I loved it to the last bite, the Owner was friendly and welcoming, by far the Best Mediterranean restaurants in town."}
{"text":"I saw another review that said this place is like thanksgiving dinner....it's so true! A friend and I were finishing up a meeting and we decided to go to lunch. While we were debating on where to go, I opened up Yelp, saw this places great reviews and we decided to go on an adventure! 
When we got there, we were immediately welcomed by the owner/cook. We sat down and he immediately brought us warm bread and AMAZING hummus! Also brought us some hot tea. I'm not a fan of tea, but this was pretty good! Very sweet, with hints of floral. To be totally honest, we ordered the beef, but he brought us the chicken. We totally ate it anyway because it still looked so good. Seriously delicious! I will definitely be back. The owner was great and very centered around how the customers were doing."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. I wanted to try something different for my birthday lunch   so decided to come here.

The service is excellent. They are very friendly and attentive. Be prepared to spend some time here, we had about 7 different \"courses\" and the atmosphere is relaxed.

The sweet tea and hummus were great and the couscous was light and fluffy. I also loved the date shake, though it wasn't everyone's cup of tea. I can'twait to go back and highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We went today with our dining club.  Abdul made us feel like we were in his own home.   As soon as we wee seated, he started bringing out baskets of pita and plates of the best hummus we have ever had.  It was creamy, spicy, garlicky, yummy.  Hot tea was brought out which was very good.  I had iced rose water which I loved.  We had thick, creamy date shakes.  There were many different dishes to try and everything the we had was excellent.  When we were done, Abdul brought out a dish of individually wrapped Moroccan cookies for us.  
It is a small menu, but it has everything you could want."}
{"text":"Vegans beware!  We tried this place after a recommendation from a vegan & were a bit disappointed.  The food was tasty, but 2 vegans eat lunch which was a shared plate of vegetables...for $28??!!! REALLY!  The hummus was amazing & the service good, but we won't be returning due to the cost, sorry!"}
{"text":"Abdul served us. He was super hospitable. My parents had never had Moroccan an so it was great when he explained tajine and recommended it. It was delicious and perfect for a first time Moroccan experience. As we walked in we noticed he was giving a traveler some recommendations and directions around Spain. He seemed just as excited to do that as every other subject with every other customer. Great experience. Great food!!! I would definitely return!!! I was visiting my parents from New Mexico and think I will make it a tradition"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! From the food to the owner. Great hospitality! food is fresh, hot and delicious! I will be back."}
{"text":"A all inclusive meal, great hospitality and good food and decent prices. What more could you want?

Sit down and you will be greeted by bread, carrot and cabbage dip like salads, great olives, and an aromatic tea. You did not order this, but it comes with the meal. They are all well prepared and delicious.

You meal choices are simple.  Couscous with your choice of meat (chicken, lamb, beef) or vegetarian(stewed veggies in spice). Price for this all inclusive deal are about $10 +- $3 

And by all inclusive  it includes the mentioned dip and bread. small plate of a couscous veggie garbanzo bean salad, tea and even a desert bite. 

The service was great too, imagine visiting a family members house and their soul goal is to make sure you eat and eat and enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"This is the kind of restaurant Phornix foodies need to support if our town is going to grow up from a culinary standpoint. Because of the low key location and decor, this place qualifies as a hole-in-the-wall, but this ethnically diverse part of town already boasts San Carlos Bay next door and the amazing Noble Eatery down the street. We were greeted by Abdul and John, our waiter, immediately brought out some iced tea with rose hips followed by a plate of fresh hummus and warm pita. My wife ordered the lamb and I got the chicken. Both were excellent. The lamb had blueberries in it which was unusual but delicious. After, we got a milkshake which had flavors of dates and peanut butter. All the while, we felt like guests in someone's home rather than customers. We experienced true hospitality and a fantastic meal. We will be back."}
{"text":"My son and I went and loved the food. We had the lamb couscous, my toddler loved the restaurant and all of the food. Looking forward to bringing my husband!"}
{"text":"What a cool find!!! My friend told me about it and I just got to check it out this week. One man show. Very friendly. Great service. Yummy peas soup and tea was swrved right when we sat and it was perfect on that rainy day. Then we got to chose from a \"menu\" : chicken, lamb or vegetable:)
So good and fresh and delicous.
Will go back. Go try it!"}
{"text":"ALL ABOARD! THE MARRAKECH Express has arrived in Phoenix!

HIDDEN GEM ALERT!

This is a tiny but exotic Moraccon Restaurant with only four inside tables and four big bench tables outside. Much of the food they serve are slow braised meats that mostly come with couscous. It's like what your grandmother would prepare for you if she was Moroccan. The male owner was just like my grandmother. I kept telling him I was full but he kept bringing us more food. Pricing is very low and portions are very large. (currently they offer a $5.99 lunch special)

We entered not knowing what we'd order and then the owner introduces himself and makes light conversation with us. He tells us to sit down and he said he'd just bring food to us to try. 

We started with Date Shakes, Moroccan Mint Tea, House made Lemon Cured Olives, Fresh Baked Bread and Moroccan Carrots. It was all good and it was all fresh!

Next came a soup. It was thickened with Garbanzo Beans and had noodles. This was a goat based soup.

A BIG generous dishes of slow braised fall off the bone tender, beef ribs, and lamb arrive, a dish of stewed potatoes followed by a plate of tender flavorful dark quarters of chicken on a platter with more couscous and an assortment of vegetables.

We also tried tasting style chicken bastilla. That's a puff pastry stuffed with their really good and tasty chicken, cinnamon and powdered sugar. 

What a FEAST!

And it ended with house made Moroccan Desserts!

Pricing was very low and potions were very large.

A current grade \"A\" Maricopa inspection is posted.

The Restaurant Front is Rough but it's a Gem inside.

Parking might be difficult. (I parked next door)

Get your Couscous on at Couscous Express!

call them for their hours of operation  Hours at this time are M-F 10:30-5 and Saturday 11:00-4"}
{"text":"Didn't have to order anything. Brought out appetizers and main course that we're amazing. Even came with a belly dancing sash for my girlfriend."}
{"text":"Five of us went to this restaurant without any prior knowledge and WOW, were we pleased. The owner (Abdul) waited on us and made suggestions for our meal.  We had the most delicious lamb and chicken, couscous salads, refreshing mint tea, and we were even treated to date shakes and baklava.  We all agreed the meal was one of the best tasting experiences (and yes, it was an experience) that we had in a long time. We will be going back!  Do not miss this place."}
{"text":"The food is really great. I highly recommend trying this place out. And the hospitality is one of a kind"}
{"text":"I cannot recall having eating so GOOD, so FAST, anywhere. I'd just read the New Times review, and knew only to expect a small menu. Basically, your choice of meat, lamb, chicken or fish (?) cooked (stewed) with vegetables along w/the couscous, of course. The to-die-for red pepper hummus and a slice of heavenly light moist flatbread was on my table before I made it out of the restroom. I chose the lamb, which arrived JUST as I'd wiped the last gratifying smear of hummus off of the plate, with the last shard of bread. I asked for the hot tea, and received an aromatic bouquet similar to Indian Chai, but unique all its own...sweetened just right. The host presented a 6oz cup of date shake for dessert, which I began to slurp with relish as I left. All that in merely 15mins! He advised that he changes the menu daily, so I guess you have to be flexible!"}
{"text":"Asides from enjoying a big, delicious lunch of fall-off-the-bone lamb tagine, steamed couscous, yummy tea, soft bread with tomato and olive dip, a date shake topped with cinnamon (certified food coma status after all the yumminess)...again put this all aside. The owner is one of the sweetest people in all of Phoenix. While I was there, I watched him hand out free iced tea to a woman with no money and he said the words 'don't worry about it, pay for it next time' at least twice. Just loved spending a couple of hours before my flight back to SD with him, his little daughter, and his sincere hospitality. I look forward to my next meeting in Phoenix mainly to visit this Moroccan hideaway again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I received a warm, friendly welcome by Abdul. The food was delicious and everything was fairly priced. We had the chicken and hummus plus the basil tea with a variety of desserts. All of it was delicious! 

Thank you, Abdul, for the wonderful food experience and great conversation! If we are back in the Phoenix, we will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I have been in Morocco and my origin is from France. So I know couscous, tagine and all the good stuff from Morocco. After 18 years in the US I am glad that Abdul opened a restaurant here in Phoenix. I went today for Christmas day and we got his couscous. Thank you so much to the owner, Abdul. Not only we have been welcomed with tea, humus and bread when we went to pick up our order but once at home we had an excellent surprise to eat one of the best meal we could only dream about. Abdul you made our day. Thank you again."}
{"text":"Our first time here and the atmosphere was great! The customer service was perfect and our food came out hot and fresh. The flavor was amazing. After we ate, we shared a date shake. It worked out to be the perfect sized dessert. I'd highly recommend Couscous Express!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!  Food was incredible.  My two year old daughter couldn't get enough of the date shake and humus.  Every dish we had was fantastic and the owner was very involved and super nice, it's apparent he truly has a passion for good food and pleasing his customers.  We will definitely be going here on a regular basis, more than worth the 20+ minute drive."}
{"text":"Moroccan home cooking!  Abdul runs an incredible place here.  A small, simple, and incredible menu."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my girlfriend for a late lunch. We hadn't been and didn't really know what to expect. It is a charming space and we were greeted warmly and immediately by the owner Abdul. 
We decided to dine in and were immediately served water and hot tea, flat bread, olives, and a warm spiced carrot salad! Very nice.
He gave us a quick run down of Moroccan cuisine and we were ready in a fairly short time. My girlfriend chose the lamb and I chose the beef. 
The meals were served with a generous helping of cous cous, and both entree's served in tajines which were layered with steamed vegetables and our choice meats.

Bottom line, the meals were delicious, hearty, and reasonably priced. The beef could have gone a little longer as the fat hadn't completely rendered and it was a bit tough but otherwise flavorful and enjoyable. The service was impeccable and the atmosphere was inviting and very comfortable. 

Abdul also offered us date shakes which were rich and yummy!

Great place. Would recommend and will return many times!!!"}
{"text":"At the first moment you walk in you feel welcome 
Start with the minimalistic authentic decorate 
The atmosphere let you feel for few minutes that you sit at street restaurant in one of the alleys in Marrakech market in morocco. 
About the food
The couscous taste like a dreamy cloud. 
I start smiling on my first bite and that smile just getting bigger every time
All the couscous dishes are amazing 
Vegetables/chicken/ beef/ lamb
However my favorite is the lamb
That cooked for hours and the fat melt in the sauce 
Also they serve Dailey home made dish/ salad
With pita bread. Hot and fresh. 
They make there a home made ARISA. It's a mix spices a bit spicy but not like hot sauce that's the real deal. 

Every dish serve with mint tea
And if you lucky you gonna have the honor to enjoy the one and only dates shake. 

Enjoy your next meal..."}
{"text":"Holy cow... This place is amazing!!! Such a hidden gem! Immediately upon entering you are greeted warmly with some warm home made pita and hummus and tea. We ended up getting the vegetarian couscous and I can't get over how tasty it was. My favorite part food wise was how perfect the potatoes were cooked in the couscous. I also loved the aesthetic inside. It felt like we were in morocco. I also enjoyed ending the meal with a date shake!"}
{"text":"Loved Cous Cous Express. It is a nice hole in the wall place with amazing food and service. The cous cous is served in a platter (unless you order vegetarian) for the table so order a couple of dishes and share. I recommend the lamb. It was very tender and flavorful and the date shakes are the best part. The Chebakia is a very sweet treat at the end and similar to an item served in Indian Restaurants."}
{"text":"After a failed attempted to check out Couscous Express I was pretty excited when an 2nd opportunity popped up to meet up with Norm, Jon and Jennifer O to try them out, we met up on a Thursday afternoon little before 4pm.

I was a few minutes late, so everyone was already at the table, and there was fresh naan like bread, but small and fluffy, with amazing tasting hummus, spicy and flavorful, so good it was hard to stop eating it!

Was served a glass of fresh mint tea, which was great tasting, and also some hot sweet tea, it too was great, just a little too sweet for me.  

The menu is on the wall and it's pretty simple, I went with the chicken kabobs that came with couscous and stewed veggies, this dish, though simple was amazing, the chicken was perfectly seasoned and cooked, the stewed veggies made me think of comfort food, the couscous was fluffy and cooked perfectly, in fact I loved it! 

Abdul and John (aka Francois) took care of us perfectly! When the meal was done, Abdul brought us each date shakes, now the flavor of these were perfect, but the texture reminded me of egg nog, and I just am not a fan, but please don't let that stop you, because it's a delish little drink! Also brought to the table were some amazing dessert pastries drizzled in honey, just delish! 

Excellent service, perfect meal, looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Excellent personable service, and amazing food. Had the chicken couscous, mint tea and a date shake. Would highly recommend checking this place out. Cool environment, too. Felt like I was in Marrakech!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious couscous! I haven't had Moroccan food this good ever in the US. Reminds me of what I had in France. The owner is super nice."}
{"text":"Absolutely superb! The food was amazing!! Some of the finest Moroccan cuisine I have eaten and The service was kind and created a very warm atmosphere.I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone wishing this cuisine!!"}
{"text":"One word. AMAZING! From the minute you walk through the door you're greeted by the friendly and generous Abdul. We sat down and started reading the menu from the wall. Abdul went up to us immediately and asked us what we wanted to drink, he suggested the mint tea and it was delicious! He also brought us fresh warm flat bread and this small plate of sautéed chopped carrots which was delicious! I ordered the lamb cous Cous and my husband ordered the chicken Cous Cous. My lamb was amazing, the meat literally melted off the bone, it was so tender and juicy. My husbands chicken was also juicy and flavored to perfection. As we were enjoying our lunch Abdul offered us the date shake. Do it, it is delicious!! When we received our tab, he only charged us for the two entrees!!! We obviously left a large tip for the amazing service and food! Thanks Abdul, we will return!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt a truly memorable experience. Exceptional service by Adbul.  Wife Maleeka creates dishes of extraordinary flavors.  Unbelievably wonderful."}
{"text":"This was one of the best dinning experiences I've ever had. The food was amazing and the customer service was even better. I will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"I loved it. Great couscous, great bisara soup and great service from Abdul. Will surely come again, soon!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! I threw my husband a surprise birthday dinner party here because of his love for Moroccan food. Met with Abdul in advance and he prepared my sister & samples so I could decide on the courses. Everything was bursting with flavor! My husband and guests were very pleased & excited with every dish that was served during the celebration... The delicious food kept coming and coming until we were all so satisfied ... Literally stuffed cause we couldn't stop eating. 

Not only was the food fantastic ... The hospitality and service here is unbeatable ... So inviting and accommodating that we felt as if we were Abdul's family. We will defiantly return to this gem of a find regularly. Thank you Abdul for the delicious food and taking such good care of our guests... My husband had a very happy birthday at Couscous Express."}
{"text":"Are you for real?! This place is ridiculous, small menu big flavor! The lamb melts in your mouth while the flavor of the tangine makes you close your eyes and just appreciate all the wonderful aromatic spices used to create it. Do yourself a favor and just walk in to smell the place."}
{"text":"I have always drove by this place and I finally decided it was time to take a peak. I couldn't have been any more satisfied. Abdul was so nice and welcoming. The place its self is beautiful. Full of color and so traditional ! and the green mint tea, hands down best tea i have ever had !! the food was also very delicious. Definitely coming back :)"}
{"text":"Finally made it here! I've passed by it so many times with its yellow halal sign and cute outside decor hard to miss. It's a small, cozy restaurant and it was empty when we visited (good for us: faster and more personable service). We ordered our vegetarian couscous plates at the counter along with date shakes. Abdul brought us the pita bread and hummus which were both amazing! I usually eat the dip classic, with garlic and lemon juice, so the spicy flavor was a nice change. Delicious bread too. We also got hot tea. The couscous plate was yummy, only thing I would add is some sort of hot sauce or spices to kick things up. And my favorite part: the date shake! It was my first time having one and it was incredible. Simple concoction: dates, peanut butter, milk and cinnamon sprinkled on top. Wow. 
Owner was great, made sure to check on us and ask if we wanted more shakes and bread, and wanted to give us tea to go. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I'm here right now eating the most amazing food. I feel like I'm in another place. I'm in love and will be back soon."}
{"text":"Very friendly owner serving generous portions of great Moroccan food. Be adventurous and try the fish head, it was delicious! Our favorite restaurant while in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Was there for lunch... Place empty... Didn't ask me if I wanted the free tea which was not good and no menu but menu written on a board on the counter which you can't read from far, and service not the great. Food ok. Expensive for lunch. Area creepy.. Moroccan Paradise is way better and less expensive and nicer environment. Would not go there ever. Service sucks"}
{"text":"Amazing food and the owner is super friendly! I especially love the tagine and couscous."}
{"text":"Let's just say I was pleasantly surprised with how well our evening turned out.  My wife and I gang out with some \"foodies,\" and they invited us here for a dinner out.

After driving by twice, we finally found it.  We walked in and found our group in the corner booth area.  It was the only area that could handle our party of six.

We didn't really order any food, which I found fun.  I just said, \"Bring us whatever tastes good.\"  It could have been taken as me being a rude S.O.B., but we got what we ordered!!  :)

We had the lamb, beef, and chicken dishes.  All were served with couscous and stewed vegetables.  Everything was perfectly cooked, tender and flavorful.

Thank you for a great meal and pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I heard good things about Couscous Express, so I tried them for lunch. 

First they bring out a glass of hot tea. Then an appetizer of hummus and bread. The bread was hot and tasted fresh baked. The hummus was good. A bit different than any I've had before. It was a little spicy, like it had some chili pepper in it. 

Then a bowl of couscous was brought out along with the Chicken Tagine. The bone in chicken was fork tender. The flavor was great. The owner was friendly. Only bad thing to say is the menu isn't large. But what they do offer is very good. Today was a choice between chicken, beef, and lamb tagine or kabobs. I will visit again to try the date shake."}
{"text":"The owner has since this review sent an email with an apology and asking me to return and try the restaurant again. I will, at a future time, re-review this restaurant under my usual caveats - They will not know when I am coming, I do not identify myself, and good or bad it gets reviewed so that it is honest."}
{"text":"I'm sorry the owner contacted me to make sure that everyone knows he didn't say that people like their chicken undercooked he said they like their chicken rare. Wtf!! I never said my wife didn't like the 

From the owner enjoy!!

{"text":"Loved the food! The owner was very friendly. I will definitely bring my husband and daughter, who is a vegan, to this place."}
{"text":"We had a great experience.  Nice people there and great food.  Sat down and they started bringing us great soup, flat bread, carrot salad, and tea.  Then we had the chicken tagine with couscous.   Loved it!  
Thanks again for the shakes too!"}
{"text":"Great Hole in the Wall for authentic exotic Morrocan meal. Abdul is very warm
and welcoming. I planned to order take out but he wanted me to try their Morrocan tea for free with spicy delicious humus and warm bread. It was awesome. 
He also gave me a small glass serving of date shake it was fantastic. 
Epic hospitality and service. I  ordered 2 meals to go and they were expressly delicious."}
{"text":"Beyond impressed with this restaurant. Upon entering we were immediately greeted with friendly and quality service. We were sat and had a stew and bread brought to our table. The stew was hearty with a little spice and the bread was soft, fluffy, and fresh. We were also given date shakes. The shakes do not use any milk or ice cream, just very fresh dates and water. They were chilled to perfection with a garnish of cinnamon. Our group was also presented with 3 teas; an iced tea, a warm sweet tea, and a cold sweet tea. All were great and very refreshing. Try them all!

When it came time to order, the waiter Abdul asked if we wanted to just be surprised for our group of six people, which we chose. We had 3 stews brought to us; lamb, chicken, and beef. They were all incredible, each with their own intricacies and spices. The lamb was especially good; sweet with a subtle tang. We also had 2 plates of chicken kebabs brought to us. The spice mix on the chicken was phenomenal and it was grilled to perfection. 

Parking is in the back of the restaurant, follow the gravel driveway along the side. The interior is very comfortable.

The only downside to my experience was not having a second stomach so I could eat more. Abdul and John truly make you feel like you're family when you're there.

I will 100% be returning."}
{"text":"Very few restaurants cause me to drop dietary defenses, but I must admit Couscous Express had me forgetting about my food concerns. This little restaurant on E McDowell is good for lunch and an early din-din.

It lives up to the 'express' in its name. The owner didn't have us sitting for long with an empty spot on the table. We wanted to try everything, so more or less ordered the whole farm.  Meat, fish, poultry, herbs and veggies, grains, roots, legumes, fruit, dairy. It was like a continuous parade of platters were being marched to our table and the owner accommodated us with extra plates to serve the food.  

All dishes are suitable for one person, but if you don't come with a big appetite two people can share a plate and still get full. I managed to finish ev'ry bite with no leftovers. Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

The nitty-gritty on the dishes: 

- Date shake. How do you say YUM? I could wake up and drink that stuff for breakfast. It was thick, peanut-y, and not too sweet. Bet I could work through the entire morning on one date shake. Protein shake? We don't need no stinkin' protein shakes. We gots date shakes, B-otch.
- Tea was okay. Maybe if it was served after the meal and a hotter temperature I would have enjoyed it more. 
- Hummus was deliciously flavourful. I could eat a tub of it.
- Bread was a round of light fluffy flour that I prefer much more than pita. 
- Couscous side was absolutely delicious by itself. Whatever seasoning he used to give that salty/cheesy flavor was a surprise to the taste buds. And the texture was perfect. I took some to go and ate it by itself in front of the telly. Instead of handfuls of buttered popcorn, I had my spoonfuls of cheesy steamed couscous. What?!  Don't think I'll ever ask for another pot of boiled couscous. Steamed only going forward.
- Couscous salad. Mmmm-meh. Call me boring, but I prefer green salads. Gotta get greens.
- Lamb couscous was tender and cooked just right.
- Tangines were delicous.  Spiced right and flavourful, not at all oily - obviously simmered in their own juices. 
- Bastilla. My first time having it. If I re-order, it would have to be as a main dish with lots of side veggies. I like the top sweet crunchy phyllo but could do without the powdered sugar.  

Nitty-gritty on the decor:

Simple and tasteful. Decorated with hookahs, food stuffs, and Argan oil for sale. Changes have been made since the earlier reviews this year. To get an idea of the new layout, see the image that reviewer Franko L uploaded on May 11, 2015. There are about five small tables inside and one for a larger party. The center of the dining area is completely open so it has the appearance of plenty of space. Outside there are two large wooden tables. 

Separate restrooms for fe/male is great for a such a small place but if you wish to avoid any claustrophobic winces and cramping I suggest you use the loo before getting to the restaurant and carry wet-naps to clean your hands before eating.

Nitty-gritty on the owner:

A genuine host. There were other customers dining as well and they were getting served just as fast as us. Obviously the owner knows what he's doing. Definitely in his element with this petite-sized venue. He encouraged paced dining, conversation, and pure enjoyment of the meal. No customers were rushed into ordering or paying.

Expectations:

I wish there were more vegetables in the meals rather than so many potatoes. The few veggies I had were overcooked.

After reading other yelp reviews and drooling over pictures of food, I was looking forward to having the carrots and olives appetizers. Oh well, next time."}
{"text":"We were looking for something different to have for lunch when we almost drove right past Couscous Express. We were up for something different so we stopped in.  Immediately we were welcomed and given tea.  The smell of the food was great so we ordered - and the food was great - exotic but also familiar. The chicken was just spicy enough to make you want more after every bite.  Very affordable and friendly service too!"}
{"text":"Great food, healthy and very friendly service. Humus was great, as were tangine with lamb and chicken. Portions were large, two people could split one if not too hungry."}
{"text":"Abdul was a great host; we came in with a group of 6, and he brought us several small plates with bread and hummus (SO. GOOD.), as well as individual couscous dishes (including a vegetarian one for myself). Date shakes followed for dessert, and Moroccan iced tea was plentiful. Their customer service was great, and the food was very flavorful. He charged us $12.95/person, which was a great deal considering the large amount of food! Nice ambiance and decor for a small seating area, felt cozy. Definitely recommend, and hope to go back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is a trip to morocco! Try the tea and the date shake. The bread is awesome. The owner is a gracious host and gave us a bunch of stuff to try. I love the decorations in the place too! A fun trip out"}
{"text":"Great Middle Eastern food.  Amazing customer service.  I ordered the lamb dish to go and while I was waiting Abdul let me try their hummus, ice tea, and date shake.  All were great, but I was surprised how good the date shake was.  I'm not a huge fan of dates, but the cinnamon and peanut butter mixed with the dates is amazing.  Lamb and couscous were great and filled me up with leftovers for later.  Definitely coming back with my wife and friends to get the full dine in experience."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars, I would.  After hearing several neighbors raving about this place, I jumped at the chance to give it a try when I unexpectedly had time for a Monday lunch date with my leading man.  The second I walked in the door I knew I was in for a great lunch experience.  From the mint tea and spiced roasted something (carrots, I think) with homemade bread that arrived at my table as soon as I sat down, to the couscous, to the sample of the date shake, the food was delicious (and we have leftovers for tomorrow's lunch!).  But what was even better was the phenomenal service, incredibly friendly in a way that added to the experience and never felt intrusive, attentive but not hovering, the staff (felt like the owners) made sure we had plenty of food and drinks and had any question answered and that we felt welcomed.  This place has been open only about a month, I am torn about being an early evangelist for this place and wanting it to stay a secret.  However, everyone should taste this food and enjoy the amazing owners and make sure this place stays open for many more unexpected lunch dates.

The food:
Started with the spiced roasted carrots with flatbread.  Carrots had a kick, but we polished the plate off, making sure our bread picked up every last bit.  This took more bread than initially served, but the staff made sure we got more as soon as we polished off our first pieces.  We also were offered little bowls of olives.  As an olive lover, I went right for it.  The spices on the olives were great, I also finished this off.  And we also both had hot mint tea.  This is not peppermint tea from dried mint in a tea bag, it's fresh brewed from fresh spearmint, and is delicious and not too strong.

For our main meal, I had the vegetable cous cous, leading man had the chicken.  The sauce was fantastic, the vegetables were soft in a good way and were great on a fork with cous cous and the sauce.  The chicken was falling apart and really flavorful, a perfect match for the cous cous and vegetables and sauce.

We also had little samples of the date shake.  Not being a huge fan of dates, I was wary, but it was good.  Not too sweet, but very thick and rich and lots of cinnamon."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here tonight with another couple who are our close friends. This was the first time for all of us eating here and the first time they had had Moroccan food. I have previously eaten at a number of other Moroccan restaurants around the country. I recommend Couscous Express for the delicious food, the warm atmosphere and the overall delightful experience we had. Abdul treated my friends and I like we were old friends of his. We all walked away knowing that this will be a go to place for us for as long as it is open."}
{"text":"I've been told my reviews are full of emotion. but I just cant separate it. 

Going to Couscous Express is not just great food it is an experience. You sit down and get this amazing hot tea (so good I got a to go cup just to have while working at my desk at work) and then the food. We had no idea what to get because even though the menu is small everythign sounds so good. 
So our waiter came by and he chose for us. 

We got the hummus first, it had an amazing spice level, the bread was great.. and then I was starting to get full....

The main dishes came out and I hated my self for not pacing myself. Its liek Thanksgiving dinner all over again. After taking a breather.... I started and WOW. just WOW. it was simply amazing.

I preferred the vegetarian dish because you can taste the spices more but this doesnt mean the meat one wasnt good. 

Definitely going again. LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE. 5+ STARS!."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for a Moroccan restaurant to come to Phoenix for over a decade.  I was so excited about that we ate there the first day I heard about it.  

As soon as we sat down I was treated with Mint Tea and olives.  A smile spread across my face right then and they kept me happy through the whole meal.  Before I got more than a couple of olives in my mouth they were back out with a small plate of Couscous.  It was delicious and had me craving the main course.

We both ordered the beef.  We got a large plate of beef and vegetables with couscous.  The meat so super tender and were cooked perfectly.  I could not have been happier.  I could not even come close to finishing my dinner.   

Just when I started slowing down they brought us date shakes.  I don't know if they are always peanut butter flavor but these were and again I really liked it.  I forced myself to finish it because it was so good.  When it was gone they gave me another but I was down for the count and could not finish it.

I am excited to go back."}
{"text":"Wonderful delicious and savory food. Owners are really nice and treat you really special. Come here for a healthy lunch that will have you groaning in savory delight. Come here and try this you cant regret it. As a person who almost only eats vitamin and nutrient rich foods, couscous express offers a delicious option for diets such as mine. Go here if you're hungry looking for a value or if you are looking for the most quality for you dollar; this place delivers both."}
{"text":"Amazing  the  best Moroccan I've ever had. Get here and enjoy. The food is delicious and the ambiance, highlighted by the music of Edith Piaf, is great. This small husband and wife operation if a delight. Be sure to have the tea; they'll even tell you how to brew it. The complimentary date shake at the end of the meal was really good. The bread was excellent. The tajines, I had beef and my wife lamb, were great and served authentically. I have to add that for the price and given all the little adds, this is a great buy. We will be back and hope they will start serving dinners so we can bring our friends."}
{"text":"I have only eaten Moroccan food once or twice before. But after dining at Moroccan Paradise across from ASU, I liked it so much that I decided to try another Moroccan restaurant the following day. That's when I discovered Couscous Express, which I read is famous for their couscous and date shakes.

When I entered Couscous Express, I was personally greeted by owner-chef Abdul who hails from Tangier, Morocco. Even before shown the menu, he had dropped off a few complimentary starters - a warm cup of bitter gunpowder tea, a bowl of mildly spiced hisara soup that was lentil based, and a microwaved piece of harsha that's like a thick disc shaped pan fried bread. Abdul told me to take my time, he would take my order after I finished the appetizers. I have eaten at Arabic restaurants where a hearty lentil soup is the first item served, and the hisara soup tasted very similar to that. It's like the \"miso soup\" of Middle Eastern meals. 

The menu was very simplistic, permutations of either kabobs or tagine, with the choice of vegetable, chicken, beef, fish, or lamb. For that reason, there was no paper menu passed out. Just tell Abdul what you want. I chose the lamb tagine, after having had chicken the previous night.

The tagine was essentially an individual serving potted stew, very soupy, containing a melange of boiled vegetables, raisins (instead of dates), and meat. I ate it with steamed couscous which was prepared reasonably well - very moist and soft, somewhat fragrant, a hint of raisin-like sweetness. The couscous was not as spongy as rice that I eat more frequently, but it did taste good with the hearty low-sodium broth. I especially liked the broth because it had natural sweetness from the boiled vegetables. The broth was light but still relatively savory, it tasted great even on its own.

Unfortunately, I was extremely let down by one aspect. I ordered lamb but I'm convinced that I received beef, although one of the servers assured me it was lamb. I don't think it was goat meat either. The lamb tasted really similar to the boiled beef stock that I add to my Chinese soup. No gamey flavor, tough resilient texture, very lean meat. It was my least favorite aspect of the tagine. In my opinion, using lamb or goat shanks (bone-in) would make the tagine taste infinitely better.

Nonetheless, I had a positive experience at Couscous Express. Hospitality was the most memorable aspect of the meal. Chef Abdul treats customers like family, and dining in felt like being a guest in his house. It's a one man show in the kitchen but he somehow finds time to bus tables. Chef Abdul even refilled my broth and bowl of couscous without asking. It's impossible to leave hungry from this place.

Between Couscous Express and Moroccan Paradise, I would pick Couscous Express if I wanted a more soupy and stew-like tagine, and choose Moroccan Paradise if I were craving for a more of a purely steamed bowl where a gravy is served on the side."}
{"text":"Generous owner just like in Tanger!
Great food, tea is amazing!
You have to try this place, atmosphere is great, don't forget to stare at the ceiling it's just like in Morocco.
Couscous was rich with vegetable And fresh meat.
Bread was fresh, salad \"za3louka\" was delicious.
It's a unique place with rare food you won't be able to eat unless you travel a broad.
Kudos for opening such a place and serving amazing food.
From your Tunisian Customer :)"}
{"text":"Beef plate as well as the chicken were delicious. The soup was amazing with the freshly brewed tea."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this place will most likely be a 5 star in my book, but I need a second visit before I make that decision. The first time I tried to come to Couscous express I was very concerned, it was 45 min or so before closing time and they were all locked up... we thought maybe they had gone out of business! Luckily for me, they must have just closed early that day. So a couple weeks later, I decided to give it another shot, but to come in earlier this time. I met Jon H, Norm, and Monica O here for linner. 

This place was ridic! The people who work here (owners?) are so nice and accommodating. They started us off with two types of bread, one small round fluffy bread and one larger more dense bread and one of the best hummus type dips I've had.... a little spicy and packed with flavor. They also brought out delicious mint iced tea to sip and even a second hot sweet tea to try... both of which were great. For my entrée I got the beef tagine, which was huge! It had the beef and a bunch of veg (potatoes, dates, other delicious stuff) all served boiling hot in a tagine. With this came a huge amount of couscous. The meal was incredibly tasty, the couscous was light, fluffy, and delish... I could only eat a small amount, but was given a to go box and ended up making this one meal into 5 (the husband had some when I got home, and I had it for lunch, dinner, and then another lunch). We were then offered a date shake... so good... sweet, but not too sweet. They also brought out some fried honey cookie things, which I ate despite being ready to burst.

Take home point:  I have been raving to anyone who will listen about this restaurant and need to make my triumphant return to up this great place to a 5 star level. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Dang!
Stop everything and get to this place now!
Have the lamb. Have the chicken. Every single thing we had was perfect, and we had everything!
Real date shakes, not the ice cream ones that the tourists have at the schlock shops..
This is a little place like in another country, my gf said she would never stop in at places like this but I'm changing her attitude!
I think the owner is the chef and he came out to the tables to oversee everything. 
Like it should be."}
{"text":"Wow!  We had a horrible day of travel returning to AZ from a week in Ohio finishing with a final flight that was more wild than some of the roller coasters we had ridden at Cedar Point.  Before that flight we were planning on a big meal upon arriving in PHX to celebrate our return - but the flight left us all green and thinking a quick snack may be better.  Then we pulled up Yelp and found this place ;)  It was a bit sketchy looking from the outside and we had to drive past once to find the parking lot, but we've never let that stuff scare us off from trying a new restaurant as we learned a long time ago that some of the best food is hidden in the roughest looking places!

I didn't think to double check their hours and we pulled in right a few minutes after closing.  The owner was very apologetic and offered us food to go since it was their closing time.  We explained that we had just landed and still had an almost four hour drive to Yuma ahead of us so to-go wasn't going to work \"but thanks, we'll be sure to stop in next time we're in Phoenix\".  But upon hearing that he said \"I used to have a date shake place in Yuma, I know the drive you've got ahead of you - Sit, we'll stay and feed you for your drive\".  So we sat :D

Our daughter loved getting to sit on the couch and pillows at their largest table and before we even had our chairs under us there was wonderful iced mint tea in front of us and a small date shake for our daughter.  Then before we could blink we had some great mildly spicy hummus and amazing fresh pita bread, followed quickly by a second non-spicy hummus that was served as whole beans rather than pureed.  We could have left at that point and been super happy and satisfied!

The owner then apologized to us in advance that since it was closing time he wasn't able to offer the full menu - but the lamb couscous and the chicken were available.  We were already thinking the lamb sounded good so we went with it.  The serving was plenty for the two of us and he brought us date shakes as well.  I'm not normally a fan of date shakes but his were unlike any I've had before - less sweet and more savory with some wonderful spices and a peanut flavor that complimented the sweet dates perfectly.  

Our young daughter is a picky eater and was acting up a bit.  We finally got her to try the couscous only to be embarrassed by her spitting it out and wiping her tongue off.  But the owner just smiled and thanked her for trying it then gave her a scarf with plastic jewels and bangles on it which cheered her up greatly.  

We ended up stuffing ourselves silly and still had to ask for a to-go box :D  The cook came out and shared his own Yuma story with us as well and he was just as friendly accommodating as the owner.  It really felt more like being at a family meal than a restaurant they were so friendly and inviting.  They then gave my daughter a second scarf absolutely delighting her and earning them a little dance show from her in return.  

When the check came I was wondering if I had read it wrong.  There was no way that much great food and service could come with such a low price.  Between that and them staying open past closing to feed us I couldn't help but leave a generous tip as I felt I'd be cheating them not to.  Then as we were getting in our car the owner came out saying we were too generous and insisting on giving us a few small bottles of the argan oil they sell.  Jaw drop.

I don't normally give a five star review on one visit - but based on the other reviews I have no reason to believe that the experience we had was exceptional or unusual for this restaurant.  I'm already trying to think up some excuses to get back up to Phoenix soon so we can enjoy Abdul's hospitality and food again soon!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I just ate here and enjoyed our meals very much. We both had the chicken couscous, which was good, although the couscous, which was exceptional, outshone the chicken. Every meal comes with a free appetizer of carrot salad and preserved olives with bread, which was pretty good, although I felt like there was carrot overload, given that the couscous chicken also came with plenty of stewed carrots. The mint tea was good, but I wish it were poured over fresh mint and served a lite hotter. The meal also came with a date shake which had too much peanut butter in it for my taste, but my girlfriend loved it. In all, it was solidly good food.

I would like to see the menu expand, but perhaps that is asking too much from a restaurant with about six tables.

The prices are very fair: all of the above was $26, including tax."}
{"text":"This place is great! It seems like lunch is a pre-fixe menu, when we came in we were immediately brought delicious peppermint iced tea and AMAZING hummus. It was different and perfect, kind of peppery and tangy, and served with super fresh hot pita. Then we had the couscous- I got veggie and my partner had the chicken. Delicious! Then Abdul surprised us with date shakes which were seriously amazing. The place had awesome service, is decorated really funky and cool. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is delicious and the portions are large too. Been here several times and never been disappointed. The restaurant is run by one man who is very nice and happy to help with your order if you're not sure what to get. Very cozy atmosphere. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Friendliest staff with some great food on there menu!!! I woukd definitely suggest this 0lace to anyone who wants to have some good food in a friendly atmosphere. ..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The lamb tastes absolutely amazing and the chicken is delicious. Don't forget to get a date shake and definitely try the mint tea!  Service was outstanding. I will be a regular here"}
{"text":"Outstanding!!!
The meats were tender, the vegetables savory.  The staff was wonderful.

The proprietor is very professional, interacts with the guests and is very warm and friendly.

We will be coming back!"}
