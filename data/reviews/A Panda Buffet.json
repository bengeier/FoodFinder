{"text":"Adequate buffet with decent food. The lo mein is very good. Egg rolls are delicious. The fried tempura veggies are my fave. A good place to go if hungry."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. The place smells and it is so dirty, Threw the food out after we picked it up."}
{"text":"Great Chinese buffet for an surprisingly cheap price! Probably the best delicacy here is the coconut shrimp. Unlike the typical coconut shrimp you might find at, say, Red Lobster, this coconut shrimp is breaded and smothered in a creamy, sugary, sauce that is sure to rival any shrimp of any assortment you've ever had. And it's a buffet! So whip out that handkerchief and dig in!"}
{"text":"Super friendly employees and decent food for a buffet. They have a huge variety and tons of vegetarian options which is rare for a buffet!"}
{"text":"Good...decent chinese buffet. They just decreased the price. I like coconut shrimp and lo mein...they are so good. Now only $4.99 for lunch, more than worth."}
{"text":"I have only eaten take out buffet.  It's ok very typical. Maybe worth eating but not digesting. Yeah that was a WTF type of  me comment!"}
{"text":"Run of the mill buffet, but not spectacular. Good price through 3:30, then dinner prices. They have some fun offerings too. Crawdads & lots of sushi today.   It will fill a hankerin' for Chinese buffets, but won't set the world on fire."}
{"text":"Large variety of food on the always fresh buffet.  All you can eat $6.99 until 3:30 PM including fruits, salads, desserts ( ice cream, cake, cookies, puddings), sushi, three soups( great hot and sour, egg drop, won ton) and the usual Chinese entrees. Dinner is slightly higher and more entrees available. Large room for private parties, plenty of parking. Always clean. I go once a week and the food is never dry, overcooked or left out too long. Servers are attentive even though it's a buffet. Add on crab legs anytime for $3.99 Can take out by the pound from the buffet or order from the large take out menu.  Need to eat good Chinese food in a hurry, this is the spot. My favorites are the coconut shrimp and seafood egg foo young."}
{"text":"There was your average fanfare, everything was good, if not slightly above average for a buffet.  They had things that i do not see at buffets very often, like crawdads, a variety of fish based entrees, spiky general tso's chicken and the crab rangoon was really exceptional.  The only problem with the average level of the food was the far below average attention to signage.  The service was on par with what they are supposed to do and did watch our table to collect plates as often as we left them.   Even though the food and service were average, the television playing the ambiance music of popular classic piano songs with a slight asian feel did make the atmosphere quite whimsical.  But what really made the music special were the random images that went with one song, and as my ten year old daughter was watching, asked my wife innocently, \"what is that?\" As my wife looks up, she says, \"Well, thats apparently a nude beach.\""}
{"text":"Start with the name. Unassuming, humble, free of hubris, inclusive. It doesn't purport to be THE Panda Buffet or Panda Buffet, but A Panda Buffet. It lures you in by making you think, \"Gee, this is just another Panda Buffet. Look at that indefinite article.\" That's what they want you to think.  Inside there are turtles and angels. The turtles loaf around doing turtle things in a wee fountain near the entrance. The angels wear uniforms and patiently wait by the cash register to seat you. The ethereal wait staff put you at ease, soothing you for the culinary onslaught to come, and bring you enough Dr Pepper to drown a capybara.    I apologize, but I'm vegan. So I can't really rate most of the fare at the buffet. But I can tell you that my friends are happier than chimpanzees at war when they're stuffing their faces with delicacies like \"cheese crab\" and \"salt and pepper frog.\"   As far as the vegan food is concerned, the stir-fry tofu is my hero (it comes with baby corns!!) and the sesame seed sweet potato (I call them \"squishy balls\") shall marry my firstborn son. There's also some savory curry fries, green beans, plenty of rice (duh), and oh screw it, just LOAD UP ON TOFU.  I really want to submit a bunch of inside jokes that have been developed at A Panda Buffet. But you wouldn't understand references to space cats, red goo sauce, or hot dog bread. Point is, this isn't only a place to gorge yourself on perfectly decent Chinese food until it seeps out of your eyeballs and drips onto your distended belly, it's a place to meet with friends, fall in love, give birth to a baby girl, bury your favorite cat, or run a small money-laundering operation. A Panda Buffet is my favorite place on earth."}
{"text":"The food is great (most of the time) but the restaurant is not very clean.  the employees are very friendly and helpful.  It is also very close to my house so it is a place where I go out to eat a lot."}
