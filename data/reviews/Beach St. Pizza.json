{"text":"Let me tell you, the people who work there at Beach Pizza were extremely polite, helpful and very, very cool.  Great pizza great flavor very New York style the garlic and ham is so good The ambiance was very positive, I noticed all of the customers always smiling Huge menu from subs to wings and desserts I give it thrums up they have a great deal 9.95 out the door medium with 2 toppings all the time it a killer deal in comparison to the commercialized pizzerias down on the rd no names to be said thumps up"}
{"text":"I finally got to try this pizza restaurant and it was so yummy! I will forever now come here when I have my pizza cravings, they have delivery as well. Really cute decor inside ad the staff is so nice."}
{"text":"Order came wrong. I called to tell them.. In a very bland way the girl says \"so do you want another one?\" No... I'll just eat the wrong one. Second one came wrong as well... And to top it off, they wanted the old pizza back! Seriously? What do they do, recycle? What about so sorry sir , please keep the pizza and we will send one right out. I called and asked for the manager.... Guess what? Same girl... She is solely responsible for me not returning.... Mistakes happen... It's what you do after that... She failed miserably. Sad, I used to order beach pizza 15 years ago and it was always great...."}
{"text":"New ownership is awful. Who closes as early as 7pm??? On top of that, called at 5pm on a Wednesday (supposed to be open until 7 on Wed.) and straight to voicemail. Arrived at the place only to find a sign on the door saying it was \"closed early.\" New owners even changed the cheese and sauce and now put way too much sauce on their pizzas. Completely lost the taste of the Beach Pizza weused to love. Terrible business."}
{"text":"I have been going to this pizza place since 2002. I don't know why you would change the sauce and the cheese after all these years. You had something great going on. It never bothered me to pay a couple extra dollars for something good. I hope you go back to the old cheese and sauce."}
{"text":"Go to pizza!!! Best flavor!!! $5.99 for a medium.... It is on my speed dial... I have been ordering from them for years.... They also make these ranch breadsticks that my kids have never tried, because they never make it home.... Lol!"}
{"text":"We have been getting pizza's from Beach Pizza since they open some 4 years ago.  Having a wife from NY makes it hard to just pick up any old pizza.    There is only 3 pizza joints that make the grade and Beach Pizza is one of them. So getting on that list from a pizza snob like my wife really counts for some thing.  So give them a try and you will have a new favorite pizza joint."}
{"text":"Ordered a antipasto chopped salad. . What  I received was a box of old lettuce and absolutely no meat or veggies. . Really? ??"}
{"text":"Ok...everyone has their own likes and dislikes....so, \"opinions are like...well, you know the rest\" All I can say is we ordered a pizza for delivery online...it showed up hot and fresh, sooner than promised, and it was delicious ! It was our first time ordering from Beach Pizza...we ordered the  \"Del Ray\" (we were feeling adventurous) with added pepperoni....and, wow, were we surprised ! We'll be trying everything on the menu now !......excellent !"}
{"text":"We used to go to Beach Pizza in Playa Del Rey, CA and was happy to see one here in Vegas.  The pizza is wonderful!!!!  Good selection of kids items as well.  We have ordered food multiple times now and have received consistent food and service."}
{"text":"UGGG!!!!Cant get the order straight when I called they were not listening to the complaint proceeded to ask me what I wanted to order Then I asked him to stop talking and listen well what do you think happened next,,,you got it the ole' hold button aaahahaa then the gal whom took my order got on the phone and told me she would make another..NO THANKS It wouldn't have been so bad but they were not busy and I did repeat the order several times"}
{"text":"Good pizza.  Baked fingers which is always a nice change of pace. Owner is super friendly."}
{"text":"I love the questions at the bottom of the page, and my answers to them may not be totally accurate.  But when it asks, \"Is this good for Breakfast - Dessert?\"  Well My personal answer has to be, \"Yes!\"  It's pizza ladies and gentlemen, and as we all know there are as many pizza variants as there are turtles holding up the earth.  So here's my personal story about Pizza, and Beach Pizza.  When I was a lad, on the cold Southern California mornings, each day I had a choice to make, go to school, or ditch out and head down to Newport Beach and go surfing.  More often than not, I'd have to elect for Surfing, and by lunch time, all those calories spent not learning would have to be replaced.  So out on the Balboa Peninsula there had to be 4 pizza by the slice places, each of them serving the super thin and greasy slice for $1.50 which you could load with free parm and peppers till you could feel fire in each bite.  As I matured more and started going down to Newport with my son years later I realized the pizza itself was wonderful as well when you weren't trying to live off the free cheese and peppers.  Needless to say, I was driving by Beach Pizza one day, contemplating on eating at the bar next door, or the subway or maybe just something from the deli counter at the grocery store.  I had a quick thought that it'd be hilarious if it was the same So. Cal. slice I was used to.  In a way, I'm kinda glad it wasn't, because it's phenomenally better!  It has all the decor and charm of a shoes-optional pizza by the slice boardwalk business, but the food is Excellent.  My pizza buying from Beach pizza goes like this: Day one:  Got a medium for lunch. Day two:  Everyone at work chips in for 3 larges out of jealousy (see day one) Day three:  Got 2 larges (less people working) and a medium to take home. Day four: Pizza boxes are piled nearly chest deep in our break room.  The word is out to our neighboring business who all come in for \"just a slice\" Weeks later:  I lie about going there now so I don't have to bring back more pizza than my car will carry!  It's like being on heroin!  Ok, I exaggerated a bit at the end."}
{"text":"Pizza and past is good but there service isn't that great.  I ordered delivery and the pasta order was wrong and very cold. I called and they said they would refund that portion but of courses they didn't.  I called back again and they said they had no idea who I was and I wasn't getting a refund as promised.  I don't complain about my orders but this was complete wrong and they said they were sorry and would make good on it but they did not.  Not to trustworthy and I wish they would respond to this posting."}
{"text":"Pleasant experience!!!   Ordered a cheese pizza with extra cheese.  While I may have had tastier pizza in the past, I can not fault this one.  It was prepared quickly, with-in  20 minutes and the staff was friendly and welcoming.  This is a nice little find for so close to home and reasomably priced.  No need to run all the way over to Costco for a pizza (no offense Costco, as we still love you)...  Good job Beach Pizza!!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time dining here. The new owners were working and were very helpful. My wife and daughter have food allergies, and they were very accommodating recommending menu items that they could eat. My daughter had a personal pizza with sauce and mushrooms and no cheese. She also got the wedge fries. She is a very picky eater, and she ate half the pizza and all the fries. My wife and I had the Manhattan Man pizza and a side of wings. The pizza is a thin crust, but is not dry like most thin crust. We did not get extra cheese, and the cheese to topping ratio was perfect. We didn't get to eat the wings as we couldn't stop eating the pizza. They will have to wait for tomorrow. I did see that they do delivery, so this is our new pizza place from now on."}
{"text":"The food was really not good. We were optimistic because they are located near our house. The optimism was misplaced. I felt like I was eating concession pizza. It was disappointing for a pizza joint. I asked my husband if he got it from the zoo. The ranch pull apart bread was weird. Their ranch dressing was mediocre packaged dressing. The appetizer sampler was very small and poorly cooked from frozen. My daughter asked if she can eat a PB&J instead of the pizza that was in front of her."}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza, half cheese, half hang ten. The girl on the phone said the pizza would be ready in ten minutes. Seemed a little hasty to me so I gave them 15 min since the place is around the corner from my house. As I was leaving I got a call from them saying they were closing in 5 min and I needed to come get my pizza. Now I understood why they were in such a rush. Needless to say all the veggies that come on the hang ten were piled on top of what looked like a previously ready cheese pizza. Cheese was melted but the veggies on top were cold and raw. Giving two stars only cause after I popped the pizza in my own broiler, it tasted fine."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Staff is friendly.  We were looking for a thin crust pizza with great taste and fresh ingredients. Beach Pizza has it all. The crust is crispy, the sauce is flavorful and the veggies are fresh. Prices are good and it is a gem."}
{"text":"*No one wears gloves here* I came here the evening of Friday Nov. 21, to get some pizza, fast. I asked the girl at the register How much a large cheese pizza is.  She said \"That'll be $12.92\". I asked how much 2 medium cheese pizzas are,  she said \"$12.95\". I ordered the two pizzas, paid, and said I'd be back. The girl at the register told me it would be 15-20 minutes.   I returned to a line of two people, less than 15 minutes later. I waited in the line for over 10 minutes, staring at my pizzas that were waiting on the shelf for me. As I was waiting, I watched an employee, a girl in a green apron, placing parchment in the box, where she was about to place the pizza, she pressed, with here bare hand, down on the middle of the paper, then placed a pizza someone was going to eat right on top. I looked at the other employees in the kitchen,  one was on the back of the oven, not gloved and another working in the kitchen, also not gloved. Of the four employees working there, zero wore gloves. When I got to the front of the line the girl asked what she could do for me. The restaurant wasn't that busy,  I feel like she should've remembered me. It was very irritating to wait in line for paid for pizzas. The pizza was average. None of us have the stomach flu yet."}
{"text":"Forget the nay sayers below, this place is amazing! I had excellent service. The place was very clean as well. I needed something quick to go, so I ordered a personal pizza with mushrooms and a side of ranch. The pizza crust was light and fluffy like a croissant. Sounds weird, but it's actually amazing! I've never had crust like this before. Very tasty. The rest of the pizza was delicious as well. And yes, it was cooked all of the way through. They also were not stingy on the mushrooms, which I appreciated very much. Last but not least, their ranch dressing was fabulous. It tastes like its homemade!   I'm a picky eater and I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I always enjoy Beach Pizza. The crust is good and the sauce is tangy. I like that I am able to buy pizza by the slice at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I honestly loved this place and their pizza but now they're closed on weds Thursday's???? Who the hell is closed mid week???? We like to order take out mid week when we're too busy to cook but this place has lost my business this is the third time they've been closed."}
{"text":"This meal was horrible. I ordered a calzone. The bottom was completely black - way overcooked. By the time it was delivered,  it was extremely tough. My husband ordered a philly.  He too was disappointed. We won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"We came because the other places we wanted were too busy or closed for repairs.  I got the lunch special.  Its a 1-topping personal pizza and drink for $3.99.  I would say this was a pretty good deal.  The pizza was a little bit more dough than pizza, but for 4 bucks I was full.  The cashier guy was really nice.  My daughter got the chicken fingers and an order of fries and this is why they only got 3 stars.  The fingers and fries are baked in the oven.  The fingers were pretty good.  You can get plain, hot and something else (I forgot).  The fries were burnt, which happens when you use an oven.  I tried to put lots of ranch on them but the burnt flavor was too overwhelming.  Also, the other reason they got 3 stars in because it was to-go and like many places they used styrofoam, which if holes aren't poked on the top, it make the fries super soggy.  So I had soggy burnt fries.  Which was no good.  I will still give it another shot, but will probably eat there."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. Decent decor. Small. Good value. We used Groupon coupon, but regular prices were still decent."}
{"text":"Came to Beach Pizza tonight for a fundraiser. We actually live by the M Resort so I was really hoping the drive was worth it. We were greeted right away and the staff were polite and friendly (not sure why so many negative reviews about the staff. They were nothing but polite to us) We even opted to eat outside because the weather was so nice and she boxed up our order and brought us plates, napkins, silverware, cheese, etc. to the outdoor table without us asking.  Pizza isn't on my diet, so tonight was a splurge/cheat day. We go to a mom & pop place out near us and we're pretty loyal to it. I just won't waste the calories in pizza if it comes from Pizza Hut or Papa Johns, you know? I was really happy with our pizza selection. We got a half and half and a medium sized order of wings. The boyfriend loves wings that are more on the crunchy then the chewy side - and these were, so he was a happy camper.  I love a good vegetarian pizza (even though I'm not a vegetarian) and this one was great. Sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms, lots of cheese, artichoke hearts and fresh garlic. The other half of our pizza was their version of a supreme pizza. (Photo is loaded in the photos section) I've gotta say - I'm pretty picky. The crust on this pizza was better then at my regular pizza place. So all in all, I was totally thrilled, I've told my friends, and I WILL be back."}
{"text":"We bought a Groupon a while back and decided to use it today. We got the Hang Ten pizza and mozzarella sticks.  It was okay. I meant to ask for the pizza without onions and green peppers but forgot. I realized my mistaked the second I got in my car and smelled the green peppers. However, I took the green peppers off and was pleasantly surprised to find that the taste didn't linger on the pizza and overwhelm everything else. I left the onions on as it was my wife who asked me to order without onions.  The pizza was just average. The crust was kind of soggy.  The mozzarella sticks were only lukewarm and did not taste homemade. They tasted like something you'd get from the freezer section of your local grocery store.  I might try it again, but I doubt I'll be a regular."}
{"text":"Star Rating: 2.5 because it is between \"Meh. I've experienced better\" and \"A-Ok\"  Long Winded Experience: I have been patronizing this establishment since I was in High School over ten years ago. Our favorite pizza of choice is the Buffalo Chicken Pizza. It's extremely delicious, but over the last ten years we have experienced lack-luster presentation and portions from Beach Pizza with this pizza specifically. They treat the chicken pieces like precious metals, sprinkling just a few bits here and there to add \"sparkle\" to what can only be called a Ranch/Cheese pizza, not a Buffalo Chicken Pizza. We've even asked, every time since the 2nd or 3rd time ordering it, for *extra* chicken. They go ahead and charge us $5 for extra chicken, but the pizza looks just like if you order it without extra chicken. It's completely disappointing and frustrating. The pizza is very delicious and a unique specialty pie, but is it worth $25 for an 18\" pizza that only has a smattering of Buffalo Chicken on it? I think not. Sorry, Beach Pizza. You have a wonderful concept, and a talented team to pull it off, but you skimp on toppings that make the pizza. My friends and I have eaten our last of Beach Pizza.   TL;DR: Delicious Specialty Pizza, but lacks sufficient \"Bang-for-your-buck\" in the toppings department for the price and \"Extra toppings\" vanish into thin air as you pay for them."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery through yelp, then got a call that the pricing was wrong, and my order was $10 more than it processed as. Then they weren't sure if they delivered to me, even though yelp makes sure before you order, and I had to wait while a few people talked it over in the background. I almost cancelled then. I wish I would have. Pizza can't really be bad, but it wasn't very good. I also got a burger and fries for my neighbor, and she was not imprssed either. Neither of us enjoyed our food, and even less since it wad more than we planned on. Won't order from them again."}
{"text":"Always great pizza/hoagies and service.  I order from here often to support a neighborhood business."}
{"text":"This place USED to be great. just called to place an order, they are closed. They shouldn't be closed....they decide when they are done. My family has been eating here for years. I grew up on this pizza. You guys are now disgraceful, shut down"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in a 5 mile radius. I come all the time, and love it. Popeye n olive oil, hang ten, blonde on the beach, pepperoni and garlic. I cant get enough!"}
{"text":"I normally do not like to write a bad review about a restaurant; however, I feel the need to warn people about this place.   I went to eat lunch at Beach Pizza yesterday and the service was good, but the restaurant was dirty and the food was awful. The pizza was not fully cooked and the dough was raw."}
{"text":"Bland and boring. We went there with a Groupon, spurred by comments on Yelp. I thought the almost non-existent sauce was out of a can. The toppings were meager. The crust was the best thing about it. We ordered sausage, mushroom, and black olives and onions. The black olives were ground up and looked like mouse droppings on the pizza.  I asked about the spices in the sausage and the counter person said the package only says spices. Fennel is the spice that gives Italian sausage some zip. Too bad they don't check out Aurelio's pizza. That has enough toppings and good taste."}
{"text":"My sweetie brought a \"hang ten \" pizza home from Beach Pizza.  I have to say,  that was a good pizza - mushrooms, olives,  onions, green pepper, pepperoni and sausage. The crust was thin (  but not super thin ) toppings were flavorful. I'll  definitely be up for some more pizza from this place.  A large pizza for about $18 . Not bad. Especially when it's this damn tasty."}
{"text":"We order every time we visit Vegas.  Everything we have tried was really good.  We always get the cheese, the blonde on the beach, a salad with mushrooms and olives, hot wings, and a veggie pizza.  They're not expensive and they use really good cheese and veggies.  We really wish there was a location in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"Stopped here as part of my Pizza Bender Tour 2011 Edition.  I live in the neighborhood, so it was only a matter of time before I gave it a try.  I was looking forward to have a couple of Slices of Pizza and was disappointed to find out they don't sell Pizza by the Slice.....Damn!  I wasn't going to let that stop me though.....so I ordered a Personal Sausage Pizza \"well done\" and a 1/2 Hot Italian Hero (Salami, Mortadella, Ham, Melted Mozzarella, Lettuce, Tomato, Italian Dressing, $4.75).  It took about 15-20 minutes for the food to be prepared.  I went for the Hero first....it was served Hot and the Cheese was melted throughout the Sandwich.  What was odd was the Tomatoes and Lettuce looked like Salad thrown on the Sandwich....it looked out of place and promptly \"fell\" out of the Sandwich when I took the first bite.  It was very tasty, but I didn't like how the Italian Dressing was served on the side like a dipping Sauce.  Just a weird setup, but plenty of potential....3.5 Stars on the Sammy. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tjHhb6lrJdOryY5Ao4pHOg?select=Iqzb-H48B0AgB0vX-tKhDg  Next I went for the Pizza.....I took one bite and thought it might have been a bust....but it grew on me.  The Crust is chewy and the Tomato Sauce has an interesting flavor.....all I can say is that I wanted more and that's always a good thing....for now, I'll give it 3 Stars. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tjHhb6lrJdOryY5Ao4pHOg?select=xHoP8sxg9hyWexhiY6x52A  The employees are really friendly too and I think it's family owned, which I love.  Overall, the joint gets 3 Stars and the Pizza will definitely get a 2nd try from me.  Return Factor - 80%"}
{"text":"Worst pasta ive ever experienced in my life. 20+ bucks and it was dried up pasta with tomato sauce. Garlic bread was decent so i gave it 2 stars."}
{"text":"We order Beach Pizza a couple of time a month. They have a great variety of pizzas you can order from the ordinary to the downright different. The crust is really chewy which I like. The place is super clean and the staff is friendly. This place is better than your average nuts and bots pizza joint."}
{"text":"Used to love this place.... last few times, we ordered with them, through eat.com, only to be told later, they were closed, they didn't get the order, N 2night..... eat.com called us 30 minutes after we ordered to cancel it bcuz no one was there..... super hungry n pissy now...  will not order from them again...booooo"}
{"text":"Fabulous Pizza... Friendly service & always ready when they say it will be. Their tomato sauce is unlike any other. Adds a very savory flavor. This pizza is so good I often order it just as a plain cheese pizza with thick crust. I have been one of their customers there for many many years. Worth the drive if you are outside of their delivery area. Usually ready in 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Horrible. Ordered  a chef salad and it was just lettuce topped with mozzerela cheese, turkey lunch meat that looked old, and a slice of american cheese, and chopped tomatoe.They cut it up in cute little triangles so presentation was attempted I guess. The pizza was very greasy ( cheese and pepperoni) and it tasted like pure tomatoe sauce. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Loved it! Vary friendly staff and great pizza. I gave it 5 stars because of the fast delivery and the cute driver:-)   she was tall and sexy,,,"}
{"text":"Wanted to try Beach Pizza, since it's closer than the place I usually go to, Roccos NY Pizza.  Large 3 item Pizza, chicken parm sub, and an order of buffalo wings.   The whole order of food, was sub-par, at best.  The buffalo wings, were terrible, smelled weird, oily, little wing sauce, ate a few, dumped the rest.  The Chicken Parm sub was mushy with too little chicken and too much sauce and cheese.  The pizza was kinda like Dominos, cardboardy crust, not the worst ever, but far from good.  For the prices, not a real good value.  For 1/2 the price, might be worth consideration for folks who usually order Pizza-Hut, Dominos, or Papa John's. Nice friendly staff and fast service, was the only bright spot.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Their site did not have the special on it, and we wanted to change our order to it, the employee would not let us."}
{"text":"This place used to offer not only quality pizza, but quality service as well. Unfortunately, the quality service has changed. My last visit, as I was walking out, pizza in hand, I overheard the two employees snicker about the size of tip I had left.  The quality of pizza has also sloped downhill. My most recent visits, I have encountered dough not cooked all the way through. Suffice it to say, I will be looking elsewhere for a good local pizza place to order from."}
{"text":"I used to love going here. I'd get their hot wings like once a week, every week and it was always made good and we had good service. After they went under new management or remodeled, the place turned to crap. They raised the prices of everything by ridiculous amounts. Not only that but they pick and choose who they want to deliver to. Nothing but careless teenagers now working there. What a shame, if they had stayed how they were, they'd be getting a 5 star review right now."}
{"text":"About ten years ago I searched for a Pizza place that taste like the ones we have in Michigan. And, we have our share of great pizza shops in the Mid West. I was told about Beach Pizza, went there, and have never been disappointed with their Pizza. It is my \"Special Treat\" when i need one. They are fast, friendly, and the price doesn't make you feel like you are back in California. Beach, I love your Pizza."}
{"text":"Beach Pizza was sold to a new owner 11/15 and was very good prior to that, the new name for this establishment Is called Beach ST Pizza and under new ownership"}
{"text":"The pizza is awesome if you like NY style. We always get a large so there are leftovers for lunch! Try the Hang Ten. They have nice fresh toppings and HUGE salads. I haven't tried the sandwiches, but I bet they are as good as the pizza. Today I cashed in the free dessert with check in and got the Chocolate Lover's Delight. Mmmmmm."}
{"text":"Friendly service, showed us the best offer to get more for less money. pizza was great. I have my found my new go-to pizza place."}
{"text":"Great pizza but DON'T order online! What a mess! They didn't have my order, charged me twice, very frustrating. They did refund one of the charges and comped me a 2 liter soda. But do yourself a favor and just call it in. :)"}
{"text":"We just ordered our food and had two edible items. The two bags of chips that accompanied our heroes. Meatball parm hero tasted like it had been frozen and thawed a few times. Definitely tasted spoiled and after two bites I threw it out. My husband had the eggplant parm hero and it was pretty much batter, cheese and sauce. The tiramisu was FROZEN!!!  Even if you order your desserts pre-made from Sysco, at least thaw the dang thing first. Not even worth calling back to fix it. Will not order from there again. Didn't try the pizza but no point in that now. Once you bite into spoiled food you're done."}
{"text":"Always on the look out for a good pizza and after reading the reviews on this place I decided to give it a whirl.   Being by myself tonight I ordered an Italian Sub. Damn good meat great bread and they toast the subs and put the veggies on cold! I love that.    Reading the reviews about the sauce I asked for a side and it was amazing. Great sweet tomatoes, some oregano some garlic, onions bazil and something I just couldnt place. If I had guess I would say honey.   I cant wait till I can talk the girls into giving the pizza a try."}
{"text":"Yet another review brought to you by Groupon.   I can never resist trying new places and when I have a coupon, I'm that much more motivated to check it out, even if it is in BFE (aka Summerlin).   This shop is small, but clean. Seems to be pretty well-maintained. The kid behind the counter was friendly and helpful when helping us out with our order. My fella and I ordered a medium pizza and medium wings (hot) to share. The restaurant was empty, but they had lots of delivery orders to take care of, so our food took a little bit of time, but they were still quite quick, despite the rush.  The pizza was tasty, nothing extraordinary, but definitely a nice thin pizza with a generous amount of cheese and sauce. The wings were pretty good. Spicy, but not intolerably hot. All in all, pretty good and  I definitely wouldn't object if I came here again, but given it's rather far location from my house, I think that's unlikely."}
