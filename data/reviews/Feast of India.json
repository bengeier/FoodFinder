{"text":"Great lunch buffet. Lots of veggie options. Clean place. Good price for quality food."}
{"text":"This was a very good buffet with quit a bit of selection.  The staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"My first time here . I had the lunch buffet. Good selection of dishes including Chana masala, mushroom matar, dal Makhni and matar paneer. On the non veg they had butter chicken, goat curry, fish curry and beef vindaloo. For desert they had gulag jamun and rice pudding aka kheer.
Located right on 52 street and 72  Ave Se , it hides behind the A&w drive thru. Good for those working in the area.
Ample free parking is available.
Ambience is good with a mix of Indian and outdoorsy decor.
Now let's get down to the food- matar mushroom , goat curry   Chana masala were delicious. naan was hot and fresh.
Butter chicken was too sweet. No effort was put in cooking the fish curry. It basically consisted of adding fish pakora to curry sauce and the same applies to kheer which tasted as if someone just combined steamed rice with milk and served it up.
Restaurant needs to put a bit more effort in their cooking!
Could easily fall down to 2 stars or go up to 4 stars of the cooking can be better.
Not sure if I will return for the lunch buffet as there are better choices available.
Try Harder!"}
{"text":"Finally tried an Indian cuisine after my come back to calgary in an entirely infamous location...This is located in SE. 
Wanted to give it 3.5 stars.
Placed an order over phone using a Groupon coupon. Ordered for aloo tikki (2.95 for two pieces)which was good but the sauce given as an add on should have been done much better . 

Also took two other vegetarian curries home and ate with paratha. As aloo tikki was not a hit, started tasting these two curries with a very low expectations.. Surprisingly these two curries are a way ahead in taste , yeah! I found another Indian cuisine restaurant with   a better taste. We asked for extra spicy and it was made so right.
Panner should have been more soft. Other than that there are no complaints about the taste.

Coming to the ambience of the restaurant, I would give it 2.5 stars. Not a place to admire but a place with tables and chairs , good to sit and eat, not very sure for dinner dates..

They do serve buffets . I think I read it right . It was $13.95. Looking forward to trying this one sometime later. 

The cashier at this restaurant sounded rude but we felt that may be because of his accent . 
If you happen to go by this location and looking for a taste of India then your bet would be Feast of India."}
{"text":"Don't go there on a Saturday.  Their hours on yelp say they are open on Saturdays, but they aren't."}
