{"text":"I ventured to Lola's this morning with my colleagues for a farewell brunch - it was delicious! I enjoyed the \"mini\" stuffed french toast - the berry compote was fresh (did not taste like a defrosted version) and the cheesecake filling was divine. My colleagues all ordered the scrambled egg dish and thumbs were up around the table. I sipped on tea, but others ordered the Americano coffee and said it was great. Overall, great spot for brunch!"}
{"text":"After reading a lot of the mixed reviews, I was very skeptical on bringing my mother here for a Sunday brunch. We arrived at around 10:40, and I was really nervous about seating, but there was no line up, and we were seated right away! The service was friendly, and attentive. I ordered the crepes, which was fantastic, and in my opinion tasted like having apple pie for breakfast! My mother also really enjoyed her breakfast. The food came almost fifteen minutes after we ordered, which was incredibly fast! It was perfect for a Sunday brunch, and I would recommend it to my friends!"}
{"text":"Finally, a restaurant that can accommodate my dietary needs and tastes amazing :D It's really hard to find a 100% Grass Fed Beef burger so when I saw it on the list, I went for it and was I pleased.  I went with the salad on the side. I would have preferred another dressing but it was still good. I ordered the cranberry and raspberry lemonade as well and it was perfect. Not too sweet and not too tangy. My boyfriend ordered the Lamb Burger with fries and he was extremely satisfied. It seems like a small meal but the flavours and the wholesomeness of it all does the trick. We were pretty good on just the meal but we decided to get dessert anyways. My boyfriend got the cupcake of the day which was a Coconut Cream Cupcake (Gluten free I believe) and I got the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake (Vegan/Gluten free). We're not used to vegan/gluten free dessert but wow, they were delicious. My boyfriend can't stop raving about the cupcake :P \"Best cupcake I've ever had!\" All in all, great restaurant, quick service and very informative on what's vegan/gluten free. It was fully packed on a Tuesday night so I'm assuming you would need to make a reservation for Friday/Saturday night. We're definitely coming back to try out other dishes, especially the brunch menu :D"}
{"text":"The menu is rather small.  Roasted walnuts salad I ordered was fresh and unusual. I'd recommend. But wouldn't recommend vanilla seed cheesecake ($7) it was very average, I didn't even finish.  Overall, I probably won't come back. The menu is too small for me."}
{"text":"This is my favourite brunch spot in the hood. They take reservations, even on the weekend, which is a definitely plus. It's amazing how busy they've become (it can be loud during peak times!!) - but given the good consistent food I'm not surprised! The service is a little *less* consistent, but not prohibitively so. I am still there at least twice a month.   The stuffed french toast is always fun - though consider getting a side order unless you're really hungry! I normally stick with the frittata (or the special if it excited me!) and a side of their homemade hot sauce :)  We've also tried their [newer] dinner menu which was great - including cheap pitchers of spiked watermelon lemonade."}
{"text":"It was my first time here, and I was very satisfied.  I had the pulled BBQ chicken sandwich, with a side of sweet potato chips.  A little bit messy to eat, but that's expected from a pulled meat saucy sandwich.  I would definitely come back next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I used to go here only for brunch, and it was delicious - especially their huevos rancheros (yum!!) - but I recently went there for lunch and was really impressed.  I had their California salad (Purple kale, quinoa or brown rice, avocado, sun dried tomatoes, toasted nuts + seeds, grilled organic tofu). The flavours were delicate yet distinct and I thought the portion size was perfect. I usually get a similar dish at Fresh but I find that they load up on the grains and don't use enough veggies.  This dish, however, was perfect! I was super satisfied and will definitely go for back for lunch, and will have to try dinner too!  The service is consistently great here; friendly, attentive and prompt.  Finally, the place itself is pretty cool; it's in a Victorian mansion with modern decor on the inside."}
{"text":"I had the mushroom benny, and it was just okay.  The whole thing was too sour from all the vinegar.  The mushrooms were over-cooked.  I love mushrooms, and I believe mushrooms should be cooked in a way that you can still taste the mushroom flavour, which was not the case here..  Fries were decent, but not awesome.  My bf lived in Bermuda, and he says it's really hard to find a real \"dark and stormy\", but he found it at Lola's, so that was a win, but it's not enough to get us to come back for the food."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Lots of great options. Went for brunch and had the eggs rancheros. Highly recommended. Can get a little loud in the restaurant and Sunday brunch is really busy!! Don't plan to go with more than 2 people."}
{"text":"Lola's Kitchen is a neighbourhood restaurant that is doing everything right. The food is amazing, the art, the tables aren't crammed together and the service is brilliant. The washroom is upstairs instead of in the basement, it's clean. Honestly, I can't think of anything bad to say!  The Summer kale salad made me a kale addict! The Kale Caesar is just as amazing!! I've taken clients there knowing that the food will be amazing and the service will match.   They have wonderful lemonades, cocktails and wine.   **If you go, call in for a reservation, they are busy...and for good reason!**"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for brunch, and the eggs benedicts that we've ordered was tasty.  The salad that came with my meal was a decent portion.  My friend had ordered house fries with her order instead of salad, but her fries tasted burnt. The staff was happy to replace the fries for her, but the second batch was less burnt but still mediocre.   Food aside, the staff were friendly, and the ambience was nice (they have really nice art decor)."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday, as Salad House was closed (this was where I had originally planned to go). There were so many good reviews for Lola's that I was happy with the change in plans. We were seated fairly quickly, given that it was a busy Saturday. Our server was very efficient not at all pushy (I appreciated that). Our food arrived quite quickly as well. It was very delicious. I ordered Lola's Breakfast and my friend ordered the Eggs Rancheros. Everything tasted fresh and of high quality. I was also appreciative of the gluten-free options, as I seem to be allergic to wheat. The decor and atmosphere was also impressive, as it doesn't look like much on the outside. I would highly recommend Lola's for the professional service and excellent food."}
{"text":"Giving it a pass...but I'm willing to try it again for brunch.  Went a while ago for a friend's bday. I like how they offer a selection of cocktails in pitchers...until they come to your table, and you see how small they are (I guess we all expected beer-sized pitchers). Food was pretty bland. Boring ambiance."}
{"text":"Had veggielicious.   Overall I love their food.  Their soup and drink inspired me  how to use spices to make simple dishes different.   I was impressed with butternut squash spike with cumin.  The berries ginger lime was awesome.  Little disappointed with the apple cinnamon cranberry as it was too sweet.  But I could tell the chef has passion about food from the dishes she deserved.  Good service!"}
{"text":"The place doesn't have a multitude of options so you'd think that they know what they do but it took them more then 30 minutes to make a sandwich  (without meat) & the only pasta dish they had. The food itself was good but if you expect a nice atmosphere you'd be surprised that a nice looking place like that plays shitty top 40 stupid rap music. Definitely will go to other places where food served faster & music is slightly more sofisticated"}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times. The food has always been amazing. I've tried the curried chickpea and almond burger, Santa Fe bowl, and black bean burger. They are all amazing and really flavourful. My favourite is the black bean burger - with guacamole, salsa and a yummy black bean patty.   The place is quite nice but pretty small. There's not a lot of space so it's hard to sit comfortably. The service is pretty decent- had good servers in the past and have had a few terrible servers here as well.   For weekday lunch it's best to make reservations otherwise you'll end up waiting for a few hours."}
{"text":"Lola's Kitchen now pops up on my internal message board when someone asks me: Do you know any great places to have brunch? Yes!  What's not to love?  Great food:  -Their menu offers fresh and multi-faceted brunch fare that is both simple and creative. There are a dozen possibilities with vegetarian and healthy options so you don't need to envision your arteries clogging. I ordered the frittata with a side salad and sampled my bud's eggs benny on whole wheat organic biscuits. The frittata came perfectly firm with lots of veggies and mushrooms inside, with a hearty sprinkling of warm goat cheese and garnish greens. The eggs benny were  warm and firmly poached, resting on delicious brown biscuits.  I love me some Cora's but I will take Lola's over them any day when it comes to options for my eggs. But that's not all that makes this place great...  Great service: -We had a big group of ten and they accommodated our size and multiple orders with ease. Our server was attentive and not only friendly but humourous.   Great ambiance and interior art -It's located in an old house with fifteen foot ceilings and gorgeously large windows, perfect for letting in the brunchey-morning light. Unpretentious but artsy, there is real art for sale on the walls and colourful murals in the main rooms and in the washrooms upstairs. Right now the art is nicely modern bold colour silhouette images (via silkscreen, I'd wager)  Great location:  -Close to Bloor subway and a pleasant 15 minute walk from Wellesly through the Village.   Definitely one of my fave brunch places right now."}
{"text":"Had a mixed experience going here for brunch. The ambiance, service, and coffee was really great. We were greeted rapidly, got a great table, were given water, and drink orders were taken all within minutes.  However, the food was less stellar than I hoped. The cheescake French toast, plated beautifully, although great for the first bite, soon became a huge chore to eat as it was HUGELY sweet. Everything in the dish (French toast, cheesecake, and compote) was exceptionally sweet and there was no respite. I could barely finish it and that was not due to being full. it was much sweeter than most cheesecakes I have eaten.   The Eggs Lola suffered from bland salsa, and was served on a tortilla that was not grilled (and did not seem to be made at the restaurant, although could be wrong on that), so it came off tasting a bit bland and pre-fab overall. The pulled chicken in it was very nice, though.  So in summary, I think with a little more care the food could get to the next level, just by tweaking the ingredients they are already using, and applying the taste test a bit more. I really like this place and want it to do well."}
{"text":"We ordered the Bloor St. Bowl and the roasted salmon with polenta and fennel.  The portions were ridiculously small considering the prices and the flavour was lacking. Polenta was soggy and too big, to overcompensate for the fact that the salmon was a very small piece. The salad was mostly spinach. Hardly any dressing.  Overall, very unsatisfying."}
{"text":"We ate here on 9/1/2012. The service was great even when they were slammed.  Our server was funny and personable.  I ordered a lamb burger and soup.  The burger was cooked perfect and the feta on top made it even better.  My wife had the grilled cheese and potatoes, and she was amazed also.   They had a great outdoor area.  The atmosphere was great.  Make sure you go here, just remember parking is hard to find unless you walk a couple of blocks to the parking garage."}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious. Had the quinoa risotto, wonderful complex flavours. Been here two times for work outings and would go many more times."}
{"text":"Solid brunch place in a Saturday or Sunday morning. I've been here twice and I've enjoyed it. I've had no problem getting a table even though I've heard there could be a wait. I got the mushroom Benny both times and it was great. The service and ambience was good too. It's nice to have a nice brunch place close to home. Definitely recommend Lola's kitchen"}
{"text":"Visited this resto for the first time last Thursday.  It's a cozy atmospher, and the food is delicious and fresh.  Since both my date and I are vegetarian, we asked if any substitution would be made for the pasta of the day, which included chicken.  Instead, they included tonnes of everything else (arugula, olives, tomatoes, etc.), which was perfect and yummy.   The server was friendly and helpful, although it took us by surprise when she came by asking for payment when we not yet ready to leave.  Maybe she just wanted to get the dull stuff out of the way...?  I'm not sure, but it was still a lovely night.  The only other small issue is that we had to ask for our waters to be refilled, but again, not a big deal.  Will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Like this place but I am extremely disappointed with their new menu. No tacos??? It seems that the menu keeps shrinking. Not impressed."}
{"text":"I went for lunch, and the grilled cheese with caramelized onions and pear was really great! Very good service and reasonably priced. Will return for brunch!"}
{"text":"This one of my favourite brunch spots. The vibe is relaxed, the servers know what they are talking about and while they cater to glutards and vegans Lola's Kitchen doesn't neglect the carnivores among us.  Love this place. Can't wait for patio season when I can have a Brunch bowl and a mimosa outside in the sunshine."}
{"text":"So much potential. My partner is vegan and its wonderful to think we could have an option which would satisfy both of us.     Unfortunately, Lola's is very inconsistent. Today the home fries were not cooked thoroughly and the eggs Benny were cold.     The the lack of stellar food doesn't seem to deter the long lineups to get in. I wish the neighborhood had more options to keep everyone on their toes.    It wasn't the birthday brunch of my dreams."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out because of the reviews on Yelp. This place is great because they have something for myself, who is a vegan, and my partner, who only eats meat. This kind of a restaurant is really rare. I ordered the burger made with black bean and walnuts (so delicious!) and my partner ordered the meat burger. She said she would even come back just for the fries alone. My burger came with sweet potato chips and we were both soooo happy with our meals. We weren't even finished with our meal and we were already planning for our next visit."}
{"text":"After reading about their cheesecake stuffed french toast, I knew I had to make a visit to Lola's.  Lola's specializes in lunch and brunch so they're only open until 3pm everyday. I had some trouble deciding what to order but once the server informed us that one of the day's specials was an eggs benny on top of a grilled cheese, I was sold.  I love eggs benny and I love grilled cheese, so this was an easy choice. This Grilled Cheese Eggs Benny came with poached eggs and spinach covered with hollandaise all on top of a Challah-bread grilled cheese sandwich.   The grilled cheese itself was amazing. The cheese blend was perfect and the sandwich wasn't too greasy - I hate it when restaurants serve up a soggy pile of grease. As for the eggs benny portion of the dish, the eggs were perfectly poached and the hollandaise, while good, wasn't great. I should have just gone with the plain grilled cheese instead.  Most of their dishes are served with your choice of soup, salad, frites or Lola's Potatoes. I went with Lola's Potatoes, thinking they must be good if they're named after the restaurant. It consisted of mostly sweet potatoes with some regular potatoes thrown into the mix and contained a blend of Indian spices (garam masala). I wasn't a huge fan of them as I prefer my potatoes crispier.  Now, onto what we came for: Lola's Stuffed French Toast - Challah French toast stuffed with homemade vanilla cheesecake topped with a seasonal fruit compote ($12). Today's seasonal fruit compote was nectarine, which was surprisingly nice. It was actually my favourite part of the dish. I found the French toast to be a tad on the dry side, but the compote certainly helped. The cheesecake filling was decent but I would've preferred it to be a creamier filling. Overall, I thought it was good...but I expected it to be a lot better since it sounded so epic."}
{"text":"I feel bittersweet writing this review. On one hand, the food at Lola's is superb (one of the best restaurants in the city that actually offers healthy options that aren't strictly vegetarian or vegan based - we need more restaurants like Lola's in Toronto). However, the staff and service are quite another affair that left a bad impression on us...  We've been regulars for over a year now but lately, it seems some of the staff are more concerned about closing up as early as possible than actually serving customers. Their website (and Yelp profile) notes they close at 10PM on a Friday, however they've been closed an hour early for the past 3-4 months now. One time, we called to double check and they said that the kitchen would close at 9:30PM that night. We arrive at 9 only for one of the servers to tell us she wouldn't seat us because they were closed. I understand if business is slow but here's an idea if you've noticed a pattern of being slow on a certain day/time: change your hours of operation!   We are reluctant to return now since we are afraid to be turned back again. A real shame since the food is amazing."}
{"text":"This spot may very well have one of the best resto names in the city: Lola's Commissary (heretofore known as \"LC\"). Luckily for those Torontonians who consider brunch a sport, they also have one of the best brunches I've ever had.  Thanksbeto the TTC, it took nearly an hour to get there (!), so I had plenty of time to work up an appetite. Just north of Charles Street, LC is located in a small strip of restos and shops along Church Street. It's open, airy and inviting ( especially on days that are so cold that you almost fall down from numb legs). There are large windows that allow tons of light to stream in. I was happily greeted straight away.   The brunch menu had several choices, including mushroom risotto, nutella/banana/white chocolate chip French toast (um, yes please!), and, my choice, salsa poached eggs. They also have a \"regular\" menu from which to order brunch that looked equally delish. The only downfall to the specials is that they aren't served with the \"sexy potatoes\", which I really wanted to try, but for which I really didn't want to pay an extra $6.      Long time readers of my Yelp reviews know that when I brunch, I like to order a little \"something sweet\", usually in the form of a single pancake or piece of french toast. In all the places I've eaten in T.O., I've never been told that I couldn't be accommodated. Until today. I asked if they would do a single piece of French toast, or at least a half order, but was told they \"don't do that here\". Not a huge deal and I respect that, but how hard is it to fix just one piece of toast instead of two? Anyway.  On to the crowning glory: the eggs! The salsa poached eggs were wicked, wicked good. I nearly cried, they were so good! In fact, I haven't had \"Mexican\"-style eggs this good since I left Texas. Perfectly flavored, they had an appropriate amount of heat and spice. Served in a very hot bowl (!) with avocado slices, black beans, and delicious homemade tortilla chips on the side, the eggs had the perfect amount of \"run\" to them. The spicy tomato broth that the eggs were served in was seriously tasty.    Service was quick and attentive. My bill came to $21 with tip, which I think is a little high for a cup of tea and a poached egg, but price notwithstanding, LC is a definite must-stop spot on the TO brunch circuit. Run, don't walk, and eat there! Hurry!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for brunch and really enjoyed it.  It's a cosy restaurant, probably best for small groups/pairs.  The food is fantastic (I recommend the huevos rancheros) and very vegetarian friendly.  The servers have been great, I never had to wait long for a coffee refill.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Loved the casual and bright ambiance. It's perfect for a brunch date on the patio! It seemed to seat quite a number of people both inside and outside.  I enjoyed my mushroom benedict very much! The waitress made sure that my coffee was being regularly refilled. My friend got the mimosa which is a daily special on Saturdays and looked delicious! I'll be getting it next time."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for brunch on the weekend. We asked for a table on the patio. The first table we sat at was very wobbly and could barely hold our water glasses without falling over. So we asked to move to another available table. The waitress agreed but was not too keen to assist. Then the the other table we were moved to had milk spilled all over the floor underneath it. We asked for the milk to be cleaned, but to our surprise, she simply refused. She said they will clean it at the end of the day, but it was literally a huge puddle of milk and we couldn't sit without both our shoes getting soaked in it. Disappointed, my husband took some napkins and cleaned it himself so we could eat our meal in a somewhat clean space.   My husband ordered one of the menu items with egg whites only and he was told that they couldn't accommodate, which was another disappointment.  Terrible service but it's a shame because we live down the street from Lola's and used to enjoy their food, and will  not be returning for another terrible experience."}
{"text":"I was looking for a cute brunch spot near Yonge/Bloor and Yelp brought me to Lola's! It's a very cute restaurant located a block south of Bloor on Church St - very close to Yonge station. The restaurant is in an old large house, and is beautifully decorated with bright colourful paintings. It was busy around 12:30, but we had no problem getting a table for two.   The servers were all very friendly and came to ask for drink orders right away (note: they also offered soy milk for my coffee, which was nice!). Our orders were also brought out quite quickly despite being very busy.   I had the egg white fritata ($1 extra for egg whites), which comes with spinach, mushrooms, pesto and goat cheese, and a green salad. It was amazingly flavourful, and the eggs were nice and soft, not too crispy on the bottom or edges. My friend had the BLT whole wheat wrap with thin-cut french fries. We both really enjoyed our meals. The menu has a variety of breakfast foods (french toast, eggs benny) and a few lunch items, mainly wraps. My meal came to about $20 with tax and tip.   I would definitely recommend, and will likely return in the summer - they have a large front patio, which looks nice."}
{"text":"We walked into a dead dining hall at 7:30 on a Wednesday night and I felt a little pang of apprehension. The decor is simple and lovely, the lighting soft, and the seasonal tapas menu makes it look like a welcome addition to the Church St. dining scene.  The menu is quite tasty-sounding but the tapas dishes look a little on the expensivo side. $8 for one ravioli? Not in this hood, darlin'. We went with the larger sharing plates and settled on a Spanish tortilla, Ponzu noodles with tofu, and frites with garlicky mayo.   The tortilla was a bit of a disappointment. It was cooked well but was somewhat tasteless. A heavier hand with the tomato topping might have helped. The Ponzu noods, however, were delicious. A bowlful of steamy tamari broth and chewy udon was perfect for that foggy autumn eve. The frites were another miss. Kinda soggy and lukewarm with nary a hint of the promised garlic-ness in the mayo.  I love the location and my mouth drools when I read their menu but I remain unconvinced. I think I'll venture out for brunch next time and indulge in some second chances. Come on, Lola's, make it work!"}
{"text":"I just got paid, and because I have poor money management skills I had to go and blow it on a $25 lunch. I know what you guys are thinking - get to the damn review. So for all you impatient people out there I will get straight to business.  I went around 12:45pm and it was rammed. Judging from all the hipster haircuts, ray ban sunglasses, and the vegan, grass feed, sun bathed, gluten free choices I think it is safe to assume that everybody cares about their health....lol, not me. I yolo every chance I get to eat.   So I ordered the salmon sandwich with a side of thinly sliced fries. I specifically ordered this because it had bacon and it wasn't gluten free. I don't even know what gluten free is - but all I know is if I am paying full price on my sandwich in the hood  you want everything, even the crap that fell on the floor. Same logic applies downtown.  The sandwich tasted good it had good flavors the avocado was nice, and the salmon was nice and fresh. My only and biggest draw back is the bread. Let me try to make you guys understand what was going on, the bread was a brown/rye bread...  it was like the ends of the fork digging into your gums and cutting your mouth cause the bread is too damn hard when they toast it! Maybe some people like that but not me, we don't got dental insurance in the hood...that $25 lunch could turn into a $900 dentist appointment real quick. So folks at Lola's lightly toast your bread.  With that being said our waiter was really nice. I will give it a 4/5 stars only because the bread was a nightmare - 50 shades of grey type of nightmare."}
{"text":"The best brunch place in the city. If you have any allergies or are gluten free this is the place to go!   Oh and the polenta fries are the best!  Yum! A great alternative to regular fries!   They have yummy Caesar that are great for \"hair of the dog\" mornings.   Love this place. Would highly recommend. :)"}
{"text":"I've lived within a 5 minute walk from Lola's for quite some time, but only just tried the brunch.   The servers were all quite friendly and the ambiance is quite relaxing.  The interior of the building is very nice, and the patio in front is enjoyable on a sunny summer day.  Unfortunately, these aren't the reasons we go out for brunch.  My partner and I each ordered the Eggs Benny.  Not only did we not enjoy the meal, but we left feeling quite sick from it.  The sweet potatoes were the worst I've ever had .  They were slightly undercooked, soaked in oil, and had no seasoning on them.  The garlic aioli and chipotle dips ($1 extra, apparently) were oddly both bland as well and only seemed to make the dish worse.  The eggs were cooked perfectly, the peameal was crunchy, the bread not toasted enough, and the hollandaise too tangy and full of chives.  I'd give this place another chance for drinks, but that's all.  Up until now, I've never actually had a hard time finishing a $20 brunch before."}
{"text":"Super duper delicious! Lots of vegetarian options, fresh and local ingredients, a great atmosphere, and really friendly service! Try one of their fresh juices, I had the spiced apple lemonade and it tasted comforting and refreshing at the same time. I also had the spiced butternut squash cake for dessert and it had a very wonderful compote. It was truly a great (and filling) meal!"}
{"text":"3.5/5! Refreshing change- very healthy options! Recommend the kale brunch salad!!"}
{"text":"While I was a little confused with the outside menu refering to tapas. sharing plates, side plates etc but when I chose a Fixe Price menu (which was not listed outside) for $25,00 I found that this was very adequate & affordable. (However you must take into account that I am into quality rather than quantity sort of guy) . Service was very good, atmosphere a little cool but I am sure that will improve in time. They have a Sunday Brunch and take Reservations, so will try that shortly and report back. One block from the South (Hayter St) exit from Yonge/Bloor Subay Station."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. Once for brunch and the other time for dinner. I love how they have gluten free, vegan and veggitarian options. They are very accommodating and the service was excellent. Our server came by to check up on us frequently. I like the fact that they dropped off a bottle of water so we could pour it ourselves. For dinner I had the beef burger and instead of a bun I had it substituted with a portobello mushroom with their frites. It was so tasty and the burger was cooked perfectly. Their frites are so good, I would definitely recommend getting it.   I really like this place and will gladly go back to try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"First time here for lunch.  Nice patio area with enough patio umbrella in the patio area.  Inside decor cozy and comfortable.  I order their California Bowl with quinoa and grilled tofu.  You could choose from quinoa or brown rice or substitute the grilled tofu with chicken for extra $2.  But I personally love grilled tofu.  Also order the or blackberry, (something), ginger + lime juice.  It was so refreshing and very tasty. :p.  My friend ordered the ribs and frites.  Their ribs are fall off the bone tender.  Very nicely done, their frites are frites.  Hahaa. Can't go wrong with these thinly cut perfectly fried potato goodies.    Overall I love my first experience at Lola  food are excellent and the ambience are very comfortable.   Too bad I didn't take any photos cause I was too Hungry I devour the whole dish before I remember I need to feed my camera.  :p  I would defiantly come back again to try out their brunch."}
{"text":"Sweet atmosphere and the Eggs Rancheros were off the hook.   Toronto needs more Mexican like breakfast. You see this everywhere in San Francisco or San Diego.   NOTE: The coffee was exceptionally great. I had 3 cups :)  The waitress was very polite and friendly with great attire :)"}
{"text":"Lola's Kitchen is a cozy spot in an old brick house, nestled on Church just south of Bloor. My boyfriend and I live in the area and can often be found perched on their patio after a night of drinking, brunch bevs in hand.  Speaking of brunch, it's our favourite restaurant in the city. If you're looking for healthy options or if you have dietary restrictions, this is the place for you. Their entire brunch menu can be made gluten free, and if anything isn't marked vegetarian or vegan, just ask the friendly staff to sort you out. They serve up mimosas with freshly-squeezed orange juice and spicy caesars at a decent price. Brunch is offered until 4pm, so be as tardy as you want.  The servers are fantastic, by the way. They tend to your needs without getting up in your face and saying \"How is everything taaaaaasting?\" (Does anyone else find that question super awkward?)  Stop in for dinner and partake in their tacos, topped with tangy pico de gallo and guac   and priced at $3.75 each. Then fill up on a hearty quinoa bowl or a black bean burger.  And don't leave this place without trying Lola's Potatoes, which are slightly curried and spiced to perfection. If you're on a diet, at least steal one or three from your friend's plate. I promise I won't tell your crossfit trainer or whatever."}
{"text":"Highs and lows. Lows: dirty cups, poor service and overpriced, bad patio tables. Highs: wholesome, gluten-free fresh, tasty brunch food. Ok, decent casear."}
{"text":"I've been to Lola's twice and I have to say that I've been very impressed both times. I've sat inside and on the patio - both are a wonderful setting for brunch.  Obviously the first thing everyone has to mention is the french toast stuffed with cheesecake. I've never ordered the whole thing to myself, but I've tasted it and it's exactly as good as it sounds.  The last time I was there I had the Ancho Chicken wrap and it was delicious. I love fresh avocado with chicken and the sexy potatoes on the side complimented it well.  The service is always great and the vibe is very laid-back and welcoming. It feels like a place where you could easily become a regular."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try Lola's after one of his friends recommended it to us. We got there around noon on a Saturday and were starving for some brunch. The place was packed, and since it wasn't the nicest day out, they lost the tables that they could have had open on the patio. The wait was about 15-20 minutes, which was fine. We were seated in the back room on the main floor. We didn't feel crowded, even though the restaurant was packed, so that was nice.   Our waiter was really friendly and was quick to bring us water and take our order. I went with the Lola's Breakfast, with frites (I'm not a huge homefries fan). It took a while for our order to arrive, but the place was packed and it was brunch, so we understand.   When our meals came, they were nice and hot. The server was quick to grab me some jam after I requested some, and we dug in. The eggs were pretty standard, the bacon was a little too greasy (in fact I only ate one of the two pieces as it was just too much grease). The toast was a great multigrain bread. Really delicious and fresh. And their frites.. I am so happy I got frites. SO good.   We'd definitely come back. I'd love to try their lunch/dinner menu. I see they have pulled pork and I do love pulled pork."}
{"text":"Great restaurant , the chicken is incredible ! I highly recommend this place for anyone who is trying to watch their waist line but still enjoy a night out with friends."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome!  I really, really liked it so I came back, several times a week for months.  I came with friends, I came with dates...But...., after a few visits, I noticed that the staff wiped the tables in a circular fashion and left the corners of the square table.  My hand stuck to it and I noticed that the tables corners were black and gunky looking.  So I asked the wait staff to wipe the table better.  He seemed offended at the request.  He and the other wait staff had a little tete a tete about it.  Really? So the next time I go to Lola's kitchen, I check the corners of the table.  I don't even want to touch it and I wait for the staff to wipe it before I sit down  because of this spot that appeared on my hand after I touched the black, gunky stuff on the last table.  So, there is an obvious splotch that is still shiny and a splatter trail on the corner of the table!!  I ask the wait staff to wipe the table. Her first reaction was to immediately deny the splotch.  (yes, I remember you all grumbling because I asked you to do your job last time) I point to it. She shuts up and gets a rag to wipe the table properly!  The spot on my hand gets bigger and I am advised by a nurse to go to the hospital.  I do.  It's only a boil but.....I HAVE NEVER HAD A BIOL IN MY WHOLE LIFE BEFORE AND I AM OVER 50!!!!    Ok, one boil, not so bad, right?  Well since then I have had 6 boils, that's SIX, on my hands since that day.  I decided that after three, if I got one more, that I would call the health inspector.  I did.  And this is what Lola's said, (you're gonna love this)   1) \"the veneer is wearing off.\"  FYI, when veneer wears off, it doesn't get black and gunky, what happens is -you start to see the wood!!!  REally!!?! 2)\"we were planning to re varnish the tables\"  When?  After I complained last year about the nastiness of your place. Ewww! Now I have to pay for independent testing to find out what bacteria i picked up from those filthy tables. And I am going to have to pay to rid myself of this filthy bacteria that has clearly made itself home in my skin.  Was this food worth the hundreds of dollars this will cost me to correct?  No way.  One star for excellent food. One star for Amanda Seyfried sighting."}
{"text":"Its so close to home and we end up their most weekends - but i have the same thing everytime so i couldnt tell you what else to try there :) but the eggs bennies - fantastic! Their roasted potatoes are great too.  Its a cute neighbourhood brunch place - lots of character and warmth. The service is great - the staff is very friendly. It gets very crowded on the weekends so it'll be a bit of a wait but well worth it. They have a cute little patio on the outside too.  I hear they're starting dinner service too?!?"}
{"text":"Decided to eat here as we were looking for a \"healthy\" dinner option in the area.  I ordered the highly recommended California bowl with quinoa.  It was a good portion size (filling enough and I ate nearly all of it before getting tired of the flavours).  It wasn't too salty either. Though it was good, I didn't feel super satisfied with my meal. I wouldn't say it's the best bowl I've had nor the worst! My fiancé had the braised chicken. It was also good, but nothing special. I think if you are looking for a nutritious restaurant meal, this place has good menu options and prices. The ingredients were fresh too. The service was really really good. I'd say the food was a 3 and the service was a 4!"}
{"text":"The lineups for brunch is usually always insane. It's by far the only decent brunch place in the area.   Their homemade hot sauce is amazing! Although I notice recently they've started to water it down which is disappointing considering they charge you a $1 for it it. Also the portions are pretty decently sized.. the caesar kale salad is one of the best I've had in the city.  My only complaint is that sometimes when they're under-staffed the food is a disaster.. Who serves burnt home fries?!"}
{"text":"Best Gluten Free Burger and fries we've ever had!! Fast service & friendly. Delicious."}
{"text":"We go here once a week because it's so close to work. Amazing food and decent prices. Highly recommend the kale Caesar - the kale is not chewy and difficult to eat, so crunchy and yummy and creamy. Also recommend the shrimp taco, grilled cheese or California bowl."}
{"text":"The salad was fresh, healthy and the portion was big enough for 2 people. Strongly recommend it"}
{"text":"Gonna have to dig deep to find a complaint, oh yeah, apparently the bathrooms on the second floor were cold said my co-eating companion. That's it. Everything else...fabulous.The hostess greeted us very quickly, even being 3rd in line (about 2pm, on a Sunday) and the place was full but not 'packed'. Most surprisingly, we were seated ahead of those in front of us (we were a party of 2, larger parties in front of us). Very nice. That set the tone for a very enjoyable Sunday 'brunch'. A delightful menu with a variety of brunch 'staples' but with a bit of originality. For example, they had a French Toast packed with CHEESECAKE (didn't try it as the last one was ordered right before us, boo, will have to go back), and a nice twist to the regular 'benny' which I believe they called the \"Savannah\", which was a polenta based benny with spiced shrimp. I also felt like if I didn't want some variation of egg, there were 4-5 other items (at least) that would do the trick. There was also what seemed to be a separate 'specials' menu that I ordered from, a take on a corn beef hashwhich was nicely cooked. Tender beef, a nice mild bbq sauce, well cooked eggs and properly cooked homestyle potatoes mixed in. Food came at a good pace and the staff were quite intuitive; we rarely had to ask for anything. Although we were relatively full from our meals, we couldn't resist sharing a very delicious Bourbon Caramel Torte in a Shortbread crust for dessert which I was told was homemade! Pricewise, well, considering we had 2 Mimosas each with our meal, I can't complain greatly about the price which was more 'lunch' than a 'brunch' if you follow my meaning. The service was attentive but not pushy, we were not packed in like Sardines, and the food didn't disappoint. I'm definitely going to head back soon and would recommend this to others. My guess is get there early or late (as we did) as a place like this may leave you with a bit of a wait in line during peak Sunday brunch hours. Great find!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times, twice this past week. Once for brunch on Sunday which was a great experience with good food, good service and an overall enjoyable experience. On another visit today for lunch we ordered an appetizer and two mains. One of the mains had a hair in the fries. Literally wrapped around one. I brought it up to the waiter and was asked what he should do. I kept the main and the fries were replaced with no apology given. Once the bill came I was expecting some sort of reduced charge or the meal taken off altogether as is common place in response to a hair in your meal. There was not and when I brought it up the waiter he was rude and tried to convince me it was ok. He then stormed off to the manager and did not return to our table. The manager took $5 off our bill which is more like a consolation prize then the restaurant taken ownership for its mistake. I have never seen this situation handled so poorly and will not be returning or recommending Lola's going forward."}
{"text":"Had lunch. Friendly service and healthy choices on the menu. Satisfied with my smoked salmon sandwich. You can substitute fries with salad.  One thing I highly recommend is their fresh cranberry lemonade. Very refreshing and not too sweet and it is yummy!"}
{"text":"I went here for brunch recently with my girlfriend (Celiac, so she requires her food to be gluten free). The staff here were very helpful in answering our questions making sure that everything was indeed gluten free and that the fryer used to make Lola's signature homefries was gluten free as well. I ordered the Eggs Benny (not gluten free), she ordered the Crepes (gluten free and vegan), and we both shared a side order of Lola's homefries and smoked bacon between us. The Eggs Benny was delicious, the crepes were a bit heavy for my girlfriend's liking. This was probably due to the mix of gluten free flours that they used. The side of homefries and bacon was delicious as well. Since my girlfriend requires her food to be gluten free it's been a while since she's had homefries made in a fryer so that was definitely a treat for her.   In terms of the service the wait time to get seated and for our food was fairly quick. We went at about 11am for Sunday and only had to wait 5 minutes for a table.  Overall, this place definitely exceeded expectations. Would highly recommend for anyone that has an intolerance to gluten."}
{"text":"We waited thirty minutes for a table when the hostess estimated ten, the eggs were extremely overcooked (which we waited 45 minutes for), and bad customer service on top of that. I would absolutely not return, and I live right around the corner."}
{"text":"This is really the nicest spot for lunch in the Y&B area. a Lunch wrap with side of potatoes, fries, or salad runs for $14 with tax and tip.  A wrap doesn't sound substantial but I have never finished my entire meal.  Best offerings are the crispy tofu wrap or the wild mushroom and goat cheese wrap with the salad (fennel!). There are two chicken options as well, that I can recall and pastas, salads, pizzas etc.   Glanced at the specials as I was leaving, Tuesday has an eggs Bene for $8, Thursday has a wrap and gazpacho for $8, Wed has a meat and veggie pizza for $8 each.   Wide selection of health conscious, vegan, veggie etc options and alot of high quality, inspired and simple food. beautiful decor and pleasant waitstaff, perfect for lunch with friends or business meetings. Always in and out within the hour.  I have only been for lunch, not dinner or brunch but I hear everything is fabulous across the board.   I would give five stars except for one complaint. The last Two times I dined here were both Thursdays and both times I had the wrap with a side, which is $11. I later noticed that Thursday has a wrap special with a soup. I would have liked the server to mention the special when I had ordered a wrap, but she didn't either time.   Really, the highest quality food in this neighborhood for a healthy sit-down lunch. Nice patio and they take all methods of payment."}
{"text":"I have never had a black bean burger so flavourable without overpowered by salt before. This totally tops the curried chickpea almond burger ordered by my son. We also love their Kale Caesar Salad which was tasty and crunchy. Definitely a repeat for me!"}
{"text":"We came for brunch on a Saturday morning and the staff is attentive and polite! The wait was only 15 mins and as soon as the table is available, the staff came and invited us in.  Food was great with a nice ambience, I like the brunch bowl in particular! Would definitely come visit again!"}
{"text":"I liked the brunch bowl. Huevos rancheros was good as well my friend mentioned. Good potatoes and coffee."}
{"text":"I went for lunch mid afternoon. The restaurant itself is clean and trendy looking. Our server, Lauren, was great. She was attentive and every time I needed her it seemed like she was paying attention. I don't know what the service would be like at a busier time, but I was impressed and happy.  I was satisfied with the menu options and our food came out pretty fast. I had the vegan tacos, veggie burger (regular), and espresso cheese cake. Vegan, Gluten Free and Vegetarian options are clearly marked on the menu. The cheese cake is the same Sweets from the Earth type you can get at any vegan friendly restaurant in the city. The tacos were good, but they were presented in such a way that I could not pick them up without a bunch of the contents falling out which was a minor annoyance. They were laying on their side, and the side closest to the plate was shorter than the side facing up so the food was already not tucked completely inside. I don't know, maybe I'm just not a skillful taco eater. Veggie burger was good. The fries are awesome- they were the perfect amount of crispy. We didn't have any alcoholic beverages, but I was looking at the menu and it seems like they have plenty of options.  I would definitely like to come again and try their brunch menu."}
{"text":"Had a tough time deciding what to order as everything sounded delicious (and many dishes could be adapted to be vegan and/or vegetarian), but I settled on the mushroom benny with goat cheese. The herbed hollandaise was delish and my eggs were cooked perfectly. I paid a few extra bucks for the goat cheese, which I hardly noticed, so that wasn't worth the extra cost. Their coffee is excellent. Service was slow, but there was only one server managing a large number of tables and she was doing her best, so we were patient. Everyone in our party loved their meals. Dress warmly if it's cold outside, as there can be a draft. Many patrons kept their jackets on throughout their meal."}
{"text":"Best brunch place around.  The eggs benedict are awesome and they have an option to have hash browns, fruit or soup with your breakfast."}
{"text":"If I could give 6 stars, I would. The food, service, music and atmosphere was a real treat. We were really surprised how delicious everything was. Will be back next weekend for sure!"}
{"text":"Great service, delicious, healthy food!! Love that there is vegan options!! Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Options for everyone including many veg and vegan. Very friendly and quick service. Unique and reasonably priced menu options. Great bright space with interested artwork."}
{"text":"Spot on. Waitstaff was helpful. Food came out quickly and was delicious as well as inventive. We'd eat there frequently if we lived in Toronto."}
{"text":"We brought our parents & in laws here today for brunch.  Two of us ordered the kale Caesar salad which was such a disappointment! $8 for a little soup bowl size. Kale was hard, dry and smothered in an incredibly salty dressing.  It was a pathetic salad. Both of them didn't not finish and just left it.   Husband and I were so embarrassed to bring our family   The chic pea burger & eggs Benny were not bad, but fries  were like warm."}
{"text":"I visited Lola's Kitchen to celebrate a birthday brunch with a few friends. For a brunch place in the city, the wait time before being seated surprisingly wasn't too long. Lola's is certainly a cozy restaurant equipped with kind and helpful staff. I ordered the mushroom benny and enjoyed it - the hollandaise sauce was fabulous and not at all overwhelming over the poached eggs. They even serve tea in adorable little teapots with even cuter tiny milk jugs on the side."}
{"text":"I gave Lola's Kitchen 3 stars because I had a 1-star experience but the people I was with really enjoyed their meal so one person's misery does not denote a 1-star experience.  We went back in the summer, when the patio is always slammed during brunch.  We got a table but everything is so crammed on the patio that you literally have to hop over people to get in and out.  The other two people I was with both enjoyed their meals, one of them got the eggs benny and the other ordered the Lola's breakfast.  I ordered the warm granola with a \"side\" of sausage.  The granola was fine, huge portion to be honest actually it was way to big (yes I am one of those people who complain about getting too much food, first world problems blah blah blah).  Now the sausage, and I used quotation marks for a reason, was another story.  I paid $4.00 for what I thought would be a few links or maybe pieces of sausage.  What I got was literally a cold, shot glass of chopped pieces of sausage.  It was such a small portion, MAYBE 25 cents worth, that we all assumed it was a part of one of their meals and I asked the server about my order of sausage.  I was than explained that this shot glass of meat was my order of sausage....hurray....  Lola's Kitchen is a fine restaurant, just stay away from the side dishes."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! The price of my curry bowl was very reasonable for how delicious it is! It was 14$, good size and a very nice ratio of vegetables and rice. My one thing about this place is their drinks are pretty pricey. Other than that, service and food was great and I would 110% eat here again!"}
{"text":"I had one of the best pasta dishes I've ever tasted at Lola's. Unfortuanlty, it was a dish on their daily special menu, but to this day I have tried to find those flavours that hit my taste buds.   Service was fantastic and efficient, atmosphere was welcoming and private. Great place, great food."}
{"text":"I've been to Lola's a couple of times and the food is good but the service really has problems. In my past visits the service was mediocre at best, starting off well and then forgetting about you once your plate is on the table. During my last time at Lola's we went for brunch and were told that there was a 20 minute wait for a table, which I was fine with. We waited our 20 minutes and returned only to be told that we can be seated but it would be 45 minutes from ordering to the time we get our food. WTF? My party of two then gets seated upstairs at a cruiser table barely big enough for people to have drinks on. After a moment of deliberation we walked out. It will be a long time before i return to Lola's."}
{"text":"Good brunch place. They have gluten free and vegan options. All their desserts are vegan. I had the eggs with mushroom and English toast and salad which was good. Their chocolate cake was enjoyable too."}
{"text":"GF dining can be tricky.   Our party ordered steak frites & a Portobello & double creamed cheese sandwich. Opted for the GF bread with the sandwich. I neglected asking for the bread to be toasted.   Sandwich was favorable.  The GF bread fell apart. This is not unusual.   Steak frites was delicious.   Treated ourselves to GF/V fudge cake. A bit dry but it was very good.   I would definitely return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"This place was so fabulous for a quiet dinner with a vegetarian friend. My tip in addition to the other great comments: get a spot upstairs which is quieter than you would expect from a busy and popular restaurant."}
{"text":"Lovely Lola's!   I've been wanting to try this place pre-name change and I'm so glad I finally got around to it. Lola's is in a beautiful space with good food and better service. Everything is casual enough but executed to T. You never feel like you're left in the lurch as everything is explained wonderfully. Very cute coffee service.   We ordered the stuffed french toast, small size, as a starter. It was just the right thing because our table of three all wanted to try it, but no one wanted to commit to a full plate of something sounding so sweet. This stuffed version had a lemon vanilla cheesecake stuffing with strawberries all over. It was kinda perfect. I could taste a bit of the eggyness on the fluffy bread which cut through the sweetness of the toppings and filling. We all got a fair share and I'm glad I can say I tried it.   I got the frittata with Lola's potatoes on the side for my breakfast main. I wish I was able to pick more sides though! At least two? Or maybe it could just come with toast. Anywho! This came with heaps of goats cheese and arugula atop a frittata of mushrooms, caramelized onions and marinated tomatoes. I was so glad that it was a personal, fresh frittata and not just a slice from something. The eggs were very well executed, no complaints there. Good thing I stuck with the potatoes to get that brunch feel. They were so good and also unique with the marsala spices. There was much more sweet potato than normal potato which was a pleasant surprise.   A very cute and delicious spot! Can't wait to come back for brunch OR lunch!"}
{"text":"Amazing vegetarian options. The nachos are light and tasty. And the quinua risotto is flavorful and sexy."}
{"text":"Loved the menu, the food was great! Passed by it many times without noticing it, but very cozy and cute inside. The only thing that's unfortunate are their hours :( but will go back again :)"}
{"text":"Nice spot with a great patio at the front. The food could have been a bit more flavourful but I'll definitely go again  to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Before entering, many people came out of the restaurant saying, \"oh my god, that was delicious\" and \"I am so full but so happy!\". Good sign. We came in on a weekday for lunch; it was busy but we got seated right away. For starters, I got the cauliflower fritters. $8 for 5 pieces. They were so good. They mashed the cauliflower like potatoes. It included a lime yogurt dip, which went really nicely together. I had the Black Bean Burger with fries and a pint of Mill Street Organic Lager ($5), while my partner had the Burger with salad. The black bean burgers tasted amazingly, without the excessive use of salt (which most places do with veggie burgers). The atmosphere is really cute. The stairs to the washrooms require a bit of care and caution - I think one of the steps is a little higher or shorter than the rest so it catches you by surprise. Overall, I would come back and try their California bowl and other veggie options. Service was great - not above and beyond, but standard."}
{"text":"The food is great. The service can be kind of slow and the wait for a table on the weekend for brunch is usually long. Great vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Croque champignon : Delicious combo of a thick portobello mushroom, soft brie, perfectly caramelized onions and an oozing egg on top! Even the dressed salad on the side was delicious (and of a good size).   Curried tofu: seasoning was good; though, the tofu was cooked in too much oil, and the home fries were unfortunately burnt. :("}
{"text":"Brunch was great. Got sat quickly and service was good. Loved the mushroom benedict and the frites were also delicious."}
{"text":"We live in the neighbourhood and have come here for brunch a half-dozen times. Service is good. However, I find that the food quality is inconsistent; sometimes it's excellent (!) and other times it's mediocre (overcooked potatos, wilted lettuce). Lola's is the only place that offers vegan and gluten-free options, so I wish the quality of the food was more consistent."}
{"text":"A nice neighborhood brunch spot!  It's a converted house, the inside is modern, very sunny and welcoming...and bigger than I thought!  They put a lot of effort into creating an interesting menu.  I ordered the cheesecake stuffed french toast which looked amazing and almost overwhelming!!!  Thick slices of toast coated in egg custard, stuffed with cheesecake filling and drenched in berry compote... saucy, sweet, and decadent. It's good if you like sweets. I have a big stomach and I only ate half of it.   Other options looked like tasty alternatives. - Beef hash, tender beef, potatoes, eggs, garlic mayo with crispy onions. - Breakfast poutine - it's fries, homemade gravy  topped with two fried eggs and all sorts of breakfasty things! - the Kitchen Sink which included eggs and bits, bits being a mix of sausage, cheese, etc served with toast. That looked good. If I didn't have french toast I would have gone for the kitchen sink.  The sexy potatoes are ...cute, I don't know about sexy!  Mix of sweet potatoes and regular potatoes, I didn't have any, but they looked like a nice side but not jazzy enough.  The service was awesome and made brunch so much more enjoyable.  I was hosting a brunch for a small group and needed two extra spots.  They had a cancellation upstairs and asked if we wanted to be seated on the top floor so we could hear each other better.  The top floor of this venue is perfect for mid-sized  group reservations (20 - 30 people). Sparkly red chairs, a bar available (For hire in the evening) and the room showcased artwork from local artists.  They did an awesome job keeping track of the group's orders and splitting our bills. The service was spectacular and beyond my expectations.  This place isn't as crazy busy as other brunch places. It had a steady stream of customers, probably locals.  The venue still had a lot of room at 11am but was packed by 1pm (We were there on a Sunday).  I'm curious about their lunch menu and will have to give it a try!"}
{"text":"We have only had good experiences going here. Staff is helpful, engaging and funny.  Food is delicious! We've had the short ribs, lamb burger, poutine, chicken sandwich and all of it has been flavourful and plentiful. Mmmm the frites are soooo good. The best part? One of us has Celiac disease and Lola's is completely accommodating and even has a dedicated gluten free fryer."}
{"text":"We were looking for lighter fare with both meat and vegan options in the Church and Wellesley area of Toronto. The website for Lola's Kitchen was pretty basic, but the few pictures it had of the food looked appealing, so we took a chance. We were very happy with our choice! The food was delicious, fresh and unique with lots of meat-lovers, vegan and gluten-free choices. Roasted beet salad with mixed greens, goat cheese and apples (plus the chicken breast we added); yummy quinoa mushroom risotto; an ample and diverse Mediterranean tapas platter; black bean, mushroom and walnut vegan burger. Everything was very good and the service was great. And the bill was very reasonable. We would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Lola's can get pretty noisy for brunch. It seems like a few people in there were waiting for tinder dates. They have fresh ingredients and plate nicely, and the interior looks like an old living-room-turned-cafe. I had the pulled beef on top a bed-of-kale-greens type dish and ingredients were fresh. I am more motivated to go during the summer though, when the patio is open."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with friends and was very impressed. It was awesome to find a menu with multiple vegetarian and gluten-free options, and still a great selection of hearty brunch choices.   I ordered the breakfast kale bowl ($14): kale, quinoa, leeks, fennel, squash, chorizo sausage and two poached eggs with a light drizzle of oil. It was easily the best brunch meal I've had in ages - yummy and filling, but not overboard!  Service was excellent as well. Will definitely be back as I wanted to try half the menu!"}
{"text":"Lola's kitchen was a fun experience... I went with a friend for sunday brunch and had the Croque Lola.  It was yummy and tasted healthy, but not in the bland grainy kinda way.  Lola's potatoes, one of the sides, reminded me of something that my aunt makes and added a nice kick to the meal.  I also had the butternut squash soup which turned out to be quite spicy, likely from the green hot pepper oil that was drizzled onto the soup.    Lola's is very homey, and not only because it is set in an old victorian house.  Our server lived up to this homey image and was very friendly and welcoming.  We sat in the back room right by the large graffiti artwork, which, if you looked at carefully had several quirky quotes and pieces of writing scattered throughout.  Making out what was written was fun and made our time even more enjoyable."}
{"text":"....and this is how you do brunch RIGHT. MMM! So good. Well-balanced, healthy, creative, delicious, and interesting flavors for a perfect pick-me-up to start your day. Prices range between $13-18, but the quality is definitely there. I ordered the Curried Tofu Scramble and had no complaints. Everyone else in my party picked something different and were all content with their choices. Small menu, but I think that's how it should be done: don't think you can go wrong with any of their choices!  Many of their meals revolve around veggies and beans, so if you're a fan of that - fantastic! It's enough to fill you up but light enough that you don't feel like doing anything after. Would definitely not mind coming back for round 2 brunch!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I choose to go there for dinner on a Friday night because it is very vegan friendly (for me).   First impression of the restaurant was that it was cozy and trendy. The lighting was just right, not too dark and not too bright. It feels silly mentioning the lighting, but I'm someone who doesn't enjoy dimly lit restaurants or fluorescent food court like lighting.  For drinks, I got the lychee martini (deliciously fruity but wasn't too sweet), and the bf got a Kahlua/bailey's/coffee martini (he said it was a little too bitter for his liking).  For food, we shared the kale ceaser salad, California bowl, and the med plate. Little did we know that the portions were delightfully huge! The three dishes tasted flavourful, healthy, and light but filling. To be honest, the dips in the med plate were mediocre, I've had better store bought hummus and tahini, but the variety of delicious pickled veggies made up for it.   I will most likely return to Lola's Kitchen to try their brunch menu. :)"}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast/brunch! Amazing  service! Loved the eggs Benedict! Cozy inside...  one of those little jems!"}
{"text":"We came at 3:30pm on a Wednesday evening and were promptly seated. Our food came fairly fast after we ordered it and me ordered the smoked salmon sand which as well as the portablelo mushroom one. I rally enjoyed the smoked salmon sand which as everything was very soft and creamy (as there was avocado and garlic Creme) a generous helping of fries were served with the sand which and the fries were cut fairly thin and were done very well. I was hesitant to spend 15+ dollars on a mere sand which but the portions were great and tasted great as well. Servers were fast and friendly, and the ambience of the restaurant was nice. The artwork in the restaurant was also very pleasing to look at.   There were also a very large amount of vegetarian and gluten free options. Would come back again."}
{"text":"This place does fresh, local and delicious like no where else in Toronto.  To top it all off the service is friendly and the fries are amazing.  My only compliant is they aren't open for dinner!"}
{"text":"This place took me by surprise. I was not expecting much because it was first time to eat here, but I just had the best chicken sandwich and fresh cut fries for my lunch last week. Good thing my friends and I arrived a little bit after eleven in the morning for our lunch or else we would have to wait to be seated! This place gets full really quick! Would come back to try their brunch which is only available on weekends."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch. Food was nothing special, and two out of the four of us got sick. Would not go back."}
{"text":"I decided to finally try this place and it was great. I had the huevos rancheros, it was great I ordered the side salad instead of potatoes, it was fresh and not dripping in dressing. I will be back."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend for the first time for dinner, and we were actually really impressed! We had looked at the menu prior to trying it, and were curious. There seems to be a lot going on in the recipes, but what I tried was amazing! I had a salmon sandwich with avocado, cucumbers, bunch of other stuff, and a kale caesar side. It was super tasty.  My g/f had their brie-portabello mushroom burger and the vegetarian poutine, and she was in heaven.   We usually prefer asian food when dining out, but Lola's is on our list now, and we'll certainly be back. Recommend this place for sure.  **The ONLY thing that could have made this better for me, was that so many items that looked awesome had goat cheese. Just why, Canada? What is this obsession with goat cheese? I guess I could asked for substitution, but I'm shy lol."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm impressed! I'm so excited to have another vegan option since Camrose is closing at the end of the month for renovations.   I came in for a late lunch. So many options on the menu that are either gluten-free, vegetarian, vegan, or some combination of these, that it was actually difficult to decide what to have.   In the end I opted for a \"petite\" kale Caesar, with their homemade cashew based dressing, and the quinoa risotto. Both were absolutely delicious, and arrived very quickly.   The Caesar was really interesting... It was topped deep fried capers, what looked like deep fried rosemary and what I think might have been 2 sticks of deep fried polenta. I know that sounds like a lot of deep fried stuff, but since they're just light toppings, they gently contribute to the appearance and flavor of the dish without overwhelming it. Plus... If you're eating that much kale, I think you're automatically forgiven.   The quinoa risotto was delicious, flavorful and filling. Lots of caramelized onions and truffle oil which were the main flavors.   The servers were patient helpful and friendly. The interior had a cute, cosy, hip decor.   Without a doubt I'll be back. I can't wait to try their breakfast!"}
{"text":"Went here on Saturday of may long weekend without a reservation and got a table within 10 mins.  The only thing is your waiting next to these plant pots with cigarette buds and garbage in them, which grossed me out.   The staff was nice and attentive even though they were busy.   We got a seat inside cause it was still a little chilly outside. I went over the menu and couldn't see the French toast that everyone raved about including blogTO. I asked the waitress and she advised that hasn't been on the menu in like a year and its still all over the internet. So I'm putting it out there...   THEY DO NOT SERVE THE STUFFED FRENCH TOAST ANYMORE!!!    I was disappointed but was hungry so had go pick something else.  Order their $5 Cesar!! Almost everyone had one when we looked around, so you certainly can't go wrong. It was delicious. It wasn't watered down, thick and spicy!   I choose the mushroom eggs Benny without onions and Dave got lola's breakfast with frites.  We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals. My dish was loaded with mushrooms, you can take the herbs and lemon in the sauce and the home fries were nice and crispy. Mine was delicious. Dave enjoyed his too but it was eggs and bacons and frites and he loved the frites.  What started off disappointing left me satisfied and besides there's so many dessert places around that I was able to satisfy my sweet tooth after.   My only suggestion is adding a sweet dish to the brunch menu."}
{"text":"Loved the place!! We had a delicious brunch on a lazy Sunday morning. It was a sunny summer's day last year and we really enjoyed relaxing and eating on the patio. The food was delicious, service was great! We will surely go to Lola's again."}
{"text":"A vegan (with meat options as well) restaurant which can satisfy even the most discerning carnivore!   Depending on what you order it is a healthy choice, filling, cozy with a nice patio and a decent beer selection which is an integral part of any hot summer day.  The staff were all extremely friendly and accommodated us with smiles on even though we were a little picky.   The girl (Jen?) who was helping us got us a great seat on the patio as soon as it cleared up, recommended beer selection honestly and was just all around fun to talk to.  You get the vibe that you are just hanging with friends and it was just a great experience which we hope to relive again in the future.  I came here because of the amazing amount of great reviews and I will be back for the food, service and beer.  The only complaint/suggestion I would have would be to get some darker beers on the menu. I like mine strong like an espresso but they had many options which kept me satisfied and I got to experiment a bit.  If you are in the area or even far away I would come by and give it a shot no matter who you are.  Beware, I hear it gets packed on holidays, brunch, and evening seating so make some reservations if possible!   Cheers guys"}
{"text":"We had Brunch on Saturday.  We were seated quickly and we both had delicious creative meals.  Mine was the curried Tofu and my wife loved the portobello mushroom with Brie.  We both look forward to going back soon.  Service was excellent too."}
{"text":"I love Lola's Kitchen. It is one of my first picks when I'm looking for a \"healthy-esq\" dining experience in the Church- Wellesley area.   What to eat:  I've tried almost the entire menu, these are a few of my favourite picks:   - California Bowl ($15) - purple and black kale, organic quinoa OR brown rice, avocado, sundried tomatoes, toasted organic nuts and seeds, grilled organic tofu and sweet cider vinaigrette. I like to add either grilled chicken ($4.5) or roasted salmon ($8) for an extra kick of protein. When I'm feeling extra hungry I will also add in beets to the salad. This is definitely my go to dish - fulfills all your macro nutrients and portion size is large enough to have for leftovers.   - Burger OR Lamb Burger ($17-$19) - 100% local burgers. I order the burger on a gluten free bun (~$3?). The burger meat is legit - thick and a juicy, all round really enjoyable burger. The burgers are also served with tasty fries or a salad.   - Fresh juices ($3/6) - The juice selection change seasonally. I really enjoy the spiced pear juice or the ginger and beet juice. I usually order a small juice with a bottle of carbonated water and combine the two together for a carbonated fresh fruit juice!  - Desserts - Carrot Cake or Vanilla Bean Cheesecake - All desserts are vegan and super delish. Gluten free options are available. Portion size of cakes are definitely shareable!   What else to know:   - Sweet front patio seating opened in summer. Lots of umbrellas for shade, only negative are all the beautiful flower beds surrounding the patio, they become a major bee magnet.   - Although price of menu items are steeper than fellow neighbours - the quality of the food is on point.    - Be warned, the  two seat tables long the south wall of the restaurant are on an uneven floor, request for alternative seating if you don't fancy  feeling slanted the entire meal.   - Can get busy during lunch hour and dinner hours - best to make a reservation!"}
{"text":"It's was a good overall experience. The decor is pretty nice and the eggs Benny was good but it was a bit cold when it came."}
{"text":"Awesome Food! The service was a little slow. They also short changed us by 25 cents. Bummer because the food was so GOOD."}
{"text":"I had the mushroom eggs Benny with frites.  My friend had the brunch bowl.  Wins: great combination of Hollandaise sauce and mushrooms; delicious frites; friendly service; great atmosphere  Things to improve: poached eggs were slightly overdone. Brunch bowl would be better without the beef jus. It made the vegetables soggy and less appetizing."}
{"text":"Previously, I've done a detailed review on Lola's giving it a 5-star.  Today I had lunch at the restaurant again but this time, it reminded me of its faults. This was my third visit and I ordered the Smoked Salmon sandwich (which I had the initial time). The moment I had my second bite, I regretted giving that five.  The smoked salmon and everything inside was great! All except for the sandwich bread. It was the tough kind already, and on top they toasted it too. It was so hard to chew apart especially the sides. After this meal, the top part inside my mouth was very scratched up. Same feeling you get when your mouth gets burnt from hot food :( disappointed.  Now deserves 1-star less!"}
{"text":"We came for brunch and had to wait only about fifteen minutes for a table for four. Located at Church and Wellesley neighbourhood, you could find another few brunch joints around if the line for this one was too long. This place seems a bit hipster/trendy, and I suspect their menu changes with the seasons or trends, etc. They do have good vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options. I ordered the quinoa with chorizo and kale breakfast bowl- really good! My companion ordered Shakshuka, which looked great. Lovely interior design, cozy. Would return, though not sure when for the brunch- either at opening time, or towards tail end?"}
{"text":"Been here on a few occasions and it's been very different experiences. Overall, the food is great. Your classic sandwiches and salad shop with local sources and heart put into their food. Lots of vegan and gluten-free options means there's something for everyone from appetizer to dessert. The shop has a sort of charm that makes you feel like you're at a very very \"local\" restaurant with simple roots and a close knit patronage that knows each other.  The first time I came in I got a salad - one of their signature bestsellers, but I can't remember exactly which one. Was it the Santa Fe? California? What I do remember is that my salad was well prepared. I wasn't getting a bunch of diced vegetables put in a bowl, I wasn't getting something made early this morning before the lunch rush, and I wasn't getting something that basically just came out of the fridge. This salad was portioned, tossed, and served at a nice temperature that didn't make me feel like I was eating my fridge. The chicken was warm, my kale was fresh but not frozen, the roasted nuts were crunchy. It may sound really weird but I was super glad my salad was warm! There was also tons of salad - I got two meals in one.  The next time I went back was with a large group - fortunately they take reservations! It was a birthday celebration and we had a variety of dietary restrictions to accommodate. The lamb curry was average, the ribs were amazing, salads and sandwiches are a safe choice (though not much to write home about), and the polenta fries were a letdown. The polenta fries were actually tasty, but for the price I paid, my fries came out to be $1 apiece! I wasn't ready for that at all, and they weren't outstanding enough to warrant me spending that kind of money. Desserts cater to different diets too (e.g. vegan chocolate cake!) which was exactly what we needed.  Service may seem untimely but the shop is more local meaning a little short on staff, but overall they are attentive and accommodating. I'll definitely be back - but with a small group only to ensure the experience is pleasant and I'm not the one rowdy table (oops)."}
{"text":"First time at Lola's a couple weeks ago.  Food was very delicious... it isn't often that I can find a place that makes tofu well.  It was very crowded and busy though.  The service was decent.  The food was amazing though.  I'll definitely be back for more vegan food!"}
{"text":"Great place for brunch. Was very impressed with the quality of food and service. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"A nice brunch spot that takes reservations! A little further than my usual haunts, but worth the trip.  I ordered the cheesecake stuffed french toast and a side of bacon. I made the mistake of ordering the petit version though. I had already had breakfast, and with the side of meat I thought it would be enough. It wasn't. It's a very small (but yummy) portion. Go full sized or go home. Many in the group ordered the brunch bowl, an large bowl of mostly potatoes (sweet and traditional) with mushrooms and sausage topped with egg. No one could finish it. Good thing I had the petit and was able to help out! Was less impressed with the grilled cheese with bacon. (Of course with bacon! Always with BACON!) Not fantastic. Didn't love the Lola's potatoes that was served with it either.   My only real complaint? $3 for a really small cup of tea. No offers for refills, not loose tea, not even a tea pot. The $4 lattes were quite loved, although also so small the my friend had to order two. Perhaps we are an overcaffinated bunch, but a latte should be larger than a handful. (And tea should come in pots!)"}
{"text":"I went for dinner and was pleased with the vegetarian and vegan options. I had some vegetarian burger that it was among the best I've had in the city. I upgraded to a beat salad that was also very good. Service was great and the place is well decorated and clean."}
{"text":"I was always hesitant to try Lola's due to the overall \"tree hugging save the world\" vibe I got off reading the menu and previous reviews. I just didn't want to end up having to eat gluten free or vegetarian or salads against my will.  We went for brunch on a Sunday, the wait for 2 of us was about 15 minutes which wasn't bad. The hostesses were super polite and friendly.   Upon being seated in some of the most comfortable restaurant chairs I have ever sat in we were informed caesars and mimosas were only $5 each, which was great so I got one of each. The mimosa was delicious and had lots of champagne, the caesers we both agreed were a bit too heavy and weighed down by the BBQ sauce used in them. The fresh bean it came with tasted homemade and was delicious even though we felt like the drink could have done a better job in following the light fresh theme of the food and place as a whole.  The menu and food passing by looked equally incredible. I had the brunch bowl and my partner enjoyed the eggs rancheros. The brunch bowl came on top of a generous portion of arugula which gave it an amazing light fresh feel with just the right amount of potatoes, sauce and meat. Rarely if ever do I finish my entire meal but this was crushed in record time and left me beyond full, it really was a solid solid dish. My partner really enjoyed her rancheros but found the beans were a bit hard and undercooked.  The service was fantastic.  Overall we would for sure come back in the future. My worries of walking into a vegan hippy paradise were unfounded and they really did do a fantastic job of showcasing quality freshness at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Lola's Commissary is really close to both my workplace and my home but I literally stumbled upon it just the other day. I am so glad I did and now it's going to be my default brunch option.   The restaurant is on the first floor of a house and is probably a lot of fun in the summer out on the deck. We went in on a wintery afternoon and loved the cozy interiors. We were seated right away and greeted by a very nice waitress. The place is bright and happy in a rustic yet artsy kind of way.   And the food is great too. I ordered the 'shroom benny with sexy fries (yummy side) and my DH ordered the salmon benedict with frites. I tasted both and although both were good, I LOVED the 'shroom benny.   We will definitely be back for leisurely weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Food was exceptional. Decor a bit dark. Service perfect. Coffee a bit strong. Highly recommend. Will go again.  Update - 2nd trip just as good.  Had the exact same thing the mushroom benny.  Super tasty!  I'm not even vegan, but this dish makes me want to become one..."}
{"text":"While staying in Toronto for the Toronto International Food Festival, my group and I stumbled upon this place and decided to go in and have some brunch before heading to the airport.   We were seated right away and had a pleasant waitress.   Being from the states, the food on the menu seemed so \"healthy\" to me. This place does use organic ingredients which made the experience much better. The orange juice was good and I ended up getting the brunch bowl which was DELICIOUS. I wish I could come here everyday and eat that. It was so good and filling.   If you're in the Toronto area and want a good meal, definitely stop in here! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great patio! Service was fast and super friendly! Food was fantastic - we got a bunch of items and shared them! Fritters and kale Caesar salad were amazing as appetizers! And the black bean burger  was yummy! Overall just a great night out!"}
{"text":"I call it hipster chic with a solid menu.   I had the Shakshouka and throughly enjoy it.  Worth the wait, will be back!"}
{"text":"Lola's kitchen is awesome. definitely a fave dt hangout spot. Perfect for really anything. In summer they have a great patio, and they have a variety of seating inside which is cozy. It is pretty small so if it's busy it can be awhile till u find a seat but they do have a nice bar to sit at. Each day they have drink specials that are great deals. Last night was 5 dollar pints which is great deal. There brunch is delicious and big portions but major heads up its a loooong wait. If you have the time though it's worth it. It's a very relaxing atmosphere with great music, and nice service. Always a nice time."}
{"text":"Okay. I have to say that this was the best brunch Ive ever had. The brunch bowl itself gets 5 stars. The potatoes and braised beefs, topped off with a dollop of goat cheese...MMMM. I'd come back just for that.  Other highlights: great service, great location, lovely artsy decor. However, it was quite packed with people always waiting for a table to open up. There are no reservations allowed for weekend brunch. Combined with the music and the casual talk happening all over, it was fairly loud and hard to communicate with someone sitting right in front of you without raising your voice. Delicious food and coffee, but a bit difficult to carry a conversation on a busy weekend."}
{"text":"It was very disappointing that they had taken the cheesecake-stuffed French toast off the menu. But what is really unacceptable for a brunch place is that they didn't replace it with waffles, crepes or any other pancake variant. Not even a croissant to be had. Perhaps this is a transitional situation with their menu, but for the moment, I would steer clear.   Additionally, service was slow and they insisted on serving the burger well done.  For what it is worth, our server was very apologetic and my DC indicated that her eggs were tasty."}
{"text":"I had the salmon. Delicious but did not like the side of palenta and rapini. I informed the waitress that I was not a fan of the side and she substituted for salad. Ok for the price, may come back and try the burger if in the area. Nice staff, but took long to come to our table (and it wasn't that busy). Overall ok restaurant."}
{"text":"I would have given it more than 5 stars if I could. Amazing food. great seating. My old friend and I met at Lola's kitchen after 10 years and this place made the meeting worthwhile.  We took the outside seating in the amazing weather.i had egg rancheros and my morning coffee and I must say I haven't had better brunch in my life. The guac gave such a texture to the combination that was beyond imagination. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a brunch option."}
{"text":"I ordered the eggs rancheros and let me tell you that's the best decision I have taken in my whole life ( yet) :D it's was amazing !!! Crispy thin tortilla topped with amazing spicy beans  and yummy scrambled eggs :)  The staff is very good it :) Our server was the bartender and she was soooo sweet :)   Too bad they have only regular coffee ( no cappuccino or mocha ) :(  otherwise perfect :)"}
{"text":"So good! Lola's is a healthy alternative that I would love to visit again. Everything is just so healthy there and perfectly vegetarian friendly. I got the California bowl that was an amazing combination of fresh crunch courtesy of the sprouts and kale, and warm fill-'er-up goodness from the quinoa. It came with chunky grilled tofu that satisfies the craving for meaty texture and protein. I added grilled shrimp for an extra $5. So worth it. The saltiness of the shrimp and sun dried tomatoes was a perfect contrast to the creamy avocado.  Tip: make reservations for lunch on a weekday. It can get busy!"}
{"text":"They have a terrific brunch.  Love their many veg options.  This morning I enjoyed the veg benny with mushrooms which came with homefries or salad.  I took the homefries and was pretty  happy with the yummy spices.  Here's a tip: get there as close to opening for brunch 'cause it fills up fast."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Stuffed in Challah French Toast?  Color me Excited!  I could eat this 'breakfast' forever...I honestly didn't want this meal to end. When I finally finished the plate in front of me, I was seriously contemplating ordering another round of this Most.Amazing.French.Toast.Ever. The only thing stopping me was the partial embarrassment of actually placing the 2nd order and, oh, yea, I had just come from a pilates class.   The host and servers were great, it wasn't that busy on a Saturday afternoon (12.30p) much to my surprise. The restaurant is housed in an adorable victorian-esque house and the space is open, bright and tastefully done.   The only thing I was dissatisfied with: the measly skinny pathetic slivers of bacon. For $3. The skinniest, most disappointing slips of bacon I've ever tasted in my life. They really need to do something about that...they were worth maybe $1, definitely not $3.   But that crazy cheesecake stuffed french toast...Phew. I'll definitely be back before I leave the TO."}
{"text":"I noticed that the reviews for Lola's had a bimodal distribution - people either really loved it or not at all. Unfortunately, I will not be joining the group that loves it. The food was mediocre for its price. I had the eggs benny, which was passable but the home fries were undercooked. My boyfriend had the scrambled tofu and we both found that the dish watery. My biggest criticism of this restaurant is that they don't cook like they care. They churn out food very quickly, akin to a food court fast food restaurant, and I can't say the quality is much better (though the price is quite a bit higher).  On the up side, I found the service to be pleasant and not too slow. The patio looked like it had good ambience.   Overall, I can't say I would recommend this restaurant and its popularity surprises me."}
{"text":"SOOO GOOD!! Came here for brunch and got the frittata (tomatoes, caramelized onions, mushrooms, arugula) which was amazingggg.  The portion was just right and it comes with a side of salad, frites or home fries. I got the salad in an attempt to be healthy and it was fantastic with the perfect amount of dressing mixed in.  My friend got fries though and they looked really good.    But OMG the caramelized onions were perfection in there along with the mushrooms that were seasoned so well.  It was a litttttle bit on the salty side but whatever. The service here is also great.  I NEED to come back n try so many other things!"}
{"text":"The neighbourhood where this is located is quiet and nice. It's a great spot for brunch. We sat outside in the patio area to soak up some of the nice sun. The place gets busy so I would suggest getting there a bit early to get a seat.  The staff is friendly.  After a short wait we were seated outside. They have a good selection of brunch options. I got the mushroom, spinach, and onion Benny. I loved the organic eggs, which were poached perfectly. I enjoyed the mushrooms and spinach. I thought that there were too much onions though, which over powered the dish. Next time I would not order onions with the benny or get the regular benny. The hollandaise sauce was good nice and creamy. The salad that came with the Benny was fresh and not overly dressed. I liked that they serve fresh and organic food.  I would come back and try some of their other dishes. I'd also like to try the Mimosa next time, which looked really yummy."}
{"text":"2.5 stars, with a generous round up.  Last year this would have been hands down a 5 star review.  The interior is charming, the service is slow but always gracious and friendly and the patio is amazing on sunny day.  Even the bathrooms are charming here.  But last year, my breakfasts here were massiv and the perfect combination of mass and taste.  (Based on the rule that there are only two types of breakfasts: 1) The greasy spoon diner/ cheap place that gives you a BIG amount of meh to ok quality food- but really hits the spot or 2) the moderately priced breakfast place that has a smaller portion but nice delicate and careful flavours for ex: le petit dejeuner )  Last year I remember ordering the eggs benny with soup option for a small price more.  The Eggs benny came with a HEAPING pile of delicious mushroom.  The homefries were delicious and plentiful.  And the soup- to DIE for- (ps: soup for breakfast?  almost never but this place knows how to do soup!)  This year? My mushroom egg benny was modest.  a few slices of mushrooms hidden under a very well poached egg.  The english muffin was average and, in fact, got in the way because it looked massive in  the face of the pathetic amount of mushrooms that they used.  The homefries were good, but also smaller in portion.  Maybe a little dry but that could have just been an off day. and the soup?  Not on the menu.  I'm sorry...but this place has gone downhill.  The interior and staff are just as nice and friendly...but I will no longer put this on my best brunch list and definitely would not go more than a block out of my way to go here."}
{"text":"I went here the day after running the Scotiabank marathon. We were looking for something filling but healthy to keep our streak of healthiness going. Everything on the menu sounded great and looked healthy/filling/delicious coming out of the kitchen getting served to diners around us. If I lived in TO I would definitely go to this place often. The atmosphere is pretty cool too."}
{"text":"OK.  So the food isn't bad.  And the setting in the converted house was cute.  But the prices are just way over the top, both for the food and the atmosphere.  Maybe, as some other reviewers noted, its this neighborhood, this location, but spending 15 bucks for a basic brunch is not on my list of things to do.  It just isn't worth it.  The food is good, but nothing special, and something you could get for much cheaper at Saving Grace or Grapefruit Moon.  Or for that matter, probably at tons of brunch places across Toronto.  The food at Lola's is just not good enough to compete at those prices."}
{"text":"Just awesome.  While waiting for a friend I started w/ an Americano and a glass of grapefruit juice.  Both were lovely.  I ordered the regular brekkie w/ bacon and scrambled eggs. A side af frites and salad. The fresh herbs and spices that they put on everything is so sweet, I could eat it forever. I also got a side or aoli for the frites, which were perfect. No old oil in this kitchen that is for sure! The toast was some fantastic crusty whole wheat loaf. My only issue was that the dressing on the salad was a tad bit oily and could have used some tang. The smoked bacon was a nice change too.  My friends had the eggs bennie which I don't normally have but must say it looked delicious. The peameal bacon on it looked so good. One girlfriend had the potato wedges instead of frites and they were delicious as well.  All in all everything was FRESH and tasted that way. Kind of like a fresh spring day. Thanks Lola's!! I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"A very cute place in the middle of downtown (just a short walk from Yonge & Bloor) - it has great vegetarian/vegan/gluten-free options. I had their black bean burger and it was the most filling burger ever. Very delicious too and it comes with a lot of fries on the side. Good value overall. Surprisingly there was no one else at the restaurant while we were dining which was a surprise considering all the good reviews about this place. Oh well, better for us!"}
{"text":"Great place for brunch on the weekends!! I got the kale Caesar salad and they give you such amazing portion of kale! I love the unique pairing and flavours. Also the $5 mimosas are too yummy to pass up! This place in general has awesome vegetarian options as well. Highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on the weekend. Patio is really nice. Note that if you choose to sit on the patio, you can't change your mind and move inside.   I wanted a cappuccino (which was on the drinks menu) but was told they don't use their espresso machine on weekends. My friend got coffee, and it had specs in it - we told the server and she got us a new cup which was much better.  In terms of food, we tried the eggs ranchero with side of home fries, and the shakshouka with side of salad. I tried the shakshouka and wasn't a big fan. It's basically a lot of baked tomatoes, with two eggs on top. Kinda like pasta sauce but without the pasta. I really enjoyed the eggs ranchero though! Great flavour, and the lime gave it a nice kick. Ingredients tasted fresh.   Home fries were crispy on outside and cooked just right, but would've liked more seasoning on them. The side salad was pretty average (greens with a balsamic dressing) but we were glad we ordered it to balance out our meals and to get some greens in us."}
{"text":"breakfast kale bowl was enjoyable. 45+min wait is common for weekend brunch. i'd still come back :)"}
{"text":"Greaat indoor decor. Great service. Great food.their homemade popatoes are awesome"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I actually think the food (brunch boooowl!) is GOOD here. I first visited when it opened in 2009 as Lola's Commissary and I've been back a number of times since. Oh, and I brought a party of 16 people for brunch this weekend. In short, I make a more-than-adequate judge.  That said, I'll let other people rate the eats. I'm giving my review weighted on the following specific thumbs-down factors:  - Like one of the reviewers below, I used the e-mail option on their website to contact them about booking a large reservation and never heard back.  - For a supposedly veggie-friendly restaurant, they're certainly no longer flexible about substituting veg*n items, which is what I always enjoyed about having brunch here (I used to swap sausage for tofu, which is also on their brunch menu - pretty simple). Now they just nix the meat and if you want tofu, they'll take away the eggs as well. I guess \"vegetarian option available\" just means you get less for the same price.  - Speaking of getting less...the portions are shrinking. I almost had to laugh at the juice ($5 with tax and tip). It was literally a shot. For breakfast! Where Lola's sources such beautiful glass thimbles, I don't know, but I do know that if your portion sizes look like a sight gag, they're too small. See photo.  In summation: the food induces smiles but the service doesn't anymore. At least our chilly waitress didn't mind splitting up the bill. Amp it up please, Lola's? I hate seeing a cute neighbourhood spot go downhill."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch yesterday with 3 others.  A few of us ordered the Eggs Benny, one ordered the Eggs Rancheros and I ordered the mushroom Benny.  The mushroom version of eggs Benedict was very tasty with a generous portion of mushrooms.  My friend really enjoyed her Rancheros.  My only issue is I asked for the poached egg not to be runny but it still was so that made my meal less enjoyable.    We had to wait quite a while to get a table (they don't take reservations) but it was worth it.  We were seated upstairs where it was nicely decorated and the tables were spread out.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  There are lots of brunch options on Church and I'd recommend trying this one!"}
{"text":"We ate outside for lunch. GREAT atmosphere. The food was amazing. We were able to get meals with meat and vegan meals, which was great."}
{"text":"o...m...g. The eggs benny I had were amazing. The hollandaise sauce was lemony and so delicious. The home fries were not dry and so good. I am usually not blown away by breakfast  but I was this time. And their patio is so cute too."}
{"text":"Excellent Hueos Rancheros.. Toast and Other Breakfast Specials.  But the highlight was the Customer Service!!  Absolutely floored by the Service.. 5 Stars!  Thank You People"}
{"text":"This is an old house transformed into a cozy brunch restaurant. It has a nice feel to it - very casual with friendly staff to greet you at the door.   Brunch Eggs Rancheros were so delicious. The guacamole, sour cream and all the works of a Mexican dish.   I asked for the homemade hot sauce - it was not spicy...unfortunate. I also asked for mayo which I wasn't told would cost me an extra dollar...same with the hot sauce.  I'm giving this a 4/5 because I feel like the server should have warned me that the sauces would cost extra.   Based on previous reviews, the washrooms weren't cold. They are up the stairs and I didn't see an accessibility washroom for those who may have a hard time climbing stairs."}
{"text":"I am still in search for my favorite brunch spot in Toronto. This is currently at the top of my list.  I would consider Lola's to be a solid brunch option. There are a lot of food options and you're not confined to picking one dish every time because each dish is made really well. The food was made just right, and I would return to try other dishes. I have had better brunch in other cities however, I do think this place is best option I've seen in Toronto thus far.  I read other reviews noting that the wait time for parties of 3 or more is significantly long. I didn't run into that issue, I came with a party of 3 on a Sunday around 11 am and we were seated within 15 min. I noticed as we were leaving there was a long line so I'm assuming coming earlier is a better option if you don't want to wait too long to be seated."}
{"text":"Cosy little restaurant where you can eat some sandwiches, burgers, salads and poutines at a decent price. Quality is very good, service excellent. Each night, there is a special on drinks (eg. Tuesday is 5$ pints) Try it!"}
{"text":"Waitress was kinda rude. She just out down our food and walked away.. She seemed super pissed. She did not make eye contact with us the entire time. I used to love this place but lately it's gotten worse. It used to be my go-to place but I don't think I'll go back again. Food was okay but there's lots of options down town"}
{"text":"I can't give you an accurate description of this restaurant as I didn't eat here.  But... there was not 1 person there at 4:05 to eat which I always find alarming.  The staff was very friendly and nice but... I left because the floor and menu was so dusty and dirty that I couldn't imagine eating there. So I left,"}
{"text":"This is a 3.5 star.    We came in around noon on Sunday morning for brunch, and waited about 5 mins for a nice patio seat. We enjoyed the atmosphere a lot but the food was par.    My bf and I shared the mushroom Benny and cheesecake-stuffed french toast. Nothing really impressive. Rather, the stuffed french toast was a bit disappointed. After reading many praises for it on Yelp i was really looking forward to it. But it just failed to live up to my expectation...the cheesecake part is a bit too heavy, and there's not enough fruits/jam to balance it. It felt a bit too heavy.   Overall nice experience, worth trying."}
{"text":"Ever since my beloved Hoof Café closed down I've been on a Brunch hunt all over Toronto to find a new spot to get my kicks.    My best friend Doctor-in-Training and I love to brunch whenever he's in town (he's studying in Calgary) and so with dining companion in hand, and empty stomachs on Easter Sunday - we were ready to roll.  We arrived shortly after 10AM when doors open.  I had called in advance to confirm that they were open considering it was Easter Sunday and all.  We were the first ones in the restaurant, and had the restaurant to ourselves for pretty much 90% of our stay.  As we were nearing the end of our meal, and people were starting to wake up, a few tables trickled in but it was in no way busy.  I guess that's because all the good people were at church while we were busy stuffing our faces.  The decor is really simple, but chic at the same time.  The bar is towards the entrance, and there is also a fireplace.  The space is bright and airy with a loft-like feel and lots of natural lighting shining through the many windows.    The waiting staff were all very friendly.  The male barista sported a bunny-eared headband which I found mildly amusing.    I ordered the Frittata (vegetarian dish) and Doctor-in-Training ordered Lola's Benny.  All menu items come with your choice of soup, side salad or potatoes.  I opted for the salad.    The frittata was quite savory.  It was prepared with red peppers, mushrooms, caramelized onion and goat's cheese.  The side salad had a nice viniagrette which was a perfect balance of tartness and sweetness.  Yummy!  Lola's Benny was served on polenta instead of the traditional English muffin, but my DC seemed to enjoy it.  The frites were quite tasty and not too oily.  We also had more than enough cappuccinos throughout our brunch affair to ensure I had an energy high that would last me to the wee hours of the night.  We ordered 3 cappuccinos each.  But in my defense, the 3rd cappuccino was not my doing.  I was surprised by a cappuccino upon returning from the ladies room.  The first cappuccino was not up to par because the foam was very watery.    I had also come to Lola's with the intent on trying the Cheesecake Stuffed French Toast, but could not brave it alone.  Thank you Doctor!  The bread was eggy, though I found it to be a bit on the dry side.  I would've preferred a moister brioche.  The berry compote balanced out the sweetness of the cheesecake quite well.  I wish I had known there was a mini version ahead of time, as we were both pretty full after our mains, but couldn't say no to our sweet tooths!  Lola's Commissary is a quaint and cozy spot to have brunch.  We were undisturbed for our stay, except for the occasional checking up on how things were, and topping up our water glasses.  Lola's gets bonus points because the food was served piping hot, and they use nothing but fresh ingredients.  You can taste it in their food.  I would probably come back if I were in the neighbourhood, but wouldn't go out of my way for my brunch fix.  The menu offerings were pretty standard, nothing really impressive or out of the ordinary.  They do have a nice patio in the front which would be nice in the summer.  The bill at the end of the day was $71 excluding tip."}
{"text":"I was back here for brunch shortly after my first visit (see below) and thought it was fantastic! I walked in and was seated right away as I waiting for my two companions to join me on an outside patio table no less! As I was waiting a line up started to form -- lucky I beat the line! We were in the hot sun and ended up drinking a lot of water which is healthy for us haha. The service was timely, friendly and helpful. We had the shakshouka, mushroom Benny and breakfast bowl. While I enjoyed my Benny, I think next time I'll go for the bowl. It's not something you can get every brunch spot you visit. Neither is the shakshouka (although I would have made a total mess eating that one)! They had cheap mimosas (yum!) and the wait time for those in line didn't seem very long. Definitely will enjoy visiting again!  P.S - the brunch photos seem to be with the dinner review below. In case you wanna see these yummy meals!"}
{"text":"Lola's is one of my go-to spots for brunch or a casual dinner.  My brunch favourites are the granola, huevos rancheros and shakshuka.  For dinner, I love the broccoli and cauliflower appetizer and the California bowl.  I have also tried the veggie burger and curry but I never regret ordering the California bowl, which is big enough for left overs.  I appreciate that the menu has many healthy options and can easily accommodate vegans and allergies.  If I have some extra room, they usually have a good selection of vegan cupcakes and cakes, which are always a hit.  The patio is a great spot but it fills up fast on a nice day.  Service is always attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"The wonderful friendly host who greeted us, seated us on the patio and offered my kids some paper and crayons. Their brunch menu was really good - they serve organic eggs, fresh fruit juices, and  have gluten free options. The food was good and the portions were a good size.   My only complaint was that we were served our meals over 15 minutes after several other groups who were seated after us. We have little kids it would have been nice if they could have served us before the people who arrived later than us."}
{"text":"The food is below par. Ordered Lola's brunch and Lola must have had a long night. Bacons were completely burn to crisp. Home fries were charcoaled to the point I didn't recognize they were potatoes! Two eggs, I asked for over easy and got sunny side up! The only thing resembled to edible was the tiniest piece of toast I got. We also ordered strawberry watermelon sangria. It must have been non alcoholic because none of us tasted any alcohol! Btw if you were going to use frozen  strawberries, please don't mark it up as fresh! Don't even get me started on the service, if the food was good I won't complain about the dismal service. Unfortunately that is not the case for Lola's kitchen."}
{"text":"I really like this place! Usually I'm left feeling empty after eating a salad but not this place! They really fill it with a lot of healthy and yummy ingredients. I especially love their kale salad and the santa fe, both are really filling with a wonderful dressing. You are left feeling full and energized! No feeling guilty after eating at this place.  Only complaint is that the food comes very slowly, we sat there for over 30 minutes and it still didn't come."}
{"text":"Amazing! I had a kale saladwith grilled tofo.  It was filling and delicious.  Bf had the chickpea almond nurger with fries.  He was very impressed. Server very friendly and attentive. Would go again."}
{"text":"I came here for a quick lunch with my dad, waited around 10 minutes for a table to free up, but boy was it worth the wait.  For under $20+tip a person this is the best meal I've had in the area.  I ate the Israeli cous-cous with chicken.  My dad had the lamb burger with butternut squash soup. I couldn't resist the urge to have a bite of the burger, both meals where absolutely perfect.  Couldn't recommend this place enough, definitely try it out if you're looking for an average priced meal around yonge and bloor.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I found this place by typing \"vegan\" and filtering for a full bar.  At first glance their menu is mainly vegetarian / grass fed meat / gluten free with few vegan sides and salads. But I asked the waitress if I can veganize their black bean burger and she gladly did. The burger comes with a side of choice. I went with the fries. It was delicious. Filling but not greasy. Service was very friendly.  Overall a nice place to eat."}
{"text":"I probably expected too much from Lola's Kitchen given the high ratings from fellow Yelpers and because my b/fast companion has brunch here on a semi-regular basis.   I walked here from the St. Lawrence Market area on a scorcher of a morning Aug long, arriving drenched in sweat. Needless to say, I forgoed the patio for air-conditioning! I liked the homey feel of the place and the attentive service (not a stretch given that business was pretty slow!).   My friend and I noticed a discrepancy on our menus and we pointed this out to our server who said that my friend had an older menu featuring a french toast that was no longer offered. My friend was a bit disappointed since she's not a fan of the available french toast (cheesecake stuffed). I asked if a substitution could be made (tomato/avocado) for the bacon on the Eggs Benny, but our server said that this would be extra. I opted for the 'shoom Benny. It would've been nice for the server/restaurant to be a bit more accomodating, given that we were there on a slow long weekend.   In any case, my Benny was decent. I was a bit disappointed that it was served on a regular English muffin and not a biscuit as noted on the menu, but I didn't protest. It featured a decent qty of mushooms and caramelized onions. Lola's potatoes were alright. I liked the sweet potatoes, but the regular potatoes were a bit undercooked.   In conclusion, I would say that this is a decent brunch spot, but there are definitely better, more accomodating places in the city!"}
{"text":"Wow, My friend made an interesting observation about my last review. I was here exactly one year ago to this day (may 15th) !! how weird and creepy!  I was able to make a reservation for 4 quite easily (highly recommended!) We were welcomed by friendly servers who gave us drinks and coffee. (note: they also have mimosas, but it's not on the menu).   The food has lots of variety and very substitute and veggie friendly. I got the Brunch bowl, which was new and sweet potatoes, with cheese, chorizo, onion and an egg on top.  yum.   I did ask about the secret mini version of the french toast , half portion, but he said that they didn't have it on weekends. But I guess things evolve after a year. That was disappointing.   Otherwise, another go to brunch place."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch a few weeks ago and then back for dinner the following week. Enjoyed the variety of healthier \"different\" brunch and dinner options which included kale and quinoa bowls. For our brunch dessert we shared the vegan coconut cream cupcake which was one of the best cupcakes I've ever had (including non-vegan options)! For our dinner dessert we had the vegan carrot cake, which was only mediocre. Service was great both visits, portions were good and we left satisfied.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Found this place one Sunday am through a search on yelp.  Went about 2 hrs later. Loved it. Staff was amazing. Food was terrific. Helped with hangovers. :)  It seemed like just the right amount of greasy and healthy. A neighbourhood place.  Like most Brunchy places. The line up can be long. Although we waited only about 10 minutes at the bar. Where 3 of the staff each asked how we were doing. How great is that- they were just being friendly on a Sunday am"}
{"text":"I like that this is one of the few brunch places in the city that has both omnivore and vegan brunch options and really want to be able to recommend it to people, but unfortunately the vegan options are lacklustre given the array of good vegan brunch places in Toronto.   The tofu scramble is made with curried powder instead of an egg-y seasoning, and it has no flavour beyond that curry powder. There's so much of it too, it gives the scramble a pasty texture. The beans that come with it were dry and also not very flavourful.  On my next visit, I tried the gluten-free crepes. They come with maple syrups and coconut whip, but the batter had cumin seeds mixed into it which made for a strange combo. The others in my party who also ordered this dish were all unhappy with it and none of us were able to finish.  They really need to do away with the Indian cuisine inspired brunch items. People who want vegan brunch still want traditional items without the animal products. There's no need to re-invent the wheel. Places like The Steady have it figured out with items like a tofu benny but Lola's still needs work.  The service is good but when I was there most recently we were sort of rudely warned that we couldn't stay more than 2hrs. This is at about 10:15am and they had just opened and most of the tables were empty. I get that it will get busier later but telling people there's a time limit on their stay when they have just sat down and you have empty tables is straight up tacky.  Atmosphere-wise, the decor is late-90s modern and the front room is dim because of black out curtains over the windows during the day."}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for ages and today we thought we'd give it a try for brunch. We waited just a few minutes for a table for 4 on the main floor.   Inside is nice, wonderful art on the walls, great finishes everywhere. Very friendly staff, always going the extra mile for your needs.  They had a special on Mimosa's so we had to have a couple. I think I had 1 too many.   We had the mushroom Benny (outstanding), brunch bowl (very tasty), eggs Benny with salad (bill said the hollandaise sauce  was a lite vinegary), and the eggs & bacon with fries and it was very tasty).   We would all come back again for sure. Very good !!!"}
{"text":"Lola's is one of my favourite spots - I have been here for both dinner and brunch.  1) The staff is always very friendly, personable and helpful. The service is great. One time something ran out in the kitchen, and the server was SO apologetic. It seems that the staff really cares about the business and the customer having a positive experience.  2) I love the great mix of food - so many awesome vegan and veggie options as well.  3) The food is great and the price point is excellent. The ambiance is nice, without being pretentious - a very laid back and comfortable experience.   4) Even when its slam packed, I don't feel like a sardine as I sometimes do in other busy brunch spots. The layout is well designed.   I have tried many things of the menu - never had a bad experience here!"}
{"text":"Amazing brunch options(vegan, gluten free and vegetarian options) sat on the terrace, friendly staff and filling food. Came out happy and satisfied. Tried the tofu scrabble and it was perfection"}
{"text":"I took a pretty large group of people into this place. I have to say I loved the place! The food was excellent, and the service was great. I asked for Eggs Benny with a slice of tomato instead of bacon and they made it for me. The hollandaise was tasty without being overtly rich, the eggs were cooked to perfection, the soup it came with was a butternut squash soup which was absolutely fabulous! I would totally recommend this place to anyone looking for an awesome brunch place in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Twas my birthday and on the strength of some recommendations of not touristy trap places to dine, we decided to check out Lola's.  It was raining, it was pride, it was jazz fest, but right in the center of it all was Lola's with a great staff full of pride and ready to please.  Decor-located in what looks like it used to be an old house, Lola's occupies the first floor.  The decor was standard, hard wood floors, tables, and some pretty unique art on the wall.   Staff- super friendly, very energetic, and fun.  A touch slow on the coffee refills, but that's being nitpicky.   Food:  Lord have mercy that breakfast sandwich was good.  Following in what seems to be quite the trend in Toronto, the burger was hand formed, which I love.  The imperfection of the shape without being mashed and rounded into a perfect circle gives you a bit of the at home feeling and I can't explain why it tastes better but it just does.  The sandwich came with fries or home fries, I opted for the latter.  Perfect.  A little crisp on the outside, but still plenty of great potato texture on the inside.  I don't know what combination of sauces was on that bun, but that along with the perfect sunny side egg....well it was delicious albeit a little messy.  The bottom bun got soaked and soggy, but fabulous nevertheless."}
{"text":"Always in search of a healthy place to eat out, I found Lola's Kitchen after sifting through a few Google searches.   What caught my eye about Lola's was the fact that it is not a totally vegan restaurant. I'm not sure why blogs and reviewers seem to equate 'vegan' with 'healthy.'   Anyway, Lola's menu had meat, fish, and vegetable options and looked diverse. Also a full bar and cocktail list. Most earthy-vegetable-type places don't have cocktails, just juice and smoothie.  There is an upstairs and a downstairs here. We were seated upstairs. It was quiet and like the geriatric section. Downstairs seemed to have more of a vibe. Upstairs it SUCKED in terms of atmosphere. There was a friendly server up there occasionally, but it was slow. There was no background music AT ALL and just a couple tables of 60-70+ aged people. Mood killer. Much as you don't think atmosphere can ruin a meal, believe me it can. And by putting us in the crap section, I was already in a bad mood. And they didn't put anyone else upstairs either, so it remained totally empty and dull the whole night.  Food - portions are average to big. I just got a salad because I was irritated. It was adequate and seemed fresh. The cocktail had nearly zero alcohol in it. I get it - they were on special ($1 full dollar off. Wow.) - but don't skimp on ingredients!  The atmosphere was so low that we skipped dessert and quickly got out of there. I'm not going back. Maybe my review would have been different if they put us in a populated section of the restaurant with some energy. The upstairs should not even be open at a non-busy time. Thumbs down. In a city like Toronto with tons of fun places, the upstairs of Lola's Kitchen is the worst place ever."}
{"text":"Ambience (indoors) was really nice and the service was great.  As for the food.. I had the short ribs and frites.  The meat was succulent and fell right off the bone.. pretty good flavor as well.  The accompaniments were just weird though.  Firstly, the fries were arguably the worst I've ever been served.  Just a wilty luke-warm mess.  They were also covered in some sort of green semi-fried garnish that just did nottt suit the dish.  My date had the chickpea veggieburger and salad and she seemed content, albeit not glowing with praise.  2.5/5"}
{"text":"I came here for a company lunch as I've heard good things about it.  I ordered the curried chickpea and almond burger (minus the lime yogurt) with fries.    Best veggie burger I've had in a while.  A lot of places burn the patty but this one was just right. It was crispy without the burnt taste.  And the fries...holy shite.  They gave me so many!  When I saw the price of burger and fries at $15, I thought it was pricey, but for the portion and quality it was great.    In terms of atmosphere, it's two floors, but a bit loud.  Sort of like a bar atmosphere.  Service = pretty good.  Verdict: I think it's good for a company lunch and a special treat once in a while."}
{"text":"High quality, well made food. Great ingredients and a good chef make what is really an ordinary menu quite delicious. I would give this a 5-star if it had a more diverse and interesting (not necessarily bigger) menu. Service is friendly. It's busy at lunchtime...so make a reservation."}
{"text":"Fantastic! I travel all the way from Los Angeles to Toronto and I get the California Bowl. It was really tasty. The woman working there - never got her name - was awesome. I asked how the veggie burger was and she said, \"it's okay....\" Then i asked how the CA Bowl was and she said, \"it's really good\" - so i went with it plus a side of awesome fries with homemade ketchup. I did take out. But the the room looked cosy and the service was great. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Favourite go to for a nice and healthy meal. Love the kale Caesar salad with tofu or chicken added. Fresh juice daily is amazing! Portions are great with good value for your money. Special pouting is delicious! Highly recommend for craves of something savoury. Frequent visitor and always a good experience!"}
{"text":"I'm quite impressed! I came here twice this past weekend. I actually had Winterlicious reservations but had to cancel them as I had a stomach bug and so wanted something simple. We chose Lola's because they had a great vegetarian/vegan selection. I got a salad with spinach, quinoa, avocado, garlic, sundried tomatoes, and a cranberry vinaigrette. It was incredibly fresh, had loads of interesting ingredients and was the first thing I could eat in like 2 days so I could not be happier with my choice. Our waitress told us they were most famous for their brunch which is why we returned the next day.  I had the mushroom benny with goat cheese and for the most part, it was amazing. The mushrooms were fresh, high quality, and plentiful and blended so well with the tastes of the spinach, goat cheese, and well-made hollandaise and perfectly poached eggs. The english muffin itself was hard to cut into, maybe a little burnt. Also, the home fries had a spice I was not a fan of at all. Their regular fries however are amazing, as I had some of my date's with their home-made ketchup (a $1 addition) which was also really cool.   We came at 10am so got a table easily but this place was filling up fast and clearly gets quite busy for Brunch so reservations are probably recommended!"}
{"text":"The food was okay but the service wasn't the best. The wait time was longer than expected. I understand that we went during busy time (Saturday brunch) but our server didn't bother checking up on us. The coffee was meh and had grounds at the bottom, and the milk must have been expired since it had curds in it.   Wouldn't recommend!"}
{"text":"Went here a handful a times for both brunch and dinner. Their brunch is better than dinner in my opinion, with my favourites being their Eggs Rancheros, Brunch Bowl and Mushroom Benny. Their frites are also really, really good.   For dinner, I usually gravitate towards the Short Rib Poutine. Even though it's an appetizer, I still find it pretty filling. Their Squash (stuffed with brown rice, cauliflower, cranberries etc. drizzled with maple syrup) is also really good if you're wanting something sweet - though not filling enough for dinner. Their Burger and Rajan's Lamb Curry is also quite good (though the curry is a little spicy).   Service is always very good and they're really accommodating for people on special diets or food restrictions.   Recommended!"}
{"text":"Came for the cheesecake-stuffed french toast, but was more wowed by the fritata - spinach and mushroom and sun blush tomato and the most delicious soft goat cheese, in generous clumps on top. Oh. My. God. AMAZING!  Service was also super. Atmosphere was lovely and lively. Mmmmmmmmm...."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago, a Sunday in December, was my birthday. Since I'm older than Methusela, I decided that instead of going out and drinking way past my bedtime, I would force my closest friends to wake up at the crack of dawn on a weekend and join me for brunch and hate me for it later.  Unfortunately, Lola's is one of the 99% of Toronto brunch places that do not accept reservations. I sort of understand why, but I have a feeling that it would not affect business either way, considering Toronto crowds happily line up to wait. Should even a large group not show up for their reservations, the restaurant would still find the same number of patrons they would without having made the reservations, despite their having to hold the table for at least 10-15 minutes. In sum - it's frustrating when people don't cancel their reservations, but surely they would make up the difference by adding customers who don't eat where they can't reserve.   Bigtime digression! I had a large party + a couple kids, and was worried about seating - my wonderful girlfriend worked it out with them over the phone, and they said show up when we open and we'll seat you. So we did.  Most of us arrived around 10, and we were seated upstairs, in what I presume is their standard \"kids department\" (the other tables up there also had parents and children alike) and we set to ordering. My GF and I shared the breakfast kale bowl, and an Eggs Rancheros. The dishes were full of complex flavour and enjoyable texture.   The kale bowl, with its combination of quinoa, red onion, leek, and kale was wonderfully crunchy and wholesome. As a serial cereal consumer, the bowl featured all the snap, crackle, pop, [insert onomatopoeia] noises I equate with morning pleasantness.   The Huevos were served in a tortilla bowl, with a mix of standard, well-executed items: guacamole, pico de gallo, lime yogurt, salsa verde, and cheese. No complaints!   All in all, it was a positive birthday experience for me. I am really happy they were able to accommodate my friends' kids, who were no angels (unless you count the snow angels they were making in the middle of the hallway as servers struggled to get by)."}
{"text":"Steady line out the door on weekends waiting for a great brunch. Call ahead to be added to the waiting list.  Beautiful interior, delicious food variety, and excellent service.  The coffee is fresh and hits the spot. The salad side option has a great mix of veggies."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty, if a little pricey. Try the sexy potatoes!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is nice and cozy. The good is pretty good and the menu is vegetarian friendly. If you like healthy but tasty food, this place is for you."}
{"text":"I read a few yelp reviews before coming here for dinner, so I was half dreading about the poor service and half expecting the \"invisible\" treatment (check out some of the reviews below to see what I mean). And trust me, I have had a similar \"invisible treatment\" before so I understand what the others were talking about, and it definitely sucks to be treated like 2nd class for no valid reason.  But I am happy to say that the waitress we interacted with was friendly, accommodating and attentive. The food was amazing! I ordered the grilled chicken with poutine (add $3.25). Portion was generous, everything was made with fresh ingredients, presentation was immaculate.   If I could give .5, I would have given Lola's a 4.5/5. The reason being: one of our friends ordered a ginger beer and we sat in the patio. There were bees hovering her drink the entire time. Half way through, two bees decided to swim inside her half-full ginger beer bottle. The waitress offered to give her another ginger beer promptly. My friend asked the waitress if she could just cancel the drink off our bill, and she simply complied with no fuss. :)"}
{"text":"I'm not as impressed as many peoplw with this restaurant. First impression was the hostess who greeted me at the door. She was fantastic and friendly and felt genuine. Ok, things are starting well! Waited for a patio seating and walked around the inside of the restaurant to see what it looked like. Was very pleasantly surprised at how spacious and well decorated the interior was. Very nice restaurant on an aesthetics level.   I got my table on the patio and was served by a waiter who was less enthusiastic than the hostess. Ordered my food and waited quite sometime for my food which was the curry tofu scramble with toast. In the voice of UFC's Mike Goldberg \"here we go\":  #1-the curry on the tofu was flavourless. As in, it tasted like the chef poured curry all over the tofu with NO other seasonings at all. Hence, an overpowering curry taste that was flavourless....hard to imagine I know but that's the best description I can give. #2-\"the toast\" was some dry pieces of flaxseed bread that was NOT toasted. I mean, toast means crispy warm bread right?? So to moisten my palate on this dry meal I ordered strawberry jam for my \"toast\"... #3-the strawberry jam was THE worst jam I've ever had in my entire life. It was completely flavourless, did not taste like jam and had whole chunks of strawberries that was not spreadable on my dry a$$ bread. It was pale in colour and looked quite off. #4-when the uninspired waiter cleaned our tables he dropped what goo was left from my jam and got it alll over my Luis Vuitton purse  (yeah first world problems but I work hard for my money and like to reward myself). He didn't even apologize and I had to ask for napkins to wipe my purse off...still no apology. #5-and after splattering the goo on my purse with no apology the waiter had the nerve and audacity to present the bill with the tip percentages worked out for me. Oh so nice and courteous of him.....not. Dirty the customer but pay me my tips.  So yeah, maybe other people like this food because it's not overly spiced and caters to vegans and vegetarians and that's cool. But if you like spice or even a bit of flavour in your food this place is not for you. I left extremely disappointed as I had such high hopes from the Yelp reviews and my initial interaction with the hostess. Oh well...."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that the food was really good. The service on the other hand, was a disaster. It took over 15 minutes for anyone to even come over after we got seated, then another 10 for an orange juice and coffee. The server was nice enough, but really, like 30 minutes for a coffee? What's with this city and bad service at vegetarian/vegan restaurants, I feel like it's a trend, and not one I am a fan of."}
{"text":"My husband and I went Lola's Kitchen on a Sunday for brunch. We ordered an Egg Rancheros and Mushroom Benny. A lot of their menu items can be gluten free or vegan options. The rancheros I had was a bit spicer than I expected but it tasted great. Mushroom Benny was done to the perfection. The service was great, we got seated right away and didn't wait long for beverage not food. Environment was good, they had a patio space that is really popular and we choose to sit inside but it was cozy. In general, we enjoyed our experience at Lola's kitchen !"}
{"text":"Service: A+++ Sunday Brunch:  C Restaurant Atmosphere, decor: A-  Overall:  C+  My wife and I took 4 friends out to lunch.  The food was mediocre - every item we ordered.  Even the fries were bad - overdone and dry.   Portions were very small on top of being mediocre in taste.   Maybe menu that is not part of Sunday brunch is better.  If I were you, I would stay away from Sunday Brunch.   The waitress you served us was gracious, pleasant and top notch.  LEE"}
{"text":"I came here for a quick brunch, it's a nice environment to take refuge from an early morning work schedule. The staff and customers were nice, and it's got a home feeling, so eating was an enjoyment."}
{"text":"Great vegan bowls, high quality ingredients, never leave hungry. One of the best places in this area. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out for brunch - I live just a block away. First impression was great - patio with good vibes and a really friendly hostess. Funky music playing in the background - I was impressed!  Decided to try their cranberry cider. Extremely tart. Good thing I had some splenda on me that somewhat saved the drink but it was still quite yucky. Service was pretty slow and food took a long time to arrive. The waiter seemed very uninterested about his job. I decided to have mushroom benny. I hate to say it, but this was the most bland food I've ever had in Toronto. I really wanted to like this place. Hollandaise sauce was absolutely tasteless. I don't know how that's even possible considering the ingredients. Fries were oily and tasteless. Maybe the appeal of this restaurant is for people that dislike spices. I don't know. The fact that there's a charge for hot sauce, garlic and ketchup in their menu supports this theory.  The portion was small and I was hungry 2 hours after eating. I would rate the food at this place 0 stars and ambiance 3 stars - the ambiance didn't end up being as nice as I initially thought because the tables outside are placed so close together that you have zero privacy when having a conversation. I sat next to a loud girl that yapped loud non-stop with no breaks and pretty much drove me crazy."}
{"text":"Came here with the Husband and Grumpy Father-in-Law for breakfast this rainy morning, and thought the food was delicious. I had the maple pecan french toast which was just the perfect sugar rush to kickstart my day. I also have to give kudos to the service; our server was quite nice and accommodating, even when faced with having to deal with Grumpy Pop before his morning coffee.   I'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Great brunch options, decent portion sizes, and lots of vegan/vegetarian/gluten free options (menu is also very customizable if you request). Downside is it can be hit or miss. My vegan tofu scramble brunch main was a definite hit - much bigger than I expected and the flaxseed bread was so yummy! Lol that bread was probably my favorite. You get a choice of salad, home fries, or something else, and I would recommend the salad as even though it's only greens the dressing (balsamic vinegarette?) makes up for it completely. The black beans were super spicy, but filling. The tofu scramble had caramelized onions and spinach. It was good too, but the dominating flavor was salty, and was too oily imo.   The croque champignon, which came with bacon I think, looked kind of disappointingly simple and small. A miss if based purely on aesthetics. Not sure about the taste though.  $6 mimosas and fresh fruit juices here for brunch.  We didn't make a reservation despite coming as a group of 4 on a beautiful Sunday at peak hours, but was seated immediately.  Child friendly too - high chairs are available :)"}
{"text":"Love this place!   It's a short walk from the Yonge and bloor station. Came here on a Friday morning for brunch and the restaurant is pretty packed. I suggest making a reservation prior coming.  We ordered two frittata and they were amazing! Highly recommend everyone to come try it out :)."}
{"text":"Had the brunch bowl which was like eating a cream cheese bagel,  pulled pork sandwich, and vegetable soup all at once. Sounds weird,  but it works! Bonus points for being ballsy enough to not serve espresso and Americanos on the weekends."}
{"text":"A great place to grab some great gluten free fare. I love going to this place for breakfast. The dinners are good as well. It's always a pretty plate. The flavours are fresh. And the menu is always being updated. It's a bit pricey for what you get. But believe me you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"California bowl was amazing.   Very calm relaxing atmosphere.   Quick efficient service."}
{"text":"I need to come in during brunch because those egg bennies and kale breakfast bowls look so tasty!! I went in for a late lunch and got myself the curried lamb. It was really good - would've been perfect for colder weather though. Staff were friendly. Would be down for coming back again for brunch!"}
{"text":"Came here for Saturday brunch and had 'Lola's Breakfast' & a mimosa. The food was pretty great but the portions were small and there was quite the wait since the kitchen was backed up. Cute place but nothing special."}
{"text":"Off the bat, let's just admit that Lola's is a GREAT brunch spot. We've eaten at several places in Church-Wellesley and unfortunately hadn't found a brunch spot that we just loved. We hadn't been to Lola's yet so we decided to swing in for a late Saturday breakfast/brunch.   Lola's is inside of an adorable old house so the charm starts when you walk in the door. We were seated in the back room on the lower floor, right next to the big painted brick wall which I decided in my head is a painting of the infamous \"Lola\". Our server was really friendly and attentive. We started with coffee and mimosas while scouring the mouthwatering menu.  I opted for the simple Lola's Breakfast with scrambled eggs, toast, sweet potato home fries, and bacon. Lola's is vegetarian friendly but I certainly didn't go that route on this day. The food was fresh, flavorful, and delicious. The ingredients here are wholesome with many local items.   In the end, we really enjoyed our meal. It was a great spot to sit an plan out the rest of our day and people watch. It was a tad cool for the patio but I'm sure it's a nice spot to enjoy a summer mimosa. Next time when we're in town, we'll be sure to return to Lola's."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch the food is all organic and is prepared delicious. I has two Caesars virgin and they were amazing. It was all great good for family good for everybody. A little piece of advice call before to reserve or you  are in for a long wait."}
{"text":"After a Saturday morning if viewing condos in the nearby neighbourhoods, we yelped a nearby brunch spot and Lola's looked like a good pick. There weren't any lines at the time we decided to go (at around 11:30am Saturday) which is a big plus for me at brunch time when our stomachs start growling.  We were seated pretty quickly upstairs and service was quite quick and efficient without being overbearing and checking in every 5 minutes. Our orders were mushroom Benny, eggs rancheros, and the shakshouka. I personally had the mushroom Benny and it was excellent, mushrooms were cooked perfectly! Their home fries were also well done as well, but if you're feeling up for a lighter side, they do offer salads as an option. We glanced at the other tables being healthy while we gorged on their potatoes and our sides of extra bacon. The others in my group were not too happy with their meals quoting the eggs rancheros as \"meh\" and the shakshouka as \"too tomatoey\". Other than that, if I'm ever in the area I would return to Lola's for brunch. Worthy of stopping by if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Ratings: Food: 6/10 Drink: 9/10 Service: 9/10 Value: 6/10 Hygiene: 9/10 Aesthetics: 7/10  I came here for brunch on Sunday. I had heard quite a bit of positive things so we had to give this place a try.  A few of us ended up getting the brunch bowl and one of us got the mushroom benny. I added a side of home fries after looking at the portions from adjacent tables.   The brunch bowl was absolutely mediocre, the eggs over-cooked at the bottom and undercooked on top. The rib meat was flavorless and bland. The greens were old and bitter. One of the egg bennies was overcooked, so they replaced it with a proper poached egg.  Their fresh juices are pretty tasty, but they are on the expensive side.  The place looks pretty tacky on the inside and decor is not my favorite.  The service is good and they're courteous and polite.   It's not a bad place for brunch, but I can think of many other places that do a better job."}
{"text":"Awesome place, good food and great service. I went there with my friends and the brunch was really good. Their freshly squeezed juice was also quite nice.   A must try place for weekend brunch!"}
{"text":"Amazing brunch !!! I had the burger with fries it was amazing, it had a sunny side up egg on top of the patty and gave it a great balance and really good taste !  My hubby ordered the huevos rancheros and were delicious too.  We also had coffee (nice and strong)  And at last we had the cookie of the day (cashew cookie) was vegan and gluten free (and was surprisingly good)  It was an overall great experience. We'll be back for sure.  It gets busy so arrive early."}
{"text":"Sunday was my second time here and I'll still be back for more.   Decor is fabulous. Seriously, a renovated mansion for your brunching pleasure? Awww, yeahhh. Plus, the bathrooms (located upstairs) are marvelous. Uhm, they smell good too! (Srsly!)  I gots zee 'Shroom Benny, baby! Poached eggs to perfection, ;). Oh, but it wouldn't have been the same without those plentiful wild mushrooms! So, so good. My friend's straight up French toast was simplistic (as implied by its namesake) but lovely. Last time I had the chance to nibble on the cheesecake stuffed French Toast which is a decadent indulgence. I'd love to get a mini one to share with another, :D.   I want to try the Eggs Lola next! So, I'll see you soon, Lola's Commissary!"}
{"text":"Great little lunch spot with really fresh salads and sandwiches. They have a lovely patio. A reason it's great for lunch is they move pretty quickly and don't waste your time. You can take a very civilized lunch break in a short time frame. With good food! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Visited here to celebrate my birthday and had the best lunch. I ordered the California bowl and loved the tanginess of the apple cider vinegar with the grilled tofu. The staff were great, I loved the art work around the restaurant and hope to visit again next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Looking for a brunch/lunch spot and definitely found it at Lola's! The delicious sounding menu made it difficult to choose, but we selected the shakshouka and the brunch burgers. Everything was absolutely amazing! One of us requested meal substitutions, which were graciously granted. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend at 11am on a Saturday for brunch (prime brunch time). The place was bustling and we took the last available table.  Their menu of fresh juices looked appealing over the bar, but I ordered coffee instead. The coffee was great.  There are lots of gluten free, vegetarian and vegan options.  I ordered the Shakshuka with a side order of fries. You have the option of picking fries or salad. I wanted carbs so I picked the fries. Shakshuka was a great breakfast choice (a little on the healthier side). The tomato and pepper base was perfectly tomatoe-y and flavoured. The eggs were on the runnier side, but that's how I like them in shakshuka. The bread was toasted and warm (used to soak up the tomatoe-y goodness).  I didn't mind the time limit - I had somewhere to be afterwards, so Lola's is a great place for a quick breakfast."}
{"text":"I would've gave it 4 stars. I've been here twice for brunch and the first time was amazing. The food was good. I ordered the mushroom Benny with frites and it was one of the best. The service was good. Our server was very nice and attending.   So I decided to return and this time is really why I'm giving it 1 star. And the star was just because the food was good. Most of the issues weren't with my personal dish, but the overall service.   My friend ordered the same dish but hers came without spinach. When we asked the server whether her dish should come with spinach, he pointed out the tiniest leaf on the side of her plate before saying he'll go and check and bring her a small side. It's almost as of accusing her of eating it.   Then as he was in the kitchen get if the spinach, my friend notices a large egg shell in her poached egg and we decide to let the server know when he returned. We even specifically told him we don't want he dish replaced or anything, but just an FYI and a comment to pass on. Instead of apologizing, he comments on how it's normal and it happens. Then almost insultingly says he'll add a discount on the bill.   Later, he comes back with the bill and its separated with the subtitles, he punches in one bill with a Caesar and hands it to a friend of mine. Each one of us had one drink and our drinks were in front of us. The friend he handed the Caesar bill to had a tea and the teapot was in front of her.   When I told him about the mistake, he once again didn't apologize. Instead, he notes it's only a dollar difference between all our bills. So rude, I contemplated giving close to nothing for tips, but the food was good and my dish didn't have any issue so I gave the average 15%. When I did take a look, the \"discount\" was 0.67 per bill. No offense, but I had to hold back scoffing and commenting. As if we needed the overall less than $2 discount.   It's not the amount between the bills that's the issue, it's not the egg shell or the missing spinach that's the issue. It's the service. If he had apologized about the spinach, the egg shell and the bill and made an attempt to rectify it instead of scoffing at us, he would've revived higher than average tip. It's not the errors made, it's how you handle them that makes all the difference. Overall, really disappointed and I won't be returning. It was good food, but I don't believe the food is enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"This place has really good Eggs Benedict and the home fries on the side were REALLY good!! I really recommend this place if you're craving some classic brunch food"}
{"text":"A brunch restaurant that takes reservations is just what I need! Especially when friends are coming in town and you don't want to be rude, picking a good place that may require waiting in line in the chilly weather for..... say 45 minutes at minimum?  From the outside, you would never expect to venture into such a beautiful interior - full of colour, artwork, and a beautiful little chandelier hanging at the top by the front, facing the bay window. Separated by a fireplace like wall, the two sides showcases a different character - i think the back more artsy, the front more modern.  At 11, the place was pretty much full and we got our table at the very back. We were offered little rice krispy treats to start off our lovely morning. what a nice add-in!  Reading about the stuffed french toast... and being the french toast / pancake type of girl, it would be a waste to pass up on it, even though I didn't feel like something super sweet......... the compote of the day was apple/cranberry and it was convincing enough for me to stick with my decision... but petite size.  That thing sure wasn't petite, that's for sure. Two thick slices of toast, with a very thin, but reasonable slice of cheesecake, topped with a load of compote, every bite was breakfast and dessert in my mouth! Thank goodness the cheesecake was not any thicker or it would have been too heavy. the compote was a great substitute for syrup, which i absolutely love to drench in, but not needed. I also got a side salad that came in a fairly large bowl, and dressed perfectly (in my mind, it is ever so lightly, but that's my personal preference).  S got the brunch bowl, which in his mind, was just okay, although it looked like a work of art - with sweet potatoes, sauteed onions, mushrooms, sausage, and two eggs on top like a giant feast. I took a bit and thought it was very tasty!  By the time we left at 12:30, the place was jamming - loud noise, great conversation, big parties, and a line up huddled around the doorway... guess the people who don't go to queen / king scurry to Lola's.. not a bad choice."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the brunch at this restaurant. They had $6 mimosas and $6 ceasers. You can opt in for a variety of freshly squeezed juices with your mimosa. They accommodated vegetarians and gluten sensitivities. Definitely go early because you can expect a line up after 11am."}
{"text":"Nice hipster spot with fresh / natural ingredients. The poutine was one of the best that I've had in TO."}
{"text":"*3.5*  i really really wanted to fall in love w lola's . it looks so nice from the outside, with its perfect 2 leveled patio and all .  the boos; my raspberry icetea was VERY very VERY bland and watered down and the sexy potatoes (i dont think theyre called that anymore .. it just said potatoes on the menu . meh) was nothing special and def not sexy . the sweet potato pieces were really mushy .  the good: we had the grilled cheese egg benny special . grilled cheese egg benny !! imagine all the possibilities ! but to my huge disappoitnment, it was just ... okay good . why couldnt they expand a little bit more on their amazing idea of grilled cheese egg benny ?! how about some avocados ? oh oh oh !!! carmalized onions under the cheese and a little bit of avocado salas/guac on top, hiding under that poached egg ?! how amazing would that have been ?! but that's just my wishful thinking . oh oh & the poached eggs ! why were they so overpoached ? there was no runny yolk !   the yum: cheesecake stuffed french toast . but i thought this was more like a dessert . it wasnt as AMAZING as i thought it'd be but it was still pretty damn delicious . i thought it was a little bit on the dry side . you can def taste the cheesecake in it . umm .. actually .. maybe i liked it more than i think i did . my mouth just started to water as im typing this . huh .  either way, i LOVE their patio and i guess my body is telling me that i love the stuffed french toast too so i'll def be coming back to give it a second try ."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant in an old, beautiful, old Victorian Mansion that has a nice patio  (not always open, unfortunately).  Large choice of meat-free options, even some vegan dishes ! It's good, decent portions, for decent prices. They also have a wide variety of drinks at night, but their fresh juices were disappointing.   I believe they are not always open, which can be a pain."}
{"text":"Great place to have brunch. But I've had better.  The service is mediocre, nothing pops out too much. Came here for brunch with my boyfriend and got a Benny. I don't much remember what was in it, so I guess it's not that memorable ... It's also a bit too pricey for the amount of food and the quality.   It's a cute place with a nice patio that overlooks Church St. Nice place to go, but definitely there are better options in Toronto."}
{"text":"I wanted to have a nice brunch with a friend and decided to make a visit here. The restaurant was nice in a very home-like interior and offered a variety of selections! I forget the name of the chicken sandwich I had but it also came with a poutine. The poutine had such a rich cheese curd and the gravy served with it went along very well. It came as a side with the sandwich and I was stuffed by the end of the meal!   Great service, would love to visit again :)"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now, their weekend brunch is fantastic, the mushroom benny in particular is really good :) better than the benedict! The service is good they're really nice and helpful, the place itself has great ambience and is comfortable. They also have a patio.   I love their selection of vegan/veggie food as well as meat/burgers, as I enjoy both types! Would definitely suggest it. The cheesecake stuffed french toast is actually not as good as I thought it would be but their food is superb and I would happily try another dessert!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now. I'm not sure what the hype is all about. It's a nice enough place, but I think the reason it is so popular may be because there is a serious lack of good brunch options around Yonge and Bloor. Every time I've been it has been packed to the brim. For the most part it's all standard brunch fare. They do have a French Toast Cheesecake which is absolutely insane, so I have to give them props for that. They also server sexy potatoes (which are a mix of normal and sweet potatoes) that are also quite good. That said, the last time I went they served my cousin orange juice so bitter it bordered on undrinkable. We're both so adverse to confrontation he drank it anyway. It's a nice enough space to meet for a meal."}
{"text":"I have already eat here 4 times, all business meetings and I'll keep coming. The place has 2 storeys and the decor is nice. The concept is for you too eat well, fresh, health and yummy. In my point of view they did it all very well! The have a good selection of plates and juices. The order also don't take too long, which is great for business meetings (also not a fast food)."}
{"text":"I've been craving the stuffed french toast like mad, and finally came back for lunch today with my bf and friend.  I was very happy to see that Lola's is now open for dinner (due to popular demand!)    I ordered the petite french toast, the shroom pizza and an americano.    The americano was perfect and hit the spot.  The espresso machine was great and made it very frothy.    The french toast was perfect as ever and topped with fresh berries.  I started with that b/c I just couldn't wait any longer.  I ate the pizza second.  The crust was nice and light, and the pizza wasn't too saucy.  It was covered in delicious mushrooms.  I had enough to take a slice home for a snack later as well.    The waiter was phenomenal.  I thought we were going to be forgotten b/c we had to be seated upstairs b/c it was really busy.  We absolutely were not.  He checked on us frequently, was quick with our orders and best of all he was really funny.    Next time I'm going to try the tacos!"}
{"text":"A myriad of good reviews can be found for this Church street spot. I am glad to add another one into the mix!  Before heading out, I knew from reading reviews that this place is busy during the weekends for brunch so I made a reservation. It is not available through open table just a direct call or email. Points for how quickly they respond! My friends don't respond to my emails as fast as these folks.  Service was fast and friendly.  Everything tasted fresh!  I was pleasantly surprised on its perfect potatoes with a standard breakfast. It didn't taste heavy or greasy. Delicious!  We left there satisfied by the all round quality of food, service and price.  A definite star on Church Street and should not be missed."}
{"text":"It was my last day visiting a friend in Toronto so I asked her to choose a nice brunch place where I could treat as my thank you gift. I was impressed by the service and decor of the place. Great fresh squeezed oj, tasty coffee, delicious salad that I chose to go with my eggs and bacon (Lola's Breakfast)."}
{"text":"I loved this little place! Such a cute feel and a cool vibe in Toronto. Was visiting the city for an appointment with my husband and I originally sought out a \"vegetarian\" friendly place to eat and then ended up eating something different. The service was seriously quick and our food came out seriously quicker! I was so impressed! My eggs were cooked perfectly and my little potatoes had just the right amount of crunch.   I will definitely visit again so I can try something that was not breakfast related - I just love breakfast food and eggs - haha!   The only thing that wasn't so great was that the washrooms were actually freezing! I immediately regretted having to go. But hey, it was a snowy and cold day outside so whatever!   I did also see a second floor with a bar upstairs which looked pretty neat - will have to check that out next time too! Overall, cute place with great food and service - check it out!!"}
{"text":"It wasn't terrible, but it also definitely didn't live up to the hype and did not justify the price tag. Service was acceptable but spotty, with our server not providing a teaspoon with my tea and also forgetting to get us our bill (we ended up having to ask another server for it 15 minutes later). Atmosphere and decor were nice, kind of renovated-loft-y feel with light wooden tables, metal chairs, and a few bright modern paintings lining the walls. Food honestly wasn't great. This place really doesn't compare to some of the better brunch places in Toronto like Le Petit Dejeuner, Mildred's, or Aunties and Uncles. Some of the seasoning choices and flavour combinations were pretty misguided, and really detracted from the dishes. I had the 'shroom benny (mushroom eggs benedict), and found that they tried to overcompensate for the under-caramelized onions by marinating the mushrooms in a really sweet sauce, which really wasted the flavour potential of the mushrooms in the dish. The sweetness should have all come from the onions, and the flavour of the mushrooms should have been brought out and enhanced instead of being covered up with sugar. It's especially a shame because I think a nice mushroom-y umami flavour would have balanced out the dish perfectly - it was lacking a touch of savouriness to balance out the creaminess and richness of the hollandaise.  My brunch partner had the eggs lola, which was described on the menu as chciken and poached eggs with avocado, pico de gallo, and sour cream on tortillas. It sounded like a chicken breakfast burrito, but came out more like a carnitas taco. The corn tortillas were soggy on the bottom and soaked through with sauce, making them impossible to pick up and mushy and flavourless to eat. The idea of making chciken into a carnitas-esque mash was seriously misguided. Some lightly-seasoned chicken breast cubes wouuld have gone much better with the other ingredients. As it was, the sauce from the chicken completely overpowered every other flavour in the dish - you couldn't make out the egg, the avocado, or even the sour cream. All you could taste was the sweet meaty flavour of the chicken carnitas. Also, I just think that making carnitas is just a bad use of chicken. I feel that the overpowering sweetness of carnitas sauce and the method of cooking the meat until it falls apart really requires the fattier, more pronounced pork flavour and also pork's more fibrous texture to be carried off well. You really need pork to balance out the sweetness of the sauce; otherwise it's just too sweet and unbalanced. So the chicken carnitas turned out unbalanced, too sweet, and too mushy, and was generally a fail. Also, the cutlery they use here is abominably balanced and thus super awkward too use - all the weight is at the back of the handle and you have to hold them very far back to keep them stable, and they are also not rotationally balanced, requiring a lot of gripping to prevent them from spinning in your hand back to their resting position."}
{"text":"This place was SO good. Came for Saturday brunch. Incredibly impressed. First the menu is local organic all meats are grass fed or pasture raised. Then the selection was incredible. Everything thing on the menu can be made gluten free or vegan. I LOVED my bowl - poached eggs, chorizo, kale, quinoa. My family members loved the Lola Breakfast of bacon and eggs with salad and home fries. We also loved the housemade granola. Overall this spot is delicious, filling, great atmosphere, ultra friendly staff, and so much attention to detail. So many places cut corners and Lola doesn't - their food quality is SO high. I had very high expectations because I knew that the food was organic and my expectations were met!!!"}
{"text":"I'm kind of disappointed in myself that I didn't order one of the more reputed dishes here, and instead opted for the standard grilled cheese. I just really wanted one that day. The cheese could have been melted more, which is causing me to withhold a star. Everything else was good, especially the sweet potato home fries.  I will be returning for the cheesecake-filled French toast."}
{"text":"When I lived in Yorkville I ate at Lola's at least once a week. For a celiac discovering this place was like uncovering paradise. These days, almost every restaurant in Toronto has gluten free options or at least some awareness of the issue. 8 years ago when I was first diagnosed as celiac, not so much.   Enter Lola's, a place where every food allergy and intolerance is taken seriously. This became my go-to spot with one of my roommates because it was one place in the city where neither of us had to order a salad! She is a vegetarian and I am celiac. It was so nice to be able to go out for dinner and be able to choose from a full menu of options - not just the two or three I could actually eat (side salad is not a gluten free dinner option - am I right?!).   Their burgers are fantastic - I always end up going back to the classic Lola's burger, but sometimes branch out and have the lamb burger. But, for me the real star of the show at lunch and dinner is their kale Caesar salad. With crispy frizzled leeks, crunchy capers, and huge polenta croutons (basically polenta fries going incognito in a salad) this is a gorgeous salad on it own. Add their roasted salmon fillet and a generous squeeze of lemon on top and you have one of the most consistently delicious plates in the neighbourhood. Heaven!  Lola's is best known around the city for brunch - where they also shine for their gluten free, vegan l, and vegetarian options. I am a fan of their mushroom Benny and think their home fries are on point. Coffee refills are few and far between unfortunately (a key criteria for a regular brunch spot) and they don't take reservations so expect a long awkward wait in the doorway.   Come to Lola's - it's comfortable, has something for everyone young and old, suits every dietary restriction and preference, and their dairy free cheesecake is incredible."}
{"text":"This is the top reviewed place for Sunday brunch in the downtown core. And there's a good reason why!   The ingredients are amazing, even though portions are not huge.  You can taste the local/organic in your mouth :)  They are also COMPLETELY gluten-free!  It is a bit pricey, but so are all top places.  The service could be more courteous, but it is quite passable.   Ultimately, the star rating is primarily for the quality of the food, including the quality of the ingredients, thus FIVE STARS!"}
{"text":"2-5 star food, 4 star service, good prices, very vegan friendly.  I personally think they deserve 4 stars overall.  Normally, I'll ignore other peoples opinions when writing a review, but in this case everyone else at the table -- 4 other people -- said they disliked their meal.  Since I picked the place to eat, of course I got the blame.  Passing that on to Lola's by knocking off a star.  I had a soup to start (4 stars), a vegan burger (2 stars), and a vegan cheesecake (5+ stars).  Best vegan cheesecake ever (and I've tried a lot) -- fluffy/creamy texture and great flavor.  The rest of the table had vegan burgers and fries -- hence their dislike of the place.  If they'd had the soup or cheesecake, they'd have left a lot happier.  If I went again, I'd skip the vegan burger and get a salad instead.  Service was good, friendly, and quick."}
{"text":"Very conscious menu, combined with fresh flavours and tasty options right down the street.  Never heard of/tried this place before but was recommended by a friend to check it out. Just looking at the menu online you can see lots of health-conscious and Dietary-restrictions friendly options with Vegan and Gluten Free items as well as special requests they'll accommodate.  The first thing that caught my eye is that they use Grass Fed beef for their burger, but I saw right under it a delicious looking Lamb Burger with combination of traditional Greek ingredients. I can say right now, it was very tasty. Great lamb flavour. Locally sourced and happy with the fact it was made gluten-free.   Pricing was fair under $20 so good to see that was an option. Would come back and try some of the other items, and look at visiting this place a little more given it's close to the Bloor street shopping areas with adequate street parking around available."}
{"text":"Great restaurant for both brunch and dinner...not many restaurants seem to be able to pull that feat off.  It's a comfortable neighborhood place with just the right amount of fancy to make it exciting, and enough comfort to go there on any old night.  The FOOD:  At brunch, their eggs benedict is usually spot on...really nice, fresh hollandaise sauce.  They have some good scrambles and always have something on the menu that's designed for vegetarians...it's not just a meat dish with the meat subtracted.     At dinner, I love their various bowls....vegetarian or with meat, they're always delicious.  Also very nutritious with a lot of ingredients like kale and quinoa.  They also do burgers for the pure meat folk (although I find it overly cooked).  Starters tend to be on the expensive side but are generally tasty.  They have a full bar, with expensive wines of nothing fancy.  The SERVICE: The staff have always been friendly, informed, and attentive.  I can't fault the consistent informal yet effective service.  The VIBE: I like the big open airy interior.  I also love the patio in summer.  OVERALL, Lola's is one of my favorite places to eat on this side of town.  It's a little more expensive, but generally worth it.    TIP: Brunch does not take reservations, so come early."}
{"text":"Great place with some nice brunch options. $5 mimosas were very cool. I had the brunch bowl which was quite satisfying and with a lot of different meats. Probably not good for very large groups since there will be a long wait particularly on the weekends."}
{"text":"My girl friends and I had another one of our monthly brunch outings again.  This time, we chose Lola's Kitchen because 1) it has local, sustainable foods, 2) it has vegan/vegetarian choices, and 3) the cheesecake stuffed french toast.  We were there on a Saturday morning at 11:30 AM - surprisingly not too packed, but as the the meal passed on, there were quite a lot of people.  I had ordered myself the following: pear + ginger iced tea, Eggs Rancheros, and a petite cheesecake stuffed french toast to share.  The pear and ginger iced tea was a slightly disappointment.  It was fairly watered down.  However, the Eggs Rancheros was a win.  With scrambled eggs, black beans, guacamole, tomatillo pico de gallo, and cheese in a hard tortilla shell - I was drooling.  Different from the other rancheros that I had previously at O&B and Smith, but I absolutely loved it.  The soup of the day was a butternut squash with a bit of chili.  The spicy kick to it just made it to die for.  Lastly, what we were all waiting for: the challah French toast with cheesecake.  Perhaps a lot of people were raving about it, that I had high expectations.  I found the French toast to be slightly on the dry side, and there just wasn't enough cheesecake!  Furthermore, the compote that we had was cherry.  It was a bit on the sour side, so it didn't seem like it matched well with the French toast.  All in all, it was a pretty good meal considering the main entree I had was delicious.  Service was awesome as well, and the place has a great ambiance.   Will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"It is normally illegal to receive oral pleasure like this in public, but of course I'm talking about Lola's Lamb Burger, Kale Ceasar Salad, and Blackberry-chery-ginger-lime fresh juice. I originally trekked out to this Church-Wellesley Village staple to get breakfast but found out that they only do brunch on the weekends. After a quick glance at the menu I realized I wouldn't be forlorn for long because their lunch menu is kick ass. An assemblage of vegetarian, vegan, and meat options, Lola's is truly friendly to all who enjoy great food. My waiter was super helpful and pointed me in the direction of what I ended up ordering. He even suggested adding seltzer water to the juice to give it some kick. The burger was perfectly flavored and succulent. The kale salad could make even the staunchest carnivore love veggies. Parts of it were toasted and the mixture of the different types of crunch was delightful. By the time I walked out I had also gotten a latte and a coconut-creme cupcake. I clearly could not get enough of this place. I wish I had more thumbs, but alas, a big 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Poor service great food. The 4 of us went for Sunday brunch. The food was amazing but our server was rude. We were sitting at 2nd floor by the window and she is the one taking our orders. When I checked with her how long will our food take after waiting for 20 mins, she sounds really pissed. I understand she might be having a bad day so she can't have a smiley face on but throwing the bill onto our table? Seriously??"}
{"text":"I have to say, something changed here, and for the better!  I went back here, and all of the meals served were phenomenal.  We ate: Fritata (5/5): Amazing Eggs benny (5/5): Delicious Eggs Rancheros (6/5): More please!"}
{"text":"Lola's Kitchen is my old faithful local brunch spot. I have been at least 10 times for brunch and also for lunch and dinner. They hit the spot every time. The food is great: generally organic and with plenty of vegetarian/vegan/gluten free options or suggested substitutions to the regular menu.   If you head there for weekend brunch after 11:30am you might have a short wait, but nothing in the capacity of Saving Grace or Lady Marmalade. The place is usually quite full but fortunately they have a decent sized space and efficient servers. I find the servers to be friendly, fun and just attentive enough.  Favourite things: - vegetarianized brunch burger - eggs rancheros - their home fries - so delicious - vegetarianized caesar ($5 during brunch times...and nice and spicy) - mimosa ($5 during brunch) - mushroom benny with goat cheese add on - espresso martini (although I don't see this on the online drinks menu anymore) - almond and chickpea burger or black bean burger (lunch/dinner menu)  It errs on the higher end for brunch but it is cheaper than other nearby options such as House-Maison and the Smith. And with much better food, in my opinion. One annoyance would be that they don't use their coffee machine during brunch because they are too busy. I will attest to the fact that it is extremely busy, and the bartender moves like road runner whipping out drinks. But still, sometimes one needs a latte."}
{"text":"Nice spot for a cozy brunch. Loved the cheesecake stuffed French toast; the home fries were not too bad. They offer some tasty vegan menu options as well. The service was great --very friendly staff."}
{"text":"A friend in Toronto recommended Lola's too me when I stayed over night in a nearby hotel, and I am so happy that he did. It was absolutely phenomenal, and my best restaurant experience of 2015 so far. We ate at the upstairs bar, but the server was so gracious, passionate and knowledgeable. Everything on the menu sounded wonderful, but I chose the stuffed squash blossom for my brunch. Blow me away! It was beautiful and unlike any dish I've experienced before Lola's. My friend had a Cobb salad which also looked great, but the squash was off the charts good.  I want to return for many more culinary delights here. But what a great first experience."}
{"text":"Showed up for brunch on a weekend right when it opened. Service was quick, friendly, frequent refills on my coffee. I had the special? Some sort of a wrap with pulled-pork and guacamole ... yummmmm! By the time we left, the place was PACKED with a hefty line up. nothing else much to note other than it was delicious and will be back again!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy having a casual meal (especially brunch) at Lola's. The staff are always very pleasant and accommodating, the food doesn't take too long and I've never experienced long wait times.  It's accommodating to food allergies with vegan, vegetarian and gluten free options.  The breakfast kale bowl is my fav thing on the menu for brunch, it's delicious and healthy and I really recommend it! Their crepes and other egg based dishes are good too, as are their burgers. I had a big shrimp salad for lunch once, it was good but not great.   service: 8.5/10 food: 7.5/10 pricing:8/10  ambience: 7/10"}
{"text":"I did some research on Yelp about brunch places near the Yorkville area and Lola's Kitchen came out on top in terms of positive reviews, decent prices, and menu selection. The walk was about 10-15 mins from Bay Station.   I came here at 11:30pm for Sunday brunch and to my surprise, I was seated right away at a table for 2. The place was pretty busy and the environment was definitely really loud! But it's a really charming sitting environment overall, as the restaurant is situated at a former home that was converted into a restaurant.   I got the Eggs Benedict with poached eggs and hash browns on the side (pictured).  It tasted great and the egg yolks were a little runny just the way I like it. However, it tasted kind of average...it was nothing special compared to your local brunch chains such as Kora's or Sunset Grill (there's one nearby!)   I was expecting more from such a highly rated brunch restaurant in terms of taste and/or presentation, which explains the 3 stars average rating."}
{"text":"I love this place.. to be specific, I love their burger. Highly recommended and something I rarely deviate from when I go there. Opportunity cost is too high."}
{"text":"For some reason I didn't expect much from this restaurant but turns out they are really good! They serve several kind of drink that my friends enjoyed very much. I ordered a vegetarian poutine and peppermint tea. Both are really good."}
{"text":"This place does not take reservations, as claimed by people on Yelp. It does seem that 2 person tables are available much more than three or four and as I looked around it seemed that most tables were for two people. My friend and I were seated immediately when we got there and people were waiting.  It's kind of loud inside - and from start to finish they were playing Drake. If don't know if they change up the music. Not too much space but not necessarily super cramped either as again, most of the tables there were for two. Service is very, very efficient and our server talked really fast but she was friendly.  Lola's specializes in vegan/gluten free options so you'll notice on the menu that there's not a lot of variety and it's mostly the same ingredients rehashed into different sorts of dishes. There are some dishes with meat. There aren't a lot of sweet dishes.  I ordered the eggs benny - pretty standard. You can choose your side - salad, home fries, or regular fries. We picked the home fries with \"Lola's house seasoning\" - and they're interesting. More sweet than salty and the flavor is unique. For me, not mindblowing though. Slightly undercooked.  The eggs benny was fairly average. The eggs come out very circular and they probably put them in molds. My eggs were a bit overdone unfortunately - the yolks barely ran when I put my fork in it and it was half cooked. Still tastes good though!   We got there at around 11:30 and by the middle of our meal no one was waiting (maybe it was too cold). Service is good - my friend just looked at the server and she knew we wanted our bill. We sat there for a good 15 minutes just talking without paying and no one really rushed us out as no one was waiting and there were empty tables.  All in all a decent experience. I think I would have liked a bit more variety but I suppose that is more difficult to do for a mostly vegan/gluten-free restaurant. Prices were average for brunch - I feel like I could get better brunch for a similar price. But if you choose Lola's it's not a bad choice either."}
{"text":"A great brunch spot if you can get a table.   I came with friends on Sunday and it was packed. You can make a reservation but you have to wait a while before you can sit down. The staff are really friendly and we enjoyed a great service.   The food plates are a decent portion. I ordered the Croque Lola which is similar to a Croque Monsieur sandwich and I was thinking of ordering a side of bacon. I ended not doing that and that was a good idea because by the end of the my plate I was FULL!  Their brunch menu is pretty extensive but it can accommodate any diet. While none specifically say \"vegan\", our server told us that they make any dish vegan. Just let them know. This was great as two of my friends are vegan.  Lola's a place I'd definitely return to!"}
{"text":"Food was really good. Its kind a heaven for Veggie lovers. Salad bow was never ending for me. Menu is option is good too. Location and ambiance is really noice. They have patio which is good too."}
{"text":"Food was decent but not a fan of paying $3 to add arugula on my egg benny and $1 for hot sauce. I was not told either of these were gonna cost extra until I got the bill."}
{"text":"At first, I thought this was a Filipino restaurant because \"Lola\" in Tagalog means \"Grandmother\" but it was a Canadian restaurant.  Went on Saturday night for my best friend's birthday party.  There was 11 of us.  The server's name was Jess and she did a good job handling a small party.  18% gratuity to the bill.  Ordered the Lola's burger which was good.  The meat itself was tiny bit dry but still had a some flavour and was indeed fresh.  Everything is made with ingredients from local farmers.  Nice art that is available for sale on the walls.  The thing that was ever truly amazing was THE POUTINE!!!!!!  At $9, I can honestly say, it was one of the best poutines I have ever had in my LIFE.  Some of the best I have had is in Montréal but there is something about this one that is a contender.  Maybe it is the skinny battered fries, the light gravy with a kick of spicy and the generous amount of cheese curds.  We split one 3 ways and it still was not enough.  We ordered a second and finished that off too.  It was better than their burger!  I am going to go back just for the poutine one of these days."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for brunch with the boyfriend.   For some bizarre reason we thought it was Saturday, so we showed up at around 2:30, and the restaurant is only open for brunch until 3 on Sundays. We were seated quickly and without issue but the first thing our server said to us is that we should hurry up with our order because the kitchen was about to close. I understand that everyone wants to go home, but this came across as a bit rude... Especially since a larger party walked in about 10 minutes after us. Aside from that our server was fairly attentive and we didn't have to wait too long for anything.   Anyways, we ordered our food, coffee and some mimosas. $5 freshly squeezed mimomas for weekend brunch! And they're a good size too. They were out of orange juice but I got mine with black cherry juice (amazing) while the boyf got his with raspberry-cranberry lemonade (also amazing). The coffee was pretty decent as well.  The food was tasty but I wish their menu was a bit more expansive. I got the Lola's breakfast, which was pretty good. The homefries are great, they're perfectly crispy and coated in some sort of delicious spice powder. The bacon was nothing to write home about but the eggs and toast (thick sliced multigrain doused in butter, yum yum) were delicious as well. My only complaint is that my eggs were served on a bed of sprouts, which negatively impacted my ability to sop up the yolks with my toast. Not really a big deal though. The boyf got the brunch bowl, which he was very satisfied with.   The restaurant has a great atmosphere. The tables are big, the chairs are comfortable, and they don't try to squeeze as much furniture as possible into the place; it's nice and roomy. The decor is simple and elegant; not too fancy, but not dive-y either.   Overall I enjoyed my experience here, and I'll definitely be back. I can't wait for summer so I can try out their amazing patio!"}
{"text":"8/10 for the great food and 1/10 for the service. The waitress dropped my friend's toast on the table and said, \"Oops haha\" and walked off... Not very hygienic. There was almost no service after the food is served."}
{"text":"1. food was good 2. service was meh  got there at about 1pm on a thursday and it wasn't busy anymore since everyone had finished their brunch meals already. I went with 2 of my friends and was greeted by a friendly hostess. Our waiter was okay, but a little impatient. it was as though we were rushed to order, and wasn't fond of our asking questions about the items on the menu.  i had the cauliflower fritters which had an indian twist on them, they were really good. it also comes with a yogurt/lime sauce witch is alright, a bit too yogurty for me.  I also had the Santa Fe salad which was amazing, i'd eat it again for sure! it was flavourful and had a generous serving. The tortillas that comes with it are really good too.   upon leaving, one of us had paid with the machine and expected to leave a money tip when we left. as we sat there finishing off our coffee after paying, the waiter comes to our table asking why we did not leave a tip, although he did not ask rudely it made things a bit awkward, we had explained that we would do so once we left and he said ok and walked away. We felt a bit unwelcome after that and proceeded to leave. on the way out, we were not even noticed.  good food."}
{"text":"Lola's Commissary, I need to revisit with the \"Brunch\" club to experience the service.   3 words - Cheesecake French Toast; which is pretty good.   But I've been getting take out from Lola, since I work a quick hop and a skip from there.   I have to say Lola's sandwiches & wraps are top-notch too, I've had her triple Decker with chicken, bacon, guac and oven-roasted tomatoes; as well as her BLT wrap, which was with bacon and oven-roasted tomatoes.   They're packed with flavour and come with either a soup, salad, roasted potatoes or fries.. get their \"roasted\" potatoes which are dressed with a Marsala spice and is a mix of sweet potatoes and regular potatoes.   Now i can't stand sweet potatoes, but the way Lola does them.. could possibly convert me."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now (weekend brunch a few times and weekday lunch a few times) and finally got around to writing a review.  While the food is decent and prices reasonable, the service is TERRIBLE.  They are always under staffed and every time I come here, the server apologizes for it.  I've often waited 5-10 minutes at the table with no greeting or a glass of water.  If you're into \"healthy\" places with a lot of gluten free, vegetarian dishes, you're not in a rush or care a lot about prompt service this place is for you.    I'm going to stop coming here as I think I've given it enough chances."}
{"text":"**DISCLAIMER** This is basically a long rant about the mediocre service we got from our particular waitress so I'll give the food review here first. I came with my mom on Mother's Day. Overall, the food was alright. I got the mushroom Benny and my mom got the Shakshouka which we had no idea what it was but it looked interesting so we tried it. It had a very Indian flavour which we weren't expecting since it's a Jewish dish. My egg was not as runny as I would have liked and the potatoes didn't have much flavour. The salad that came with the Shakshouka was just dressed with oil and a teeny bit of balsamic which my mom liked but I didn't. Nothing really stood out but it could have been overshadowed by the service we got.   Now for the rant. It was beautiful when we got there so we decided to sit out on the patio. My mom went to the washroom and left her chair out a bit but I hadn't noticed until another mother/daughter were trying to get to the table beside us and our waitress pushed the chair in really hard to make room for them. I figured she was probably just in a hurry so I ignored it. When she took our order she didn't look at us at all and turned sideways the whole time to put in our order but when she took the order of the mother/daughter next to us she was super nice and making eye contact like a normal waitress. She didn't check up on us even when she was asking the mother/daughter next to us how they were doing. Keep in mind that these tables are literally 2 feet away. We had to get another waitress to get a refill on the coffee. Then it started to get cloudy and we felt a few little drops of rain here and there but my mom and I were already half done so we figured the weather should hold out until then. As soon as the waitress saw the weather she came and asked the next table if they wanted to move inside but they declined. Then it actually started raining pretty quickly and she came to the next table again and said \"I'll grab this and that and get u guys a new coffee. Don't worry about that, come with me.\" Are we invisible?? My mom and I grabbed our remaining food and moved inside where we asked another waitress for a seat after standing there like idiots with our food and coffee for a couple mins. As my mom was finishing her salad, the waitress brought the bill without us asking and took away the spoon and cream for the coffee. My mom still wanted another refill (she likes her caffeine) so when she came back to ask if we needed a machine we asked her for the refill and everything else again. We were contemplating dessert but at that point I just wanted to pay and leave. The other waitresses/waiters seemed great and was friendly so I'm not sure if this particular waitress didn't like Asian people or something but we felt like we weren't being treated equally compared to the other Caucasian mother/daughter duo. Another Asian couple who were eating in the corner were also left to fend for themselves after they got their food. The name on the top of the receipt is Jenn and she had long red hair. There's plenty of brunch places around downtown so I don't think I'll be coming back to this one."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot. Get there early for a spot on the patio the wait is insane. The watermelon juice was unreal."}
{"text":"Had a egg benny. Would be better if they have latte or flat white rather than regular coffee."}
{"text":"Wandered into this place for brunch today. Great relaxed atmosphere. Comfy chairs.  Oddly my husband and I ordered pretty much the same thing, the Eggs Rancheros. Oh my this was scrumptious. He had his with the chorizo and home fries and declared himself really full afterwards. I had the salad with mine which was a quite generous mixed green and kale salad, lightly dressed.  The fresh juice was incredible. We both had the black cherry, blackberry, lime and ginger. I'm not a huge ginger fan either.  Service was friendly and helpful. Several clean washrooms available."}
{"text":"Wow.  New favorite brunch spot.  Had the brunch bowl, which was a substantial meal of sweet potatoes, sausage, cheese curds, mushrooms, onions, and two eggs on top.  Our trio also split the cheesecake-stuffed french toast, to give it a try.  The food was flavourful, plentiful, hot, and served quickly.  The service was polite and efficient, and our coffee was refilled.  If you are looking for something lighter, my friends enjoyed the granola bowl.  They mark their menu items as gluten-free when applicable, which is a nice touch.  The brunch menu is fairly big, with some creative items, so you won't run out of things to try after the first visit.  Prices are average, about $12-$14 for most meals (plus tax and tip).  I didn't try them but they have some reasonably priced brunch cocktails as well."}
{"text":"I don't know... I find Lola's Kitchen to be a bit over-hyped. Based on the sparkling reviews I would have expected food that will knock my socks off, but in reality it was just decent.   At 2 pm on a Saturday, there was no line-up, but the restaurant was totally bustling with people. We got seated pretty quickly, and the waitresses came by a good number of times to check up on us. You're surrounded by purchasable art, which is quite cool. Also- IT'S SO LOUD! I know brunch is a time to chat with family and friends, but oh my god, I could barely even hear myself think. I had to shout over the noise to actually talk to my friend who was right across from me.   We ordered bottomless coffee, and I have to say, I'm pretty good with caffeine but after my third cup I had an extreme caffeine hit that never wore off. (I'm actually buzzing just writing this.) It comes with cream and (presumably) cane sugar, so you can make your coffee however you like.   Our food arrived quickly- I ordered the brunch bowl, and my friend got the eggs benedict. The brunch bowl is REALLY soggy- there was an excess amount of liquid just travelling around in my bowl. The eggs benedict is very... sour? It's due to the lemon zest, but I must say I wasn't expecting it to taste like that.   Anyway, at around 3 pm there were less people, which is good because now I can speak at a normal volume. It's quite relaxing at that time, actually. The food is expensive (including tip), and my experience with Lola's Kitchen is pretty average. Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Came on Saturday for brunch, was told 3x by the waiter that we had a time limit as to how long we could stay even though there were many empty tables throughout our meal. There was very little wait time to get seated so I didn't understand why he kept enforcing the time limit and never smiled throughout our interactions.    The food was mediocre as we ordered a variety of things. The ambience was pleasant as there are two levels for seating and family-friendly (as most downtown brunch places are usually too compact to accommodate).   May come back to try the dinner menu, but my table was not impressed by the food or service that morning."}
{"text":"Lola's kitchen is probably one of my favourite spots for breakfast! I would recommend these amazing dishes to anyone who are a first time eater at Lola's kitchen. Great food, great service."}
{"text":"Love this place! Came here about 2 years ago, enjoyed myself and recently came back to try the dinner menu. It was a warm Saturday night and most places were busy, but they had room here. I suspect it is because the location isn't as central for Saturday night out fun. Service was great and our server checked on us throughout the night.   I had the ribs and frites which was fantastic! The ribs were fall of the bone and very flavourful. It also came with a ribs sauce which worked well. The fries were skinny fries, served with an aioli sauce. It was reasonably priced at around $20. Other folks at the table got the lamb burger (which I had when I first visited and very much enjoyed) and the chicken sandwich. Everyone enjoyed their meal.  Would visit again and recommend!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite local bar. It has a nice selection of cocktails and local beers, delicious food (especially the brunches), and a beautiful front patio open in the spring and summer."}
{"text":"Love the vegan/gluten free options. And the patio seats are just amazing. Only took us 20min on a Sunday morning to get a table"}
{"text":"Wonderful vegetarian food, so many choices it was difficult to decide what to order!  I had the BBQ Tofu and it was truly delicious. My wife had the Israeli Bowl and was equally happy. Our server, Tyson, was knowledgeable, courteous and friendly. We sat on the outdoor patio and enjoyed the people watching while having a glass of wine with our meal. Great atmosphere and great food. Highly recommended. We will be back."}
{"text":"To be very honest, I was disappointed when I left this place after brunch with my girlfriends on a Sunday. First of, this place does not take reservations (as per my tip) make sure you get here early and don't come in a large group (as per my other tip). It is much earlier to get tables for 2 for some reason. Even tables for 3-4 seem to be extremely hard to get. Anyways, back to my review....   Waiting for a table was not a big deal for me, however, see a lot of people that came after us get seated before us was just not very pleasant. What do I mean? Well, we were a group of 3 people and we were on the waiting list - in fact, that the top of the wait list. So when people after us, mostly table for 2s, were getting seated - I thought okay that makes sense. But when a table of 4 that came way after us got a table before we did that was when I got annoyed. It didn't make sense, so we asked the hostess - apparently they had forgotten about us. So then what was the point of having a wait list???   So what they did was they took a table for two and plopped an extra chair to make a table for three. I was like okay, at least we got a table now ... even though I am seating in the aisle. Definitely not a great start.... As we were waiting for quite some time to get seated (waiting approx 45 mins plus for the table, when the hostess told us 15 min at the beginning when we put our name on the wait list and we came just 20 minutes after their brunch service at the restaurant started), when the server for our table showed up we placed our order right away. I ordered the Mushroom Benny with salad and a coffee. The food came pretty quickly, but they got my order wrong - TWICE! Yes, they got my order wrong twice! First mistake, wrong dish completely. Second mistake, they gave me home fries instead of a salad. So the server brought me a side salad to rectify the second mistake.   To be honest, the food was average. Nothing special. In fact, I can get the same thing in Cabbage Town, which is normally where I frequent for weekend brunch.   Overall, I was not impressed."}
{"text":"It's almost laughable that this place takes top ratings in the church bloor/Wellesley area.   I've now given this place two attempts. The first was a bland unflavorful meal, nothing to rave about. The menu has very little variation and little creativity.   The last attempt was ridiculously long wait times with a half full restaurant. Long enough that it tempted walking out before even ordering.   Keep going south down church there are alot of other gems you won't find listed on yelp."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot with a nice patio out front and lots of seating (I don't like the thought of waiting in line/waking up at the crack of dawn to get a table at places like Bonjour Brioche or Aunties & Uncles). I made a reservation, but you probably don't need one if you show up before noon. The vibe is laid-back and eclectic. You can come here with anyone - on a weekend you'll see an even mix of groups of friends, couples, families, and people alone. Servers are friendly and easygoing. They have specials every day so be sure to check the board! Otherwise, the brunch menu is pretty standard with your typical omelettes, eggs benny, and sweet options like stuffed french toast. I went with an egg white frittata which was loaded with veggies and really yummy! While you are waiting for your meal, they bring out mini rice krispy squares that are gooey and freshly made -- a nice touch!"}
{"text":"Awesome brunch place on Church, near Yonge & Bloor. They make great eggs benny and have quite a bit of vegetarian and vegan options. I'll definitely be coming here again but small warning, it gets quite busy and loud."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place and was let down. The food is average. We ordered mushroom Benny with a side of bacon & the regular Benny with home fries. The home fries look burnt but thankfully didn't taste like that (bland but not burnt). The service was super slow. We arrived once it opened. We were probably the first people there and left after tables who came later on. The server took a long time to return to our table to get our orders and give the bill. We had a hard time flagging her down too because she was no where in sight.   The best part of our meal was the eggs Benny. When you cut through, a wave of orange yolk came oozing out. We loved it.   Overall, we wouldn't come back here though."}
{"text":"Lola's is a casual, healthy-option spot that I have been to a number of times. As a vegetarian, I love how many options I have, even for dinner, which tends to be something like pasta or a veggie burger at other restaurants. Though, if you aren't vegetarian, there will be plenty of options for you, as well. I usually get a grain bowl of sorts, and it has always been filled with fresh, delicious ingredients. I appreciate that they don't skimp on tofu! Service has also always been great, in my opinion. Once their heaters weren't working (during winter) and we (and other tables) received 15% off simply because we were a bit cold. That definitely made me want to return! I've never been for weekend brunch, so I can't comment on that as others have, but I have had great experiences for lunch and dinner. Good pricing as well."}
{"text":"I had to get the cheesecake stuffed French toast at Lola's. I also got the stuffed grilled cheese with chorizo sausage and caramelized onions.  The stuffed grilled cheese was tasty even though I wish there was more chorizo in it. It came with Lola's potatoes which is a mixed of potatoes and sweet potatoes. It was alright but a bit dry.  The cheesecake stuffed French toast was the real reason why I came here. There's a slice of cheesecake between two slices of French toast and on top was a generous amount of blueberry. After trying the stuffed French toast, I have to say I prefer eating the two items separately. It was a bit dry and I couldn't really solve the issue by soaking it in syrup since the cheesecake is so sweet already. It's worth trying once but I wouldn't order it again.  It's funny how I cam here for the stuffed French toast but I would actually come back here for the stuffed grilled cheese."}
{"text":"Came here on a thursday night as a party of three at 6pm. The place has a great bustling atmosphere and almost completely filled up with patrons by 6pm! We ordered the curried chickpea burger, black bean burger and lamb burger, all with fries on the side.   The person who gave us our orders accidentally gave me the curried chickpea burger and my friend the black bean burger. Maybe it's because I'm not used to vegetarian burgers so I couldn't even tell the difference! Our waitress came by to check up on us and told us we are eating each other's order when she could have totally just not admit to what happened. Thank you for letting us know!   None of us could finish our food. We were so full by the end of the meal! How satisfying! My first vegetarian burger experience was awesome, thanks Lola's kitchen!"}
{"text":"Stylish and quaint place to go for downtown brunch or dinner. Daily food and drink specials are offered in additional to the regular menu. They feature a variety of gluten-free and vegetarian options, but also has some seriously tasty choices for the rest of us meat-eaters.   I ordered the ribs and frites meal ($19.50) which absolutely blew my mind! These ribs were literally fall off the bone and extraordinarily flavorful. The accompanying jus and horseradish aioli dips perfectly complemented the meat. The side of duck fat fries was also very good. This dish was well worth the price for its quality and taste.  My coworkers got their respective dishes (chicken & quinoa, and a burger) and they also seemed to be very satisfied. The atmosphere was nice and the service was good. My impression of this place is they offer healthier choices and maintain a high quality in their food. I would definitely recommend this place, and more specifically, the ribs!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious everything was fresh and the atmosphere was trendy but comfy.   Our waitress was very attentive to our food allergies and had a thorough understanding of the menu."}
{"text":"GREAT HEALTHY Tasty FOOD, AMAZING BRUNCH ON WEEKENDS, and had to go back few times for lunch as those pizzas are AMAZING and healthy , and very original!!  A great new restaurant with very talented chef! Deserves more than one visit!"}
{"text":"Even thought work right across from Lola's and I live in the area, I've only been here once.  Last week, our office was dead - thanks to the holidays a few of the guys in the office decided to take a long lunch over at Lola's.  I'm glad I tagged along.  As Su mentioned, the restaurant is on the first floor of an old house with the bathrooms and a few larger rooms upstairs.  I will admit that the washrooms were FREEZING, but it is an old house and you're not in there that long.  I'm sure it's fine in the summer, and most days.  The decor is very boho arts and crafts, and all of the items on the walls are for sale.  The paint is a fresh colour and the smell of the food is every welcoming.  With all of these little touches it makes the place very warm and inviting.  We were seated very quickly and the staff were super friendly.  We went to lunch at 12:30 and this place was pretty packed...that said something good to me right away.  I'm used to massive portions and lack of taste, but this place has the right amount of flavour and portion size.  I ordered the Ancho Chicken wrap and was pleasantly surprised.  Their fries are great - order them.  I will admit that their condiments are lacking - you get about a tablespoon of ketchup for a whole table....  The table water that they serve is infused with lemon and is a very nice touch to just plain table water and is less tacky then having a large lemon wedge slammed on the side of the glass.  My wrap and side was under $15 with tip and tax.  For a meal that leaves you full and that is full of flavour - hit up Lola's"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness nice place with great warm welcoming atmosphere very friendly staff smiley and pleasing. Wow the short rib dinner with roasted beet and goat cheese salad. First the ribs are absolutely tasty and comforting especially with their beef jus and cream sauce salad is perfect what a nice place with great food and awesome workers"}
{"text":"LOVED the mimosa, only wished that they could give a bit more!  Ordered the vegetarian mushroom benny. Hard to please me with bennies but these were great. The eggs were cooked where it wasnt too runny nor was it solid. The hollandaise was what threw me off. Wasnt too sure why but it didnt taste like the usual hollandaise sauce. It was still tasty but I prefer the old fashion creamy, thick ones.  Mushroom and spinach was a good combo with the eggs. The granola bowl was also very yummy.   Its a lot of food that they give you!"}
{"text":"This is the hipster restaurant of the hipster neighborhood of Toronto, I mean, the food is ordinary, and that just doesn't justify the high prices. Restaurant is super loud, and just nothing stands out, like at all, from a much cheaper breakfast place."}
{"text":"Lola's black bean burger is one of the very best veggie burgers I've ever had.  There is just no comparison to the taste. It is crispy and savory, and lavished with guacomole. The only downside is that it costs $15, which is a lot for any veggie burger, even the best. The fries were thinly cut an a-ok, and service was very good. There is a small wine list, as well."}
{"text":"I usually get the rice bowls here.  I liked this place initially but then I began getting sick the last 3 times there. I'm not sure if it's what I'm eating but it seems really consistent when I'm there. The food tastes and feels fresh but I feel it isn't for me.Staff is friendly and responsive. It's a goo place to eat. Just not for me."}
{"text":"The family and I went there for Brunch on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. Even though we arrived shortly after 12pm we still got a table right away (inside, as the patio seats, \"with side order of bees\" was totally full).  Weekend crowd is noticeably different from weekday crowd. I work in the area, so I know that the lunch time crowd typically includes a good mix of office workers. On the weekend it's all locals, young couples, hipsters from the many many new condos in the area.  The back room is incredibly loud -- the brick wall causes the sound to bounce around, and as the room fills up, the sound level elevates exponentially. Not the best for a quiet romantic meal if that's what you are looking for.  Food was good, but not great. Poached eggs were a tiny bit overdone, and short ribs/au jus in the brunch bowl overwhelms and literally drowns everything else in the bowl.   I ordered the Huevo Rancheros with Chorizo. The sausage was deliciously spicy and added a lot to the dish. Without that $3 option, I might have given them only 2 stars. Good amount of fresh guac but I didn't notice the roasted corn (might have been there but there wasn't much and it got buried). I didn't notice that it came on a hard taco shell, I think I might have preferred it on bread/toast but I guess that would have made it less Tex-Mex.  Classic breakfast looked OK. Bacon was nicely crisped. Lots of home fries. But they only give you two eggs whereas for $11 I would have expected three as you'd get at most of the chain BF places.   Coffee was good and strong, and refills kept coming, so I can't complain about that.  Interesting that people say they are known for the weekend brunch menu, I found that the weekday lunch menu is far superior."}
{"text":"When I first read the reviews on Lola's Kitchen, I was like YES I HAVE TO GO. Little did I know that reviews lie, and this is not the most epic breakfast place I have ever been to. In fact, I kind of thought it was a waste of money.  Here's why:  1. The restaurant is loud and the tables are so close together, it feels extremely crowded. 2. The waiter spilled coffee and milk all over, and it took so long to get a coffee refill. 3. Can someone explain to me why a restaurant would serve grilled cheese on cold bread?  4. The sausages were so burnt and there was so much spice in it, I don't know who the chef was, but he/she definitely has no taste buds.   It's only redeeming quality: potatoes were good."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal for lunch. The food is excellent and prepared with care. I had a chimichanga lunch special. I will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Yet another great recommendation from my fellow Yelpers.   I was saying at the Marriott Yorkville and in need of a little sustenance for a slightly late Friday lunch. This gem was about a five minute walk. It is WELL worth that walk.   Everything on the somewhat limited menu was delicious looking. One person at my table ordered a half salad. Outstanding looking. She loved it. And it was the size of a regular, entree salad at most restaurants.   The French fries were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside -- perfect.   My chicken breast sandwich with side salad was perfect. What sold me on it were the sweet potatoes, which I love. What a superb pairing with the tasty chicken breast.   Nice, craft beer selection. Not many choices, but all good.   Would I come back? Heck yes!!"}
{"text":"Lola's is my go-to place to bring people from out of town. They have great vegetarian options that are super flavourful, and their French fries have some special seasoning that is absolutely delicious! Their black bean burger is probably the best veggie burger I've ever had and I can't resist ordering it every time I'm here. There's a nice variety of cocktails to choose from and the servers are always helpful with recommendations. The inside can get a little loud, but the patio in the summer is a great place to catch up with friends over cocktails. Everything is decently priced and totally worth it."}
{"text":"Live nearby and I love the food. Was here with two friends today and decided to pay on one credit card, I left my portion of the tip, and friends had change and bills to leave their own tip. I gave $6 and I guess the waiter thought that was the entire tip on the bill. Threw the receipt down the table, walked away immediately shaking his head without saying a word.. we were appalled.  Ruined the entire experience and my friends decided to not leave their tips. Even if that was the tip we were giving, the waiter could ask us why, but just blatantly walking away? But yes, great food!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my experience here. I have had this place on my to do list for a long time and I went one Sunday just before 1pm. We were lucky and waited for about 15 mins without a reservation. We watched as the food runners carry food from the dining area out to the waiting area and up a long flight of stairs (not appealing).   I ordered the Benny and my friend the breakfast burger. The food took a bit of time which is fine because its brunch and we get it, food doesn't come flying out of the kitchen. But the food came out cold. Her burger bun was cold, didn't seem toasted at all. She just had the burger patty, it was just ok. My Benny not only didn't come with medium eggs as I had asked but the entire thing was cold, yes even the hollandaise!! The waiter didn't return to the table to check on our food. When i finally waived down the server and told him my food is cold, he asked if I would like it redone and I said yes please. He left me my plate since I could eat the side salad as I wait for my meal to be redone. Few minutes later 2 plain (still runny) poached eggs are brought to me. Are you kidding me? You would think they would redo my order since the hollandaise, the eggs, and English muffin it comes on were ALL cold! I was so disappointed with that the server that he would just redo the eggs. Or is this the restaurant's policy?  My friend told me that my meal might have been cold because the same order went to the table behind us first and was sent back to the kitchen because it was a mistake.   We also shared a small stuffed French toast ($7) and it was dry and unimpressive. I wouldn't recommend it.  Sure the ambiance is nice here but I will not be returning for the overpriced and overrated food."}
{"text":"They won't make americanos/espressos etc on the weekend as 'it takes too long' and as the server condescendingly explained 'if you wanted to have a second one we'd have to charge you for that'. Uh ya, that's how it works. I know how to order and pay for an americano (and even a second one if I so choose).   My brunch date opted to try their drip coffee and it was not good and he was disappointed.  I just can't enjoy my brunch without good coffee. Can't!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: A great casual and trendy place with interesting wall paintings, average noise  Service: Good service, nothing stood out, but nothing bad to complain about  Food: We came here for their weekend brunch, ordered the Eggs Rancheros and Breakfast Kale Bowl. - Eggs Rancheros was OK, portion was very small with 1 tortilla, and didn't think the scrambled eggs went well with the dish, but everything else was fine.  Note: you can only choose one item as your side dish, can't do half and half :(  - Breakfast Kale Bowl was pretty good (except one of my eggs was broken with half runny yolk and some water when served), loved the chorizo, and would preferred more if there was less of the paprika oil drizzle because it got a bit heavy and greasy near the end.  Overall: would come here again in the future to try something else, still a great little brunch spot. ALSOOO, they have a phone charging station near the entrance!"}
{"text":"I actually love this place. One of my favourite veggie burgers in the city (kind of like a falafel inspired party) on a puffy onion bun. Add feta to the burger, which I think is necessary otherwise the burger can be a little dry. The Santa Fe bowl with braised beef and the fried broccoli and cauliflower are also delicious, and we love their kale Caesar salad. Great brunch too! Just ordered on Foodora and their takeout was also just as good!"}
{"text":"Order the California Bowl! It's the most yummy healthy meal you'd have in your life. It's a bit pricey but it's super filling so you can get half of it to go. Service is great, patio is nice. I love this place."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Tons of gluten free options- as in actually gluten free, with a dedicated fryer and cooking surface. I'm Celiac and this place is spot on. They even have gluten free pouring! And a veggie option for that as well. Tons of veggie options and most everything is locally sourced which is awesome. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Spent the night in Toronto, so I always consult my book marks for brunch! We don't spend a whole lot of time in toronto, so I have a lot! Lola's was walking distance from our hotel so we decided on it for brunch. The restaurant is pretty adorable. It has patio seating, an upstairs and a downstairs. It was quite busy when we arrived around 11 and we were seated upstairs. They have a bartender manning the floor up there so he acts as the waiter and the bartender. He also submits the orders and our food came up incredibly quick!  The menu is pretty small and if you're like my husband and like enormous breakfast meals, this isn't the place for you. The serving sizes are not big. We both ordered the standard Lola's breakfast - 2 eggs, 3 slices of bacon, home fries and toast. The home fries were incredible and they were able to provide gluten free toast (they also had gfree crepes and most every meal could be adapted). The food was good and we enjoyed the atmosphere. Our waiter/bartender was excellent as well!  It's a little on the expensive side I guess but I think we spent about $40 which is actually decent for brunch. I'm not sure my husband would return (remember, he likes big brunch) but I wouldn't mind returning in the future."}
{"text":"It was a very nice restaurant and it served very delicious food. Although we waited for 1 hours to sit, I can say the wait was worth it. The price was a little bit high, and the vegan dish(tofu scramble) was amazing. I will go back, but only in the special occasion."}
{"text":"Before heading over to the Panasonic to see a show, my folks picked out Lola's Kitchen for dinner due to its proximity to the theatre. Lola's kitchen seems to be the type of place that offers gluten free fare and a lot of healthy, organic food. Never a bad thing.  When I arrived I was the second last of our party to get to the restaurant. My folks and my friend were seated towards the wall and although I had a coat and two bags (coming from work) it was difficult to get to my seat. they had backed the tables and chairs up to each other to the point where I couldn't get into my seat without sliding into it or interrupting the person sitting behind me at another table and asking them to move. Once the table behind us left, they moved the tables apart a bit but it still felt very cramped.  We started with the poutine to share, which was quite good and I would get again. Very tasty and slightly decadent. I ordered the tacos for dinner, two shrimp and two pork tacos, upon the server's recommendation of at least three tacos for dinner. The tacos are pretty small here, I wished I'd ordered an additional side to help tide me over for the rest of the night. The shrimp tacos were great, awesome flavor, love shrimp in the soft tortilla. The pork ones were okay but I make better pulled pork at home.  My main issue with these tacos was that the chef clearly has no idea how to build a soft taco. They put all of the sauces, tomatoes and other wet ingredients at the bottom and the meat on top of said ingredients. So after one or two bites, the entire soft taco fell apart as the bottom ripped open. It isn't rocket science to make a good taco so it was pretty disappointing that everything on my plate ended up falling apart.  Everyone else at the table raved about their dinners but I really wasn't super impressed. I've had better food and better experiences at other places and the menu here didn't really strike my fancy so I won't be back."}
{"text":"We tried Lola's on a recent vacation in Toronto because it was listed as vegan-friendly, and we weren't disappointed. In fact, we ate there two out of three nights.  The vegan dinner offerings were all delicious (we shared), and vegan or not, you have to try the vegan carrot cake. Amazing. Lola's has a nice menu for omnivores and vegans alike, that emphasizes fresh, quality, organic food.  The staff was friendly and service was great. I wish we lived in Toronto so we could go back."}
{"text":"Lola's used to be my favorite brunch spot. On my last 3 visits my friends and I had the same waiter who ALWAYS messes up. He is a nice guy, don't get me wrong, and even kinda cute, but 3 times! Seriously?! 1st time: I ordered the 'Shroom Benny (my fave!) and I always ask for no onions and a side of goat cheese. Wanna guess what I got? Onions and no goat cheese and the English muffin was cold--they forgot to toast it (I know this part was not the waiters fault). 2nd time: He messed up my friend's order and brought her some random dish and then I had to go on a hunt for him to let him know what had happened. 3rd time: He forgot about us. He walked around us and gave coffee to ALL the people around us.  He just kept walking past us. After 20 minutes I had to physically get up and fetch him so my friend and I could order. These concerns are minor, but when they happen on a consistent basis, it really impacts your dining experience.   When the service is good, I can't fault Lola's 'cause they really do serve a good brunch."}
{"text":"Went back to Lola's a few more times recently. Amazing Food! I'm a fan again. LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"We ate at Lola's last night for dinner. It was certainly ok, but we found that it was nothing special or worth getting excited about. I had the Portobello mushroom sandwich, my wife had the nachos, and my son had a burger. The initial appeal was around the gluten free options, and there were plenty to pick from, but overall food quality didn't seem to match up with the price. Additionally the service was not great at all. They were slow, and inattentive, as we are not accustomed to having to ask repeatedly for drink refills, especially at a place that is going to charge almost $20 for a burger and fries."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place and always leave feeling great! Fresh, healthy ingredients and beautifully served food. Ambience is relaxed and staff are friendly. I've been twice for brunch and once for dinner and will definitely make this a regular spot in the future."}
{"text":"One of my favourite brunch places in Toronto. Good food, good service. I like get together with my friends for brunch meetings. My friends can be sometimes picky, but they all loved this place and we have been going back to Lola's Kitchen over and over again :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food, friendly service, and tasty food!  The polenta fries were to die for. The drinks were strong and worth the price! I went for a late lunch and we were served quickly. They have something for everyone. This is the place in Toronto to take a diverse group of people for a reasonable price - vegetarians, vegans, and meat eaters will not be disappointed. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food here is good with lots of wonderful gluten-free options. I have decided not to go back, however, since the service has been consistently poor and reached the level of rude today. At no point should anyone ever be told curtly that they should wait on the sidewalk until their table - not yet set up for a group although unoccupied - is ready. Certainly not during a time when the restaurant is mostly empty, where traffic is not yet an issue.   Too bad. But given that service is half the experience, good food doesn't make up for atrocious customer service."}
{"text":"After the very unsatisfied meal the night before (https://www.yelp.ca/biz/kiyomizu-restaurant-north-york?hrid=I2JbEbNV9EuL5Yk6vVgI7A&utm_source=ishare), I felt quite empty and really wanted something very good to make my day. I came across this vegetarian /vegan brunch place on Yelp and I decided to give it a try.   We arrived around 11:50 and there was a lineup at the door. The staff put my name of the wait list; there were around 5 groups before me. She advised me the wait will be around 25 minutes for table for 4. Actually the wait was shorter than that; the turnover of the place was quick.   We order the fresh juice with Greens, lemon and Ginger to start with. I highly recommend to try their juice, very fresh and well balanced flavours. Also order the large size instead of small. Small is not half size of big but 1/3 of the large.   For the main, these are the feedback:  Brunch Bowl - the pulled short ribs had very rich flavour yet not salty or overpower; the beef jus were absorbed in the bed of baby new potato. The organic sunny eggs were nice.   Breakfast kale bowl - pretty filling with chorizo, squash, quinoa and kales. Ingredients were very fresh.   Gluten Free Warm Granola - love the coconut cream, anything with coconut would work for me! The pear and cranberry compote were not overly sweet and soft yet not smashy.   Brunch Burger - the Ontario grass fed beef really tasted better and had a nice grilled aroma. It was opted for no sunny eggs on top due to dietary restrictions. The Lola home fries were my child's favourite.   Our experience at Lola's Kitchen was great, friendly staff and prompt service, great food with ingredients from local and organic. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I cam with friends for Sunday brunch and enjoyed the 'eggs freddy' which included spinach-hollandaise sauce, smoked bacon with a side of soup, salad or fries. For $1 extra you can have a mix of half fries-half salad. My drink of choice was the pomegranate-green tea iced tea. The flavors were not as robust as I would have liked. I have had better eggs benedict. But the ambiance was perfect."}
{"text":"I could eat lunch here everyday! Amazing spot, would be great for a date :) I ordered the black bean burger, which had guacamole, red onion, tortilla chips and tomato on it with a side garden salad. So delicious!!! I can't wait to come back here! The brunch looks delicious too :)  Update: try their California bowl! Absolutely amazing, and super healthy!"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch and I was pleasantly surprised. 11am brunch was not packed at all, possibly the snow storm the previous day affected the patron traffic. It's a large restaurant with an upstairs and downstairs. In the room we were seated, there were 9 2 person tables. This was only in 1 of the 2 rooms downtairs.  I ordered the eggs benny and my girl friend the eggs rancheros, which came in a taco shell. We both ordered the frites. The eggs were delicious! I loved poached eggs! The sauce was just the right amount for me - the muffins were not soggy. There was a strong salty taste in my eggs benedict and I don't know what the source was: the sauce? the peameal bacon? Despite this strong salty taste, I really enjoyed the eggs benedict dish. However, the English muffin soon became stiff! I don't know if the muffins were not fresh?  The frites were delicious though! My friend had no complaints with her breakfast dish either.  Free coffee refills."}
{"text":"It was good, but not amazing. I do love how everything is gluten free and organic though!  My boyfriend and I came here and ordered the brunch bowl and the mushroom benny. I like how the brunch bowl was unique and tasted good - but it did not blow me away (compared to the reviews I read). My boyfriend got the mushroom benny and felt that it was good, but could have been better as well.  I would have to think about whether or not I love it enough to come back."}
{"text":"A decent sit down lunch option in the area but make a reservation as they tend to get swamped during this time.  I ordered the petite kale Caesar salad ($8) with a side of chicken ($4).  Salad was yummy as was the chicken but served on a ridiculously small side plate.  Every time I tried to stab a bite, piece of kale would fall off the side.  Service was friendly...no complaints here."}
{"text":"I had my first-ever brunch experience here over the weekend, and it was *glorious*. After a lunch experience in the summer that had me enjoying a delicious and healthy salad and cold-pressed juice, we decided to go back for brunch after our first restaurant fell through. We are so glad the other place didn't work out, because now we are making Lola's our new spot!   Vegan crepes. Need I say more? They were also gluten-free and stuffed with fresh fruit and covered in compote, syrup, and coconut cream. SO GOOD! My partner had huevos rancheros with some sort of meat product and a whopping serving of home fries, and he absolutely loved it. Our server was also amazing - super friendly, laid-back but professional, and fun to talk to and quick to provide service!   We will be back. Happily."}
{"text":"Lola's is one of our \"go to\" breakfast haunts. The menu is sufficient, the service is attentive and the atmosphere is young and progressive. I always have the bennies but there is a variety including vegan."}
{"text":"For all those who are trying to do a 2018 new years resolution to be fit... Lola kitchen will get you there without sacrificing your taste buds.  Even if you're a carnivore, this place does offer your chunks of meat to chew on while enjoying a few good sprigs of greens to go with it.  Just off the boujee Yorkville area, you'll find Lola's in a quieter section in a old converted house.  It actually feels like someone's home as they retained much of the original character.  Though it is middle of a terrible winter, I can see they have a nice front patio for the days in the sun.  Unlike most brunch spots, Lola's does not cram in the tables.  There is enough space where you're not overhearing your neighbours.  It also helps they have a 2nd story for more tables as well.  Overall, I'll say it's a hip, warm, and inviting spot.  As for the wait... just call ahead.  Really.  In a span of 30 minutes driving to the place, it went from a 'walk in' situation to a '50 min wait'.  yeaaaah.  So call and be ready to wait on a Sunday... especially if you're coming in between 11 am and 1 pm.  If you have to wait, the cute Piedmont Cafe is a nice place to chill and its only 2 minutes away walking.  Service here is great... thoughtful and friendly. Though there was only one main person watching the entire upstairs, he was always great and available to answer a question.  We never really had an empty cup of coffee sitting about.  The hold up is probably the kitchen... though it did take some time to get our plates.  I noticed near the end that the later tables got their meals really quickly.  One thing they did really well was rectify a small little 'oops'.  We also ordered a side of hot sauce and its was a small charge of $1.  No issue with the price and my dish really needed the pick me up.  Well, 5...10...15 minutes pass and I'm nearing the end of eating my meal.  The staff realizes we never got it and ended up giving it to us for free.  Small little thing but his awareness made it a good note.  Breakfast bowls (chorizo and one veg) - Ok... this was just right for my veggie loving butt.  I like a good brunch with nice oozy eggs and lots of vegetables.  This was just perfect as it kicked off both parts easily.  I would say that I liked the chorizo bowl better because the spices were bold and made it taste much better.  Even the addition of the additional pepper still didnt make the vegetables jump off the plate to make me LOVE the veggie one.  Still ... a solid dish but the inner carnivore loved the chorizo more.  4/5  If you're ready to jump here early in the morning or much later in the day, it's a nice spot for a good brunch ... especially if you're willing to embrace the greener side!"}
{"text":"A go-to spot for brunch! I've been here quite a few times and if time isn't an issue, arriving at 12pm makes it really easy to get a table. Feels like a family's dining room inside. The staff are friendly and service is really fast. My favourite is the Breakfast Kale Bowl ($14), which sounds pretty basic but is actually delicious and filling. There's a nice, balanced ratio of ingredients: chorizo, fennel, kale, squash, quinoa and TWO poached eggs. The menu also has diverse options if dining with any vegetarian, vegan or gluten-free friends. Overall - good value and tasty dishes for people who want more than eggs and bacon for brunch."}
{"text":"I chose this place for my belated birthday brunch, and I am -SO- happy I did. My parents are pretty hard to please, so even though this meal was for me, having my parents enjoy the meal was a bonus!  Let me just say this place is an art gallery inside.Various paintings are scattered on the lightly coloured beige walls. My favorite was the Bob Marley one. Oh yeah, their washrooms are spotless and nicely designed. It was also freezing...anyway..  The service was good, I mean it was a bit slow, but on a Sunday brunch, we were seated immediately. Lucky us. However, the food took a bit longer, but man, it was worth the wait.  (If you don't wanna wait long, I suggest you go at 1:30-2.)  We all ordered Eggs benedict. I personally had the 'Shroom Benny (11) which was by far one of the BEST eggs benedict dishes I've tried. These guys aren't cheap with their ingredients 'cause there was a GENEROUS portion of mushrooms. Also, the eggs were perfect and the hollandaise sauce was nice and creamy. The downside was that my salad was really bitter. Do not order a salad. Order the sexy potatoes which comes with sweet potato and yukon gold. It's delish.  I sampled the other two orders: Eggs Lola 11 (ancho chicken on tortilla) and Eggsmopolitan 14 (smoked salmon). I found the smoked salmon to be a bit too salty, but as for the Eggs Lola, it was A+. This was a really flavourful dish from the creamy avocodo to the well spiced and seasoned chicken.  My parents tried my 'Shroom benny and said in translation \"It's good...wow.. they make it better than some hotels.\" SCOREEE.   Weekly Specials: Monday - 'Shroom Benny 8 Tuesday - Cheesecake french toast 9 Wednesday - Hump day Pizza 9 Thursday - Any wrap with frites 9 Friday - Love me some pasta! 9  Overall: I think I'm gonna go back Tuesday to try the Cheesecake French Toast. CAN'T WAIT!"}
{"text":"I finally got in here for brunch on a saturday.  It was awesome.  Food was good but I'd have to say it falls into the 'fancy brunch' category (i.e. an orange juice is 6$).    It had great ambiance, cool servers, and everyone was young and fun in there.  I'd totally go back.  Maybe for drinks next time.  I bet it is great for day time pints.  Only tip would be to go with no more than 4 people and to go early.  I've tried to go there about 3 times before my most recent visit and the line was always too long.   They will take your cell number and text you when the table is ready though.  It was also a little on the loud-side though.  (Echoey - if that is a word).  But all in all I was pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Service was alright. Other tables got more attention than we did but we're not high-needs anyway. It can get really loud with obnoxious patrons. We tried to make a reservation but were told they could only reserve tables after 12:30 because of the rush. Showed up anyway at 12 and were seated right away with no wait. So don't be discouraged if they say they're full over the phone.  The food here is standard brunch fare, with the exception of the cheesecake stuff french toast. We had the:  Mushroom Eggs Benedict - Creamy yet tasteless hollandaise, too sweet onions, perfect mushrooms and small yolked eggs. I've had better eggs benedict so this rates low.  Huevos Rancheros - Wasn't bad but would not get again so says my boyfriend. I tasted a bit and it was watery from the beans.  Lola's Potatoes - good, nothing too special  Frites - yum, perfectly crispy shoestring fries. Definitely get the garlic aoili to dip.  Cheesecake stuffed french toast (mini) - split in half is the perfect way to round out brunch. It was actually not that sweet.  With coffee our total bill came around $40, so not really worth it but not a great loss to try out a new brunch spot either."}
{"text":"Just tried this place and I have mixed feelings. The atmosphere was casual, friendly staff great for hanging out on Sunday mornings. Quality if food not so great. Had the mushroom Benedict and eggs were not reliable, came out all boiled through and through. They were happy to replace it and I asked  for runny eggs but came out almost cooked through again. We also had frittata and it was a fried omelette, just very fried. Home fries were good. THEY DONT HAVE FRENCH TOASTS ANYMORE, not for a year now so I was disappointed. Their coconut creme cupcake was good. Caesars and coffee also good. Will try again but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've been here for both brunch and dinner several times and you cannot go wrong!!! Everything I've tried is so delicious and healthy without \"tasting healthy\";)! They always have great vegetarian and vegan options and the waitresses are simply lovely and go out of their way to make sure you feel special even on their busiest nights !! She offered to get us drinks and menus inside while we waited for a seat on the patio since the weather was so beautiful that night. Thanks Jen!"}
{"text":"Like the atmosphere (modern, artsy). We have come here several times and it was always delicious. Maybe a bit on the pricy side for some but I'd say it's worth it."}
{"text":"A healthy place for breakfast unlike the greasy place options. I got the egg roachero was good extra charge of $3 of chorizo I thought wasn't needed at the chorizo is minced and not a huge deal. Was pretty good and my be had the burger he said it was okay, wasn't too impressed. I wish they had more options more sandwiches maybe ....not sure if I'd come back"}
{"text":"I was fairly underwhelmed with this place. We came early at 10am so got a seat right away which was nice since they don't do reservations. I ordered the shakshouka and it had an odd flavouring to it. I've had shakshoukas before that have more of a tomato sauce versus just cherry tomatoes. I can't even describe the flavour of this but I was constantly torn between thinking 'this is ok' and 'I actually don't really like this'. Despite the odd taste it was also fairly bland. Like something you'd expect at Sunset Grill. And the home fries that came with it were extremely bland, I don't even think they were salted. The final verdict was I burnt my tongue and I didn't even like it. The server wasn't very friendly either. Overall I wouldn't come back here, there are much better brunch places in the city."}
{"text":"Incredible place with awesome music, service, drinks and FOOD. I wasn't expecting much from simple scrambled eggs, but they were delicious. It's a perfect place to start your day with."}
{"text":"It's better to reserve the table before you arrive. The staff is very friendly. It's a greatest place for brunch on weekend. I ordered egg Benedict and brunch bowl. Both are nice. Brunch bowl tastes very special. LOVE the place and food."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place.  Note: no kids menu or other arrangements, but the stuff is very accommodating for families."}
{"text":"Service was amazing! Food not so much. Tasteless dry bean burger left much to be desired. Potatoes for vegetarian poutine were subpar. Gravy was probably the best part! For the price of the bill, I won't return."}
{"text":"This place is extremely loud. I came here around 1:30 pm and even though there was a line up, it moved pretty fast. There are beautiful art work all over the walls and what I liked about this place is that it's a house turned into a restaurant. I made a mistake by ordering crepes though. I have a sweeth tooth and wanted to get pancakes but they didn't have any.  What kind of Brunch place doesn't have pancakes? I ordered the cerepe and it tasted very strange. Some people may like it, but I didn't. I can't pinpoint what was wrong with it. They had it served with coconut cream, which I didn't find appetizing. My boyfriend's meal was very good though. He got a healthy Eggs Rancheros, which I tried and liked better than my crepe. Overall, the menu is very limited, but it was worth a shot."}
{"text":"I went out for dinner with my Boyfriend and his family to Lola's kitchen. I had read some other reviews raving about how good the brunch was but unfortunately, I felt like their dinner menu fell short. I order the streak frites and requested the steak to be medium rare. My fiancé had the pulled chicken sandwich and frites.  The steak was cooked well but I found the \"Japanese Inspired Steak Sauce\" to just taste like onion and ended up scraping the lumpy sauce off the steak. Initially the fries were quite tasty with a seasoning on them but as I ate my dinner there were quite a few burnt/extremely well-done fries in the middle of the pile. I also found the fries at the bottom of the pile to be soggy.  I was also disappointed that there was no vegetable accompaniment to the meal and if I wanted to add a vegetable there were addition costs. My boyfriend was satisfied with his meal but felt the same about the fries and their varied doneness.  The atmosphere of the restaurant was interesting, not too loud but the room felt full of conversation. It was not overly busy as we went on a Tuesday night. The art on the wall was interesting to look at.  I was slightly disappointed with the seating arrangement as reservations were made for 5, we were seated at a table meant to seat 4 and the waitress pulled a chair from another table that had patrons at it to accommodate the fifth member of our party. I do not understand why the table was not ready when reservations were made. I also did not understand why we were not seated at a larger table. Lastly the table was stuck in the corner of the restaurant.  All in all, I would be willing to try the brunch menu since that is what all the rave reviews were about, but I would make sure to have reservations and maybe specify to not be sat in the corner."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch place but be prepared to sell your first born. We had the standard breakfast and ended up paying $40 with tip. How on earth did eggs, toast, and coffee add up to that! Service is good and the venue is nicely arranged. One less star for being overpriced - big time!"}
{"text":"I was excited to check this restaurant out because one of my friends always raves about it. And it lived up to my expectations entirely.  I had the most amazing quinoa risotto ($16) with butternut squash, leeks, kale, and Parmesan cheese, with shrimp added on for $6. The flavours were so rich and delicious - it was easily as good as a risotto I would have paid $30 for at another restaurant. I also split the winter squash with roasted cauliflower, sauteed leeks, pumpkin seeds, and dried cranberries with my dining companions. It was delicious, but very difficult to share. I expected it to be more of a share plate given that it was listed under \"Start and Share\" on the menu.  Other than the food, it had great service and a great vibe. Would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Brunch is a tricky meal--most patrons I think are looking to try something new, but that still adheres to certain conventions of the meal (eggs, potatoes, etc.), a balance that needs less consideration at lunch or dinner.  Lola's strikes the perfect balance: you leave filled with quality comfort breakfast food and a sense that you got something new you couldn't have ordered at a breakfast chain.  The bf got the cheesecake stuffed French toast and it was as delicious as you'd hope without it feeling as enormously heavy as you'd maybe fear.  I got the tofu eggs rancheros, which were perfect and just the right amount of heat for the first meal of the day.  The ambience is cosy and trendy, the service never left us wanting, and the other menu times looked tempting enough to guarantee another visit."}
{"text":"Great place. Gets very busy. Caesars could use some work but foods amazing. Service is hit and miss."}
{"text":"A group of 6 + 1 toddler decided to go to Lola's for brunch because their food is advertised as local and organic. We started with some delicious fresh-pressed berry juice with ginger, then we got Eggs Rancheros, burgers and Eggs benny. Everything was good. I actually had too many frites, so portion size isn't a problem. Their patio was quite nice if a little cramped, they didn't have the umbrellas out but brought us one when we asked for it. When we asked to put two tables together it wasn't an issue. Our server was really nice and even divided up the bill for us without us asking. I would go back again."}
{"text":"Everything about our visit was perfect except the food was cold; all four of us had a different hot brunch item.  Service was great, taste of the food was great, atmosphere was great, but all 4 meals were cold and it only bothered my bro enough to send his back.   I spent most of my life in Hospitality so if I can pass on 2 things to the kitchen that would have made this an amazing experience.  1) boil the water first that you use in your steam tables, first person in kitchen in a.m. put large pots of water on stove to boil right away.  If you rely on the water that comes out of the spout and the coil to then heat the water; food is gonna be cold.  2) invest in a plate warmer or put the plates in the oven to heat them.  These 2 steps would have made all the difference.  In the grand scheme of things it actually didn't affect our experience too much because it tasted great and we really enjoyed our brunch.  Definitely would return!"}
{"text":"I have tried many things here for brunch. It is always on point! They have fulfilling portions and great variety. The patio tends to get busy though, so rather than waiting, you can get a seat inside which is not bad at all."}
{"text":"After seeing all these positive reviews, I decided to give Lola's a try. It was a Sunday and we arrived around noon. It was really crowded and busy, took a while to get the hostess' attention. She wrote my name down and said she'd call me once a table was ready - about 30 minutes. I shouldn't have left the premises. Half an hour went by and we came back only to find out that we got crossed off the list because nobody answered the phone. I didn't even receive a phone call. So we ended up waiting another 20 minutes and were finally seated a little before 1pm. I was so annoyed! We ordered right away. There was no cheesecake stuffed french toast to my disappointment. I had the eggs benny and it was just ok - nothing mind blowing. They charge an extra dollar for garlic aioli. Not worth. Service was decent, nothing spectacular. It was also just so loud in there! Hard to have a conversation. I most likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Circumstances made it difficult to dislike this brunch spot. I showed up on a GORGEOUS weekday afternoon, and found my dining companion Brock M already sitting on the patio. Lola's can be found in an old white-bricked Victorian on Church, but I didn't even step inside: their quiet patio was too GD delightful in the warm sun.  I'm not one to \"fudge around\" when it comes to breakfast, so I ordered the Cheesecake Stuffed French Toast. For reasons I will never understand Brock ordered a salad. Sure, sure, he might be winning the war, I certainly took this brunchy battle. The french toast is literally stuffed with soft, creamy slabs of cheesecake and drizzled with a raspberry compote. It's the type of meal a Roman emperor would eat (nay, have fed TO him) as he ordered the grisly execution of a peon. It's DECADENT. I washed it down with an unsweetened iced tea. Oye, mamacita, it was fabulous.  The menu also indicated some breakfast wraps and bennies as well as \"straight up french toast\"? Straight up? Zzz. Get that ish stuffed. Also: pizzas, pastas, salads and other jazz rock their regular menu. It all looked amazing.  Not sure what else there is to say about Lola. That wowie-zowie opening act will be hard to follow. I want to come back to here.  Obligatory Title Pun: It's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world except for LOLA.  Menu Readability: Yeah, 'tis goed.  Need to mention: I can play Lola on guitar.  What this place teaches me about myself: I'm not the world's most masculine man, but I know what I am, and what I am is LOVER OF PATIO BRUNCHES."}
{"text":"It was a pleasant surprise to discover this hidden gym, every single dish was really good and vegan cheese cake was the highlight. It was light tasting yet sweet enough and ofcourse healthier than regular cheesecake. The patio is nice in summer but inside is very nice as well. My favourite main dish is Risotto...it is so good. I took a few friends there and they all loved it, definitely going back soon."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but.......come on..... 3 of us stopped in for brunch on a Saturday. Sat on the patio but one of us was in full sun so we asked to move inside. Staff were very accommodating and moved us (we had yet to order) 1) I ordered the eggs and bacon. Asked for egg whites only...was told \"no, we can't do that\". Then I said no eggs, just the toast, bacon and home fries. Was told no....I had to get the eggs or order the items individually off the menu. WTF? 2) due to # 1, I ordered the Granola. It was quinoa, dried cranberry, pumpkin seeds, walnuts, sliced almonds, pistachios, chia seeds, apples...all in coconut milk. It was very filling but the chia seeds overpowered the combination. Ruined what would have been a decent granola. 3) one us, after the meal, asked for a cappuccino, was told that they don't make them on the weekend, only on weekdays. We chucked, thinking our waiter was joking...he wasn't. He did come back a minute later and said he'd make one, but told us that he was doing us a huge favour.  The person who ordered the eggs Benedict said they were good....a 6 out of 10. The person who ordered crepes said they were good....an 8 out of 10. My granola I would give a 4 out of 10.   Ambiance inside was fantastic. Patio was large with ample seating. Staff members were friendly.   Would I return? Maybe.....but only to try something other than brunch. However, I wouldn't go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"I have only been here for brunch but it is always fantastic so I have been meaning to go for dinner. The service is excellent and the menu has something for everyone including great vegan choices. They have a great upstairs and the patio looks beautiful but it has unfortunately never been open when I'm there. They also have great brunch drink specials!"}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place and hey did not disappoint.  Food was delicious, the place is nice and the staff was super friendly.  Must come during weekend brunch cus they have a great menu to choose from.  I also love the fact that they have vegan options to choose from.    Will have to check this place on the weekdays."}
{"text":"Friday coworker lunch, party of 6.  We only reserved for 4, but they were flexible and had a table for 6 in no time.  I had the butternut squash soup (which is INCREDIBLY SPICY) and the gluten free fried chicken.    The soup was incredible.  Huge portion, and the sweetness of the squash was immediately answered with a raging spice that I have NEVER experienced before in my life.  I don't normally seek out anything spicy, but this really made quite an impression on me.  I will be back.  The gluten free fried chicken was pretty disappointing.  It was cornmeal (i think) dredged like how you'd fry a catfish in Oklahoma.  Kind of gritty and not what I was anticipating.  Nonetheless the soup really won me over and the onion-y mashed potatoes were bangin'.  I took the chicks home for the dog, and called it a day.   I will be back.  Oh yes, I will be back.    (they did not add gratuity for a party of 6 and yes, they split the bill, 6 fucking ways.  WOW.  Thats amazing customer service.)"}
{"text":"I normally love Lola's kitchen, today was different. I have recommend to many of my friends that this is my favourite restaurant near me. Today I added up the amount wrong. Which I would never do because this is my fav eatery. As the server took my bill, he stood at the bar giving me a dirty look and speaking to another server. I didn't think anything of it because he as a server had no personality. While finishing my last drink with my cousin, whom I treated for lunch .. We were approached by somebody who had not been working the entire time we had been there, she was sitting at the bar eating food. \" was your service and food ok? Just wondering because the server earned under 2$ tip. I was in aware and said i had tipped 10 dollars. She went to check the bill and returned. \" no you tipped him under 2 dollars\" . I quickly gave the 10 dollars I had intended but felt very uncomfortable the rest of the duration. Although I enjoy the food the way I was confronted and given dirty looks, I will not be returning. Which is sad because the staff is who made me feel so uncomfortable and embarrassed ."}
{"text":"I've been dying to pay Lola's Commissary a visit to try their famous Cheesecake stuffed French Toast for a long, long time. The restaurant is very cute with a quirky, welcoming charm. It had that kind of eclectic, artistic décor that I would want in my dream house in the future.   Now onto the food:  Stuffed grilled cheese: I always had a deep love for the humble grilled cheese, and a stuffed one was even more appealing! You would think that a stuffed grilled cheese would be infinitely more decadent than a normal one. Surprisingly, the result was not as greasy and buttery as I'd imagined it to be. In fact, I'd say that the cheese was not the star of the sandwich, but only a complementary element. In contrast, the greens definitely stood out, giving the sandwich a refreshing crunch. Nevertheless, the flavours of the stuffing worked well together and I still enjoyed the sandwich, despite it not being a greasy, buttery grilled cheese.   Lola's potatoes: a mix of diced regular potatoes and sweet potatoes. I thought that the spice mix was quite tasty and went well particularly with the sweet potatoes. On a side note, Lola's potatoes used to be called sexy potatoes, and I thought that name was a lot more quirky and appealing.   Lola's stuffed French toast: challah French toast stuffed with homemade vanilla cheesecake topped with wild blueberry compote. It was good, don't get me wrong, but it was definitely not the extraordinarily decadent monster that I had expected. The cheesecake layer was rather thin, and I also wasn't entirely fond of the prominent citrus taste in the cheesecake itself.   All in all, I was pretty satisfied with the meal, although I wished that the stuffed French toast was more decadent."}
{"text":"We had brunch here on 9/8/2013 on a perfect sunny day out on the patio.  Despite the great weather on a Sunday, there was nearly no wait.    We had the Fritata, the Benedict and the Rancheros.  The Fritata was presented well and was balanced.  The Benedict was decent but not outstanding while the Rancheros was the highlight.  It came in a taco bowl and was infused with a fantastic combination of flavours that popped with a fresh tang.  Very unique.  The service was prompt and friendly and the setting comfortable with a great neighbourhood feel.  Great brunch option."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I probably should've done better research before I suggested this place for dinner with two of my friends...Lola's Kitchen is one of those \"healthy\" restaurants, where most menu items have V/VEG/GF/some kinda healthy acronym behind them. It's not a bad thing at all, but I'm just not a very health-conscious person so the dinner menu wasn't suuuper exciting to me. All three of us ended up ordering sandwiches -- I got the grilled chicken which was very tasty, albeit a little dry. We were full and finished everything, but were all hungry again as soon as we got home!  Service was great, and the ambience is cute. It kinda feels like you're in someone's home. I'd probably like this place more if I came for brunch. I'd also probably like this place more if I cared more about my health...oh well, YOLO!"}
{"text":"I would have given this place 5 stars based on previous two experiences but not after today. My husband loves this place and their food, as do i. Today we had an off experience at Lola's. Having asked for decaf, I received it and wasn't so happy with the taste. Once the server came around to refill on my husband's coffee, I asked if I could get some regular coffee aswell and with a snippy tone the server told me that I could but that I would have to pay for it...I'm not sure if Lola's kitchen is a place where people scam for free coffee, but I clearly expected to see a charge for what I was asking for... we both found the reaction very odd and poorly delivered. Also, this time around my mushroom eggs benny was weak on the mushrooms and hollandaise (I could barely taste it). The eggs were also over cooked... so I had no yummy yolk to dip my potatoes into...my husband also was given some attitude by another one of the servers who was trying to get passed him, as my husband was trying to allow guests to pass him! We assume that the server didn't understand what my husband was trying to do but the comment and sassy attitude was unnecessary. We hope to go back to Lola's Kitchen when everyone is in a better mood! Yikes..."}
{"text":"We went here for a some brunch with my friends from downtown.  The menu is bloody hard to read with their lighting.  Considering the price we paid, all we got were looks, but the taste wasn't really there.  Heck I could get the same food in Golden Griddle, though not as much presentation and all the \"organic\", \"glutten free\" tags.  I also really hate it when waitresses offer you sauce when there's an extra charge for it that they don't talk about.  Honestly their whatever thingy with garlic sauce just tastes like mayonnaise with a little garlic in a small cup the same size as the McDonalds ketchup containers.  Not worth the $1 extra.  The food took forever to arrive.  Considering that we had to wait perhaps more than half an hour for the food to arrive, I was really miffed that they seemed to be rushing us out with the bill.  The food like I said wasn't that much better taste wise than what you'd get at Golden Griddle for 2x the cost for the amount.  If the \"art gallery\" style is one of their selling points and the price tags they had, I was going... You gotta to be kidding? Who would buy these things at that price (aside from Adam Vaughan for his office using our tax payer dollars)  If you're willing to walk another 10 minutes, Flo's diner would have better service, quality and price than this place.  I definitely won't recommend people to come here unless you just want to  expensive looking food with no real substance for the price.  (Just like Ajisen Ramen).  The only reason why it had 2 stars was unlike Ajisen Ramen, the food wouldn't make me gag."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my vegan friend. We had the chickpea burgers and they were phenomenal! I don't think I've ever had a tastier veggie burger before. The restaurant was in a cool building with tons of seating. Nice art on the walls and very classy. It looks like an expensive restaurant but it is very fairly priced. Our server, Jen, was amazing. Very attentive and cheery. Also the bathrooms were clean, which was nice to see! If you are vegan there were lots of options and we had a hard time deciding what to order."}
{"text":"The food here definitely lives up to the hype! However the service ruined our experience. Three of the staff members that we interacted with, including our waitress, were really rude. Our waitress gave attitude and never once asked us how the food was, nor did she refill our water.   This is my second time going, and I must say that the quality of service overall has definitely declined greatly."}
{"text":"Lola's is a comfortable easy going diner/restaurant that is honest and stands out from its many pretentious neighbours in Yorkville. It doesn't try to be something that it's not; it's simply yummy, good quality food.  Inside is clean, well decorated and quaint. I've been here twice now, once for brunch and another time for a work lunch. I was impressed both times. Service is great, staff is friendly and they were able to accommodate a group of 8 with only 20 minute notice despite the fact that the rest of the place was full.  It's not cheap here, but their portions are appropriately sized and the quality is fantastic. It's not an everyday lunch but a nice treat. I ordered their stuffed roasted squash with a side of chicken breast and while it was delicious, it cost about $18 after tip. I was satisfied from it so I didn't mind but if you're a big eater you may have been a bit hungry after. Meanwhile some of the guys ordered their vegan burgers and they were stuffed.  Drinks are well priced and they have daily specials. I wish they would have similar specials for lunch.... If they did, we would definitely be back more often."}
{"text":"I love this place for a couple of reasons - the beautiful décor and good service and the fact that it has amazing vegan and non-vegan options! I have tried the best red wine I've ever had - and I've had lots. I took my mom there for her birthday and she got a different wine, the result we both saw is that we did not have a headache (we're both sensitive to red wines, but thought: what the heck, it's a celebration). It's been quite some time (June) but I believe my mom got Pinot Noir and I got Malbec. They aren't even expensive at the LCBO - I purchased them a week later and same thing: no headache. Food is fresh and delicious. You can tell they didn't pre-make any salads (I tend to always get a salad). It tends to get busy so make sure you come at a good time! My favourite: Kale Caesar salad."}
{"text":"It was a Sunday morning and I found this place was perfect for a healthy brunch in hot summer day. They have many vegan/gluten-free dishes on the menu! The mushroom egg Benedict were very delicious!"}
{"text":"I came here for my friends birthday brunch and loved it!  The service was great especially considering how many of us there were and my food was delicious.   I ordered the breakfast kale bowl. It was SO good. Literally a party in a bowl. It came with eggs, sausage and different veggies including kale obviously. So so so so good. Would definitely come back! There were some other amazing sounding things on the menu I'd love to try."}
{"text":"It's my second time at Lola's Kitchen and I returned mostly for their eggs rancheros.   We only had to wait about 10-15 mins to get a table outside for brunch on a weekend, which was a pleasant surprise. The only downside of eating outside is the constant swarm of bees hovering your food. Would recommend sitting inside if possible!    I'm obsessed with their eggs rancheros which puts a Mexican twist to brunch. It's a bit spicy and tangy, so if you're not into that, would suggest ordering something else. I also always get frites because they taste great and are not a common find at most restaurants.   My friend ordered Lola's breakfast with home fries. It was average to good, nothing out of the ordinary.  We were kind of shocked to discover that they charge for ketchup.  In terms of service, we had a great waitress. The first time I went, I also received amazing service!  Overall, I would give this a 3.5 if it wasn't for charging for sauces and the bees that ruined our brunch experience. Their eggs rancheros will definitely bring me back!"}
