{"text":"Love this place. Favorites are the chicken sub, steak sub and chicken parmigiana sub. But I love everything I've tried so far. Ask for the spicy sauce if you get a sandwich/sub."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years.  Always good quality food. Anything with the homemade sausage is a winner.  Recently been getting the pizza and myself and the kids love it!  For the kids to say we want to go to Julianos for the pizza says a lot.  My only one small issue is service is sometimes a hit or miss.  Sometimes great, other times, all over the place, never bad though.  There is decent sized screen in view of pretty much every seat in the place.  
If you haven't been yet, it's definitely worth a visit.  You'll be back."}
{"text":"This place has the best subs! I was amazed by the taste of their subs! Gotta try it! Service was friendly. Tonight I'm trying their pizza on delivery..."}
{"text":"Could eat here everyday!! Best food with quality! They are popular for there subs, but I love there Pizza.. Bless to live next door!"}
{"text":"Juliano's is the place to go if you're into watching sports and actually get to eat really well at the same time. Ideal to hang out with friends. The place is clean, has nice decorations that clearly indicate \"Italian Sports Bar\" with homages to Italy as well as Canada and the Habs.

We started off with some nachos and they were really good... particularly the salsa sauce.... it was fantastic. For my main course I went with their well known sub and it was HUGE (heck, I even ordered the 7 inch!)! As in, bigger than the hoagie itself.... and that's a good thing!

The Juliano's Special had sausage, steak, mozzarella, fried onions, mushrooms, roasted peppers, tomatoes and coleslaw and it was a great sub.

They also offer Brio and that in itself was the cherry on top on the whole experience. More places need to offer Brio. BRIO. BRIOOOOOOOO!!!

We didn't take dessert as we were stuffed but I enjoyed a really well done prepared cappuccino. 

Our waitress was really sweet and friendly, the food was quickly served and the price-tag quite acceptable.

I left this place pretty happy with its existence and I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Ever since I moved to Laval, it's been my go-to bar for a yummy Bloody Mary and a delicious meal. The waitresses are super nice! My only complaint is that sometimes they would disappear and takes them a while to come check on everything. Maybe because I usually sit outside. Other than that, the place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem if you like subs. They were voted top 10 subs and it's for a reason. The sausage sub is my favorite, the pouting is pretty amazing as well. 

If you are having them deliver, make sure to ask for the coleslaw on the side otherwise the bum gets soggy!"}
{"text":"Great local resto-bar. Pizza, subs, meat platter are all excelent.  Good ambience for beer, food and friends."}
{"text":"Amazing submarines sandwiches. The portions are big, the subs are packed. My girlfriend always takes the 14 inch subs, she needs to use both hands, but she's used to it ;)"}
