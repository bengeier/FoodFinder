{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast because our regular breakfast spot was closed. The food was good, the waitress was really friendly and the restaurant was clean & quiet. It was nice to have have free local newspapers to read by the front door and there was plenty of easily accessible parking."}
{"text":"Mmm good food. I had the eggs benidict for breakfast. The egg was to over done, but it was good. Great service"}
{"text":"Add this to your list of good Gilbert breakfast places. On a busy Saturday morning, six of us were seated after only a 10 minute wait, and six of us left full and satisfied. Tender biscuits lived up to their advance reputation ( both honey and jam available to go with) and corned beef hash was fresh made. Ham steak was a generous portion as we're all the menu selections. ( Plan to take some home). Everyone had a different egg request, and everyone got eggs exactly as requested. And when was the last time you saw chipped beef on toast or Spam!!  and eggs on a menu? This is definitely homey.
The atmosphere is fresh, clean and cheerful, just as a breakfast spot should be. Recommended!"}
{"text":"This is not the same company as Biscuits Cafe on Dobson in Chandler.  We paid the same prices ($7.89 for 3 ordinary pancakes and maple flavored syrup) we would have paid for more interesting and higher quality food at Biscuits Cafe.  (I thought this was a new location of Biscuits Cafe.) The eggs were undercooked, the hash browns were the frozen variety, and the biscuit was dry--all for $8.89.  The atmosphere is no frills and dark--not what you would expect for a newly opened restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow oh wow!  I finally have a place for a great breakfast in Mesa.  I miss the original Ripe Tomato and haven't been regularly happy with a breakfast joint near me in a while.  First time in we were seated in minutes.  Our drink orders were taken and quickly delivered.  Coffee is left for us in a insulated pitcher along with a pitcher of cream.  Food was delivered in a flash as well.  My honey had the biscuits and gravy and I had the special--biscuits and gravy, scrambled eggs, bacon, and grits.  The eggs were cooked perfectly, nice and creamy!  The bacon was as well, and very lean.  This biscuits and gravy were fabulous.  Service was great!  We can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I've been to Biscuits several times and have thoroughly enjoyed it.  I had breakfast here yesterday morning with my kids.  The corn beef hash was amazing.  It came with two eggs on top along with a side item - I chose the southern style grits and also got a side of hash browns.  It also came with a homemade biscuit.  Everything was delicious!  My son got the chorizo scramble plate which he said was amazing.

I definitely recommend Biscuits for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give half a star. Terrible service, mediocre food, our server smelled like the heavest smoker in the world and two of the five of us ended up very ill shortly after eating an over priced breakfast."}
{"text":"We dined here for Father's day and upon being seated, the owner asked not one but FOUR guests who had already been served their food to move to other tables to make room for a large party of 14. He then gave free dessert to the first couple & passed the SAME dessert to the next couple upon the first couple leaving without touching the dessert. The service is terrible, the owner is incredibly disrespectful, and we will NEVER be coming back nor will the three other guests who saw everything happen dine here again either."}
{"text":"I am very impressed with this place. Service is great with nice, friendly servers. The chicken fried steak is excellent. The biscuits melt in your mouth. They even have grits that have flavor. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast with friends this morning, very good experience.  We arrived around 8am & were seated right away.  Food was outstanding & their portions are good sized. I chose the blueberry pancakes, my hubby went for the breakfast burrito (huge!) and our friends both enjoyed the biscuits special.  Typical Sunday morning breakfast size crowd and the service was very good, friendly & attentive, love the carafe of coffee on the table with a little pitcher of real cream.  Wait time between placing our orders to our food arriving was about 5 minutes.  This is a great breakfast stop, we will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Front end service was very slow. Both coming in and trying to leave. They weren't swamped either.  Our server was great! She was very friendly and prompt. The food runner brought us both out wrong and incomplete orders. It wasn't until our server was bringing us our bill that we had to opportunity to ask where the rest of our food was. She did bring the remainder out to us but by that time we were almost done eating. The food was good. Loved the French toast. We might give them a second try since the food was good."}
{"text":"The food is always great here. We've had just about everything on the menu and its always been good. The service is hit or miss but the food makes up for their short comings. Just don't be afraid to wave down your waiter if you want a refill."}
{"text":"As good as it gets for breakfast!  Tried for the first time this morning, and we were very impressed.  I had Chicken fried steak, and friend had the biscuits, and both were great.  Prices are very fair and reasonable, and the staff was friendly.  The biscuits look and taste home made (not sure if they are, and didn't ask) and the gravy was creamy, with large chunks of sausage in it.  Just like grandma used to make.  Cant wait to go there Friday for their fish fry, heard that was excellent too!"}
{"text":"Great biscuits!! Gravy was a little bland, but the biscuits are worth the trip. Also tried the house omelet with chorizo. The chorizo was pretty mild, without the distinctive flavor you look for. Hash browns were crispy without being greasy. Good value. Overall I was satisfied with the food, and the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"We walked in this morning and were never seated.  No one said a word to us at all. No, hi how are you or give us a second.  We probably stood there for at least 10 min.   We will not try again."}
{"text":"Was very good home cooking type food. We had scrambled eggs bacon home fries hashbrowns and coffee. Waitress was very nice! Yay!!"}
{"text":"My lunch crew warned me that the food and service had gone downhill. I went there with my husband for fish fry. I told him about the breakfast. However, they don't serve breakfast in the evening. They have a very limited menu.
I had the fish sandwich with fries and soup, for 9.89, my husband had the fish fry, cole slaw and fries for 9.89 (no soup or salad)
The clam chowder was awful, it tasted like corn starch and only had a couple potatoes and no clams. The fish itself was good, but the fries tasted stale. 
The breakfast might still be ok, but after such a disappointing dinner, I won't be back. It is a shame, this place used to be good."}
{"text":"Loud and uncomfortably crowded. Food quality was sub par. Tasted like everything came from a can. Do yourself a favor and go to biscuits cafe on warner."}
{"text":"I am giving the 3/6 stars. The service was good but when we were supposed to be seated the kid gave the table to someone else after the owner told him that was for us, so we had to wait again. Floor was not cleaned, and the time we paid our bill the kid keep ringing up the wrong bill. 

If I was to go back the food was amazing, but just had a not so bright host."}
{"text":"We loved it, my husband and I came here with my parents and we all enjoyed our meals. The biscuits are so yummy. This is my new favorite breakfast place."}
{"text":"Everyone says the service is excellent, and it's not bad. I'm not sure I would lead my review with it. They were attentive, but I don't know about it being over-the-top good. We had some food mishaps that they fixed for us quickly, which was nice. There is tabasco sauce in the hollandaise for some reason. It's not a lot, and I actually kind of liked it, but the person I was with who ordered it could not handle the heat. I figured that would be something you would point out in the menu.  The rest of the food was good, but nothing to write home about. Very country and very comforting, but all super heavy and nothing screamed homemade. It was a good meal, but not a great one. Would I go there again ....  maybe."}
{"text":"First visit to Biscuits with the family to celebrate a birthday after church. Food was hearty. Service friendly and quick. Tried the biscuits and gravy since other reviews raved...they were ok but not something I would order again. I would definitely go back. Large servings. Enough to share."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoy going there on the weekends for breakfast.  We also take guests when they come to town because it's close to our house and you can get a homestyle breakfast for a decent price!  They have a wide variety of classic breakfast dishes; something for everyone.  This place is by no means fancy or upscale, it's just a mom and pop restaurant with great breakfast.  The servers are always friendly and the owners do a good job with seating people on the weekend when it's busy."}
{"text":"OMG this is my first experience with this food and am lost for words it was so delicious what more can i say i will be taking my daughter here first thing tomorrow morning so she can enjoy this delicious homemade food"}
{"text":"So I live up the road, and opted to try because of the great reviews. What I found was a place that charges $2-4 over an IHOP or Denny's per plate, and unless you are buying a specialty item, which I didn't, that doesn't seem worth it for eggs and bacon. Toast cost me $2 on top of that price, making my meal a whopping $12-about $6 over what I pay at any other place. My waitress spilled water on the table and said oops and didn't pick it up. I left it to see if she would come back, and when it got to a point that it was running into my plate, I called her over for something else to see if she would do anything about it. She looked at it and just walked away. I had to pick it up myself. The icing on the cake was seeing a $40 bill for $30 in items. We said something about the bill being added wrong to the girl in the front and she admitted that it had already happened two other times that morning and the people walked out overpaying. Apparently the calculator in the back has to be \"cleared out\" or it adds on other people's tabs to yours. So they had the money to open this location, and renovate for months, but not enough to buy a decent calculator that doesn't overcharge and rip off the customers-or so they claim...hmmmm. So may I suggest instead that you try Denny's on Stapley, IHOP on Val Vista, Good Egg on Val Vista-all chains with decent service that won't rip you off. And if you're looking for a good mom/pop place and want to pay more, instead try JP's on Val Vista or The Farmhouse on Gilbert."}
{"text":"My husband ate here the other day and wanted me to write a review on his behalf - awful place! Worst biscuits and gravy ever!"}
{"text":"Best biscuits in town! I love this place! Great food! Everything I have had here is excellent!"}
{"text":"It's been hard to find great breakfast joints in Phoenix for some reason. And then I found Biscuits!!!! If you're looking to splurge on the calories and have a relaxed home style atmosphere...then this is the place! 

If you love biscuits and gravy...then you have to order them here!!! I'm pretty sure I have never had better. Eggs over easy were a little greasy, so maybe an omelet would be the better choice. Bacon is always crisp and hash browns are really good. 

Service is great. I've been 3 times and have no complaints!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the biscuit special.  I was excited because biscuits and gravy are my favorite.  Unfortunately the restaurant does not live up to its name.  The biscuits were bland (and obviously not made from scratch as claimed), the gravy had no flavor and the eggs were oily.  Our waitress was really bad as well, so that didn't help.

If you want to have a Denny's experience"}
{"text":"The benedict is made like it is supposed to be and the biscuits are AWESOME. If I lived here I would come here every day."}
{"text":"I ate her a few weeks back and I must say it wasn't the best. Our server was great, and I understand places can get busy but what I don't understand is how they feel the need to blast the A/C and keep the fans on high. We had to ask our server twice to turn our fan above us off and she replied both times saying she agrees it was cold and she will ask the manager to turn it down. The people around us started complaining about it being cold as well and then I overheard another server tell the other server \"the manager thinks it's too hot in here so he doesn't want to turn it off\". That said enough about the place for me. Good and decent food and like I said I understand it gets busy that stuff is out of their servers control but management needs a tune up."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. My whole family loves it. Very good traditional Eggs Benedict. Biscuits and Gravy are also a must. Service is prompt and courteous."}
{"text":"This place looks, smells, and is the environment of my grandparent's house in MS. The biscuits are legendary , and though I'm not a white gravy fan, This gravy was pretty good. Though the wait was not terribly long, coffee was always served fresh and hash browns are divine. 
Hey guys, COME TO BISCUITS!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this new place on a Sunday morning. Even though they were busy we only waited a few minutes. The restaurant has a country theme without the cluttered look. There are mostly booths (which I prefer) and a few tables. 
The coffee was decent and a carafe was left at table as well as a bowl of french vanilla creamer cups. I ordered the Biscuits Special which included two eggs cooked to order, biscuits and gravy, choice of potatoes, choice of meat. The biscuits were light and fluffy, and the sausage gravy tasted homemade. The hash browns were cooked perfectly; crispy without being burnt. I ordered my eggs over-medium, and the turkey sausage. Both were cooked as I liked. 
All-in-all it was a great experience. I will definitely recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Wife and I were hungry for breakfast and were going to Sam's so we thought we'd try biscuits.

Read some reviews while waiting and read about slow service, etc. We didn't experience any of that on a Sunday morning around 10:00. Place was busy clean, efficient, seated quickly (about 5-10 minutes) servers were quick, friendly. No problems there. Breakfast and lunch faire look very ordinary, about what you'd expect. Not much that looks exclusive like you'd find at Over Easy or some of those places. 

We each ordered the biscuit special. 1 biscuit and gravy (halved, so it looks like 2) , 2 eggs, meat and hash browns. Little expensive for breakfast, around $10 but portions were large. It came pretty quickly, everything was cooked well but could have used some more flavor,  Nothing disappointing but not the best breakfast I've ever had either. But was fulfilling, hearty, and a very nice experience. 

We would certainly feel comfortable recommending and we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"if my life was the tv show Seinfeld, then biscuits would be my diner. I live close and eat here often. 

I love to support local business and so do they...for example the az farm fresh eggs. 

Breakfast and lunch are great. I recommend anything on the menu. It will be fresh and it will be GOOD!"}
{"text":"Fresh from scratch food. Presentation of food was so nice. Decoration of restaurant was very cute and welcoming. Flavorful food. This was our best restaurant find. Can't say enough about friendly prompt service. This will be our must stop place whenever we are in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast, the decor was dated but the service was good, the food was good. I had the champion pancakes and my fiance had a eggs, bacon and southern potatoes. The portions were huge. No complaints."}
{"text":"They close kitchen at 1:25 in spite of sign saying open until 2:00. Lady VERY rude to me today....Entered restaurant at 1:30 on the dot and was refused service.... saying we are closing kitchen.... I had been sitting at hospital for many long hours with a friend who has cancer. 
This lady was beyond rude to me. Do yourself a favor... Try new places in Tukee ... better food & certainly respect is a given to the customer."}
{"text":"We have a regular go to when it comes to breakfast but had heard good reviews about Biscuits on Gilbert Road. After several attempts to coax my daughter into trying something new we decided on Biscuits for brunch this morning. Wow, what a mistake. Not only were my biscuits, which I think that's what they're known for by their name, so stale and hard that I could not even cut them , my daughter found a long twisted hair throughout her food. Needless to say we were both utterly disgusted and the waitress contacted the manager on our behalf. He basically just said \"this has never happened before and I'm very sorry\". I find it very hard to believe that we were singled out for this bad service. We left without eating and on our way out our waitress came up to me and told me that she was embarrassed about the whole situation. It certainly was not her fault, definitely a management issue. I cannot understand the good reviews as our FIRST and ONLY experience was HORRIBLE. Needless to say we will never go there again and I am definitely going to pass this on."}
{"text":"These Biscuits are fantastic!! The chicken fried steak w/gravy was an excellent choice as they 
do it right here."}
{"text":"Where to begin . . . The only good thing was the biscuits.  It took quite a while for our waiter to acknowledge us two other tables that were seated after us had already received their  coffee.  He came bringing water asked for our order and still no coffee.  Had to ask another waitress for the coffee.  It was brought to the table in a carafe and it was lukewarm at best.  Ordered the eggs benedict and the biscuits special.  English muffins were barely toasted and ham was deli ham, kind of gross.  The special wasnt bad but the sausage was heat and serve patties and the were barely heated.  The sausage in the gravy was chopped up heat and seve in little squares, again gross in concept but I ate it.  We will not ever be going back was an experience we will jyst chalk up . . . You know when they can't get the coffee right speaks volumes."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places! I haven't had a single thing I don't love. And the service is great!!"}
{"text":"Their sausage pork burrito was average. There literally was nothing in it but eggs and sausage. The biscuits and gravy was a delicious. Their hashbrowns... Yuck , They were way too buttery and tasted funny. Overall I would give this place another try. The service was friendly. I just hope someone from their staff reads this and does something about their hashbrowns."}
{"text":"It wasn't bad.  We really like finding non-chain breakfast places and the whole family enjoyed their meal.  I agree with several reviews that the signature biscuits were just so-so."}
{"text":"I came across this place at the suggestion of a co worker and we decided to have an office breakfast there. I was not disappointed! From the moment we walked in we were treated with kindness and genuine appreciation. Our orders were taken promptly and unlike other places when serving a bigger party, no one confused our orders or where there any mix ups. I ordered the French toast combo after much debate (everything sounded great). When the plate arrived it had a little too much butter for me but albeit that, it was great. The sides were also great and the service very attentive. The best part was the price! I had a very satisfying meal for $8, that made me happy! I have nothing bad to say about my dining experience here. The manager came out and made sure everything was great and asked if there was anything he could do for us. I will definitely go back whenever I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical going in because of previous reviews, but I was very surprised! The food was great! I got the homemade corned beef hash. So good, not to greasy and the english muffin that it came with was a REAL english muffin. Egg were cooked to the T. I will be back."}
{"text":"Ok - lesson learned... We are going split our breakfast next time.  They deliver HUGE plates of breakfast so you better be hungry.  The chicken fried steak has a nice crispy coating with tender meat inside.  The country potatoes have great flavor and the biscuits are so light and yummy."}
{"text":"Very good biscuits and gravy, excellent coffee, english muffin was toasted to perfection. The service was polite and super fast. All at a fair price, especially with the large portions."}
{"text":"Food was ehhhh! Nothing to brag about and whole wheat pancakes were blah! Kids menu was expensive for 3.99 for one  Mickey Mouse pancake and one sausage. DRINK not INCLUDED!"}
{"text":"This is a review of the Friday night fish fry, not for breakfast. The service was terrible. The waitress never came back around to fill our drinks. The clam chowder was ok but tasted like a canned soup I could buy at the grocery store. We ordered the catfish. It was the worst fish I have ever tasted in my entire life. It had the texture of boogers when you ate the fish by itself. The breading was overwhelming and when removed the fish was even more terrible on its own. The fries were of poor quality, tasting like fast food fries. We left without even finishing our meals. We were disappointed and grossed out the rest of the night by our experience. Will not go back for fish fry ever again and will not recommend to others!"}
{"text":"Biscuits is a great breakfast/lunch place. Be prepared to wait on Sat/Sun mornings but it' always been worth it. Friendly but busy staff, free coffee while you wait and they always say they are sorry for making you wait.  

The decor is back home country. Reminds me of my grandma's kitchen. 

The food is good, and a huge plus for having chicken fried chicken for breakfast, that means no more having to go to nasty cracker barrel for it!  

I love the country gravy, love the chicken fried chicken. The grits seem pre-sweetened and I can see how people might not like that, myself I am all good with that. Now the one downer is the Biscuits, I am not a huge fan, they are huge and heavy. I myself like the lighter ones. 

I've had breakfast and lunch items both there and all have been lovely. My best friend swears by the corned beef hash, he orders it as an add on to everything and anything he gets there. 

You can eat and get beyond full for two for about 20 bucks and that is a huge plus for me. 

The only bad thing we ever got there was a cinnamon roll for my son. He said it was nasty and couldn't get past one bite, he said it tasted like a hard roll with some funky icing.  I have never myself tried it but it didn't look that good honestly. But hey, if that is the only minus for them I am ok with that!

I would totally suggest getting over here and give them a try, they are also open late on Friday and Sat's for fish frys!"}
{"text":"I just dropped in while running between appointments. Good to average. Very quick from ordering to receiving. In and out less than 30 mins. Pretty good food, fairly priced. Atmosphere OK, nothing special but clean."}
{"text":"Great breakfast just like Mom makes! Buttery eggs, the biscuits are a must and all the staff are very friendly! This is my new favorite breakfast spot and will definitely go back to try the fish fry!"}
{"text":"Not worth the time or money.  There are much better places in the neighborhood.  Weak coffee. Huevos Rancheros is disappointing.   I can't believe people actually wait for a table for anything over 5 minutes for such mediocre food."}
{"text":"I am totally disgusted with this restaurant. 

I first visited this restaurant last weekend after hearing good things about their food. My visit was enjoyable- the food was delicious and tasted like it was made from scratch. The waitress was nice and the prices were reasonable. I was excited about my visit so I told invited a friend to join me the following weekend.

My friend and I went for breakfast this morning (now a week later) and it was like I went to an entirely different restaurant. The place was busy but we were able to get a table immediately. The waitress was in a bad mood from the time we sat down. My friend ordered coffee and juice and the waitress looked at her like she was crazy. She came back 3 times within 5 minutes to ask if we were ready to order after we told her we needed time. She was annoyed that my friend needed more time and then asked a question about the menu. I know it must have been terribly inconvenient for the waitress to do her job. The food came out in about 20-30 minutes. The food tasted good, just like my last visit. When we were only half way through our food, she brought us our bill and asked us if we needed anything else. We told her we were fine, but were just finishing our food and chatting. She came by 5 times in 10 minutes asking if we needed anything else so we would hurry up and pay the bill and leave. She had another waitress come ask us if we needed anything else within those 10 minutes as well. Then, my friend took out her card and had it on the table and I was getting out my card and the manager came and without saying a word grabbed the bill and walked away. I tried to stop him but he wouldn't turn around. I had to flag down the waitress to bring our bill back as we had two separate bills and my card hadn't been added yet. Then, the hostess, who is probably the snootiest young lady I've ever met came and said \"can I take this\" referring to the book t hat the bill is held in and didn't wait for a response before grabbing it and walking away. She came back saying she needed the other receipt and I told her I wasn't done yet but I would leave it when I was. I could see the manager, and several of the staff pointing and talking about us (on more than one occasion) at the hostess station which was 3 booths away.  I have never felt so bullied at a restaurant in my entire life!

Since when is it a crime to talk with your party when you are out a restaurant? We were only there for about 1 1/2 hours from the time we sat down to the time we left which is not an exuberant amount of time. Furthermore, there were many open tables elsewhere. Regardless of whether there are tables open or not, there is no reason for a restaurant staff to bother guests to get them to leave. The manager has no place in management. 

The only reason my waitress got a tip was so the hard working buser got a portion of the money. She certainly didn't deserve one.

The restaurant deserves an F in manners, customers service, atmosphere, hospitality, and professionalism. I'm completely embarrassed that I spoke so highly of it to my friend who had to experience such terrible and rude service. 

Good luck staying open."}
{"text":"Portions were large. Had the 3 egg cheese omelet with SO many fried potatoes AND a biscuit. All of it was fresh and hot; potatoes a little greasy. Biscuit was light and fluffy. Service was prompt but staff seemed a little brow-beat by hostess. Seemed like the place could use a little redecorating; it's a bit dated. But filled our stomachs before we had to catch a flight until we got home."}
{"text":"This place is very close to home, while its been many other restaurants. We tried it again when all other breakfast places were so busy. Walked in place was semi busy, we were sat right away. 
Menu was a read..but liked the choices. I had a omelet and it was perfectly prepared with bacon and it was filled with bacon! It was cooked wonderfully. I can't stand crispy omelettes or burned eggs. The pancakes were also good! We went again a week later, omelettes were just as good veggie with pancakes and coffee. All well worth coming back! 
Only thing I'd recommend is refill on drinks, especially in the summer. Make sure you ask for water as well. Seems once they give you the check...and the food arrives.. so will your check, and your done. Waitress does not come back? If you fix this then your beyond 5 stars."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! We have had excellent service every time we have been here. We used to go to the Gilbert location but love that this one opened closer to our house! I am a big fan of the fact that the food is local and organic. We have brought our out of town guests and they loved it as well. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast place. The food is good. They have the best biscuits & gravy of any restaurant I have eaten at. The wait staff is friendly. The only complaint I have is that Sunday mornings are packed, so there can be a wait to be seated."}
{"text":"I don't get it. What's the big deal with this place? 

The coffee is atrocious, the food is greasy, the owner is completely checked out  and the place is disgusting. 

Dirty and/or empty condiment bottles. Filthy, fingerprinted menus to go with the barnyard shabby chic decor. 

Ick! The entire place need to be degreased and disinfected. Crappiest food in Ahwatukee.

I am debating on calling the Food & Safety Administration and getting an inspector down there ASAP.

Here is the last inspection they participated in. More often than not, then are NOT participating or making any efforts to exceed health code standards. See the last two inspection reports:

{"text":"The red headed waitress was almost militant.  She was kinda bossy and although she said all the right words her niceness honestly seemed like it was only because she was getting paid.   She has been there since day one and has been the same on the other two occasions I have eaten there. There were 5 of us which evidently results in a 20% mandatory tip.  Everyone like their fish and shrimp and chips.  My Huevos Rancheros was VERY salty.  This was a real shame because otherwise it would have been very good.  Now, the reason for my two star rating.........MANDATORY 20% TIP!  So the waitress was going to get a good tip no matter what.  We paid some cash and some debit cards.  The waitress came back to tell us we were 83 cents short ...........REALLY?   We all had to scramble in our purses, digging for change while she stood there and patiently waited for her 83 cents.  If it had been me, and I was already getting a nice fat tip I would have let the 83 cents go.  It really just made the whole experience bad.  I will not be rushing back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Service was good. Pancakes best I've ever had. Grits I would rate a ten. Would recommend everyone try."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try for  long time, think it's been in Gilbert for about a year now.  Very glad my wife stopped in this morning. Our host...John...was a trip, funny and helpful.
Very fun menu with so many things I want to try now.  Wife had pork chop and eggs and I had the hamburger and eggs, both were perfect and the country potatoes, defiantly home made!
This is the place I'm taking my friends,forget about Over Whatever!"}
{"text":"I had eggs Benedict with hash browns. Lots of salt in every component: hollandaise, biscuit, hash browns. The eggs were swimming in hollandaise. My husband had biscuits and gravy and he was disappointed with the flavors, overcooked hashbrowns, junky sausage AND too much pepper in the gravy, and dense biscuits. He also said the coffee was worse than gas station coffee. I thought even the water tasted gross. The only redeeming qualities were their wait staff who are supremely kind and very quick, and it is decorated sort of cute."}
{"text":"For fat laden 50's-era diner food in a nondescript atmosphere, this is the place.  The food is perfectly adequate. So is the service. My complaint is with the congregation of LOUD TALKING servers who hung around the hostess stand yesterday while they waited for something to do. They were so loud and obtrusive that my husband and I gave up trying to have our own conversation. Ladies,   please gossip about your coworkers on your own time. We don't care that ___ didn't split his tips with you. Lower your voices and allow your customers a quiet dining experience. Comfort food means nothing if you can't hear yourself think while trying to eat it."}
{"text":"The blueberry pancakes were massive and loaded with blueberries. My two fellow eaters were quite satisfied with their food, too. Our coffee was repeatedly topped off and the pot refilled. A very good Sunday morning, although a wait under 30 minutes is tough to avoid."}
{"text":"This place is really good.  I have been eating there frequently since they opened, and the food has always been great!  Any issues are immediately taken care of.  Staff is very friendly.  Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"When we get the craving for that home cooked comfort food, this is where my wife and I go. The menu is all good old fashioned food, and there are times I appreciate a straight forward meal that hasn't been messed with.

1. I do like the food, a lot. This is the type of meal the chain restaurants try to copy and market as \"home cooking\", that stuff doesn't hold a candle to the real deal.

2. The service is outstanding. The staff is so nice, one of the servers has become an auntie to our 1 yr old son. He just beams every time he sees her.

3. I really like that it's local and they use local and organic whenever they can. A big plus for me.

4. Spam. They have a WW II Spam & eggs breakfast plate on the menu that I just had-to, had-to try. How does it get more home cooking than that? Oh, by having S&!# On a Shingle, that's how.

5. I grew up in small farming communities in the Intermountain West, so this place felt like home to me. Forget the douchebaggery, this place is as real as it gets."}
{"text":"Sorry I came. Weird flavor on the country potatoes-couldn't eat them. Sausage patty undercooked and nearly flavorless. Hash browns also flavorless. Won't be back."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic! It is fresh with quality ingredients and cooked to order. I always order the chicken-fried-chicken breakfast. Chicken is moist and juicy with the right amount of and well seasoned crispy breading. Eggs are cooked perfectly to over easy, as I order them. The biscuit, fluffy, substantial, moist and flavorful. Hash browns are somewhat inconsistent; they've been overcooked or slightly burnt occasionally. Whoever joins me at Biscuits enjoys the quality and taste of whatever they order. 

Go for the food, it is homemade and great tasting!

Service is great, except for one unprofessional server (female, shorter, thin with chin length red hair). If not for the server, I would have given 5 Stars. This server has been somewhat snippy on two occasions she was assigned to my table. Another time she could be heard from my table half way across the restaurant near the front door spewing negative, and incorrect information about healthcare policy (keep your politics to yourself in places of business - not all of us agree with you). Twice, she was at the cashier station and did not acknowledge or thank me. Most recently, as I approached and handed her my credit card and check, she took them and processed the transaction while continuing a conversation with another server complaining about a server who was scheduled for the upcoming Sunday who was not needed, in her opinion. She was so worked up that she flipped/threw my receipt on the counter at me, oblivious she was interacting with a person, nonetheless a customer. I took my receipt and left. She did not thank me, make eye contact, just yapped on in an irritated tone with negative body language. This weekend, the customers a table near me left as soon as their meal was served without eating it. I overheard them tell the host they were not pleased how this same server responded to their complaint of underdone pancakes. The server jumped in and said, \"I didn't mean it,\" and walked away. I hope the owners, who seem very nice and professional, are aware/become of the continually problem server and act accordingly.

The weekday regular busser is efficient, professional, and pleasant, as are the other servers. 

Biscuits gives back in a nice way too....discounts to all veterans, past or present."}
{"text":"Just barely okay.
I ordered the Traditional breakfast.  Country potatoes were cool and mushy not hot and hearty.  Bacon was also cool and kinda flavorless, not sure how you can even do that.  Eggs were hot and cooked to order (over easy). I opted for the biscuit with my meal and was pretty good but not great, as you would expect from the name.   Waitresses were nice and happy.  Confused by so many \"great\" reviews here.  I'm pretty sure this was not a \"one off\" experience.   Another reviewer mentioned that it didn't smell like a breakfast restaurant, and they're right...very odd.  Perhaps preparing some of the food in smaller batches throughout the service would help?
Sorry but mediocre at best."}
{"text":"A good little b fast place nice value for the portions service was fast staff was friendly"}
{"text":"I went there yesterday for the first time and had the Eggs Benedict.  OUTSTANDING.  Hash Browns were perfectly seasoned and very tasty.  The hollandaise sauce was to die for and I wish I had toast to sop up every last drop. 

My sister thought every thing was a bit salty but she seasoned before tasting so my advice is to taste first then season as we get used to the chain restaurants to under season everything. 

This is a place that I have to come back so I can try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Good menu.  Items you really don't see any more.  Everything well prepared and good portions.  Onion rings were awesome"}
{"text":"Had breakfast there yesterday. Service was great but food less than average. Had the American breakfast. Eggs greasy, country potatoes were soggy and the bacon was greasy and overcooked. I gave it 2 stars because the service was great but the food very unappealing. Not a patch on Village Inn and I thought expensive for the poor quality food."}
{"text":"Food and service was great, the biscuits were tasty with honey. The variety of food was also nice"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here this morning expecting it to be like so many other places we've ate at for breakfast, just so so.  Wow were we surprised!  This is an awesome little jewel of a place.  Very friendly staff with extremely tasty food. I ordered 2 eggs, bacon, country potatoes and blueberry pancakes.  Everything was perfect no salt, pepper or hot sauce was required.  My husband ordered corned beef hash.  He was very pleased.  Said it was some of the best he'd had.  Which is definitely a compliment coming from him!  Lol!  We will be returning soon to try another tasty dish!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place.  The blueberry pancakes were really good, and the Champion cakes looked amazing.  Really generous portions and the biscuits, of course, were fabulous."}
{"text":"Service was a  it slow, but it was packed on a Sunday for brunch. I ordered the biscuits and eggs, and it was sooo delicious. Will definitely come back to try a different menu item. I was worth the wait. Everything looked so appetizing."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, breakfast menu is the way to go - but -  the service was horrible, very slow and it took them 35 min to bring me a water.  This was a monday morning.  I've been here before and loved it but today I was annoyed and not impressed with the waitresses who seemed to not care about anything."}
{"text":"There biscuits and gravy are awesome.... And the service here is the best that I have seen a while.. I look forward to trying more of there food...."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to eat breakfast! The biscuits and gravy are awesome, as well as the bacon and eggs! Clean and good service too!"}
{"text":"Super awesome menu and great service.  I had the south mountain scramble. Highly recommended. Fresh coffee and clean place. My son had their pancakes which were very tasty. The fried steak was superb !! Will be back"}
{"text":"Just had breakfast here, omelet and pancakes....food was great!! Kinda like a ma n pa place..a bit pricey for breakfast but portions are big..."}
{"text":"LAURA WAS INCREDIBLE! Service was excellent. The burger was a huge surprise as it was one of the best burgers I've ever had. Definitely going to be a regular meal for me from now on. Arguably the best breakfast spot in Ahwatukee!"}
{"text":"Had the biscuits special it was really good and a big portion of food. Ordered a side of sausage which I shouldn't have cause it was a lot of food. County style potatoes are the way to go!!! My lady had the eggs Benedict and it was alright little too buttery. Our daughter had the kids Mickey Mouse pancake it was big too and very good and fluffy. It's a little pricey but you do get what you pay for good food and large portion. Would go back again."}
{"text":"Good food and service. I had the breakfast special,  ham and potatoes. About $12 including tax. I will go back again."}
{"text":"Typical diner-style breakfast joint. Nothing special about their menu but the food is consistently good. They are happy to make your omelettes as you'd like them, so we always opt for omelettes cooked dry (skip the extra 300 calories in oil, please) and filled with varying veggies."}
{"text":"UNBELIEVABLY good!  Possibly the best pancakes I've ever had, the \"Champion Pancakes.\"  Made with whole wheat batter, tons of sliced almonds, granola, cinnamon, and blueberries - all stirred into the batter.  I asked for no butter, and they were completely non-greasy.  There are several fruit syrups to choose from as well as REAL maple syrup.  Good grits!  Good, \"country potatoes\" made fresh, not frozen.  Fresh-squeezed orange juice.  Next time, I'll try the fresh blueberry muffin or the frosted cinnamon roll, but I won't skip those pancakes!
Super wait staff - really friendly and prompt.  
A comfortable, spacious, no-hurry atmosphere.  Not the \"eat and get out\" I've experienced at the chain restaurants.  
Easy to find - right off the interstate.  Large parking area - restaurant itself is right next to a strip mall.
I'll be returning each time I visit Phoenix.  

Breakfast & lunch...dinner on Friday & Saturday.
15% discount for veterans!"}
{"text":"Having had the pleasure to have eaten here at the Biscuits here in Tempe on more than a dozen times, I felt compelled to write a review to let everyone know just how extremely glad I am to have found a place like Biscuits so close to where I live.
 It's hard to decide where to start, the food here is so good that words alone can't begin to describe just how much of a delight it is to eat here, the Meatloaf with mashed potatoes are by far the best I've ever eaten along with the Pulled BBQ Pork sandwich, substitute the French fries with Onion rings, country green beans and Cole  slaw or maybe the Oriental Chicken Salad and the Fish and Chip's, Alaskan Cod cooked to perfection to name a few.
 Let's not forget the service staff that work here, they are some of the best, friendliest and professional around making sure that you get your food quickly and correctly so that you have one of the best dining experiences possible. Everything about this place makes it an easy choice to keep coming back. I just can't say enough to express my delight in having found Biscuits in Tempe."}
{"text":"When we were finished with our food. The server gave us the check and asked if we wanted a box. We said yes. Then 10 minutes later she says \"do you guys need anything else? Because we're busy and we need the table\" I've never been told this before and I don't think that's good customer service. The food was good."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE! 

My son asked if they had white cheese for his omelet,  woman said, only swiss... I cut in, \"leave the cheddar jack, just light cheese please\" ..... 

Of COURSE she dropped off an omelet covered in swiss ... I told her that's not what we ordered & this broad takes if to the kitchen, has the cook scrape off exactly 3/4th of the Swiss and a sprinkle of cheddar jack ............... Look,  this is my child for one & 2. That's disgusting,  did he use his fingers to pull the cheese? Why leave it all over the omelet? I asked her to make a new one and she goes in the kitchen and CLEARLY STATES, \"Well he ordered swiss in the first place!\" to the cook loud enough for the restaurant to hear.  Including myself. My kid is 16, he knows what he eats, never had swiss or ordered it a day in his life.

Requested a manager, got the omelet remade.  

Food was really good but the service is the reason I won't ever be back. 

If I knew the woman's name, I'd tell you never to sit in her section."}
{"text":"This Breakfast place is phenomenal!  I got the Corned Beef Hash and eggs and it was amazing. I would recommend this place to everyone. Definitely worth every penny spent here."}
{"text":"OMG!! The BEST!! We had the special, eggs beni and French toast combo! 
Hollandaise sauce is AMAZING 
Scrambled eggs soo fluffy and buttery and French toast was perfect! 
Then there was our server Laura!! She was sooo attentive and friendly!! Next time we come down from Prescott we are coming to see these fine ladies!!"}
{"text":"The food Is pretty tasty only concern is the cleanliness each time I've been there my daughter she consistently must send her lipstick traced cups (with whole lips)on her cup!!!  I believe it's RED#5.. And and utensils are not mouth worthy! So though the food is somewhat flavorful you must ask the question WTH..."}
{"text":"*Do Not Let The Wait Scare You Away!

To sum up our experience in 1 word: Superb! This place is just fantastic. We have been wanting to try this restaurant for awhile. Tried going a couple weeks ago but the line was too long for a party our size. Tried again last Sunday and only had a minimal wait. It was well worth it.
All the employees were very friendly. Our waitress was patient and helpful. The prices were reasonable and selection vast. The wait for the food to come out after we ordered was pretty minimal for how busy they were. And the most important part, the taste... Well that was just perfect!  I wish we had room to eat more because it was that good.

Forget the plain ole run of the mill Denny's and Ihop... You must give Biscuits a try, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"First time here. Recommended by staff the breakfast burrito. Hot, fresh, salsa with just the right zing= yum! Haven't tried the biscuits yet, but will be back."}
{"text":"Food is good, but service is horrible. The server took our order pretty quickly, but food took a while to come out. When it did get to us every one received their order except one person in our party (simple order of oatmeal). By the time the server came back to us (we flagged her down) we had all finished eating. Never once asked if we needed anything else (drinks were empty, no extra napkins, etc). 
Also, skip the coffee....it's like colored water."}
{"text":"I love this place! Service is great and food is always awesome! They can get busy on the weekends so plan to go early or call ahead."}
{"text":"Had a lovely brunch! Got in just before the lunch rush on a sunday so get in at NOON you'll notice people start coming in groups little after noon.

I had porkchops and egg breakfast with a single pancake. Meal was great eggs were perfect and biscut was so soft and flakey. Pancake was WAY bigger than I thought and kind of regretted getting now since I couldn't finish it. My only bad thing was the porkchop was a little tough for my tastes but still tasty. My boyfriend had the jalapeno alfredo that has to be the best thing on the menu. Delicious! You get the creamy alfredo taste immediatly then this slow addition of the jalapeno taste. I didn't think it was spicy but my boyfriend was sweating so if u order it it may be different based on your spicy level.

Our waitress was really nice and the entire staff there is so inviting. I watched I think who was the owner make rounds and chat it up with everyone. Groups of people there were addressed by name so they must be regulars. I hope to become one as well. Thanks for the lovely breakfast!"}
{"text":"I've been there two times now. I'm a big lover of biscuits and gravy. There's are pretty good. They are very \"midwest\" -- meaning thick and homemade. I love the biscuits as well. If you ask for Biscuits and Gravy you will get two big biscuits split in 1/2 and covered generously with gravy. PLENTY for 2 people and I'm a big eater! 
My husband really likes the place too. 

We got good service, friendly and it was affordable. 

I will go again, despite what a few are saying, I haven't experienced that. Maybe they are not conosuers of biscuits and gravy from \"back home.\" But since I am...I give it 4 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! They are always friendly and the food comes fast. I have never had a problem here. I can't describe the food other than delicious!! They remember my sons name and are always welcoming."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend after a Saturday morning workout, and was really looking forward to my meal, as I heard the food was good. As we sat down to read the menus we were greeted by an unfriendly face and a furrowed brow. Our server was impatient and short with us from the start. I was slow to make an opinion as we all have our bad days, but after the rude comments she made to my friend and slamming the water pitcher down next to me when I asked for more water, I realized it had gone too far. While the food was good, it was not good enough to excuse the poor service and treatment we received from our waitress I believe she also had some involvement with the owner/management side of the business as well. The kind of treatment we received was inexcusable regardless of the popularity of food served. There are just too many good breakfast places around town that give you better service with better food. I usually don't like to write bad reviews on people or restaurants, but hopefully this review will help spark a change in service."}
{"text":"The worst biscuits cold coagulated gravy I have ever paid for.. the croud was older than me... 57... and I guess snuck out of their nursing home.. that's  the only reason why they ate that... never again...."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service.  Thought that the biscuits and gravy was delicious. Not for the health food conscious, but a great treat if you're looking for an ooey gooey plate of yumminess. The grits were even smooth and A OK. I'd come back here for another treat."}
{"text":"Whether I've had breakfast or lunch, the food is awesome. Friendly and fast service. Very clean. Couldn't be happier!'  Eat there once or twice a week. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the neighborhood and I've now found my local breakfast place. So cozy amd homey. The service was great. The server was very helful and super nice as well. So many great choices! I plan to try something different every time! They even serve lunch too."}
{"text":"Our families favorite place to eat. Great food, excellent service! Big portions! Reasonable prices !"}
{"text":"I used to love this place their breakfast is usually very tasty.   I am a bit disappointed they didn't do anything to Veterans Day besides their usual 10% off the veterans meal.  I took my husband for a Veterans breakfast.  The person who greeted us was not friendly and let out the biggest sigh when I told her we had 7 people in our party.   It wasn't just us however the people after us also got the cold greeting.  Food was great!  When we got our checks the waitress included gratuity well over 20%.  We did not have problem as we usually tip around 20% but for her to go over that amount was not very nice.  Food wise I would give this place a 5 Star.   Staff with the exception of the nice bus boys brings this down to 3."}
{"text":"We were cruising through town and randomly picked Biscuits. After enjoying the fantastic breakfast (and delish milkshakes!) I noticed that not only did our waitress make certain that we were taken care of, everyone that walked by the table always made certain that we had full drinks, if we needed anything, etc. 

Biscuits team of upbeat, positive servers and staff were fantastic and made this a five star experience for all of us! What a team!! It was so great, we ended up going back again the next day. Go Biscuits!"}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow, but very friendly. And the food made the wait worth it! I had the SOS (chipped beef in gravy on biscuits) with a side of sliced tomatoes, my boyfriend had the chicken fried steak with grits. Both were absolutely delicious. The biscuits were fluffy and dense and the grits I thought were especially good. My only complaint was that I couldn't eat it all!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best breakfast places in Ahwatukee.  Everything I've had has been great. Prompt service and friendly staff keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"If you love biscuits and gravy this is the place for you. Their pancakes are also delicious!"}
{"text":"This place has breakfast that is like your momma's kitchen (if your momma can cook :-)

I like Cracker Barrel, but in my opinion, Biscuits has them beat. The staff is really friendly.

I've eaten: Eggs, pancakes, turkey sausage, Chirozos w/scrambled eggs, steel-cut oatmeal, fried catfish, and of course biscuits - and will be back to try everything else on the menu!

The important thing that has to be done now, is that we keep eating here, so that they will stay open  -or-  the option will be: don't keep eating here and let it close down and be stuck eating corporatization food."}
{"text":"So went here for the first time ever and first thing the service was amazing she was very nice and just all around great. The food now that was amazing bacon let me tell you out of this world good biscuits are awesome should've gotten two. The champions pancakes if your Hungry this is the plate fresh blueberries is what makes it. I would totally come here again"}
{"text":"Ate here because we were hungry and it's in the same parking lot as Sam'sClub, which was our destination. The food was mediocre at best, and the service was worse. I had chicken strips and didn't think to ask for dipping sauce, and I was in the restroom when the server took our food to the table. He did tell my husband that they had either BBQ sauce or ranch dressing, but he NEVER came back to our table until we were finished and he brought our check. My husband said his food was lacking in flavor. The ketchup bottle had a Heinz label, but I'm thinking they either refilled it with a generic brand or they watered it down to make it last longer. The restaurant was clean, but it didn't even smell like we were in a restaurant. Weird. Needless to say this is one establishment that we will not visit again."}
{"text":"I love coming here but I can't do it often because the biscuits and gravy are so sinful that I can finish a whole plate by myself. There is also usually a wait, but it's worth it and I love taking my out of town guests here. Irresistible."}
{"text":"Breakfast is our thing, and it is apparent that it is Biscuits thing as well!  The food is great and so is the service.   We will eat here again!"}
{"text":"A wait? Excellent service? Best biscuits ever? Are these people talking about the same place we visited? It hardly seems possible.

First, we went on a Saturday morning and were seated right away, there was no indication there might have been a wait and we were among 10 customers in the restaurant the entire time we were there.

Second, the service was adequate and that was all. I had to ask to have my glass of tea refilled, twice which is not a good sign in my book. While our server was friendly he seemed more interested in his cell phone, (we could see him standing by the kitchen window texting), than in checking on how we were enjoying our meal.

Third and most importantly the food was dreadful. The biscuit while large was neither flaky nor tasty but rather a baked blob of heavy dough. The omelet was over cooked and the filling items were stingy.

From the glowing reviews and beautiful pictures some people have posted about this place I was expecting good, hearty, flavourful food but alas an Egg McMuffin would have been more satisfying. We will never return to this establishment.

If you are hunting a wonderful brunch may I humbly suggest T.C. Eggington's in Mesa. Yes you will have a wait there but at least you will have 5 star service and food for your reward."}
{"text":"Usually have a good breakfast here. But today it was horrible the eggs were burnt the ham was charbroiled the biscuits and gravy were gross. The waitress forgot part of our order she was very confused today my husband ordered tortilla and got a biscuit. He ordered orange juice she brought him iced tea with lemon. I ordered decaf coffee and got full strength fill carafe. She brought my mom her decaf though one cup. Just wasn't a good day for biscuits today."}
{"text":"Great food even better service good location but only gave 4 star because it could use a new look (something more inviting)."}
{"text":"Love this place! We only get to go when we have a weekday off because it is always packed on the weekend. Yummy food! My son had pigs in a blanket, I had the biscuits and gravy and my husband had the house omelet. Yummy! Yummy! Yummy!"}
{"text":"We drove by one afternoon on the way home (to East Mesa).  The window says open until 8:00 on a Friday night.  We finally had the chance to come back this week, and when we got there at 7:30, the doors were locked.  What the #$%???  We were just driving away, when another car pulled up and both patrons walked up to the door and discovered it locked as well. After knocking on the window, a woman came out.  Although they say they're open until 8:00, they lock the doors before then (apparently, even before 7:30) so as to avoid any extra diners, and perhaps allow the staff to leave the restaurant at 8:00.  Wake up!!!!  If you say you're open until 8:00, you need to leave the doors unlocked until that time!!!  That doesn't mean that the staff gets to clock out at 8:00!!!  I was hugely disappointed, and won't be going back.  I wonder if the owner knows that the manager is closing-up-shop and turning customers away because they want to get out of there at a decent hour???"}
{"text":"We ordered coffee....nothing ever came to the table....the end. They were short staffed and needed help. Place needs a renovation as well. I hope they turn things around."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. They also support the military and veterans with a discount. Loved the SOS."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.  Staff was courteous and efficient.  Food was excellent.  Grits were the best I have had, and that is from one that lived in the south.  Highly recommend this restaurant for breakfast.

Menu has some really different items on it.  Reuben omelette  (with sauerkraut!),  WWII spam, SOS and of course delicious biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"The BEST waitress in the valley is Kodi!!!!
I've never been here before, the food was awesome and the waitress was fun and upbeat!!!! The French toast was delicious (made with Hawaiian bread)!!
You need to get here, ask for Kodi and get the French toast!!"}
{"text":"I've visited there second times and each time the food has been awesome, the staff very cordial no matter how busy it is!"}
{"text":"biscuits???
how is the name of your restaurant biscuits and you run out of biscuits?! horrible wait staff, was not warned of the biscuit outage till already sat down and ordered."}
{"text":"Mind = blown. 

Had a great chicken fried steak, and the biscuits are to DIE for. Great service with a smile from Pam!

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Never had anything bad here. Food comes out quick, it is hot and delicious. Staff is very friendly and service is exceptional."}
{"text":"Great diner, great food, great friendly service. Love a place that gives you your own coffee pot. Everything was hot and tasty. Only reason for not 5 star rating was the bitter tasting coffee. Arbuckles coffee from Tucson would be my suggestion for superior smooth tasting coffee. I noticed others on yelp said the same thing about the harsh taste. Yes I do plan on revisiting soon. I will just pass on the cup o joe. They did win the best eating place award in their neighborhood this past week and well deserved in my opinion."}
{"text":"My snowbird parents found this place first. The food is awesome! The service is great and the owner is pretty cool too! So get out of bed and check this place out!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. My family went there a couple of weeks ago on a late Sunday morning. There was a short wait but it wasn't too bad. The atmosphere was warm and homey. However, everything changed when we met our server. I wish I could remember her name. She was probably one of the rudest waitresses I have encountered. I hate to say that because my husband is also a waiter and I know how difficult it can be. Anyway, the food was pretty good but comparable to Denny's. I don't know if I want to go back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the biscuit breakfast! The biscuits are perfect and the sausage gravy it spicy and delicious. My scrambled eggs were cooked perfectly and were light and fluffy. The French toast is really the best part."}
{"text":"First time but not the last time here.  Great food good service.  Down home cooking.  I always have to try the pancakes when I go somewhere new. So i had the eggs, pancakes and bacon combo (my usual). The pancakes here are flavorful and filling.  Not as light as I like, but not so heavy they weigh you down.  I also had to try the biscuits and gravey and was not dissappointed.   We will be back, net time for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is THE place to be! YAAAAASSSS! The food, the drinks and the STAFF - AMAZING!!! I highly recommend this place to anyone who loves good food.  You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Server,  Pam     , was great as usual. Backn crisp, SOS good and over easy eggs as should be! Coffee is the best of any restaurant I've tried."}
{"text":"Nasty breakfast.  Over salted biscuit, dense pancake and greasy potatoes.I know there is a place for this type of comfort food, but it sure isn't in my stomach.  There are lots of other places for people with a more discerning palate.   This is heart attack food and judging by the size of the people in there, the local heart surgeons will be plenty busy. 

Sorry, but I prefer fresher and heather choices."}
{"text":"I really like when a place serves late breakfast, since it's my fave meal. The champion pancake is pretty large, I only ordered one with a side of two eggs w spinach and cheese w a biscuit. The champion pancake was really good. I thought the ingredients would be on top, good job on it not turning mushy!  The eggs were fine, but the biscuit was crunchy , I expected better due to the restaurant name. Overall, decent experience: the waitress was very helpful and pleasant and I received my food quickly."}
{"text":"Good flavor. I enjoyed my Biscuits and Sausage gravy. Hubby enjoyed his Steak and Eggs. Monday morning so no crowd to fight with. Service was great."}
{"text":"Fav breakfast place, or was. Now I can't eat gluten and enjoy the yummy biscuits and gravy. But I still visit. Staff is nice. Service is quick. Great spot!"}
{"text":"Aptly named, this place offers amazing biscuits and great friendly neighborhood service. We come in often and the staff knows our order and is always friendly and seem to be having a great time. The meals are big and the kids is sometimes big enough for an early breakfast. The oatmeal is huge and amazing. My go o breakfast place!"}
{"text":"First time here, not very busy this AM. Great menu homemade Corned Beef Hash. Yum"}
{"text":"In October of the year we had a nice breakfast.  Should have known it was too good to be true.  Cold food, wrong potatoes, weak, weak coffee.  Won't try again, just can't count on consistency with this place."}
{"text":"Delish! Biscuits and gravy really are the bomb, but the other sides were really good as well. Would definitely come back again. And we came in a Saturday morning and only had to wait a few minutes, and our food came out in less than 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Visited Biscuits around 11am on a Saturday.  Was seated right away and drink order taken promptly.  Ordered biscuits and gravy which came out in about ten minutes.  They were good, for the price, but nothing to write home about.  Service was great though."}
{"text":"The breakfast was amazing. And of course, the biscuits were delicious. Service was perfect, will surely go again! They also support the military and offer military discount."}

First the bad ... don't go there with a group of 6 or more and expect to pay less than about 21.5% tip on the food bill!  They add an automatic 20% tip on the total, INCLUDING TAX!  What a rip-off.  The owner said it's an industry-wide policy.  What a load of dung.

Okay, now for the good.  The service is quite friendly, the servings are huge and pretty good quality.  My two teenage boys couldn't finish their pancakes.  I had biscuits and gravy along with some meat and eggs - quite good.  My wife had a breakfast burrito which she loved.

For a while we were placed in the jet stream of the window air conditioning unit.  We asked to be moved, but they adjusted the A/C.  It was fine, but not what we asked for.  You might be careful where you get seated, we heard others were too hot.

I believe that ANY time you have to pay an automatic tip, it shouldn't exceed 18% on the PRE-tax amount."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for my morning cravings on the weekend. They have the best French toast, it's like eating dessert for breakfast. The Portuguese sausage is really good & the bacon is on point. The staff is always friendly as well."}
{"text":"We are all about family owned dining and were so excited to find this place around the corner from us since we recently moved. I chose small restaurants over iHop or Denny's any day! 

But sometimes small businesses aren't that satisfactory, which is why it can be a gamble sometimes. Anyways, Biscuits is such a unique and country home feeling right as you walk in. Great customer service and delicious food! Our portions were fairly big as well! Can't wait to stop back in! :)"}
{"text":"Your typical diner style food.
I little slow to seat you. 
Servers are fast. 
Kinda has that Mels Diner feel to it.  (Older TV Show)
Food was out fast and pretty tasty. 
Will be back"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us by our hotel front desk and we were blown away! What a fantastic restaurant. Our waitress was Lynn and she was phenomenal. Our kiddos loved the play area. The service, the food and the timing of everything was top notch. We're already talking about returning tomorrow!"}
{"text":"This place pleasantly surprised me I'm always looking forward to trying new breakfast joints. This place serves up a very Traditional Americana Breakfast! Don't look for anything fancy because you will not find it, they don't offer much but what they do offer  is mostly good. For pete sakes order their namesake! Ordering tip, make sure you stick with the meals they have pre-picked on the menu because if you try to alacarte your meal it's going to cost you a small fortune. I like the barn yard feel, especially considering this place use to be a carwash so they did an awesome job on the conversion. The only thing I would suggest is a better grade of coffee, I like a really smooth velvety taste, this one has a more gas station scorched taste. Best bacon and biscuits on this side of town!"}
{"text":"Food is decent. Price is decent. Nothing spectacular that'll blow your socks off. This place is a step up from Denny's. First time being here; thought I'd try something new. Probably won't be back again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the valley for breakfast.  The service is always fast and friendly.  Biscuits and gravy are awesome!  
Chicken fried chicken or chicken fried steak are great as well."}
{"text":"I teetered between 3 and 4 stars, but I've decided to go with 4 because the good things about this place outnumber the things that kind of irked me.  I've been here maybe 3 or 4 times over the course of about 3 years and it has steadily improved.  I would have given this place 1 star a couple years ago.

I will start with the irks, since the list is small.  The service leaves a little to be desired.  I couldn't help but feel rushed by the waiter/bus boy who took my drink order and rushed again by the waitress/hostess/manager who took my food order.  Both of them were walking away from me before I completed my order.  I asked for a cranberry juice and before I could ask for a water also, he was already walking away.  The same went for the waitress who was walking away as I asked for a side of bacon.  I was checked on a few times, but again, it all kind of felt stilted and rushed.

The food has improved vastly, and since I go to places to eat good food, the occasional terse employee won't ruin it for me.  I'd rather have that than a very friendly waitress bring me garbage.

On my most recent visit, I ordered the chicken fried steak with scrambled eggs and the country potatoes with a side of bacon.  The portions were huge and I could not finish it all.  Everything came out hot and fresh.  The steak was very large and delicious, tons of gravy.  The country potatoes, though not very crispy, had a lot of flavor.  The eggs were good too, it felt like easily 3 eggs.  The biscuit is yummy as well.  It's a little dense as other reviewers note, but still very good and buttery.  The side of bacon was huge, I must have gotten like 5 slices.

The prices are VERY reasonable, I have zero complaints there.  I can go in and get stuffed for a very small amount of money.  I regularly get my truck worked on across the street from this place, and based on my last experience, I'll be making this my main go to place when waiting."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today. It seemed a bit pricey for pancakes. 2 pancakes for 9 bucks. I had Denver omelet, country potatoes, and biscuit and gravy. Everything was outstanding. I can't remember a better breakfast in a long time. The acoustics in this place make the restaurant very very loud which is why I'm only giving it 4 along with the over priced but fantastic pancakes. If it was only based on taste, it's 5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"Not your same old breakfast place. Biscuits were awesome, eggs fluffy, potatoes well seasoned. Huevos Rancheros had just the right kick. Count me in."}
{"text":"Service was good but not my kind food! I should have known from the name Biscuits....booths are huge! I needed an adult booster seat. No veggie omelet on the menu or you have to make your own. So if you're the veggie loving omelet type expect to pay 15 bucks for an omelet. I ordered spinach and mushrooms in my omelet and just got a bunch of cheese. Plus coffee was cold! No hot coffee here!"}
{"text":"Man I feel bad, the last few reviews lost a star because of the serrvice and not the food. 

This place is great (food wise)! They definitely know how to make a biscuit. Their country potatoes are super yummy, the chickenfried steak was cooked perfectly, and their prices seem reasonable. Just please dear God refill my drink and all of the drinks of the tables surrounding me. 

My wife had the pancakes. And at first they look dry, but even without butter or syrup,  one bite will correct the misjudgment.  

If you like a traditional American breakfast, you have to give this a try."}
{"text":"Food was very good, the biscuits are excellent turkey sausage was very good the bacon was good I had to take a biscuit home"}
{"text":"With a name like \"Biscuits\" they better be good, right?? Well, thankfully I'm here to say they are. I boldly claimed them to be the best biscuits and gravy I've ever eaten, and I'll happily stand by that. The biscuits were the perfect mix of flavor, texture, and density. The gravy was plentiful, meaty, and rich. It's obvious this is a classic home-cookin' recipe that has been nicely mass produced for a restaurant sized crowd. There are two Biscuits locations (other in Ahwatukee) and I'm happy to see this Family Owned & Operated business flourishing.

I ordered the Biscuits Special - over med eggs/turkey sausage/hash browns/B&G. As stated above, the B&G's were on point. The rest was also done very well, and perfectly accompanied the star of the show. Although I love B&G's, I just couldn't be satisfied with just a big-ol-plate of them. I was happy to see this menu option as it was right up my alley. I will definitely be back, and I'd like to try their Lunch menu. There were multiple items that looked amazing."}
{"text":"We love a good breakfast so we're glad we decided to try this place. The biscuits and gravy were delish!  My pancake was as big as my plate and very tasty. I love that this restaurant is family owned and operated. They also give vets and active military a discount - bonus!"}
{"text":"We eat here a lot! The service is quick and the food is like homemade! They put a lot of food on your plate! Very friendly place! Just wished they stayed opened for supper! They close at 2p daily."}
{"text":"I can see Biscuits becoming a mid-day go-to for late breakfast and lunch.  I've stopped in a few times, also gotten takeout, and I can see why it's starting to build a following.  Solid+ down home food, A+ service

I'll mention this right up early . . . their Portuguese sausage is excellent, and cooked just the way I like it.  Sliced and crisped all over.  Yeah, I wiped a few napkins full of grease off them, but they were a great side.  DEFINITELY will be back for those.  Seriously, who else is doing Portuguese sausage in AZ?

Next, their meatloaf with mushroom red wine gravy is great.  Strange to me, it comes with mashed covered in white gravy?  Huh?  The next time I order the meatloaf, and I certainly will again, the white gravy is getting 86'd.  

Three times I've had the Denver omelet, and it's always been solid.  Not great, kinda skimpy on the green peppers and ham, but well made.

The hash browns are standard, which makes their corned beef hash a bit of a disappointment.  I'm by no means an expert on corned beef hash, but I wanted crispy hash browns mixed with corned beef, and both came out kinda soggy.

Their biscuits . . . I believe they mix in some grits . . . are definitely gut bombs.  Perfect for a hungover morning.

If you're eating in, and order pop, they bring you your pop in a big glass and leave an extra carafe of it at the table.  Nice.  Wasteful sometimes, but nice.

Overall, Biscuits is a great addition to the Ahwatukee neighborhood"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!! I got the biscuits and gravy and its was such a large portion and it was quality. Service was fast and friendly, I got the full order of biscuits and gravy with an extra side of gravy a drink and an order of hash browns. The total for all of that was $12.63. If I lived here I would be coming here every morning. Kind of a shame they close early."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Ahwatukee, difficult to find a seat at times...awesome biscuits n gravy, huevos rancheros and mickey mouse pancakes for the kids."}
{"text":"We just moved from Cali and really like this joint. The grits are so creamy, the biscuits are perfection and the chicken fried steak and chicken fried chicken are both delicious!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken fried steak and it was delicious. Their signature biscuits are really good. Great job living up to your namesake. I will def be back."}
{"text":"Great stick-to-your ribs kind of cooking. The grits are out of this world and the pancakes are awesome!!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing!! I had the champion pancakes and the coffee was great. I love a good cup of black coffee. I would have given 5 stars. But it was warm inside. Would go agin. Wish they had outside seating"}
{"text":"Love love love the food....ordered my omelet the way I want it...the best....nice atmosphere fast  service ...just delicious......."}
{"text":"Food is average but the service was horrible.  There was no wait but no one came to take our drink order.  We finally flagged someone down to take our order.  We should have left but we decided to stay.  Our food came out fast but we had not received our drinks.  We ended up waiting another 10 minutes before we could flag someone down to bring our drinks.  I would not recommend this place and won't be back."}
{"text":"Yes, the biscuits are delicious enough to represent the name of the restaurant, but the overall experience won't bring me back.

Service is pretty bad. It took awhile to get seated on a slow Wednesday morning. Our waiter sat a carafe of coffee on the table so refills weren't an issue. It took longer than it should have for our food to come out considering just two other tables were occupied. When I got my champion pancakes (blueberry and almond whole wheat pancakes), I cut into them and came up with a knife full of raw batter. We had trouble flagging down a server to send them back. When he finally did come to the table, he had the nerve to tell me they weren't raw, it was just the juice from the berries. Bzzt! Wrong answer! I was irritated to begin with, now I was steaming. He reluctantly took the pancakes back to the kitchen. The correctly cooked pancakes were good, but they weren't worth the wait.

My husband is satisfied with their biscuits and gravy dish, probably enough to come back on his own."}
{"text":"Biscuit was a great find on yelp! Very wide breakfast choices with generous portions. You will not leave hungry. The service was excellent...my coffee mug was never empty!"}
{"text":"Our server John was very nice. I got a discount on my meal for being a veteran. The food was very good. They had big portions. The biscuits and gravy were outstanding. John also told us they do a fish fry every Friday."}
{"text":"Just what we were looking for - breakfast! I had a great egg, cheese and bacon on a biscuit sandwich and the boy had a breakfast sandwich. Tasty food, friendly service and close to home, I'm sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"Was looking around on Yelp for a good breakfast place. And this popped up, and it's nearby my house. So I decided to give it a shot. Boy am I glad. @-@ I had the biscuit special. The biscuit was light and fluffy, even the bacon was cooked properly!!! THE BACON!!!! That was the icing on the cake for this place. If you want to try something new for breakfast, and to exceed your expectations, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"As the name suggests they have great biscuits and great breakfasts I had the omelet and my wife had the eggs Benedict they were great, only compliant
 is its a bit oily"}
{"text":"This is by far my family's favorite breakfast restaurant!  Their biscuits with butter and honey, and their pancakes are both amazing!  My wife loves their biscuits and gravy breakfast, and I usually get the chicken fried chicken breakfast. I imagine that just about anything we order would be excellent - and the portions are so big you could share!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna call it....ok. It is no TC Eggington's! We got the Eggs Benedict and the South Mountain Scramble. They were...ok. My eggs Benedict looked and tasted like they use sliced box lunch meat ham on it. It was weird. They hollandaise was good, but...meh. Cute place. Nice people, just average food. I'll go a few exits more and eat at Eggington's. Way better."}
{"text":"Probably the worst breakfast we've ever had. My husband's southern potatoes were oily as if they were made at an earlier time and refried. Probably why the food came out in 5 mins and was like warm. My food tasted like a pile of butter. No good flavors. Coffee was watered down. We didn't even bother to complain and just ate as much as we could, paid and left. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"There's two ways to look at this place. One is getting quality food at a good price. The other is getting a lot of food for a cheap price. I prefer the former but those who prefer the latter won't agree with my review.

I thought the scramble I had was okay but nothing fantastic. I definitely didn't care for the biscuits. The food wasn't health conscious at all but if you're looking to fill up with calories and get a good-sized portion then this is your type of place. Also, I am not a fan of the diner-type ambiance... I would rather have something with more character but I'm glad I tried this place out."}
{"text":"Service was good. We had to wait over 10 mins even though there were hardly any people there. The food was cold and bland. The 2 stars are for the helpful server. Highly doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. I grew up in Virginia and occasionally crave down-home southern food. I love the homey menu. We eat so often they know us by drink order. :) They are always friendly and even when busy we get seated right away. Their pick-up is so quick I can't believe how fast it is. I order by phone and it is ready 20 minutes later. I wish they had delivery. The Friday night fish fry is wonderful. My family are big seafood eaters. My youngest son is autistic and a picky eater. He ate an entire bowl of the clam chowder. Other than their biscuits and gravy I love the BBQ sandwich."}
{"text":"for some good ol fashion breakfast grub....go here now. Chill hard eating the \"everything on the menu\". Seriously haven't had bad food here. The people that work here are money in the bank. what are you still doing reading this? GET TO THA CHOPPA and fly to Biscuits NOW!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place because it looked so ma and pa.. you sit yourself by the way.

I RARELY eat fish and chips and I felt adventurous today, so I went ahead and ordered- whoo. Besides, the rest of the menu was breakfast items and I wanted to get something different!

The Crispy, hot, flat pieces of fried fish over a bed of fries and cool bowl of coleslaw made my day. It was comfort food that hit the spot. The server especially caught my attention because she was on top of everything and made seafood recommendations to me as I went up to pay. She didn't seem like a waitress that hated her job.

They close at 7pm on the weekend- what's that all about? :("}
{"text":"Sadly, and  they are over priced and less than mediocre food. The owner makes, in my opinion,racist pig like remarks...ranting and raving about politics which of course, is not the smartest thing to do when you are in business."}
{"text":"This place was good. I ordered the champion pancakes which had oats, almonds, and blueberries in them. My fiancé ordered a biscuit meal and he said the biscuit was just okay. You would think with a name like biscuit that it would be great. The layout of the restaurant is a little weird and the booth is a little far from the table. Other than that its an okay place to visit. We opted to skip Postino and try this place but I think I would go to Postino over this place any day."}
{"text":"There is NOTHING special about this place ! Biscuits were dry, and seemed like store bought. Sausage gravy was VERY cheap, with day old sausage patties chopped up in it. HERE'S A TIP..... Use ground breakfast sausage and the drippings, and more pepper to give it more flavor. And PLEASE..... Don't order the hash browns. They appeared to be pre-cooked, and were so hard you could not eat them. The grits were watery and COLD, the butter would not even melt. The only thing really edible, was the bacon and eggs. There are a dime a dozen breakfast places in Gilbert, so take my advice...... AVOID THIS DIRTY OLD DINER."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast spot! The long waits are definitely and indication of how delicious this place is. Normally there is roughly a 30 minute wait on the weekend for breafast, but it is 100% worth it. The biscuits are literally heavenly, fluffy moist and perfectly cooked. The pancakes are my second favorite and probably the best pancakes I have ever had. Each time we go, we split one blueberry pancake at the table and it is more than enough for all of us to share. Out of all the visits that we have had, there has only been once that there was a problem, the water we got tasted terrible. Understandably it is tap water, but we are not sure what was going on that day. Politely we all ordered juice but did not think necessary to complain. The only thing that could make this better is if they served alcohol."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.. The inside in adorable! The menu stated they use local and organic ingredients so that's obviously a plus for me. But to start out, it took about 5 minutes for the hostess to even acknowledge us and get us seated. The waitress was basically running the place by herself. It happens, but she didn't check on us once. I definitely felt bad for her. I got the pancakes and they were quite chewy instead of light and fluffy. My boyfriend got eggs, bacon, and country potatoes. The country potatoes were awesome! The scrambled eggs left a lot to be desired. They just looked weird, and runny, and my boyfriend confirmed their \"weirdness.\" This place is within walking distance from my house so I might give it another whirl for a lunchtime entree."}
{"text":"Were were waiting for Biscuits to open near Sam's Club.  It was well worth the wait.  The food was delicious, the server was the BEST, and we left there vowing to return soon."}
{"text":"Sat for 10 minutes without even being greeted by anyone...so left and went down the road to the much much better Biscuits Café (totally different)"}
{"text":"My daughter and I had  a long overdue mother/daughter lunch date last week, and wanted to try something new rather than the usual places we go to. I'd been wanting to try this Biscuits location for a while now, since they are 5 minutes from my house and I pass by at least once a week. I also had seen a piece written up about this new location in the local paper, and the owner said they pride themselves on good ol' fashin home cookin'! So, off to Biscuits in Gilbert we went...
We were greeted and seated promptly, arriving around 11:45. Not many folks eating at that time. The restaurant was very clean, including the ladies room. We thought it was kind of funny that in the ladies restroom there is a pretty tray on the counter next to the sink, and on the tray is a can of Aquanet hairspray. Nothing else on the tray, just the can of hairspray. Maybe to give your 'do a little spritz after washing your hands? 

Our server brought us both hot tea, and because the menu is plentiful, we had a hard time choosing what to order. Our server checked back 2 or 3 times, and we ordered a fruit plate to share, a wedge salad to share, an open faced breakfast dish with biscuits and eggs/cheese/ham/gravy, and the Smoked Chicken Jalapeno pasta. 

All of the food was fantastic! We expected to get a small fruit plate with cottage cheese, but it was a platter mounded with fruit, all of it fresh and delicious! Honeydew, cantaloupe, raspberries (yes, raspberries! and not frozen!), blueberries, strawberries, bananas and I think I remember some fresh pineapple chunks as well~ enough fruit for 4 people easily. The wedge salad was not one huge wedge of lettuce, but two wedges! Lots of bacon, scallions, tomatoes and great homemade bleu cheese dressing. The biscuit breakfast dish (South Mountain Scramble) was delicious, and the pasta was so different and yummy! We had lots of leftovers, which we didn't expect, but my college ages daughter gladly took home~

The hot tea pots could be a bit larger, either that or they need to fill the teapots up completely, even if a little water spills out of the spout. The teapot comes on a plate with a napkin underneath and lemon slice, so the water would end up on the plate anyway if it did overflow a little. The service is really great and friendly. The server and busser tended to hover just a tiny bit too much, but nothing that would make me leave a 4 star review. We'll hopefully going back again tomorrow for my Mother's Day meal!  

After tip our bill was $48, and although there were only two of eating, we were given enough food for 4 people. Less than $25 per person including tip, and 2 whole meals leftover to take home. That's my definition of a good value. Can't wait to take my hubby there for breakfast for the SOS, and the large breakfast patty sausages!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place, anything you order is yummy, And the staff are fantastic!!! Check this place out you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"My kingdom for a biscuit!  Wow. Having a late breakfast with some friends in Phoenix and my trusty amigo recommended Biscuits. I wasn't expecting too much, especially when we had to wait to be seated and the rr was only 1/2 full. But I was encouraged to wait for it and much to the delight of my tastebuds I did. We sampled: Biscuits Special,  House omelet and Chicken Fried Steak w/ grits. 
The biscuits and gravy were delicious,  no trace of grease or fats...though I'm certain they were in there. Once you've had the fried steak it will be difficult to want to try anything else on the menu, but let me just say everything we had was satisfying delicious somehow felt like a \"healthy\" meal.

A Bite more: 
Best time mid lunch
Good place for kids
Coffee, while not bad, is ....ordinary
Great place to bring friends"}
{"text":"One of our fav breakfast places! Nothing on the menu will disappoint!!!!!
Great place for when you want a classic breakfast done perfectly. Staff is always friendly, restaurant always clean. Even when super busy it is never super loud which is nice in the morning. 
It is the type of place though that you will not need lunch if you eat breakfast. The portions are huge!

Some of our favorites are the SOS and the Biscuits and Gravy. I always get the grits instead of potatoes."}
{"text":"Kinda of a weird start here the older male host was a little awkward and didn't speak to us while he sat us. However as we got to a table our server was wonderful very friendly polite and fast she made the experience here great. The biscuits plate was full of flavor and very large you won't leave hungry. The only negative I'll give this place is the coffee is weak but nothing to stop us from coming back again! Highly recommend this place hopefully you get miss Pam!"}
{"text":"Kind of getting to be my go-place for breakfast when I want to eat out solo.  (Solo, because when my wife and I go out, she likes to go to someplace more exotic).  I like this place because you can get good comfort breakfast food, like omelets, grits, their great biscuits (of course), at a reasonable price and not have to wait real long (like an hour in downtown Gilbert at some of the swanky restaurants).

Service is pretty quick and the staff friendly and folksy.  The decor is a bit folksy, too.  It looks a little dated but it is familiar.  The menu is diverse enough but not overwhelming--if I know what I'm in the mood for, I can have my order ready before my server comes back.  It doesn't take too long to get food.  However, mid-morning or after 1pm is probably best to beat the crowds.  There's a benefit to not being trendy--no long waits.

I even tried something different that I found I liked.  Being from the East Coast, I'm not familiar with biscuits and gravy.  I finally tried the sausage gravy on biscuits here.....mmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever!!!! It was our first time coming in and we will be back for sure... if you are looking for friendly service with awesome food this is the place for you!!! Left with a smile on my face and a full belly"}
{"text":"Biscuits is a great spot for families and has a more traditional breakfast menu. If you're looking for a place to \"brunch,\" look elsewhere. But if you're looking for a laid back environment with good food, give Biscuits a try! Be warned, our waiter seemed overwhelmed and would disappear for long periods at a time. I'd recommend ordering by the time they bring you your drinks and asking for the check when they bring you your food. 

The restaurant was very large inside and we were seated immediately when we arrived on a Saturday late morning. The waiter came fairly quickly to get our drink order, but after he dropped off the drinks, he didn't come back for our order for nearly 20 minutes. Although the menu is big, it didn't take us that long to figure out what we wanted. Thankfully the food didn't take too long to come out given our wait up to that point. The standout was the chicken fried steak. 

Our waiter again disappeared on us, so we waited awhile after we finished eating to finally get our check. Luckily you pay at the counter which allowed us a quicker check-out than he would have provided. 

Food probably deserves 4 stars, but our speed of service was a 2. I will say, even though he disappeared a lot, when we did interact with our waiter, he was a nice guy."}
{"text":"I tried this place on an early Sunday morning during Thanksgiving weekend. I was with my fiancé and his family. We didn't have to wait long. We got there at about 9:30 AM and it was just then getting packed. We waited for about 10 minutes. We were seated at a booth, which was pretty small. We had to add a seat on the end. Looks like all the booths were pretty small, I don't know if you had more than five people how you would all fit. The service was pretty good. The coffee was not very good at all. Even for a diner status it really wasn't great. I wish I would've skipped that altogether. The breakfast, however was really good. I always get the traditional breakfast. I highly recommend the turkey sausage. I usually don't order that but for some reason I was inclined to here. It was a good choice, if you like spicy food. Every meal comes with a biscuit and the biscuits are really incredible. Hence the name. I will give them that. They give you very big portions, Especially if you get the pancakes. It fits the entire plate. You usually will walk out with a box full of the food that you did not eat. Overall, I would go here for the food. Maybe get a coffee before, however you were not allowed to bring any outside food or beverage inside."}
{"text":"Hearty portions and quick service but the food left some to desire. The hashbrowns were extra crispy and you would've thought the middle layer was left out. Then when my friend and I went to pay, the lady was super confused on how to ring up our bill separately and it took us forever to pay & get outta there."}
{"text":"I've only been to Biscuits twice.  The food is pretty good. Honestly better than my normal breakfast food place. So for that I have to give four stars.

I over heard a manager on the phone complaining to someone about their hours or something. When we stood up to pay at the desk the same lady ignored us and helped check in two incoming customers without asking us to wait.  I was not very pleased by this so I have to take away a star for that."}
{"text":"Always great fish fry and fries, and excellent service. They handle big-ish parties well. Great atmosphere for a low-key lunch with coworker's if you don't need anything fancy!! My coworkers seem obsessed with the chicken fingers so I'd recommend that. ;)"}
{"text":"Try this breakfast joint last week and I really enjoyed it. Our waitress was very attentive and she took care of us with great service. Since this restaurant supposed to have the best biscuits & gravy I ordered my breakfast with eggs, biscuits & gravy, sausages and hash brown. The gravy is really tasty! I want more gravy! I want to eat everything with that gravy on top. The portion was pretty big. Hubby and I had enough left over for lunch. 

Coffee is not like diner coffee, stronger and better to my taste. Come try it guys."}
{"text":"I haven't heard much about Biscuits good or bad I just know they moved into the space that use to be \"Chuy's in Ahwatukee\" The entrance is on the side of the building.

We were greeted by the hostess promptly and sat within a few minutes of arrival. We sat in on what use to be the porch side of Chuy's and it felt a little like the lending tower of Pisa. Their menu has plenty to pick from; Biscuits, Pancakes, French toast, Eggs, Omelets, Burritos, the usual breakfast fare. 

Biscuits come with practically everything and they were small but fairly good. I had pancakes and they were huge but tasteless. Maybe a topping would have helped. Topping is extra and for $6 for 3 pancakes and $2 for topping that seemed a bit much for a meatless meal. My spouse had an omelet with spinach, bacon and onions and that also got to be a bit pricey with all the add ons. We also got a side of turkey sausage...maybe we should have just passed on this one. Home fries are very tasty with peppers and onions. Our friend had the biscuits and gravy and said they were fairly good. But not close to the southern style they were hoping for. The coffee was good. The iced tea was fresh brew. They sit carafes of your beverages on the table as to not have you wait for refills or so the waitress doesn't have to ever come back. The service was slow at first and then non-existent. We had to practically trip the waitress to get our check. 

Biscuit's is not a chain restaurant. (A good thing). It was clean and the front enclosed patio area is very bright, cheery and a slight lean to the right. The restrooms where clean but ONE stall so \"do what you got a do and get out!\" The business is new and I'm sure they will work out the kinks. They are now serving Dinner, Friday-Sunday. Perhaps I will venture in for dinner in the future."}
{"text":"I used to come to this location once a month for the past 2 years and recommended to many friends and family. The last 2 visits have been less than desirable! Not only do they waste water by serving every table huge ice waters with lemon (even if you don't want it) they also just significantly cut back their portions. Maybe they could have saved money on all the wasted water, ice and lemons to keep the portions the same. The chicken fried chicken used to fill over half the plate. The last time I ordered it, it was lucky to fill 1/3 of the plate and barely gave any white gravy.  Thinking I'd give this place one last chance to redeem themselves I drove all the way in from San Tan Valley only to be turned away with a young girl meeting me at the door to say their credit card machine was down. I offered to pay cash and she said 'Sorry No.' WHAT?! Turn away a cash customer? CRAZY! THIS WAS MY LAST VISIT!"}
{"text":"I had the biscuits and gravy and I must say, they are pre-packaged/pre-made.  Over all I would say its ok but definitely not something I would go out of my way for."}
{"text":"Great food. I had the french toast chiquita style (bananna & nutella), it was delicious! The bf had biscuits and gravy and they were delicious too. We've seen this place and never stopped, glad we finally did. It was delicious."}
{"text":"Great service and mediocre breakfast food.  I haven't found a decent breakfast place in this neck of the woods in years, I can't fault a place for being right on par with everyone else.  They are much much Better than Deny's or IHOP or village inn but typical for any other breakfast place you can think of.  They do have lunch options...give them a try I guess"}
{"text":"The food was quick and the service was good. My only issue was that the place smelled a little like plastic. 

Their biscuits were BOMB!"}
{"text":"excellent breakfasts - Portuguese sausage yummy.  super warm staff."}
{"text":"I wish I could eat here more often the food is really good and my family really loves it as well"}
{"text":"Been Jonesing for biscuits and gravy so I stopped by Biscuits today. I arrived at 9:15 on a Wednesday and there were a few full tables. They were playing 70's soft rock from SiriusXM over the speakers. 

I was greeted right away and offered drinks. I ordered iced tea, One Biscuit and gravy plus a side of Corned Beef Hash. 

My breakfast arrived in six minutes. The hash was about 40% beef, 50% potatoes and 10% onions. A very good ratio. Just the right caramelization too. 

The biscuit was a fluffy, 1\" high pillow with no 'flour taste', which means it was perfectly made. Plenty of thick, creamy white gravy and big chunks of chopped sausage. I wanted to lick the dish. 

I could not improve either dish. 

Definitely a return visit in my future."}
{"text":"First time at this Biscuits. Arrived at 9 on a Wednesday morning and there were 10 tables full. Good sign. 

I was greeted immediately and offered menu and drink. I ordered two biscuits with gravy. 

The biscuits were fluffy, buttery and smothered with fully cooked, creamy gravy, which had plenty of large sausage pieces. I wouldn't change anything for this dish. It was so good, I came back the next day and ordered the same thing. 

It came to $6.48 plus tip, which was a ridiculous price. It could've been double that and I would've paid happily. 

They play mellow 60's rock, like Simon and Garfunkle over the speakers. 

Denny's went international but Biscuits stayed country-comfortable, and I think it was smart. I felt I was back home in Mom's kitchen. 

Most places offer toast with a meal but here, they offer toast or a biscuit. Brilliant!

My new home for biscuits and gravy!"}
{"text":"Loved the food, great service (everyone was really sweet) but it was hard to hear the people at my table. The acoustics are really bad in this place and the kitchen noises traveled out to diner area. But I'll go back for the good food"}
{"text":"I come here all the time when I want home style cooking but I dont want to cook. The grits are freaking amazing. The portions are large, meals are moderately priced and the customer service makes you feel welcome. A taste of home is what I call this place..stop by but make sure to get grits and say hi to Laura.. Food porn."}
{"text":"Every time I have been here I have had a good experience.. Good good breakfast. It's not my absolute favorite. The service is nice the food is larger portion. The biscuits are regular size which is surprising since your going to a place called Biscuits. But yet nope. I still go back because it's good but so far I give 3 stars."}
{"text":"Still one of the best breakfast lunch establishments in the area. Excellent home made meals the best grits not in the South and great service. Discount for veterans is a welcomed treat. Owner is ex military. All items I have had over the years have been always fresh and tasty. Don't miss a chance to try the location when in the area."}
{"text":"The girls met up with the boys after they rode bikes this morning and we had a great breakfast. There were only a handful of other people there so our food came out within a few minutes and it was all very good. We had a nice variety of food inlcuding eggs benedict, home fries, bacon, grits and Portuguese sausage. Everything tasted fresh and was prepared to order. 

Our waitress was very nice but didn't hover. I love it that she brought a carafe of extra soda to allow us to refill our own sodas when we needed more.  

It's right around the corner, so I am sure we will be back soon."}
{"text":"The place was fairly busy but there was a couple seats open. It took forever to get our order taken however. We rarely saw anyone to get refills on drinks. Our waitress gave us the wrong bill initially. The only reason it gets three stars instead of two is the food was good. I got the breakfast sandwich and a cinnamon roll. The roll was a little dry. Probably wouldn't come back if I did live in town."}
{"text":"Champion pancakes are so hearty, biscuits are fluffy, love love love!!!"}
{"text":"This place is in desperate need of a deep cleaning.. Food was decent but I was too grossed out by the conditions of the restaurant!  I'm thinking if the dining area looks this bad, then what does the kitchen look like  Please please have this establishment scrubbed down and freshened up!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was amazing, everyone was helpful. The food portions were perfect so bring a good appetite, even the kids meals are good sizes."}
{"text":"Food is good nothing to rave about but plentiful and just dont be in a hurry.

Hours are bad. I bought the Groupon thing and cant use it because they close so darn early. 

The lady told me \"Oh well we are open late on Friday nights!\" (ya 7pm is not late here in the Tuke lady.)

I agree with the first review, it would be nice to have the entrance in the front, guess they didn't want to pay for that remodel.

Ultimately, I miss Chueys."}
{"text":"Biscuits never disappoints.  Friendly staff.  So happy they are able to keep this going."}
{"text":"Best place to get breakfast in Tempe. Get the traditional breakfast with the country potatoes, they are to die for. The coffee is excellent at this joint. The bacon is extra thick and cooked to perfection. Very nice service and when you order coffee they give you a whole thermos of it so you don't have to wait for refills."}
{"text":"I have eaten here at least 6 times so far and have never had a bad experience. Food is good, staff is friendly and the biscuits alone are well worth the visit. I usually end up getting the chicken fried chicken with two eggs over hard and a bowl  of grits. Reminds me of good ol' southern  breakfast."}
{"text":"Came here with my dad while he was in town and loved it. Food was GREAT!!! While waiting for our food, we watched the employees work. The were such am amazing team. Nothing I had ever seen before. Everyone helped everyone else bring food to tables and clean off tables for next guest. Will totally hit this place up again!"}
{"text":"I had the biscuits special without meat and the scrambled eggs were cooked very well , the hashbrowns had a great flavor, and the biscuits and gravy were fantastic (although I wish they would've had sausage and gravy but that's a personal preference). My wife had the champion pancakes, just a note, if you're going to get these make sure you have someone to share with the portion is huge! There were quite a few almonds next into the mix which is a great touch but I feel the nuts could have been more evenly dispersed throughout the pancake rather then off clumped in the middle. There were also blueberries in the pancakes that had  excellent flavor. The waitress checked back with us several times, however it was almost to the point where we felt as if we were being rushed out. We did not overstay are welcome by any means as I ate my pretty quick. There was no line of people waiting. Overall our experience was pretty good, I probably would not take out-of-town visitors here but my wife and I may return sometime in the future."}
{"text":"I checked out this place with a Groupon deal, and boy am I glad that I didn't pay full price! For a place called Biscuits you'd think that their biscuits would be superb, right? Sorry, that's not the case here. Their biscuits tasted like they were baked several days ago and were microwaved. They were dry and hard on the bottom.

I ordered a hotdog, which was on a bun that I think I've purchased at the grocery store... y'know, the kind you get in an 8-ct package for $0.99. The fries tasted like they were frozen. 

My friend ordered the southern style chicken strips. He figured they'd be really good since they were $9 and were listed as a house specialty. Sorry, but it seems like these were frozen, too, and the fries were the same ones I got.

To top off the whole experience, the waitress was snippy and didn't want to take our Groupons. They said one per person and she was convinced that they should be one per table. 

TL/DR version:
Overpriced food for what I can get at Walmart and fry at home or pick up for half the cost at McDonald's."}
{"text":"The service was good but the food was well below average. My fish and chips were way too salty and my moms pasta looked like it was bought pre packed and served from the microwave. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast diner. We eat here most Saturdays. Red potatoes are amazing. Omelets are delicious.  Biscuits are outstanding (duh) and come with housemade jam too. Staff is always curteous and friendly."}
{"text":"Visiting from Las Vegas and found Biscuits on Yelp. We enjoyed the food. Very good. Nice sized portions. The whole wheat pancakes we're very good. I'd go there again if I'm every in Phoenix. Only three stars because the table we sat at was dirty. The seats were slanted, my purse fell and behind the seat was food and dust filth, the silverware I had, had food stains, a plant hanging right above the seat wasn't safe, the window had a thick layer of dust, the salt and pepper shaker were sticky... Aside from all that, the food was great. Next time I'll ask for a table away from the window."}
{"text":"What is there to say, I'm a bit overtaken by the tin barn motif.  Wasn't truly wanting that, but hey, driving home from church, let's take a taste.

We were sat down relatively promptly.  Water was served without asking and at this time I didn't need any coffee.  

I ordered the traditional breakfast over-medium but ended up with over-easy eggs which is ok.  Or is that over-medium for Biscuits?  My girlfriend ordered a sausage egg and biscuit and to my protest she also ordered a pancake.

The nice waitress brought our plates out and had mentioned that if I did not enjoy the Portuguese sausage she would promptly replace it with another meat as it was different.  Well I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it and reminded me a bit of Spanish-style Chorizo.  The biscuit sandwich was at least double the size of any McBiscuit.  The only thing that could change the fare would have been fresh made jam.

A nice little find in Gilbert I do say."}
{"text":"Food was lukewarm, pancake burned, eggs undercooked, service forgetful. We won't return. There are plenty of better options for breakfast nearby."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast place. When it gets busy, it is busy. Ordered the Biscuits Special. The biscuits were soft & fluffy; such a surprise since I've had biscuits at other places that were very dense & hard. Sausage gravy was peppery & yummy-crumbled sausage would probably be better than chucks of sausage links. Country potatoes was good but it seems like the portion I got had more onions than potatoes. Service was great, be patient when it gets busy."}
{"text":"Says closed at 2:00pm and no sign was outside saying closed until I literally walked up to the door and then closed magically. You crackers are a**"}
{"text":"Well first off the food is mediocre. The owner is an ass hole. We were trying to enjoy Mother's Day and he instructed his wait staff to clean our table with us sitting there. Thanks for ruining my Mother's Day. Do not visit this location, their other location on Elliot and 48th has MUCH better manners. But remember, the food is mediocre!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming to this biscuits for more than 2 years now since I moved out here! This particular biscuits have never failed us!! The omelettes are always delicious and you can really tell that they are from fresh local eggs!! The orange juice is also freshly squeezed! (Update as of 4/1/16 the orange juice is from a container lol we saw it before we checked out lol) but it's still good,  My husband always raves about the premium thick cut smokey bacon yum!! We make an effort to drive to this location from chandler because we believe it's the best! Service is always fantastic with the older pretty ladies there! Seats are comfortable and space is always cleaned! Did I tell you about the biscuits yet??? Omg super delicious with their fluffy butter and huge portions! Please give them a try they will be totally worth it, don't mind all the older people there (you know it's good when u see a lot of old old people there) you can't mess with their food (^_^) !!!"}
{"text":"Really good neighborhood cafe for breakfast and brunches :)  I have been here like 4 times and each time, they had great service and good food.  In terms of creativity of the menu, this place beats Cracker Barrel but does not have as adventurous a menu as Crackers and Co Cafe, down the road.  

The ambience is kind of like a comfortable neighbourhood eatery where u go to for dinner if you are too tired to cook.  Comfortable seats, lots of natural light thru their diner looking windows and a staff that will probably get to know your name after a few times.

Food wise, like what the other reviewers said, they make a mean biscuit.  I know, not everybody is a big fan of it, so get their pancakes instead.  They do put in some biscuit batter in it to give it a very different feeling.  But dun just go there for biscuits haha, other stuff like egg and sausage, are very standard breakfast stuff.  Do check out the portugese sausage instead of the regular ones, a lot more flavorful and a little spicy.  I also had lunch here before, they have a smoked chicken jalapeno alfredo.  I like it very much, its got a lot of chicken and quite a bit of cheese over it.  True the jalapeno does not make it spicy enough for my liking, but its fusion italian so I guess the jalapeno is to enhance its flavor and not dominate it.  Also jalapeno in az is not spicy, if you want spicy pasta, maybe ask them to add a pinch of habanero to the sauce to spice it up.  Its by far one of the best fusion pasta I have had before.  I know its not those fancy fusion food where u get two bites worth of food and U are still hungry and end up with a big check.  This is a pretty decent size plate which will keep you full and happy.

I hear they have an excellent fish fry too on Friday, but like others who reviewed it, they seem to close a little earlier.  But its fine, just go earlier if you really mean to eat there ! :)  or else just do brunch there on a lazy weekend, you will likely be satisfied.  Else let the owners know, they are usually at the counter or going around refilling coffee and asking if you enjoyed your meal and such."}
{"text":"And you thought Windy City was gone...

The food is horrible, takes FOREVER to get, and lacks flavor. 

I ordered my food last Tuesday, I am still waiting.

I will say this, the service has gone downhill. At least the staff in the previous establishment filled up my cup and asked how I was doing. Save yourself some money and eat some dog food."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food here.  Biscuits were soooo good!  Had the chicken fried steak, was not disappointed if I lived in this area I would definitely be a regular.  Would definitely split my breakfast with my husband next time as the portions are huge!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, quaint place. The eggs Benedict was superb. Can't wait to return to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Met some of the family at Biscuits, a nice locally owned place in the middle of Ahwatukee!

Great Grits, super creamy especially with that butter I added!  Super flaky fluffy biscuit, really fresh didn't even need honey just Mo Buttah!

Finally - SPAM and Eggs!  Oh yes!  Companions had chorizo breakfast burrito and a huge juicy pork chop plate. They weren't talkin so it must have been GOOD!  Three Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"5 of us came for breakfast short wait at 9 a.m. we all had something different and all meals were very good outstanding waitress will be going back soon"}
{"text":"Flaky real fish (cod). 3 pieces $10.00 every day. Friday 2-5 buy 1 get 2nd one at 50 %off . Coleslaw soso. I will be back. They know a lot of people by name when they come through the door."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Champion pancakes are great. Biscuits like mom made. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"The food is great - homestyle cooking. The service is always fast, but the waitresses seems less to care about a customer and more about getting on with their stuff work stuff. Luckily, I love their breakfast, I often return. Haha."}
{"text":"Took my boyfriends mom to brunch here while visiting from out of town and it was so good!! She got the biscuits and gravy and I got the eggs benedict. The portions were so big I couldn't even finish half of my plate, and I can EAT! I will definitely be coming back here next time I'm out in Arizona"}
{"text":"The hubby and I decided to have an early morning breakfast, we arrived around 7:45 am. It took us some time to order...we didn't feel rushed at all. John was courteous, funny, and very informative. He made us laugh a few times and made us feel very welcomed. Our food was prepared rather quickly and was nice and hot when served. They definitely do breakfast correctly. The biscuits are out of this world! One would hope, given the namesake. We've been to Biscuits before and we will continue to choose it over any other breakfast joint. Happy to see that building getting some good business. Prices are reasonable, portions are large, and the atmosphere is comparable to granny's kitchen. :) Highly recommend the chichen fried steak!"}
{"text":"First let me say the food here IS good.  I want to like this place (been here 3 times over the past 6 months) but I don't think I will be back.  First visit I ordered my eggs over easy - the whites were not cooked and so after cutting into them I just didn't eat them.  I had plenty of other food which was delicious so I wasn't even going to mention it.  The waitress asked me if they were OK and I just told her they were undercooked but it wasn't a big deal.  She rudely told me that over easy eggs means they aren't supposed to be cooked all the way.  I said this is true for the yolk but the whites should always be cooked.  She argued her point and just made it awkward.  Second time I ordered to-go.  I take fault for this one because I should have double checked the boxes before leaving the restaurant.  They handed me the bags of food and read off everything I ordered and I just left.  I got home and was missing parts of my order.  Went back and they got it to me - I wasn't upset because I live close but I did think it was weird they didn't apologize for the inconvenience.  I chalked it up to them being super busy.  Went back one more time this morning.  Ordered the biscuits special with grits, sausage, and scrambled eggs.  They brought out biscuits special with over easy eggs, sausage, and hashbrowns.  The waiter came over within a minute or two of the order being brought and asked if everything was correct - I told him the eggs and hashbrowns got mixed up.  He re-read the ticket and said to hold on.  He came back in about 30 seconds with my exact order but it was cold.  I just ate it because even cold their food is great.  If I do ever make it back here I will try a different location.  I think I have just had horrible luck."}
{"text":"Biscuits is OK. I'm not opposed to returning, but I'm in no hurry to do so either. The food is a little better than those national chain breakfast spots...but it's nowhere near phenomenal either. The concept of the restaurant is sound, and it seems like the owner's intentions are good; but the execution isn't fully up to par.

NOTES:
+The biscuits are indeed good. Big, fluffy, hot, & fresh. They're even a tiny bit crispy on the outside. Very tasty...and I don't even usually like biscuits.
+Served with real butter (not margarine). Nice.
=Bacon was decent...crispy, and not super greasy. But it wasn't super thick and meaty (and apple-smoked) like some of the better breakfast spots.
=The chili was ok. But it could have used less cumin in the recipe. There was so much that it almost had a curry taste.
+My eggs were cooked perfectly! A perfect over-medium. That's difficult for a lot of restaurants to get right. Props.
=Hashbrowns were decent. Not very flavorful though...and they aren't really generous with them either. Potatoes aren't THAT expensive, and it looks better when the plates come out full.
-Corned beef hash was awful. Too many green peppers in it. That's all you tasted. Bad recipe. I wonder sometimes if the chef/cook even loves to eat when I taste a recipe that off.
+Generous with the soda. They give you an extra little container with your initial (big) cup of it -- that way you're in no danger of running out. [I personally don't drink that much, so it was wasted on me, but I appreciated the thoughtfulness.]
+Service was good. Friendly. Speedy. They even took the corned beef hash off of my bill because I really didn't like it. Very cool.

Overall, tremendous upside for Biscuits. It definitely has potential. I'll probably be back at some point, but it's not at the top of my list of things to do. Still, I wish them the best. I hope they continue to improve because Ahwatukee could use a solid diner-style breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. This restaurant is not on my side of town otherwise I would be here quite often! But first of all, the biscuits, the biscuits are delicious! Fluffy, light, flaky, buttery, served warm with butter is the perfect recipe.

I went with a traditional breakfast while I was here. Eggs, bacon (extra crispy), and potatoes. The eggs are made to the tee here which is always symbolic to the type of place your at. The potatoes and bacon were also tasty. I devoured my entire breakfast, while eating the warm biscuit first. Everything is reasonably price with quick service! I would love to come back since breakfast is my favorite meal!!"}
{"text":"I've only been in Phoenix for a little over a year. But this place is best breakfast I've had here. I got the huevos rancheros and my wife had the biscuit special. Both were great. We went on Sunday morning during the rush and the wait was only 10 minutes. Staff was friendly, polite, and quick. All and all, a great place for Sunday morning breakfast."}
{"text":"i'm from the south (nc) and I thought a place called biscuits would be my savior and grace. but Houston we are still in Arizona.... you would think a place called biscuits you could actually get biscuits ya know biscuit sandwiches, turkey bacon and egg, cheese biscuits, any way you want a biscuit you know it is 2015 and the place is called biscuits...Just biscuits and gravy is all they have. So lame and so generic..but yeah its phoenix where im learning slowly after 2 years here that the majority doesn't know what real or good food is. Especially food with any sort of soul."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places in Ahwatukee. The huevos rancheros are delicious and they have a ton of really traditional menu items. The biscuits and gravy are also great. Everyone in my family loves this place and they have some of the friendliest service around."}
{"text":"I never expected to see a Biscuits open up over here. I'm glad they did though because it just brings great breakfast that much closer. It's a good change from the food that was at the club house before and it brings a lot more business to that area. Huevos rancheros, biscuits and gravy, and everything else I've had are great."}
{"text":"Place called biscuits better have good breakfast. What blows me away is how great the lunch is.  Tried meatloaf today, made better at home but best I've had elsewhere. I came just before two, bust time wrapping up lunch. What upset me was how they were \"training\" a bus boy. For over 15 min I had to hear about how poor his job has been.  (Place is very clean).  
I ate alone and have a lot on my mind.  Not was I was looking for.  
I'll be back for sure though. Bring family and visitors they will be jealous and get to see nice part of south mnt
 Bgood y'all"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken fried steak which was good. The scrambled that came with are ice cold. I ordered a side of extra crispy bacon  and it is really bad."}
{"text":"Huge portions, fast and friendly service, food was fresh, hot and cooked perfectly.   Prices higher than usual and the seat I chose was a bit lumpy, but the food was wonderful.  My husband and I both had the \"meat lovers\" breakfast.... whoa..  way too much food, we should have shared.  Ham was sweet, bacon smokey and marvelous.  Biscuit fluffy and delicious, and honey is on the table.  No dissatisfaction here as I waddle out the door...  Will be back..of course."}
{"text":"My 3rd visit to Biscuits.  First time, I fell in love. 2nd time, I fell out of love.
3rd time......they restored my love. I had the house omelette added bacon, green chili's and jalapeños. Best omelette EVER!! Also I'm not a usual home fries type of guy, but these were exceptional!!! I cleaned my plate......OK OK.....I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Came here Easter morning around 9am and the place was very packed! We ordered take out and waited in the waiting area.

Had the biscuits & gravy (how can I not when the restaurant is named after it, right?). The biscuits were so soft and fluffy, it was great! Gravy was tasty and not overly salty. BF had an omelet with sausage & mushrooms added which was huge and he enjoyed. Also, ordered a kids pancake meal for his nana (small appetite lady) and there was nothing small about it. The pancake was huge and came in the shape of mocked mouse :) it was pretty sweet itself and didn't require syrup. Nana enjoyed it and got a kick out of its shaped. Lol

Would come back..."}
{"text":"This has been my go to spot for breakfast and lunch in Ahwatukee since they opened in 2010. The food is excellent, the prices reasonable for the large portion sizes (I'm a big eater and usually go home with leftovers) and the service is always friendly and attentive even when busy. There are 2 other locations also, one in Tempe and the other in Gilbert. All 3 are freeway close. Stop in if you get a chance. I guarantee you will come away fat & happy and don't forget to tip your waitress."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast. Had the Biscuit Special. A big biscuit with gravy two eggs bacon and potatoes. The gravy was very good. Eggs cooked just right. Everything was cooked as I ordered. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday morning around 9am.  Had to wait about 20 minutes for a table.  Had a steady flow of people showing up so the place was busy.  

The food was average for breakfast.  I had the chicken fried steak with eggs and hash browns.  My wife had the biscuits with gravy.  Both portions were big so they get an extra star for that.  The hash browns good and the biscuits tasted home made. 

I took 2 stars away for the seating. We sat right next to the kitchen door.  

Service was good.  Drinks came right away and the food didn't take long either.   The waitress was very nice and checked on us a couple times."}
{"text":"Over priced food. The pancakes were under cooked. And we asked to redo them and they did, but of course soggy and gross. Bad service, gross bathrooms, (the employees just kept staring at us the whole time) overall not a good place to eat. And we got stomach aches after."}
{"text":"Really, really great place. Very good food and our server was really nice. Also the hostess was very nice even to the older guests that really could have tried her patience with where they wanted to sit. 

The only reason for not getting the last star is because the tables had a sticky feeling all over. They were clean but I think the varnish needs to be redone?? 

Really cute inside nice and bright."}
{"text":"Wifey and I here for the first time. She has the eggs Benedict. She said the coffee was fine not bitter although a bit weak in taste. I had water. Good. :) I also had the chicken fried steak with a side of Biscuits and also a side of bacon. Everything was really good. This place knows how to do breakfast!

This place can get busy and we we came on sat morning we did have to wait about 15 minutes. This is to be expected at a good place so we had no issue with waiting.

While everything was good, we feel for us this is a bit far for us to travel. My rating of 4/5 stars is for the food. We just felt that while good, it was not great, ie it was not made from scratch. Service was 5/5. If we lived closer, we would come more often."}
{"text":"Saw this place on yelp so we decided to try it out. Very glad we did. Our server was very nice and food came out fast. Hubby ordered the steak and eggs and he said the steak was very tender and not dry or tough like most places. I ordered the biscuits and gravy and was very pleased. Biscuits were perfect as you would hope considering the name of the place. We ordered eggs over medium and they were perfect. Overall great little breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with my boyfriend. Not impressed from the start but my boyfriend loves biscuits and gravy so we decided to stay. We were seated and given drinks rather quickly. Then we waited for the waitress to come back and take our order for a while. Then we received our food and it wasn't as good as I was expecting. I got the Eggs Benedict with country potatoes. It all had a pasty taste and was really just not good. Then it took forever for the waitress to come back to ask how everything was and just to check on us. Then took forever to get the bill for us to even be able to pay. That will probably be the only money they get from us. We should have made the drive to Scottsdale to go to Butters!"}
{"text":"Large breakfast portions and quick service. When I'm hungry for Sunday brunch, that's what I'm looking for. This restaurant delivers just that - even on a busy Father's day morning.

I ordered the Biscuits omelette which defaults with cheese. You can add a number of different mix-ins like green peppers, tomatoes, ham, bacon, spinach, etc. It also comes with a generous helping of either hash browns or loaded country potatoes. And, of course, top it off with a biscuit.

Every dish we ordered looked great. There happened to be a couple mistakes with ours, like accidentally bringing out an extra side bacon when we asked for hash browns. Though, if you ask me, that's not even a problem! After checking her notes, our waitress took the charge off our bill.

In case you're wondering, Biscuits is a locally owned operation, unlike Biscuits Cafe, a chain from Portland, OR. Honestly, both are very good, and just the ticket to any successful brunch!"}
{"text":"Fluffy, buttery, light biscuits are awesome, but those pancakes...those champion pancakes, they make the mandatory Sunday morning wait, although executed efficiently, totally worth it."}
{"text":"Love going here for breakfast.  Originally started going to another location when my husband and I lived in Gilbert and couldn't believe the huge portions you get for the good prices.  When we moved to  Phoenix I was so happy to see another location even though we would happily drive to Gilbert.  I have to wonder about the complaints I see on other reviews for \"too expensive\" or \"I didn't get enough food for the price\".  

I honestly can't think of anywhere else I could go to and get nearly as much food for as good a price.  I really don't understand the complaints from those who show up 20 minutes before close and don't understand why the staff doesn't want to stay for another hour or more just for you, that's pretty presumptuous.  This is a small, family restaurant, not a large chain with a big staff."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. Average, run of the mill breakfast joint. Food is average, service, average, decor, so-so. I had the corned beef hash with 2 eggs and ordered a side of Southern grits. The grits was overcooked like a silly putty, gravy was the same. The hash, way too salty. The only other item that was acceptable was the biscuit. At least they got that part right."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly.  Meal was brought out quick. I ordered the chicken fried steak, it was one of the best I have ever had. The plate was loaded with food. The restaurant was clean and the music in the background gives it a good vibe. I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is a great example of an old style diner. The average age on Sunday morning was 60+ and all heavy eaters. 

The food was good to average. I enjoyed the pancake, biscuit, eggs, grits and ham steak.  I sampled the gravy and it seemed pretty good as long as you like pepper. Overall I thought this place deserved better reviews than I read. We had great service and we were seated right away. 

My only suggestion would be that someone sell them some homemade local jelly or jam to top their biscuits with. I mean come on....small packets of Smuckers for their signature item?"}
{"text":"Okay, to start off with, if you want to eat healthy, keep moving.  This is true southern comfort breakfast food and it was really good.  The staff even put up with two members of my party having a water fight in the middle of eating.."}
{"text":"Good food,  bad service. 
Once your order is taken and the food is delivered your server becomes  MIA.
this is my second visit here and I have had the same experience both times. 
Get better service and you would have 4 stars easily."}
{"text":"If the name of your place is \"Biscuits\" then I would think that your biscuits would be amazing, these were eh at best."}
{"text":"I love this place.   Absolutely everything you would expect of a solid breakfast diner.  Biscuits are gravy are awesome. Go early on the weekends to avoid a wait."}
{"text":"I don't get all the hype. This place was about on par with Denny's, in my opinion. I ordered the biscuits and gravy meal with the eggs, meat and potato. The biscuits and gravy were just ok. The biscuit was soft and I'm sure delicious, but the gravy was nothing special. It lacked flavor and I wouldn't be surprised if it came out of a can or packet. Very underwhelming. My scrambled eggs were fine. The bacon was very very thin and small, but was cooked well. The country potatoes were more peppers than potato. Everything was just ok. I doubt I would go back. Especially when Black Bear Diner is right around the corner and is heads and tails better food-wise."}
{"text":"We liked it so much that we went back 2 more times!  Alondra is the hostess and she was so pleasant, happy, and very pretty to boot. Dawn was our server these times and she is really great. She is very efficient and the food is fast and wonderful. We had a lot of fun with her as she is also a Chicago fan."}
{"text":"I love this place so much that I will always remain loyal!  The service staff are friendly and they always remember us when we go. We've been trying new things on the menu and have nothing bad to say. Good size portions and very satisfying. Family friendly atmosphere and I found out today that they are only 6 years old!  I would definitely tell you to try it out."}
{"text":"One would think that the signature item that the restaurant is named after would be stellar, one would be wrong. The biscuits are okay at best. This restaurant just opened recently so I can excuse some of the server's inadequacies, however the mediocre food not so much. Their house omelet with just plain cheese is $6.79, if you want anything more it's $0.85 for a meat to be added or $0.65 per vegetable, not great pricing for a simple omelet. I received my breakfast in 2 stages (weird) and didn't get a biscuit, the bite that I took of my companions was more than enough! This place is definitely for the older crowd, it's Ahwatukee so that's fine, but a restaurant shouldn't just cater to that demographic. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic, took my two work buddies here and we all got the biscuits and gravy and it was amazing and a ton of food for your money. Reminds me of home cooking in grandmas kitchen, yum!!!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! The GRITS are to die for! Southern home made grits. The interior leaves a little to be desired however the food makes up for the lack or over pour of decor. The menu offered a lot to choose from. Wait staff is always friendly and will always take the time to help you decide what to order. Always a hit when we eat here!"}
{"text":"Drove over a half hour to have a late breakfast with my mom & we ended up not staying long... Not only were my mom's biscuits harder than hard (not even a knife could cut through them), but I found the longest hair in my potatoes that did not belong to either of us or our waitress. Even though the manager said neither has happened before, the waitress seemed more irritated than surprised.

It was my first time at any Biscuits location & most definitely will be my last."}
{"text":"I went for lunch today with friends after a hike.  We were hungry.

I had a lunch meal.  The sandwich was fresh, hot and generous.  My side salad was wilted.  I would have thrown out the lettuce in my home.

One of my friends had a traditional breakfast, and he said he was great.  Eggs cook properly, and again generous portions.

My last friend (at breakfast, not on the face of the earth)  had a breakfast burrito, and said it was very good.  I think my salad was the weakest link.

The service was good, and everyone seemed very friendly.  We were seated within 10 minutes, and being warned there would be a wait.  They left carafes of coffee, iced tea, and soda on the table for self-refilling.

The prices were fine.  I'd go back, but avoid the salad...at least at lunch time."}
{"text":"Judging by the cars in the parking lot I had already guessed the patron demographic and I was not let down. Upon entering we were promptly greeted by a very very sweet woman rest of the staff followed in kind.

Quaint does not even begin to describe Biscuits. While waiting in the lobby to be seated you sit on haystacks surrounded by cute kitschy stuff you might have seen at your grandma's house.

Once seated we requested coffee and were served the typical watered-down diner type coffee. I ordered my typical cheese omelette with hash browns and got a decent omelette it was okay.  I don't think that omelettes are the primary entree for this restaurant. 

I do believe the name says it all. I'm not a toast and biscuit type person but my husband is. He absolutely could not say enough good things about the biscuits."}
{"text":"I've read a lot of the reviews, and have to shake my head... This place is as close as you're going to get to a home cooked meal, in a major city!! The staff treats you like family, and the food is awesome!! Biscuits also supports the community and brings a real small town vibe to Ahwatukee!! I'm thankful it's right across the street from me :)"}
{"text":"Hello everyone let me just say Biscuits is an awesome brunch place to eat ! Great portions and great service ! The country fried chicken is a great breakfast dish . Try the biscuits here duh !!! So fluffy and yummy !!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast at a great price. Awesome portions of tasty food. The biscuits Benedict is tasty! The friendly staff and awesome service keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"I'm sure Sam's gives a lot of people a look at this new location.  Opposed to others we ate on the one evening they are open, Friday.  At 5:30 it was relatively quiet with about 5 or 6 tables occupied.  The place looked clean as was the silverware.  Three of us ordered the fish fry and my wife ordered chicken fried chicken, mashed potatoes and white gravy and she substituted fried okra for the corn on the menu.  Her potatoes and gravy were good, portions large, chicken tender and moist inside, crisp outside but the fried okra were still frozen in the center.  They immediately took them back and out came well fried okra.  The fried fish was served in red plastic baskets and came with 3 pieces of cod fish, french fries, cole slaw and 2 sauces, tartar and red cocktail.  None of us tried the cocktail sauce.  The basket was small and uncomfortable to eat from as the paper liner dissolved from the ketchup and oil from the fried food.  The french fries were pale, limp and under cooked but we didn't send them back, should have.  The fish had a good crunch and fresh flavor and the tartar sauce was fair.  All the meals were just a tad under $10 each. I deduct a star for the under cooked okra and fries and a half star for the skimpy baskets the meals were served in, so I give 3.5 stars overall.  I will probably return to try their breakfasts."}
{"text":"I'd really love to add another star here. The only thing that is lacking is a bit more ambience. I'm no interior designer so I can't really help. I wish it were a bit more homey, that's all. Maybe flowers on the table, table cloths? 

So that being said, the food is awesome, large portions and very, very fresh. The service is fast and pleasant. You can build your own omelette but be sure to ask them for light oil and no cheese if you're watching your calories. I forgot to do that and my first bite was yummy good. Then, oh.  No wonder. Butter! Don't get me wrong, I love me lotsa butter, but not when I trying to lose a few LB's.  Did I eat it?  You betcha! I had eggs white with asparagus and avocado. So good. 

Also the beverages are  HUGE!  See my pic and how the drink sizes are compared to a pack of Splenda. 

Bottom line, great service, yummy food. And plenty of parking!"}
{"text":"This is a \"brunch\" place.  They close at 2pm.  We came here around noon.  It's in the Sam's parking lot.

The decor is sort of confused.  Part of it seems like a road-side country stand with corrugated iron walls, but then it has those translucent curtains on the windows one might see in one's grandma's kitchen.  This isn't a problem, but I did notice it.  The music was nice...instead of top 40 they were playing older rock and easy listening.  That seemed to fit the ambiance.

The menu is American country cuisine.  Comfort food.  We ordered off the lunch menu.  I had the meatloaf with red wine gravy, my wife had the chicken-fried chicken.  Both entrees were really good.  Both were accompanied by mashed potatoes (whose primary seasoning appeared to be pepper).  The chicken also came with corn, the meatloaf came with sauteed zucchini and asparagus.  They were nothing special (the corn was buttery, the other vegetables were...well...vegetables).  The white gravy on the potatoes (and chicken) was surprisingly nice (I've never been a fan of that when I get chicken-fried steak or chicken).  The sauce on the meatloaf was a brown sauce, apparently made with wine.  Plus the meat was seasoned nicely.  No ketchup glaze here!!

All in all, it was a nice and satisfying meal.  Not gourmet by any means, but American comfort food done very well.  And the pricing and portions were reasonable."}
{"text":"We went there once because we were in the area and it was rated as the best place to get biscuits and gravy. Our food was good. Menu is SOOO PACKED with items you can order. If we're in the area we might stop by again but will not be making a special trip for it."}
{"text":"I woke up this morning dreaming of biscuits and Gravy (I'm from the dirty south so I'm pretty sure this is normal). Told my wife let's go get us some biscuits and Gravy. We found this place we have never been. The staff is super friendly and have that southern charm. I ordered the way of my dream and got their special with eggs, bacon, hash browns and of course biscuits and Gravy. The time they got our order out was super quick which is great, but the scrambled eggs appeared like the boxed kind I got in the Army with just a tad bit more flavor. The hash browns were awesome. The biscuits and Gravy were a bit under flavor. The biscuits were good but for some reason I couldn't get myself feeling like the Gravy was fulfilling my dream :(. Overall the experience was great and that in itself deserves the 4 or 5 stars but the food underwhelmed my expectations. Maybe I'm be overly critical bc I am from the place biscuits and Gravy is a staple and makes you walk a bit slower after eating."}
{"text":"Eggs, potatoes, bacon were all pretty good.  Oddly, biscuits and gravy were the least impressive part of the meal.  Not a bad meal, but a bit pricey for what it is."}
{"text":"I don't like giving restaurants 5 stars, like my old commander used to say \"there's always room for improvement\", but as far as good old fashion comfort food this is the place. Growing up both my grandmother's used to make homemade biscuits and gravy, best part of any weekend morning. This place reminded me of my childhood. The portions are huge. Everything is fresh, for example the eggs are farm fresh, you can taste the difference. The gravy is to die for, it has the creamy peppery taste. The bacon is the perfect texture, it had that crisp but chewy texture. Then there's the biscuits. If you include a food item into the name of the restaurant it better be amazing,  and it was. They were so fluffy and delicious. You will definitely see me again."}
{"text":"Okay...so I read reviews of this place and most are good...I highly recommend you to ignore the bad reviews by the way!  This place is by far the best breakfast place ever...I'll tell why...so I was never a fan of chicken fried steak, at least not until I came here...woooowwww! If you don't know what to get...I highly recommend the chicken fried steak, their home cooked gravy is what seals the deal on this one, same goes for their biscuits and gravy.  Now if you make it around the lunch time...I recommend the steak sandwich! The meat is nice and tender and full of flavor....I can't speak for the other dishes....but this place is definitely worth a shot!!!"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday morning at 10. Just the two of us and we waited about 25 min.  The place was packed. I know a lot of people are saying the service was bad but,  ours was fine.  Food came out hot and fast. Cooked perfectly. I had biscuits and gravy.  I used to run a restaurant so I can tell you with a pretty good degree of certainty that it was the same stuff we served. Already cooked and chopped sausage squares that you toss in a white gravy that you make by adding water and milk to a powder, evidenced by the pure whitness of the gravy,  homemade gravy is a brown/white color. It was pretty good, not the down home, made with sausage fat type that I'm used to (I'm from Amish country and they do it up right) but still tasty. I would order it again.  My husband ordered chicken fried chicken and he cleaned his plate. He did stop short of licking it clean, but had no one been looking he probably would have. The biscuits were great.  The server brought us a to go box and the bill promptly and even a to go cup to take my soda in.  She was polite and attentive. 

The decor is county kitsch,  made to look like a barn. Seemed clean from what I saw, I do wish they wouldn't leave rolled silverware on the table in mason jars though; you never if they've been messed with and kids especially do disgusting things and handle everything.  All in all we will return and had a good experience.  

Hats off to the hostess and server dealing with the crazy lady that lost her cell phone and decided to take it out on the staff. They handled it very well and didn't lose their cool."}
{"text":"Best country fried steak and gravy I had on this side of the Valley. 5-stars.  The meat tasted very fresh and juicy while the exterior was crunchy.  Perfect!!

Grits are very fresh and tasty as well.  Biscuits are hot and fresh made.  I had the hamburger steak plate last time and it was a solid 4-stars.

Good home cooking here with hearty and fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  The biscuits are soooo good.  I had biscuits and gravy and it did not disappoint.  I could only eat half it was such a huge portion.  The staff is very friendly and attentive.  The wait time for food was definitely acceptable and the restrooms smell like bacon!  My husband had the blueberry pancake and I must say this was the best blueberry pancake we have had at any breakfast restaurant.  Big plump and fresh blueberries with warm syrup.  This is one of our favorite spots.  We are planning to try the fish fry next."}
{"text":"The breakfast here was to die for and the staff was supper friendly and upbeat. Recommend this place to anyone looking for some good traditional food / breakfast."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, service is terrible. Ordered ahead for take out. Arrived 20 min later, as I was told that is when it would be ready. It wasn't even started. 
It took another 35 min to get my food. Only to discover order was wrong. 
I would avoid take out here at all costs. Hardly worth the wait and mix up."}
{"text":"The food is really good! I got the corned beef and hash and my husband got the chicken fried steak; both were really good and we would have enjoyed it more if the hostess wasn't rude. I want to go back because our food was good, but it really put a bad taste in our mouth with the rude hostess before we sat down. Expect to wait for a table because the space is a bit small, but what's a wait for good food, right! I'm hoping we can give this place another shot and banking on a bad day for the hostess."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we loved it! Great service, prices were good, food was phenomenal. Couldn't ask for anything better, only concern is that the entire restaurant is booths so I don't see how I could bring in a large party.."}
{"text":"Friendly people. Fast service! Got the biscuits with scrambled eggs and hash browns. Food served super hot but tasty and filling. Comfortable place for Sunday brkfst!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were first timers to BISCUITS & I don't think I (we) can say one thing negative. Talk about a huge breakfast. This place is locally family owned, we like that. The biscuits and gravy are amazing, hug, soft, flaky biscuits. Ha a basic all American breakfast. He said the hash browns were great, eggs fixed perfectly and the biscuit was really good. The decor country and homey. Our waitress/hostess was one of the owners, sweet! Other plates that went by for other patrons looked all so good. Our first experience at BISCUITS and we will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"Wanted a nearby breakfast and picked this for the reviews. I was seated immediately, and within a minute I had water and a carafe if coffee from a very friendly server. My order arrived quickly. The eggs were perfectly done, as was the chicken fried chicken. Most restaurants serve chicken fried anything as hard as a rock, but this was crispy outside, soft and juicy inside. The gravy was maybe a bit bland, but very smooth and tasty. Country potatoes were grilled rather than deep fried and done just right. I will definitely be back. Eat here! You'll be glad you did"}
{"text":"I've been here probably a dozen times now for both breakfast and lunch and the food is always very good. However, I'm only giving the 3 stars because the service is awful! I either have to wait forever to either get a menu or place my order. If a waitress asks you if you need a minute or two to decide what you want say NO and just pick something to order! Because a minute or two to them is about ten minutes in real time! This has happened several times to me. And yesterday I was done with my meal for at least 15 minutes and my plate had already been cleared away and I still didn't have my bill. I didn't see my server anywhere around and the other servers wouldn't even look in my direction when I tried to flag them down. Once I finally got my bill I took it to the front counter to pay and wait a couple more minutes because nobody was there. I finally just left enough cash to cover my bill on the counter and left. I like their food but if the service continues like it has I'll be finding a new place, even if it's out of my way!"}
{"text":"Biscuits...should be called, \"assload of biscuits.\" A family restaurant specializing in breakfast and lunch, this place doesn't disappoint. Breakfast food abounds and you can get other dishes to your heart's content. They will let you play with the dishes a bit - playing with what you get and will let you know if there is going to be an upcharge or not.

Military discounts are offered - have ID available. Doesn't transfer to your party though so don't try."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places we have found in Arizona! The wait was pretty long when we arrived, but it was definitely worth it!  The service is fast and friendly, and the biscuits of course were delicious.  Probably some of the best hash browns I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Walked in for a birthday breakfast as a first time.. wasn't impressed. I ordered the biscuits and gravy and the biscuits needed the gravy (which was also less than impressive). We walked in and menus were handed to someone to seat us, maybe a busser.. a couple minutes later the server came over. Not super helpful with the menu, and then the ticket was dropped pretty quickly. There were maybe four tables seated at that time. I don't think I'll be back. It was a very lackluster experience."}
{"text":"Amazing pancakes, grits and biscuits!!!!! Wonderful, friendly staff and service!  Will definitely return the next time we are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The place is like a no-fuss, down to earth diner.  And, at a diner I expect, great fast service, decent food, good portions and a CLEAN place.  

Biscuits was there on all counts.  The waitress was very efficient and thorough.  (I like when you don't need to ask for refills on coffee).  The portions were HUGE.  Prices really reasonable.

No nonsense place to go to without having to travel far.  Nice local crowd.  Good space and a real plus to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This rating is only for their fish. The food looks great and my friend loved her ham omelette but I've been on a journey to find the best Friday Fish Fry. So, even though I wanted something else on their menu (a lot of meals on their menu), I tried the fish. It rated at the bottom of my list. It was not good at all. Just blah!!! I will go back but will never get their fish again."}
{"text":"This was my second visit after enjoying the first visit very much. Boy, I was in for a rude surprise. 

There were several empty tables and a lot of people waiting. There were a couple who came in about 15 minutes after us. When someone finally called the next customer, it was the people who came in after me that got the table before us- we were the exact same number of guests. I was shocked and made sure it was known by me throwing my hands in the air to acknowledge we were there first. 

I observed the busboy dropping a wet rag on the high traffic and dirty floor. He picked it up and went on to wash several tables. Oh my gosh! NO!!!!!!!

I was looking forward to ordering the very same choices as the first visit. I enjoyed the food from the first visit so I wanted a repeat. I was bummed. Everything tasted different. Omelette overcooked and dry. Smaller portion of hash browns. Grits was really dry. My daughter ordered the same food as the first visit yet was very underwhelmed and disappointed."}
{"text":"Not a good experience at all.  We tried this when it first opened and we were underwhelmed but we decided to give it another chance and that was a mistake.

First, when  went to sip my coffee, there was a dead FLY in it.  I showed it to the server (not my own because we never saw her) and she didnt even apologize and just took it away.  How can you not even acknoweldge it or take it off the bill???  it was nasty!!

The place overall was dirty - dust on the windowsills, old food on table, etc...

While the host was friendly, my server was terrible.  She took our order and dropped our check and that is all we saw of her.  I had to keep flagging other people down to help me (a bus boy, a different server, and the host).

Disappointed I gave it a second chance and will not give it a 3rd or go back."}
{"text":"Came in for Father's Day breakfast, it was busy as expected. Everyone in my party was quite satisfied with our food, service was good. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very fast service, very food food. Fluffy eggs, crispy bacon, great biscuits, and the CHAMPION PANKCAKE!!!! Oh man! Great atmosphere, very friendly staff.  Kinda reminds me of Penrose Diner in South Philly.  So good,,,"}
{"text":"Biscuits and sausage gravy.  So.  Freaking.  Yum.

I've been here twice and the service isn't that great which is surprising because these seem like career servers.  But the restaurant is clean and the biscuits and gravy are the second best I've ever had in my life."}
{"text":"Our team went here yesterday to celebrate CeCe's birthday.  It's a few doors down from Los Taquitos - and I have driven past many times, but was skeptical for many reasons.

The décor / ambiance reminded me of all the reasons I moved away from Idaho.  Immediately when you walk in there is a giant painting of a barn - and scattered bales of hay covered in grandma's quilts... if that doesn't remind you of home cookin' I don't know what will.

We were seated, and as I perused the menu, nothing was sticking out as appetizing.  Finally I settled on the reuben, which was recommended by our waitress, a lifer, who was actually really sweet and funny.  In regards to service, at least her service, I would give this joint five stars.  

The corned beef on the sando was delicious, and the kraut was well seasoned.  Overall, it was one of the better reubens I've had here on the west coast.  The other item our table ordered that got rave reviews was the chicken fried chicken and club sandwich.

I think, in this case, I just cannot get past the decor.  It looked exactly like the majority of restaurants that Chef Ramsey walks into before making Kitchen Nightmare makeover suggestions.  Random shoddy wooden chickens and dusty relics you'd see in a thrift store for good reason.

So - to my wonderful waitress, great job for making the most of what you have to work with... but to the rest of you, just go next door and get the carne asada @ Los Taquitos."}
{"text":"I like my diners greasy, with no frills. Biscuits delivers on both and throws in a side of homemade biscuit. For example, they have a dish called \"WWII Spam and Eggs.\" You get (no surprises here) fried spam, eggs, hash browns/potatoes and a signature biscuit. They also have some \"specialty\" items like French Toast with bananas and Nutella and healthier items like Steel cut Oatmeal, in case you or someone you're with is feeling fancy. 

Biscuits gets a solid 4 stars because: 

- Spam (I could stop here but I'll keep going)
- the location
- the target audience
- the \"comfort food\" menu
- super friendly, down to earth, happy staff!
- your own pot of coffee for the table

Tip - any active or retired military receives 10% discount."}
{"text":"Best place for southern lovin' breakfast! From corn beef n hash to country fried chicken! This place is amazing! The biscuits are the bomb! Heaven in your mouth!"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday. The wait was 45 min. I had high expectations cuz of the other reviews. Our food was just meh... so so. Nothing to write home about. Maybe it would be better on a non busy day."}
{"text":"I took my parents here when they were visiting two years ago and they loved it. Now, every time they visit, we have to come here for breakfast. Apparently, things have declined. The food was cold, the champion pancake was undercooked, our waitress never came back to check on us, and she told us she was bringing our check three different times. When paying, the cashier asked how the food was and my father said in a disappointed tone, \"Adequate.\" which the cashier never replied to, not even to apologize."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I have not tried the food at Biscuits due to the website having the incorrect hours listed.  I got a recommendation from a friend and was really looking forward to trying the home cooking. I called in for a pick up order on Saturday at 2:15 and was informed that the restaurant was closed. The hours on the menu and elsewhere list that the restaurant is open until 3pm on Saturday and Sunday. Please correct this."}
{"text":"Best place to get breakfast in AZ.  This place has great fresh food that is local.  The portions are huge (the side of biscuits is two who biscuits).  The wait tends to be long on the weekends, but trust me when I tell you that it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Great price and really generous portions. They also use real bacon that are huge and give three pieces (most places give you two). Anyways it was a lot of food for less than ten bucks. Owner came out and greeted each table, server was pretty attentive and brought all of our food out at the same time."}
{"text":"Place was a cute little diner that's family owned. It was like being in a movie! I love how it's old school decorated. I ordered fish and chips and it was amazing! My husband ordered the ham steak breakfast and he loved it! The only thing I didn't really like was that we weren't really taken care of. The lady served us but never came back until she gave us our food. We had to steal some utensils from another table and they never asked if we needed any water refill or anything. It wasn't busy either so not sure why we didn't receive better service. If the food wasn't great I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"The breakfast portion is huge.  I enjoyed every delicious bite.  This really filled me up.  I have leftovers for another meal later, that is how huge the portion is."}
{"text":"Had breakfast at Biscuits for the first time today.  Pretty good food and service was adequate.  The carpet looked like it could use a good cleaning.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place been coming here for years since opening Gilbert.  Service staff is always outstanding.

Best quality breakfast meats in town.  Of course their biscuits & gravy is awesome.   But I also recommend trying their champion pancakes or build an omelet, whichever suits your fancy.

I'm usually disappointed when I go somewhere else in town for breakfast. I highly recommend you try this place!"}
{"text":"How do you bring an order out wrong TWICE. 

& How do you mix up an English muffin from a biscuit TWICE. 

I paid $5 for an egg I could have made at home...."}
{"text":"Recommended by another RVer when asked for best breakfast places in Chandler/Gilbert area. My wife loved order smothered in sausage gravy. I had the Eggs Benedict, which was wonderful as were the grits, which aren't on many menus.  We intend to try other breakfast restaurants in the area, but we definitely will be back to Biscuits, since there are other items we'd like to order."}
{"text":"Just ate here for my first time. Great food, great price, awesome customer service. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Soo good! Pancakes are huge and filling! So if you order three pancakes, you will not finish them... Trust me! Friendly staff. Must try at least once!"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to this place. Super friendly from the moment I walked in, to the moment I left. Food was exactly what I expected, home cooked style like mom would make. Pricing was a little bit high but not outrageous. I will most certainly be coming back."}
{"text":"Good service, food was OK. I've tried the pancakes twice and how can I put this? There's no way around it, they're not good. They were burned the first time and both times hard and not very tasty. The basic fare (eggs, bacon, potatoes) were good but Biscuits will not be my first breakfast place choice."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty joint that includes fresh OJ! I got the south mountain scramble with a side cinnamon roll. If you choose this dish, make sure you come hungry, there's quite a bit to take down. Comes with your choice of a side (hash browns and potatoe something).

The cinnamon roll was, mm, ok. Overall, a place I'd come back to.


Cheers!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for breakfast. The chicken fried chicken is amazing! Try it with the hash browns. Your taste buds will be thanking you all day! Really!

Also note worthy are the breakfast burrito with chorizo and the champion pancake!"}
{"text":"Wow, found this on Yelp this morning and thought we would give it a try. We got 1 biscuit and gravy, 2 eggs, potatoes with green peppers, and a slice of ham. Pam was our waitress and she was so helpful and pleasant, it was refreshing! It was the best biscuit and gravy that I ever had! Everything else was very good. We are taking some friends with us tomorrow to eat again"}
{"text":"We've been here twice, tried different items both times. We don't have any complaints. Delicious food, great service."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place because it's close to our house and looked cute. It's cute. It's a neighborhood spot. The food was ok. Just ok. I could make a better breakfast at home. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Love Biscuits! We always have good service and food is awesome with the exception of the Tuna Melt. We always are seated quickly with a clean environment. Kinda becoming a regular.."}
{"text":"This was good.  Went for breakfast with some family.  Very busy but I feel the wait was worth it.  Good food, large portions and good service.  We will return but may try to find a time when the wait is shorter.  All in all, very well done."}
{"text":"Menu is scattered and a bit difficult to read. It is difficult to tell whether or not this is family owned. 

I will say that the champion pancakes were quite delicious.
A perfect blend of whole grains, flax, granola, almonds, and blueberries."}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants you drive by all the time but rarely stop there to eat. You should. It's home style breakfast and really good."}
{"text":"Quite a little tasty breakfast spot! Biscuits and gravy were good and the pancakes were good! The staff was very friendly and on top of everything! Would visit again!"}
{"text":"The hubby ordered the TLT (turkey, lettuce, & tomato) and he thought it was a tasty sandwhich. It came with a large side salad and two dill pickles. I ordered the Standard Breakfast with turkey sausage, country potatoes, & a biscuit. Now I am a big breakfast person and could really eat breakfast (especially eggs) any time of the day or night. The eggs were cooked to my liking (over medium), the potatoes were soft but not mushy. They weren't crispy but I was glad they weren't greasy. Def had flavor. The turkey sausage was delicious! Finally, I really liked their fluffy biscuits and I'm not a biscuit person. We'll be coming back here soon."}
{"text":"Amazing! When we went out to breakfast we were not originally planning eating here but with other restaurants having long waits we opted to go here. I was so pleased!! The service was great and the food was even better! The food came out shortly after ordering."}
{"text":"New in Ahwatukee area and probably a great example of why Restaurants have such a great failure rate. A great concept very poorly executed!

While my \"Test Breakfast\" was absolutely awful, I was more interested in the comments of the people around me. 

\"Very slow service.\" 

\"Doesn't taste like a pancake.\"

\"Even the coffee is awful.\"

\"This sausage tastes like bologna.\"

My \"Test?\"

Sausage Gravy and Biscuits. Seems for a place named \"Biscuits,\" this dish should be a trademark signature dish. Absolutely awful taste! Made with link sausage and the fellow \"breakfaster\" was correct, when he said that the sausage tasted like bologna! The gravy was pasty and tasted like flour with no sausage taste at all. Not even a butter taste to it. Quite possibly the worst I have ever had! 

The biscuits you ask? Awful as well, being thin and tasteless bordering on way too salty and equally inedible.

Incidentally, when asked \"how was everything\" I replied \"not good,\" the Cashier didn't follow up to ask what was wrong, she just gave me my change and said \"thanks for coming in.\"

They will have to get lots better in order to make it. I won't try it again, but my prediction is they won't last."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time....not great, not bad!!  Typical chain breakfast diner.  The biscuits were delicious though!!"}
{"text":"I went there to get some breakfast.. When I got there at first , people were very polite and nice and was seated promptly. However when the food came, I finished my plate within eight minutes thinking that maybe they would've supplied me with more food on the plate than just a biscuit two eggs and hashbrowns. I was still hungry. At least add a sausage &  bacon and toast on the side with my order. Food was very expensive for the amount of food I ate. I complained to the host &  she told me to give my name & number (which I did) (but never got a phone call back.  I will not be going back!  ."}
{"text":"Meh..this place is just ok for me..maybe mainly because I'm usually on a healthy kick and there is not a lot of options for people watching their carbs... Plus the side of fresh fruit was like $5-yikes!"}
{"text":"Called four different times this morning to make an order to go and never managed to get my call answered. I can't imagine they are so busy right now that no one can answer the phone. Have heard great things about this establishment and was excited to try the new location that just opened down the street! Hopefully others have had better experiences getting their orders called in, will have to try going in another morning and see if the service at the restaurant is actually decent."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Enjoyed the breakfast and will be returning soon. We were seated quickly anf the service was great.  The portion size was large and the coffee was great."}
{"text":"Best eggs and biscuits I've had.  Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been coming here for a few weeks now and I feel obligated to write a review because I am in love with their Champion Pancakes (Blueberries, Cinnamon, Oats, Almonds). 

I tried these on our 2nd visit and haven't had anything else since. Maybe I'll update when I try something else but for now I'm recommending this place because these pancakes are some of the best I've ever had. I'll be a recurring customer til they take these off the menu.

Everytime we get a chance now and we are going to breakfast I always suggest this place. I think she hates it now because of me but it'll always have a chunk of my heart."}
{"text":"This was a decent breakfast. I had one of the specials, good biscuits and gravy and the fruit was very good. It's about what you would expect."}
{"text":"We were underwhelmed. My boyfriend had eggs benedict and everything was overcooked or lacked any real flavor. Came with a thin side of burnt to a crisp barely edible hash browns. I dont know how you could make that meal bland but they did it. I had their buscuit special with eggs. The eggs were dry and taste like they were going bad. The biscuits were served cold and again, everything was bland. Its not the worst resturant, but I wont consider coming back. There are much better places out there."}
{"text":"Just ok. A little bland on the flavors, pancakes and biscuits are \" doughy\". French toast was was tasty, service was just ok."}
{"text":"Great service and amazing homestyle breakfast! Seriously best biscuits and gravy in town."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast, Sunday morning.  Seated right away, and then counted ourselves lucky as the door filled with people and a waiting group.  But then we sat and sat and sat.  No water, no coffee ..... 
I appreciate a \"rush\" and the poor waitress in our section was overwhelmed with tables.  But bus staff could water/coffee tables.  And an older man that I later learned was the owner, could have also helped out.  He was standing around talking to staff, or stood around register looking around, while they were clearly overwhelmed with work and while customers like us languished, parched and hungry.
Meanwhile, 15 minutes go by and we STILL have no water or coffee offered.  Finally we see the waitress who had our table go to the manager and express herself at which time he sent over a young man to take our order.  I'm afraid I was a bit snippy with him about the wait, for which he apologized.  Took our order and promptly brought water/coffee - apologizing again for the wait (not his fault, but good customer service on his part).  
Rest of meal was pleasant - cooked to order. Waiter remained attentive, but not overly so.  
Waiter gets 5 stars in my book for handling a difficult situation with good customer service and good attitude. 
Manager/Owner gets 1 star for poor management and poor support of his staff.   When the place is overrun, a managers place is in keeping organized and order; and making sure this customers are serviced properly by being sure his staff is supported.  He was basking in his cash register and pontificating to his staff, instead of making sure his staff had all the help they needed, which in turn would have provided his customers with a far superior experience."}
{"text":"Great food, huge portions, and a friendly staff.  Will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Really good bacon,  but pricy. Will return if in the area, service was friendly and they are hard workers. Nice environment.  Love diners ."}
{"text":"Will have to stick to the other location. Started when a family was seated before us that had  the same amount of people as us . Like we were sitting there 10 mins and they had just walked in. 

There was only one server in the room portion we were in and she was clearly overwhelmed and forgetful. There was cheese in our omelette when we ask for none, no plate for my daughter with whom I was sharing, we never got a pot of coffee like all the other tables , it took a long time just to get a cup of coffee etc.



Also incredibly loud as our table was right behind the kitchen / bussing table."}
{"text":"Biscuits is back! Everyone support local and come up to Club West and try out Biscuits.Had brunch there and the menu is extensive, yummy and great prices! 

They have brunch, lunch and now a full dinner  menu! Kept the Friday fish fry but also  doing a surloin night.  

Come into the Foothills and support this local business. We need it!"}
{"text":"It was good, big portions, with tasty biscuits."}
{"text":"Good little Mom & Pop breakfast joint.  The owner is retired Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant and is super friendly.  Being a Marine veteran myself, this place has already scored points with me.  The food's pretty good, better than average but definitely has some room for improvements; not enough to turn me away from the place.

Being a creature of habit, I always get the country fried steak and eggs with a biscuit.  They're fairly consistent with their preparation of it too.

Coffee is....well, it's diner coffee, which really only adds to the charm of the place because really, I do sort of see it more of a diner than a restaurant.  I think they should really throw in a counter and some stools.

And of course their biscuits...  By naming your place Biscuits, I think you set the customer's expectations of the biscuits pretty high.  Don't expect too much and you'll find that their biscuits are pretty good."}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast food spot. Good family owned restaurant and reasonably priced.  Our favorites are the egg and sausage biscuits and the protein pancake. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Just finished breakfast. My omelet was way overcooked and my friends eggs and potatoes wete cold. They gave him new potatoes but left him with cold eggs. We should have gone to our trusty Black Bear Diner just up the street. We just spent $26 for two breakfasts neither of us enjoyed. What a waste of money."}
{"text":"Buscuits from the freezer and gravy from a can.  How can your signature dish, which is fairly easy to make, taste like cardboard? So disappointed... And weird atmosphere too:/"}
{"text":"The 5 of us had a great breakfast every item was spot on taste temperature and service the prices were great also we were seated in a booth and served coffee  and water promptly food came out quickly"}
{"text":"The cashier was very rude and on mother's day, wouldn't let me order food while others already ate she preferred to ring them up first, even though I was in line prior to these customers. . . very poor customer service, I have never eaten at this restaurant and now never will, was so looking forward to my mother's day meal from this place ooh well. Ihop treated me much nicer"}
{"text":"Very good mom and pop restaurant with nice atmosphere.This is not a place where you go for a healthy breakfast or the atmosphere, unless you're 70. 

I ordered the biscuit plate which included biscuits and gravy, eggs, meat and grits. Like a lot of places I've noticed recently the portions are huge, so unless you have giant sized appetite I'd advise sharing the meal.

My food was warm and had a homemade taste to it. My waitress was less than friendly, but I chalk that up to maybe she was having a bad day.

When we finished eating the owner (I think) came by and asked if everything was ok because he saw I only ate half of everything but I assured him the food was good but the portions were just so large.

If you want a homemade breakfast this is the place for you. My breakfast for two was about  $30.00."}
{"text":"We always run out of options for a Friday lunch. I used to work around the valley and was always looking for nice traditional food. Happened to find this amazing place in the corner of a plaza. 
I love how nicely this restaurant is set up. Its cute to spend a nice afternoon or even so for a nice heavy brunch. People are very friendly and service is pretty quick. 

I have ordered grilled chicken with mashed potatoes and veggies. The chicken cooked to perfection and sauce on the side, along with mashed potatoes which just melted as you take a bite. I was a little disappointed with the fish and chips. The fish is great with the crispness perfect but the slices are so huge that when you are half way through, the mid section of the fish is not so tasty. 

Overall  this place is amazing and will keep returning. I so want to try the breakfast menu and get back on the reviews."}
{"text":"We found this place on a whim on a Saturday morning meandering through this part of town and decided to gave it a try.   It looked like one of those mom and pop small businesses that was trying to give it hell and the wife and I were hungry.   Plus, they had good yelp reviews.  

I was hinting toward the Huevos Racheros, and our servers high recommendation of them put me over the top.   It's his wife's favorite he said, with a pretty huge smile.   I bought right in.   The wife got some sort of bacon and egg thing on a biscuit.    The food came out quickly and looked great.    It smelled great.  

The Huevos Racheros were really quite good.   My wife, who is like a canary in a coalmine when food is bad, quickly endorsed what she ordered, and gave high marks on the biscuit itself.  A good sign, for a place named Biscuits, at least I thought so.  Nailed it.  

Yeah!   We'd come back here again and eat here no problem.   Food is good, the service is fast and friendly, and the place is clean.   NIcely done!  

4 Stars Easy."}
{"text":"Very good county breakfast. 
I got the chicken fried chicken, very moist, with hashbrowns, eggs over medium, wheat toast.
Everything was very good, service was awesome.
Dad got egg whites, pork sausage, hashbrowns, wheat toast, he said everything was very good. 
A great way to start our day at barrett Jackson auction. 
The entrance is on the south west side of building, we did not see the signs until after we parked. So it was a Little walk."}
{"text":"This place has such reasonable prices and a great breakfast/ lunch menu. But overall the food did not meet my expectations. Not a gluten free friendly menu at all. The French fries couldn't be made gf because they came out of a box. I ordered the shrimp and chips (subbed the chips out for corn). The coleslaw that came with was ok. The shrimp was gross. They were not cleaned properly and also had some grit in them. Therefore the food i ordered was very disappointing. Over all, I might come back and order something different because the prices and atmosphere were good. But not making plans to do that any time soon."}
{"text":"My first time here. Service was great! Food halfway good. My eggs were burnt, the server offered to replace them but I was done eating by then. Disappointed that a breakfast restaurant would serve brown eggs. Yuck. The biscuits were phenomenal and grits were yummy."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast. Biscuits and gravy were really good. Hash browns were perfect. But the pancakes. Oh my."}
{"text":"Biscuts, Mmmmm sounds like a tasty sandwich place from the south, Wrong, Food was average at best. The food was Bland and tasteless, eggs were over cooked. This is not someplace to eat. When I expressed my opinion they said we had a lot of regulars, Not sure how you can have regulars when the place just opened. The remodel of the building looked like volunteers did the work and had no remodel experience. I suspect this place will close and another empty building will be for rent. There only chance is hungry shoppers from Sams Club."}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast.....decent service with a nice roomy dining area.
Get used to one thing eating breakfast out these days.....it is not cheap.
30 bucks with tip for 2 people.....yikes!"}
{"text":"Delicious gravy! As expected. Delicious diet coke! Decent service. The guy working the register had jazzy glasses and was super great to chat with! 
I'm sure I'll be back bc I think my mom would love this place. Cute decor on the inside. Quaint, county feel to it :)"}
{"text":"Get the biscuits. You have to. They named the frickin place after them!!! Get them smothered in gravy for more awesomeness. Love the friendly staff   Do not have a bad thing to say about this place."}
{"text":"My friends and I had a group of six come in for the first time. Waitress was nice and quick. Food was ordered and came out quickly. Everything was hot and fresh. The amount of food was fulfilling. Very large portions and tasted very good. 
Our group was very please with soup, burger, melt, sea food and breakfasts. We did spend more than anticipated for a lunch or a breakfast for lunch. But we all agreed the freshness and quantity was worth it. The interior and decor was a bit incomplete, but plenty of room for a lot people. 
If American comfort food is your thing check out Biscuits. Please note the hours of operation."}
{"text":"Not so hot.  This was the absolute worst sausage I have ever been served.  You know that little pan of water they keep things like hamburgers and sausage warm in water, well normally it is put on the grill and given a little brown in the outside before it is served, not at this place.  I order over medium eggs because I do not like runny whites, guess what runny whites yet a dark brown crust on the outside  were served.  So why didn't I send it back?  I never saw the waitress again until she brought the bill, never picked up the plates.  I will not be back  I recommend driving past Biscuits"}
{"text":"The staff was nice and friendly! The food was ok.   The silverware needs to be replaced looks they are over several years old with all the spots on them.  Reasonably priced and enjoyed the military discount."}
{"text":"Wife, daughter and I decided to do brunch. Checked times and distances and drove 15 miles to get there. We got there at 1:40 PM, posted hours are till 2PM.

They had already put out the closed sign. When we questioned them we were told we were welcome to order coffee and hang out till 2:00 but the kitchen was closed.

Ignore their posted hours... they close a 30-45 minutes before they say they do.

Extremely miffed and, tho their food is good, I'm considering other places from now on. There are plenty of good breakfast places around that actually honor their hours."}
{"text":"Big menu, big plates of food.   I had the biscuit special, a regular menu item.  Eggs, biscuit with gravy, choice of meat and choice of potatoes or grits.  I chose bacon and grit.  The grits were really good!

Lots of glass windows so it was a bit warm.  The ceiling fans helped to circulate the air but still a little warm."}
{"text":"The food was pretty tasty. I got my order to go; the cashier was nice but did not move with a sense of urgency and the guy behind me became agitated."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday. Waited 20-30 minutes maybe. Totally worth the wait. I never go out to breakfast because I'm always disappointed but not here! Everything was perfectly cooked. Eggs over medium,crispy hash browns, perfectly hot gravy and yummy biscuits!Five stars!"}
{"text":"Comfort food at it's most comfortable.  I've pretty much go here every weekend for breakfast.  Their chicken fried steaks are well seasoned, tender, and delicious as well as the corned beef hash.  I usually pick between the two and get a side of either a fresh blueberry muffin, which comes out warm and drizzled with brown sugar or a pancake, which is also very tasty.  My only complaint is that I wish the biscuits were bigger."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday afternoon around 1pm.  Looked like the brunch crew had started to clear out, and our party of 2 was seated immediately.

Ordered lunch- BLT (plenty of quality bacon) and the tuna melt (yummy bread).  Standard sandwiches you would expect at a cafe.  Very good!

Would love to come back for breakfast."}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much from the road, but give it a try! Biscuits hits that sweet combo of affordability and quality. We had the biscuits and sausage gravy and the chorizo omelet. Neither was a revelation, but both were very good, very satisfying, and very reasonably priced. 

Their biscuits are hearty, fluffy, and buttery yummery!

Service was also very good. I docked one star because the interior was a bit grungy, but you won't notice once they put those delicious butter pucks in your grill!"}
{"text":"Just had breakfast at Biscuits and loved it.  The waiter John was terrific.  Asked for the country potatoes well done and they came out crispy and hot!  And of course the biscuits were incredible.  I am very glad we came upon it."}
{"text":"Arrived on a packed Sunday morning.  Eclectic, pleasant interior--mix between a barn and a diner.  Told we had a 25-minute wait, but we were seated in 10 minutes.  All waitstaff very pleasant and friendly.  Food arrived quickly--right on the borderline between lukewarm and cold--but we were hungry and they were busy so we didn't send it back.  Their famous biscuits were exactly like the food-service items we had in the Army--pre-crafted from processed dough on their own tray and only required the cooks to put them in the oven for 15 minutes.  Sausage gravy was store-bought and tasted like congealed fat mixed with cornstarch.  Ordered the Meat Lover's plate with grits and eggs over-medium.  Eggs came over-easy, grits were salty.  The Portuguese sausage was tasty--but they only gave me 5 1-inch diameter ovals of meat.  The ham measured 3\" x 4\" (if that) and was cold.  Needless to say, I was still hungry and this sparse plate cost around $10.  My wife liked her Eggs Benedict and country potatoes.  We split a Champion Pancake order.  Almost $10 for 2--but I think it was worth it.  Whole wheat cakes loaded with granola and fresh fruit items.  The best thing we had for breakfast--and, I think, the only thing that was freshly-prepared.  15% Military discount brought final tally to $35 before tip.  I was really not a big fan, but my wife said it was worth it for the pancakes.  Not sure if we'll be back."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Biscuits and Gravy I've ever had from a restaurant! Place is clean and staff is extremely friendly. However, I can only give 3 starts because beyond their Biscuit Entrees, their food is average Cafe/Diner fare. Their biscuits are what keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like Biscuits, I really did. The service has always been good, and the staff are very personable.

After three visits I will say the food is quite flavorful, but very carb and fat heavy!

But my biggest issue is that utensils and dishes were not clean two of my three visits! I don't mind getting an occasional dirty spoon or something, but this was way too consistent for me. And it makes me wonder how clean and sanitary their overall dishwashing - and even the kitchen - would be."}
{"text":"I went to Biscuits on a Friday night for dinner. Their menu featured \"Fish Fry Friday\" consisting of mostly fish and a few shrimp dishes. I ordered the fish sandwich with clam chowder soup. It tasted decent, but nothing too spectacular. It was what you would expect at a typical restaurant.

The wait staff was very friendly and chatted us up throughout the dinner, and they refilled my water as quickly a I drank it.

Overall a pleasant experience at a local eatery."}
{"text":"We found this place using Yelp of course. Have never had much luck in this part of Phoenix with breakfast, so happy we found Biscuit. 
We arrived to find they have a huge parking lot, and it was full! Got inside to be told it would be 30 minutes, but actually only took 10. 
I ordered their Biscuit plate special, with grits. It was great, fantastic gravy, great bacon and perfect grits.
Wifey ordered the South Mountain plate, scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy. She loved it. We shared a single pancake and it was awesome. Will return and recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place!

The inside is just so cute, it has a barn/country theme. I love the little caddys they have on the tables that hold your tabasco sauce, sugar, salt, pepper,etc.  Food is delicious! They add onions to your potatoes which i really love and i like how they add a biscuit as a side with your omelet. Pancakes are very fluffy! The service is as good as it gets! Been here maybe 4 times and have been blown away each time. I HIGHLY recommend Biscuits!"}
{"text":"Disappointed.

Went here on July 3rd and should have made a note that the breakfast places that I was driving by had waiting lines in front but this restaurant did not. I had read some prior reviews that this was a great place to have breakfast and I had been meaning to try it out so me and my friend decided to spend our day off breakfast at this place. I ordered the SOS and she ordered the Chorizo Scrambler (ever the Mexican patron...)  The portions were of decent size, the hashbrowns were crispy, but my SOS tasted like it was made with a full container of Morton's Salt and my eggs were way under cooked from how I ordered them. My friends chorizo was ok but the tortillas were the quality of store bought- fresh would have mad a big difference. Maybe we ordered the wrong things...? 

I can say the service was good, our server knew the menu well and came to check on us several times to fill our drinks. 

I realize I could have complained and sent the food back but I come from the restaurant industry and I just hate to complain. I know that I won't choose this place again when there are much better diners to spend my money at which aren't so mediocre."}
{"text":"Typically we stop into Biscuits once a year, but ended up in here for breakfast twice in the last week. On Saturday they were packed, but it did not take that long to be seated. Once seated we were served drinks and had our order taken within minutes - chicken fried steak and omlette. Both were very good. Eggs Benedict on the second visit. Excellent food and service! No wait at all during the week"}
{"text":"The grits...oh my word! Best I've ever had and that's saying something as I grew up in Texas and lived 20 years in the \"south\" (Florida).  Very friendly and attentive service.  Fair prices.  The gravy, for the biscuits and gravy, tastes exactly like a mix I use when I'm in a rush and do not make my own from scratch.  The iced tea tastes like a powdered mix and not fresh brewed.  All in all though, this is a really solid breakfast place that I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I was quite surprised....Friday Night Fish Fry=Yummy. Huge portions of freshly made fish that just melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"The hubby heard about this place from coworkers so we decided to give it a try one weekend.  Biscuits is your typical breakfast establishment but if you're looking for something to exceed your expectations, you must try the biscuits and gravy.  So delicious! The biscuits were light so they don't leave you with that heavy feeling in your stomach that you would expect and the gravy is seasoned perfectly.  If you order the South Mountain, it comes with potatoes that are cooked to perfection...crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The service was fast and extremely friendly and welcoming.  This is the place to visit if you love biscuits and gravy or just have a craving once in awhile."}
{"text":"Coming from Chicago to Phoenix and not knowing a great breakfast spot, we found it at Biscuits! We don't like all of the chain action in Phoenix, but understand it to be the norm....

I had the french toast combo with turkey sausage. Fantastic french toast, sausage and eggs. I thought the food was great and the service. The coffee was delicious. Some people don't dig the country asthetics but I thought the food was awesome. My gf had the biscuits and gravy special and was not disappointed! 

Everything was great and delicious. Service was great!"}
{"text":"This place has the Best breakfast food in the Valley for the price! Clean, good portions, great service and The FOOD!!! Fresh Brewed Iced Tea, Biscuits that are indescribable (in a good way) and pancakes were awesome. It's a bit of a drive for us, but we'll make this trip often!!"}
{"text":"Best Breakfast in Arizona, Please don't share this information with anyone. it's already hard to get a seat here.... Pancakes are magical as they didn't get soggy in the middle.....I go to the one in Gilbert and have not been to the other locations...."}
{"text":"First timer here and it was boooooomb haha !! Good service, fast service and good music. Pancakes are huge and fluffy. The Egg Benedict was delicious !!"}
{"text":"Waiter seemed a little rush, but was nice enough. He brought me a carafe of ice water, which I appreciated. My omelette was perfect. Eggs were fluffy and cooked through but not overcooked either. Biscuit was amazing. Country potatoes were great. Place was clean, and I enjoyed my meal. I'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"I've lived in Ahwatukee for 5 years and finally got around to visiting Biscuits.  I'm glad I did.  The portions are ample, the service was fast, the food is tasty, and the prices are reasonable. 

The pancakes stood out for me the most.  The biscuits (naturally) are delicious and the gravy was also delicious.  

This is a very good stop for breakfast and I look forward to coming back after a long hike once the weather cools off!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I ate there for the first time today. He had the biscuit and gravy and I had an omelet. Shortly after we got our food a man started mopping the floors (they were closing early today.) The floor cleaner was so strong it actually made me very sick. I got 1/4 the way through my meal and I had to get up and go to the bathroom to vomit. I understand you want to get out of there on time but if you see someone eating their food you should not be using such harsh cleaners. I have never had that experience in a restaurant before. I was very disappointed in this restaurant because the food and service was great."}
{"text":"We've been to this restaurant two times in the past month for some good homemade breakfast. We enjoy supporting local, family-owned businesses. The staff here is some of the friendliest around. From the host/hostess to waitresses and cashiers, always the nicest people. Our favorite dish is the traditional eggs Benedict. You can tell it's made fresh in house. And, as the name implies, their biscuits are delicious! This place is super small though, and a local favorite, so it gets busy quick! We will certainly be returning often."}
{"text":"We are pretty new to Gilbert so when we drive and see a little breakfast spot that isn't a chain we jump on that idea. We walk in & it has cute farm type decor, but lots of bare wall space. We sit to look over the menu & seem to all (myself, husband & 7 yr old) find something we would like to try. I'm the picky one of the bunch & don't eat eggs. So any special/combo that comes with eggs I ask for a side of fruit. Well they didn't offer that, I was only allowed to get double hash browns or double country potatoes. So that was our 1st bummer. 2nd was that when I cut into & ate my biscuits & gravy it was so plain & hard. The outside of the biscuit was hard as a rock. The gravy had zero flavor. My husband said the chicken fried steak was good & my 7 yr old enjoyed her French toast. But the kids & seniors eat off the same menu which meant there was a lot of food left over seeing as most kids won't come close to eating an adult portion. Prices were wayyyyyy to high for what you got, especially the side of bacon. To get our check took 15min due to the waitress being continuously sat patrons when she wasn't even able to serve the tables she already had. We gave her our CC & she said \"oh there's a huge line at the register it may take a while\" yet when she dropped the bill off she said to cash out with her. We were confused on what to do. So we waited & waited & 20min later we got our card back & left. We unfortunately won't be back."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of great diner food back in New York. The quality and consistency of the food is second to none. It's not pretentious just delicious. They are all about breakfast for the most part but the lunch menu has some great stuff. Have a Chicken Fried Chicken for breakfast. It's a great excuse to eat the gravy."}
{"text":"Wow, my first time I walked in the place and the new girl that answer the phone and took my order just messed up my whole Friday, took my order over the phone and asked me did I want my sandwich on a biscuit  then argue with me after because she has got it wrong, then want to charge me for it and didn't want to give my money back, the manager wanted me to wait 15 more minutes for they mess up? She apologized gave me my money back and her excuse was forgive the new girl cause she new. Left hungry and disappointed, maybe I will be back when the new girl gone cause she was real rude, even sat a couple down that came into the place after a handicap man standing First in front of the counter, sad. 5/18/18, 10:10am"}
{"text":"Okay, besides there being an occasional wait -weekends/breakfast/holiday, this place is consistent.  Wait typically isn't too long, hostess is quick to recognize new guests, customers are called several times until located and the promptly seated.  Waitresses are usually quick to approach table for beverage order and if not, the busboys serve as efficient backups and assist with getting the table started.

Coke products at this location.  Did I mention that yet?  And the waitresses are good about making sure you have something in you glass/cup to drink.

Biscuits are good. 
Sausage links, no patties here, are okay if you like that stuff.
I'm used to Bob Evans or Jimmy Dean sausage so most restaurant sausage doesn't taste good to me.
Bacon, crispy CRISPY.  I like mine on the rare and wiggly side so no bacon for me.
Ham is okay.
The Polish sausage is on the greasy side but has good flavor.  
Chicken fried steak is hearty, crisp, and smothered well with gravy which compliments it nicely.
Potatoes are the shredded hash browns or the cubed type which I think are the O'Briens or country fries.
Grits are buttered but I think they're yummy.

Nothing like grits, biscuits and gravy, and  chicken fried steak to make you feel that your were born and raised in the South.
In this case, living close to South Mountain.  

One last thing.
They have a fish fry on Fridays so they're open for dinner."}
{"text":"Busy location.  Truth here, both locations seem to maintain a steady flow. 
Service has been fair to mediocre, food from kitchen is fairly consistent but on this occasion the eggs undercooked, gravy had way too much black pepper, biscuit was hard (but hubby switched with me), and the grits that was part of the order arrived late (it happens) and contained an excessive amount of butter/margarine or salt.
They do have Coke products again.  Hurray!  Seems they brought in Pepsi and we opted to not dine at this location because we have a preference for Coke.  As long as I'm still drinking soda, it'll be Coke products.
I think this location has less seating than the Biscuits in Ahwatukee but the wait seems to be about the same.
I like the hominess of the place (environment, service -most days, menu options, hours of operation) overall and rather be a little forgiving of less than desirable preparation."}
{"text":"Exactly what Ahwatukee needed. Great food and service every time I visit. The chicken fried steak and eggs with sausage gravy that barely fits on the plate is a favorite of mine for breakfast. The club and patty melt for lunch are both very good choices. The french fries are not the greatest but the onion rings are awesome!!"}
{"text":"This was the worst service I have ever experienced we seat  down maybe 4 tables had people seated took order fast got drinks than sat and watched the resterant fill and each 4 or 5 tables that came in after us get their food was their for almost an hour wasn't noticed until we got up to leave then a worker said bye have nice day then realized we where not paying and then saw we never got are food and told us are food was coming out next ! Never eat here!! This is my first time doing this usually I just don't go back but this really pissed me off!!!"}
{"text":"Biscuits and gravy special is a very close second to the best I've ever had for breakfast.  Grandma's favorite meal came before my eyes when I  experienced this new breakfast and lunch restaurant in Gilbert.  We will return and invite our friends, too."}
{"text":"Cute little establishment, just ate the best Eggs Benedict ever with homemade hollandaise sauce!!! 5 stars!!!  My partner had the chorizo and it was delicious."}
{"text":"I have wanted to eat at this spot for awhile... I ended up going for lunch entered this spot and we were seated right away and I looked over the menu so many options... But I came for the spam I had not eaten it for years... I ordered the WWll Spam and Eggs - A thick slice of crispy Spam (pork shoulder and ham?) with two eggs any style and a side of country gravy. I rate the experience as followed...

Spam - B+
Eggs - B+
County Gravy - B+
Staff - B+
County Potatoes - B

I really enjoyed the meal it was a lot of food... I ate it all I will be back for sure lots on the menu I want to try."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast while staying in the east valley for the weekend. I haven't  been here in a couple of years and it has not changed! It is still excellent! We arrived at a very busy time and only waited 10 minutes, were seated and met my our server , ordered our drinks and was quickly served.  The food was delicious,  I had the French toast breakfast it was perfect! Nice and crispy on the outside, my eggs were over medium and cooked perfectly, which seems now a days is a rarity.  My girl had the biscuits and gravy and she said they were phenomenal.  I will come here again soon, even though it's an hour drive from home. Highly recommend this place, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Great small town feel like grandmas cooking. I love the biscuits and gravy, like they say \"it's in the name!\" Friendly and fast service but not rushed out."}
{"text":"It used to be a Chevy's Bar and grill about 9 yrs ago. The building is almost 30 years old with interior to match. This breakfast and brunch spot is more suited for an older clientele which surrounds it. 
We took my father in law to brunch and he was satisfied. The chicken fried steak my wife had seemed uncooked in the middle. The potatoes tasted like they came out of a bag. My Denver omelette was small even though I added a half a dozen more ingredients to it. My tomato slices which I subbed in for bread were fresh and tasty.  
On a positive note, the service was excellent.  
I would only return at the request of my father in law who enjoys this resturaunt."}
{"text":"Great food as always. Was happy to arrive @ 10:30am on a Sunday and not have a huge wait. Service was top notch. My only reason for not giving 5 stars was the misleading menu. Claims to offer 10% off meals for vets and I was dining with 2 but they only gave $1.00 off per vet and their meals were more than $10.00 each."}
{"text":"This is the first and last time i will eat here.
My order came out wrong. I ordered chicken fried steak, hash browns, and eggs scrambled soft.
When i got my food, i had a huge, nearly carbonized steak fritter, smothered in what tasted like whataburger country gravy, a small bowl of grits(not touchin that), a scrambled egg patty thing cooked well enough to cut with a knife, and the clincher, a wierd mottled crispy on the outside, soggy on the inside biscuit. Now. If your gonna call your place \"biscuits\", you should at least try to nail the biscuit.
Anyway if your in this neighborhood, and you want breakfast, id advise going half a mile west on elliot to crackers & co cafe. Theyre doing the same thing, but they are actually pulling it off."}
{"text":"My family and I come here at least three times a month. The restaurant is always clean, staff are all funny and friendly. We've had a little bit of everything food wise and yes the biscuits are amazing! The food is consistently fresh, seasoned well, and cooked to your preference. My favorites are; pancakes, steak and eggs, biscuits and gravy, pigs in a blanket, and the bacon egg biscuit sandwich. The waitresses are all on point with making sure you have refills of your drinks and anything else you may need when dining here. If you're a late riser just a heads up from 9-10am it's kinda crazy around here so expect a wait. Otherwise to get in and out we try to make it here before 830am. I have nothing to complain about. We love this place!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast in town!!  I am usually reluctant to order eggs any style other than scrambled because its never cooked right...for some reason I decided to change it up and ordered over medium and im glad i did! They were perfect! The biscuits were light and fluffy aas were the pancakes...everyone loved and shared their meal.  Good homestyle cooking! They dont skimp out on the portions. You wont be disappointed....prices are decent too."}
{"text":"We've only been here a few times and only on Friday nights when our kids are in karate.  Our little mini-date night.  John has been our server and he is absolutely fantastic and funny.  We love him.

We love their fish fry stuff with fried okra, catfish, cod, fries.  The stuff is fried just great because it doesn't taste greasy.  it's a lot of food and we always take home a bunch of food.

We'll have to bring our kids here and try their breakfasts and lunches.  They also have a Biscuits right by our church in Tempe, but no John there.  He is the best part because he makes dining there so great!"}
{"text":"Biscuits? Their biscuits taste frozen and their potatoes taste horrible as if they've been sitting back there for an hour yuck"}
{"text":"Great locally owned restaurant! GREAT food for BOTH breakfast and lunch. Friendly staff, but it's a lil pricey for a local Cafe but I still come here, because the food's SO good!"}
{"text":"Ever see back to the future? Well this place was something like that....straight out of the 1960's and probably the using the same booths. We came to Biscuits because my mom swore it was the best breakfast place around...sadly, I disagree. It felt old as soon as we walked in...ripped booths, dirty floors, tired and disinterested staff....actually, I should mention it started in the parking lot- where we were greeted by 3 kitchen employees smoking and leaning on a car (most likely before cooking our breakfast) no one smiled, there was only a handful of other tables...none under the age of 80- and the food was okay. Breakfast is hard- only three ways it can go, amazing, average or terrible. This was average at best. Nothing to brag about and nothing to bring me back. Eggs are eggs- service, decor and a unique menu is what sets the good ones apart from the rest. When in AZ I doubt I would ever return to Biscuits, too many other choices with a lot more to offer."}
{"text":"Today we decided to go to Biscuits! It was a positive experience.Our server was Melissa and had a great attitude.She was very efficient and kind. The surroundings were fine, very clean.But when we got our take out cups one of the lids dropped and our server picked it up and put it back on the table. The food itself was delicious but one pair of the eggs came out differently than what we wanted.This place is recommended if you're looking for somewhere casual and nice to eat. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Second visit. Consistently Clean , good service.
Great Huevos Rancheros, fluffy pancakes .
Lunch had the Reuben it was fantastic! Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Definitely amazing homemade breakfast! I had to come back for a 2nd time to pinch myself and see if it was too good to be true. You can tell that everything is made from scratch. Love love love the meat lovers plate. I've gotten different renditions of it both times I've come. The Portugese sausage is fantastic as are the biscuits and gravy and blueberry granola pancakes tgat are one of a kind. Oh, don't sleep on their grits that are the bomb!"}
{"text":"Honestly I'm torn. One of my eggs was over cooked, hollandaise was kind of bland, steak was a very poor cut, and pancakes were mediocre at best. HOWEVER the potatoes were amazing! (Both hash browns & homefries) The flavor they got into that sad little steak was impressive, and the biscuits were great. In the end huge wait for inconsistent food. Might be back might not."}
{"text":"I really loved the food and service. I want to go back to try the Cuban!! The Breakfast on the Sunday morning I was there was excellent."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the country farm house decor. Reminds me too much of The Good Egg, and if you're a new restaurant....decorate different. Service was great.

I had the breakfast quesadilla which I had never seen on any breakfast menu before. Pleasantly surprised, it was great! 

Friend had biscuits and gravy, and daughter had the mickey mouse pancake which is much bigger than IHOP's which usually leaves her still hungry.

Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great food.....service and reasonable prices.   Best eggs Benedict I've had !!!!  Eat breakfast at least once a week here.  The biscuits and gravy are truly Southern"}
{"text":"Average quality food. The biscuits are large, and are more of the airy, bread-like type of biscuit rather than buttery and flaky. The gravy was unremarkable, with small crumbles of sausage in it. I also had country potatoes with my meal, which were heavily slathered with whatever buttery-oil concoction they use on the grill. 

I ordered poached eggs with my meal, but unfortunately the cook left half an eggshell in my egg so when I bit into it there was an unpleasant crunch. The waitress and hostess(?)/manager(?) were very apologetic about it and said they would make sure the kitchen knew about it.

Overall, service is good, but the breakfast didn't particularly wow me."}
{"text":"First review! I think this place is destined for
good things... To start: the service was swift and friendly and I was sat almost immediately on arrival. The place was 1/4 full so I can imagine service would be quick. My server was nice and another server helped (which I like because team work means I get fed fast!) The restaurant was clean and aesthetically pleasing.  I chose the more traditional biscuits and gravy breakfast in light of the restaurant name. The food was above average, everything was hot, seemingly freshly prepared, and exact to my order. Small things like having a different hot sauce(other than Tabasco) and whipped butter for my \"champion\" pancake(delicious btw) made the experience above par. All in all I recommend. I would give it 4.5 stars if that was an option. .5 off was because the price was a bit on the high side ( I ordered a single champion pancake a la carte, it was 6.89... that's a bit rediculous) good job biscuits!"}
{"text":"Omg. Found this place in a rush before work and it was totally worth it. I got the biscuit special and my boyfriend got the hamburger steak. Both were so good and the prices are very good. The biscuits  were so fluffy and flavorful. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place was not anything special.  The ambience was cheap and old dingy.. The waitress wa nice.. Our food was served suspiciously fast.  The coffee was bland.  I would  not rush back here unless I'm drunk and hung over."}
{"text":"Oh biscuits... biscuits... you purveyor of breakfast goodness!!!!

How spoiled we are in the Valley with so many great breakfast options. A place in these parts needs a little sumthin to shine through and draw a crowd, and Biscuits definitely has something special.

Came here with the lady and we ordered up a few platefuls of treats. Meat platter, biscuits 'n gravy (because... WORD!) and the champion pancakes. 

Their selection of meats is really truly nice. It's not just flappy bacon, greasy sausage, and gray lifeless patties. Oh no. Several selections of chorizo, sausages, and genuinely good options. That's nice to have, in a breakfast joint.

The biscuits were really good. I'd say that they weren't exceptional, though... but good enough to be ordered again. I guess I just had higher expectations for them based on all the other dishes, but they were definitely good. Just not *AMAZEBALLS* good.

Now... the champion pancakes... good GOOGLYMOOGLY!!!! Them shits was the Brit's tits (copyright). I can't even remember all the things they threw into this, but good lord it was amazing. Some oatmeal, some berries, some nuts... it truly was a pancake for a champion... I just felt like a really FULL champion.

We have a lot of options out here for breakfast, and Biscuits definitely brings something special to the plate!"}
{"text":"OMG!!! The Chiquita Style French Toast with Nutella and banana is AMAZING!!! I have a super sweet tooth, and this dish really hit the spot! I also appreciate the 15% military discount. I will definitely be back, and maybe try a savory dish next time."}
{"text":"We ordered here for lunch today with our office. The food was amazing. The people were nice as can be. We ordered the fish and chips, taco salad, and AZ Chicken salad. The portions are big and the food was fresh and so tasty. We found a new place!!! YUMMMMMMYY"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've not written a review for this wonderful little gem previously.  We've frequented Biscuits for a couple of years now and have had very positive experiences. The team that works there is awesome!  They are friendly, caring, all around good people.  The food is always good and today was no exception.  The biscuits - as one would expect - are exceptional and my standard meal, the Denver omelet is fantastic!  Oh...and I love a place that doesn't try to cram our family of five into a booth with a chair on the end!  They have spacious tables here!"}
{"text":"We are so impressed with this location!  It's relatively new; it's clean; it's nicely decorated; and it's filled with a friendly team that took good care of us while we were there.  The food is good and there's a nice variety of options so everyone in the family is happy, even the kids.  I think we'll be frequenting this location from now on.  Sorry Ahwatukee and Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Great staff, everyone seems very friendly. Seems like the owner is very involved and they have an a lot of repeat customers. Been here a few times and always been happy"}
{"text":"Best breakfast around.
Bacon nice and thick.
Biscuts and gravy right on the money
Oatmeal with all the fixing and a side of blueberries  makes a meal in its self.
Staff are well season and get down to business with your order, like dining at a 5 star resturant. 
Look forward to going there for lunch."}
{"text":"This is our regular breakfast place.  We love it here.  We've always had great service, the food is excellent, and it is all done efficiently!  The decor is very cute and restaurant is always clean. Yes there have been busier mornings, but our servers have always been attentive and friendly.  I love supporting local restaurants!"}
{"text":"Went here cause a friend said was so great. After waiting over an hour to be saeted it wasn't worth the wait. It was just OK."}
{"text":"This place is great! As I work in the area, my boss and I often eat here or take food out. Both Erin and Luis are always great. They always take great care of us. The food is delicious and there is never a complaint. They know when they have lunch rush and are always very well staffed. If you are a fan of grilled chicken, order the chicken dinner plate that comes with grilled veggies, mashed potatoes, and gravy. I will definitely keep coming back"}
{"text":"Great breakfast food! We're on vacation and if we lived out here we'd be regulars. Super friendly staff and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"I've driven by \"Biscuits\" a million times and I finally was able to come in. Boy am I glad, I did. You seat yourself (which is perfect) the moment my butt hit I was greeted. Less than two mins later I placed my order (French toast, cheese eggs, bacon and grits) less than three mins my food was in my face. The waitress made me feel like I was home (P-Cola,Fl.) she gave me some history on how she's the one who makes the grits :). Next time your looking for a nice, clean, cozy, friendly place to eat; try Biscuits. I soooo sound like a commercial LOL... Will, I be back? You bet ya!"}
{"text":"I like it cause the food is really hot yo... 3 stars because the food is pricey.."}
{"text":"The fish fry here is simply amazing. I love the combination platter, it's pure value and the fried clams are to die for. I have to limit how often I come here on Friday nights or id end up with a giant hole in my pocket."}
{"text":"Great waitress my son loved the biscuits and gravy . Coffee was average. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Overall ok.  The breakfast is good but there aren't many options.  The Friday fish fry is really good though!!! The servers are friendly but don't really seem too professional.  We go a lot, and occasionally we hear a bunch of clatter from the kitchen, but it just adds to the cozy feel.  It might need a little cleaning, but overall it's a good place for when you want a fast, cheap, and tasty meal."}
{"text":"This place is great! Went on a Sunday morning and waited 20-25 minutes. Staff did not seem behind and neither did the food, it was just poppin. The staff was so accommodating with us as a family. It was my wife, a 20 month old, a 3 week old , and myself. Definitely a task going out to eat, so we do not do it much. Food came out astronomically fast, which you expect with breakfast foods. I was concerned about their prices until I tasted the food. I am always advocating for fresh ingredients, and this place has them. I don't mind paying higher prices if I get my bacon and it is 85% meat and 15 % fat. Most breakfast places you get the reciprocal of that. I had to try the biscuits and gravy and I am so glad I did! They must bake the biscuits on top of butter, because they had a great flaky crunch when I would cut into them with my fork. Even though they were lathered in delicious gravy, the biscuits were still crunchy on the last bite. I could have licked the plate clean, but they give you a nice big portion which makes that a task. When it comes to breakfast, I don't want to go anywhere else now."}
{"text":"My favorite place for \"Skits n' Gravy\"
Everyone here is so kind and always smiling. I'm also a fan a restaurant that opens early like Biscuits."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE the chicken fried steak and the biscuits and gravy are fabulous. My son doesn't like breakfast so he got the pulled pork sandwich and fries. He thought it was really good. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. The service is also very pleasant."}
{"text":"I had brunch on a Sunday and despite how busy it was, our service was speedy and admirable. Now to the food! I ordered the traditional breakfast. Let me tell ya, get the biscuit and country potatoes! That biscuit was sooo fluffy and NOT dry, those potatoes were perfectly crisp on the outside soft on the outside packed with flavor. I'm not the biggest fan of breakfast joints but dang I was surprised by this place. Give it a whirl!"}
{"text":"I work at the big o tires next door to this place so my co workers and I get breakfast from here all the time. This place place hands down has the best breakfast. And what makes it more better is the people that work there.. Erin and Luis are such sweet people. Always have a smile on their face. It feels so welcoming when you walk in. Any time my guests come in for service at my shop I always send them here!"}
{"text":"The food overall was pretty good. The bacon was perfect. The eggs were good and the gravy was delicious. The only thing I was disappointed about was the biscuits not being soft and fluffy they actually had a crunch to them on the outside. For a place to be called biscuits and have the biscuits sub par just doesn't make sense. It is my first visit so I will see if they just over cooked them or if this was the norm on my next visit."}
{"text":"I've tried their breakfast and was happy with what I had.

I ordered the Portuguese sausage breakfast.  I grew up on this sausage, Linguica, in the Bay Area so I'm used to some good stuff.  This was okay, I didn't get a lot, but enough I suppose.  Eggs were good as well as the hashbrowns.

We ordered a pancake, yes, A, one, for the table and it was very good.  They use REAL butter here, it makes me so happy.

Breakfast was good enough for me to come back and try lunch soon.  I'll re-post after."}
{"text":"Amazing!!  The husband and I went here for a late breakfast one sunday and the food was amazing!  They were busy, but kept pace very well.  I got the biscuits and gravy which I fancy myself a connoisseur of and they were incredible.  I also had a pancake which was great, but was too full from the biscuits.

Lisa was our waitress and she was a doll.  Quick and friendly, we never wanted for anything."}
{"text":"My wife and I love going out to breakfast and we have seemingly sampled most of the breakfast and lunch joints within a ten mile drive from our South Tempe home.  Biscuits continues to rank right up there with the best.   If you are looking for an old fashioned restaurant to eat breakfast or lunch this is the place for you.  Lots of traditional American comfort food (including liver and onions which is a family favorite).  Service is prompt and the food has never disappointed.  Prices are reasonable and the portions are satisfying.  We have yet to get to their Friday fish fry but that is on the to-do list."}
{"text":"Really busy on the weekends. Food is ok. Service was really quick and friendly. Probably nicer if you go on off peak hours."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. Love the grits and scrambled eggs. A great neighborhood place to frequent for breakfast. Good service and there's always a table available."}
{"text":"The biscuits were absolutely amazing and quite filling. Shared an order of pancakes, which were slightly sweet and perfectly cooked on the griddle. The portions were huge and everything was amazing, definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"I had the steak and eggs with country potatoes. The eggs were good, the steak was too fatty and with little taste, the country potatoes were undercooked and still hard. I also had the biscuits and gravy and they were delicious. My girlfriend had the eggs benedict and she enjoyed them saying they were very good. I come to AZ once a year for spring training and I dont think I will be back here."}
{"text":"Two words. LIGHTS OUT.

As a family of foodies, we eat all over the US and especially like local family owned home style restaurants (which are getting harder to find) and this place does not disappoint. The SOS gravy is solid, the chicken fried steak is fresh and the fried clam strips are bomb. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite breakfast place now.  GREAT friendly service and quick!  The best breakfast I've had in a long time.  My two kids got delicious buttermilk Mickey Mouse pancakes with two thick-cut pieces of maple bacon.  My wife got a 'champion pancake' - a  wheat pancake with granola, cinnamon and blueberries. I got biscuits & gravy, eggs, bacon and hashbrowns.  ALL were absolutely perfect and incredibly flavorful. All this (including OJ & choc. Milk for the kids) for only $38-we couldn't finish all the portion.  Their homemade biscuits are to die for-don't leave without trying one.  We can't wait to go back!

P.S. Their waitress Julie is as good as it gets--the owners are blessed to have her."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food, huge portions,  and great service.   Biscuits and gravy made me sick.  Not because of restaurant.  Certain oils in foods do this to me.  Husband got Corned Beef and Hash entree.  He loved it and eaten quickly.  Good sweet tea too."}
{"text":"Old school diner with old school friendly service.  Great biscuits and sausage gravy with a ton of sausage in the gravy, the corned beef hash is mostly corned beef-not potatoes as other people corned beef hash is.  As I said, super friendly staff with great service. Military discount also."}
{"text":"Yummy . I came to have lunch with my parents . 

They highly recommended this restaurant. So I took my lunch break and it was Delicious  

I got the meatloaf with potatoes and gravy and the veggies were so good  

Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"On the way to The Farmhouse in Gilbert a couple of weeks ago, we stumbled onto Biscuits.  Being from the South, I'm always down for biscuits and gravy, so we decided to check out this cute, barn-themed restaurant.  It was a little to shiny to actually exist on a farm, but welcoming, none the less.  
The restaurant is very clean and open and the service was friendly.  We were sat immediately and received drink orders before we could decide on anything from the delicious looking menu.  There were definitely some good ol' southern favorites, like grits and corned beef hash, but there were also a few chorizo options and a Portuguese sausage that my boyfriend ordered.  
I went for the corned beef hash, scrambled eggs, hash browns and added sausage gravy to my biscuit. Make sure you go hungry!  I couldn't even dream of finishing everything I ordered, but I made sure to it all.  Crispy hash browns, fluffy eggs, and big chunks of corned beef mixed with potatoes, peppers and onions.  The sausage gravy was perfectly thick, but could possibly have used a bit more sausage (what can I say, I'm a meat lover!).  The only thing that brings it down to 4 stars was the biscuit.  It was definitely good, but more bready than flaky.  More like a stirred mix than an kneaded dough with the goodness of flaky layers.  And, being their namesake, I do think that part is pretty important.  
We were plenty stuffed and we'll definitely go back because there aren't many places with corned beef hash that didn't come out of a can.  Also, they have good service, which is hard to come by. 
On another note, they offer a military discount to any active or inactive duty military, which is wonderful to see because it's just something small that companies can do to give thanks to people who willingly put their lives on the line every day.  I can support that."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness yes ! The Fruit and yogurt plate had so much variety and the biscuits and gravy were so good. Exceeded our expectations in all categories :)"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and it has been a good experince. Nice staff and some huge plates. Ordered the Country Fried Steak breakfast it was good. I have to say most of the food coming out and i have seen looks and taste good here. Nice spot for family and grab a movie right behind them at this location."}
{"text":"First time here and we beat the rush by arriving before 11am. Service was prompt and refills came when needed. I had the Eggs Benedict with country potatoes and loved every bite. The potatoes had good flavor, the hollandaise was tasty, and the egg was poached exactly as I'd like it (not super runny or undercooked yolk). 

My wife had the signature biscuits and gravy and thought it was fine, but not her favorite. She had entree envy! 

Oh and the coffee was very basic, watery, and bitter, I wouldn't recommend it. There is a lot of good coffee in the valley, I wish they were taking advantage of that. Soda for me, which is fine, but worth mentioning. 

I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"My quick summary:  A really yummy place to eat, but please make reservations.

My fiance and I gathered both our families here for a Sunday brunch to make sure we had all our wedding details finalized.  We knew we'd have a large party and didn't want to wait, so we made reservations.  What a great idea that turned out to be.  This places is PACKED on Sundays.  People walked in, took a look at the crowd, and walked out.  I felt bad for the crowd waiting as they don't have a lot of benches, etc, to sit down on.  Some bales of hay, with blankets thrown over them.  Not my cup of tea, but I know they're trying to stick with the country theme.

We were all seated fairly promptly.  The waitress came by immediately to get our drink orders, but informed us they hadn't gotten their soda delivery so Coke & Diet Coke were not an option (tear).

Our food came fairly quickly.  I had a house omelet with green chilies, chorizo, and a mixture of cheeses.  The omelet was good, but very chorizo heavy.  I found myself search for other flavors.  The hash browns were also crispy and yummy.  Several people at the table ordered their biscuits and gravy & said it was ridiculously delicious.  The kids with us had some of the biggest pancakes I've ever seen.

Overall the service and food was very good.  I'll have no problem going back in the near future."}
{"text":"First time here, and the food was great, everything was delicious. I was going post a picture.... But it was to late."}
{"text":"We had a late breakfast here on a weekday.  Everybody was so friendly, great service and the food was excellent.  I can't say enough about the Eggs Benedict.  The sauce was extra buttery and lemony the way it should be.  And oh my gosh, THE PANCAKES were amazing!!!!  I asked our waitress to bring whipped cream to put on top and wow, not a crumb was left on my plate.  Interestingly, I didn't feel the biscuits and gravy were anything above average, though they were very fresh and true to form.  I must mention that the hash browns were the most perfectly cooked I've ever had in my life, not too soft and not burnt too crispy, they were just right.    

We also ordered take out for dinner and this was a very good idea.    We had Chicken-A-La-King and Meatloaf that evening at home.  Both were very homemade tasting and delicious. Best meal I never cooked.   Please be aware that Biscuits is only open until 2 p.m.  

This is a very cute and comfortable place, decorated like a farm house and comes highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time here. I came here 4 years ago for the first time and the food, service and price was just as good as it was now and it was then. Today's visit for breakfast  I had the chicken fried chicken which is like a chicken fried steak but chicken. It was very delicious. If you're looking for a filling breakfast this dish won't fail you. It does get a bit busy so you may have to wait a few minutes to be seated at a table. But trust me it is worth it. 2 thumbs up in my opinio"}
{"text":"Pancakes and biscuits are a commodity to be found in many places. At Biscuits you're getting good food, made fresh and with an extra helping if friendly service and a warm smile, too. Imagine, someone actually smiling while they look you in the eye. Is it 1981? My wife, nicknamed \"Cheekiebaby, tried their biscuits and corn beef hash and she said, \"it was definitely made from scratch and it isn't greasy.\" I had the breakfast sandwich which hit the spot.  So much so it kept me silent for several minutes while I ate. I also ordered a pancake to go along. Hey, don't criticize, I'm writing reviews as a public service! Moving forward, the pancake was delicious. It came with warm syrup and creamy butter. One thing I noted is that the pancake is dense. That's okay with me, but it'll fill you up. For those wanting pancakes to mirror their fashionable cousin the crepe, you may want to have just one pancake or choose something else. Biscuit's pancakes ain't nothing to be messed with. Much like the no nonsense, quasi Midwestern feel I get from the restaurant's decor, these pancakes are will get the best of you if you're not ready for some serious eats. I'm looking forward to exploring the menu on other occasions and maybe next time I'll come ready for two pancakes."}
{"text":"As a third generation hillbilly once removed, I am always on the look out for good biscuits and gravy. Not dry heavy bread balls with bacon fat, but real b&g. Slap my Grandma and kiss my grits if these aren't the best you've ever had! The biscuits are light and fluffy and the sausage gravy is perfect. You won't be sorry but you may need to lie down after you eat."}
{"text":"Came in for a good breakfast but that didn't happen. My husband ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs. While eating the steak he found a big piece of plastic. It wasn't small it was big piece,we then  informed the staff who were shocked. They took the plate away and asked my husband what else he wanted but after seeing that we just didn't want anything else. It ruined our whole breakfast that day. They took the the steak off our bill but I don't think we will eat here again."}
{"text":"Local favorite!  These folks care about their customers and their food.  Good old fashion breakfast.  I've only had breakfast, but i'm sure the lunch and dinner is great.  They turn tables quick, so if you see a line outside, you'll probably only have to wait 15- 20 mins. 

I love their champion pancakes! they have granola mixed into the batter and really hit the spot.  They have great biscuits - so get excited!  

My husband loves that he can make his own omelette and he likes to order chirizo, broccoli and cheese - his way! :)"}
{"text":"Had to try the biscuits because that was the name of course. They were out of this world. Really good, I'm a fan of the food. The service was not great. I don't like putting a review up with that kind of info, but I has to speak the troof. When I went it was Sunday morning and the place was packed so I can understand that sometimes people get busy. I would say don't go after church on Sunday but you know that's the best time for a gnarly delicious breaky breaky. So its up to you, maybe they'll pay better attention to you, but I would suggest giving the food here a try if your in Gilbert and crave a good breakfast."}
{"text":"We eat here once a month or so.

Yes it's very busy, yes it's hard to provide 'great' service when it's busy.  But they do a good job still.

Good food, good prices, we keep going back."}
{"text":"I lived near this place for ever... and never tried it.  My friend is a breakfast-fiend so we decided to have a go at it one day.  We've been back several times since.  The food here is incredible.  

First - the namesake - the biscuits here are perfect.  Very light and fluffy and always warm.  

Second - The rest of the story.  I'm actually allergic to much of breakfast, so I stick to the lunch menu.  I have never been disappointed with anything I've ordered from this place.  In fact they are currently the top runner for best Reuben and best Turkey Melt in the city.  The portion size is pretty spot on.  Although I think they could give more in their sides (fries, rings, etc.).  I usually order a biscuit as well and leave very satisfied.

It's very much a breakfast and lunch place so its hours can be awkward."}
{"text":"Great food with excellent portions. The staff is friendly as well. The location can get fairly busy Saturday and Sunday though so there can be a long wait.

My only suggestion would be that they allow you to call in advance to get on the wait list and that they would improve the checkout process. You have to pay at the register versus pay your server. Since they are so busy they would probably benefit from a pay at the table solution."}
{"text":"Great spot.  The weekend wait is the only bad part.  Great dinner like breakfast.  Been here a dozen plus times and only had one issue and they made it right.  One of my favorites."}
{"text":"First time back since 2010. I ordered the Breakfast Burrito with bacon. It came with an order of refried beans and salsa. The burrito was hot and fresh, made to order and good size. The brands were tasty with an extra kick that reminded me of being cooked in cast iron. The salsa was like Pace Picante medium with extra cilantro. Overall it was a good burrito for $8.95. The service was good and we were seated right away."}
{"text":"I was really wanting to love this place. First the good. Super sweet staff, large portions, nice and clean, cute decor And what worried me... if you are called biscuits, the biscuits need to be awesome they need to be buttery and huge and bring you back to a simpler time- mine was cold and a little hard. I'm hoping it will as a fluke. Also my eggs were cold like they had sat a while."}
{"text":"Kids and I hit up Biscuits on a Sunday morning for a late breakfast.  Was warmly greeted, promptly seated, and treated with hospitality you don't always see these days.  I had a house omelette and it was about average in taste.  The country potatoes were good but I did request them a little more done.  The biscuit sole the show for me..wow...really good.  Will come back again in future."}
{"text":"The biscuits and gravy are one of the best I've had in Phoenix.  A little bit on the pricey side for breakfast though."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast thought we would tyr it out since it was new...Well the food was terrible my wife got very ill after eating there and the prices are very high....Don't see this place being in business very long"}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast. Had the biscuits and gravy with eggs, bacon and hash browns. Everything came out piping hot, the way I love it! Food came out extremely quickly and I was in and out in about half hour."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. A lot of food for the reasonable price. Our server made us feel like kids again with her sincere comments."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place. From The outside view to the waiting station to the food. Everything we ordered was delicious. I ordered the huevos rancheros. They were like nothing I've ever had. The service was exellent too. Will most definitely be back plenty of times. Check it out you won't regret it"}
{"text":"great staff very friendly,  we went looking for really great homemade sausage gravy and biscuits.  Food was ok, eggs and bacon very good.  Gravy  I dont think it was homemade,  its a shame but many restraunts like this add fresh sausage to a canned or powdered gravy,  its ok just not great.  Portion of hashbrowns very small.  Corned beef hash very different had great homemade flavor just lacked enough potatoes, my opinion.  Better than Dennys just not that great breakfast spot we were looking for."}
{"text":"This isn't the first time we've eaten here.  We choose to go here since we remembered the portion size being big.  

We had to wait 20 minutes for a table at 11am on a Sunday which is understandable.  Once we were seated we were taken care of.  We got pitchers of coffee and water.  Food came out fairly quickly.

We were very happy with the service and meal."}
{"text":"This is your average Biscuits location. Its not my favorite breakfast restaurant choice, but my hiking group wanted to get brunch close to South Mountain following a fairly strenuous hike. 

There were 10 of us, and unfortunately we had to be split up because the 2 available tables (right next to each other, mind you) were in separate sections and neither server wanted to take our group. So that made brunch difficult to communicate with everyone, so disappointing they wouldn't push them together

I typically order the same thing at Biscuits- the combo of scrambled eggs, sausage, breakfast potatoes & a biscuit. This meal wasn't bad, except it took for-ever to get out to us. Our tables ordered at the exact same time, but our table received our meals a good 15 minutes after the other table."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. And yes the biscuits are good. 
Might have to wait a bit for a seat. But good food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"First time here. Waitress friendly and warm. That is important to me.  Had french toast eggs, bacon. Best I have had in a long time. I am very picky like my eggs basted they were cooked perfectly. Bacon must be crisp and it was cooked crisp just how I love it. My husband had ribeye steak and that was cook just how we like it. I tasted potatoes and great taste. This place is a keeper. Drove from Maricopa and will drive down again."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this new place in my neighborhood. I was very disappointed though, I went on a Saturday morning which I knew would be busy but did not mind the wait time of 20 minutes the hostess informed our party of. The wait time ended up being closer to 40 minutes. Each person that came in was told the same wait time of 20 minutes. Once we ordered, the food took longer than expected to arrive at our table. We orders turkey sausage but received regular sausage that was burnt. The biscuits seemed undercooked in the middle and too much butter on top. I asked for a side condiment and never received it. The silverware and water cups had excess food on them as though they were not cleaned properly from their prior use. The waitress did not come back to check on us. The next time she came by was only to drop off our bill. Paying the bill was a chore as well. The hostess was putting together a \"to go\" order for a customer that appeared very unhappy. We had to wait for some time to pay until this \"to go\" order was finalized. This bad breakfast experience was over 2 hours and very expensive."}
{"text":"First time there. We were tired from moving and decided to get food. The biscuits and gravy, and omelette were good, as was the pot of coffee left at the table. They'll never know how much that was needed. The portions are good sized. I love that they give discounts to the military. I would have given 5 stars but some open sign kept falling down outside, and then the door wouldn't shut. Several workers just walked by and didn't seem to notice or care. The glare from the sun was a bit irritating with the door open or I wouldn't even have mentioned it."}
{"text":"We just beat the crowd in on Sunday, Service was good and the food was great. Fair price for portions, we will return again."}
{"text":"Biscuits were good.  I really do not want to write more. I really do not want to go back. Order poached eggs, bacon, Portuguese sausage (was not Portuguese sausage), biscuit and hash browns. Eggs were cooked good.  Hash browns were...well hash browns. Bacon. Bacon. Nothing special or overwhelming here."}
{"text":"Local, old school valley spot. Food is very good, they have outstanding chip beef (SOS) and biscuits and gravy. Classic diner with great food. I would highly recommend if looking for a tasty, quick breakfast."}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast a few weeks ago since I was in the area and had their chicken fried chicken, hash browns and eggs. Everything was really good and the portions were way too big. Service was also very good. Check this place out if you're starving and want to stuff yourself without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"Decided to come here with my dad while he is in town because snooze was too busy, best decision!!! The wait on a Saturday morning at 10:30 was only about 10 minutes or so, the atmosphere is laid back and cozy. It had a small town feel and we were given water right as we sat down which was nice. Our server was nice and the food came fairly fast, the portion was huge for the price! Amazing biscuits super yummy! Also the coffee was great!! I will definitely come back here again :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by before closing for lunch with hopes this locations food is much better than their Dobson location.

Ordered the Ruben with fries at register after inquiring what is popular for lunch, seated after order.  Received Ruben and okra, server corrected. But just say the okra was really good. 

Overall 3 star experience and food.  Will give this location another try."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped at Biscuits for breakfast. We experienced great service and food. My husband is really critical about his sausage and biscuits but said he really liked them here. I loved the hashbrowns."}
{"text":"We went there tonight for dinner. The service was good. But the waiter forgot our cheese sticks. So he ended up giving them to is for free with out us even having to ask. I thought that was pretty cool. Good job Denny's."}
{"text":"I definitely appreciated the 15% Veterans discount!  As one who served my country it's nice to occasionally feel appreciated for the service we provided to our nation.  It was Sunday so I anticipated a long wait time, but it was worth it.  Service was great and friendly, and the food was good ol fashioned breakfast."}
{"text":"If you're going to eat at a restaurant called, \"Biscuits,\" you better try the biscuits. I did and they were well worth the carb load and calories. I highly recommend the Biscuits Benedict (my friend and I split that as well as the breakfast burrito with bacon). Both entrees hit the spot, but I would lean toward trying a biscuit inspired meal if it's your first visit. 

Additionally, the service was prompt despite the busy Sunday morning rush. Nice way to end my stay in Arizona."}
{"text":"Oh ya!! This place is awesome! We had a soccer game down in Mesa and we were looking for breakfast and we saw this place. We stopped in and it's history after that. Next time we're down here we are stopping in. Service was fast don't be afraid of waiting the 20 minutes. We did and glad we did."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get some biscuits and gravy on a Sunday morning. Food came super fast and was yummy. Server Lisa was very friendly. Need more places like this."}
{"text":"OMG!  Best hug for your tummy anywhere!!  I've been there twice.  While their online menu says they only serve Pepsi products, I was THRILLED when I got there that they now have Diet Coke!!!  YEA!!  I had the French toast both times.  Dear God.  Delicious.  Comes out super hot with warm creamy butter and warm maple syrup.  It's Heaven on a fork.  Never had to wait and the wait staff is great.  Yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing, I ordered the  biscuits and gravy special the wait was a little long but as soon as we sat down we were greeted fast and our food arrived fast and hot that's the best part."}
{"text":"Not a bad breakfast place. They've got hearty portions and great service.

We've got a client that really likes this place, so we frequently meet him for breakfast here. 

I've had the eggs benedict, and the huevos rancheros - both were very hearty and filling, but didn't stand out as exceptional among similar fare at other breakfast places. 

Where this place shines is in the biscuits (imagine that). It seems that the dishes I order never come with them, but luckily our client doesn't like to eat his (imagine that). 

Their biscuits are crispy, flakey, light, and buttery, with a slightly moist center. They are golden in color and rich in buttery, savory flavor. I want one right now. 

It's likely that we will continue coming here for sometime to meet our client, so maybe I'll see you here one of these mornings!"}
{"text":"Portuguese sausage! Yes please! 

We come here about once a month, sometimes more. If you get there before 9am on the weekend there's usually no wait, and the food always comes out really fast anyways. 

I love that there is a place close to me that has Hawaiian selections on the menu that no one else in AZ dares to serve. No discrimination against spam here either, it's on the menu! The biscuits and gravy are also so yummy. 

The only thing I would improve is the potato selection; I always go with hashbrowns because I wish the country potatoes were served a little more crisp. 

Best home cooked taste mom and pop place in AZ!"}
{"text":"Deeelish! I came early one morning with my son. He had a BLT which he devoured. I had a the South Mountain Biscuits which was eggs and ham on top of a bicuit smoothered in gravy. It was great! 

May not be good for groups becuase all the tables are boothes. Maybe if you had just 6 or 8 it would be fine otherwise, the set up is for about 4.

Otherwise, it was great!"}
{"text":"The food and service is awesome. The South mountain scramble is super and the breakfast burrito is huge.  Ask for Steve.  He is the best server they have!  It is a little pricy but great atmosphere!  Country style!"}
{"text":"This is the first time we tried this place and I tell u -- this place is so awesome!! Will definitely be my breakfast place to be. Love the biscuits -- love the coffee -- my grits were so delicious!! *BURP*"}
{"text":"One of the best Breakfast places I've ever been to. They have the crowd pleasers like eggs and hash browns but the biscuits and gravy are what people come here for. Perfect amount of food for the price! It gets busy here so come early. Staff are also super nice and the restaurant is cosy."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat breakfast!! The biscuits are AMAZING! Everyone is also very friendly! And they have the best French toast!"}
{"text":"Me & my wife first time at this spot for breakfast. We weren't disappointed freshly squeezed orange juice. Delicious! Great service & good food. Will be back in the future............."}
{"text":"Went back for a 2nd go-round.  This time I got the B&G also.  It really was fantastic.  The gravy was about as perfect as can be with one exception - there weren't any sausage chunks.  

I opted for the country potatoes which I did not like at all - they were WAY too onion-y.  The hash browns are great.

This place gets high marks for the service - the owners are very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"This place has earned a spot as my new favorite. I have been trying Eggs Benedict all over the East Valley for a while now and this has been the best so far!! Our waitress was amazing, portions are huge, and everything was done in a timely manner. If you come with a large group, it's going to be hit or miss if you will have room since they only have one large booth and the rest of the tables sit about 4 comfortably. I got the Biscuit Benedict and it was delicious. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"There's nothing bad about this place; the service is timely and polite, the atmosphere is that of a small mom and pop cafe, and they even give you your drinks to go. The food however, at least the French toast that I had, was not anything special. I can't speak for the rest of the menu, which could be terrific, but the French toast I had tasted like the kind you can buy frozen in at the grocery store. I probably won't come again, but that's just because I like finding the \"best\" places and this place is just average."}
{"text":"My wife and I had an appointment at a specific time and we were running behind. We decided to try and find someplace to eat breakfast and after using Yelp, we stumbled across this place.  The food was amazing, the service was exceptionally fast and friendly.  We will be back!  Biscuits and gravy were off the hook!"}
{"text":"I hate the suburbs.  Why do you ask, do I hate the suburbs?  Because there is an hour wait for breakfast at 11 at most breakfast places in the 'Tuke. 60 freaking minutes for breakfast.

Thankfully we made the smart decision not to wait and made the trek to try out Biscuits.  We were greeted with a wait (20 Min) but the staff was quick to bus tables and service was speedy so it was more like a 10 min wait.

Their menu has a great variety but is mostly down home food.  I ordered the SOS and The Boy opted for the Chorizo Sampler.  First off, the portions are HUGE!  My SOS was 2, large biscuits cut in half and covered in gravy.  The gravy itself was just ok, tasted mostly of flour and pepper.  The boy enjoyed his Chorizo sampler and my hash browns were great.

Our server was pleasant, but was very scatter brained.  She missed the cheese on my hash browns and also asked me how I wanted my eggs cooked for the SOS, making me think they were part of the meal.  We got the bill and found an up-charge for the eggs I wouldn't have ordered if they weren't part of the meal (the menu listed 2 options for SOS, with or without eggs, another Yelper already posted a picture of it).  

Overall, we enjoyed our food, but with all the up charges it ended up being a $35 breakfast for 2 people."}
{"text":"This was my second visit in two weeks.  We were a party of four men.  After a short wait we were seated and served our drinks shortly after being seated.   The menu has some interesting choices like SOS and Spam.   After ordering our food came promptly.   In both visits the food was hot, tasty and plentiful.  Service was prompt and courteous.  My wife was upset when I told her where we went because she wants to comeback again.  A nice addition to this location that has changed hands many times over the last five years.  Highly recommended!
."}
{"text":"I placed 3 orders for pick up and suprisingly they said it would be ready in 10 mins. When I got there the food was already waiting for me at the conter. The lady who checked me out, although was nice and professional, was not as personable as I thought she could have been. She did not say good morning or how are you doing. Instead she goes \"pick up?\" In which I reply ed yes and began the check out.

Now for the food. Food was pretty good. I had the biscuit special. It was pretty food. Their sausage gravy didn't appear to have any sausage in it till I realized what I thought was mushrooms was actually the sausage. Regardless everything was pretty good. Eggs were delicious! Would definitely recommend this place
 Next time I'll eat in."}
{"text":"Everything here is good except the biscuits, coincidentally. Definitely recommend if you like a hearty breakfast."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast last week because I had a Groupon, and it was just ok. The service was fine, we had a nice woman as a waitress who was attentive. I thought the coffee was good, it had a nice nutty flavor. I ordered an omelet with avocado, onion, broccoli, and asparagus. I thought it was fine, but nothing special. The cheese they used didn't have a ton of flavor and I thought the home fries had a really weird flavor. The biscuit... which should have been really good.... was not so good. It was not flaky nor did it taste like what I expect from a good biscuit.... The BF got the biscuits and gravy and said he liked it, so that's why I added another star. Overall, I would not go out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"I wanted to take the bf to breakfast for his bday and he wanted an all American breakfast....

For a Sunday morning we didn't have to wait long for a table. I ordered an omlete.  It came with shredded cheese, avocado, and I also added onions. It tasted better with a side of salsa to it. However they went wayyyyyyy overboard on the onions. I should've added sausage to it. Lol 

They have a really big menu so I'll probably come back to try some more items."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch on a Sunday. They were busy, which was fine. I ordered a cinnamon roll and it was stale, not to mention cold. I asked them to take it back and got a buttermilk pancake instead. It was good, and enough food. Service was eh. She was nice enough but nothing special. Didn't take off the food they took back and still added the 20 percent gratuity. I wasn't impressed, nothing I would go back to. My family did enjoy the food they ordered this time and other times, to be fair."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast sandwich! I originally had the whole wheat granola pancakes with blueberries and I couldn't eat them, they were soooooo sweet. The server let me order something else instead, I had the breakfast sandwich on wheat and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Holy WOW! They definitely know what they're doing! They were busy but we weren't forgotten. The waitress was knowledgeable, friendly and offered suggestions with a smile. 
It's home country cooking with hugs portions for a reasonable price. I had the Biscuits Egg Benedict on the waitresses suggestion. The eggs were PERFECT!
I can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"YUM!! Eggs Benedict were perfect! Over time I've come to notice not everyone can make a good hollandaise sauce and I dug right into this one. Highly recommended. Service was ok and the air conditioner was out for a week the waitress said."}
{"text":"A-OK bfast! Definitely coming back!

PROS: I have to go healthy, but turkey sausage was pretty good. I cheat w/ hash browns, and was not disappointed: crispy outside, soft inside. Good sized portion of food!  Tasted my daughter's biscuit: light and flakey, and a perfect, slightly crisp bottom. Yum!  Service was excellent: the 3 folks working this morning were friendly and engaging, and service was prompt. 

CONS: I'm reaching here, but sourdough toast was meh, and likely from a  commercial source???  Would be mixed if they had a local, daily baked source . . . just sayin'.

Really enjoyed the bfast chow at Biscuits. If I lived here, I'd be a regular.

Cheers!

{"text":"Muffins enveloped in brown sugar, smokey thick bacon, biscuits smothered in sausage gravy and fresh eggs and tomatoes. Hearty all American breakfast!"}
{"text":"For a place called biscuits, I really was disappointed in the biscuits.  They were old, not warm and dry.  My mom got biscuits and gravy and when it was served the gravey made a mess on the floor and table.  Mom was given another plate but no one cleaned up the floor.  I cleaned the gravy after 20 minutes so we could leave without stepping in it.  KFC, Carl Junior biscuits are far superior and much cheaper. Will never go back"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. Always crowded but never a long wait. Piping hot coffee and waitress always checks to see if your party needs anything"}
{"text":"Alright food. Terrible service, had a breakfast brunch for Mother's Day and the owner was pushing us out of our table while we were trying to have our meal."}
{"text":"Awesome unpretentious restaurant. I have dined at both Chandler and Gilbert locations. Friendly staff. Substations permitted. Even in a Sunday the food came out fast and hot. Try the Ruben omelette. Sounds wired, but it's great."}
{"text":"So far so so good! Service has been great on a super busy Sunday morning. Got seated quickly! Ordered the Buiscuits and gravy of course! Wife Ordered the french toast with Ham, scrambled eggs and a biscuit on the side.... lol. they serve REAL chocolate milk! not milk with chocolate syrup:) even though i like it too. place is nice and has an open ceiling. loved the food! it was super yummy. definitely will come back here again. we got our check without asking for it, and were on our way when we wanted to be. great place."}
{"text":"great neighborhood cafe. it's on out regular rotation fir breakfast. weekends sometime a bit of a wait.  no biggie.  about 30 tables and always full. 
food is great. big portions. my favorite is the chicken fried steak and eggs."}
{"text":"The \"Biscuits Special\" is my dish of choice when we eat here. Don't tell my mom, but their biscuits and gravy are the best I've ever had. The French toast and pancakes are also good. My wife is a fan of the eggs Benedict. They offer a few unique breakfast dishes which include: SOS and fried spam and eggs. I would say Biscuits narrowly beats out The Good Egg as our favorite local breakfast stop."}
{"text":"Super awesome service! I've been in a few times but haven't rated until now.  We seem to always get the same waitress and she is really great. Food is good too!"}
{"text":"Biscuits never let's me down. The staff is always friendly and welcoming. Decent amount of food at a low price. #1"}
{"text":"Wonderful home cooked food with a home feel. Our waitress was lovely & attentive. The atmosphere is decorated with antiques. There was a little bit of a wait, we put our name on the list & were seating. I had the south mountain plate: biscuit covered in scrambled egg covered by ham covered by gravy, delicious!!!!! Will most definitely come back."}
{"text":"We usually make this our traditional breakfast stop on our way to Sunday afternoon Diamondback games. The wait can vary but is always well worth it. The staff I always fast and efficient. We have never been disappointed with anything off the menu. Great to see a locally owned establishment doing so well!"}
{"text":"Best eggs benedict. Hands down. Perfect poached egg, plenty of delicious hollandaise, ham and lighty toasted muffin . Drooling. Don't forget to try their dry aged bacon. It's amazing. Plenty of other great menu items, but I stick to what I know."}
{"text":"Oh wow. I mean, wow. That was a GREAT breakfast! Eggs cooked to a perfect scramble and not watery, crisp bacon and hash browns, and their namesake and gravy? WOW.  I practically licked my plate clean.

It's a cute place too. Farmhouse-style and spacious. Prices were pretty much the same as any other breakfast place. The reason it gets 4 stars and not 5 was the waiting. It wasn't busy, but we waited for a good 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged us, and then they asked if we were waiting for a table. Um, yes. Yes we were. Once we sat down there was another rather long wait, but once we ordered everything was prompt. I definitely would suggest this to others! I want to go back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Being that this place is called \"Biscuits,\" I had to try their biscuit and southern gravy.  It was pretty good!  Came super drenched in gravy.  The potatoes it was served with were just bland.  Could've used some seasoning.

I also ordered the cinnamon roll to share.  It wasn't my favorite cinnamon roll, as the glaze on top tasted more buttery and less like icing.  And the dough wasn't as soft/gooey as I like.

The good thing is that I came on a Saturday morning at around 10:30 and there was no wait.  They had a few booths and tables open, which is rare with most brunch places.

This place is basically like a step up from diner food.  I would come here again if I had a craving for pancakes or biscuits and gravy, but it won't be on my regular rotation of brunch places."}
{"text":"Aside from the waiter forgetting to put an entire order in for someone at my table, the champion pancakes are great. She ended up still bringing the food out for free."}
{"text":"I have been to this place at least 20 times.  The food here is great.  Normally the service is as well.  Wait to come in after 8am, that's when the A-team comes in.  Sadly, we came in at 7am.  I won't be deterred, I'll just come in later next time."}
{"text":"I'm rating this 3 stars for honest effort and ambiance.  The restaurant was pleasant, and the service was great.  Everyone working there was really, really friendly.  I was disappointed with my food, which was not bad, but not particularly tasty.  

I had the chicken fried chicken because it could be made to order - opting out of the chicken fried steak which I was told was frozen (I asked).  My food arrived promptly.  It was piping hot and the portion was generous, but it was all so bland. The chicken fried steak was like a chicken cutlet, and lacking flavor.  The gravy lacked flavor, and the sausage in it was difficult to see or taste.  My scrambled eggs  were ok as scrambled eggs go.  The biscuit lacked the texture I was hoping for, and the potatoes, while nicely cooked, lacked any savory element to speak of.  But after eating a small amount, I paid and left.  If I ever decide to go back, I think that I'll need to be very specific that I don't want my food to be bland. 

All in all, a pretty average experience."}
{"text":"My family and I have been here a handful of times, and everytime the food is so good, except today. The country potatoes were way to salty, everyone in my party who got them said the same thing.. we told the waitress, who then asked us to scrape a little on a plate so she could taste them,(like we were lying about how salty they were).. I got turkey sausage  and it was cold. My son got scrambled eggs and they were really runny.. The food is honestly better when the place is packed.  

The 2 waitresses that work there, Lynn and the blonde haired lady are the most rudest people I have dealt with, unless you are one of their regulars, don't expect a \"Hi, welcome to biscuits\"..  They rush you, they roll their eyes if you ask to many questions, more so the blonde haired lady.. The friendliest one is the bus boy. He is always so nice!  We definitely will not be going back for a long time, if ever..."}
{"text":"I normally really enjoy Biscuits Cafe; however, this location is a hot mess. How do you bring out an order of food where the country potatoes are ice cold, the steel cut oatmeal is watery, and the cinnamon roll is 1/2 cooked and floating in water, twice. Eat here at your own risk!"}
{"text":"Took my four sons here at lunch time. Friendly service great food. Two of us got pulled pork, one breakfast burrito with sausage, one Reuben, and one tuna melt. Portions were quite large, fries crispy and crunchy onion rings. Great fresh lemonade and refills on soda made this a pleasurable experience for us all."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast.  Not only are the biscuits wonderful, the bacon, eggs and bacon were outstanding. Excellent service and the decor is quaint and charming. I'm coming back tomorrow morning."}
{"text":"This location gets busy so be prepared to wait a few minutes. We've always gotten a seat within 15 minutes. May have to wait longer on holidays.

Good sized portions for the price. Some of the best biscuits and gravy in town. Staff is always professional and helpful and the service is great."}
{"text":"Service wasn't good, food was not great. I expected more from Biscuits, went in thinking it was related to Biscuits Cafe, but it can't seem to compare!"}
{"text":"I came here visiting from Colorado. It was a wonderful experience. Polite staff, quick service, great breakfast food. Menu was extensive, and large portions for the price. Everything I would want for a breakfast place, smaller but plenty of room. Well worth the wait. I would definitely return here. Wish the owner was still in Colorado now!"}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical after bad experiences with the previous restaurant on this site, but not to worry  -  It was Fantastic!! Breakfast was as good as any I've ever experienced. The home-made spam was flavorful with a hint of paprika ?? and spicy goodness. Eggs were cooked perfectly, the grits were creamy good, and the biscuit - oh my land. It was baked to perfection. Service was congenial, and timely. The place was spic-and-span clean to boot. As I was leaving a woman in one of the booths was noshing on the blueberry pancakes and they have my name all over them for next time. Yes, next time. Thanks Biscuits for coming to our neighborhood. We needed you!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to give this place a try for breakfast this weekend and even though we weren't necessarily impressed, we were satisfied. Biscuits has sort of a country themed menu so there weren't a whole lot of items that appealed to me (I am not a chicken fried steak / biscuits and gravy kind of girl). I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was pretty good. I mostly liked it because it was not super greasy. Hubby ordered the steak and eggs and was happy with his food as well even though he said it was pretty bland. I would agree, this place definitely servers basic home-style food without a lot of variety of flavors or spices. On the plus side we did finish our meal with a slice of apple pie and that was very good.

The service was just ok. Our waitress was friendly but we had to ask for silverware and after a coffee spill it took a while to get someone to come over and help (I would have been happy to clean it up myself but again we were not given napkins until after our food arrived). This mom and pop place had some unique seasonal decorations up by the hostess stand but the rest of the place was pretty boring and run down. I'd eat here again if I was close by but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Decent southern food. Great Biscuits!!  I would come here again to try their breakfast, but stopped in for the lunch.  Soup was amazing, but the southern fried catfish was very thin. I am used to southern cooking where the catfish is very thick and real good.  The fried okra was good as well.  I will be back to look into this place some more!"}
{"text":"Biscuits??? More like no biscuits left! I went there well before close and they informed me (after giving me drinks and letting me sit there looking at the menu for like 10 minutes ((horrible service too)) that they were completely out of all biscuits! anyways yeah. If you're gonna be called biscuits the least you could do is have some freaking biscuits right? That's all I want too. Horribly disappointed"}
{"text":"This place was delicious! Convenient breakfast spot. Service was great, everyone was so kind and the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was decent. Not incredible but not bad. Decent wait on a Sunday but once we ordered our food was out in 5 minutes. Friendly staff. Pigs in blanket were good. Biscuits and gravy were average could use more flavor in gravy."}
{"text":"I have driven by Biscuits on my way to work and decided to give them a try this last Saturday. After reading Yelp! reviews about how busy they are I decided it would probably be best to just order \"To-Go\". It was about 1:10pm. After checking their menu online at http://www.biscuitsaz.com/menu/ it clearly states \"Sat-Sun 7am to 3pm\". I figured out what I wanted along with my wife and kid and gave them a call. No answer, went to VoiceMail. I hung up and called again, same thing. It was now 1:30ish. Figuring they must be busy or momentarily stepped away from the phone I waited 10 minutes and called again. Same thing. I started to wonder if they were still open for business. Trying to be patient I waited until about 1:50pm thinking I have time because they're open til 3pm. This time someone answered the phone, I asked to place a To-Go order and was rudely told \"We closed at 2:00pm\".

I have several issues here. 

1. If someone had answered the phone sooner I could have got an order in before 2:00pm
2. Either I was lied to or your times are wrong on your menu, which is it?
3. Although close it was not yet 2:00pm

I would not have placed an order that close to closing, but the person on the phone could use some training on Customer Service. As a matter of principle the person answering the phone should be one of the best customer service people you have. Not some dude that has a bad attitude about me bothering him close to closing and just wants to close down. That is what I call laziness.

Because of this, I don't care how good your food is. I have no desire to come to your restaurant  to be treated crummy in person, ever.

Congratulations to your success Biscuits, but don't let it go your head.


**Update, the online menu states 2:00pm now."}
{"text":"We had 6 people in our party and needed somewhere that could take us pretty quickly because two people had to be at the airport within an hour. I saw the good reviews for Biscuits and when I called they took my name down and said we would be seated pretty quickly upon arrival, and we were! Service was fast and friendly and food came out quickly, but tasted fresh.  The place itself was cute. Very casual, but also gave a cozy, homey feel.

Again, we had 6 people - NO ONE had any complaints about their food, which is impressive! I had the huevos rancheros, which were on a large soft flour tortilla rather than crispy, corn ones, but was insanely delicious. I usually still have to add hot sauce to my huevos rancheros dishes, but the sauce they add in the kitchen made it absolutely delicious and I didn't need to add anything! I also had a side of their biscuit after a friend mentioned how wonderful they were, and it did NOT disappoint! So soft and crumbly and delicious! Other friends had omelets, scrambled eggs, benedicts, biscuits and gravy, fried okra, etc. Everyone was extremely happy with their dishes! Overall, reasonably priced, as well!"}
{"text":"The place feels like home, plenty of natural light coming through the windows. Waiting area has games for both kids and adults. Portions of food are pretty decent, and prices are not bad at all. Friendly servers and food was delicious!"}
{"text":"I love spam and eggs. Biscuits serves them and gives vets a 10% discount. Good enough for me."}
{"text":"We went to Biscuits for the first time this Friday night for an early dinner.

We were disappointed to find that breakfast is not served all day on Fridays, as they have their Friday Fish Fry.  

No matter, it just gives us an excuse to come back.

The chicken fried chicken was perfectly crispy and seasoned well.  DH ate EVERYTHING on his plate.  The only thing he did not really love was that the corn was heavily buttered.  Next time he will ask for no butter.  

The smoked chicken jalapeno alfredo was good, but I may skip it in the future.  I only found three small slices of jalapeno and I was hoping for something spicy.  This was very mild and the pasta was drowned in sauce.  Some people might like a lot of sauce, but I prefer it to be just coated... not floating.  It did come with two pieces of delicious garlic toast, which was a definite bonus.  If I do order it again, I will just ask for the sauce on the side and extra jalapenos for heat!

DD just had a grilled cheese with applesauce.  She did not like the applesauce because she happened to bite into a spoonful of cinnamon.  Oops!  DH didn't stir it for her and I sort of missed that, as well!

I asked the waitress for a biscuit and she brought one over to me to try,  It was actually very good.  It was not sweet like some other reviewers mentioned.  I found it heavy, but I like my biscuits that way!

The best part about Biscuits was the service.  The waitress was very nice and helpful.  One of the ladies from up front came by to check on us and even brought us a to go menu when we told her it was our first visit.  I mentioned their website had been down, but she said it should be up by now and that a lot of customers had mentioned it.  It's not up yet... hmm.

We will definitely come back to Biscuits again... next time for breakfast."}
{"text":"This place wasn't bad but it wasn't amazing. I did like that the portion sizes were large and their service was quick. However I feel like the food could have used a little more flavor. Not a bad place to go if you want a big breakfast. I would probably go again."}
{"text":"We are visiting the area from Texas and were excited to try this place out. It was a Tuesday morning, nothing special... Really nothing special. Coffee was so weak I thought based on the color that it was weak tea. The omelette wasn't particularly appetizing, the buttermilk pancakes quite heavy and the grits... What in the absolute what? I didn't even try them, there were layers of hard spots and runny parts under the way too thick 'skin' and I was positive it was actually a bowl of botulism. 

That brings us to the biscuits themselves... Well, if you are going to name your place after this relatively simple bread then you'd better at least get it right. Not the case. Neither fluffy nor flaky, the odd tasting biscuits were just unpleasant. If you'd like a better biscuit please see the Pillsbury tubes at your local grocer.

In short I recommend just making yourself a bowl of cereal, I'm a fan of Crispix myself."}
{"text":"I'm... Kind of confused. This Biscuits isn't part of the larger Biscuits restaurant chain...? Because if they are, they have their own menu, COMPLETELY different than the one you find online.

And they don't have one single waffle. 

What kind of breakfast place doesn't have waffles?!?

But in all fairness, the lack of waffles is my only real complaint. As a business (even an oddly named one...?) They were kind and clean and their food was definitely quality. Probably the best bacon I've had in years.

I just... Really wish they'd had waffles. Sadness."}
