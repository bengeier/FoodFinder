{"text":"Cedars Cafe is fantastic!  I've been here a few times for lunch, and the service is great, and the food delicious. The falafel sandwich is perhaps my favorite! It's unfortunate that they charge for extra sauce (hot sauce especially). Otherwise a no-frills place to enjoy my lunch break away from the office."}
{"text":"Delicious, healthy and fresh food is the standard here.  We've been eating here almost weekly, for  a year and we've never been disappointed.  The owners are really friendly and know their Lebanese cuisine.  The restaurant is always clean and bright and the BYOB is a huge plus, IMO.  They also offer wi-fi and the few times I've gone for lunch there's always someone working on their computer.  My favorite dishes are the chicken shwarma platter and samik harra (I think that's the spelling, it's the spicy tilapia platter)."}
{"text":"This is a delicious place to eat!  The owners are so friendly and the food is outstanding!  It takes a lot of work to make this type of food so I really appreciate that they are here to make my lunches healthy and delicious!  Thank you for opening! Keep up the good work!  The labneh is homemade and very creamy and delicious.  The house salad is very close to the sulata I make at home.    They also sell pita bread (the good kind!) in the shop as well as other neccessary ingredients for making your own Lebanese food at home."}
{"text":"NOMMMMMSSSSSSSSS  Reasons why I love cedars: 1. cleanest restaurant i think I've ever seen - I could eat off of the floor, 2. Food (ill get to that later), and 3. the family that owns it is the sweetest.  So let's talk food. I love falafel and hummus and greek salads and that is why the falafel wrap is the best thing in the entire world. The falafel is warm and crispy and the lettuce and onions and tomatoes are all extremely fresh. The hummus is an addition to the wrap but so worth it. It's the perfect consistency, just the right amount of garlic and is homemade. The salad is also very fresh and the dressing is light and flavorful. Perfect for lunch and they have take out so you can eat on the go.   Again, the family is the sweetest and the boy who waits the tables is friendly and efficient.   Loves it. Anyone who likes falafel and hummus NEEDS to try it."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic middle eastern food. The vegetarian platter is my favorite. The falafel and hummus is outstanding."}
{"text":"This is a great, clean, friendly place for excellent falafel, an shwarma pita wrap, Turkish coffee and baklava.  My GF is in love with the fatoush salad."}
{"text":"Great, fresh, authentic food, always excellent service! My wife and I eat here regularly, and have never had a bad experience. Also family owned, which adds a nice personal touch. Highly recommend the chicken shawarma!"}
{"text":"Excellent Mediterranean food.  Service was great at this family owned Lebanonese restaurant.  I loved the lamb dishes  and the portions are large enough for lunch tomorrow.  If you're in Malvern, seek out this hidden gem on US 30 across from the Boat Yard Sales."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to eat. Quality food. Great service. Highly recommend for a nice mediterrean food"}
{"text":"I love this food and i love the people! Every time i walk into Cedars i am greeted with a big friendly smile! BYOB  Food is fresh and always super tasty!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Fast, friendly service, great prices, wonderful selection and fresh, tasty dishes. Try the falafel. I was very impressed."}
{"text":"Wow Shawarma all covered in turmeric and cooked on a grill like a cheesesteak gross!! The grape leaves tasted like they came from a can and the hummus tasted likes sour beans and garlic?? I don't get it!"}
{"text":"Never tried Lebanese food till we found Cedars!  Fresh, bright, delicious food, with friendly, welcoming service.  Sandwiches for lunch are under $8 and include salad or fries, generous portions on the platters, too. Have tried almost 10 different dishes, all of which were new to us, and all have made us very happy.  Cedars has opened up a whole new world of flavors for us!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem; we have eaten there many times before plays at People's Light and Theater nearby. BYOB. Generous portions of excellent food.  My favorite is kibbeh, ground beef with spices and pine nuts shaped into torpedo shapes.  Best baba ganoush anywhere.  Service is very pleasant."}
{"text":"Mislead by Yelp reviews to this place. Rice was bland and honestly, nothing authentic about this middle eastern cuisine. I was happy that they let me buy pita bread by the bag. Guess I will go the city for the best middle eastern food around. What a dream come true it would be if it was right near home."}
{"text":"Food is good but they aren't actually open until 9 p.m. The kitchen closes at 8:30.  You are just allowed to sit in the restaurant until 9. Very misleading..."}
{"text":"The wife and I went to Cedars Cafe for the first time today and we LOVED it. Service was extremely friendly and the food was some of the best Lebanese food we've had - definitely the best we've had in PA.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I cannot express the feeling of contentment in words, the food is so good at Cedars Cafe!  Craving Shawarma for over two months, I found this heavenly place. I went along with my sister and ordered Feta and Zattar Lebanese pizza with Shawarma Platter.  The chicken on bed of rice with hummus on the side was perfect portion for one person. As a coffee lover, I also requested a Turkish Coffee which came in a beautiful cup and saucer. Everyone is friendly and service is well timed for perfect conversation with your loved ones while hot food arrives at your table."}
{"text":"Been coming since they first opened which has been around 4 years I believe. We go usually around once or twice or week and I can say that over the 500 meals I've had here that it's been reliable"}
{"text":"The food is fresh and made to order! Can't beat that. The salads are always crisp and you'll never find those rotten lettuce pieces you usually find in salads at restaurants. They have a very nice menu. The hummus is so yummy! I usually get the shawarma chicken and my husband likes the lamb. We have tried the chicken tawook as well! The portion sizes are good and the plate is nutritionally balanced. My favorite salad (well, one of my favorites :) ) is the fattoush salad which comes with a nutty dressing. It's also a great place to get dessert and the meal you eat will allow for plenty room to have a little sweetness after your meal without feeling guilty or overfilled."}
{"text":"I'm Middle Easter and their food is as good as back home (if not better!) love love the shish tawook, kibbe, and stuffed grape leaves. Amazing service - highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Nice servers but that is the only nice thing about this place. I ordered the Schwarma platter and my wife ordered the chicken Schwarma platter. My dish came out dry, tough and tasteless. My wife's wasndry and without seasoning also but  the garlic spread that came with her dish made it a little better.nWe were soooo disappointed with the food. We will not be back"}
{"text":"Close friends took us out to dinner here and we enjoyed it. Sampler appetizer and Shwarma were big hits. My teenager that has never had this cuisine wants to come back. Great find."}
{"text":"Had lunch with some colleagues today. Two of us enjoyed the Vegetarian Mix platter. Delicious! My plate was completely empty. I hadn't been here in years and it was yummy to come back!"}
{"text":"We've dined at the Cedars Cafe many times. The Lebanese food is authentic, prepared fresh, and of course, delicious. The atmosphere is welcoming, with Lebanese music softly playing in the background. The people are genuinely warm and friendly, and the space is clean and comfortable. My favorite meal is the vegetarian platter; my Irish husband likes the lamb kabobs and the kafta. We both love the tabouli. I make it occasionally, but it's work intensive, so we order it every time we go to Cedars.   I saw a negative review in which the reviewer said, \"nothing authentic about this middle eastern cuisine.\" Seriously? Well, I AM Lebanese, and I can vouch for the authenticity of this restaurant's offerings. Go. You'll want to go again, and again ..."}
{"text":"Very nice family owned and operated business. Ordered the sampler appetizer (says \"dinner only\" on menu), and the vegetarian platter, as well as a tub of hummus and one order of kataifi and one order of namoura to go. Got there at 1:30 pm to pick order up and there were no other customers so very quiet. All of our food was extremely fresh and really tasty. We especially enjoyed the stuffed grape leaves. They are usually served cold, but here they are served warm, which, imho was so much better.  Deserts were excellent too."}
{"text":"Finally! Lebanese food in southern Chester County...and it's good. Favorites include kibbeh, fattoush, and hummus. I can't wait to work my way through the rest of the menu. The space is incredibly clean and the service couldn't be friendlier."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! I almost always get the chicken Schwarma sandwich- it has a delicious garlic sauce! I always get the house salad with it- it's dressed only with lemon and oil and spices and it is soo yummy!"}
{"text":"Very clean, very bright and cheery, great place for lunch. The food is prepared with care and it is authentic and delicious. Everything is so fresh. The waitstaff are really nice and even when they are super busy they treat the customers kindly. The falafel is awesome, everything I have ever had is great. Their hummus and their baba ganoush is wonderful. I also recommend the baklava if you have room!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite restaurant in the area.  My family and I come here a lot and everything is always delicious, especially the shawarma and the garlic paste served with it.  The staff is very friendly too.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Their food Is delicious! I love their shawarma platter. It comes w hummus and salad.. everything taste fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"sooooo glad I found this place. I love falafel and finding a place that makes it well out in the suburbs it kind of difficult. Also, my girlfriend is vegan and gluten free so finding anywhere to accommodate her diet can be a task in itself. Cedar's takes care of both of these jobs, vegan, gluten free, tasty falafel for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Overall, great vegan restaurants on the east coast are sadly hard to come by. So often you get meat experts trying to appease the throng with 'national' (Chinese, Italian, Middle-Eastern) vegan cuisine or vegan versions of classic cuisine. It can be very frustrating!   At Cedar's Café, located in a strip mall, you'll find traditional Lebanese cuisine that's cooked to perfection. The ambience hearkens to the 1980's depressing diner décor with silk flowers and brass with clear plastic appointments; not appealing at all. The service is also luke-warm at times with the wait staff not being as friendly as their potential would allow. Portions are huge and quite satisfying.   Upon my two usual critical visits, I have found the best value to be the vegetarian sampler with flavorful falafel, stuffed grape leaves and other such favorites.   Because of the poor atmosphere, inconsistent service, however great food, I have submitted a rating of 4 stars."}
{"text":"An unexpected delight in a mall.  Service was very attentive and the food came out quickly.  They bill themselves as authentic.  I am not sure about that, but the flavors are great and the food seems to be fresh.  Nothing canned or frozen.  We had hummus and pita to start, lots of flavor.  Some hummus just tastes like ground up chick peas with oil but this one was good.  Then I had a chicken plate.  Generous portion for lunch.  The salad on the side had mixed greens, not all iceberg lettuce, yay.  Tomatoes were decent for February.  There was a side of raw garlic in yogurt, almost like tzatziki without the cucumber.  Very pungent.  All in all a great experience.  I will be back."}
{"text":"The owner said the grill was closed when we Walked it at 8:28 and proceeded to usher us out the door. Forget the food, the service was just sad. Would not come here again. What a waste of an uber!"}
{"text":"My friend picked this restaurant because we were going to a movie right down the street from here. I didn't even know this place existed. Huh?  I very much like middle eastern food so I was happy to try it out. And I'm glad I did.  Very nice people.  Family owned restaurant.  Clean place. We were very happy.  It is not a fancy place, you do not have to dress up.  I believe the owner is the cook, his daughters are the servers and his 6 year old son/grandson is his manager.  Smile. We will defintely be back."}
{"text":"We love this place!!  The family that owns it takes great pride in this place and work very hard to make the high quality food and provide great service.  The food is excellent, fresh and well made. The prices are reasonable.    We love this place so much that we have shared it with friends and family who agree that it's amazing and we frequent it!  Go if you like this kind of food and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We often need to drive to Malvern to visit a vet specialist. We stumbled onto this restaurant, and boy, is it a hidden gem. Great Food, well spiced (not bland). The hummus and stuffed grape leaves are some of the best I've ever eaten. Grape leaves served warm -  very tasty!!! The tilapia dish is outstanding if you want to try something different. Have not worked my way through all the desserts, but you can't go wrong with the baklava. Service is great and friendly -- esp to our 2 year old daughter.  Eating here has become a bit of a ritual.  We love this place!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good, but the bowls are not as filling and don't have as much food as Naf Naf grill. I think they might be more expensive too? Otherwise, it was OK for lunch. I know people love this place so I'd have to come back and try another dish to see if I love it or not"}
{"text":"The falafel was dry. The fries weren't seasoned. The baklava was meh."}
{"text":"Food: 4 Service: 4 Value: 3  Love the shawarma here. Very good lunch spot for Malvern."}
{"text":"The service fine.  The restaurant was clean.  Food was fine.  All in all it was not bad but it was nothing really special either.  Seems like a reliable place to frequent for lunch."}
{"text":"Had lunch. Food competently made. Large portions. Falafel appetizer, you get many, 7-8 balls rather than the few 2-3 I have come to expect from Middle Eastern restaurants. Thin tasty pita bread served for free with tahini sauce, could taste the sesame. Schwarma very large but could have had more sauce. Too much acid, not enough creaminess or sweetness. Very mild subtle underlying spiciness. House salad too much vinegar. In conclusion, not the blandest and not the tasty Middle Eastern food I have had. Left feeling kind of meh. Might try again but nothing exciting."}
{"text":"Food was tasty with the exception of baba ghanush which felt a little bitter. I am taking off 2 stars because the woman that served us was rude and kept giving my friend dirty and annoyed looks from the minute we stepped in. If eyes could kill my friend would be probably dead))) Her strange behavior is the only reason why we won't be back at this establishment."}
{"text":"Excellent tahini, hummus and kabbeh! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I like Cedars Cafe and would recommend it to others. I eat at Cedars Cafe about 5-10 times a year. So far always went during lunch time. Cedars Cafe is a family owned place with very nice and tasty selection of Mediterranean food. I liked their Shawarma and Chicken Shawarma platters with Hummus. Also like their Shawarma and Kafta sandwiches with house salad. They have very tasty Baklava. One thing I could not handle is their Yogurt Drink which is too salty for my taste... but their Turkish Coffee is great. My friends tried their Falafel and said it was very tasty (I am not a huge falafel fan so cannot say from personal experience). Also very friendly service and nice atmosphere to enjoy your food while talking with friends. I would recommend to give Cedars Cafe a try if you are in the area and like Mediterranean food. If you will be visiting please check open hours first, as it took me a while to get used to the fact that they are closed on Sundays and Mondays. :-)"}
{"text":"I don't know how anyone could write a bad review about this amazing authentic Lebanese restaurant! The food is absolutely delicious. I can't find any other Lebanese or any Mediterranean restaurant that offers such a delicious and fresh variety of dishes. My family and I drive over 2 hours to get to the place because it is worth it. In a few words, great music, very friendly and sweet owners, quiet atmosphere, and delectable homemade dishes. But I also have to say that I don't agree with some other reviewers - WIFI is not needed in a small cafe such as this, otherwise, it will attract a lot of noisy and unproductive people. I recommend this cafe and will always come back!"}
{"text":"Synopsis: Good food, excellent friendly service, clean and bright. A bit overpriced for entrees.  The whole story:  Long day. Hungry. \"Honey, check your phone. What's on the way home?\" \"Let's try this middle eastern place. If we don't like it, there's sushi next door.\" We drove up. Well lit, a fair number of people inside at 7pm on a Saturday. Good sign! Enter a clean restaurant, seated by a friendly server. Take kids to wash hands. Bathrooms are SPOTLESS, I mean, they look better than a display at Ikea! Return to table to peruse the menu. Entrees more than I want to spend, but OH! Good! Sandwiches on the back of the menu. I order a chicken schwarma which comes with salad. He gets a veggie sampler entree (falafel, hummous, babaganoush, salad, grape leaves, tahini sauce) and kids split a kibbeh appetizer with cucumber yogurt.   Food arrives quickly, by smiling server who comes back to check on us, fill our water. Great service! Sandwich was ok, but more bland than I'm used to (see my Kebaba review; they are my Gold Standard). I especially didn't like the pickles in the sandwich (try pickled red onion instead!) so I added some of his tahini sauce and the kids' cucumber salad (too garlicky for them). He enjoyed his food, though grape leaves were a bit grainy. All food was fresh and well presented.   We left full and happy, too full, in fact, to sample the rice pudding, semolina cake, baklava, or other offerings.  Note: they also sell middle eastern ingredients to make your own food at home.  I think entrees are overpriced for the atmosphere, but sandwiches are more value-oriented. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Authentic, gem of a place.    Cedars Cafe serves the real-deal Lebanese cuisine in a comfortable and friendly environment.  There are a few other ethnic/specialty eateries in the same shopping center, such as a popular BBQ joint and a Thai restaurant.  My favorite spot, however, is Cedars Cafe.  Here are some highlights: - Super friendly owner, who checks on each table personally - he goes the extra step to make sure you feel welcomed (as an aside, I notice this in Middle Eastern restaurants) - Hummus is creamy goodness - I get mine sans extra olive oil, so I can enjoy the purity of the chickpea ingredients - Grapes leaves, Kibbeh, and Falafel are all stand out for the vegetarians - Chicken Schwarma and Lamb dishes are great for the omnivores - the chicken schwarma, in particular, is excellently marinated, served with a garlic dipping sauce, and comes atop a bed of fragrant rice with a lightly dressed salad and the aforementioned stellar hummus to boot  Free refills, absurdly low prices, you can't get better than this.  Even the appetizers are served with extras such as pickled vegetables, which shows a devotion to the customer experience and harkening to the flavors/textures of Lebanese cuisine.  Oh, for the Middle Eastern neophytes, they have a lamb gyro with french fries lunch special that is an easy first step."}
{"text":"I've been to Cedars five or six times for lunch now, and every time i visit the food is fresh and delicious.   While the entrees are a little on the expensive side to try for lunch, the sandwich prices are perfect and are big enough to serve as lunch for two days.  The service has been spotty. Occasionally the staff are very warm and welcoming; other times they seem a little more on the chilly side. I think this is proportional to the volume of customers they are entertaining at any given time. So if you're there when the restaurant is empty, you can expect smiles and quick, efficient service. If you're there when it's busy, it could be a while before you get your food/bill.  For me it's a small price to pay, i'll keep going back for the awesome hummus, falafel, and pita sandwiches."}
{"text":"Really like this place and especially that they take time and prepare food from scratch. I love their vegetarian platter, chicken schwarma ( prob misspelled it:)) sandwich or platter. It's clean, spacious, Lebanese music in the background and service friendly. One of my regular spots to eat in the area. Wish pita would be better."}
{"text":"My first time at this restaurant was about 3 weeks ago. I was greeted with a warm welcome and a smile. I had a beef type of wrap and it was served with a really fresh and crispy side salad-I passed on the fries that were also offered. . It was a delicious lunch and I will be back for sure. I have never had Lebanese food and I really enjoyed it. The owners are friendly and the restaurant is spotless. Great food so far."}
{"text":"When they first opened, I was hoping they would be a distant branch of Cedars in Orlando, FL.   This is a family run operation, which is cool.   The food is good but not great - if you are familiar with Lebanese or middle eastern food, you will probably not be blown away."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent.  My family frequents almost all Middle Eastern restaurants within a 50 mile radius of Philly, and several in NYC- so we've been to A LOT of them.  Cedar's is in our top 10.  We typically order tapas style by feasting on MANY appetizers- cold and hot.  We'll order one chicken platter to share as well.  As such, I can't comment on their entrees, but I can tell you the appetizers and chicken shawarma are excellent!!!  The staff are friendly and the dining area is clean.  The decor is plain, and my 11 year old son astutely noticed that there is an inverse relationship between the quality of food and the fanciness of decor when it comes to Middle Eastern cuisine.  Put this place on your list."}
{"text":"I love middle eastern food and this place was very good I enjoyed the Veggie sampler very much!"}
{"text":"Wow!  What a pleasant surprise! Wonderful Mediterranean restaurant in Malvern PA?  Yea!  The food is excellent.   The only thing about this restaurant is the location is hard for out of towners to find.   They are in a shopping center near a PepBoys and a former Staples.     Two suggestions to the owner -  a)  It's 2016 - offer WiFi.   b)  Market to the local hotels.   The out of towners don't know about you."}
{"text":"The best hummus and lamb shwarma's. That's all that really needs to be said."}
{"text":"Not a great night to review this restaurant as I think either a cold or flu was starting , but it was good food. I thought the grape leaves were ok, but were a little mushy. The talapia entree was fresh and came with salad and rice. The Kebab platter was 5 pieces of lamb on rice with salad. Both the salads lacked much taste on the dressing , which is my only real complaint about the whole meal. Plenty of parking in the strip mall lot and they take all plastic, and it's BYO."}
{"text":"Food menu is very impressive, especially since the middle eastern influence is there. Fast and friendly staff"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I went last night for the first time and I was very impressed. I had the Trio App as my dinner. It came with Hummus, Stuffed Grape Leaves, and Falafel. The hummus was great. It wasn't watery like I've had at other places. Grape leaves were awesome. I'd never had falafel until last night and I was amazed. I'm kicking myself now because it took me so long to try falafel. I went back today for lunch with a co-worker. I had the falafel sandwich. It was rolled in pita and stayed together nicely. The combo of flavors in the sandwich were delicious. This place is on my way home from work. I can see myself stopping frequently for take-out. It's a BYOB, which is always a plus."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch before returning home from a trip to Longwood gardens.  Oh my delicious.  Had the graphics leaves and chicken swarma hummas bowl.  Husband had the lb and beef swarma.  Everything was fresh and so tasty.  Service was fast and so nice.  If I am ever in the area would come back."}
{"text":"I first started eating Lebanese food in Pittsburgh in the 60's. Since then have tried a few restaurants in Philadelphia. Imagine my delight when I ran across the  Cedars Cafe in Malvern, so close to home! One can tell that everything on the menu is homemade with great care. From the wonderfully seasoned  grape leaves to  the hummus and baba ganouj.  The first time I tried the grape leaves I could tell they were homemade because the flavor is so distinctive! The lamb kebob is delicately grilled to order. I like medium ! My husband enjoyed the chicken schwarma, which also has its own distinctive flavor. The tahini and schwarma sauce, a garlic derivative, which goes great with the chicken, enhances the flavor. The salad is always cut into delicate pieces and pleasantly seasoned. The cucumber is very crisp and freshly cut! We have tried most items on the menu by now, which has been enhanced with some pizza selections. We have consistently had great experiences at this wonderful restaurant!"}
{"text":"Very reliable Middle Eastern restaurant. We have been here many times and the food was always fresh and tasty. Service is prompt and it has never been crowded. The Talipia platter is excellent and the prices for Middle Eastern favorites are moderate. Their falafel and Pita bread are first rate."}
{"text":"I have to say that I tried few more items and all were fantastic. The owners and staff are really nice. I especially liked their grilled tilabia (semeke hara) which is amazing."}
{"text":"A group of seven hungry hikers from the Chester County Trail Club arrived at 8 pm  after hiking at Valley Forge. Several of us seek vegan food, so we need to find restaurants that know what they're doing in that respect.   We had reservations and we ordered from the menu. Most of us had some version of the mixed appetizer plate or the larger mixed dinner plate. The service was prompt and friendly, the atmosphere low-keyed, clean and comfortable.   Everything--stuffed grape leaves, felafel, hummus, baba ghanouj--was very nicely done and they even serve pickled turnip as a garnish; love that touch!   The staff is kind and confident when responding to vegan questions (such as: \"No yogurt in your tahini sauce, is there?\" Because some places do add it).   To sum it all up: Vegans will feel comfortable here and the food is satisfying, delicious and fresh even in the final hour before closing time. Everyone in our party agreed that we'd enjoy coming here again.   Look for the 'Staples' sign to easily find Cedars."}
{"text":"We are in town for a visit and stopped by this gem. In a small strip mall area (Westgate Plaza), doesn't really stand out but the food was great! My husband and I had the The Trio for the appetizer, he had the Schwarma combo and I had the Chicken Tawook. The trio was lovely- we enjoyed 2/3- wasn't particularly thrilled about the stuffed grape leaves, but the hummus was amazing! According to my husband, Schwarma was good lean meats, well seasoned and complemented with the given sauces. I enjoyed the chicken pieces- not too charred and the salad was lightly drizzled with a vinaigrette (yum)! The waitress was very welcoming and the service was great! :)"}
{"text":"This place is great.  I can't do any better job than the other positive yelpers so I will highlight delicious food, awesome service, and CLEAN.    I will add that they do have Turkish Coffee - tiny cup, strong coffee, pure bliss.    This was our first time trying Cedars, but we will be back again."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and delicious. The owner is very pleasant, and the service is excellent. There is nothing on the menu that I've tried , that isn't tasty."}
{"text":"It's always a good indication when you walk into an establishment, that it's busy and has many patrons eating.  I don't like eating at a restaurant for the first time and nobody is in there.  That speaks volumes to me.    Cedars Cafe is a Lebanese themed restaurant.  Various \"local\" foods on the menu.  I had the shwarma to go which was good.  I don't know if the food as been altered to appeal to American tastes.  I need to visit Lebanon and compare!   I will return to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch places!  Great food and amazing service.  The chicken schwarma or chicken tawook sandwiches are always reliable.  If you go for the sandwich get the house salad. I don't know what the dressing is, but it's tasty.  Cedars is also a great choice for dinner.  I highly recommend one of the appetizer samplers if you are dining with a group--there is a veggie option in addition to the more traditional meat choices and neither disappoints. To gild the lily, Cedars is also BYO--it doesn't get much better than this in the suburbs!"}
{"text":"Excellent food....I would kill for the baklava...I was lucky to have had choclate baklava 2 years ago ..still hoping they get it bk on menu....nice ambience...good staff....kudos!!!"}
{"text":"The beef and lamb shawarma was outstanding.  Good portions.  Decent amount of traffic for a weekday in the Great Valley area but not packed.  Menu items for lunch options somewhat limited."}
{"text":"Take out the first time, eat in the second - both superb. Delicious, fresh food from scratch - flavorful and healthy with friendly attentive service. The shawarma is delicious and salad was beautifully plated and tasty. Best baba I've had in forever. I love middle eastern food and this place just became my go to place in PA."}
{"text":"Service was s bit slow at first, but not enough to be worrisome. Food was excellent & deelish!"}
{"text":"Found this place through a spin on the Yelp app, and gave them a shot at lunch today.  I'm a huge fan of Middle Eastern cuisine (huge, literally).  To see a Lebanese place near me was too much to resist.    I certainly was not disappointed.  Got the plate of mixed shawarma, and loved every bit of it.  The meats were tender and perfectly marinated.  Real hummus with some olive oil to top it off was a good choice for a side dish.  Everything was fresh and generous.    I've been to cheaper places than this.  They're not overly expensive, but they are maybe a buck or two higher than other comparable places.  But they do give you a nice sit down atmosphere with very friendly service and more than enough food to make you happy."}
{"text":"I have been several times since they opened a few weeks ago. The food is fresh, well cooked and delicious. The owners are very sweet people with great pride in their food and service. What an amazing addition to Frazer!!!"}
{"text":"What an amazing food.! I was extremely surprised by the delicious food that I ate here. I tried the appetizer sampler and the yogurt cucumber salad which were above anything i have ever tried. As a European I have tried many different Mediteranean restaurants. Some of them very expensive and definitely not so good. The staff  here is very friendly and helpful. I would have gone today again and tomorrow if it wasn't closed. I come in the area for work, so I'll be back very soon. YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"It's gotta be authentic Middle Eastern cuisine, they don't serve gyro. The Pita sandwiches are a perfectly rolled size and tightness for ease of eating. Their tabouleh has a nice character too, with tomatoes as the chief ingredient followed by parsley and then Bulgar wheat, I hate when bulgar is the first ingredient at other places."}
{"text":"This is a class act. Classic Lebanese dishes done with heart and soul. Everything beyond fresh--I don't even know how they get those vegetables so crisp year-round. Wondeful hospitality and and an impeccably clean space."}
{"text":"Visited Cedars tonight while in town on business.  It was delicious!!  I am half Lebanese so I'm pretty picky about my middle eastern food - this place did not disappoint.  As everyone else has stated, it was immaculate and the service was super friendly.  I came in pretty late, only about 45 minutes before closing so I was the only one in the restaurant.  I had the Cedars Combo: hummus, labne, falafel, kibbeh, grape leaves, sanbousek and they substituted tabouli for the baba ghanouj for me without any trouble.    My food came out a bit slow, but I suspect this was because they were having a slow night so everything was prepared fresh.  Both the kibbeh and the sanbousek were hot and crispy, had not been sitting around at all, and the bread was warm and soft.  Everything tasted delicious and was prepared just right.  I'm always leery of ordering grape leaves in restaurants because they are often canned and taste mushy and oily.  These were fresh and tasted just as they should.  My only complaint was that the parsley in the tabouli tasted a little off, like perhaps it was re-hydrated dried parsley rather than fresh.  It might just be that it was chopped very fine, and it tasted good anyway so not such a big deal, just not exactly what I expected.  I ordered a piece of baklava to go before leaving, very glad I did!  It was one of the highlights of the meal - light and crispy, not drowned in sugar syrup and just the right amount of nuts.  I will definitely come back to this place whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and it was amazing. It's a small place with limited seating but that didn't bother me. There were not a whole lot of people here but that might be because it's chilly out today and expected to snow.  I was hungry though and had the falafel sandwich and hummus. It was delicious that I'm still devouring on the remnants of what's left of my hummus. The flavors here are amazing.  Service here is also not bad but I can see how it can get difficult if there's a crowd. It didn't affect me today and so I'll be leaving happy."}
{"text":"Authentic Lebanese food, very fresh and deliciously seasoned. Owner and his family is very friendly and food came out promptly. We had the freshest and most delicious Baklava we have ever had in US!!"}
{"text":"Very good food at good prices.  I have never been to the Middle East and do not know just how authentic Cedars is, so it's hard to rate them as 5 stars.  But I enjoyed their food very much and plan to go back.  The service was great, too.  I had the Shawarma Mix, and it was all I could handle."}
{"text":"Best shwarma around. This place is amazing. It's also byob, so you don't have to spend a fortune to go out with friends."}
{"text":"What a find, the food is great and the owners a wonderful.  The portions are large you have to come and try. It is very authentic Greek food."}
