{"text":"Barque serves up juicy, exquisitely cooked meats, delivering subtle and harmonious flavours with a bias towards the sweet.  A decidedly safe combination for a BBQ joint, but when's the last time you craved safe BBQ?"}
{"text":"i've been here for brunch where i had the pork belly breakfast tacos which were superb; but i'm really here to tell you about an experience i had coming here for lunch. a friend and I had gone out the night before and were looking for something to revive us, but it was a wednesday afternoon so we knew brunch was not an option. i'd been raving about barque for weeks and we were on our way out of the city anyways (its on the way to the queensway) so we decided to stop in for lunch.  BEST LUNCH EVER!!  i'm a sucker for free stuff (aren't we all) and i gotta tell you, this place was on point. immediately when we sat down we were offered complimentary sparkling and still water and a little tin of smoked popcorn (which was to die for). we promptly demolished them and as we were pondering if it was appropriate to swipe some off a neighbouring table, the waitress popped over with a fresh supply. we ordered lattes which were spectacular (not that i know much about coffee) and then ordered lunch. we both went for Sliced Pork Bun (it has hickory sticks , bbq sauce and kohlrabi) which came with a side of fries. the sandwich was DELICIOUS, juicy perfection, and even my bottomless pit of a stomach had to wrap up half! largely due to the fact that the fries were outstanding - i couldnt bare to leave a single fry on my plate (they dont save well) so i dummied them and packed up half my delicious sandwich for later. we were then handed nice little wet naps to clean off our hands.  the decor and ambiance and whatnot are all great too; not that it really matters when everything else is perfect. they're fuckin killin it over there; best $23 i ever did spend!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice and it's GREAT fun here.  I love family night: nothing more fun than being surprised by all kinds of delicious foods for $25.  Last time I went the dessert was an apple bacon crumble with frozen yogurt on top, and the apps and mains were creatively prepared and tasty.  I really love the bbq popcorn and the sparkling water they start you with too!  Ambiance is great and it is just an all around good eating experience."}
{"text":"If you want a tasty meaty lunch,  the sandwiches are good.  It is so busy in the evening,  it's hard to get in. Barque Smokehouse is a good place to take friends to with its big Roncesvalles - facing windows."}
{"text":"I would recommend this place for 2 to 4 people and would suggest making a reservation (which can be done on their website). Two of us made a reservation to go for dinner on a Thursday night.   Food: 4/5 -Shared the sampler for 2 which comes with 3 meats and 3 sides:  Meat: 1) brisket - a few pieces of brisket were a bit dry but most were tender 2) chicken thighs - tender and tasty but we found the skin was a little tough 3) back ribs (sweet heat) - the meat didn't fall off the bone but it was still very tasty and juicy  Sides: 1) brussel spouts - I thought this was going to be a healthier side but it was surprisingly heavy with the sauce that seemed cheesier as opposed to being tahini (it was still delicious) 2) herbed smashed potatoes - were a little salty but  for the most part were creamy and yummy 3) baby kale salad - was a small fresh side in contrast with the heavier sides  Dessert: - We shared the Apple Crumble Pie for Two which had 2 scoops of coffee ice cream on top. This was so delicious but so much bigger than we expected. You have to order this when you order your main meal. If you're a dessert person like me and need to try this, I would suggest having a lighter meal or lighter sides if you're going to share amongst 2 people. I think it could be shared between 4 people.  Drinks: I had the Bourbon smoked sour which wasn't great but wasn't bad.  Service: 5/5 -attentive, friendly -our meal and dessert were served really quickly after we ordered. Although we didn't feel rushed, we didn't feel that it was a place we could linger and have a conversation.  Ambiance: 4/5 -casual, cozy -every table was full but it wasn't too busy  The sampler for 2 was the right amount of food. We probably could have done without the apple crumble but I couldn't resist and would go back to share it with a few more people. I would recommend this place if you are looking for bbq and comfort food."}
{"text":"Place is rather small and a bit noisy but their eggs benny are to die for! Definitely one of the best I have tried in town. The eggs are on top of corn bread which gives this beautiful sweetness to the dish! Love the seasoning on the home fries as well.  Have definitely gone back multiple times for my eggs benny and hope to try their dinner menu soon."}
{"text":"We Googled \"family friendly restaurant in Toronto\", and we can say wholeheartedly that we were not mislead.  We are a family of 4 with a toddler and a preschooler.  The staff were very welcoming and very accommodating.  The kids loved the play dough and colouring books.  The popcorn was a huge hit with the preschooler.  The wait staff seemed to operate as a team with everyone coming by to help us out.  The Sunday night family meal was the perfect choice for us, and they even accommodated my request to sub in extra chicken (I don't eat beef/pork, the rest of fam does).  The food quality was amazing.  My husband said they were the best ribs he has ever had.  My kids were served chicken tenders, which were clearly prepared onsite and was made with only chicken breast.  My kids loved using the brushes to paint ketchup onto their tenders. The staff was very attentive and fast.  We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"After your meal at barque you will be asking yourself, \"why can't more restaurants be like this?\" Pound for pound this is the best restaurant in the city. here is why.  1: you actually get a meal. I like to eat. most restaurants in toronto dont give you a meal. you end up leaving the place wanting more. not at barque you stuff yourself and end up taking home leftovers.  2: there are enough choices that seem to meet everyones needs. I have taken a bunch of different people to barque and everyone has gone home satisfied. the sampler for two gives you nice options. it is the same price but you can try something different every time.  3: at the end of the day you are left with the bill. this is a great restaurant. so I think you have to compare it to other great restaurants. you get what you pay for and more.  4: atmosphere. I love the atmosphere. it starts with the little bowl of popcorn and it ends with homey feel. The tables have enough room to sit and have conversations.  5: quality of food. I have sat at the back and watched them prepare the food. You can see what they are cooking and you can smell it in the restaurant. they grill their meat and smoke it in house.   seriously go to barque."}
{"text":"When I used to live in Toronto, Barque was a common occurrence for us. Now that we moved out of the country, every time we come back we gotta hit this place up.  First of all, when you walk in, you're surrounded by the Roncesvalles crowd. A good mix of young people, some young families, some older couples, and everytime I've been it's been a great vibe.  You get seated, then get complimentary smoked popcorn at your table. And it's pretty amazing.  Let's talk about the food; for me, I have my go-to: start out with wings for the table (go with the dry rub, trust), then for my meal, get the sampler for one with 2 competition chicken thighs and an italian sausage.  For dessert, I always go with the pecan pie. As always, it's amazing  I've been going to Barque for over three years now, and I've never had a bad experience. The meat is cooked properly, the seasoning is to perfection and the waiters are pretty chill, and quick at the same time.  If you have kids, Teletoon Retro is usually on the televisions behind the bar, so that should keep them occupied.  Parking is free after 8 (or maybe it's 9) PM on Roncesvalles, so you don't even gotta worry about that.  All in all, if you want some good meat at a great Toronto smokehouse, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"One of the greatest smoke places we go off and on... always great wings and ribs. Cuban corn is amazing. Have seen wings a bit uncooked close to the bone but 99% is amazing. Always thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Great dinner, do the variety pack.  Go back for breakfast, becasue they really do some impressive stuff."}
{"text":"Love this place!! A bit on the expensive side but other then that everything on the menu is perfection"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night for a friend's birthday dinner and I could not have been happier.  Great food and service made for a great experience!  When you arrive you have a bucket of spicy popcorn waiting for you and you are asked if you'd like complimentary sparkling water.  This is a nice and welcome change.  I had the BBQ sampler for one - which came with brisket, ribs and a chicken thigh. All were excellent.  The meat had a really nice smokiness and was incredibly tender.  There are two types of BBQ sauce at your table and they give you a BBQ brush so taht you can apply as you see fit.  I ordered the pickle side and I'm not sure that I would order that again truthfully.  My friend had the ceasar salad and that looked a lot better.  For dessert, I had the pecan pie which was fantastically decadent!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful! Our party of 9 visited here for brunch and everyone was extremely satisfied. You can make reservations online for 6 people and under; anything over that requires a phone call.  We got a really warm genuine greeting at the front door upon arrival and also upon leaving. The place is small but quaint. And it gets very loud. Our server was gracious, helpful, and even surprised us with her willingness to stage the perfect family photo. Excellent service.  The food was amazing. I've never had ribs like this. At first, I found them different. Dry rubbed with a strong lime tang. By the second tender bite, I was hooked. They also bring over 2 additional rib sauces with a basting brush. Both excellent! Drinks are excellent also. I really enjoyed the house made sweet tea, served in a mason jar.  Would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"I'll give Barque 4 stars for the food but 0 stars for service. I've been 3 times over the past 18 months and each time the service was awful, whether or not it was busy. The staff seem genuinely uninterested in waiting tables. Maybe this is a management directive -- have fun while you're working, don't worry about the patrons."}
{"text":"Went here a few months ago and left very satisfied. Great beer selection, excellent service, beautiful decor, and very clean (smokehouses can be hit or miss with cleanliness).... And the meat.. The glorious meat. Easily the best wings I have ever had in my entire life. Brisket was very good. Sides (fries, Brussels sprouts) were delicious. Highly, highly recommend. I've been to a lot of BBQ joints in Toronto and this is one of the best."}
{"text":"Dropped in around 630 on a Saturday and only waited about 30 mins for a seat at the bar which was fine. It's always the simple things that make all the difference to me when it comes to a dining experience and the complimentary bucket of seasoned popcorn at the bar was just that. We ordered the sampler for 2 and it was delicious. The pulled pork was amongst some of the best I've had along with the competition chicken thigh and ribs. Even the \"smashed potatoes\" were excellent. The restaurant itself and the staff were all very friendly and attentive but not too attentive which is always preferred IMO. Noticed they have a patio and we will definitely return in the summer for some ribs and cold beer!"}
{"text":"Good brunch experience.  Both the service and the food were good, and it's a nice spot for a weekend brunch"}
{"text":"I finally made my way here last night and it was worth it!  Sunday nights are fixed menus that change each week and I found that given the amount of meat our group consumed last night, $25 a person was a very reasonable price.  The decor is nice and welcoming and even though it was packed, it was not too loud.  Last night's menu consisted of:  -Chicken Wings and Shrimp with a chipotle corn (I think), cauliflower soup -Beef Brisket, Greens (cooked broccoli and green beans), Pork Ribs -Ceasar Salad -Pork Sausage and Beans -Ice Cream Sandwich   Each of us drank a different beer.  I went for the Oatmeal Stout, which I found balanced the sweet, smokey flavours in the meal.  The meat (brisket and wings) was tender, juicy, smokey, sweet and delicious.  The greens were cooked, but not too cooked and the ice cream sandwich nestled in between two fresh, soft giant cookies was incredible.  Some of us had dietary \"challenges\" in that a few of us don't eat pork or shellfish.  They were more than happy to modify the meal to give us extra beef and chicken and when we asked for seconds of the brisket and greens, they gladly got us more.  Every time we asked for more napkins, water or hand wipes, they brought everything over immediately.  The staff were very friendly and I agree with other Yelpers that they were unpretentious.  Co-owner and Chef David Neinstein also came over to say hi to us and get feedback about our meal.  He took the time to speak to every table.  I did find the $3.00 charge for their special water a bit odd, but not odd enough that it bothered me.  They also have Sunday brunch, which I must check out at some point.    I was extremely impressed with Barque and think that the only challenge in the future will be getting a spot, as I think this place will be packed for a long time."}
{"text":"Barque Smoke house is the ultimate in the upper smoke house scene. I enjoy their platter for one which includes 3 types of meat and 2 side dishes. their chicken thigh is simply amazing. really like the popcorn which they serve you until your food arrives. The place always has a good vibe as soon as you walk in. Everyone working there is very courteous. I visit this place at least once or twice a month but till now I never had a single bad experience."}
{"text":"OMG! We took a friend, who's a serious carnivore, to Barque for his birthday. It was the perfect choice!   The restaurant was great at accommodating our large group of 20. They did a set menu for $35 each which was plenty of food and created a great feel for the event as large platters of delicious food was brought out for sharing throughout the night.  Everyone commented how great the food and evening was and best of all the birthday bloke was happy as he wandered about chatting while drinking a caesar rimmed with honey and bacon bits!   Take your meat eating man! He'll love it. Plus, I talked this place up so much after I'd been that even my vegetarian friends want to go. Seriously."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant and a wonderful place to bring family or friends if you don't mind a noisy atmosphere in the evenings. The sampler platters are a fantastic way to try a bit of everything. Reservations need to be made well in advance, or else expect to wait up to 2 hours for dinner."}
{"text":"I went here last night for my boyfriend's birthday with a huge crowd of 15 meat eaters! When you do a crowd of more 10 or more, you are required to do a set tasting menu, but that was fine by us!  From the very first thing to hit the table (the dry-rub chicken wings) everything was exceptional and awesome!  People were giggling with each course to hit the table.  First, we had the dry-rub wings, my personal favourite, accompanied by turkey-pheasant cassoulet (delicious), then there was an interim salad course, perhaps so we'd feel less bad about ourselves for the amazing meat orgy about to go down... Then the mains came... The dry rub ribs were the standout in my mind, and were exceptionally delicious, though the smoked chicken legs and beef brisket were both quite amazing.  Everyone had a different favourite, so I don't think that one thing was particularly better than the other.  They serve two BBQ sauces on the tables, and each person has their own brush, so you can dress up your meat as you please!  There was also dessert, but honestly, I couldn't eat it.  I was too full of delicious meats!  Apparently, you can also get a tasting menu on Sunday nights with groups of four or more.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"Honestly my fav BBQ resto in the city. It's barbecue with a culinary finesse that you don't always see with this kind of cuisine.   All I can say is these are the best wings I've ever had. And the ribs. Mouth watering. The sides are not the most imaginative but their good and the meat is the star of the show.   Atmosphere is adorable, with lots of wood, drinks served out of mason jar and the complimentary water is Q water which is awesome cause I have a pet peeve about tap water. Staff is very friendly.   Make a reservation if your going on a holiday."}
{"text":"I ordered the ribs and chicken wings for a take out lunch. The order was ready for pickup at the time I arrived. Friendly staff - cool vibe. The chicken wings were big and meaty and had a fantastic smokey flavour. Dipping sauce not necessary. But the real treat was the ribs. Coated in a thick, tasty dry rub with lots of smokey flavour. I could have finished two orders but I gave the fries (fantastic) and Caesar salad (with bacon!) a good go. Well deserved reputation on Google for best ribs in Toronto."}
{"text":"I went to Barque for dinner about three weeks ago and I'm still dreaming about the brisket!   We went without reservations, but hoped that arriving at 5:15 (it opens for dinner at 5) would mean we could get a table fairly quickly. No such luck. The hostess quoted us 1.5h wait time, but my normally-impatient boyfriend fell prey to the delicious BBQ smell and was happy to wait. We were overjoyed to get a call 45 minutes later about two available seats, and it was definitely worth the wait!   First things first: the drinks. I tried the famous bacon-rimmed Caesar and was thoroughly impressed, though it was probably a bit too much considering all the food I was about to devour. Plus it came with an asparagus stalk, and I'm all about creative Caesar accoutrements (celery need not apply).   Shared the platter for two and sampled the brisket (heavenly), beef ribs (ginormous) and chicken breast (boring choice, but super delicious) and three sides including French fries, corn on the cob and brussel sprouts. As a brussel sprout fan I was a little disappointed since I expected it to be a hot side dish and instead it was more like a cold salad. Still, the flavor was pretty good, but the texture would have been much better if warm. In any case, there was PLENTY of food for two people to share and, if you plan on ordering some appetizers, prepare to go home with either your jeans unbuttoned or leftovers.    I appreciate that Barque thinks of the little things: the buckets of popcorn and individual basting brushes that come with the cutlery are a nice touch. The two types of BBQ sauce are great, though with some choices (BRISKET), BBQ sauce is not necessary.   The vibe is relaxed and not at all pretentious. When I was there, they were playing cartoons on the TV. It's a small space crammed with as many people as they can fit, but it's surprisingly not noisy. If you're looking for a casual place with good food, this is a must-try."}
{"text":"Deee-licious, but a bit pricey. We had their infamous sample platter which comes out to $35 per person and has a good selection of their best offerings including wings, ribs, brisket and chicken with a few veggies sides. If you're good on the grill, you can make all this stuff at home. They even sell their fantastic BBQ sauce in a bottle. However, if you live in an apartment with no patio or it's the middle of an endless miserable winter, sometimes it's a nice to go to a cozy place that smells like smoked meat."}
{"text":"The wait was pretty long to seat a table for two. At the time we put our name down, we were the only people on the waiting list and it still took us about 45 mins to get seated. It wasn't even at a table, but the at bar! They at least take down cell phone numbers so we could walk around the neighbourhood or grab a drink elsewhere in the meantime. I'm starting to notice that more and more restaurants have adopted this practice and I think it's awesome! Considering the exceptionally long wait for this place however, I think next time I'll make reservations.  While seated at the bar we were offered a small bucket of popcorn that had been infused with smoky flavour. It tasted great, but was on the dry side. A little butter would have helped it out. To wash it down we ordered some wine, but immediately regretted not ordering the Barque Caesar served in a bacon rimmed glass. I'll have to come back to give it a try.  To start we ordered the duck tacos and had the option to add a fourth so we wouldn't have to fight over the extra taco. The duck taco had a great balance of flavours and textures with the pickled carrot, the sweet hoisin sauce and fatty duck. Each taco was quite small so the additional taco was a good call.  For our main we ordered the Sampler for Two and chose brisket, ribs and chicken for our meats, and fries, asparagus and cuban corn for our sides. Both the chicken and ribs were tender and delicious. The brisket on the other hand was just ok. It wasn't as tender as I was hoping it to be. I have no complaints about the sides though. The cuban corn was sweet and spicy, the asparagus was perfectly cooked and had a nice smoky flavour, and the fries were crispy and served with a delicious aioli.   The meal and service was great. I enjoyed the cozy and lively atmosphere inside and the patio outside looks inviting too. Don't forget to make reservations if you can and be prepared to wait a while otherwise."}
{"text":"Food was good but very poor value. We ordered a half rack of ribs and a half chicken. We also ordered four additional sides at $7 a piece. Only the side of fries was full.  The pasta side was only a third full. It was literally two forkfuls. The collard greens were half full.  Had the containers been filled to capacity, I would have given this restaurant 4 or 5 stars."}
{"text":"SO good!   I went here for lunch today, Had the Beef Brisket- DELICIOUS! The fries were great too. I also tried my sisters pulled chicken. Also great- very flavorful!  I am so happy that I found this place. I lived in NYC for 3 years and had my fair share of delicious meat and had yet to find anything even comparable in Toronto. That is until I discovered Barque. My eyes actually watered after i finished my meal while I thought about what my taste buds just experienced.   I haven't tried their dinner yet, but if their lunch had me in tears of joy, i can only imagine what dinner at Barque's will do to me.  I do not want to poo this out."}
{"text":"Last night I was looking forward to our dinner at barque. Unfortunately the door staff were horrible,..took forever to be seated,..one couple who was in front of us had no reso,..they asked to have a seat on the patio,..the patio had a few seats empty. When it was our turn to talk with the seating staff,.they were full of attitude saying we couldn't have the other seat on the patio.  I asked why the couple who had no reso got a seat,..they looked at each other like deer stuck in head lights. We said,..we would go somewhere else,..then the girl staff said oh wait let me seat you to the patio.  At that time I was just so put off,..I left.  10 mins later  they call me,..get my name wrong again after correcting them twice.  Said we have a patio spot for you come back,..I said you should of gave me a patio seat when I was at the restaurant,..it's 15 after my reso start. Sorry but don't argue with customers on the phone.  The worst front staff ever! Not welcoming at all."}
{"text":"Most of us, went with the sampler for one which allows you to choose 3 meats, and 2 sides.  My sister and her partner were apparently feeling agreeable and opted instead for the sampler for two (3 meats, 3 sides).  We started the evening with a few appetizers to share, so throughout the evening here is what was sampled:  Smoked Dry Rub Wings Really meaty, juicy, substantial wings, with a delicious dry rub that had a perfect amount of heat.  Smoked Miami Beef Ribs Gorgeous.  The ribs were not fatty, but rather, perfectly rendered and satisfyingly chewy.  I loved the sweet and sticky glaze.  Brisket Burnt Ends with Ginger Onion Fried Rice Probably the best dish of the whole night.  The burnt ends were meltingly tender, and coated in a deeply aromatic, sweet glaze.  What was really interesting was the large  rice \"cake\" that had been fried to crispy perfection and positioned to catch any meaty juices from above.  I loved all of the contrasting textures going on-  tender, rich meat, supple popping rice grains, crispy fried edges, and a delicious chew from the caramelized exterior. Addictive doesn't even begin to describe this dish.  Merguez Sausage, Sweet Baby Back Ribs, Brisket Wow, that sausage had the most incredible spicy flavour, and a satisfying \"snap\" in the casing.  It was just bursting with juiciness, without tasting greasy or fatty. While I really loved the heat level, most of my family found it a bit too much for them. The ribs were beautiful as well.  Tender, smokey, and just the right amount of resistance on the bone.  With a nice balance of sweet and acid, the sweet sauce was just perfect. The brisket was another clear winner.  It was perfectly seasoned, and while delicious on its own, was really special with a smear of the mustard based sauce."}
{"text":"Just visited this new establishment on Saturday, for their first official weekend. My usual expectation for new restaurants run by new restaurateurs is slow service and working out kinks. I was incredibly surprised not only by the quality of food, but the warm and efficient service.   The hostess was friendly and welcoming, not stressed out which would have been acceptable given how busy it was. Even though we had to wait a bit to get seats, I love that they take phone numbers. I was able to take a stroll down Roncesvalles to kill the time. I like the decor, with a clean look with the natural exposed brick on the outside wall, a few 4-6 seat high tables near the window, a bar with about 8-10 seats and a number of tables towards the back of the restaurant. The indoor smoker can be spotted right away near the back and it looks pretty serious, made by a company in the US called southern pride. I like the sound of that!  Sat at the bar, and the server/bartender, Alex, was super friendly and was great at highlighting what to order. They have a number of St. Ambroise beers on tap, a limited wine selection and what looked like an above average selection of scotches. To start, they provide a nice bucket of fresh popcorn with one of their spice rubs on top. Very yummy way to start my meal. They also provided their 2 signature BBQ sauces. One was a mustard/tangy South Carolina style, the other more sweet/tomato based sauce (KC Style?? I don't recall)  We started with Miami short ribs which were kindly brought to the table by chef Dave, who explained a bit about the dish and restaurant. Nice and rendered down with a good balance of smoke/sweetness. Really simple but tasty dish you don't see a lot at BBQ restaurants.  For the main, I shared the sampler platter. Its a choice of 3: Chicken Thighs, Back Ribs, Brisket, Beef Ribs. Went with the first 3 and although I am no BBQ expert, have been to many places in Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee among the usual selection in T.O(stockyards, Paul and Sandy's, drake, etc.) The brisket is hands down the best and juiciest i have had. Great smoke flavor, it barely needed the BBQ sauce. The Chicken and Ribs were also well done, but to me the brisket stood out. I read that they don't use hickory or mesquite, which I am so thrilled about as I find too many BBQ places do this and it overpowers the flavor of the meat. Had 2 sides (Cesar salad, and Cuban corn) and pecan pie for dessert. The salad was good, but nothing too special, and the corn was delicious with the spices and cheese draped on top. The pie was also extremely tasty but I prefer it served up a little warmer.   Sadly, this place will become extremely popular if this keeps up, and as much as it saddens me, the owners deserve it for taking the time to really show Toronto what good BBQ is all about."}
{"text":"Just go..you won't be sorry. All the smoked meats are great. So much flavour and creativity. Brunch is also great. Try the duck pancakes and definitely the brisket. I can't stop thinking about the brisket..."}
{"text":"You can get better BBQ at numerous places in the city. Can't fathom the popularity of a place that is, objectively, just okay, at best. The prices at dinner ($35 per person for the mixed plate, $25 for other entrees) will get your foot in the door at almost any restaurant in the city - Canoe, for instance. Let that one sink in..."}
{"text":"I met meat, and I liked it. The 99 dollar meat platter is a reasonable value, everything was delicious. I do feel like the sides on the menu need to be restructured in terms of price point and portion size. They are tiny. It'd be nice to just include a larger sharing portion and simplify things."}
{"text":"The ribs are good. The brunch is good. The fries and the BBQ sauce are good too. This place is goooood!   I don't think it's value for money though. I think for what you get, it's actually quite expensive. That puts me off. The service is friendly enough and they cater to children which is awesome. It's a treat rather than a go to though."}
{"text":"yummy, yummy in my tummy. This is my favorite restaurant in Toronto currently. The ribs are double the price compared to the southern USA, but everything was delicious and nicely presented. This is the best substitute for my rib craving in Toronto.   Barque has a great ambiance too. The place was packed on Saturday night. The beer seleciton is limited (mostly St. Ambroise), but the options were good.  desserts are also great and the staff are top notch.   I would go back here."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience this evening.  Fried green tomatoes made my mouth water dance with joy.  Platter for two was fantastic and dessert was a great finish with a Macchiato that was just right ! The only thing better was my company."}
{"text":"There's been a lot of hype of Barque lately, and since my boyfriend loves bbq, we made the trek out here. We arrived just before it opened for dinner (at 5) and there was already a line forming. I realized I forgot to call to make a reservation, but luckily we were able to get a seat (although the hostess informed us we'd have to be outta there by 7).   Our server came by and dropped off a bucket of complimentary popcorn with two types of dipping sauces - a Carolina-style mustard sauce and a Kansas-style bbq sauce. I really enjoyed the bbq sauce since it had a nice sweet flavour. The popcorn was certainly a nice change from bread typically served at restaurants.  Barque has several St. Ambroise beers on tap and they also have house sparkling water (which I've never seen served on the house at restaurants!).   As for the food, we started with the brisket poutine ($9). There was cheddar and mozzarella cheese served on top of the smoked brisket and fries. The brisket had a nice smoky flavour and was simply delicious, especially with the flavourful gravy. The fries were thin and were nothing to write home about. I wished the cheese was more incorporated into the poutine, as it was just a massive glob on top of the dish. Overall - loved the brisket and gravy, the rest of the dish was just meh.  We also started with the smoked miami ribs ($8). The serving was larger than I expected - it came served in a small skillet filled with the ribs. Although I enjoyed the sweet glaze it was covered with, I found the ribs too chewy for my liking.  For our main, we decided to share the Barque Sampler for One ($22). For this sampler, you get to choose 3 of the following (and 2 sides): competition chicken thigh, 1/3 rack of baby back ribs (spicy or rubbed), brisket and beef rib. We chose to exclude the beef rib. The chicken thigh was my favourite - it was perfectly cooked and had the most amazing sauce. We got the ribs rubbed, since the other option was spicy. I was afraid it would be too dry and I'd have to dip the ribs in the bbq sauce (from the popcorn), but they were really moist and flavourful. Another hit! Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy the brisket. Maybe my problem was that I only had one slice from the sampler... but it was really dry. I enjoyed it a lot more in the poutine (probably because it was covered in gravy...).  One of the sides we had was the Barque Caesar. Although it was just a regular caesar, it contained smoked candied bacon. I absolutely loved this! I could've eaten a plateful of this alone.  After all that food, we decided to give the homemade pecan pie (with Greg's roasted marshmallow ice cream) a try. And I'm glad we did! This pecan pie was just amazing... and the ice cream just elevated it to a \"wow\" dish. A great way to end the meal!  Overall - a few hits and a few misses, but there are definitely a few things I'd come back for."}
{"text":"Generally liked it, but the experience was soured when I left to flag a cab. Big yellow taxicab passed me by. Stopped off at the next block to pick up a white guy..."}
{"text":"Absolutely lovvveddd this place and planning to come back soon.  it's busy here and they dont take reservations past 5 or so I believe, so you may want to make a reservation in advance or be prepared to wait depending on which time you come/what day you come.  Busy which I like, nice decor and great atmosphere.  Waitress was super friendly and helpful regarding portion sizes and suggestions.  This is definately a trendier place but you see people here dining of all ages/looks.  LOVE the bucket of popcorn on the table, the spice on it was to die for and great while you are waiting for your meal.  All the meat was super flavourful, I enjoyed the sides although someone I was with thought the fries were too salty but I didn't notice.  Duck taco appetizer was awesome although one order only comes with 2 tacos so if you are with more people you may want remember that.  We came for an impromptu birthday dinner of sorts and brought our own chocolate cake with us, they were great about cutting it up and serving it to us which I thought was nice.  Will definitely come back again soon!"}
{"text":"Bought Thanksgiving dinner from Barque Smokehouse/Catering. They were super friendly and accomodating to our many requests. The food came right on time, packaged perfectly and ready to eat."}
{"text":"Yep - we've been 6 times in the last two months and this place blows my mind! The brunch is to die for... the duck pancakes and eggs benedict make me salivate just thinking about them. They also serve a wicked caesar; they actually put honey and bacon around the rim of the glass. And yes I said - BACON around the glass.  * I would like to see an 'old school pulled pork plate' with baked beans and coleslaw on the menu, but I can't complain b/c this place is perfect!  I grew up in rural Alabama and NEVER thought I'd find a decent BBQ place in Canada much less in my neighborhood... Who knew? Barque is definitely AS GOOD AS IT GETS.  ***** Also, this place is SO very kid friendly."}
{"text":"Visiting from the US, and having eaten at Rudy's and the Salt Lick in Austin, I have to say that this restaurant is fantastic.  As soon as I walked into the restaurant, I started salivating at just the smells.  Once I started eating, my salivations were justified.  The brisket stole the show, but the chicken thighs, wings, miami short ribs, and beef ribs were all excellent.  The place was bustling at 10pm on a Monday so you can tell that it is well liked, and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"My dining companion slowly swallowed her last bite of ribs, took a breath, and proclaimed, \"That was totally worth the hype.\" Yep. It's that kind of place.  Our table managed to sample most of the meats offered: merguez (yum), beef ribs (yum), pork ribs with dry rub and slow heat (yum, so I heard), chicken (yum), and the brisket (super yum). The sides of fries, asparagus, and cuban corn were also big hits, along with cocktails like a smokey bourbon sour and the \"Barque and Stormy\". Also delicious was the Barque platter: a small plate crammed with warm pita, fried crackers, falafel-like split pea fritters, guacamole, and some mystery creamy sweet sauce. Our table demolished it in about 30 seconds but  they were a great 30 seconds.   To keep this review from getting too monotonous, I'll note that the ceaser salad was a little under-dressed. OK, that's it for criticism of this otherwise incredibly enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"The seasoned fries, brisket and pulled pork were all some of the best I've ever tasted. The sauces were amazing. Great place."}
{"text":"I've been to this joint far too many times since it's opening. And it has been pretty good every time. I was there on opening evening and the food was out of this world. They were out of the dry rub ribs but the other meats more than made up for it.   The Peel and Eat shrimp are really delicious. The price point ($8) is more than reasonable. The other sides are good too. The other standout is the Ravioli. They are stuffed with magic and wrapped with pixie dust. (true story.)  I am a skinny girl with a huge appetite for ribs. Don't hate me. I am a bit of a purist and believe that dry- rub is the way to go. Kansas style drowns something good in sauce and often masks some other sins lurking underneath. But Barque's Kansas ribs are pretty good. They lack the cloying sweetness of regular ribs and the dry rub and smoke lovingly applied pre-saucing are plainly evident.   But that also brings me to the only BUT on this review. I have yet to try the dry rub rib. Which they say is their specialty. They were out the first night-ok I get it. I ordered it in a takeout pack a week later and I discovered when I got them home that they gave me the saucy ribs and not the dry ones I asked for. (Really?) After climbing out from the depths of my crushing disappointment I proceded to devour each and every piece on that rack. But they still weren't dry rub!  And then yesterday they weren't on the menu at all.   Until I try these elusive ribs I can only give them a reluctant 4 out of 5. But I plan to upgrade this review after I get in on that dry rub action in my belly. :)  I want to go to there."}
{"text":"The first thing you notice when you sit down is all the beautiful wood. The table seats are are nice solid wood but more importantly, In the kitchen there are stacks of split logs. I tried most of their meat items, honestly that's the only thing I ordered.  Their Rib (and pulled pork) game is on point. Let me tell you something about these ribs, one you get them, they have a dark exterior rubbed in a wonderful mix of spices. When you bite those ribs, they are beautifully tender but NOT soggy. This is such and important thing for good ribs, when they are too tender and \"fall off the bone\" they lose a lot of character, at that point I might as well go to Swiss chalet. After you take that first bite you will taste the beautiful smoke that has permeated the meat giving it a attractive pink hue.  The sausages are also fantastic, the texture and flavors are quite good, but honestly a sausage is just a sausage to me.  Chicken..The chicken is magic. smoked chicken is so damn good, and not many places do it like barque does.   the only thing that I did not enjoy was the beef brisket. It was honestly dry, It reminded me of packed beef that you get at a convenience store. All the smoke in the world probably would not have fixed it. Maybe Ill give it another try next time, as a lot of other yelpers seemed to enjoy it, I probably got a bad batch."}
{"text":"I have heard about this place for a while and always wanted to try it out.  Finally got a chance to visit last Saturday.   My excitement was curbed a little bit at the door after I found out there was a 1.5 hours wait.  But it shouldn't be a surprise.  After all, it is THE place to be in the Roncy Village!  We ordered the BBQ sampler for 2 which included beef ribs, half rack baby back ribs, beef brisket and 2 sides.  Guess what?  It was a HUGE disappointment!  The meat was burnt and dry.  The portions were small.  The drinks were very expensive.   And the vibe pretentious!  This restaurant is OVER-HYPED AND OVER-PRICED! If you like BBQ meat, skip this place and go to Paul and Sally's BBQ on Dundas West in the Junction area.  The best BBQ I have ever had in my entire life!"}
{"text":"Dinner at Barque was awesome. We shared the platter with Beef ribs, brisket and sausage. Caesar salad, potatoes and Cuban corn for sides. Although we got ribs, the corn was easily the messiest thing to eat (although delicious). The spiced butter was generously lathered on the cob ensuring every kernel was covered and no napkins would be wasted.  I don't think I'd get the ribs again, as they weren't that good. Kind of chewy, and not a ton of meat on there. And they used way too much rosemary in the rub, which overpowered everything else in there.  But, that brisket was top notch. Sometimes brisket is dry or bland. This was perfect brisket. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I had heard so much about Barque that I had to make my way over. We called a few days earlier but couldn't get a reservation (for a Thursday night) as they were all booked up from then til Sunday. Pretty impressive. The woman on the phone mentioned we could try coming by and getting a walk-in table so we agreed to do that.  We got there at about 8:30pm and the hostess was friendly and welcoming - though there were no tables available, she told us it could be around 30 minutes and took my mobile #. She called me within 10 mins and we quickly rushed back for our table.   Loved the popcorn w/various housemade BBQ sauces. We devoured that. Was a perfect snacking item while we got our drinks and decided what we'd eat.  I ordered the Caesar salad (which was huge, delicious, and sprinkled with candied bacon peices - quite large ones too!) and the brisket poutine (it was incredible - people at the tables around us were looking over in envy - love that). It had various cheeses and was doused in bbq sauce, like everything else we ordered.   My non-yelping friend ordered the sampler and as per her, everything was incredible. I had some of the corn she ordered which was rolled in feta and paprika and was quite literally the best corn i've ever had.   Drinks were so reasonably priced - i had makers on the rocks and each was only $6. Pretty standard but refreshing for a nicer restaurant to keep with the typical pricing.   We each had 3 drinks and plenty of food (enough that we were stuffed) and the bill was under $75. Pretty great. And our waiter was adorable and helpful. The music was perfect (they played a live Radiohead album) and the crowd was a total mix of dates, families, young and older couples and some definite lookers (in a good way).  The only thing I would say is that the menu is very limited. I probably would'nt go back too soon unless it was with friends from out of town or something. They'll have to keep updating their offerings, for sure."}
{"text":"It was awsome !! I older ribs and wings.   Staff is very friendly . I'd like to go back again!"}
{"text":"Everyone is ranting and raving about this place but I've been three times and don't agree. Great decor, great service but the one thing I loved about Barque on my first visit is no longer. On my last visit, the food seems to have shrunk and the menu changed. My beloved gigantic salad with smoke chicken is a thing of the past. My smoked shrimp and grapefruit salad was small and so was my friend's halibut dish. I can get my over-priced under-sized meal plenty of other places in the T-dot.   If you're looking for a good meal in this neighborhood, I suggest Lardon at 390 Ronces. Weird name but FANTASTIC FOOD."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great atmosphere. Had the brisket, Mac and cheese and the slaw. Slaw was alright but everything else was unreal. Also had plenty of extra sauces at the table which was a nice touch.   G had the ribs and corn and liked them both too. Friendly, quick and accommodating staff - even on a Saturday night. Decent beer selection.   Well worth it."}
{"text":"The brisket is fantastic! The southern fried chicken could use some extra spice for a bit more heat, but otherwise has great flavour."}
{"text":"On the recommendation of a friend, we had Barque cater our wedding reception and it was absolutely fantastic. The quality of the food and service went above and beyond and was perfect for our small party."}
{"text":"I volunteer for a non profit organization,  which my organization was invited by the owner (he adopted one of our hounds) to have a nice all you can eat brunch and bring our hounds which he coordinated for us on the summer Sunday of 2013; $30/ per person. Without knowing anything about this restaurant, I decided to look into it. I read good ratings and the food seems really nummy.  As a vegan, I knew i wasn't able to eat in this place cuz fear of cross contamination, but I wanted to invite 2 friends and my hubby that were huge fans of MEAT BBQ.  I know what ur thinking,\"$30/ per person, we must get really awesome stuff!\" Ya....no.....I'll list the PROS & CONS, starting with the CONS.  CONS: * Upon arrival of the time was given to us to be there, we had to wait over an hour (it was about 1hr & 30/45mins wait...i think more) because we have to wait till their regular customers leave and the staff to clean everything up, so we can be seated. It was just very odd to me that the owner who invited us sets a time where we had to wait for their regular time of operations is done before seating us and get served. Then tell us 2/3pm then 12pm....right?? * Finally seated, I already knew i wasn't going to eat, but i was more excited for the people i have invited and for the my organization cuz everyone was beyond hungry. The only meat was bacon and some scramble eggs. I've travelled and had many hotel food in my life time. From the high end to the motel 6 front desk coffee & bran muffin, which i don't even touch. I'm sorry to say, but the Barque's brunch was far from $30/per person. It felt at best about $15/per person cuz it looked like Hotel Inn Continental Complimentary Breakfast food. I didn't want to look at anyone in my group cuz i just felt like crud.  * I can't say anything about staff services cuz we ate during the time they were off. So....really...i can't say it was good service or not. It was non existence...and we're paying $30/per person?? Something is really wrong here! The only service we got was the owner which he was very friendly and the cooks that cooked our food.  * After my 3 people were done with their \"hotel continental brunch\", we sat a little bit, played with the doggies for a bit and i decided to pay for the 3 people i invited cuz i wouldn't want them to pay $30/per person for something so disappointing. I'm not damn rich, but i know how to spend my money well. While lining up to pay, i hear the owner saying to one of the staff that popped out of no where (where was he when we needed service, ay??), \"OK...just quickly give everyone their bill and get out...\" I don't know about you, but it felt like the \"nice/humble\" act to have a great organization was more a money making aspect. It just felt like it to me during that time due to the comment he made. Have that pow wow in privacy, but not out in the public. I don't need to feel like crap for paying something that i already feel very ripped off.  Total for the All You Can Eat \"Hotel Continental Brunch\" which they added gratuity (no clue where that tip going...we pretty much served ourselves): About $120 for 3 people and that's not including the drinks we had when we were waiting to eat.  PROS: * Location is great * The place is really nice, modern and great concept * Very clean place  All in all, the people i have brought were very disappointed. I'm not going to talk for the rest of the peeps from the organization, but a few i have spoke with felt very very ripped off and felt exactly how i felt of all the cons i have mentioned. Would i give it a go to this place again, NOPE."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!! Really good value. Shared the platter for two. Recvomend the brussels sprouts!"}
{"text":"We had dinner at Barque on Saturday night.  First of all, Roncesvailles has certainly come alive, and Barque is a beautiful addition.  I've had ribs at Memphis Smokehouse and Stockyards, but these ribs were exceptional.  I went for the wet ribs this time around, but will definitely go back to try their dry ones.  The sauce was tangy, and not too sweet and the fries were thin cut with the skin still on (the only way to make a quality fry). The grilled vegetables side were done to perfection. My g/f went for the cornmeal crusted halibut and  enjoyed it very much.  We're definitely going back."}
{"text":"Barque (Bark), the newish BBQ restaurant in Roncesvalles (which happens to be in the building that my Polish extended family own) has open to critical acclaim. But is it as good as everyone says?  It is. Probably better than you can imagine.   Arrived on a Friday night early (6pm) sans reservation. We tried to get one, but were told by a surly hostess that they were full. Decided to try anyways. Walked up to the hostess desk, asked about a table, and were told it would be at least two hours (somewhat rudely). The hostess was super young, like maybe 18, and I could tell it was likely her first part-time job. Probably not the greatest strategy for a newly opened, super in-demand popular restaurant. There is a way to tell paying customers who want to eat in your restaurant that they have to wait, her tone/body language and delivery was not the way. It was kind of smug.  Regardless we put down our names and decided to walk down Roncesvalles. About five minutes away we called Local Kitchen to see if they had a table, we didn't see the worth in waiting two hours, and our experience at the hostess desk turned us off. Continued down Roncey and received a call 5 minutes later from....Barque. A table had miraculously opened up (no more than 15 minutes from when we were told we'd have to wait 2 hours). Feeling lucky, we walked back.  And I'm glad we did. Because the food and service once we sat down made up for our earlier issue.   Started with their housemade BBQ popcorn (which is brought out in a tiny tin bucket). Ordered drinks, I stuck to beer, my dining companion went for their Cesear ($10), which comes rimmed with candied bacon. It was pretty delicious.   For a starter we shared one of the specials, a tomato, arugula, smoked peach, caprese salad ($9). To die for. The peaches were smoky, sweet, with just a hint of char. I've been making BBQ'ed peaches at home ever since.  For our main we decided to go with the BBQ sampler for two ($38). This is the greatest deal on the menu, you get to choose three out of four meats and three sides. We chose: beef brisket, beef ribs & baby back ribs for our BBQ, and the pickle plate, fries and cuban corn for our sides. The beef brisket was succulent, juicy, a bit fatty and sooo delicious. I could have eaten pounds of it. The beef ribs were melt-off-the-bone, so tasty. Best ribs I have ever had in Toronto. The baby back ribs were equally good, but my least favourite of all the meat, basically due to the fact that we left them till last and they were kinda cold. Sides were all excellent, the corn was similar to Cafe Habana's Cuban corn (see my review) but not as tasty. The fries were also very good, but the clear winner was the pickle plate (which according to our server is their least popular side). Get it, you won't be sorry.  No dessert, we could barely walk after our meal.   Just a note on service: our server was amazing, super casual yet professional, prompt with all requests and even made time for small talk about the menu. A+  Barque is now my favourite BBQ restaurant in the city. It smokes Stockyards (I likely won't ever bother going back). Try it now, if you can get a reservation :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend really wanted to go here but I wasn't impressed especially because of all the rave reviews. Waiting for our 5pm dinner reservation, saw a few of the cooks (young) smoking outside, which for some reason turned me off a bit. The restaurant seems to be run by 20 somethings.    When you sit down there's a bowl of seasoned popcorn which tasted a bit stale. You also have the option of still or sparkling water on the house.   We ordered the platter for two which comes with 3 meats and 3 sides, and a Pepsi. We ordered the brisket, ribs, and chicken, and asparagus, fries, and potato salad. When it arrived at our table, I was disappointed by how small the portions were. And if I remember correctly the platter for two (3 meats, 3 sides) is the same offered for one. But I could be wrong, it happens from time to time. The asparagus looked like shriveled up string beans, the potato salad had no flavor, the fries were overly seasoned and salty, I found 2 hairs on my plate, when I saw the first one I just took it off and let it go because it was just on the plate where there was no food, but then I found another one wrapped around an asparagus and I didn't feel like complaining that day.  I just wanted to finish up and leave.   The table of 3 adults next to us ordered the larger platter for $110 and they definitely had more food, AND their asparagus looked like asparagus.  So I guess it was just my unlucky day.  Had to wait longer than necessary for the bill which the server apologized for.  Bill came to about $62 and left $72.  I will not be coming back or recommending.  I should have gone to Montana's like I wanted to."}
{"text":"I frequented this restaurant last night and was very impressed. Their brisket was tender and succulent  where their chorizo sausage exuded great flavours. Impressive beer selection however icing on the cake was by far the pecan pie & cinnamon ice-cream!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and made reservations both times a month in advance. I would recommend making reservations ahead of time and definitely not close to closing time as I've noticed they tend to run out of the more popular items.   Smoked Wings (Dry Rub) - I am a huge fan of the dry rub! juicy wings and great rub. I also tried the sweet heat and wasn't a big fan. Definitely go for the dry rub.   Sampler for Two - I've had the brisket, italian sausage, chicken thighs and baby back ribs. I would highly recommend the brisket and baby back ribs. Both were amazing.  The chicken thighs were also very juicy and fell off the bone. Only thing that was average was the italian sausage, it was just okay.   The sides were pretty standard. I enjoyed the fries and thought they were the best side dish they had to offer. Smoked asparagus and smoked cauliflower were also delicious."}
{"text":"Where is the beef?  It left Wendy's a while ago (horrible 80's joke I know, I know...) but this, this I tell you is where it is now.    We did the sunday dinner which is the family night dinner at this place.  It's a preset menu that they post on their website so that you know just what it is that you are getting into.  Well I got into it and absolutely loved it.  The meats that we had, (BBQ pork and ribs) were fall off the bone great.  As someone who does love it saucy (including the horrible joke above) , they had an additional brush with sauce so I could slather my food the way I wanted it.   I knew I was doing a good job since it was all over my fingers and my napkin was getting to the colour of the sauce as well.  Even their chicken and salad that day were both delicious, and finished it off with an black forest ice cream shake!    Will be back with an appropriate appetite for sure!"}
{"text":"Chicken wings - very good, crispy and well seasoned Sausages - good Ribs - just ok, don't understand all the hype Fries - wayyyy too salty !!! Although I love eating salty food, this was just inedible, especially as all the other dishes were already very salty. I thought the flavors were not balanced enough.  Other than that, service was very good, efficient, fast and pleasant."}
{"text":"4/5! Amazing BBQ ribs! Must try! I highly recommend this place for people who are willing to venture outside of the downtown core for really good BBQ! Make sure you come with an appetite cause the portions are very filling."}
{"text":"Alright BBQ compare to Electric Mud. My friend and I ordered ribs, brisket, BBQ chicken, Mac &  cheese, and dry wings. The only memorable item was the wings."}
{"text":"If you are looking to do something fun wt your date go to barque. The food is  amazing and the vibe of the place is good.   I would not recommend the dessert."}
{"text":"If you like the traditional southern style smokehouses with big flavour, big portions, and rough around the edges, then this place is not for you. If you like variations on the smokehouse theme with fancier presentation but milder taste, then you will love this place.It really depends what kind of smokehouse you want. Smoked anything is the new fashion food trend and it seems everybody and their brother wants to open a smokehouse.   The staff were really friendly and the place is hip. Maybe too hip. Overall I found the food a bit bland and it just failed to satisfy the smoke lover in me. The \"Cuban corn\" was not very spicy, the \"Briskett\" was dry and came across more like cold cuts than something that had been smoked (the brisket at Camel is hard to beat), and the \"Pulled Pork\" was not really shredded pork (sorry it has to be to be called that) it it was really one of the blandest PP sandwiches I have seen. That sampling was enough to convince me to return if I was in the area and wanted OK food but not worth a special trip. Instead I would go to Lou Dawgs, The Stockyard, or even Camel (although I find their PP a bit sweet). A good, average, place.   I would say that the best example of what Barque is trying to be is Ottawa's \"The Smoque Shack\" which combines modern style with authentic smoked flavours and the ability to mix and match food combinations as samplers. I think that Barque could learn from them a bit."}
{"text":"We tried takeout from this place. We ordered the following items:  - chicken fingers Cooked a bit too long. Were crispy but harder than they should be  - dry rub ribs Quite tasty. Not the best ribs ever but pretty good.  - brisket This was the highlight of the meal. Nice and juicy with just the right amount of tenderness  - fries They had a great seasoning. Since it was takeout, they were a bit soggy by the time we got home. But at the restaurant this would be great. At home, they were just good.  - squash and brussel sprouts This was disappointing. The flavor was ok, but the amount of side they gave us was laughable. For $5 we got about a cup of the side."}
{"text":"Ribs with both sauces are pretty good! Large caesar salad needs two servings of dressing instead of the given one. Otherwise great!"}
{"text":"Great pulled pork sandwich, tasted fresh and homemade, nice and smokey. Now if they could only serve these on the street. Way to go Barque I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, the sparkling water, the popcorn, and the everything! Amazing smoked platter and surprising salmon I'll try next time!"}
{"text":"As someone from the southern US, who knows and eats bbq/smoked meats, I wasn't impressed.  The wet ribs were decent but the meal wth $100 for 2 people (and one of us even chose a la carte).  So, if your fine paying $100, (I know it's Toronto and foods expensive) for a few pork ribs that aren't anything special then give it a try-otherwise I wouldn't.  I'm disappointed as I wanted it to be better."}
{"text":"Went here for my boyfriends birthday and loved it. we got the sharing platter 3 meats and 3 sides everything was delicious , i especially liked how you had your own sauce to add to the meat.  The place was packed on a Monday night so i would suggest making a reservation even though they accept walk ins or you might get stuck sitting at the bar. Great food, good service, and nice casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place and I had high expectations.  The only good thing was their wings. The ribs were lukewarm and overdone. The potato salad tasted like paper with dill, no seasoning whatsoever. The fries were over seasoned to a point that having a few was all that I can handle.    Electric Mud bbq is way better than this place. At one point I said to myself I wish I was eating Swiss Chalet ribs."}
{"text":"Having been to over 20 places for wings and other bbq houses I must say hands down this place was the best. Our server was concise, courteous and made sure everything was a pleasant experience. We got the BBQ sampler and while it was pricey, definitely worth it."}
{"text":"We've been to Barque once before, a year or so ago. We'd been heading to The Ace down the street, found their waiting list too long, and ventured up to Barque. The first time turned into a great evening at the bar with delicious food and a bartender who made us feel very at home.  Yesterday, same situation. The Ace's waiting list for brunch was too long. We walked into Barque and from beginning to end had excellent service in a casual, comfortable environment.  Great beers on tap, incredible ribs, delicious (maybe slightly dry) brisket, yummy fries and a horseradish dipping sauce I couldn't get enough of. Topped it off with fantastic coffee and a scrumptious apple cinnamon scone.   The ribs were indeed the highlight but we really couldn't find fault with anything. So good."}
{"text":"Dined at barque a few times since moving to the area. This is a great place to come and share a bunch of dishes. One of my favourite bbq joints in the city.   Sunday dinner they have a great special that includes a variety of meat and side dishes. I recently visited for lunch and they have a good options too. Next is brunch!"}
{"text":"Great sides, okay BBQ.  Ordered, sampler for 2 which has your choice of 3 meats and 3 sides.  We chose beef brisket, chicken and baby back ribs along with brussel sprouts, mashed potatoes and salad.  Service was good.  No issues here, prompted swapped out empty water jugs, came to ask how things were, food came out quickly.  Atmosphere is a bit of a miss in my option.  The place isn't very big, so you will be seated pretty cozily with your neighbors.  Due to the low ceiling and lack of soundproofing?  The restaurants gets loud really quickly and you have to work at listening to your group who is sitting just across from you.  I'm confused based on reviews I've read and based on my friend's review of the place.  We came here because my friend really liked the place and it was on our list of places to try.  In the end, we were a bit disappointed.  The ribs weren't fall off the bone and was a bit on the smaller side, the brisket was dry (that's why they give you sauce), but we enjoyed how moist the chicken was.  All the sides we thought were excellent.  I probably won't be coming back unless it was for the sides unless I'm told that the other meat options are better."}
{"text":"Sadly, Barque comes nowhere near what it purports to be.  Having just returned from a trip to Texas I decided to give it a go, as I was jones-ing for some smoked goodness.  I had the sampler for two, which I split with my wife, with sides of veggies, and fries.  The ribs were stupidly chewy. No 'fall off the bone' here. I've had more enjoyment from a $4. bag of beef jerky. They weren't even smoked all the way through. Same with the sausages. Not smoked through enough. If I want the joy of a real Italian sausage in all its glory, I'll got to an Italian joint, or cook 'em at home.  The chicken was good. Smoked through, and still quite juicy.  The fries were outrageously overloaded with salt. I mean, how can you botch fries? How hard can it be? Toss 'em in the fryer, and sprinkle a pinch of salt on 'em. It ain't rocket science..... I love salty foods, but even those fries were too much.  Now for the vegetables. They were crisp, and fresh, as they should be, but some genius that plans out the menu decided that they would be better if they were 'seasoned' with sesame oil.   WRONG. You're not an Asian restaurant, you're a smoke house. Don't get cute.... Tasting sesame oil in conjunction with smoked meat doesn't work.  One of the few things that was positive, was the service. The server was prompt, and engaging, even though she was quite busy."}
{"text":"Finally had a meal at Barque. It a small noisy place but fun and trendy. I should have listened to the Yelp reviews! I love ribs but the O'Bama ribs I had were too dry. I like my ribs nice and tender fall of the bone.... As most reviewers say, you should decide have the sampler. It gives you the choice of 3 meats. Many of my friends had it and their meats (e.g.Chicken, brisket) seemed much more tender.  I'd go again but for the sampler."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in T.O. I think we tried everything on the menu, highlights were corn, caprese salad, half chicken, saucier ribs, brisket, brisket poutine, shrimp, wings, peach cobbler and pecan pie.  No suggestions for improvement.  The whole experience was amazing!!! Service, atmosphere, food, price were all exactly right!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place for a while. So finally had the chance to go. At first I was displeased about the service. They lost my reservation. How does that happen? But luckily there wasn't that much people there, so it was a 30 minute wait. We went by Dizzy's next door and grabbed a drink while we waited  The service from the server was good and well planned. I started with the duck tacos and lamb ribs for apps. The duck was dry, but well flavored. The duck skin adds good crunch. There was sauce on the tabke, I'm assuming its their house sauce. Didn't really get to try it but yeah I think it would of been wise to try it on the duck. The lamb ribs... Wow. That's it. It was that amazing. Wanted to order more but I wanted to try their sample platter and soo... Next time ;)   The sampler platter is a good choice to try. You get a good range of choices and have a chance to experience a full palate of flavours. Their walnut salad is very refreshing and should of saved it for the end.lol the sweet patatoe was spiced up well and has a good kick of heat. Their brisket is a must try if your a beef lover. Their churios sausage delivers a punch in strong flavors, If you don't like cumin. Stay away.lol but I liked it. Their pork ribs were disappointing... Very dry and hard. I don't mind a crust on my ribs but I need my meat to be moist. I really wanted to try the beef ribs but unfortunately there were sold out :@  Overall. This is place was good. Had a great time and enjoyed most of the food. I will definitely go again to try out the beef ribs and have a lot more of the lamb.lol definitely a 4 star place :) check it out!"}
{"text":"Woah. The brunch is was UNBELIEVABLE! The pulled pork was live changing. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Who knew brussel sprouts could be heavenly! And left overs were mouthwateringly good even day after!  Huge servings for two share plates!  Great atmosphere and super nice waiter on staff."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, the lattes are yummy and the rib plate is really fantastic. I really enjoyed this restaurant. I've gone for both lunch/breakfast and both meals were equally great."}
{"text":"Tender, juicy meats and lovely side dishes. Great for sharing and trying a variety of well prepared meats. Relax vibe. Keep it up."}
{"text":"Excellent, Excellent BBQ place, a little pricey but given the demand it is what it is. Only complaint is the very limited seating."}
{"text":"I checked out Barque twice now and am happy to report that  Roncesvalles has another new solid restaurant!   The first time I was here my DCs and I started with an order of smoked chicken wings. I was originally skeptical of this choice as frankly I'm not a huge wing guy, but the wings were perfectly smokey and spicy and way better than the more typical deep fried Buffalonian counterparts. My only criticism was that they were slightly greasy which is understandable given that they would have been cooked low and slow (which is not ideal for rendering fat).    On both of the occasions that I was there my group chose to split the sampler platters as our main courses and I feel that this is frankly the best choice if you and your DCs want to try most of the menu in one visit.   Via these sampler orders we tried the beef brisket, \"competition\" chicken thighs, dry rubbed baby back ribs and Flintstone sized beef ribs. The samplers also came with a choice of sides of which we tried  smoked asparagus, fries, pickled vegetables, and Cuban corn (cut in half).   First up - the brisket is amazing and is definitely the menu item that was the closest to mastery at this place. The meat was melt-in your mouth tender and not even a little bit dry. This was key as I have found that a lot of other briskets I have tried in Toronto have slathered themselves in overly sweet BBQ sauce and called it a day. I think one of the owners best summed it up in a recent G & M article when he said his brisket was Montreal smoked meat meets Texas BBQ. While I would say that this is a fair assessment, it is definitely more BBQ than deli (noting that if you want this same kind of idea, but prefer to skew towards the deli direction, you should undoubtedly try Caplansky's).   The back ribs were very good flavour wise as they had a deep but not overdone smokiness, but I did find them to be slightly dry. I would still give the \"best ribs in town\" award to the Stockyards although I think Barque's ribs have potential.    The beef ribs were great too, and the chef is clearly using some well aged beef here as there was flavour (and tenderness) to spare.   The competition chicken was a worthy pick of the sampler and should not be passed over for some of the other more glamourous choices. Also, the chef gets bonus points for not using white meat here (noting however that there are white meat chicken tenders on the menu which I'll assume is for kids and give the benefit of the doubt). If you've read my Romados review, you'll know why white meat is unacceptable.  The sides were all good but the two of note were the Cuban corn (quite spicy) and the pickled vegetables (which were delicious, well balanced and served as a good way to cut through the grease of the meat).   Dessert-wise I have tried the beignets (done well but not a great way to finish off the meal for some reason), the pecan pie with Gregg's roasted marshmallow ice cream (unbelievable, and I don't even like pecan pie), and a deconstructed version of a peach crumble (which was topped with a ginger cream and made me want to lick the plate).   The drinks menu is very solid and includes a mint julep,  (made with quality bourbon but ever so slightly oversweetened), the candied bacon caesar (perfectly spiced and comes with a pickled green bean!) and the full range of Macauslan/Griffon draught beers.  Price-wise, expect to pay about $40-$50 per person if you intend to get drinks and desserts with your meal, which although slightly expensive for BBQ, is totally worth it.  As a final verdict on where this place stands in the Toronto BBQ rankings, I would say that it's too close to call between Barque and Stockyards, with both places having different enough menus that there need not be a definite winner.  Go check barque out."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I selected the $39/per person smoker's choice menu, which includes a salad, wings, platter of assorted meats, fries, and dessert. Everything was to share, except for the dessert.   The salad was drenched in buttermilk dressing, but still acceptable. Smoked wings were flavorful and crispy. The side collard greens was meh, I've had better. BBQ fries were good. The portion of the meat platter was definitely too small as my boyfriend and I shared 2 pieces of baby back ribs, a little scoop of pulled pork, a few thin slices of beef brisket, and two pieces of BBQ chicken. Besides that, the platter was cold when it was served to us.   Service was horrible, our server completely ignored our table and ended up serving us the wrong desserts, just to realize it a minute later and ended up taking it back."}
{"text":"My fave restaurant in the world! Best food, best service! They always remember me, probably because I come here all the time. Ribs, chicken wings are delish! Also the worlds best french fries. We drive in from oakville whenever we get the chance. It's worth the drive to Roncy!"}
{"text":"It's not a bad place. The place is well clean and service is excellent. Unfortunately, the food was okay only and it didn't have much food choice for younger children, as they all had nice kicks if spice. Price wasn't cheap either."}
{"text":"Very very interesting taste. Their bbq is on another level. If you're looking for a completely new experience, I think you should give this place a try. I ended up spending quite a bit of money of that family platter (I think that's what it was called), and some beer. But I did end up going back to this place a few times already.  Their wings were amazing. Some sort of really unique sauce. I'm trying to make that stuff at home, obviously.. it's not working out well haha.  Give it a try. I imagine people will be quite opinionated with this place (in terms of their taste).  Service was great. I'm not too crazy on rating a restaurant's service though.. I'm all about the taste. =)"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Saturday.  I have heard many great things about this place and I was disappointed that it fell short of my expectations (which were admittedly, high). But overall, it was still okay. I won't be in a hurry to return here.  I had the cheesey french toast. I think the consensus for everyone was that their dishes were just okay... our table ordered the pork belly tacos, brisket benny, scrambled eggs, and french toast.  The service was good."}
{"text":"It was excellent! Came here on Canada Day, and made a reservation 3 days in advance. Make sure you make a reservation though as they seemed to have quite a few.  Shared the Smoked Platter, which was chef's choice. It included the Smoked Wings (Dry Rub) Holy they were great!! Delicious.  Also had the greens, corn, smoked chicken, smoked brisket and ribs. Everything was amazing. Ribs in particular were again so good!  I believe they have take out as well.  We got served fast! They had an excellent selection of drinks. ( On tap was St. Ambriose only but they had wines, cocktails etc as well)  Yum!!"}
{"text":"After reading that this is one of the best new brunch places of 2011, we decided to try it out this weekend.  We arrived at about 12:30 pm on Sunday, and had to wait about 10 minutes to get a table for 2.  The host was friendly and efficent, and kept us updated on how long the wait would be.   Hubby and I were both very happy with our meals - I had the french toast, which comes with honey ricotta, candied almonds, and smoked candied bacon bits (very few, but those that I had were good).  I did have to request some extra syrup though, as there are 3 big pieces of french toast, and while they drizzle the syrup on for you, the bottom 2 pieces didn't really get the syrup and needed the moisture.  He had the eggs benny, which is a bit unique since it's on cornbread and is served with smoked brisket.  He loved it.  My latte and his coffee were good, and we were both happy to have a carafe of water on the table, rather than having to wait for refills.    The servers were friendly.  Ours also put in a good sales pitch, luring us with the dinner menu - we assured her we'd be back soon to try it.    The atmosphere was relaxed, casual, trendy, and family-friendly while still young and hip.    We will return!"}
{"text":"Top 3 Bbq places I have ever eaten at. The service was amazing. Ribs were incredible. The only thing that could have been better is if I didn't get full so fast and I didn't have to wait an hour."}
{"text":"When you walk you immediately notice the aroma of dry rubs, BBQ sauce and smoking meat.  The ambience is relaxed and urban. The location isn't very big and it fills up quick.  From Thursday evening right through until Monday getting in it even getting a reservation is close to impossible.  The average wait time for walk-ins is 45 minutes to an hour for a table. And no, there isn't room at the bar to wait for your table because it's packed there as well!  I went for lunch this week at Barque and it's much more laid back and less busy.  The waitstaff is friendly and helpful.  The starter salads are a nice size and can be a meal or perfect to share for two.  Their Bacon Bit Caesar was delicious!!! For those that aren't too keen on ribs and pulled pork they also have trout and salmon and tilapia on the menu, however not all offered at the same time.  If you want to try this place out without dying of hunger at the door while waiting for a table, may I suggest going for lunch first.  We weren't rushed and had our drinks and our meals and were done in 40 mins.  Not bad at all!!"}
{"text":"Service was great, and food was awesome. The smoked asparagus was delicious, and the chicken was remarkable.   Wish I had been able to justify eating the brisket and/or ribs that day, but the sauces, the sides, and the atmosphere were amazing."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for brunch around 1 pm.  The place was packed but we lucked out and got a seat on the patio.  It was a little chilly but they had heat lamps going, (still a little cold for me but it was tolerable)  We went there based on all the positive Yelp reviews and we were VERY happy.  Our server was very friendly and attentive.  A word of warning, If you are going there STARVING do order a little something before your main meal.  (We ordered  coffee and beer but it wasn't enough)  It took about 25 or so minutes before we got our food as it was really really busy.   I had the omelette with the smoked salmon and it came with home fries and a side salad, and some bland buttered Challah bread.  It was good but I would probably just order the ribs next time.   My boyfriend ordered the ribs and fries.  They were delicious and a bit spicy and came with the same side salad as my eggs.  ***We noticed other dishes that were being served and they looked REALLY GOOD.  I think one was the Eggs Benedict with Cornbread, and others had pancakes that looked really good too.***  All in all this place is definitely a must try and we will go back and try them for dinner.  Will definitely make reservation in advance as our serve suggested.     It also smells nice and smokey....YUMMM!"}
{"text":"We came here on the weekend and received amazing food and service. We were greeted by friendly staff, spiced popcorn on the table and complimentary sparkling water.  We started off with the Barque Bloody Ceasar - a great ceasar but the real selling point was that it was rimmed in candied bacon...yum!   We had the smokers choice which was a chef's selection of the most popular meats. The started was 1lb of their smoked wings in a lemon pepper rub....amazing!! The most hearty juicy wings I've ever had. The starter also included an arugula salad with watermelon and some kind of deep fried cheese which was unreal.  The main course included smoked brisket, chicken thighs and ribs. Complimented perfectly by their two bbq sauces, these meats were really something. They came served with grilled asparagus and the most amazing roasted white & sweet potatoes. Everything was cooked perfectly and had beautiful flavor.  To top it all off we had a chocolate cupcake filled with dark chocolate filling with a caramel frosting. Very rich, very delicious.   Everything came out hot, fast and perfectly cooked. So much food!! Definitely make reservations as it was consistently busy even when we left at 10:30pm. This place is highly recommended for an meat/BBQ lovers!!"}
{"text":"Just left Barque and feeling so full and satisfied. This is the second time I've been here - the first was with clients who were in town from LA and this time with my boyfriend.  The food is absolutely amazing - you have to try the dry rub wings... the consensus is always that they are the best wings you will ever have.   My first time here 4 of us shared two of the sampler platters for 2. You get a ton of food and get to try the popular brisket, baby back ribs and beef ribs.  I also recommend the creamed cauliflower and brussels sprouts with maple squash.  This time we chose a bunch of menu items to share - wings, smoked duck tacos (delicious) and the classic 1/2 rack of baby back ribs. Got the cauliflower again plus a caeser salad. Everything was amazing!  My last note is that the spiced popcorn is a nice touch and the homemade iced tea topped off an already perfect meal!   In addition to all the great food is awesome service and the food comes out fast. It's hard to get a table on a Friday or Saturday night but if you're lucky you can walk in and get a spot at the bar which is where we sat tonight.   Great spot! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The dinner is fantastic, cocktails are groovy, and ambience is warm and welcoming. With that being said, DO NOT OVERLOOK THE BRUNCH! Without question, the Duck Pancakes are the star of the show. I would recommend arriving early (especially with larger parties), but don't stress too much; after arriving with a party of 8 (plus two young children), we were graciously seated within 30 minutes.   The candied bacon rimmed Ceasar must be noted as well... Sunday mornings never felt so good! I will continue to go back, and I'm sure you will as well."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing and a gluten free haven. The meal started off well as they brought out a pail of complimentary bbq seasoned popcorn to the table and offered complimentary sparkling water. There is a separate deep fryer for gluten free fries, and all their sauces and sides (other than obvious sources of gluten like Mac and cheese) were gluten free. Our waiter was so friendly and helped us select a great combination of meats for our dinner. We shared brisket and a chicken platter which came with fries and coleslaw. Can't wait to go back and tell my friends to as well"}
{"text":"I've been to Barque a number of times, each time enjoying my meal, as did my friends.  Sometimes the beef ribs were a bit on the dry side, brisket is usually great.  Did take out once in the middle of the week, and was disappointed that I had to wait 40 min for my order. This will not stop me from going back because I do enjoy my Barque (but I am thinking about it), but I was very disappointed with the element of the customer service.  When you have a table larger than 6, you can only book over the phone with the restaurant.  I called not once, twice but three times, to try and book my friend's  bday dinner  over 2 weeks ahead, a larger group, yes, so hostess could not answer if I could be accommodated, but was told the manager would call me back and I was promised a phone call the first and second time I called - did I get a phone call? unfortunately no, and not after I left a voicemail either on my 3rd call.  All I wanted was a courtesy of a phone call back, so not too pleased with the level of service."}
{"text":"A carnivores dream! It was everything I expected. I used a deal we got from travelzoo and I will be definitely going back."}
{"text":"Bar-q?  Or Bark?  Still don't know how to pronounce it.  Shrug.  We were there for late night drinks and snacks, being in the area for an art gallery thingie.    *Spinach salad with pulled chicken was as expected, but the chicken needed more smoke and one piece of the chicken had a seriously large piece of goose bump skin hanging off of it.    *Chicken tenders were delicious-super crispy and salty on the outside, and tender white meat on the inside.    *Wings were ok, but again we felt it needed more smoke.    *Side ribs were tooooo sweet, and it ended up being the only item we didn't finish.    *Beignets were not crispy enough on the outside, but the sauce you dip it in was delicious; tangy, sweet and gooey.   I'd go back if I were in the area again, but I'd definitely ask for rec's instead of ordering on our own."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. I really really wish I lived closer. So yummy.  The platter for two is excellent value ($42), they do takeout, their branding is great, the people are friendly, their chicken fingers were an fantastic surprise. Love it."}
{"text":"Chicken is really good, the Ribs are pretty good (but not the best)."}
{"text":"This is an extremely popular and busy resto. So let me suggest a couple of things arrive as close to 5pm as possible as a walk in or make reservations in advance. I have been to many barbeque and smoke houses in the States but nothing really came close in Toronto. This is place is gets it \"RIGHT\".  Generous, tasty, high quality proteins that are really well prepared.   The wines, and drinks are at a very accessible pricing point and their strawberry consomme with sparkling wine was a very solid addition to the meal. The sides are excellent, particularly the smoked asparagus.  Well Done!  Their beef tenderloin put some of the finest steak houses in the city to shame, very well prepared."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere. I love the cartoons and popcorn. Food seems a little slow coming out sometimes but I think that is because they are always so busy. If you don't have reservations, your chances of getting a seat are pretty low. I've been able to sit at the bar 2 out of 3 times I've tried, and that's been fine.   Service is good, but they are always understandably busy."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've had several great meals here (particularly the smoked duck pancakes). If you're looking for a lighter meal I would recommend coming for brunch or lunch since they have many smaller options, as opposed to mixed bbq platters. Make a reservation ahead of time and definitely try the chicken wings if you plan on coming!"}
{"text":"The real meat is in the marketing...  What I mean is, the presentation of the food and the experience of being at a trendy new spot taste better then what is on your plate. The food is good, but doesn't add up to the 'buck.'  That said, it is still a fun spot and I had a good experience overall. It's worth trying once. I recommend for a group of 4: - double date - family  - group of friends  *if you go at prime dinner time, expect at 45min-1hr wait ** they do take reservations, but book a few days in advance"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Toronto. The brisket was out of this world. Also really liked the charred brussel sproats. My only regret is that I waited so long to try this place. Wait staff are wonderful."}
{"text":"I wanted to love it, but kids meal ribs were dry with only one side.  The brisket I ordered was cold and dry.  The chicken was great.  Overall under impressed especially because of the hype."}
{"text":"My husband planned my birthday dinner....and we end up at Barque. When he first told me about this place, I wasn't overly impressed. BUT I'm open to try new place. We were a large group of  10, so,they gave  us a pre-fixed menu, which was a great idea. As soon as we were seated, they just start bring out food...soup, fries, some sort of yummy bread, chicken wings, ribs, more chickens, corns, briskets. And, we finish with roasted marshmellow ice cream and pecan pie. Ah, yes, I gained 8 lbs that night...and it was worth it. My Best birthday this year!"}
{"text":"I had visited the restaurant for the first time last night with my boyfriend for dinner. We had arrived around 8 pm and the restaurant was packed but we were greeted by the cheerful hostess at the front. She was super friendly and had told us that the wait for the next available table for two would be about an approximate 1 to 1 1/2 hour wait. Luckily there was a David's Tea not too far down from the restaurant so we were able to grab some tea and keep busy for about an hour. After an hour, we returned back to the restaurant and was told it would be another 45 minutes. Ultimately, we were seated by 10 pm (totalling a 2 hour wait).   Once seated, you automatically get a \"neighbourhood\" feel of the restaurant which is nice. The waitress had come to our table not too long after being seated. All the staff in the restaurant were super friendly!You're offered a choice of sparkling or still water and there is a little bowl of popcorn available to you at your table. We had ordered the sampler for two, this gives you the choice of choosing 3 meat options and 3 sides (we had chosen the beef ribs, baby back ribs, chicken, fries, coleslaw and penne) which was $45. The food arrived to our table pretty quickly. Overall, the food was delicious but the ribs were a tad bit on the dry side and the penne was bland. My only regret was not getting the brisket! For dessert, we had shared the sticky pudding with vanilla gelato and strawberries, which was $9. The cake was tender and delicious but the gelato was a little on the stingy side.  If you're planning to go, I recommend making a reservation ahead of time or else you'll be stuck waiting for more then half an hour for a table."}
{"text":"Very pretentious place. It's just BBQ for goodness sake! The food is tasty but overpriced and the alla carte portions were a bit small. $12 for a grilled cheese for our daughter?? Are you kidding me? The fries they gave her were the overcooked dregs left over from under the heat lamp. Not impressed. They really don't want families with kids eating here. This is definitely an \"urban hipster\" kind of place. The service was fine. Once was enough, though. If asked, I will recommend that people try another restaurant in the area. Maybe try the Swiss Chalet up Keele. Their ribs are just as sweet and the ambience just as noisy!"}
{"text":"Everything about my experience was ok. Nothing more nothing less. I really expected the ribs and brisket to wow me but again they were just ok. For the money spent I won't be rushing back as i think there are better options in the city."}
{"text":"The mac n cheese was bland. The ribs were average. The poutine was lacking cheese curds and the Cajun spice on the fries complicated a classic pulled pork poutine. Good news is the pecan pie was delicious and a good size. Three stars for the good service."}
{"text":"This spot is good but not great. I guess it's not fair to compare this place to BBQ in the states, but really what's so hard? Good beer though and a great location."}
{"text":"A go-to place if you like your protein smokey.  Barque Smokehouse  is barbecue done right with a sampling of everything one can ask for or want to eat.  I've been here for both dinners and brunches and never left disappointed or hungry.  The only issue can be the wait at times during the peak eating times and reservations are very limited.  Decor is simple and the wall of sauces will just leave you wanting to take some home.  Service always friendly and welcoming, plus I believe the best seats in the house is at the bar.  Bartender will have you laughing and wanting to order more drinks (especially the caesars) because it's that good.  I love their caesars made with candied bacon rim....absolutely delish!  And depending on the day you come you can have a surprise inside the drink, i.e. pickled asparagus, pepperette, pickled bean etc.  For first timers - the sampler platter for dinner is the best bet as it comes with choices of brisket, pulled pork, beef ribs, chicken, baby back ribs and sides.  Depending on how many people in the group the number of choices you can select varies.  I love the ribs here since they're the fall-off the bones tender type with lots of BBQ sauce and extra sauce on the side for dipping.....mmmmm Plus always comes with a side of crispy fries and arugula salad with light vinaigrette to balance off the meatiness.  My favourite brunch dish would have to be Barque Benedict ($14) - smoked brisket on top of cornbread, poached eggs, bbq hollandaise with hash and salad.  Plus the blueberry, lemon, poppyseed scone for $2 is simply delicious because the tanginess and sweetness of the flavours go so well together and they're oh so tasty.  Do make reservations in advance or be prepared  to wait, but please rest assure that it will be worth  the wait."}
{"text":"I went, I meat, I survived.  But seriously it's really quite good, if you're not a big meat eater stay clear as this place was designed for us carnivores from the ground up!"}
{"text":"Came here with the bf for our Valentine's Day dinner. There was a prix fixe menu for $65 each if I remember correctly. The food were surprisingly good. I mean I expected the meats to be good, but the rest of the prix fixe were beyond my expectation. I don't know if they are offered on the regular menu, but probably not. That said, it was my first time here, (the bf had take out from this place many times) the meat sampler which was part of the prix fixe had briskets, ribs, chicken and pork belly. The briskets and pork belly were great. The ribs had good flavour but not as off-the-bone as I'd like, and the chicken was just chicken... I would come back to have the sampler again."}
{"text":"Dry Rub Ribs, sweet heat ribs - This place is no joke. Great location, warm decor, and the food rocks.  Yes, line-ups are often on weekends; but they'll get you in quick. We ate at the bar as was the first seat we could get our butts on. I had the rack with a side of smoked asparagus. Yes, smoked asparagus. I've found a new love for this smelly-pee inducing vegetable. The bartender told us they'll pretty much smoke anything, and have tried. I thank them for that.  Great draft on tap, nice atmosphere. The food IS delicious.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We ate here on Father's Day. They are always busy, so make sure u make reservation. We started with tuna wonton, which was a very fresh and yummy, though the portion is small, only 2 wontons. Ordered BBQ sampler for two, brisket was the best, juicy and tender. Everything else was just average u can get the same somewhere else. Service was a little slow. Took the waitress a long time to pack our leftover food and hand us our bill, not sure why."}
{"text":"This is the best bbq I have ever had thus far. The 12 hour brisket was super tasty unlike anywhere else I've ever tasted before. The classic rack o'bama seasoning for the ribs was of the chart. The smoked chicken was good and the complimentary spiced popcorn was a nice addition to munch on while we waited. This place is so good that I get a friend to send me by post the bbq sauce. Only thing is I wish we had a place that good in Vancouver. It's a shame when you discover a place like this and than you go back to your own city and find every joint serving ribs pails in comparison. The barque team needs to take note and realize if you ventured out west your business would smoke the competition pun intended."}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed with @barquebbq If that's a word I know it's not 'Cause I looked it up That's one of those skills That I learned in my school  -------- Just got back from brunch at Barque. Ordered the hash which comes with potatoes, some brisket, peppers, onions, eggs, and mixed with cheddar.   They don't list the cheddar on the menu, but  assumed I just misread. Didn't want that in there, but erroneously blamed myself.  Food took too long, the hash (someone else at the table ordered it as well- and for some reason one of them took 5 minutes longer than the other) just tasted....bland. Just not great. Apparently last time the group I was with was there they had the same item and it was much better. This was light on the veg and really....bland.   I ate about a third, cursing myself for missing that cheese mention on the menu (which I didn't! a-ha!) and our waiter for not telling us about the special which sounded sooooooo much better. Also weird because we mentioned that we were looking for a sandwich with eggs on it (the special was a burrito with eggs and pulled pork), but he didn't think to let us know about it.   I did not enjoy my time here. Now I am eating cold cereal.  Bill for three: 71$. Not really money well spent."}
{"text":"I'm a total ribs girl and have hit the most popular ribs spots in almost every city I go to and I have to say Barque has the best baby back ribs in my experience. I prefer the dry rub over the saucy hot ribs. But both are perfectly cooked and quality meat with great original seasoning. Not sure if they still have the cajon spice corn or the asparagus but they were AMAZING, the other sides are ok. Service can be hit/miss."}
{"text":"the meats at this place are smokin'!  went for their sunday $25 prix fixed menu - the 6.45pm reservation. they have a row of 'dining' hours where they serve everyone at the same time, sort of like a dining hall. once that batch has eaten then the next batch comes in. It's called Family Night Sundays - their menu changes slightly every Sunday - check ahead to see what they're serving.  Family Night for July 24: Pork Belly Corn Soup, watermelon/feta, 'Bama Ribs, Jerk Chicken, Smoked Skirt Steak, Smoked ChickPea Salad, Double Chocolate Chip Cookies and Milkshakes they serve you flavored popcorn as a starter - with various bbq sauces! The meats were absolutely amazing! tender and melt-in-your-mouth good, the wings and jerk chicken were so full of flavor and spices. the soup and milkshake were so-so, they almost seemed to to taste the same as each other!  the service was AWESOME! they were friendly, humorous and accommodating (since some of our party didn't eat pork etc. - for our veggie friend they reduced the $25 to $12.50) the space was personable of a smokehouse and very rustic, with dark wooden bench tables. they also have a patio.  overall this place was kick-ass! had a fun experience, food was delicious, servers were good laughs and the rustic ambiance was uplifting. will definitely go back for more smokey goodness!  around $30 to $35 per person including drinks  must try: wings, brisket and smoked skirt steak!!! crazy good!"}
{"text":"If you go for a brunch on weekend, I recommend you to go like 10 or 15mins before they open because there will be line up for sure!  I loved everything about the restaurant, seriously couldn't find any complaints.  First, I got a sparkling water for free of charge lol Amazing. Then ordered coffee....SO Fresh!   I tried barque benedict and the combination of cornbread, pork brisket, hollandaise sauce, porched egg were excellent.  Everything melt in my month so quickly...SO GOOD!  So respected the chef who come up this recipes.....  I must say....it was best brunch in Toronto. Excellent food and service, comfortable atmosphere.  My husband and I will definitely go back for dinner very very soon."}
{"text":"Had ribs, pulled pork, chicken thigh, brussels sprouts and fries. Everything was very good. Price was decent as well. Not the best BBQ I've ever had but great for a neighbourhood place."}
{"text":"Fabulous brunch Great portions and attentive staff. Blue was our waitress and she was perfectly friendly and not over attentive.  The ribs were massive and the Carolina BBQ sauce was amazing.  I wish there was one close to home"}
{"text":"Was very pleasantly surprised. A serious gem in roncesvalle and a must try for meat lovers. We ordered the mixed platter for two and it was more than enough food.   I believe the same owners also own Butcher Bar a couple doors down which will be my next destination to try."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Barque Smokehouse Cuisine: Barbeque Location: Roncesvalles Village Address: 299 Roncesvalles Ave Price Range: $15~25  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 3 Service: 4 Ambiance: 4 Overall: 3.5  Extra information:  * Brunch on the weekends * Gluten free friendly * Patio avail * Takes reservations  BBQ!!!!! okay, so you got my attention. I love meat, I can never give it up, I can never ever be a vegetarian. I love my good, quality steak but another thing I love is smokey, finger licking BBQ ribs. If you follow me on twitter, you know I already went to 3 rib festivals happening this summer....and I still wish I can go back.  Anyways, so Barque Smokehouse has been on my list for awhile and then I finally got a chance to drop by with a friend. It was a Saturday night when we dropped by and yes, I did expect we would have to wait a little since it was last minute and we walked in without reservation. Why did I go to any restaurant in Toronto without reservation? because I obviously still haven't learned my lesson.  We ended up waiting for about an hour before we were seated by the bar area. It was a long wait but the restaurant was super busy and they had a picnic table for people to sit while waiting so it was fine. But if you are planning to go, do remember to make reservation before hand!  Barque Smokehouse is not that big, but has nice cozy atmosphere with wodden interior and warm lighting. They are def space efficient (or so I thought) with fitting in all that tables in there but not over-cramping it.  Table setting with a brush for BBQ sauce  Ordered: Pulled Duck Tacos 3/5  * 3 tacos with pulled duck, green onion, carrots and hoisin sauce for $10 * Asian flavor inspired tacos seem to be popping up everywhere * My friend wanted to try this so we ordered it * It was decent but there was way too much sauce on top * Duck was tender but overall it could have used some more vegetable * I don't think I would get this again  Ordered: Barque Bloody Caesar 5/5  * Caesar with pickled beans with candied bacon rim for $10 * Caesar is not something I always loved but it grew on me over time * This was probably the 2nd best caesar I had so far * Best one I tried was at Rodney's in Vancouver (don't know if it tastes the same here in TO) * Candied bacon rim was pretty awesome and it went well with the drink * I love the pickled beans! could snack on them by itself :)  Ordered: Barque Sampler for One 3.5/5  * Choose 3 meats and 2 sides for $24 * Meats: brisket, beef rib, merguez sausage, competition chicken thigh and 1/3 rack of baby back ribs (sweet heat or dry rub) * Sides: fries, cuban corn, pickled platter, spinach spaetzle, smoked asparagus, barque caesar salad and hearts of palm salad * I picked brisket, merguez sausage and beef ribs with cuban corn and barque caesar salad * Brisket was one of the most tender brisket I've ever tasted in my life! * Usually I find them to be a little too tough or dry but it was quite moist * I personally didn't really enjoy the sausage, it didn't have much flavor and found it a little rubbery * I was the most excited about the beef ribs (prefer them over pork ribs) * The sampler comes with 1 bone of beef ribs and it didn't really have much meat on it * Sauce was good and it was smokey but there wasn't much to eat :( * Cuban corn was decent but barque caesar salad was delicious * Caesar salad was topped off with some bacon which added flavor  My friend also ordered Barque Sampler for one but with merguez sausage, competition chicken thigh and 1/3 rack of baby back ribs with side of spinach spaetzle and fries. Spinach spaetzle was something I've never tried before! It's a pasta made from spinach and it was super soft in texture. Came with tomatoes, mushrooms and topped off with parmesan chips- it was interesting. Their fries were so good! super thin and crispy, just the way I like it  Summary: Despite the one hour wait, my dinner at Barque Smokehouse was quite enjoyable. food and good company is always good times, right? I am glad I gave Barque Smokehouse a try- nothing REALLY impressed me and I wouldn't say it's my favorite spot for BBQ meats but if you are in the area, give it a try! I would go back just for their awesome bloody caesar with the candied bacon rim...maybe...:)"}
{"text":"Super disappointed with the ribs from Barque. They weren't tender in any sense of the word. The sauces were mediocre. The fries were great, but that's where it ended!"}
{"text":"Trendy hipster joint that has a Canadian interpretation of good ol'American Southern BBQ. Nice touch with the popcorn and two sauces (red and yellow) and old skool 90's cartoons on the TV behind the bar. The bar seats are the best because you can watch the bartenders move about.  We ordered the rib dinner with sausage and three sides for $35, which is a good deal considering the giant meat platter that soon arrived. Nice presentation with each side dish on its own little skillet.  The funnily named, Goldman Sacked, dessert was OK...I'd recommend the warm pecan tart with a glob of cinnamon gelato melting on top.   The overall price for all that food wasn't as high as I thought it would be and I wasn't crazy stuffed either, which is a good thing considering all the food that was had.  Needs more parking options."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place. Service is always on point, friendly and they actually remember your face when returning. I always start with a smoked Whiskey Sour and then straight to the sampler platters. The ribs are some of the best I've had. Both tasty and very meaty. Side wise the Caesar salad and Cuban corn is killer. Close off the meal with an espresso and the pecan pie. Whew! Done like dinner. See you soon."}
{"text":"This place is heaven on earth for all meat lovers. The fries were delicious and everything tasted fresh. It was one of the best meals I have had in a long time. I highly recommend this place to everyone. Make reservations online as the wait is quite long without them. And the beer selection is local and extravagant"}
{"text":"So I finally went to Barque on Roncesvalles , drove from Rexdale on a Friday evening for takeout. It was a good decision as the tables were packed. i was worried the place was going to be a bust like the Stockyards and Phils BBQ where i have eaten multiple times and been disappointed on every occasion. The Smokehouse lived up yo the hype, the staff is very helpful and polite. I ordered a sampler for one with Spicy baby back ribs ( just okay 3 star), the giant beef rib ( hella tasty ,5 star) and the brisket ( succulent and not to fatty ,5 star). We also enjoyed the chipotle wings ( 4 star) and Miami beef ribs ( 5 star plus)which are actually cut  Korean Kaibi style. These were amazing ,  bark on them had amazing depth of flavour. i would have to say Barque Smokehouse is definitely the top spot for proper bbq in all the GTA followed by Memphis BBq and wicked wings in Woodbridge, it's a authentic dive inside but the food is consistently great . Please save your time and money and avoid Phils and especially The Stockyards which to me is the most overrated resto in Toronto."}
{"text":"I love this place. So much. So So much. If you want smoked meat this place is incredible. Great cocktails also. Only negative is the food coma. get 3 friends and order the sharing meal. its amazing."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had a great smoked chicken sandwich and delicious spinach salad. Loved the variety on the menu, and service was very friendly - except when I found a hair wrapped around a Spinach leaf in my salad. The server took the salad away and brought another one, but I was surprised that other than an \"oh, sorry about that\" they didn't comp me at least the salad portion of my meal? Seemed chintzy that they made me pay for a salad with a long black curly hair in it!"}
{"text":"I've been up and down Roncesvalles more times than I can count, and I can count pretttty high, so the opening of a smokehouse definitely caught my attention. Roncesvalles has plenty of great restaurants that will satiate anyone's hankering for pizza, sushi, pub food and the like, but what about BBQ?! For those who had been previously denied meat of the smoked nature, Barque must have seemed like a southern dream coming true when it opened its doors for the first time.  I've heard that the brunch is drool worthy, but I was only lucky enough to get in for lunch one day. I say lucky because this place is always jammed and the waiting time can often be up to an hour or more. However, if you have your eye on the prize (ie. a rack of baby back ribs perhaps), you'll endure the restless wait. My lunch consisted of a spicy caesar and the smoked Barque burger. While it did not make me fall of my chair (I'm surprised a few caesars didn't either), it was tasty and the arugula salad on the side was a nice complement to the dish. My friend had the Halibut, which I enjoyed more than my own meal. Why I always want what my lunch date orders I'll never know, but I managed to steal a few bites and the fish was fresh and cooked perfectly.  In addition to the food, the atmosphere is casual and the restaurant well-designed with some high thick wooden tables and the lower variety where families can gather round to devour plates of saucy brisket, ribs, wings and chicken. With that said, vegetarians will be happy to find a few items on the menu that they can equally enjoy while not having to worry about BBQ war wounds being left on their cheeks.  Barque is a feel good joint (and a bit of a carnivore's dream)...a little Texan, a little Cuban, and a whole lot good!"}
{"text":"Came here late one night and the baby back ribs are just to die for. I can't imagine life without this place. The sauces, the service, the meat... ohhhhh....  the only thing I WILL say is that their ribs are not \"fall off the bone\" type of ribs... so, watch out for that if you're hoping for that. The folks there are solid."}
{"text":"Service was fine.  We weren't really paying attention.  We had the Smoker's Choice. The wings to start were quite good.  After that, it was less appealing.  Brisket: dry and a little tough; saved by sauce. Chicken: pretty good; a tad dry. Ribs: taste was fine, but again, a little dry. Pulled pork;  too chunky and not sauced much.  Potatoes were good. Not sure I would want to return - must be better barbeque out there."}
{"text":"Smokin' hot.  A BBQ lover's dream! Juicy. Smokey. Flavorful.  Meat Heaven.  If you are wondering what makes Barque bbq is so magical... magic consists of sugar, ketchup, mustard, and Coke!!! Coca-Cola can do no wrong! =)    I had the sampler for one person ($22), which was the perfect sized portion to try a bunch of items.    Meats * Smoked chicken - Fantastic and smokey! * Brisket, cooked for 14 hours, it is super tender and delicious! * Dry-rub ribs - Not fall off the bone soft but yummy and meaty.  Sides * Asparagus - As expected. * Ravioli - Surprisingly good for a bbq place.  Not overcooked, stuffed with ricotta and spinach.  The salads here also looked great.  It's nice that you can get green sides!  Dessert * Salted caramel truffle from The Chocolateria.  A bit warm, salty, but really yummy. * Beignets with grilled pineapple and caramel sauce.  This dessert was good... Caramel sauce was a bit thin and the donuts were alright but nothing exceptional.  I feel like the pecan pie would have been better.    On another note, it's awesome that they have brunch here!!!  Eggs Benedict... with brisket? With cornbread? Mmm meaty breakfast.  Unrelated, we were here on Canada day and our server managed to have everyone in the restaurant on their feet and singing the anthem, loved it! Go Canada! W00t W00t!"}
{"text":"One of my friends suggested that we (a group of 6 men) test out this newly open BBQ spot on Roncy.  I walked down from the 501 Queen Street street car and it took me about 10-15 mins.  Which was no big deal even though I needed an umbrella.  It was packed from the moment we walked in the door at 7pm. Thankfully my friend reserved a table for 6 or we might have been standing in the rain.  Huge selection of BBQ meats that were totally a reasonable price point. There were two selections of platters that included a choice of brisket, baby back ribs, beef rib or chicken and sides of cuban corn, pickle platter, salad for either $20 (for one) or $36 (for two).   My biggest shout out of meat goes to the:  Beef brisket, that I specifically didn't ask for, in my combo selection w the Waitress, but this error worked out in my favor as the flavoring and taste was outstanding. Melted in my mouth.  Best of side between my selections of the pickle platter and Cuban corn was:  *drum roll* the Cuban Corn... tho it was only a half corn, which was more of a tease than a side dish.  The chef/co-owner came to our table to thank us and asked us for our thoughts.  I was honest with him in my one dislike. He told me that his goal was to get away from the \"southern\" thoughts of BBQ and wanted it to be his own twist.  Which he accomplished.  However, my seat faced the kitchen and the BBQ/stove was made by a company called SOUTHERN PRIDE... which their label/logo was the size of a 5x7 photo and clearly visible from my seat.  So I would take a screwdriver and pop that off today.  The name BARQUE* actually is pronounced as BARK. Therefore, the space was done well with a bar at the back, with a screened fence design where you could see the apple logs piled up ready for the BBQ.  3/5 and I will go back.  - Stone."}
{"text":"UPDATE: *** After going to a few other BBQ places in TO, I have to say that nothing has topped Barque for me. We have been here countless times. Therefore I have updated my review to 5 stars! ***   We got the sampling platter. It came with wings, nachos, salad, ribs, brisket, bbq chicken, little potato things, a chard-veggie thing and a butterscotch brownie with rum sauce.  The table also starts you with yummy seasoned popcorns and free sparkling water.  The best::::  The wings! were super tasty and cooked nicely. Really good with the bbq sauce on top which is provided at the table.  The brisket! Really soft but in a good way.  The little fried potatoes! They smelled like doughnuts, and they were nice and crispy!  And the brownie, which was quite good.  The so/so:::  Veggie thinks were kinda oily and bland for my liking. Also might I say I find that the bbq chicken I was hoping to be crispy like the wings and it was not. Also, I found the ribs a little more dry/overcooked than what I expected.  The service: Ok. Pretty friendly. Few mistakes and a little confusion seating us in our reservation, but overall not a problem.  We shall return for sure!"}
{"text":"I went there for brunch today for the very first time.  We had a reservation and were seated in about 5 minutes after arriving.  The place was pretty full but it didn't feel crowded.  The service was excellent and the food was delicious. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with fries and loved every bite. I loved the atmosphere and I will definitely return there to eat.  I am looking forward to trying their lunch and dinner menu!"}
{"text":"I went to the Beach, BBQ & Brews Festival (Toronto Beach near Ashbridge's Bay) and tried Camp 31 Brewton Alabama ribs today that were fire grilled & I thought that Barque's was better."}
{"text":"Omg I love barque. I have a special place in my heart...err actually in my stomach, for meat, but I still can't believe how good barque can make meat taste. I love the smoky flavour that they seem to be able to impart in anything.  For starters, I swear the popcorn they serve to snack on before the meal must have crack in it. You can't go wrong with ordering the BBQ platter and while all the meats and sides are good, my favourite meats are the ribs and brisket.  Beware that the ribs aren't the super soft fall-off-the-bone kind, but they are rubbed with herbs and spices that I have never anywhere else tasted on ribs and have a really nice smokey flavour. I recommend the smoked asparagus side for something very yummy and different.  For brunch I really enjoyed the duck and blueberry pancakes, the sweet and salty went really well together.  No complaints about service, it's an average, busy restaurant."}
{"text":"Had a half rack BBQ ribs (dry rub) plus winter slaw (carrots and other root vegetables) to help push down all the BBQ I devoured (also sampled my friends' beef brisket and original-style, sauce-basted ribs).  Pro tip: I liked the taste of the dry rub more, but it can be kind of dry.  I asked for BBQ sauce on the side, which came quite in handy.  Ditto for the beef brisket - it was quite dry, and if I were to go back, I'd recommend ordering the ribs or anything else over it.  One of my friends preferred the wings, though I found the spicy-sweet heat was a bit more on the spicy than the sweet side.    Our main server was really nice and attentive, filled our water (flat or carbonated, both are free) constantly, and was overall friendly.  The bussers, however, were way too eager to clear our table - our popcorn was taken away completely full while we were still eating it, and I was asked multiple times if I was finished with my plate even while the slaw was still half full and a couple ribs still on the plate...I was still chewing when trying to tell them I'm still working on it.  Overall, I'd say it's OK to come here if you happen to be nearby but otherwise nothing particularly calling me back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to some good brisket, its one of my favs . Saw a lot of reviews about this place and I wanted to see and taste for myself. Well the staff are really nice and very courteous. ordered the lunch sampler platter with brisket and ribs my girlfriend ordered the lunch sampler with chicken and ribs. I was not impressed by any means I have had fresh brisket that just melts in your mouth ,but this looked and tasted like re-heated brisket ,looked and tasted dry .Try to mask it by putting sauce on it . I have  had better brisket from Fat Louis  food truck than this. Very disappointing.Was not impressed by the ribs either , barely any meat mostly bone with a spicy kick . I asked my girlfriend about her chicken ,chicken is her thing. She showed it to me and it was still pink and raw ,turned her off right of the bat and she didn't  even touch her ribs.The thing I enjoyed the most was the fries and she enjoyed the soup. If this is the kind of food they are pushing out its is very disappointing. this place is way over-rated, food wise. I expected fresh melt in your mouth brisket , Its a smoke house, and it fell way short of that. The thing this place has going for it is the staff and that's about it. If you think this is good  BBQ, your sadly mistaken, or you don't know or have  NOT experience good BBQ. I'm giving it 2 stars simply cause of the staff. Maybe my expectations were a little to high ??"}
{"text":"A sassy rib A neoliberal salad A hungover brisket  Fun fact: Thanks God I rented a car that day and dropped by this gem, otherwise meh too far Sad fact: Please open a more downtown core location. Dry brisket. Winners: Watermelon salad with goat cheese. Popcorn complimentary. The Bbq sauces and portions."}
{"text":"Every bite was pure awesomeness. We went for brunch and had the Eggs Benedict, Fried Eggs and Pulled Pork and Apple French Toast, along with a side of candied bacon and a cheddar biscuit. The eggs Benny were fab. with sweet cornbread as the base. Along with a delicious potato pancake on the side. The cumin beans with the fried eggs were soooo good and so was the side of guacamole.   The Apple French toast was a tower of flavourful fluffiness.   The cheddar biscuit was fresh and perfectly chewy.   But my favourite bite was the candied bacon. Salty, sweet, crispy, spicy, so complex yet simply wonderful!  We shall be back!"}
{"text":"My goodness! This is soooooo good! I was in the mood for ribs and my buddy, who's definitely a restaurant connoisseur, suggested we go to this place.  Between 3 people, we had the Meet Meat Platter which consists of: Brisket, Ribs, Pulled Pork, Chorizo sausages, Chicken. We had chicken wings to start and they were pretty big but not hot enough. I like my wings super hot so we ordered the hottest they had but that wasn't very hot.  For sides, we had Mac and Cheese (*Drool*) and Fries (Fresh cut, thin, Crispy *Droool*). We didn't finish the platter because there was so much food and my favorite out of everything was definitely the ribs with the classic sauce."}
{"text":"Appetizers are creative and delicious. Meat was great too - but not my favourite. I would go back for the appetizers, atmosphere and free popcorn. Make sure to make a reservation - well in advance."}
{"text":"This has to be the best BBQ restaurant I have been to, hands down. I had ribs, brisket and a lamb sausage. They were all fantastic, with the brisket being just a tad too dry for my liking. Oddly enough though, the Caesar salad was the highlight for me! The dressing tasted extremely fresh and was not too strong. Service was flawless. I can't wait to get back to Barque again!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for beef brisket.  Melts in your mouth deliciousness.  I am rating this pretty much on the brisket, I've tried other items long time ago but settled on my favourite. I remember everything else being good but not as good as that mouth watering beef.  One of the few foods I drool for just thinking about.  Always great service and atmosphere. This place is always busy, plan accordingly."}
{"text":"My sweetheart and I checked out Barque in its very early days (when it first opened last year).   The year prior, we had spent a week in New Orleans and a few days down in Memphis... so we do know what good deep down smoked southern barbeque should taste like... It should taste like Barque!  We shared the Sampler with the Brisket, Baby Back Ribs, and Chicken (plus Ceasar salad and Ravioli). It was quite a bit of food (just like in the deep south)! The house BBQ sauce was wonderful as was pretty much everything that we ate. All of the meat was perfectly juicy and melted in our mouths... The ceasar salad had fresh bacon on it, which was a welcome surprise.   Barque only has St.Ambroise beer on tap, which is amazing (try the Apricot Wheat beer - my personal fave).   The restaurant interior is very modern, with exposed brick and high tables. In the summer, the patio is pretty happening too.   I will venture to say that making a reservation is now an absolute must (Barque looks packed to the brim whenever I'm heading home on the streetcar)."}
{"text":"Been here many times and always enjoy it. They switch up the menu enough where you can try something new while still eating what you enjoy. The best option is to try the sampler as well as the chicken wings. Service is also fantastic here. The place is a bit pricey but the great food and service make you forget about it. Come hungry!"}
{"text":"Very busy but good service. Went for dinner and brunch. Their brunch menu is awesome.  I strongly suggest the duck panckakes and the Hugo as a drink. Most probably need a reservation for the brunch since it is so busy. The only bad thing I need to say is their brunch drinks are overpriced. Oh and they have a montreal based brewery on tap named Sainte-Ambroise and it is delicious, I suggess you try the abricot beer."}
{"text":"Nice decor and the staff was very friendly.  I had the smoked salmon sandwich which I have to say was very bland: very plain/mild tasting smoked salmon on a white bun with a small side salad that tasted like it was dressed with oil and nothing else. The menu described pickled fennel and hickory sticks on the sandwich but these were barely perceptible."}
{"text":"Very good, and very busy...we didn't have reservations and waited nearly 90 minutes for a table on a Monday night.    We ordered two barbecue samplers for two and everything was delicious.  In terms of sides, the fries, spaetzle and Cuban corn was fantastic.  it would've been nice if the bar area was not reserved for dinner and was available for drinks while you waited, but we found a nearby establishment to suit our needs and waited there.  It was well worth the wait.  If I find myself in this area again I'll make an effort to stop in."}
{"text":"There's a good reason or two for why this restaurant is considered to be the best in TO for barbeque. It offers what can best be described as refined barbeque.  We tried the sweet heat ribs and the dry ribs and both were finger-licking good. Had to have the bacon-rimmed caesar - yummy! BLT in a glass.  Recommend making reservations for a Saturday night so you can get a table.  We were good with sitting at the bar and enjoyed the company around us. Decor is welcoming and lends itself to a wonderful date out with your significant other.  Dressy or casual."}
{"text":"Came here this past Saturday for a double-date, and even though the Polish festival was on, we received much faster service then we expected and had an overall fantastic evening. All four of us will definitely be back. Thank you Barque's for impressing my boyfriend and giving us the kind of memories that live on forever as \"that awesome time we went on a double date\"."}
{"text":"really really disappointed with brunch here. This was a place where there was already a small lineup before it was open. Had the eggs benny as I always do whenever it's available and considering the price and portion size, it must be up there with the worst ones I've had.  They were pretty stingy on the brisket, which was nothing great. Cornbread so so. I think the only good thing about it was the house fries which was also a small serving. The worst thing about it was the egg, which was a few seconds away from a fully boiled egg (see photo)."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with BARQUE.   We were lucky to get reservations made last minute as we were downtown shopping on a Sunday.  They informed us of the preset menu at the time of booking which was good and we were looking forward to it.   I started with the Barque Caesar in a bacon brimmed glass which was delish.  It was awesome to try Smoked Turkey Meatballs and Pulled Pork Salsa.  The main course was Smoked Quarter Chicken & Ribs which was falling off the bone.  Everything was tasty & reminded me of a backyard bbq.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"An inviting, smokey aroma greets you as you enter into a nice, warm artisanal laid back BBQ joint. Unlike other \"hipster\" Toronto spots, this place didn't blast loud music and made it easy to hold a conversation.   On the table was a tin of popcorn, and I think it was flavoured with one of the BBQ sauces that they have. It was pretty addictive. We easily went through 2 tins before our food arrived.   I had the Smoked Half Chicken with a side of Cuban Corn and Baby Kale Salad. Now ... I don't normally say this but this was easily the best meal I've had in a long time.   I'm blown away by the quality and authenticity of the food. Not one complaint.   I will definitely come and eat here again when I'm craving some authentic BBQ. It's rare to find a place that consistently does every dish well, extremely impressed."}
{"text":"It's been a long while since my visit to Barque and while my experience was good there were a number of small gaffs and \"could have done betters\" to improve the experience overall.  Pro-Tip right off that bat, make reservations here. We did and it was still a 30 minute wait which is where they lost a star right off the hop.  Once seated, I must say I loved the rustic feel of this space. Wood everywhere, kitschy ornaments galore, cheeky little pieces here and there. Loved it! It's everything you want/expect a BBQ place to look like. However must agree with other reviewers who pointed out the tight fit of seating here (I don't really want to hear all my neighbours conversations).  Side note to the men: The urinal had a miniature soccer net set up inside it with a hanging min-soccer ball to help perfect your \"aim.\" Aim be damn I was wishing I had drank more water that day so I could keep playing - I was going for the high score. Ahhhh well simple pleasures to amuse simple minds I guess (I was extremely amused - you could hear my Stewie Griffin giggles coming from the restroom).  I digress...  Back at the table is where my DC and I REALLY scored! We went for the Sampler For Two, where you get your choice of 3 Meats and 3 Sides. For our meats we went for the Beef Brisket, 2 Competition Chicken Thighs and 1/3 rack of Baby Back Ribs ( done sweet heat). AND for the sides we went for the Barque Caesar Salad, Smoked Asparagus, and Heirloom Tomato Salad. All for $45. The price was pretty fair but I felt that coming with a female DC this was enough food, however had my DC been male it wouldn't have been close to enough.  For the meats, the chicken and the ribs were fantastic, however the brisket was a touch overdone and a little dry. As for the sides I really found the Heirloom Tomato Salad to be very very fresh and full of flavour, caesar salad was standard as far as caesar salads go BUT the smoked asparagus was the surprising star of the night. I'm not sure if it's still on the menu, but if you get a chance go for it! You won't be disappointed.  Staff were friendly but due to the full capacity of the restaurant were slightly absent at times.   Overall a good experience and I'd definitely come back when it's less busy to see if the food can be even better and perhaps the space a little less crowded.  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"it was probably a bad idea to try the brisket at the roncesvalle festival. my sandwich tasted like a coleslaw sandwich , i could not taste the beef as there was just a little in there my friend told me to go back to  ask them if it was a joke.... i should have listen to her, now i hesitate to go again , i mean in the restaurant... big no when there is a street event"}
{"text":"My experience here was fine. But I had higher expectations. We went for brunch on a Saturday morning. It was busy but we had no problem getting a table for two. We chose the patio as it was nice outside.  The food was bland. I thought expected the food to be so much more tastier and so I was disappointed. Same for my husband. I got the duck confit pancakes and he got the brisket Benedict. Not good.  It all went south when my husband paid the bill and we left..on my way home out of curiosity I asked him how much it totaled and he said $83. I was floored. He couldn't find the receipt. We called the credit card company to make sure. And yep $83 for a meal that should've cost $40. Tax and tip included.  Maybe our bill got swapped with another table or maybe they charged us for stuff we didn't order. We'll never know. And my husband is responsible for not double checking but he learn his lesson.  The staff did what they needed to. Served food, refilled water. Brought the \"wrong\" bill. Service wasn't excellent it was just okay.   Soooo the bill left a sour taste in our mouths on top on the bland taste that was already there.  We wouldn't go cause its not like the food did anything for us either."}
{"text":"I like meat. This place was good for bbq meat...not great, only good. The popcorn on the table when u arrive however is fucking awesome! I hate popcorn, i cant stand even the smell of it. But i couldnt stop eating barque's popcorn, Delicious!  I dont know whether id return, its not a bad spot, but theres plenty better in toronto  The food was tasty. The seasonings were a bit ametuer and there wasnt enough lighter options on the menu, let alone options for veg. The brisket was great, the pork was great, ribs are great....it was all tasty food Although there were no salads, or chicken that wasnt wings. (No one should ever eat chicken wings in public)  I wasnt blown away by the level of cuisine here. It felt like an all-you-can-eat sports bar. There were tvs on and kids running round tables. I cant quite remember if they didnt do cocktails at all or if they only had bourbon and whisky. Im not a huge wine drinker, hate beer, but i love cocktails, give me anything citrusy or herbacious with gin or vodka. However i had to settle for an overpriced prosecco.  I think i left so tired because of the huge pile of heavy meats theyd put in front of me..... Which of course i had to eat all of, cz it was good. But i was in pain, my stomach hurt, i had to pull down my sweater and undo a button on my jeans. I was uncomfortable.... Id scoffed down far too much mediocre food"}
{"text":"Heard nice things about this restaurant and made a reservation for my boyfriend and I on a friday night. The place was packed when we arrived that night, the wait was only about 5 to 10 minutes with the reservation. The service was fast and the food also came quickly. We had ordered the platter for two with the beef brisket, baby back ribs and beef ribs with 3 sides. The beef brisket and creamy smoked cauliflower side were absolutely delicious. Unfortunately the rest was a miss. I would come back for the brisket and cauliflower again if we are in the area."}
{"text":"ALWAYS enjoy our meals here. Family style dinner is my favourite. Best brisket I've had in the city by far. House-made bbq sauces are bold and tasty and always perfectly compliment the meats. Usually quite busy so there can be a wait to get a table and noise level is high in winter. Summer patio small and lovely."}
{"text":"Sunday night at Barque for Prixe Fixe was one of the most enjoyable dining experiences I've ever had. I highly suggest this format since you'll be treated to most of Barque's incredible appetizers, mains and desserts. From what I understand, Sundays will continue to be the Prixe Fixe format, so go hungry and prepared to be stuffed!  I'd love to go into the details about each of the incredible foods that were presented to us but since the element of surprise was so enjoyable, I'll leave it to you to simply go.  And go you must!  From the service to the ambiance to the delactable food, this place is sure to become a mainstay and an establishment that people will travel from far and wide to eat at.  I will definitely be back. Perhaps even tonight! And I plan to write about all of the great things I experience each time.  Hands down, this is my new favourite place to chow down."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time with friends.  Great food, comfortable space and attentive service.  We got the family style meal and were very satisfied.  The wings were very good."}
{"text":"We went here based on good recommendation and good reviews and were told that seating would be hard without reservations and boy, were they right. The place is guaranteed to be packed on a weekend or even a weekday dinner, which isn't a complaint, but more of something to be aware of when deciding on an impromptu place for dinner.   Based on what blogto and other people were saying, we were expecting some fabulous ribs...unfortunately we left a little disappointed. Our side ribs were too dry and we weren't fans of the sauce either (which is completely personal preference).   The service is pretty good, but I feel that because it's so busy and packed, you won't get someone checking in on you very often. All servers seemed generally very nice and friendly when we were there, but was difficult to flag someone at times.  All complaints we had I guess had more to do with our preference in how we like our ribs done, since other people seem to think their ribs were perfect--it just wasn't for us. We pretty much went in expecting some of the best ribs in toronto, but left feeling that our homemade ribs on a BBQ at home are what we should've gone for instead."}
{"text":"I went into this place with very high expectations and my meal had both high points and low points.  The service was very friendly and informative for newbies to this kind of cuisine (southern style bbq I guess is what they serve here).  The free complementary popcorn was interesting but I found it bland and kind of tasteless. We tried the barque sampler for 2.  For meat, we got the beef ribs, baby back ribs, and competition chicken thighs.  And for sides, we got the fries, mixed vegetables, and pickled platter.  The mixed vegetables and pickled platter were fantastic.  The fries on the other hand were kind of soggy.  As for the meat, everything was well cooked.  The chicken thighs were super moist and juicy but extremely bland and rather tasteless.  The beef ribs were beautifully cooked but nothing overly special in terms of flavour.  The highlight of the meal was definitely the baby back ribs (we got the sweet heat as opposed to the dry rub).  I could eat a huge plate of these on my own for sure as the meat was both well cooked and bursting with a lot of flavour from the spices they put on it.  Still, considering how much hype surrounds this place, I left feeling somewhat unsatisfied and slightly disappointed.  To be fair though, I know now what I do like there so if I were to return, I know what to order and what to avoid.  And perhaps I should learn to stop having such unrealistic expectations as no place would probably meet them.  Solid place overall."}
{"text":"Went here a few months back and tried everything on the menu (I was with 9 other people :P). I just loved everything they had to offer. The dry rub ribs, competition chicken thigh and the beef brisket were cooked to perfection. This is one of my favourite reasons for living on the west side of Toronto!"}
{"text":"Pretty good barbecue! We ordered dry wings, fries, pulled pork/chorizo sausage, kale salad and duck tacos. All were very yummy! The Bloody Mary was one of the best I've had in a long time. Great service and surprisingly very kids friendly! They offered our kids coloring books, Plato and they got to decorate cookies for dessert!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to write a good review for this place, but the food just hasn't been that good. I've heard a lot of mixed reviews, so I'm thinking it must be hit/miss with the food quality. I live in the neighbourhood and the restaurant is always busy. I've been three times (twice for dinner and once for brunch). The atmosphere is nice and the staff are friendlyThe food was fine, but not particularly good. The brisket was overcooked and dry, the sides lacked flavour. I'm hoping this place improves and I'll likely try it again, but for the time being I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday night and waited for about an hour which was ok because they have a bar two doors down that you can hang in while you are waiting! It's called the Butcher Bar!   Had the sampler for one which includes your choice of 3 meats and 2 sides...I picked Pork Rack o'rama ribs Chicken thigh  Coleslaw Fries  He got... Beef brisket Sausage Rack o'rama ribs Potato salad  Collard greens  Everything was delicious...the ribs were ahhhhhMazing! The pork was tender and the brisket was the best we have had in awhile!   Overall the meats were on point...the sides were so-so but the whole experience from the service, food to the atmosphere I'd say a 10!"}
{"text":"Went to Barque last night.  Great food. Amazing service. I would say that given my man is a meat smoking connoisseur we were expecting a bit more flavour in the meat but I think thats because we are spoiled.  Overall great and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Another bad experience... the staff have a great ability to not care about the service.  I live in the neighborhood and buy to go products from there locations and recommend them at the 5 star hotel I work at.  But I've finally come to an end ... service is essential in the hospitality industry and they give the impression that because their product is good they can treat people however they want.  I have had many good experiences...no great ones... and now a few really bad ones...so I say good bye and will take my business to a business that cares to have it...and they won't care at all."}
{"text":"This was a last ditch effort to find a place to have brunch as the original spot didn't pan out.  There was a small lineup at the door but thankfully we didn't have to wait as we decided to sit at the bar. I ordered the eggs benny with the brisket.  It comes with a salad and side of potatoes. They have other other options for the benny as well but understandably all focus on a some sort of meat offering (this is a smokehouse after all)  The eggs were done well. Hollandaise sauce was decent too. The salad was OK if you like Kale. The benny is served on corn bread which was good. Now for the brisket while good on its own it just overpowered everything on the plate so I would just recommend sticking to the brisket and not having it with eggs. Nice smoky finish with a lingering sweet taste on the brisket. This place gets slammed in the evening so I think brunch might be a good option to try their offerings. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Dinner - meh...Brunch - GREAT!  Went for dinner....didn't love it but thought I'd give it a 2nd chance - I was equally disappointed then too.  The meat is dry and the flavours aren't that great. Personally, I do a better BBQ, and my BBQ sauce is killer!  I had all but written off Barque entirely until I saw a picture and recipe in Toronto Life about their Smoke Duck on Blueberry Pancakes for brunch and I thought, \"Hell yes I have to try that!\"  It was DELICIOUS.  Go early for brunch. I'm pretty sure they don't do resos, and the wait will start quickly.  I wont be back for dinner, but I'll definitely be back for brunch soon,"}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow.  We booked for last minute reservations on Victoria Day Monday. Unbeknownst to us it was a family style dinner, but we couldn't have planned it better.  The meal started with a shot of chilled corn soup, a croquette, and a piece of fried fish. Delicious. Next we were welcomed with a platter of MEAT. (A most welcoming site, no?) a small cast iron pans worth of potato salad, curried veggies, and a lovely arugula salad, so nice that it prompted my eating mate to ask for the recipe for the dressing.  The meat was fantastic, and although I was initially disappointed at the amount, it was more than enough. It was well cooked and DELICIOUS.   The meal ended with a little banana milkshake, just a perfect sweet touch to end the meal.  Our group of four was seated at the back bar which was perfect as we could watch the kitchen come and go (and we were served quickly). The staff were all friendly, and funny. I was also impressed at how they handled all the cute kids running around. This id definitely a family friendly joint.  $50 with one glass of wine, taxes and tip included."}
{"text":"This place is great. From the comfortable mid-century modern design chairs, exposed brick, reclaimed wood table, the flavoured popcorn with the super tasty dipping sauce to having possibility the tastiest beef brisket I have ever had (and I have tried my fair share). Make reservations, you can get resos the day of if you book online. I strongly recommend a visit. I have yet to try brunch but that is next. Everything is very tasty."}
{"text":"AWESOME!!!  My husband and I recently visited Toronto and we went there TWICE it was so good!  We are both American and love Barbecue and this is one of the best barbecue style places we've been too.  The food is great, would recommend the Smoked Shrimp Appetizer and the Brisket.  The service is great too!  Want to visit Toronto again just to go back!"}
{"text":"I went to this place with high hopes of eating good food and receiving some great service... I think the only thing i liked consuming at this place was the water... ok ok fine the duck tacos were good but that was  IT!!!!!   The place really looked busy which is a good thing right? I really don't understand why it was busy... or probably people were there  for the drinks? or convenience? I don't know!   The menu looked a bit confusing for someone who's been there for the first and probably last time ;)  Our server was alright...I felt a bit weirded out when we were trying to ask her questions and she kind of made us feel like we're a bit stupid for not understanding the menu and how it worked. She knew we were there for the first time and did not recommend any items.  She did not seem helpful at all. She did not explain the different sauce types or anything!!!   We ordered the sampler for two...  It includes one appetizer, three bbq items and two sides for 60 dollars.   We ordered duck tacos for appetizer (as previously mentioned)  southern fried chicken, smoked maple salmon (I cant remember the name) and pulled lamb shoulder    Mac and cheese and garlic mashed potatoes.  The portions were great or it just seemed great because we hardly ate anything.   Southern fried chicken (Soggy fried chicken) or more like they boiled the chicken.   Smoked maple salmon was decent   the pulled lamb shoulder had....well...no taste... and was not \"pulled enough\"   Mac and cheese tasted like cardboard box   and garlic mashed potatoes tasted like garlic toothpaste with no taste? I don't even know how to describe the food honestly. I was so disappointed.   I ran into another friend there who did not enjoy the food either... and another co worker stated that the ribs were really dry and tasteless.   I was really disappointed with the place.   The tables are fairly close to one another so you can definately hear what the table next to you is talking about and vice versa.   but let me try to find some pros of going here:  1. They greet you when you enter 2. They give you an option of either sparkling water or regular water 3. They serve you when the food is ready 4. I'm glad at least our server noticed that we hardly touched our food and offered to pack it for us.  5. The washrooms were clean 6. They did not kick us out when they closed and let us take our time to leave 7. Finding parking was not too bad   I do think this place really needs to change up their recipes or something...and at least hire friendlier servers or at least train them again.  I DO NOT recommend this place. If you want to waste your money, then go ahead.I wish I had taken my 76 dollars somewhere else that was worth my calories intake and time.  Thank you for reading while I barkabout the Barque smokehouse :)"}
{"text":"Went here for my traditional BBQ bday dinner last night. I guess it should be bbbq because of my bday, amirite? Sorry.   The measure of great BBQ, for me, is the brisket. Is it tender? Is it juicy? Does it have a decent amount of \"pull\"? Will it love me for who I am? Yes, yes, yes, and god I hope so.   Had the sampler for 2 with beef ribs, chicken and of course the aforementioned brisket. It was all well seasoned and had a good amount of smoke infused. No surprises, ain't nothing wrong with that my man. The sides were also decent. For $65ish for the 2 of us that's not bad at all. And also, can I say, being offered still and carbonated water? Yes.   Go here for some honest BBQ."}
{"text":"Very nice brunch spot here. Interior decor is very hip with exposed brick. They have a communal wooden table facing roncesvales. Service was very friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I have had food poisoning here !!! I am vegetarian and had some of the veggie dishes and early next morning I was puking my guts out all day! Food was delicious but unfortunately I can't come back to barque :("}
{"text":"I went to this place yesterday for brunch and asked for the Duck pancakes ($16). It totally ruined my brunch experience as the pancakes were so dry that I couldn't cut though them. They tried to mask it by putting the drier ones in the bottom of the plate but I was unable to eat them and had to leave half of my plate untouched. Unfortunately I didn't have the time to send the plate back to the kitchen and ask for something else as I should have done. Waste of money and my time. Not going back there again. Thx"}
{"text":"Wow, Barque has a very fresh point of view on brunch.  I had walked by this place a couple of times, but it was always packed so I had marked it as something to check out later.  I stumbled in last Sunday and by chance I my choice of the patio or inside.  I ended up with a wonderful and friendly server who seized on my first question and recommended the pancakes with duck and blueberry compote.  It sounds like an odd dish, but the experience turned out delicious as I enjoyed an oatmeal stout alongside the savory pancakes.  It's obviously an overly popular place, but if you catch Barque at just the right moment then you experience a sweet atmosphere on Roncesvalles."}
{"text":"I did enjoy Barques. Although I have to say Im still bothered that the food isnt hot.. (minus one star for that) I guess I'm just not used to it The chicken was really well done and the brisket was pretty darn awesome. I've had better ribs"}
{"text":"Made reservations easily online for Father's Day dinner.  Any restaurant that takes reservations these days is already a-ok in my books.  We got there at 5 pm, and we asked to sit on their nicely shaded patio.  Ended up being the best decision, as there was a screaming child inside the ENTIRE TIME we were there (note to parents: at some point, maybe 2 hours in, it might be nice if you just took your kid for a walk or something.  Let everyone enjoy their Father's Day....)  Service was unobtrusive but friendly, our server Jonathan was helpful and all smiles.  We had the Sunday Family Dinner, which is every Sunday, not just for Father's Day.  $30 each, everyone at the table has to participate.  We got with this: smoked wings, argula salad, kale, beans, brisket, chicken, ribs AND chocolate cake.  Everything was very good, I thought the wings and the kale were my favourites, but my father liked the salad a lot.    Bathrooms were lovely.  I'd be back for sure, but probably only if I got to sit on the patio again.  Thanks for a fun and overly filling evening, Barque!"}
{"text":"Dear Barque,  I love you. I know it's a bit early to say this, and I know you hear it a lot. But I fell in love with you the instant someone mentioned bacon rimmed caesers, and you had me at bacon. I hadn't even seen you at this point, but I knew we were a match made in Heaven.  Despite you not taking reservations, you let me put my name down on your list of waiting suitors. It worked out perfectly, as I had to travel quite a distance to get to you. But it was no matter, by the time I found parking in your beautiful neighbourhood, you were ready for me.   I know you treat all your people as well as you did me, but I felt so special! Your servers were so sweet, you offered me sparkling and regular water (what! that's awesome!), you never kept me waiting too long, you made sure I was beaming from ear to ear when my brunch arrived. You were perfect.   You cook an amazing meal too, Barque. The french toast was beyond anything I've ever had. The grilled cheese sandwich - divine. All my friends were impressed, and I knew I'd be hooked forever. I was so sad when we had to part ways, and I had to fly back to my end of the country. But don't worry, I'll be back in town soon. And when I come back, you can bet I'll be paying you another visit. In the meantime, take care - bask in the glory that is Toronto's 6th best restaurant in 2012 (Toronto Life Magazine) but don't forget about me!  With love, Theresa"}
{"text":"I had to book my reservation for Saturday at 7PM over 2 weeks in advance, and now I understand why.  The food at barques was amazing!!!  My boyfriend and I shared a sampler for 2. It came with 3 types of meat and 3 sides. We had:  Beer ribs 5/5 - perfectly cooked, so tender and delicious. Didn't even need the extra sauce.  12 hour brisket- 5/5 omg! Melt in your mouth delicious.  Chicken 5/5 juicy and perfect.   Sides: Potatoe salad 4/5 - I prefer a creamy potato salad.  Smoked asparagus - 5/5  Carrot slaw -5/5 crunchy and delicious   The portion sizes were just right. Ieft feeling full but not overly stuffed. The service was great, but the desert took a bit too long to come out.   For desert my boyfriend had some sort of pie which he really liked but I found too sweet.  Also there is delicious, addictive popcorn at the table when you arrive.  I highly recommend barque smokehouse."}
{"text":"Disappointing BBQ!  Brisket was dry.  Pork ribs tough and under cooked.  Dry wings were, wait for it, too dry.  Not one piece of bacon in my Caesar salad.  Hush puppies were flavourless, dry and inedible.   Sausage was good - nice flavour and juicy.  Brussels sprouts were great! Love the sweet and salty flavour contrast.   $85 for all this food! Never again."}
{"text":"Formation music video came out today and I went out to Barque, can this day get any better ! Great service , large portions. Upscale bbq joint with a rustic feel. I love the fact that they take your jacket when you arrive.  We ordered the platter for 2 .I also ordered desert cause it was bae's birthday the swiss role cake it was ok.    I will be back  to try the bread pudding. Its great for date night , dinner with friends , 1st date all sorts of occasions its that kind of place. Cant wait to try the bar a few doors down next time"}
{"text":"I am glad I brought (fairly finicky) friends here.  Each couple ordered the Dinner for 2 with choice of meat.  The beef ribs and brisket are absolutely perfect - juicy, tender, not overly saucy.  Service was pretty good but we had to wait 20mins for our reservation, which was annoying, but they comped our drinks so I was happy.  We were all very satisfied despite the fact that the crazy women at the table next to us would not stop staring at us intensely. Bugger off, weirdos.  Would return with guests in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Had brunch here on a Sunday morning around 10:30am.  No wait for a table.  I was impressed.  First of all, who doesn't like brunch.  I ordered fried egg skillet and my girlfriend had the barque benedict.  Both highly recommended.  The egg skillet has chorizo sausage in it and is heavy and greasy, just the what I expected for a hangover cure.  You get a choice of brisket or smoked salmon with the benedict.  We went for the brisket.  It was delicious but could have used a bit more hollandaise. Both come with a leafy green salad which does a decent job of convincing you you're not eating 1000 calories.  Coffee is served in neat old mugs that came from the 80s and 90s.  They have weird books on the shelves on how to cook with microwaves.  The whole restaurant smells like a cast iron frying pan.  The only downside was the coffee was meh... but what did I expect?"}
{"text":"So far just had their chicken wings and poutine for take-out. Wow. One of the best wings I've ever had!  The sweet heat was tasty with a little bite and the chipotle was spicy enough to satisfy yet nor so much as to verge into painful. Will definitely go again, and maybe for sit down.  I've taken one star away because their online ordering system, on my iPhone, always froze just after choosing what I wanted and going to pay.  You should look into your mobile site, guys."}
{"text":"I tried one of their sandwiches at a street festival ages ago, so I was very excited when I found out this place now does delivery. Ever since Phil's closed,  the neighborhood has lacked solid BBQ.     We ordered the sampler for two, which has three meats and three sides. I was not overly impressed. The brisket was nice, and the ribs were good but the portions were small for the price.  1/3 rack of ribs and enough brisket for one sandwich isn't what comes to mind when a dinner is advertised as being a platter for \"two\" people.   I didn't care for the sausage: I found it had too much fennel. It was akin to eating meat liquorice. I don't dislike fennel but I found this overpowering.    The sides were also a bit of a letdown. The potatoes and cauliflower came in \"small fry\" sized boxes. These were single portions. Potatoes are cheap, so at least give your customers a big portion of those.    The cauliflower was supposed to be in a cream sauce, but what we received came with a paltry amount of oily, watery, white liquid in the very bottom of the box.    The asparagus was fine, but nothing so exciting that I couldn't have made myself.   We also got an order of wings, which tasted great, but once again, I was expecting more than 8 small wings for $12.    If I were to order from here again, I would probably just stick to a brisket or chicken sandwich. But that is a pretty big \"if\" given the price we spent for a so-so meal."}
{"text":"Came here for weekend brunch with a friend and loved it. I will be back to try the dinner menu!  The host and servers were friendly, despite the rush. A couple ahead of us in line seemed upset at the wait (1 hourish) but it was prime brunchtime on one of the brunchiest streets, so I couldn't really complain. We didn't have to wait too long before we got a seat at the bar.  We ordered coffee, smoked duck pancakes and brie apple ginger french toast. The duck pancakes were my favourite, and normally I don't even like pancakes that much. I got them because everyone around me seemed to be eating them and I didn't want to miss out. Pancake peer pressure. They deserve all the praise they've been getting though....the combo of smoked duck + goat cheese + blueberry is perfect. Get them!"}
{"text":"There's much better BBQ in Toronto.   Honestly, this city offers better BBQ in other locations. Enjoyed dinner at Barque yesterday. We (2 of us) sat comfortably at the bar, as we didn't have a reservation, and the place was hopping at 6:30 on a Wednesday night. The bartender was friendly and helpful - so service was all good.  The food, on the other hand, is really just ok.  If you're really looking for BBQ choices and excellent grub, this isn't the place. We had wings (hot chipotle), brisket, poutine, mac n cheese, and a half rack of ribs.   First the good news - the ribs were quite good - although I really don't get the idea of offering up sauces on the side. There are 3 choices of sauce available when you order. It's time to commit. When you eat pasta in an Italian restaurant, they don't bring the sauce options on the side, do they? Anyway, the meat came off the bone just the way it should. And they were nice and tender, not fatty at all.   The wings - yich. Gummy, practically uncooked. My fault for not ordering the dusted wings. But really, the wings should still be cooked, regardless of what sauce or spice they're using. Just bad - don't order wings unless you're getting the dusted ones, like the people did next to us. The moment I saw those I realized my mistake. Barque's mistake - offering these wings in their restaurant. Really, anyone can do better at home.  The poutine - sure, it was good, not great, but good.  Mac n Cheese - well, I've upped my personal game on this, so what I ate last night is just average. You can't take basic mac n cheese, toss some panko on it, and dish it up as anything special. You can do that with KD. Kind of seemed like that.  Brisket, somewhat tasty, but fairly dry. Sure, meats can be a little hit and miss, but relying on the squirt bottles of sauce on the counter to boost the flavour and moisture content isn't appropriate.   Notable misses on the menu to really be in the BBQ game: Beef ribs, fried chicken, onion rings.   As for the bar menu itself - yikes - I have more spirit options at home. Seriously, everyone knows that bourbon and BBQ are synonymous. Well, not here, with just 4 average options to choose from. Up your bar game, BARque."}
{"text":"If you're coming here for brunch, definitely come before Noon and don't bring a big group- 4 ppl should be max. Any more and you'd have to wait more than an hour- which is what happened to the 5 of us on a Sunday. That definitely marred our experience a little.   I loved my Smoked Duck Pancakes on Blueberry compote with chevre cheese- it was a great balance of sweet and savory. But my friends who had the egg benedict with brisket thought it was just OK.   Great space, friendly service, but LONG waits for brunch"}
{"text":"Barque has become one of my favourite restaurants in the city. I had the same server twice, who provided excellent service each time - even giving us a complimentary glass of champagne for our occasion (and allowing us to serve our own cake).   Highlights: smokey kettle corn on the tables, sampler platters, dry rubbed wings, brisket, FRENCH FRIES (trust me, they're better than average), Q water, basting brushes w sauces.. list goes on."}
{"text":"okay 3 things -  ribs, beef brisket, chicken wings.  all to DIE for. expect meat sweats  they start you off with a tin of flavoured popcorn.  It's cool and all but i found it rather stale and didnt care for it.  ended up dipping it in the bbq sauce they gave us lol probably a little gross   been here twice. first time - had the sampler for two with the beef ribs (its 1 huge rib that was super good, fall off the bone, great seasoning. I would def get it again), chicken ( it wasn't dry but it was a little bland. nothing great), sweet heat baby back ribs (HORRIBLE, it was dry and hard.  Trying to cut it with a knife was basically impossible and I got a cramp in my arm from it) **NOTE - i came here a second time after and the baby back ribs i had were HEAVEN, so i think its hit and miss, not sure, but seriously my first time it was really bad and the second time was amazing sides I had broccolini, creamy smoked cauliflower (this is fantastic and I would get it again for sure), and the squash with brussel sprouts  (there was one small piece of squash and the rest was brussel sprouts, really good though)  second time- so when you come with 4 or more ppl they have a special menu that changes (weekly?) for a fixed price of $35. we ate the most food this night so let me randomly throw some stuff out. We ordered extra sides of fries (OH MY GOD so good ) and the ceasar salad (wouldn't order it again). okay I dont like  wings normally but these wings had the PERFECT seasoning on it. SO GOOD!!! they are dry wings tho, no sauce. The beef brisket is AMAZING, tender perfection, i wanted more. the menu came with baby back ribs against my will, but i decided to try the dry rub ones this time. BAM wtf i had a totally different experience.  this time it was the BEST ribs i have ever had in my life. the seasoning wtf I don't know what it was but it was mouth watering and the ribs were fall off the bone perfection.   if you come here just be sure to try the sampler for 1 or 2 so u get a taste of everything. and if you come with 4 or more ppl make sure you eat from their special menu.  It is ALOT of food for a great price."}
{"text":"The pulled pork, decorations and music was nice. The greek fries did not taste good. The attitude of person who served was not good and there were flies."}
{"text":"Arrived at 5pm and was seated promptly. If you don't have a reservation or don't like waiting in line, it's really the only time to go.   Service was fantastic the entire evening. The table had a complimentary bucket of smoked popcorn that my kids loved!! I wish I could say the same for the food. We ordered 2 sampler platters for 2 and decided to try share all the greatness we've been reading about.   Everything arrived at the table fast and looking delicious. The first major disappointment was the brisket, chicken thighs and ribs (beef and bark rack o bama) were all lukewarm to cold. I would have expected them to be smoking hot! The sausage was the only meat that tasted like it just came out of the smoker! Extremely disappointing!   For the sides, we enjoyed them all! Kale salad, fries, pasta etc and found them all to be above average.   For dessert, my kids had the gelato and cookies and we shared a new menu item, Caramelized Apple cake with pumpkin and Caramel. While the flavours were interesting, the portion size didn't justify the $9 price tag.   Overall, we loved the decor, vibe and service. The food on this night was just meh.  With so many bbq joints opening across the city, I may or may not try this again."}
{"text":"Lovely variety of food for meat lovers. Tried the schorizo and the sampler platter as well as the beef brisket, they were all amazing. Don't forget the cajun mac and cheese. Finally Patio was amazing but avoid the 1st table at entrance of the patio."}
{"text":"Lovely ambience along with great food!! Sampler platter is the best !!! Will go back for sure!!"}
{"text":"We arrived and were promptly seated at the bar, it was a packed house! Service was quick and friendly. I split the sample platter for two with my girlfriend which we selected the brisket, chicken, and baby back ribs....  Brisket was tender and flavorful but definitely not as juicy as I've had, and it was all cut up. Serve it either pulled or let me pull it apart with my fork!  Chicken was only OK. The sauce and glazing were good but definitely under-marinated. The meat wasn't very tasty. Ribs were tasty, again wasn't as flavorful as I've had in the past.   Sides we got the cauliflower, penne, and roasted asparagus...Why was everything cold? That being said the penne and asparagus tasted awesome, always good add pancetta to pasta! The cauliflower was good too but the sauce was way too watery and runny.  Overall food 3.5, round up to a four for service."}
{"text":"When I found out my brother would be coming to town, I knew this was where I wanted to bring him.  Last time he had come to the city, I had taken him to another bbq joint.  Him being a \"tried and true\" kinda guy, he wanted to go back to that one.  But, I'm a big fan of trying new places so I thought I'd take a chance and encourage him to trust my selection.    We arrived right on time for our reservation on a Friday night, and were greeted by a very friendly host, then an equally friendly server.  I have no complaints about the service here, they were definitely on point.    I knew from reading reviews and the online menu that I wanted to do the sampler platter - I'm always in favour of trying as many things as possible.  Warning for future dining companions: I will try your food.  Possibly whether you want me to or not.  But I'll return the favour and will always offer a bite of mine!    Back to the food.  We chose the brisket, spicy baby back ribs, and beef ribs for the meat; the smoked asparagus, gnocchi, and Caesar salad for the sides.  But alas, they weren't able to offer beef ribs.    It turned out we weren't at all sorry for missing out on the beef ribs because the chicken was absolutely delicious.  Even my brother, who usually prefers white meat, just gobbled it up.  The baby back ribs had a building heat to them, and they were very tasty.  My definite favourite was the brisket.  It just melted in my mouth.  Absolutely fantastic.  The gnocchi was just okay.  The tomato sauce it was in was nothing special, it didn't really have any flavour except that of the tomatoes.  The salad was good, but again nothing out of the ordinary.  The asparagus though...now that was something different.  It actually tasted like smoke.  I wasn't sure if I liked that or not, and to be honest I'm still not sure.  My brother thought it was fantastic though.  So, to each their own on that one.    I really enjoyed the country-kitchen-esque décor.  Lots of wood is always a plus in my books.  I will definitely return for the beef ribs.  Oh and my brother?  He definitely wasn't complaining that I had insisted on trying somewhere new."}
{"text":"After a tedious 5 hour flight from California to Toronto, the first thing on my agenda was gettin' some grub in my belly! Thankfully I did some homework before I arrived in the city and had a list of happy eats to try out once I was in town.   First on that list was Barque Smokehouse. Cuz no matter where I am, I always will have a hankering for tasty BBQ!    I've heard the wait for a seat here could be obnoxious but as luck would have it, there was ample bar seating when we arrived at 9pm! Hazzah!   Our bartender poured us up a nice cold draft as we perused the one page menu.  I wasted no time in asking for her suggestions, which she kindly offered.    And here's what we tried:  Bacon Caesar - not your everyday Caesar salad by any means. Topped with thick cuts of crispy, savory bacon and mixed with chopped romaine, fresh grated Parmesan and a luscious Caesar dressing. It was a decadent mouthful of bacon goodness in every bite!   Baby back ribs - Underneath the crust of perfectly smoked caramelization, was juicy \"fall off the bone\" deliciousness. The rub had a nice lip smacking kick to it, which I really enjoyed, as well. No need to slather this beauty with extra BBQ sauce it because it was finger lickin good all on its own!  Omg the mashed potatoes were simply divine. Buttery fluffy and rich, this hearty mash should have been illegal! Seriously didn't just eat it, I inhaled it! As if it couldn't get any better, the added crispy onion fries nestled on top made it one awesome mash to remember!   Beef rib - This gargantuan monstrosity was beyond enormous!!! I was initially daunted by its size but my unyielding hunger gave me the courage to tackle this beast! After the first bite, of course, I simply couldn't put it down!  And the brisket, ooooh the brisket! It was tender, juicy, flavorful and everything I could ever want in this popular cut! Easily the best brisket I've ever had!  My only gripe? Wish they weren't located in Toronto!   In any case, if you're ever in town, pay the kind folks here a visit, I guarantee you won't be disappointed!   Happy Eats!"}
{"text":"I came here just the past Saturday and this go around was for dinner which is the real deal.  The last time I came was for lunch and the two services really don't compare to each other at all so I'm having to update my review based on the most recent experience.  This place needs reservations far in advance and is hard to get into for a reason.  Their meat servings are pretty impressive and for being in the competitive market of Parkdale/Roncy and old things becoming new again, Barque has really established itself with a fine product in an almost born again area.  There was a time when this stretch of Roncesvalles was just not as diverse but these days there's all sorts of food variety and Barque adds that much more to as I'd now probably consider them an anchor in the area when it comes to great dining.  While their bundle offerings like the Smoker's Choice (they would ask that if this is ordered that all at the table order it) and the Meet Meat platter don't allow for any types of substitutions while seeming a bit inflexible it's easy to understand.  This place pumps out lots of food and for as busy as it may be or become you can customize your own orders which is what we ended up doing since both bundle type platter services had items that not everyone wanted necessarily.  No worries, a la carte it is...  I had started with the smoked wings which came as a starter and my wife had wanted her mac and cheese as a starter as opposed to as side.  The mac and cheese was fine but for 10 bucks didn't really seem to be worth it.  The smoked wings while good were nicely spiced but I had them with a side of their version of chipotle which was hot but I did enjoy the sauce.  I can see how others would find it rather hot and their scale had it at two peppers.  Salad King pepper scale this it NOT.  There was about 6 wings or so, 12 bucks so that's about 2 bucks a piece.  Not bad but hey, I'm sort of a fried chicken lover so I can say I've had better.  Besides the starters which weren't that impressive you have to get to the meat and potatoes well in this case the meat.    The meat we ordered was a full rack of ribs \"Barque Rack O'Bama\" as they were called which is rubbed, smoked and double basted.  These ribs are the real deal.  While I pride myself on being able to make good ribs as well these are truly worth the wait and probably the best ribs I've had in a while besides my own that I make at home.  I have to say with the right amount of time, technique and ingredients these ribs are absolutely worthy of being 30 bucks a full rack.  To me, at that price for what they are, that is a steal!    I had also ordered 2 x 7 oz (ounces? we are in Canada yo!) orders of beef brisket.  The brisket was so flavorful, not too fatty and cooked to my liking.  The meat was not red but it sure wasn't overcooked either.  With the sauce on top these were sliced beef heaven on a platter.  That and the ribs on top...?  Quite the plate.  The entire plate of full rack of ribs and 2 large orders of brisket works out to be 56 bucks (30 + 13 + 13) to me is totally worth it.  This is enough meat for my wife, myself and my late night hunger.  While I had started with a St. Ambroise Pale Ale I later switched to the bacon rimmed medium spicy Caesars and I have to say that drink not only goes well with what we were eating but they were made well.  The bottom line is that to say Barque knows what they are doing would be an understatement.  They make good BBQ and they have a good variety of choices but the ribs and brisket are great.  I wasn't too much in the mood to try some of the other offerings although I like chorizo and they had pork etc but these two items IMO are key.  The next time we return (and we will be back I don't doubt it) whatever we order will be built around those two key menu items (ribs and brisket)."}
{"text":"Incredible place! Some of the best barbeque you can get in all of Toronto!! Not too pricey and very nice inside, but book well ahead of time as this place is very popular!! Must go to for sure if you like barbeque."}
{"text":"Planned a Friday night out with 2 boys, so I figure this would tailor to their manly appetites.  I was foolish and decided not to make a reservation - and as a result we ended up waiting 30 minutes only to get a table at the back bar.  We later glanced around and noticed many empty tables; why put us at the bar if there are tables?  The moment you walk into Barque's, the only aroma that permeates from your pores deep down to your bones is pork.  I felt like someone was using a brush and lathering me up with barbecue sauce.  But the smell made you want to sit down and devour a rack of ribs right away. Instead of the usual bread basket, you get a bucket of popcorn with their signature barbecue sauces: Kansas City and Carolina (Tomato based, and mustard/vinegar based).  Of the two, I definitely preferred the Kansas City one with its mesquite and sweet flavour.  The Carolina was a little too tart for me.   The popcorn was a great munchie as I sipped on my Barque Caesar with the maple-bacon brimmed cup.  However, I found it to be a little bit too \"tomato-sauce\" like and didn't end up finishing the drink.  I love tomatoes, just not that much in my drink.  We ordered 3 appetizers to share in order of preference: Brisket Poutine, Smoked Wings and Pulled Duck Tacos.   My favourite was the Brisket Poutine which was packed full of flavour.  You got the tenderness of the fries, with the barbecued and slightly sweet flavour from the brisket which was complemented by a gooey and salty cheese.  The seasoning almost tricked me into thinking I was eating sweet potato fries as the fries had a slightly sweet flavour to them.  Yummy!    We opted for the Spicy Chipotle Smoked Wings, and it left a fire that lingered for awhile long after I had finished these finger lickin' good wings. They were just lightly coated with batter, and the wings were juicy and tender.    And last, the Pulled Duck Tacos.  Whenever I think of duck the words that come to mind are crispy, juicy, moist, succulent and tender - some of which were lacking in Barque's rendition of a pulled duck taco.  The meat was dry and the skin was not crispy.  The actual taco itself was somewhere between a hard and soft-shell and was actually my favourite part of the dish.  The predominant flavour is definitely the Hoisin Sauce, which drowns out the pickled carrots and scallions.  I was most disappointed as this was one of the appetizers I was most looking forward to devouring.  I guess we'll leave tacos for the Gods at La Carnita!  For the main, we ordered the Sampler for 2 which consisted of 2 Competition Chicken Thighs, 1/2 Rack of Baby Back Ribs and Brisket.  This was also accompanied by your choice of 3 sides from which we chose: Squash Gnocchi, Pickled Platter and Barque Caesar Salad.  Of the mains, I enjoyed the ribs the most.  They were just the right texture (not too soft and not too firm), and were flavourful in their own right.  I as a purist, tried it first without a brushing of sauce, and it was tasty on its own.  My second favourite was the brisket, although I found their version to be a bit lean and hence not as juicy as I would've liked.  The brisket at Barque's goes through an intense 12 hour smoking process.  It is first smoked for 6 hours, then wrapped in aluminum foil and smoked for another 6 hours.  Now that is what I call a labour of love! Alas, the right texture of fat to meat is a matter of preference.  The chicken thighs had a very flavourful skin, and while moist and tender, I found the meat itself to be rather bland.  I would've preferred a more flavour-infused chicken that doesn't rely just on the skin for flavour.  My favourite side was the Squash Gnocchi.  My only regret was that I had to share this with my dining companions.  It was cooked to a perfect al dente, and the Asiago cheese made the dish absolutely rich and creamy.  The Barque Caesar came with caveman-sized croutons, bacon, cheese and dressing.  I thought it was perfectly dressed with just the right amount of dressing.  There is nothing worse than a salad that swims in dressing.  The croutons were perfectly crunchy and the bacon - well its bacon - when is that ever bad right?  The pickled platter was something I was really looking forward to trying and while I felt the acidity and tartness of the platter was slowly attacking and rinsing out the fat-laden entrees and appetizers I just finished devouring, it was not my cup of tea.  The beets were too hard, the dish was too salty, and altogether disappointing.  I personally prefer a hint of sweetness in my pickled anything, and that was probably what was lacking.  To finish off the evening, I had my heart set on the Pecan Pie served with Greg's Marshmallow Ice Cream.  Hands down the best pecan pie I've ever eaten. Gooey, not a sugar over-kill and the ice cream was heavenly."}
{"text":"WHOA! THIS PLACE IS AWESOME  Love the ribs, brisket, and fries. Even the salad was awesome.  Dry rub. It's all you need to know."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing staff. Definitely grab a sampler if you're not sure what to get. And if you like blue cheese try the polenta (but beware, it's not a subtle taste at all). As for the wait times, they're worth it, just plan in advance or come early."}
{"text":"Went to the Taste of Toronto 2015 and sampled Barque's food.  Probably not the best place to taste test restaurant food, but better than behind a dumpster.  In short order the chicken was not cooked fully, and tasted and handled like gelatinous fat.  The corn was soggy, and the beef  ribs were just ok.  I went back to have the chicken replaced, so I could actually get an idea of what I could be missing, but the male server in the booth said Barque brines their chicken, and the chicken is supposed to be like that.  I disagreed, and finally got a better cooked piece of meat.  Again, just ok.  I may go to the actual location to sample the ribs, but then again I'll probably just do my own BBQ."}
{"text":"I think it's a little overhyped. Not to mention it took over 2 months for our group of 8 to get a reservations and still ended up with a time that was not ideal (8pm on thursday night).  If you're planning on going, book at least a month before hand.   Actually, we had a reservation for their sunday night family style dinner, which I think it's a great idea to get people in the door. It's quite gimmicky though, because almost anything can be family style, you just need to put it in the middle and SHARE. This is a set menu that changes weekly, and unfortunately that day in Feb when we booked it, it was a chinese style menu with offerings that didn't seem reflective of their slow cooked bbq style (the main reason we wanted to try)  All that aside, we finally made it on a Thursday night at 8pm, and it was packed full. They do save space for walk-ins, but makes no sense for me when I was told you still need to wait an hour. Maybe those no-reservation restaurants have the right idea.   Our server was friendly, although only showed up to take our order, and give us our bill. Flagging her down was almost impossible after 9pm. (We left at ten, and it was still bustling with people).   My hubby was instantly impressed with the sparkling water, and regular water choices on the table and comp popcorn bucket to munch on while waiting for the meal. The sparkling water never came back during refills - I wonder if it was an error.   FOOD They have a great sampler menu for both the appetizers (changes daily) and their bbq fare. It's the best way to try their specialties.  For two people, you can totally go with a sampler for one - but also order an appetizer to share. You'll have plenty room for dessert.   We ended up ordering the Barque Plate - a changing special of different small things as apps. There was a big chicken taco (chicken breast moist and juicy), brisket fritter, pita with hummus and supposedly shrimp and dip but they ran out and we got some roasted nuts (which were amazing) instead.  This was pretty filling already.   The sampler for one - 1/3 rack of baby back ribs, one giant beef rib, and beef brisket (which I think we got a significantly smaller piece than my friends, but could not prove that even with all the pictures I take with food). You can also choose 2 sides, we got the roasted asparagus and fries.   Brisket and Beef Rib was the best, but the baby back ribs lacked flavour. Overall the entire thing did not wow me, compared to say Electric Mud BBQ. The worst part was, since my hubby decided not to share this sampler with me (since the meal was so late he already ate dinner) - I had to finish it myself. It was like when I was kid, I felt obligated to finish even though I was stuffed. Too much talking, not enough eating: food got cold.   As for decor, it was fun and had a great energy. Hated the mirrors on the back wall, facing them and my DPs was weird. Also (and I'm the only one that seems to care about these things) the table was slightly higher than the chairs, and sitting there wasn't comfy for me.   It was OK. But there are better bbq places in TO, namely my backyard is comparable."}
{"text":"Droolssss, I love BBQ so of course I'd love Barque Smokehouse. I came here in the spring and my fiancé and I really enjoyed it. Although it is a little crammed inside the ambience is still great. We got the sampler for two which included 3 meats and 3 sides which was more than enough food for two people! For meats we tried the brisket, beef as well as baby back ribs. The brisket had to be my favourite since I'm quite new to brisket, it was the right amout of sweet+heat. As our sides we enjoyed the gemelli pasta which was totally yummmm and the cauliflower Au gratin (no longer on menu)   Definitely a spot to check out if you're in the park dale area whether you want some grub or just a quick beer."}
{"text":"Super friendly place in Roncy. It's obviously a very popular spot and well known. It's taken me awhile to finally visit but I can see why it is! Came here for a brunch, and while it was a half hour to closing, it was still full and people were walking in with me.  There's so many yummy options on the menu, but I decided right off the bat to try the breakfast poutine with a fried egg on top. My partner ordered the 5 bone baby back ribs with the fries. OHMYDAYS. I haven't tried the ribs, but the poutine and the fries were amazing. The fries had this amazing seasoning. We also had a couple of drinks, a mimosa and a \"smoke and choke,\" a fancy bourbon sour.  The were playing old school X-Men episodes on the TV while we were having brunch, which reminded us of being up early on Saturdays for the good morning cartoons as kids. Overall, we really enjoyed our meal, our service and our time there.  I will definitely be coming back, however, I was so ridiculously stuffed after this meal, that even at dinner time I could barely eat much. BE PREPARED TO FEEL FULL. But super satisfied ;)"}
{"text":"This is easily one of my favourite new places in the city.  We recently went with six people where we all shared and ordered just about everything. Heaven I tell you.  The lamb ribs with the pomegranite sauce are so delicious. It is a shame this is not offered as a main.   The chicken fingers, yes, chicken fingers are fantastic. They are not on the dinner menu but at time they will still allow you to order them for dinner.  Of the mains the brisket is hands down the best option. My friends who said they don't like sausage have now found a sausage they love. The ribs were a bit dry but the smoked chicken is beautiful.  Finally the cold smoked bourbon is gorgeous and the pecan pie could be the best dessert option."}
{"text":"Overview: great smoke BBQ sauce,  good  atmosphere,  dry meats   Came here on a saturday night.  They were fully booked so joined the waiting list and killed time at their sister restaurant a couple of units down Barbeque Bar. The staff here were great and the host seated us right in front of the big screen for they jays game as requested! Ordered half rack of ribs (barque rack O'bama sauce),  7oz brisket,  and the fennel sausage. The sauce is a true smokehouse sauce,  smoke with a tang and kick. Ribs were good,  I found a bit more dry than other places but the sauce makes up for it.  The brisket and the sausage were dry,  and therefore would not oder again.  The brisket was also cut thicker than most smoke houses. Finished off with the pecan per with the cinnamon gelato.  Could have had a bowl of the gelato alone and been happy. Overall ribs were good but I don't think I'll be coming back.  Hogtown smoke and stack have just as good ribs and other fixings to choose from."}
{"text":"Friday evening rolls around and we're craving something different than the standard sushi and Thai in our area - we've been wanting to try out Barque for a while and finally made an executive decision to make it happen.  Thought about making a quick reservation but there was nothing available so we did take out (and when I went to pick it up, it confirmed there was NOTHING available - the place was packed!)  We had the ribs with the sweet heat sauce - the ribs were really nice and I'd like to try them again but with the barque sauce they make in-house. We also had the brisket -- which I thought would be better but maybe it's because I spent so much time in Texas that makes me so picky about brisket. Next time I'd like to try the pulled pork in exchange for brisket. And as sides we did the mac & cheese and potato salad. Both I absolutely loved. They even put a little bag of tasty popcorn in, which we consumer the following day.   Definitely a place to try!!"}
{"text":"A very complex (in a good way) breakfast (brunch), which will keep you full for the rest of the day. This isn't your traditional bacon / ham diner that serves 24 hour breakfast that has grease spilling off the plate.   The food is as delicious as the menu suggests. My only complaint is that they don't have just plain bacon and eggs. I was informed that they would accommodate my provincial request, but I opted to allow my palate enjoy the moment.   I'll have to run the next few days and bike everyday until my next meal here , as I think I over indulged."}
{"text":"This place lives up to the hype. Probably my favorite restaurant in Toronto right now. The food is delicious, the price is reasonable and the service is incredible. It doesn't really get much better.   If it's your first time get the sample platter - it gives you a pretty healthy selection of some of their best selections."}
{"text":"Love the brisket and chicken. Ribs are hit or miss but we generally enjoy the food. They are also great with kids - check them out on Sunday if you have kids as its family day. They definitely know how to keep toddlers entertained with play doh."}
{"text":"Favourite restaurant in Toronto at the moment - amazing value for money and special touches like the complimentary popcorn and bubbly water add this impression. Food is super tasty and the Texas bbq sauce is worth taking home.   Only issues I have are with having a TV behind the bar, which destroys atmosphere if you can see it, and with wasps in the summer - they flock to the smell of the meat and make the patio and window seats rather nervy for those who dislike the pesky insects."}
{"text":"So this place at one time was the best in town worth the insanity of being over booked for weeks in advance. Worth dealing with the snotty kid a the door asking if I have a \"Reso\" (yes I always had a \"reservation\" unless getting take out, then I call ahead) with  that \"meh\" attitude. You know the one. Always packed with blonde chicks  from like Oakville or something (Sorry Oakvillians you're my negatively connoted scapegoat of the day) The food is still just as good as it was. Sides OK not spectacular. Meat is spectacular. But to be honest they just suffered from a lack of competition for a long time. Not any more.Oh, and that \"Reso\" guy is the reason my \"super important to everyone\" review is for three and not four stars. I haven't seen him there in a while so I guess I should give them back their star cause the food really is four star, but you know... Meh."}
{"text":"I'm really starting to think that people's tastes are in their ass. Best bbq on Toronto...NOT...  The ribs were the best part though I got no smoke flavor... Brisket was crap... Chewy and gross.. Popcorn.... Stale That weird deep fried smoked chicken thigh was a disaster.... How does this place get such rave reviews???? Oh yeah because the typical pallet compares this place to Swiss Chalet and not real BBQ in Texas or Missouri... Cmon Toronto, get your head out of your ass!!!"}
{"text":"I was attempting to use Barque to cater for my wedding reception.  After many attempts at communication back and forth and constant following up on my end only to get apologies and excuses as to how busy they were (then don't agree to cater!) I had one final attempt at a follow up looking to obtain a final quote and never received a response so I finally gave up.  This is all after they confirmed they could do the event.  The customer service for catering was extremely horrible and to be honest even if they did finally respond their lack of timeliness made me uncomfortable with whether they'd show up on time or at all on the day of!  Too bad, I had high hopes."}
{"text":"This is a review solely for their pulled pork on bbq fries I tried at their festival booths. Had it twice within one weekend. Delicious. Decent amount of pork I would say for the additional $4. Will need to visit their storefront to try their other smoked and bbq'd food."}
{"text":"I'm lucky to have this place super close to where i work ;) Can't promise that i'll be too productive afterwards though!  We sat on the patio that day and the servers were all so welcoming and the service was generally good in my opinion!  Food was great also! We had a large party and i was able to see a good variety of food that they served! i had the smoked trout sandwich which was amazing...the fish wasn't dry and was super tender... i was also able to choose corn on a cob as a side! yum! although, all the health nuts out there, beware! it is super buttery!!   others ordered the beef brisket sandwich or the burger... and i think overall they said it was delicious as well! :) happy with this one for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is great, especially now that they accept reservations. Love the vibe but waiting in line can be torturous. Food is solid. The beef ribs are very tasty and just the right texture. Their burger at lunch is epic... People ask me why is go there just to eat a burger but it is sooo good. They are very proud of their brisket but I find it dry and boring. The sides here are all very solid- the fries are crunchy and golden and worth the calories, the kale salad is good and the Brussels sprouts with pomegranate is tres yummy. Service is unpretentious and there is a good beer selection ( less with wine).  Great place!"}
{"text":"The star of the show here is obviously the barbeque itself, and on that level, they ace it.  Among the group we dined with, we had nearly every meat on the menu (save the Stout Sausage), and they were excellent, juicy, fall-off-the-bone, well-spiced.  A few at our table questioned whether everything had to have the spice-rub all over it, and to be fair, it did show up on nearly all the items (including the fries), but I didn't find it overdone, and personally rather liked it.  The salads and sides were good, but not as stellar as the meat.  The one stand-out was the Caesar with candied bacon.  The waitstaff were great, friendly, accommodating, and fast.  I probably would've joined a lot of my fellow reviewers with a 5-star rating, except for the hostess and what I think may have been the manager.  Both of them had a sour expression from the beginning of our time there to our exit and seemed put out by just about everything going on around them (not just us).  I don't need you to smile like a fool, or for that matter, crack a smile at all, I understand how hectic things can get in a popular restaurant, but please make an effort to make your patrons feel welcome, instead of making them feel like they're putting you out in some way."}
{"text":"Really? What's all the hype about? The food was terrible. Too much bad to list."}
{"text":"The brunch here is to die for. I've been making my way through all that Toronto barbecue has to offer and Barque has secured a special place in my search already. This is saying alot seeing as I haven't even had a chance to try the ribs yet. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Perfect place to catch up with a friend or a brunch date with your significant other over barque's savory and and sweet menu.   Loved the furnishings and atmosphere. Mixed with low and high top tables.   They even play cartoons on their tv on Sunday afternoon! It was pretty distracting...who doesn't like cartoons! They also offer complimentary sparkling water!  Decided to come here since a friend raved about how awesome their pancakes were and it was quite different indeed. Definitely not a die hard fan of the duck pancakes but I sure am for their 12 hour brisket sandwich!  Will come back for their smokin bbq dinner!"}
{"text":"td:dr - I suffered yet another (delicious) meat coma... this time at Barque Smokehouse. I'm beginning to sense trend here. You?  Holy moly. This place was epically good! I went here with my lady friend.  She was feeling like some BBQ, which surprised me as she's normally more about more high brow experiences. Anyhoo, Barque Smokehouse is quite a popular destination in Roncesvalles Village, and it's not surprising that we had to wait about half an hour before we could get seating at the bar (not a big deal to us as it was still really fun) amongst the close to 200 epic reviews for Barque as well.    It wasn't a big deal though as they took our number and said they'd call back within half an hour, and we discovered Ed's Real Scoop had just opened the very same day a block south (read my review there - that place is awesome too!).  Upon sitting down, there was a complimentary mini-bucket of bbq popcorn (who woulda thunk eh?), which was a nice surprised to hold our hungry stomachs over until we received our food.  I had ordered the Sample Platter for 1 which featured their brisket, sausage, and 1/3 rack of baby bak ribs with a dry rub.   My two sides were the root slaw and roasted cauliflower.  Words cannot explain how delicious and succulent their BBQ is!!!! I mean seriously, it was divine medley of meats and sides that were so juicy and bursting with flavour.  I almost felt guilty as I was washing down all that deliciousness with my favourite beer, Steam Whistle.  Our server was also the bartender, she had just the right level of charm and attentiveness to make the dining experience, even though we were seated at the bar, just flow.  Had I not been driving, I would have been tempted to try out their cocktail menu.  To my surprise, it turned out to be earth hour as well that night we went, so they turned off all the lights put out candles strewn across the entire restaurant which was quite how they say in France... \"romantique\"? ;)  Buuuut we were eating BBQ, which kinda balanced it out for a ruffian like myself.  All in all, the end result was my falling into a meat coma and having delicious dreams of the BBQ I had just experienced.  I will definitely be visiting Barque's once it becomes patio season.  Bon appetit!"}

{"text":"I am famous for being the fussiest customer. That's because I was born to and worked in the industry and I am awesome cook (toot toot).  Barque blow my socks off!  I did not have a single complaint. The beer was fresh. I had my first glass of 'tap' wine and it was surprisingly good. We were there on Sunday lunch so we were limited to the brunch menu. We share the brisket sandwich and the fried chicken sandwich. Ed instantly regretted giving me half his chicken sandwich. I love dill sauce and it was a great combo on this sandwich   I am a finger eater so I deconstructed my brisket sandwich and found the meat to be far more tender this way (didn't have to chew through the red cabbage. I am not a fan)  I would highly recommend Barque to all fussy eaters. I will be back to compare their smoked wings to mine!"}
{"text":"Really, really, seriously good bbq...wonderful ambience, great service.  Sampler platters are the ticket.  3 meats and 2 sides, try brussel sprouts and wheat berry salad.  To die for and then ya get the meat.  So tender, tasty ,juicy and delicious.  Well done!"}
{"text":"I'm torn. We initially loved to go to this place all the time because, seriously people, this BBQ is damn good. But the service!! What gives? I get you're busy. I get people will likely always eat at your restaurant because the food rocks (other than the beef rib & chicken) and you really couldn't have a better location, but that doesn't give you the right to treat your customers like we are annoying you. What kind of place gives a window for a reservation? A walk in (which you keep 1/2 the place open for), yes, you can tell them they have to be out by a certain time, but a reservation that I made a month ago that we were on time for? You give me attitude because we aren't ordering fast enough? Heaven forbid I should want to take my time and enjoy your food. And what else do I have to say to get a decent table? You give me the armpit of the restaurant right by the door when I told you 3 times (1x in writing, 2x on the phone) it was a 30th Bday dinner and you can see through your reservation system we are regulars? You think that might warrant a nicer table. But this is just coming from a person with 10+ years in restaurants, so what do I know about good customer experience.  I think we might be done with this place... Good riddance!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed myself here thoroughly I was on another website where they featured stuff I could get. Sadly I went on a day that they didn't serve these items and or I guess it was the timing. Either way the food was still amazing! Minus one part but ill get to that near the end  Wait staff was polite, friendly and welcoming. I wish our waitress was the same and I wish she had asked if it was our first time as sometimes its intimidating saying so. I wished she had recommended the pancakes that looked so savory sitting next to us! :( But what I ended up with was really good too! started with an arugula salad, and then smoked barque burger, bf had the same thing...Had to admit we were really hungry and we ordered the half rack of baby back ribs after all that was why we were going there... and two sides salad again and fries again.  It probably would have been really good had it been served right away while it was hot. When we got it, it was warm but not hot closer to it feeling like it was left for a while when it was ready. My bf didn't want to return it because we had waited already for it and if it gets re heated it would just make it tougher to eat.   I would like to go back again but this time for dinner as I saw a drink that they rimmed with baccon! BACON! omg! lol overall place is great!  Parking is on the street making sure you read those signs!!! Bring coins or have a credit card ready!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal service and delicious food! We had a surprise baby shower for a friend during Sunday brunch. We were a total of 8 adults and three babies (including car seats and strollers). The staff were extremely patient and accommodating. We had stayed for awhile and throughout the entire time, the staff had provided excellent service.  I had the Barque Benedict with Citrus Smoked Salmon and kale salad. I loved how they served salad at brunch. Rarely do restaurants provide vegetables during brunch and Barque gave a generous amount of kale. Also, the salad didn't even need any dressing, the kale was so sweet!   Our experience at Barque was so positive. We all agreed we would definitely go back.  Thanks everyone at Barque!"}
{"text":"I'm trying to watch my calories, so I was a little nervous about having lunch at Barque. Would it be possible for me to eat something reasonably healthy when surrounded by such succulent barbecue delights? As it turns out, it's totally possible -- and totally tasty, too. I had a spinach salad, which was lightly dressed and mixed in with a little bit of goat cheese, tomatoes, and candied pecans (okay, not that healthy, but still awesomely delicious). Adding the smoked shrimp is definitely the way to go -- the shrimp is perfectly cooked and a good protein to pair with the salad. I also loved the Cuban Corn, which is grilled corn with a spicy spread. The only sour note is that it's rather pricey; the spinach salad plus shrimp is $14, which is a little out of my range for a casual weekday lunch.   The service was great, and their patio is a great place to enjoy a sunny day. I definitely hope to be back when I can guiltlessly indulge in the rest of the offerings on the menu."}
{"text":"Place looks amazing, waitress were very friendly. Came to our table and there was a pail of complimentary popcorn!!! We were offered complimentary still or sparkling.   We got the sampler for two with the two different ciders.   Starter we have pulled pork poutine: pulled pork was filled with flavours, the fries had a sweetness to it.   They even swapped our app plates after our starter!!  Ribs: flavours for the ribs r great but I wish there was a little more sauce.  Lamb shoulder: flavours are on the outside not much in the centre  Brisket: great taste n juicy because it has the fat there. If not it would be too dry.   Cajun corn: was too charcoaled, all I could taste was the charcoal n Cajun sauce.    Asparagus: too much pepper.  Overall my experience was great! But the only thing that I saw and was iffy about was how they just refilled the still water bottles from other tables without cleaning them... like if the finished cleaning the table and that bottle was half full they just fill it back up to the top. I've only seen then do it one week and the rest seems like they got fresh bottles from under the counter."}
{"text":"Ribs were dry and stringy but had nice flavour. Chicken was excellent, moist with great flavour. Brisket was juicy and flavorful. Duck tacos were drowned in hoisin sauce. We asked for a take out order of brisket with extra sauce, and when we got home and looked in the bag, there was no sauce whatsoever. We all thought it was good, but would not rush back. Service was very slow and took a really long time to get our food."}
{"text":"BBQ in Canada? Most definitely! Solid, first rate barbecue. Everything deliciously scratch made in house. Smoked chicken wings with their \"299\" dry rub were outrageous as were the ribs and brisket. Desserts were excellent - not too sweet to overpower the tastebuds after the spectacular meal."}
{"text":"A popular staple in the High Park area as it was quite busy when we arrived but luckily we had reservations. It's also quite a smaller restaurant venue but we finally got our table after 10 minutes. They have a good selection of brunch items and their specialty here is definitely their meat. I ordered the Barque Benedict with the pommery pulled pork; cornbread, poached eggs, bbq hollandaise, homefries and kale salad which was $16. Not a bad price point for their brunch menu item. I have to stay I was extremely satisfied on what I ordered. Their meat was perfectly cooked and delicious and their benny was nice and runny. What impressed me even more was their kale salad- which was probably the best one I've had in recent memory. I would highly recommend ordering this when you come here for brunch. Our waitress was friendly and nice and the food came out pretty quickly. If you are looking for a really good brunch place in High Park, this is the one."}
{"text":"Color me skeptical of Northern barbecue, but despite the advice I'd give to most Candadian restauteurs to avoid even trying to attempt the pinnacle of cuisine, barbecue, other than to overlay pulled pork on poutine Barque succeeds.    Kansas City born and bred I'm a ribs boy so in our sampler for two, we opted for BOTH beef and baby back pork ribs, in addition to some not quite Texas style brisket.  The ribs were super delicious (5 out of 5 Canadian scale, 3.9 out of 5 on the KC scale).   It also came with copious sides, vegetables, and even the seasonally awesome Canadian touch of fiddleheads.   We did have to wait awhile at a nearby bar but the hostess recorded everything on an iPad and gave us a call on our cell phone in a very well managed process.  We did end up sitting at the bar a bit surprisingly though, would've guessed the wait would've yielded a table.  The atmosphere was super lively."}
{"text":"Barque has the best BBQ experience in Toronto hands down. Chef David Neinstein makes the best dry rub chicken wings and baby back ribs in town. Their family feast dinners for $39 are well worth the trek to the Ronsy area. Their poutine, brisket, pulled pork, Brussels spouts and pretty much everything on the menu is worth trying. From the bucket of fresh bbq popcorn to the great selection of wines and beers, Barque is a great place to bring friends, family and large groups. Their service is always great! You do need a reservation as walk ins are hard to come by in this busy restaurant. If you can't get a table, try their younger sibling down the street called Bar Butcher Bar. They have a similar menu.   I've had the pleasure of working with David and sous-chef Ronny as part of a video series we did for Canadian Tire and his passion for quality food is one of a kind. Keep it going David!"}
{"text":"We had been to Barque in the summer and were absolutely delighted with the service and the food, and were excited to come back when we were next in the area. The next time we were in the area was Tuesday, December 1, and we were all less than impressed this time around. The food seemed to be over-seasoned; my husband had chicken tenders and fries, and I had fried chicken thighs and brisket. The chicken, his and mine both, was just seasoned too much with what tasted like the same stuff that the fries were covered in. Our tongues were literally numb halfway through, and he couldn't finish his chicken. We just weren't thrilled with our meal or the service this time. I hope it was an off day. We may try again next time we're in the area, but probably we'll give it some time before we go back."}
{"text":"had to come out of retirement to talk about the meal i had today.  i ordered the dry rub wings and pulled pork poutine. DONT judge me on eating two animals! hmmph!  I've ordered so many times, and I gotta say, the Wings fluctuate; sometimes crispy sometimes jiggly but the fries never fail me!!! OMG THOSE FRIES. So crucial.  If everything weren't so expensive I'd order way more often! Oh, the ribs are surprisingly meh the one time I had em.  I LOVE the pulled pork poutine."}
{"text":"5 star alarm!!!!!   If your reading this, and I hope you are, rarely do I ever compose a review immediately after I eat.  I usually wait a week and procrastinate.... FYI people - I am a full time business traveler.  BBQ is a staple of my big fat expense spending, yes I am on an expense account.  I get to go where ever I want, eat whatever I want.  I seek out the best of the best....... It is rare that a restaurant just blows me away.....  KC BBQ, been there done that.  Blah!  Carolina BBQ, been there done that. Blah!  Texas BBQ, yeah whatever.  Over rated!!!Toronto BBQ, wtf?  Really?   The hardcore pitmasters just rolled over in their grave.  Once again, the Yelp community shows me the light, thank you fellow Yelpaholics.  Toronto people, this joint is friggin' awesome.  You do not know how lucky you are.   The dry rub wings are perfect.   The dry rub allows for a crispy skin that snaps off.   The smoked meat is NOT your typical pink smoke chicken meat, its on the whiter side with no smoke aftertaste you find in some joints.  The wings are served in a cast iron skillet, I was literally dipping and scraping for the dry rub that fell to the bottom of the skillet.  We ordered the Dry Rub (herb-crusted crunch), Sweet Heat (sticky, sweet, with a little bite) and Barque Rack O' Bama (the classic: rubbed, smoked, basted, basted) Rib Taster.  The Rib Taster is 1/3 rack of each flavor.   The winner goes to Barque Rack O'Bama!!!!  I had to laugh at the name, fitting for Canada, they do love the left.......   The Sweat Heat is great too.  Note ---- the Dry Rub is different than the wing dry rub, it is more of a Jerk.  Just sayn'.   All the baby back ribs are meat fall of the bone good.  We also ordered the Beef Brisket and the Pommery Pull Pork.  The brisket was okay, but I am very critical of brisket and only like it a certain way, it would have rated a 7 out of 10.  Decent, but not to die for.   The Pommery Pulled Pork was excellent, some of the best I have ever had.  Sides - Cajun Mac n' Cheese.  The white cheddar is great and the Cajun panko is a nice touch, but I did not taste any Cajun.  Still really good, but like my brisket, I tend to be overly critical of macncheese.   Now the fries --------- YELP TIP ----------  ask your sever to put the same dry rub on the fries as on the wings.  Awesomeness!!!!!  You will thank me later.  So I did not post any pictures, but the pictures on here are pretty accurate.  The inside is cramped and loud, but get over it and dig into some killer BBQ."}
{"text":"I'd give Barque 5 stars except service was sloooooow (at least during our Saturday brunch), which is sort of puzzling since by its nature, smoked food would have to be largely made ahead of time. Though each dish has made to order side dishes, the smoked centrepiece should already be ready to go. Service was friendly, and the wait for our table was only 10 minutes, but boy oh boy did it take a while for our food to arrive.  Though my own pulled pork breakfast burrito was surprisingly on the bland side, my wife's brisket sandwich was simply divine. I may have to convert to a full-time brisketarian after that sandwich. The side dishes were nice, the atmosphere nice and on the rustic side, and the smell of woodsmoke permeating the air (and the neighbourhood, it would seem) just can't be beat.  Here's hoping we're on an upward trend for authentic BBQ restaurants in TO."}
{"text":"Nice place, liked the atmosphere.  Foods decent.  Fries are way too salty. Service is a  slow."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch. One of the few places you can make a brunch reservation.   Their pulled pork is delicious!"}
{"text":"Been there twice. Busy both times but we got a table. Last week we ate at their store 2 doors south, The Butcher Shop.   My kids were happy. I was happy. Service great. Food very good"}
{"text":"I went here again on a sunday evening for dinner.  They had a $25 set menu, which was quite reasonable and had an interesting thing or two on it, such as some fried sweet-potato balls, and also lentils with a hint of pork.  While the food was a bit more impressive than my lunch experience, overall, it did not justify a four-star rating."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Their customer service, cozy feel and delicious food keep me coming back. I came to Barque on my birthday and the server made sure that our party was treated like royalty. I always make a reservation since they are booked up way in advance."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal at Barque... Great little popcorn to start and all the food was flavourful and perfectly cooked.  Small place and difficult to get a seat but well worth it!  I would say more but the current review score speaks for itself"}
{"text":"Lived up to all the hype.  The staff, the food, the experience was terrific.    I would definitely say Barque is better than any BBQ in Nashville, Tenn.  The combo platter was enormous.  The Ribs were juicy, fall off the bone.  Pulled pork was moist, brisket had a balanced smokey taste, and the chicken wings had a great seasoning that I may have to replicate at home.    The two small bottles of sauce were okay.  The wing sauce was incredible.  Loved it.  Was better than my own homemade sauce.   I'll have to work on mine some more.    Worth the wait to visit."}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Dinner Specialty: Barbecue Menu items: Meats = Brisket, Baby Back Ribs, Chicken Thigh | Sides = Caesar Salad & Spinach Spaetzle  Barbecue has made its way into Rocensvalles, an area known as the centre of the Polish community in Toronto. Competing against local favourites like Cafe Polonez, Barque Smokehouse has been smoking the streets of this neighborhood with a sampling menu and a killer atmosphere.  Though one can order a la carte, Barque offers guests sampler options that let's one choose from a list of meats and sides, depending on the party size. Because I had my eye set on specific items that I just had to try, I went with the sampler for one.  The dish came with slices of beef brisket that were tender and juicy, and just sucked the smoke right out of the smoker. It was as though all the flavour had concentrated on this one meat. I still salivate just thinking about it.  I also ordered the chicken thigh due to popular demand and was remarkably impressed with the almost fall-of-the-bone texture of the meat; though I would have liked the skin to be more juicy and crispy, as that's my favourite part of eating chicken with the skin on.  The famous baby back ribs were cooked to near perfection with a bit of pink on the center and crunchy almost brunt outer shell. The ribs came with a dry rub that was slightly overpowering for my taste. One can also order them spicy, which will make the meat less dry; however since I can't handle spice that well, I would have liked a mild sauce option as I found I am not the dry-rub kinda gal.  Believe it or not, the highlight of the night for me were the sides. The Caesar salad was probably one of the freshest and tastiest I've had at a restaurant. The lettuce leafs were bright green covered in a house-made dressing with a sweet and tangy flavour. Topped with candied smoked bacon and a nutty-flavoured Parmesan cheese, Barque definitely smokes all other contenders out.  The other side that impressed my taste buds was the Spinach Spaetzle. This was basically a soft spinach egg noodle with a light creamy sauce, sauteed mushrooms, tomatoes and Parmasean crisps for texture. The pasta was gooey and flavourful, yet the lightness of the sauce balanced it well to preserve the premise of this dish being a side, to compliment the strong taste of the meats.   With a 500-pound-capacity smoker imported from Tennessee and an atmosphere \"a la Terroni\", Barque is a spot one must visit, especially on cold winter days when Barbecue season seems so far away.  Buen Provecho, Viviana."}
{"text":"While in Toronto we stumbled across this place. Good food and great people. We had to wait a bit to get in but the staff took care of us from the time we arrived until the time we left. The patio seemed to be the place to sit. Ribs are rubbed and quite tasty and the brisket was so tender you could cut it with a fork. The only thing missing from the menu was Mac and cheese. The beer selection was a little disappointing. They had two craft beers on tap from a local brewery, an IPA and Pale Ale. They were out of the IPA, our favorite, so we had to settle for the Pale Ale. It was a sweeter beer not very hoppy but went down smooth. Being from Michigan we are used to seeing a long list of craft beer on tap. However, the ambiance more than made up for lack of beer selection. The place was down to earth filled with spirited yet laid back patrons and very friendly staff.  We ended up meeting two locals who sat next to us and had great conversation about everything. They ended being our guides that evening to some great local bars!"}
{"text":"Ate here with my partner on a sunday evening and it was the family dinner night which is totally worth the money for the amount of meats and sides. 35 dollars (per person) for ribs,  chicken, beef brisket, chicken wings, salads, mash sweet potatoes, and dessert. Mind you, go in with an empty stomach and an appetite. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ, We had the variety which came with 3 different meats and 2 sides. We also had the duck tacos. We loved everything. We preferred the potato side order over the pasta. The ribs were our favorite thing we tried here. Also everything together filled us up.  This place gets pretty busy so make reservations in advance."}
{"text":"I had ribs for lunch here, the order promptly served. Tasty but hardly falling off the bone, with a spicy sauce. Fries were plentiful but soggy. I was slightly disappointed overall, and Barque didn't live up to its previous reputation."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time here at Barque. Lucy looked after us. She was very sweet and helpful, never seemed rushed.  Everything we tried was excellent. Wings as appetizers with dry rub was very tasty, and then we shared sampler for two with brisket, chicken thigh and baby back ribs, all good and plenty of food.  Go with the Cuban corn as a side dish.  We decided to throw caution to the wind and ordered the home-made pecan pie. It was to die for with my cup of of coffee.   You may have to wait a week or two for a reservation, but it's worth it.  They have a nice patio, wasn't open, but in the summer, this place will be easier to get into with the additional seats, and a lovely venue.  Also very good value for the money."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service and friendly company.   Had the beef brisket and it was perfect. The server accidentally messed up our order and so he ended up getting more meat than we ordered - no complaints with that.   They also offer this popcorn with a tasty powder on it - a nice compliment with a beer and a great snack while you wait.   Beer selection there was great and the server was very knowledgable about them.   Then place itself is a little crowded, but that's also because of the area - hard to find a restaurant bigger than that. Plus, I'm sure it just felt crowded because of how busy it was - waited about 20 minutes for a table for 4 on a Thursday night.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had such an awesome lunch! Came in and it was clean and just pleasant inside. Staff were very friendly. They give you the option of complimentary regular water or sparkling water. Which is a nice option. And give you some popcorn seasoned with some spices, super good. Smokey and sweet.  My friend an I started with the soup of the day. It was broccoli soup topped with whipped goat cheese. It was amazing. Probably the best broccoli soup I've ever had.  We both decided to get the sampler for lunch. This lets you pick 2 meats and 1 side. I chose the 12 hour beef brisket and baby back ribs with the sweet sauce. So good! The brisket was tender and yum! Ribs were fall off the bone and the sauce had enough sweetness, enough smokey flavour and just the right kick.  My friend got the ribs as well, and pulled pork. The pulled pork was good, but could have been a little sweeter.  For the side I got the Caesar salad. It's topped with in house made croutons and candied bacon. Amazing!   Overall awesome experience and would recommend this place to everyone! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. One of the best brunch spots in the city. Service is great and the drinks are fantastic. Always order the Caesar, the bacon rim is a game changer   Dinner, ribs are a must. Don't get anything else, you'll have run envy if you do.   Five out of five experience!"}
{"text":"Place is awesome. Not much more to add. Food rocked across the board.  I guess I could nitpick to explain the 4 star instead of 5 star - sausage was amazing but it's one of those things so rich you cannot each half of one, never mind a whole one. The table shared it though so it was fine but they should really serve it that way.  The ribs were great but weren't \"fall off the bone\". I would almost prefer that to some fall off the bone I've had that didn't taste this good, but the texture I guess was better.  Everything else was amazing. The fact we walked away from a BBQ place talking about the sides which were mainly vegetables speaks volumes. The corn, the fries, omg. So good.  I think that's because we are fans of BBQ but not super hardcore, so that much meat and sauce tends to get really rich by the end of the meal, so what starts as a flavor explosion ends up with a \"ooook I'm done with that\", which is natural and in no way a hit on this place.  Whereas the veggies were great beginning to end. Also you didn't get a huge stack of them like you do meat so they stand out a bit when your belly hurts at the end.  Anyway. I digress. A must-visit in Toronto. Just be prepared to WAIT if you don't get reservations.  Oh and patio chairs have an additional cushion on them that made them incredibly comfortable. Some of the most comfortable ever.  But the bees on the patio. Ugh. So bad they have fly swatters out at tables. What can ya do?"}
{"text":"Nice looking interior, has a section with bar stools & another with proper sit down areas.   Ordered three appetizers, Brisket Poutine, Smoked Wings & Pulled Duck Tacos.   The Brisket Poutine was very good as the brisket & cheese sauce made simple cut potatoes very interesting to the palette.    Spicy Chipotle Smoked Wings were tender & quite spicy.  Lastly, the Pulled Duck Tacos, which were unremarkable.   The main, was the Sampler for Two which consisted of two Competition Chicken Thighs, 1/2 Rack of Baby Back Ribs & Brisket.   Of the three, I enjoyed the Brisket the most as it was infused with the most flavor throughout & required no additional sauces on the outside as all flavor came from within.  It is worth mentioning that the process of making the Brisket is done by first smoking the meat unwrapped for 6 hours, then smoking for another 6 hours wrapped in aluminum foil.  Overall the service was attentive & friendly, so I enjoyed my visit to this restaurant & could see myself coming back here again at some point."}
{"text":"Family night is the best value here. Amazing one time menus put together just for one night. Not good if you aren't a carnivore but if you are this place will hit the spot!     Always a good idea to make reservations on the weekend as the place is very small! And did I mention the free spicy kettle Popcorn on every table? Mmmmmmmm."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I attended this new Roncesvalles BBQ joint and were enraptured by the rustic decor.  The 30-something owners have done a really fantastic job of created an old aged and wooden feel- they now have a patio and a frontal window which opens to the street to create that outdoor feel while inside.  The owners both introduced themselves and both seemed like great guys.  We shared the bbq sampler and were certainly impressed and left with a take-out container!  Their house bbq sauce is also quite unique.  A great addition to the Roncy neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Bland, mediocre food. We went for the Sunday family meal and I wouldn't go back. Whatever you do, avoid the lamb stew - hardly any meat and tasted like a reheated frozen dinner."}
{"text":"Dinner service for Sunday Family Dinner starts at 5p so if you walk by there just before 5p, there would be plenty of people out front. That's because the doors have not opened yet.  Waitress says 5p is the busiest time to eat there, so that probably means later you arrive, likelier you get a seat.  Sunday family dinner is a lot of food. The cocktail drinks are great. The waitress, so nice, helpful and unpretentious. Reading the article in the bathroom about how it came about was cool too."}
{"text":"Ate with a group of six and the entire group felt it was only 'okay'.  The meats were either dry or, in our opinion- maybe not yours, too smoky-tasting.  Simply done chicken was the best of the meats, and my asparagus seemed to be the best thing on anyone's plate.  And that's not saying much.   As usual, beware the hype!"}
{"text":"I'd love to give this place 2.5 stars, but as I can't do that, two it is.   First off, the service. Friendly, but slow, slow, slow. Drinks took forever to arrive, the food even longer. A plate of olives and some hummus, the starter, should not take close to 1/2 an hour to make an appearance.   As a mains, we shared the sampler platter. The kitchen got our order wrong, sending out gnocchi instead of fries, chicken instead of beef. No matter, at this time we were so hungry, we just wanted to eat.  1. The brisket. Awesome texture, but no flavour of any kind. Utterly bland, only somewhat rescued by the BBQ sauce (awesome) that was on the table.   2. Brussels sprout salad. I swear that salad had been wilting in the kitchen for a bunch of hours. It looked and tasted...old. Tired and dull.   3. The ribs. Now I understand that not all ribs fall off the the bone. But there's a difference between tightness and dryness and the ribs we were being served were dry. Either the kitchen had been rushed or the temperature was wrong.   4. The gnocchi arrived cold, in a congealing cheese sauce/dressing. Seriously? Seriously.    So here we were, disappointed in a restaurant that was obviously buzzing all around us. It did occur to us  that we might just be either really. Really picky or just plain wrong in our opinion.   But I don't think we were. It just wasn't all that good."}
{"text":"I've walked past Barque so many times and always wanted to try it, so we came here for my birthday dinner. What an amazing place! The waitresses are super friendly and very prompt. We started with an appetizer of wings and then we all had ribs. Absolutely amazing! 1/2 rack was so much meat I couldn't finish it. Seasoning was perfect!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Awesome meats! great in-house sausages! yummy kale and fries. Good stuff and nice service!"}
{"text":"Our first time at this place and it was a Sunday night-family night where they offer a set menu as well as the regular menu. We went for the set menu to share @ $30/ person; Appetizers, main course  & dessert. Everything was excellent and the staff was very attentive. The patio was very comfortable and fully equip for all kinds of weather. We will go back"}
{"text":"This enduring and popular resto may be a refined barbecue house, but it feels more like the neighbourhood's dining room. The great staff, relaxing unpretentious atmosphere (they put on children's movies when it seem nothing else to be on on TV), and food food food. People and whole families of all sorts are to be found here, why not you too?  I recall enjoying their sweet sexy ribs and pulled pork, but they also have a small brunch menu that's mostly loaded with their signature meats. Just do the smoked duck pancakes ($16), it's crazy funny good with the pulled meat mixed in with the blueberry compote that covers half the fluffy pancakes. (It was even on the cover of a 2016 NOW Magazine issue covering best brunch places.)  [TTC: take 504 to Grenadier Ave]"}
{"text":"Heard so many good things about this place but when I finally got around to trying it I was so disappointed. The BBQ ribs we ordered were way over sauced but the meat still tasted dry (i.e. void of its natural juices). I also wasn't a fab of their sauce either (a bit too tart for my liking)."}
{"text":"Every time we try a new restaurant and flip over how amazing it is, I'm shocked. My husband is effectively mute when it comes to emoting and he was right there with me when I started freaking out on the arrival of each dish. All we could get out was, \"Oh my god. What... I can't even believe this right now.\"  Having been warned that this place is consistently lined up out the door, we arrived just in time for the seniors' rush (seriously, the place was packed with bubbies, each one more delighted with her totally non-Kosher meal than the next).   Even at 5PM, Barques was rammed. Recently, though, my husband and I decided that we are officially OK with bar seats. This discovery has opened up a new universe of line-jumping. We were escorted to the bar and welcomed with a bucket of popcorn, popcorn dip and Q water. (Absolutely agree with Yelper Mel L. that the popcorn is laced with something fiercely addictive.)  On the recommendation of our bartender, we ordered the Barque Plate: smoked hummus and pita; olive and nuts; pulled pork nachos (yes!); and duck/pork sausage. Aaaand ribs. The whole enterprise came with our selection of sides: fries and grilled asparagus.   As Scooby Doo played on the flat screen above the bar, we took down every last bite like it was our job. The meat was a smokey slam dunk and I was surprisingly drawn to the asparagus and pita in particular.   In spite of a packed house, the staff was calm and cool -- just what you'd expect of a Roncy round-up. Plus, when I went to peek into the kitchen, the entire team looked delighted...and then proceeded to introduce themselves!"}
{"text":"Had brunch at Barque for the first time today. Tried the Barque Benedict (brisket, poached eggs, bbq hollandaise on cornbread, with hash and salad) and was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't a heavy meal (it could've used more brisket to balance out with the eggs) and the cornbread was the perfect bed of carbs for all that protein."}
{"text":"A plateful of delicious meat?  Who can say no to that?  Went here for a birthday lunch for a friend.  It's a small but cozy place with lovely servers.    I had the lunch sampler which lets you choose 2 meats and a side.  I had the fried chicken and the beef brisket.  The chicken was great - crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside.  The beef brisket was nice but had lots of fat on it which was the one thing i disliked.  I had the smoked asparagus which had a nice smokey flavour which was quite nice.    Along with the meat they bring you 2 sauces so you can further add flavour to your meat.  You even get your own meat brush!   Lunch for 2, with drinks, tea, dessert came up to $60 incl tax.  Not bad for a great afternoon"}
{"text":"wait and lines are major turn off, try it during 'off' peak hours.  Food is great, good quality, very expensive for what you get, people are willing to pay it, so I get it...  Suggest take out during quiet periods (not lunch dinner!!!)"}
{"text":"not a good place to visit on a warm day since most of the seating is around the grill and it gets really hot."}
{"text":"Its not bad.  The food is generally good.  But why do you have to put rosemary in your marinades/rubs.  Rosemary is the worst herb you can use.  Its like perfume.  You don't want to taste the herbs, you want to taste the meat.  If you like strong herbs then just go to the mall, buy your favorite  Au du Toilette, and spray it on your meat.  To me strong herbs are to mask foods that don't taste good.  Just like perfume is for bodies that don't smell good. Also the service here sucked.  The guy that served us obviously was angry and needed to relieve himself.  Stroke it before you work, it helps."}
{"text":"we went there on canada day with my partner, i knew it was gonna be busy so i made the reservation on line first before we head out which i highly recommend.  The first impression I got this is a cozy little place, the host are friendly, they acknowledge you right the way which is very important to me. Sometimes when you walk in to a restaurant, if there is no one to acknowledge you don't you feel a bit left out or unwelcome. Overall the staff are friendly and attentive.  First we ordered a couple drinks, the bloody cesar, and my partner got the cucumber drink, i have to say the cucumber one is very refreshing I never had a drink like that before, it was good on a hot summer day.  We ordered the smoke duck taco, i have to say is one of the better one i had, i try the one at Origin before I found Origin is very overpriced and it was not that great a bit on a salty side.  We also ordered the chicken wings, they were big and juicy, we were very please with both starters.  Then we ordered the sampler for 2 and they come with 3 sides of your choice.  The brisket was good, the ribs are excellent, is not the kind fell off the bone, but i have to say their ribs are one the best in town, the chicken thighs are also smoky and juicy. The creamy cauliflower was also one of my favorite side dish.  We knew we ordered way more than enough for 2 people but is worth, Of course there were leftover to take home.  I also would like to say that their homemade hot sauce was so good but unfortunately they don't sell them, I did bought a bottle of the mustard base bbq sauce it would be good when i make chicken or ribs at home.     Overall, we were very pleased with the experience and the food and service, for sure we will be back again."}
{"text":"Came here with friends on Saturday aft, they were serving brunch.  Busy place, 40 min wait for tables, so we sat at bar. Menu was brunch-modified BBQ items but a special was also available, baby half rack of ribs with side.  We all had this, I also had cheddar biscuit and pint of St Ambroise pale.  Food was good, came with BBQ and honey mustard sauce on side for dipping.  Service was a little slow, and I had to remind the server about my biscuit , but overall ok.  I would def come here again. Obviously a popular place in Roncesvalles village."}
{"text":"One of the best smokehouse places ever. Bit pricy, but worth it. The meats are all moist and very flavourful. The sauces are amazing. Get the rib sampler and the lamb rids. Also make sure u get the corn. The staff are very friendly and good at making you feel at home."}
{"text":"I've been keeping a meaty eye on Barque for some time now. I had been thwarted by late nights and torrential downpours, but a beautiful Sunday afternoon invited me, three of my fellow yelpers and our appetites.  The result? This is the best place for BBQ in Toronto. It feels homemade but tastes better. The room is well decorated and feels cozy and comfortable even if you score the rear seats by their smoker. Although if you do, don't be dismayed, these are the best seats in the house for food-minded folks. You not only get to watch the prep for tomorrow's servings, but the staff is more than happy to chat with you, and even share some techniques or recipes. It's a great family joint or for groups of 4-8, although you may want to try calling in advance if you are 4 or more, as this place is righteously popular.  My fellow yelper, Tara E, has done a respectable rundown of what you can expect to eat and the general cost, so I won't bother with duplicating those details, but I will add that since my visit I have sent several friends to Barque and received reviews so glowing, they might be radioactive."}
{"text":"Such a gem. Came here today for a brunch date as it was nearby high park and (for once) there was good weather in Toronto.  Crab Salad (17): O. M. G. There was minced crab underneath the two deep fried poached eggs, topped did with avocado dream sauce, and a magical tomato hollandaise. One of the best brunch dishes I've ever tasted, and even plated so nicely! The healthy salad green part was separated so you can mix in whatever you want.     Pork and Beans 3 Ways with Quail Eggs (16): More like a little tasting platter. It was too good though, this tasting platter is a tease. Each one had its own unique flavour and each were amazing.   These are only two dishes out o all their brunch menu. They still have dinner and I intend to give it a try as well. Have a couple of drinks while I'm at it (might be a bit more biased on my dinner review after those...).   Service was great, they have complimentary sparkling water and are super attentive. Lovely people.   Atmosphere and decorations are totally on point, the patio was perfect on a sunny day like today!"}
{"text":"We had a great family dinner tonight at Barque. The food was amazing and the service was fabulous. We opted for the \"Family Night\" special, delivering 3 courses of mouth-watering food, served family style.  The salad and wings to start were delicious, followed by their smokehouse trio of ribs, brisket and pulled pork (all yummy), with fries, finishing with desert for everyone!  What a meal - enough for a leftovers to take home."}
{"text":"Barque's has become an institution in the Toronto BBQ scene. I first visit this place about 2 years ago and I have been back several times since then. Whether it be dinner, lunch, brunch they never fail to impress. I did find their brisket a little dry for my liking though but the ribs and other meats are quite smokey and flavourful. I wouldn't say they are particular strong in any one thing but they do everything consistently well.  There has been a slew of new barbecue joints that have opened in this great city in the recent years but Barque's still remains one of my favourites.  I do caution that you should make a reservation before your visit. This place is quite tight and they do fill up fast. The seats aren't exactly the most comfortable as well. You will be rubbing elbows with your neighbours."}
{"text":"Great little BBQ place in Roncesvalles Village.   The restaurant itself is rather nice and the bar is awesome. They've got some TV's to watch the game and some nice high tops to go along with the scattered tables around the restaurant with the kitchen in the back.  Had a number of items there and they were all pretty damn good. The Smoked Wings were amazing. The wings were large and though it wasn't the crispiest, the meat was so juicy that it was irrelevant. The BBQ Chicken was great as well. I'm not typically a fan of smoked poultry, but they had a real nice juiciness to it. The beef brisket was also real good as it was just cut, so you still had all that juicy liquid fat coating the meat. For sides, the mashed potatoes were good while the brussel sprouts were a bit too salty, but doesn't detract from the overall meal.  It's pretty hard to find good BBQ in the GTA so it's nice to find some going down Toronto. The place itself is located off the beaten path of the downtown core, but was well worth a trip. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"It was about 9PM on a wednesday night and I decided to give Barque Smokehouse a go without a reservation (I was kinda rolling the dice here).  After putting our name down and hoping for a bar seat we were surprised with a table (Score!).  We promptly sat down and looked at the menu whilst snacking on their popcorn appetizer.  I'm not quite sure if it's always the same, but I feel they put a lot of earthy spices in it so I would almost call it jerk popcorn.  We ordered the pulled duck tacos, and a sampler for one for two people.  In the sampler we had a choice of 3 kinds of meat so we chose the dry ribs, brisket and the chicken.  Note that it also comes with 2 sides (the 2 person sampler comes with 3) so keep this in mind when you're ordering or else you may pass out due to meat ingestion.  The duck tacos weren't amazing.  The duck was a little hard for my liking (it wasn't really fall apart tender).  I'd probably not order this again next time.  The brisket was the next thing I had.  OMG i literally could have eaten this whole thing with a spoon.  The brisket is super tender and was full of smoke flavour.  This may be the best brisket I've ever had.    The chicken was also mind blowing.  The combination of the tenderness of the chicken and how well the smoke flavour penetrated was unbelievable.  I'd probably just order the chicken next time, definitely a superb choice.  The ribs were a good too, but maybe I shouldn't have saved it for last.  I found the dry rub a little salty at times but found that the meat from the ribs just fell off easily.  The ribs were super tender but I think the sauced version of them would have been better.    In terms of the sides, they're quite sizeable as well.  We got the pasta and the caesar salad.  The pasta was amazing as it was made with fresh squid ink pasta (probably made that day) with a garlic cream sauce.  I was actually impressed with the caesar as well.  The biggest thing I noticed was the fact that they used good parmesan.  You can really taste good parmesan so I was really happy.  It also doesn't hurt to put some nice pieces of bacon in your salad as well...  It wouldn't be a proper salad without some meat in it... common...  This is definitely a place that you have to visit again just to try everything.  There's plenty to eat and well... plenty to eat.  Be sure to give some of the other things a taste or steal off your friends plates that you don't like."}
{"text":"Barbecue is a tough restaurant cuisine to take on.  Everyone has those excellent memories of the great ribs we had that time, or the incredible jerk fish at that tiny place on holiday the other year, or just the smoked brisket that your one uncle always makes and really can't be beaten.  The food at Barque doesn't quite make it there, but some of the dishes are really knocking at the door.  We arrived as a party of four for the excellent value family night meal which kicked off very promisingly with yellow pepper gazpacho, bacon fried radishes, and - best - a salt cod and lemon jam crispbread.  Bold flavours all worked well together.  Mains were good, but not all quite great. Ribs could have been cooked longer to be softer and the merguez and clams were nice but not combined as well as they might have been.  Chicken with fennel was delicious though - well prepared and a great flavour combination - definitely my highlight.  Dessert was pleasantly light - a light, spongy chocolate brownie - not too cloying, excellent when washed down with the last of my excellent oatmeal stout.  Overall I think that our food was good, if not great, but the pleasant service, fine beer selection and low price made up for it - would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Brunch staff seem expressionless.  Bored Zombies serving Brunch.  No one smiles.  They make the necessary small talk but body language speaks volumes in the service industry.     Their rendition of Eggs Benny is a fail. The eggs on both orders were over poached.  And the 10 dollar Ceaser ?  Take away the ice and you have a little more than a small cup of drink.    I won't be back.  Ace (a few blocks south) was much more enjoyable !"}
{"text":"I'm sure it's all already been said, but I finally had the chance to eat here and I just loved everything about it!  Tara Z and I shared the meat combo for 2 people, we tried the brisket, beef ribs and baby back ribs. The baby back ribs were the star of the show, but the other two were both good. A single beef rib was nearly the size of my head, I felt like Fred Flintstone gnawing down on that thing.   For sides we had the pickled vegetables, the arugula salad and the kale.   I thought the popcorn on the table was a very nice touch and it was quite delicious.  Waitstaff is quite hipster, friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.   I thought the price ($42 split between two people for the platter) was exceptionally reasonable.   I will be back to eat more delicious meat."}
{"text":"I've been to barque a few times over the past year. At this point I know what the expect. Incredible service with mouthwatering dishes. A few times that I've gone there was a bit of a wait but the staff were very informative and set good expectations for wait times, even when I've showed up with a larger group of people. Love this place."}
{"text":"I brought a large group to Barque for dinner, and everyone had an incredible time. We reserved a few weeks in advance for a table for 12. The restaurant offered us a fixed price menu at $25 per person to make it easy on the kitchen - it's not a big place. They promised a great variety of BBQ faves, and let me tell you, they did not disappoint! The food just kept coming - gazpacho, flatbreads, chicken wings, pork ribs, beef ribs, salads, smoked chicken.... it was an amazing spread! And every dish was better than the last! We also had a very competent server, and the chef came out to check on us more than once, on a busy Th nonetheless. We can't wait to go again. Soooo goood!"}
{"text":"If you like comfort food and bbq, you will love Barque! We came here for weekend brunch. You know a place is good when the food arrives and conversation stops because everyone is too focused on the food. I ordered the chicken and waffles, and let me tell you- those waffles are to die for. It's like eating a delicious deep fried donut! The spice and sauce used on the chicken was amazing. The chicken was moist, tender and full of flavour. My friend ordered the duck pancakes and they were also delicious. We are still talking about Barque a week later and  will for sure return to try the dinner menu. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I came to Barque on a Saturday afternoon around 1pm for brunch with a party of 6 (4 adults 2 kids) and were quickly seated. The brunch menu is solid, with classic options like eggs and bacon and more adventurous fare like smoked duck pancakes -- all with that Barque flair (think pulled pork, candied bacon, and tender brisket).  3 of us got the Barque Benedict ($16), each with a different choice of meat (brisket, pulled pork, citrus smoked salmon). It comes on cornbread with spiced home fries, with a tasty arugula salad. The scrambled eggs ($16) came with pulled pork and candied bacon (their bacon is TO DIE FOR). Everything we got was delicious. Their coffee is bottomless and served in adorable random mugs that will remind you of being at a cottage. You get a choice of sparkling or flat water (ooh fancy). Good portion sizes - we were all full afterwards.  Our party had allergies to gluten and nuts plus a picky child and Barque went above and beyond in accommodating us. Our server was one of the best servers I've had in a long time, completely on top of things, friendly, and patient. It's also worth mentioning they have a gluten free fryer for you gluten-free people that love fries!  The decor inside is BBQ joint-esque. They have an awesome selection of wines and St. Ambroise beer for those that want to imbibe. This place also gets bonus points for having nice, clean individual bathrooms as well as a larger bathroom for families.    All around a 5 star experience - I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for Brunch and really enjoyed it! Had the lemon pepper dry ribs (I'm not usually a fan of dry ribs but I loved it) and the chicken and waffles were delicious too.   I was also surprised they take reservations! We had 7 people on the holiday Monday after Canada Day. Wasn't a problem at all. Can't wait to try the dinner menu someday."}
{"text":"Big fan of this place. They do bbq right. I had the sampler platter with the baby back ribs and the beef ribs. Everything was delicious, portions were great and the sides that accompanied the dish were great too. Wait staff was friendly and the overall experience was fantastic."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!  Tonight again I thought if try again and called at 9:45 and got cut off..  Called again and after being on hold till 9:59 they say no more even knowing I had called 15 minutes earlier!  Not coming here again...   Too over rated!  Sorry but Toronto is FULL of good food and service just sucks!"}
{"text":"Barque serves up good BBQ somewhat reminiscent of BBQ in the southern United States. However, southern BBQ pork is a bit more moist, the sauce not always as sweet, and the BBQ culture more everyday and less upscale than this. You would not find yourself spending 60$ for two people to eat BBQ in Memphis, Kansas City, or Birmingham, AL. Southern BBQ is an art form that does not sell at gallery prices.  Here are the pros and cons...  1. The BBQ is good and a genuine attempt at getting it right, but not fantastic. You can spend over 25$ on platters that do not leave you full. 2. The place is really a neat space with a small bar and a variety of seating options (tables, booths, high tables, bar).  3. The wine prices a reasonable, and beer is on par with most places. The cocktails are overpriced and under-poured. 4. The service is poor. The place has a couple of good servers, but do not be surprised if you are basically ignored at the bar or a table.  I do not know if this is from lack of training or simply that they have lots of business anyway. Either way, don't expect too much. 5. Brunch is good, but overpriced. It is a little more exciting than a greasy spoon breakfast, but much more expensive. For a better brunch at a slightly better price, try The Ace down the street.   Barque could be a much better place, but right now, that doesn't seem to matter."}
{"text":"Love this place. I ordered the Sampler for one: Selected 3 meats, competition chicken thigh, baby back ribs (dry rub) and beef brisket. 2 sides, Brussels sprouts with squash and sesame cream sauce and fries.   Everything was delicious, even the Brussels sprouts which I have always detested. Also , if you don't want alcohol, they have a great homemade lemonade as well:)   If you didn't make reservations, try to arrive around 6:30pm or 7pm on weekends. We waited about 30 mins around that time. Just headed down the block to the new Ed's Real Scoop and had dessert before our meal."}
{"text":"Great for meat lovers. We shared a few family style platters with lots of napkins. Stand out potatoes and ribs."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, the rib was dry, chicken wing is tender but just tossed with sauce, nothing special, and portion is small."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night at 9:00.  We ordered the platter for four, but a few minutes after, they told us that the sausages were finished and that they will add a different kind of meat to our platter, that was a bit disappointing. It took a while to get our drinks on the table, in fact the food arrived first.  The waitress was not very friendly it felt as if didn't have one.  The food was great, every kind o meat tasted really nice."}
{"text":"True slow smoked BBQ with all kinds of delicious twists. The brisket is \"better than Bubby's\" and goes surprisingly well in an Egg's Benedict brunch. The savoury pancakes with smoked duck, chevre and blueberry compote had everyone at our table moaning and pulling their hair with joy. The Ceasars with candied bacon rim made time slow and float by with a smile. I can't wait to come back and have dinner here in a few weeks. Worth noting, we were urged to make our reservations now for our next trip since they are already booking almost a full month ahead! Great news for a great new place on Roncesvalles."}
{"text":"I can see why it's busy. It has a good atmosphere.   Went last Thursday night. Left my name and got a call 15 minutes later for 2 seats at the bar table at the back. Otherwise, I was told a table would take 45-60mins.  We love the bucket of popcorn.   Had a fine but also forgettable cauliflower soup to start.  My friend and I shared the platter for two. My fav was the chicken thigh, but then again, we didn't et a chance to try the ribs. We had the dry rub babyback ribs, which was meh - average. Smoked meat we had anticipated for a more tender version. Side roasted vegetables and asparagus were fine.   Pecan pie was average, their banana creme brulee was better.   Probably will go back to try brunch, that's about it.   Yes, service can be slow like most reviewers had mentioned."}
{"text":"We've been here over 3 times already, and the service is always great. The go to place for ribs, beef brisket, sausages and fries!"}
{"text":"Droooooooool..... a new favourite of mine in the city.  I knew good things were about to happen when I saw everyone`s place setting includes a bbq sauce brush. The food here is incredible!   The brisket is melt in your mouth, the ribs tender and juicy, the house-made squash gnocchi is creamy and could make a meal of it`s own if you wanted it to.  I was a little surprised not to see pull pork as a regular on the menu but I hear it does make an appearance on the specials. I would love Guy Fieri from Triple D to check this place out."}
{"text":"Happened to be in the neighbourhood yesterday and having heard a lot of positives about Barque I decided to give it a try last night.   Overall impression? Good, but not great.   My order consisted of the BBQ Pork, Chorizo Sausage, and the Cajun Mac and Cheese.  Positives: Staff were friendly, our server was pleasant and the door staff also very nice. Cajun mac and cheese was also quite good - I could have gone with a but more spice kick to it, but I'd order it again.  Cons: Pork although very tender had quite a bit of fat to it, more than what I would normally expect. Good flavour, but prefer a little more lean.   Sausage in contrast was terrific flavour but unfortunately on the dry side. I would order it again and give it a second try.  I would have also liked to have seen a selection of different types of BBQ sauces to accompany the food. Having traveled to different States and had some phenomenal southern BBQ that is one thing they do and it's a nice addition.  Potential is there for sure - I'd go back again but am curious to try a few other BBQ spots in the city first too for comparison."}
{"text":"Third visit last night, we made our reservations the required 2 weeks in advance. Ordered the all in 3 course meal, actually all 5 of us did.  The good: everything smoked was great.  The not so good: cold Brussels sprouts...that's just wrong, this wasn't a salad and it was stone cold. The sweet potato fries were so over salted they were inedible. Way too much cinnamon because of the over salting. I don't eat fries so I didn't complain to the server but we should have.  Verdict: still great smoked stuff but overpriced. We'll go somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic and the sharing platter was definitely the way to go, as it allows you to taste a variety of Barque's specialties.  The chicken is the best thing on the menu accompanied by the spinach Spätzle, outstanding."}
{"text":"This place has an awesome brunch menu!  I need to go back to try all the options - I hadn't been so excited ordering in a long time.  I settled on the smoked brisket Benedict on corn bread.  It sounded great but execution was a little off.  Brisket needed to be more tender and the potatoes were on the greasy side.  The french toast though is really out of this world  I'll be back to give this place a 2nd try: pulled pork scrambled eggs, chorizo skillet and pork bely breakfast tacos are on the list!"}
{"text":"I walked in with a date after looking for good BBQ places in Toronto, thinking it was just like any other run of the mill BBQ place with good food. I asked for a table for 2, they said it'd be an hour wait, even for the bar and gave some pretty bad attitude as if I should know that. Immediately left after that. There was an open table too, and was an open table for 5 minutes even as we were deciding outside where to go next. The decor was fancy and didn't feel welcoming at all for a BBQ place.   BBQ is my favourite food, and when I go out I don't expect to be treated like some lower class citizen who didn't make reservations. It kills me because I'm sure the food is very good, but the attitude and atmosphere is definitely not for me.  Edit: I went back, meat was tasty, sat at the bar. Barkeep was extremely nice and agreed with not liking the reservation idea, got a free drink. Still not keen on it taking reservations, just silly and posh. Upgrading to 3/5 from 1/5."}
{"text":"This place is not bad.  I've been to most BBQ places in Toronto and to be honest, the best of them would be considered average or below average if you were in the States.  Barque is no different.  Had the Meat Platter four Four.  Came with ribs (the best thing on the plate...pretty decent), beef brisket (not much flavour), competition chicken thigh (presentation is nice but not much flavour), lamb shoulder (kinda bland), turkey sausage (interesting texture), pulled pork (OK).  This plate was $99 for four people so it was actually really decent value for the amount of food.  But the flavour was simply lacking.  Service was friendly and pro.  Atmosphere is nice.  Not bad, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I went to Barque yesterday with high expectations. We ordered the brisket, ribs, mac n cheese and the winter slaw. The brisket was good it was juicy but Ive had better brisket. The ribs were dry and tough. We really should have sent them back. The winter slaw was probably the best item we had and the mac n cheese was good but not great. Its in my neighbourhood but I wont be back."}
{"text":"Went on St. Patrick's Day 2016!!!  Beers on tap are $8/pint. -Cheval Blanc -Belle Gueule  Chicken wings, $12,  (sweet-hot) were finger-licking good. Full rack of ribs, $30, were ok. Poutine, $12, were ok too.  Ambiance was lively.  Free popcorn & l'eau pétillante (forgot the word in English)."}
{"text":"Friday night and BBQ is callin' my name!  Could have done the usual St. Louis but naw, not this time.  Again, my co-worker Eli put out his recommendation for BARQUE to try on the famous Roncesvalles Avenue.  Parked on the side of the road, table for 4 and we get in around 8PM.  There was a 3 minute wait for a table to come up which wasn't too shabby at all.  It wasn't too busy either, regardless if Game 6 of Raptors vs Brooklyn Nets was going on.  Let's Go Raptors!  We order the platter for 2, choice of three meats and three non.  Absolutely famished we chose for the meats: beef brisket, chicken thighs and sweet heat ribs and for the non-meats: asparagus, fries and creamy cauliflower.  Meats were good!  Brisket was soft, tasty and juicy.  Definitely a favourite.  Thighs were a tad undercooked but I'm sure this is the way they are cooked, not to be too well done.  Salmonella beware!  The chicken was soft with a little bit of flavour.  The ribs were okay, a little on the dry side and somewhat spicy.   Non-Meats were delish!  Asparagus was crunchy with that nice BBQ taste, fries were excellent... I seem to be eating a lot of great fries lately.  They were crispy, thin and lightly battered.  Cauliflower was... forgettable, not really a fan of the veggie anyway and the cream was milky, not thick.  Great customer service by our waitress, the food did not take too long to come out.  Huge portions.  Good ambiance and did not wait for a table.  For $48, it was a good experience and for sure, doggy bag coming home.  The only thing for me that would put this place to 5 stars and over the mountain if the food was a tad more saucier.  Everything was hella dry which was okay but I just wanted to lick my lips and sauce everything up!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ house in Toronto! We enjoyed my wife's birthday on one Sunday. And enjoyed their family style dining. Yummy Delish! Definitely worth the visit to Roncy for this gem. Please make reservations."}
{"text":"Great service by Jade and Brenna tonight! Had the mac and cheese, fries, ribs, wings, and of course the cornbread! Service was quick and efficient and couldn't have asked for anything more! Leaving thoroughly filled and satisfied. Had the key lime for dessert with the cookie sundae, both great choices. Had a friend with a nut allergy and they accommodated us with it. Sparkling water at no charge! Bonus points!"}
{"text":"After hearing so much about Barque, and reading all the stellar reviews I was somewhat surprised and rather disappointed.  Living in a house with two smokers (charcoal and electric), I may have expected too much walking in the door.  The tacos we started with were to die for and I still crave them.  The meat platter for two was another matter.  I did not experience the glory others had.  The beef ribs were excellent but the baby back ribs were overcooked, dry and the meat did not easily fall off the bone.  The Cuban Corn was visibly over cooked from my perspective, the natural sweetness could not shine through.    Overall, a disappointing meal, especially when these oversights could have been caught in plating.  The Owner was visibly upset with our feedback and indicated that our experience was not the norm.  I am undecided whether I will return."}
{"text":"really tight seating but what's new downtown TO??? book in advance!  food is overrated here. the smokiness tastes fake - like liquid smoke instead of an actual smoker. Had the brisket,  not bad but not the best & for their prices I expected the best! bin of fries were salty... DH enjoyed his meal but I'm still underwhelmed...not planning a revisit & haven't recommended."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch today and it was overall a fantastic experience and I was impressed!  Service: I came around noon on a Sunday and there was a brief 15 minute wait for a table as the place was completely packed. The hostess took my information on an iPad, which allowed me to go grab coffee and wander until I could be seated. I was called when my table was ready and promptly seated. My table service was very efficient and polite. I quite liked my server! She was fantastic and considering how many tables she was managing, she was quite the pro. Timing was perfect for everything. Not too fast and not too slow. Just right.  Food: I ordered the smoked duck pancakes, which come with a berry compote and a whipped chevre. Duck is quite delicious and most known for being a particularly tender and juicy meant, so giving it a try in a smoked meat preparation was interesting. This dish is actually quite filling so I only finished half and I noticed this at other tables as well. Perhaps two could order this dish to share for breakfast.  Venue: Great interior design and a professional yet casual crowd. Not your typical hipster brunch scene, which was kind of refreshing."}
{"text":"Delicious. Affordale. Enjoyable environment.  Kudos to Jascha and his team for a serving up a great evening on their patio.    We gladly ordered multiple courses of perfectly cooked ribs.  Make sure to try the delicious pecan pie!"}
{"text":"I can't speak in regards to the other dishes as I ordered dry rub and sweat heat wings with a kale salad, but wow, the wings were really good, and I'm looking forward to going back, if you want some wings this is to place to go :)."}
{"text":"Barque was one of 2011's best new restaurants, without a doubt. I have been a two times, both for dinner and each experience has been delicious, hospitable and left me wanting more. The popcorn with BBQ sauces are a great idea-- they help to pass the time waiting for the delicious smokey goodness.   Things you MUST try: Brisket, dry rubbed chicken wings, cuban corn, chicken thighs.   Also, I enjoyed the exclusive support of Montreal micro-brewery St. Ambroise. The oatmeal stout is wonderful.   I don't recommend bringing the family on a regular night, however they host sunday night \"family\" dinners! The menus look delectable and this is a trend other restaurants might want to test out.  Overall the atmosphere is pleasant and casual, but nothing to write home about.   The food however speaks for it self. They smoke to perfection and definitely know what they're doing (the main chef/owner did a year of research before opening this place).   Barque is a MUST try, but always make reservations."}
{"text":"Anyone averse to meat, pork and in that order than this place is not for you.  Those who are the opposite and enjoy it smoked and bacon in their ceasars then I suggest you bring yourself here ASAP!!!!  A good time is had by all as the meal is enjoyable and the atmosphere is not bad either.  I would recommend staying clear of the iced sweet tea....that it is neither southern nor Canadian style aka enjoyable.  Otherwise you will walk away in a delicious coma of smoked meat."}
{"text":"Was downtown on biz & was looking for some BBQ. Saw this local shop and decided to stop in.  I ordered the Beef Brisket sandwich with a side of coleslaw. The sandwich was sparsely populated with beef and I found it to be really fatty. So much so that I had to stop & cut off the extra fat.   I'm happy that I asked for the coleslaw to be served off-sandwich, wasn't a fan of that flavour. The side coleslaw that I ordered was tasty but only mildly. Service from Tessa was solid!"}
{"text":"Come, eat at the most over-rated, over-crowded restaurant on Roncesvalles and pay a fortune for it!  We managed to get into this place on a Tuesday night after 9pm without a reservation.  Why people even NEED to make a reservation in this place is mind-boggling but it's usually packed, which is why we went.  Started with chicken wings and an arugula salad with nuts.  Chicken wings were coated in that orange spice you find on BBQ potato chips... you know, MSG and food colouring.  True genius.  They give you fancy brushes to put on your choice of disgusting mustard sauce or disgusting ketchup sauce.  There's also popcorn at the table, also covered in orange powder... why, I don't know.  Salad was actually very good, very fresh.  Not bad for a place known for its MEAT!  Then came the main course... chicken, marinated in liquid orange BBQ sauce, beef brisket, marinated in liquid orange BBQ sauce and ribs with a dry rub.  Our sides were red bean rice and their fancy schmancy fried potatoes covered in spicy red mayo.  Chicken was very orange.  Tasted orange.  Like BBQ powder.  Go figure.  Beef brisket... the stuff they put in smoked meat sandwiches... also orange.  Though somewhat better than the chicken but definitely not very good.  Ribs were actually good but as with all ribs, it's mostly bone.  But they are done in a dry rub and don't taste like all the other BBQ sauced meats.  Of the meats, by far the best thing.  Maybe better to just order ribs?  The red bean rice was the best thing on the table hands down.  I'd go back to order that and the salad, at the meat restaurant...  The fried potato thing was so salty it was nearly inedible.  They give you complimentary bottles of still or soda water, you will need it so you don't dry out and lay down and die.  Then they brought dessert which was some ice-cream Fredo thing... I don't know, it was meh.  Sadly, I knew this place was all hype and I was right.  Cost us $100 for two people for the above mentioned meal and one glass of wine.  I left with an insatiable thirst for water.  Never again but if I'm forced to go, I will stick to the salad and red bean rice.    Wait staff is nice, the singing bartender was the best part of the night.  He can almost hit the notes in A-Ha's \"Take On Me\".  Impressive!"}
{"text":"Great pulled pork w apple and relish sandwich!  Do not sit on patio if you don't like wasps crawling over food and drink!"}
{"text":"First off, I don't know what people are talking about - my boyfriend and I went there for Sunday brunch and had GREAT service.  Our waiter was super helpful, pleasant, and friendly.    My boyfriend and I were looking for a new brunch place and happened upon Barque by accident.  One sniff and we were in.  Being from the South, I was personally SUPER excited that their whiskey selection was mainly bourbon (sorry Canadians, rye isn't as good...), and quickly ordered a mint julep to go with my brunch.  Delish!  It's been so long...haha.    Anyways, my boyfriend got the hash skillet with smoked brisket, fried egg, potatoes cooked in bacon, and peppers in your own personal mini cast iron.  Lovely.  He is also a huge hot sauce fan, and when he asked about getting some for his food, the waiter told him that they only had the one they made in house(YES!), with smoked scotch bonnet peppers and mango.  'Nuff said.  I got the savory pancake and OH MAN...SO GOOD.  Smoked duck LEG (yay dark meat!) on three perfectly fluffy pancakes with blueberry compote and chevre.  Heavenly.  I was sort of wary of getting a savory pancake, or even pancakes since I'm usually not a big fan, but I'm seriously glad I did.  No idea how I finished it.  I think my boyfriend did actually.    Have we gushed about this place to all of our friends?  Yes.  Was our meal a bit pricey?  Yes, but the quality was totally worth it, especially when it's more average than higher-than average.  Will we be back for lunch, dinner, brunch, or perhaps all of these?  Yes."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch and really enjoyed it. It did a pretty good job of having a bbq theme while also not just being a bbq place. Atmosphere was also very nice, even at the bar where we sat. It was narrow but inviting inside. I had the brisket sandwich with fries. My partner got eggs, beans and bbq chicken. I enjoyed both, though probably preferred mine. It was a pretty good value as well. If I lived in Toronto I would definitely make my way out here from time to time."}
{"text":"Best bbq in town. Dinner is really good, but brunch is even better! Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Probably hands down one of my favourite BBQ places in the city and worth the trek to Roncy. We got a seat on the patio which was really nice and fully covered. When the sun went down they opened the top a little and the breeze felt amazing considering how hot the weekend was. Also, love that they had brown paper bags hanging around the patio. The server explained that this was to get rid of the pesky wasps - it worked! Didn't see a single wasp during dinner.   First I started dinner with a candied bacon caesar - it was nice and spicy and flavourful. Definitely recommend it. They also have complimentary sparkling water to start. Service was really good throughout the night as well. Our table ordered the 4oz brisket, was nervous it would be too little to share but it was the perfect amount for 2 people. Absolutely LOVED the brisket. My favourite of the meal. We also ordered half a rack of ribs, smoked asparagus and the potato and leek salad. Would definitely recommend both sides. The asparagus gave a nice balance to our meal with the heavy potatoes and meat. They also don't cheap out on side portions so that was good to see.   I'll definitely be back, and next time would want to try the brunch and smoked wings! Overall highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Chose this restaurant based off of the Yelp reviews and my friend's Google search. We were looking for food our first night in Toronto and this spot was close to our place. The service was amazing from the time we were greeted and seated at the bar until it was time to leave. The food was AMAZING and the price was reasonable (based on the taste and quality I would expect it to be more). I also appreciate that they served sparkling water which tasted great as well. When I'm back in Toronto I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Ordered a variety platter they offered on their menu for $39 per person and there was 2 of us.   Wings - lemon pepper, thought they were excellent.   Ribs - meaty and soft, pretty good.   Pulled pork - good but nothing special  Brisket - good but nothing special and way too fat.   Rice - too dry and mediocre.   Smores desert - terrible.   Giving it 2 stars bc it seems way overpriced. With tax and tip it came to about $105. Definitely did not seem like a $100 dinner. While the cut of meat seemed fresh and good, at this price I expect to be impressed and they just didn't do it for me. Sauces are a smoky bbq type of flavour, but you can find that at a lot of places and for a more moderate price. Plus they marinated everything in the same sauce and that just makes it boring. Better value elsewhere."}
{"text":"This review is for takeout. I ordered on a Saturday night with no problems. I was directed to go to the back of the restaurant to pick up. The place was packed. I almost felt it was past capacity. No problems, that's why my bf and I decided to take out and eat at home, in peace.   The food? It was good. It didn't blow me away for the prices we've paid. ($78) We ordered the rib sampler, brisket, green beans and Mac and cheese.  We both favored only one of the 3 rib choices. The green beans container was absolutely not full, which is disappointing. The Mac and cheese container barely could contain itself. I thought they forgot our brisket because it was on the bottom of ribs. We really didn't know how that should've tasted because all the sauce from the 3 different types of ribs had already covered it. I would suggest they package everything separately.   Overall, mehhhhhh. I've had better bbq, for a better price."}
{"text":"We got take-out from Barque since we live nearby and have heard that the lines get long.  We ordered a sampler platter for two, plus extra sides, plus the vegetarian entree. Overall, the food was good but not great. Actually, the vegetarian entree (some cheesy vegetable thing) was one of the best things we sampled. The brisket and ribs were only ok, but the sausages were good. We received a little baggie of popcorn with our food, which was a nice touch.   The french fries and kale were really good. The fact that the fries still tasted good at home is what makes me think that the meat wouldn't have been much better fresh out of the kitchen.  Given the price we paid, the portions were really small and we weren't too impressed with the food.  I'm not willing to wait in line and pay top dollar all over again to find out if our experience was an exceptionally bad one."}
{"text":"I came to Barque for brunch for a second time a couple weeks back. And it was a fairly inconsistent experience. Some of the food there remained pretty good, though some things missed the mark.  I ordered the brisket eggs benedict, because I was lured by the side salad with beets. Though I came thinking I was gonna get the smoked duck pancakes. Though when the salad arrived, there was no beets to be seen. I found that a little odd considering it was the fall and beets were in season. So, you can't exactly trust what you order on said menu will actually be what's on your plate. On top of that the little potato hash browns or latkes or whatever you want to call them were quite hard and overcooked. They should have been crispy on the outside, and softer on the inside, but they were basically crispy little hockey pucks. I will probably be back again someday, as I've been here a few times, and it's possible to have a good meal. But I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"I can't give this restaurant any stars because I didn't get to eat because the service was sooooo bad.  I should preface this by saying although I appreciate good service, I'm hardly fussy and have NEVER left a restaurant because of poor service.  I made the trip out here on Friday June 17 around noon because it sounded great from all the reviews.  My boyfriend and I were very excited to try the food.  We had a friendly greeting and were off to a good start after telling the man who sat us that we came out of our way because we were eager to try it.  We sat at the bar because it was busy (totally fine by us) and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  All while there were 2 men in suits (owners/managers?) and a server standing at the back of the restaurant chatting.  Since no one came by for a good ten minutes we asked the bartender if they had the meat platter we read about at lunch since it wasn't on the menu.  She gave us horrible attitude and shamed us for even asking about it at lunch since it was strictly for dinner.  After more time with no service we asked the same bartender for water (since no one had come by yet despite us trying to flag someone down) and she poured us two small half full glasses of tepid water.  That was the final straw and we left.  Barque, the food looked great and I may come back one day but as a suggestion...work on your service; it doesn't have to be top-notch, just decent!"}
{"text":"Wow, great place!! Went here for brunch.   We didn't have reservations but they seated us on the patio, which was perfect. It was hot but patio was covered so it worked out.   Everything we ordered was yummy. Service was wonderful.   Located in a cute area/neighborhood."}
{"text":"This so now our go to BBQ place. Great chicken wings (try with the dry rub).  Great kale salad.  Ribs were really good.  Nice beer selection.  My wife had a cocktail she loved... I think it was the Smoke Whisky Sour.  Loved the fries.  We need to go back and try the pulled pork.    Got in Wed night without a reservation but waitress recommended for Fri or Sat."}
{"text":"Read the rave reviews...so expectations were high....and Barque didn't disappoint! Apps, mains, service...all outstanding.  Loved: Smoked Trout on Purple Potatoes Braised Beef Rib Pulled Pork Slider Smoked Wings Brisket Dry Rub baby back ribs Smashed Potatoes Smoked Brussel Sprouts (seriously...) Pecan Pie Lucy (our waitress)  Liked: Beef Rib Broccolini Hummus  Meh: Spicy Fries Smoked Asparagus  Bustling place on a Friday night. No surprise!  They were even super accommodating when our party (of 3) was 20 mins late because of horrendous traffic.  Great winelist with a wide variety in terms of wines and budgets! And thet even have a BYOB policy with a corking fee...bravo!  One suggestion: take transit. Parking is street parking where ever you can....and streets are very narrow (ok ok....I won't take the pickup next time....)  Thank you Barque! Great night!"}
{"text":"I went for a long walk this morning and part of my walk was north on Roncesvalles Avenue.  I passed by Barque Smokehouse and was hungry so decided to stop in for brunch.  I'd never been there before.  I ordered Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Waffles.  My meal came out really quickly ... too quickly.  Not surprising, the waffles and the chicken were cold.  I've had chicken and waffles before elsewhere so knew they were supposed to be hot.  I was going to call over my server when I came across a substantial piece of wire scouring pad.  Ewwwww!  Needless to say, that was it for me!  Thankfully I'd only had a couple bites before I found it.  My server asked me if I'd like anything else.  No thanks!  She gave me a small bottle of meat rub as an apology.  She handled the situation professionally.  Not a great first impression!  UPDATE:  My response to Barque's comment:  I do understand that mistakes happen and am glad you are taking steps so it doesn't happen again.  With my meal, it wasn't just one thing.  The waffles and chicken were cold when they should have been hot.  Finding the wire scouring pad made the experience even worse.  That scouring pad could have been in some gross places and I could/might have ingested some of it.  The server was nice about it.  She did ask if I wanted to order something else ... I wasn't offered a complimentary replacement meal.  Considering I'd only had four bites from my meal, it would have been inappropriate to have been charged for it.  I did offered to pay for my pop."}
{"text":"What an amazing place for brunch! Staff was very friendly, I ordered the smoked duck pancakes along with a side of delicious corn bread. Taste buds exploded with all of the wonderful flavours."}
{"text":"This food is to die for. Especially the Dry Rub Chicken Wings!!! Amazing service!"}
{"text":"great tasting meat that's not cooked to death! by far my favourite restaurant in the junction. they have takeout too!"}
{"text":"The ONLY reason I knocked down a star is for the service. Food was some of the best I've ever had. It was full on a Tuesday night but not crazy. Our waitress didn't ask if we wanted anymore drinks. She wasn't at all friendly. And, when we asked for change we just got such an attitude. Might want to think of reconsidering your staff! Also, some of our food was cold when we got it. Everything was still quite delicious, though.."}
{"text":"I've been to Barque quite a few times now, and love it every single time. We normally stand the long wait times for the well worth waiting for food. We normally get an order of the Sampler for one (with some extra meat) or two (depending on how hungry we are) and some sides. The beef brisket is the absolute bomb. Definitely order this, same as the baby back ribs. Normally get the Cuban corn and some grilled veggies/ on the side. If the wait wasn't as long this would get 5 stars.  PS: try their signature drinks!"}
{"text":"After all these years, they've still got it. The food is still excellent and it makes for a fun casual night. Glad the wait times have died down a bit now."}
{"text":"Ate here with 3 friends with the total coming to $75 with tip. Great place if you are looking for ribs, which I would say is their specialty. Half rack is about $16 with a choice of 3 different flavours. Full rack is approx. $30: I would say good for 2 people who are of average stature. It will be tempting but the fries are not a good order as they are overly salty. Wings are good but don't think it's $12 good. Draft beer is $8.  Make reservation please.  Go for: ribs, ribs, and ribs  Don't go for: everything else is a toss up"}
{"text":"We ordered half chicken, lib and mac and cheese. It didnt take long to get the food after we order but the temperature of all foods wasnt hot when we bite once as soon as the food was approached us. And the mac and cheese is not tasty. Cheese was supposed to be stretched some but it wasnt and it felt like just mayonnaise taste. We were little disappointed. Service was good."}
{"text":"Barque Smokehouse - Dinner in Roncesvalles Village in Toronto on a Friday in August 2013  Barque Smokehouse, Toronto, ON Food: Barbeque http://barque.ca  Overall: 6.8 vs. restaurants priced at $$$/5.  Ambiance: Good.  Food: Very Good.  Service: Very Good.  Wine/Drinks: Good.  My rating scale: Exceptional, Very Good, Good, Ok, Needs Improvement, Terrible.  Overall: There aren't too many BBQ joints in Toronto so it was nice to hit one with some solid food, especially one with a mega 500 lb smoker in the kitchen. Barque's  David Neinstein and Jonathon Persofsky call their place \"Toronto's Urban Barbeque - a lighter and healthier take on barbeque\". On the beverage side, they offer up some good local microbrews and it's interesting that they are pairing wine with BBQ (I need to explore this more).  Ambiance: Barque is on a nice corner in Roncesvalles Village. It has a nice floral side patio that hugs Geoffrey Street. Nothing spoils patio seating more than rain, and it poured this night, but Barque is equipped to handle it given they've invested in a quality remote control awning. No Labatt's Blue beach umbrellas here. Side note: maybe it's the sugar from the BBQ sauce or the flowers surrounding the deck, but you should be aware, there are wasps that dive in and out of the eating area. For those that are fearful of wasps it would a horrible situation.   Food: Toronto isn't known as a BBQ hotbed so I wasn't expecting Barque to do its ribs so well; the meat literally falls off the bone. One bite of the moist meat and you'll quickly realize Barque does ribs very well. It doesn't hurt that the portion size is more than sufficient too. Like all good BBQ, making it takes patience...the brisket is cooked for hours in the huge smoker, which I read is straight from Tennessee. We ordered the Barque platter consisting of ribs, chicken, brisket, and sides. The meat is smothered in incredible, sweet barbecue sauce. Over the years, I've eaten some incredible brisket (Salt Lick BBQ in Austin, Bangers on Rainy Street in Austin, Hill Country in NY, BBQ fest in Madison Square Park) and barbeque connoisseurs can get pretty particular about their brisket. So, in critiquing Barque's brisket, although it is very good, when dining at Barque, if you only have one option, order the ribs. For sides I highly recommend the Mexican corn on the cob, it was the clear winner of the night. I'd steer you away from the fries unless you want sweet fries. The fries are rubbed in cinnamon and taste more like dessert.   Service: At first, I thought it was just our waitress that lacked style, wearing light colored, \"mom bum\" jean shorts but then I realized it wasn't just her and all of the waitresses were wearing that uniform, which made it all ok. I like that the restaurant is going after a southern look for its staff. It's a tough look to pull off, but our server was able to with a smile.   Wine/Drinks: I like how Barque is exploring wine and BBQ. I believe there is a wine for every food and many activities. Wine is not meant only to opine upon the cedar, leather, cherry, and licorice notes. It's also meant to be drank and drank with food; BBQ is food. Barque was one of the first restaurants to create a wine-on-tap program, and they say that one out of every three glasses of wine comes from the tap. If I could critique, Barque should hire an experienced mixologist and load its menu with interesting bourbon and whiskey cocktails. David and Jonathon: Nashville's Patterson House is a great spot to get some ideas, no one does cocktails better.   Eat well my friends, - www.JustAGuyThatLovesFood.tumblr.com"}
{"text":"Great food. Had the ribs, brisket, chicken,  Cuban corn and wings. Everything was made well and service was excellent.  I'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I really love this place. All those Smokey foods are great. There is always long waitings in weekends so its better ti  go late night or book in advance."}
{"text":"Big fan of the pulled pork here. The meat is flavourful , juicy and has a great smokey taste.  They offer a great brunch menu. Who doesn't want to start the day off with BBQ?? They have a shop about two doors down with helpful staff that sell the restaurants runs and sauces."}
{"text":"VIBE  Down to earth. Family friendly. Great and smiling service even though they were busy right at 5pm on Thanksgiving. Pros.   I ATE The BBQ sampler for one is great value (it's now $25). I choose short ribs (for the win!), beef ribs (if you want it really meaty) and chicken thigh (good portion).   My favourite side was the caesar salad. It's a lighter compliment to the meat, there is just the right amount of dressing and cheese and the candied bacon is delish!  Wasn't a fan of the cuban corn. The sauce was a bit spicy to me and a bit all over the place. I will try the tomato salad (and burger) next time.  Funny how on my first visit I liked the cuban corn.   I hope they introduce the burger at dinner in the future.  Barque adds the hipster touch with homemade iced tea in a mason jar. Light and refreshing.  OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Barque's got bite!"}
{"text":"Try the dry rubbed ribs!! So good. Also the wings. Anything dry rubbed. Quick service and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"So I went to Barque tonight and have never seen a place as busy on a Monday. After waiting for 20 minute for a seat at the bar I started with a simple beer. Went with the GF and we started with the Wings, from the first bite the made me fan. The smoke flavor with a combination of the char on the wing with the heat of the chipotle I was already a fan. We quickly killed those wings while enjoying every bite. We then moved onto some cocktails while we waited for our meals to come (she ordered the ribs while I went for the chicken). Not sure if you have ever had a drink with smoked lime in it but its a must try, smoked flavor in a drink is just the thing. After my 2nd drink the chicken was served and lets just say it was EVERYTHING I could have hoped for. Tender, juicy and full of flavor, the sides also good but could not get my mind off the smoke flavor in the chicken. After devouring every last bit of chicken (if I was at home the bones would have been destroyed also) we moved onto the dessert. Pecan pie with ice cream, and let me tell you this by far the best pie ever. the crust perfect tasty and flaky, the filling full of HUGE pecan pieces and a spoonful of ice cream in every bite. Love the fact that the pie was not to sweet, perfect sweetness at the end of a great meal. For 2 people we spent 124$ (60 a person and I had 3 cocktails) a must try got the BBQ smoke enthusiastic out there  , can not wait to return!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was here on a Sunday night.  The menu and service were great... place had a super friendly laid back vibe.  Only complaint is that the food seemed 'tired' - like it was all pre-made in massive batches and by the time it was served to us it was a bit old."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had in the city, closely followed by Stockyards. While the food between the two places is comparable Barque is aimed at being slightly higher class with a decent bar and wine list along with fine decor. If you like smoked food, I'd highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I highly recommend starting with the dry rub smoked wings.  We ordered 1lb; literally devoured it.  So we ordered another 1lb; devoured that too.  We then ordered another 1lb (LOL); devoured that.  In a Nutshell, BEST WINGS I ever had! So tasty and the dry rub is beyond perfection!    ALL this while we are waiting for our order:  Sampler for Two - MEATS: brisket, 2 beef ribs, 2 competition chicken thighs or (barque rack 'o bama). Let me say; Every element on that dish was PERFECTION! Brisket, melting in your mouth.  Beef ribs, meat melting off the bone, big YUM factor right there. Chicken Thighs, so juicy and tender.  Sides were good too but we were already stuffed!   NOT STUFFED enough for the pecan pie and cinnamon ice cream and let me just say WOW WOW WOW! OFF THE CHARTS!!!    Will definitely be going back...for repeat"}
{"text":"The Mr and I went to Barque for a celebratory dinner last weekend. We are both big BBQ fans, and he had been raving about Barque for a while. We ordered the sampler, which included the following on that day: (1) arugula salad w/ a lemon-shallot vinaigrette (2) smoked wings (3) 1/2 rack of ribs, 1/2 chicken, brisket (~3 oz), and BBQ pork (~3 oz) (4) sautéed garlic green beans w/ sliced almonds and fingerling potatoes topped w/ jalapeno, cheddar (5) brownie w/ pistachio cream. A bit pricey at just over $80 but it was a lot of food and the quality of the meat was evident.  Overall, I have to say I was satisfied with my meal but not really blown away. Highlights: - The SMOKED WINGS were stellar. I would come back to this restaurant simply for another plate of these crispy little things. The rub reminded me of a honey-chipotle rub that I use at home and absolutely adore - a smokey, slightly sweet, very rich flavour that is profoundly satisfying for a BBQ lover. - The CHICKEN and the PORK were juicier than I've ever had. I suspect both cuts of meat are treated to a decent brining before being cooked. Regardless, in both cases I didn't feel the need to dress the meat up with extra sauce - it was flavourful and succulent without all the extra fuss.  Disappointments: - The RIBS were small, the dry rub was odd (but not bad), and the meat itself was not fall-off-the-bone as I would've liked. They weren't bad I was just expecting a lot more. - The BRISKET. What happened here? Dry, bland..blergh. 24 hour brisket should be buttery and tender, not whatever that was.  TLDR; Wings are bomb, ribs are all about expectations, atmosphere is good if snug, prices are high but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"went last weekend. You need reservations.  I booked in advance.  Free sparking or tap water and popcorn was nice.  Decor was cool. Modern industrial feel.  Cool bar, floors, tables, washrooms.  Nachos and platter for 2 plus tip was around $65.  Good portions, good food, great BBQ for Toronto."}
{"text":"I had a blonde moment the other day while approaching Barque.  I took the Queen streetcar all the way down to Roncesvalles, i approached the restaurant and i saw on their chalkboard that they allow smoking indoor.  I was gobsmacked, i thought, wait you cant smoke indoors in Ontario!!  Then, i was like, oh they smoke their meats, of course.  Needless to say i am glad that we went in.  We came for lunch and i was actually surprised at how packed the place was.  I had the Barque Brisket sandwich with red cabbage slaw, fried onions & horseradish mayo with their Barque Caesar.  The sandwich was fantastic, the meat was super tender, and smoky, and i loved the texture that the fried onions added.  I had the Caesar and it was alright, it needed more citrus, and more garlic, but it was a good side.  My sis had the  Halibut sandwich with avocado, tomatoes, fried capers & arugula.  She actually commented that there was too much fish, the portion size was too large for lunch.  Now i don't know if they were running out of avocado that day, but i looked at the sammy and there was the tiniest amount of green on the bun, the sandwich really would have excelled with less fish and more avocado.  She had the Cuban corn as her side and she said it was money, so delicious.  It was slightly charred, and citrusy, a real hit.  Overall i really liked Barque, fair prices, good quality food, and a great vibe.  Next time i would like to come back for supper."}
{"text":"Absolutely an amazing restaurant. It was my first trip to Toronto and I can assume you I will return here when I return. Tried my first cesear and it was absolutely delicious. I really enjoyed the bacon mixtures rib. The food was even more to rave about. The seasoning on the potatoes was every bit of savory. Was really happy when the server gave us some on the way out. The meat was tender and I cannot really remember the rest because I was so blown away."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. When I'm craving smoked meat or ribs this place comes to mind. Dry rub ribs, beef brisket... It's all very delicious.   Very hyped up so the wait is long and can be more than an hour at times, and even then you've got a seat at the bar. The sides are very mediocre but the meat is amazingly delicious and top notch. Do not waste valuable tummy real estate on the sides.   I get delivery from them, which is a more favourable, less stressful experience."}
{"text":"For a casual weeknight date, sitting up at the bar at Barque was none too shabby. The long and fragrant room was bustling with happy noshers when we arrived and the host offered the last seats in house to us. Our coats were immediately taken and seasoned popcorn sat waiting when we jumped onto the bar stools moments later. A carafe each of tap and complementary sparkling water arrived soon after.  While sampling the house made barbecue sauce and mustard by dipping my popcorn, my eye fell onto the barbecue sampler (choosing beef rib, pork ribs with spicy sauce, and chicken thigh). My sides of cuban corn and pickled veggies made complementary sides to the heavy meat main. Whisky selections from the large drink menu washed everything down nicely.   My dinner date's visibly daunting half chicken was reported to be tender. Although he complained that there were not enough fries in proportion to the main, I thought it would have been plenty for my liking. By choosing to doggy bag a portion of each our meals, we managed to save space for a shared piece of brownie with rich vanilla ice cream.   Our young male server was genuine and the over the counter service was refreshing. It was interesting to have a peek at the servers and cooks prepping dishes and tending to the smoker as we savoured our scrumptious meals."}
{"text":"Finally went to check out Barque Fri night. I know this place is hyped a lot because of the BBQ.   The popcorn on the table is a nice touch. It is very addictive because of the seasoning on it. I went with a friend and we ordered the wings, ribs, brisket and sausage. The wings were the best. They were juicy on the inside and with a nice crispy rub on the outside. The ribs and sausage were good. But the brisket was a disappointment. I have been to Adamson BBQ a couple of times and their brisket is out of this world. Compared to Adamson, Barque's brisket is a bit tough. I won't be getting that again. I will definitely go back just for the wings. Also had a smoked bourbon cocktail and it was good."}
{"text":"Have to Yelp them down for rudeness on the phone. I called to make a reservation and the girl on the phone won't take one even though they aren't full. I'm sorry but this is a BBQ place not Nobu. I live in the neighborhood and want a table for 2 in a half full restaurant/dive bar. It's not THAT good that they can be pricks... Compared to any BBQ place in the US. They lose 4/5 stars for their shitty attitude."}
{"text":"Dry, tough, generic ribs. Tiny portions. Overpriced."}
{"text":"We came to Barque on a Sunday night and had the set menu which consisted of Arugula Frisée salad, Hilltop Wings, an assortment of pulled pork, beef brisket and ribs followed up with a Coconut cream pie in a jar dessert - $35/ea. There was a $15 corking fee for our wine which was fine, the salad came quickly but was nothing to write home about, a little tart but otherwise fine. The Wings were not to my liking, perhaps it was the spices as I don't believe the chicken wings themselves were an issue. The honey mustard on the side was nice though. This is where things derailed, there was a 40 min delay between the wings and the main course BBQ platter, needless to say we consumed a lot of complimentary popcorn during the wait. When the platter came out, we were all really hungry and dug in, most didn't like the cornbread as it was laced with spices (probably pepper) as they couldn't handle the heat, i thought this was the highlight of the platter along with the corn and loaded potatoes! The brisket was ok as was the pulled pork, nothing special here. However, the ribs were rubbed with typical spices vigorously and looked charred but wasn't really, a couple of bites in and it revealed tough, chewy almost jerky like meat that was far from 'falling off the bone.' I only had one to realize I wasn't interested in having more as it was even difficult to cut with a knife. The portions were enough for us as most of us didn't eat all that much since we didn't enjoy the food but most would be disappointed with the portion size. Many reviewers speak of how much better the BBQ is here over Nashville etc... while I've never been to Nashville, I can say that the BBQ places I've been to in California, New York State and Florida are far superior. Even Smoke Meat Pete's outside of Montreal was better. Well, we tried it, didn't like it and won't be back. The exorbitant fee ($3/ea) for cutting 10 pieces of birthday cake is ridiculous, so we left the cake for home."}
{"text":"Lemon pepper dry rubbed ribs were out of this world-- seasoned and smoked to perfection at that perfect balance of toastiness and moist. Also, the smoked chicken wings were pretty amazing-- everything had the right amount of spice and was done perfectly.  I even enjoyed the coleslaw, and I am not a coleslaw person because it's usually bad, but this was house-made (I assume) with a more vinegary base than the typical mayonnaisey mess that you usually get. Sides were good-- not exceptional but good.  I subtract one star because it seems like they are perhaps working out some service issues-- it took a super long time for us to get our food and get seated. The server was quite apologetic about it, but I don't think it was at all his fault-- seemed kind of like there were some bigger structural issues going on (for example, it took us a long time to get seated and we arrived when they opened and there was no line). It was also pretty spendy for lunch, though I'm not sure if it was just a matter of us needing to order different things."}
{"text":"BEST wings i have ever had anywhere before. The food is delicious, wouldn't recommend for a vegetarian though as all options are pretty much meat. Your food is not hot when you get it as it is cooked very slowly and at a low temperature, so its an interesting place to try. But this location is SWARMED with wasps, so if you are afraid like me id recommend sitting inside."}
{"text":"I wish this review could be about the food but we never got the chance.  Stopped into Barque on a Thursday night around 8pm sans reservations (my bad!).  Was told that there was a wait list of about 30-45 min for either a seat at the bar or a table.  We put our name/number on the list and headed up to the Intersteer for a drink.    After an hour, we decided to check back in and see what was going on with the wait list.  When we returned, the young, frazzled hostess said that she could seat us at the bar in about 5 min but as soon as those words came out of her mouth, she said she was mistaken.  Checking her iPad and then talking to who I'll assume was the manager, she reneged on the bar seats and we were told that due to overbooking of reservations, they were no longer seating any other tables for the rest of the night.  Well, that's fine but that information would have been useful an hour ago!    I'm not sure if reservations would have helped.  While waiting in the doorway, we talked to a group who actually had reservations and still had been waiting close to an hour for their table.  I'd be wary about going to Barque again - with or without reservations."}
{"text":"So far so good!  Clean. Trendy. Nice staff. Good atmosphere.   We ordered the beef brisket sandwich and apple and brie French toast.   Excited to see what it's like...  It was everything we had hoped for!  Brisket sandwich was great. It was tender and full of flavour. Onions, horseradish mayo, cabbage. All yummers.  Fries also had a nice spice.   It was all spices enough but not spicy.    The apple and brie French toast was also spectacular.  Huge portions, fresh, hot. Yummers too!  Service was great. Waitress kept refilling our water (it's a hot one today).   Whenever we're back in the area, we'll visit again.   Don't hesitate. Full recommendations.    Next time I'll try to come here for dinner. The meatier options also looked very appetizing!"}
{"text":"Went to Barque for brunch on a Sunday. Food Network was filming 'You gotta Eat here' so I knew right then and there that we were in for a treat. The place filled up half an hour after it opened so luckily we got there upon opening because we had a party of 8. If you plan on eating here for dinner I suggest making a reservation (if they allow) because this place will sit around 40 people max.   For the menu, well that's the best part and it's just brunch. Some items popped up and said 'EAT ME' and they were the: Barque Benedict (cornbread, poached eggs, beef brisket with hollandaise sauce), Pancakes (smoked duck, yeah that's right, duck!, blueberry compote), and Caramelized Apple French Toast (with brie cheese and cinnamon crumble). While I was deciding on what to get, one of the waiters writes on a small chalkboard 'special of the day - rack of baby back ribs with salad and fries'. this decision just got tougher. I decided that this place will need another visit, at least. I eventually went with the Benedict because I was feeling for eggs and I wasn't disappointed. It was just made to perfection even the cornbread was great. the beef brisket was tender and delicious. Oh, and it comes with a salad on the side.  Other item I tried: Smoked Candied Bacon - it sounds super delicious AND it is. it just depends where you bite onto it. you can taste the strong seasoning at the ends of the bacon which wasn't so great but overall, still super delish. Also, a friend of mine ordered a caesar and it had candied bacon on the rim and sides of the glass. I went on ahead and started picking them off the glass when he was done with the drink.   Overall, the food was amazing and i'll definately be back for dinner (menu is drool-worthy). The setting and ambiance is what you would expect from a local, 'you must eat here' type of restaurant. I just wished they opened a place like Barque in North York where it is much closer to me."}
{"text":"3.5 stars   Whoever is in charge of the menu or marketing is a bit of a genius... Barque Rack O'Bama.  Really??  This is honestly one of the best named dishes in Toronto and probably one of the key reasons why I tried this place before the other best Toronto BBQ places.  Aside from the great name, Barque on Roncy is a nice family friendly bar.  Though the tables for 2 are really small and barely held the dishes on it, the space is bigger than most places on Roncy and you're not overly crowded.  There's a bit of bar seating for those who dont have a reservations and you do need a rez here.  It gets busy quickly on a Saturday with a constant flow of families.    Service here is friendly and fairly quick.  We were greeted and shown to our tables with no issues.  We had our food also delivered with an issue as well.  Chopped Kale Salad - Ok I know I know... who gets a salad at a BBQ place.  Well I do cause I dont eat THAT much meat and I wasn't feeling mac & cheese or poutine side.  Which by the way looked monstrous.  We got a large and I will say its a very healthy size... easily feeds 2+.  It was nicely dressed and the pickled cabbage and carrots was a nice crunchy addition.  The fat white blobs of turnip... less so.  Mostly flavourless.  3.5/5  Rib Taster - Star of the meal... you get 3 to 4 ribs per sauce flavour.  So the Barque Rack O'Bama, Sweet Heat, and Dry Rub.  I can safely say that the sauces and flavour is good.  There are definite clear smoke rings on these which is much better than most other places.  Were these tender?  Only one... the sweet heat.  Were they meaty? Kinda ... not really.  I found it weird they didnt take off the membrane on the ribs either so sometimes it felt like chewing through a tough plastic piece.  This is definitely above average ribs but I'm not sure I would order these automatically if I came back here.  3.5/5  Brisket - We got a bit of the brisket as well and these were much better than the Smoke Signals and Carbon ones.  These were juicier and more tender.  And if you had the appetite of a hungry cub, you could order the larger size for only a few more dollars ($4 if I remember right).  Another good thing, I didnt feel the need to use the sauce for these.  Also, I liked how they were served above lukewarm temperatures (Carbon & Smoke was just barely warm)! 3.5/5  Overall, it's a solid place on Roncy to dine with a group of family or friends.  Service is good and the food is solid too.  Though I dont think it's my favourite place in Toronto for BBQ, it can definitely understand why it is constantly filled on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"I went to Barque based on a friend's recommendation. Overall, I was pleased with my experience. Here are the highlights and lowlights:  There's popcorn on every table when you sit down. I mean, that's great - a fun way to start the meal and a great alternative to filling bread.   The food, overall, was good. For two, we ordered:  -the dry rub wings (amazing; delicious; get these) -the brisket (12-hour roasted, house specialty....it was lacking. Least favourite item we ordered - a disappointment) -The barbecued pork (so good! Get the large and skip the brisket ) -The fries (sounds a bit boring but they were very tasty) -The green beans (simple but delicious - and a much needed green with a meal of mostly meat)  The service was slightly wobbly - they didn't know where to sit us despite having a reservation, and the server's menu walk through didn't leave us excited. Still, good service - quick an with a smile.   If you want to explore your carnivorous side and have a lot of fun while doing it, Barque is for you."}
{"text":"The beef brisket was dry and bland. The fries were kinda sad. The duck pancake was alright but the goat cheese ruined it. I brought my bf here for his birthday thinking he would enjoy the meat but we both weren't impressed."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try Barque for years (literally) because they were highly touted as a great barbecue restaurant in Toronto. I finally got a chance this week after visiting High Park and seeing the Sakura blossoms. Unfortunately, Barque's reputation didn't live up to what \"The Globe and Mail\" once called \"the best barbecue in the west\" (https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/food-and-wine/restaurant-reviews/barque-smokehouse-the-best-barbecue-in-the-west/article629096/; article published in 2011 and updated May 3, 2018 so they must still stand by that assertion. This was also the article that convinced me years back to try this place one day).   The decor is still trendy and fits in with the Roncy neighborhood. We were told there might be a half hour wait for a table but it turned out to be just a couple minutes. When we sat down we noticed three other tables that were bare. The staff were friendly but busy. We waited a while between ordering drinks and finally ordering food, even though we were ready for a while and looked around for a server.  We ordered the sampler, $59+tax and tip for any starter (we chose the pulled pork poutine), three meats (ribs with O'bama sauce, brisket, and pulled lamb shoulder) and two sides (Cuban corn and smoked asparagus). In short, the food was overcooked because it came out dry and added an extra chew to the meal.  The fries in the poutine were cooked well and soft on the inside, or soaked up the gravy well. However, there wasn't that much pulled pork on top, and quite dry. The flavours were good though and the meal started off well.  Next, the sides and main. The corn was smothered in sauce but also looked a bit burnt. It didn't taste really burnt, but it was not a juicy as it could've been. The asparagus was meh, nothing special and I can't justify spending $8 just for that if not for the deal. The pulled lamb shoulder was again dry and while the flavours were good, they were my least favourite of the three tonight. The brisket was also a let down. I love brisket and really tried to like it here but while briskets at other restaurants just melt in your mouth, this one was dry, especially if you didn't eat the fattier parts. The best part of the meal were the ribs. They were good, I really like their in-house sauce selection and the taste was good. However, as was the theme of the night, the ribs were overcooked/dry and didn't fall off the bone like other places would serve them. The dryness of the food made it tough to determine how good it all could've been."}
{"text":"Good meal Ordered the $99 combo and shared it with 5 people. We're all stuffed and still have some leftovers.  The pulled pork and ribs are amazing. The bbq chicken is just normal, nothing special. The lamb is so good  Good service & good food, what more can I say"}
{"text":"We ordered on uber eats the sampler platter for two. Food came quite cold. Description said two pieces of fried chicken, but it was rather one drums stick and two tiny nuggets (didn't even know what part of the chicken it was... just tiny slices of thigh?) The sauces on the ribs were good. Fries were delicious and the wings were amazing too. Overall we enjoyed and would have it again, next time eat in because it needs to be hotter."}
{"text":"Great ambience and service but honestly, the food is overrated.  The ribs were kinda dry and the wings weren't very tasty.  I like their popcorn though! Sides are decent but not worthy of all the hype around this place.  There is better barbecue to be had elsewhere."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of barbeque and finding Barque Smokehouse was from word of mouth!  My friend first recommended me to order from them at JustEat but i really wanted to go there and have it as fresh as possible.  She was super happy to have popped by Barque cherry.  I loved the look and feel of the place and it's always nice having a little bucket of popcorn to welcome me before my meal!  We ordered a sampler that game with 3 kinds of meats and 3 side dishes.  I loved their brisket and pulled pork!  they have this smoked pasta dish that i had to order two of too.  I am also glad that we made a reservation as the place isn't too big so it gets packed really fast!"}
{"text":"We visited for dinner. My Roncy pal raves about the brunch. First off, I really have to commend their staff for their professionalism and doing the utmost to give us the best experience possible. Knowing how busy they typically get for dinner, especially on a Friday night, I called ahead and made a reservation. Despite being late, they not only held my reservation but also saved me a seat on the patio, removed from all the racket of inside. My friend who has a few years of food service management under her belt was very impressed with the way their staff handled everything under pressure. So full marks for service. Bonus points for the bucket of seasoned popcorn ready at the table.   I had a Half a rack of Sweet Heat Baby Back Ribs with sides of  Squash & Brussel Sprouts and Creamy Smoked Cauliflower. The sides came in little cast iron skillets. The ribs were so perfectly succulent with such a well-balanced flavour profile and a great wood smoke undertone. My only disappointment was not ordering the Full Rack. Every table has a brush used for rubbing on two of their signature sauces. I didn't think the ribs needed anything extra.   My friend had the Pan-Seared Pacific Halibut with a smoked paprika emulsion and candied sweet potato. The plate had a beautiful presentation. She said it was a tad under seasoned but generally well done. She also ordered a Homemade Pecan Pie with Cinnamon Gelato, which couldn't possibly be bad.   I would say, going by the food alone, Barque is the best smokehouse in Toronto."}
{"text":"Took 30 minutes to get our food - not the speed you should have with barbecue, where the food is smoked and roasted in advance. Been to plenty great barbecue places in New York and MA, usually 10 minutes is a long wait - this was triple that. Brisket was tough and dry, and they waited 25 minutes to tell us they were out of fried chicken (2 hours after open).  Set your expectations low. Expensive, bad food, poor service."}
{"text":"[Good] BBQ - Ribs, wings, pulled pork...all great here!  Flavours are unique and and bold.  The sauce on the ribs were sticky and had a grainy texture which is different from your typical run of the mill watery BBQ sauce.  Pulled pork came with some grainy mustard that meshed very well.  Water - A very random thing to appreciate I know.  Waitress asked for still or sparkling when we sat down and being the Asian that I am, I instinctively asked for tap.  I've been burned too many times ordering a $10 bottle of water.  Without judgement, she comes back with both a jug each of still and sparkling and said it's complementary.  Popcorn - Chow down on some free popcorn while you mull over your BBQ options!  [Neutral] Lunch portions - A little on the small side than what I'd expect for BBQ but I guess it's lunch so it's reasonable.  [Worth it?] Anytime you get good BBQ up here in the north it's worth it.  It's a little far for a Markham dweller but I can say it's worth the trek.  Make sure you make reservations for dinner.  The first time I came and walked in, it was for dinner years ago and we waited until 10pm for a table of 6.  They fed us popcorn while we waited so that was nice.  I will return whenever I can."}
{"text":"I love Barque. I only wish it wasnt so full and packed all the time. We had to order takeout. But hey it was worth the drive to roncessvalle and just like they instructed.. we reheated the food in our oven for 30 minutes and it was SOOO good. We had a sampler for 2 with pork ribs, beef of some sort and our sides were fries, kick ass kale and an awesome cesar salad. The food tastes fresh. The meat was juicy and succulent. We litteralyl chowed down like carnivores.   The only thing... i feel like we coulda had more! Maybe we were just overlly hungry but i wanted another rack of ribs when I was done.  I cant wait to come back and try this place for actual sit-in dining. MMMMM yummy meat!"}
{"text":"Tried this place recently. Really good, professional, attentive and flamboyant wait staff - this is a positive thing!   Food was excellent. You can really taste the smoke. Cauliflower side dish was quite good - I cannot express how smoky it was. Good flavors in the meat. Dry rub was good. I had barbecue in South Carolina and North Carolina and so I would say this is a hipster version of barbecue. Would recommend. It is a bit priced but I would recommend the sampler plate for two - this should be enough food for you and a special somebody. You also get free popcorn. But make sure you eat it all because they took mine away before I had the chance to reach the bottom. I think the price is very fair for the quality that you are getting. I have no complaints.   Free parking on Geoffery street. Can get busy so make reservations or come after work. I notice most people now a days don't work and so they venture out for dinner at around 7-9 so arrive before and you should be able to get a seat."}
{"text":"A nasty waiting list followed by intense meat sweats and cooled off by good drinks served by a cute bartender... also free popcorn!"}
{"text":"I am officially obsessed with this place. I made reservations on Boxing Day for me and my family. I had to brow beat my mom a bit. She didn't want to go because she \"doesn't like bbq sauce\" lol but we all loved our food.   The Food: I had the famous smoked duck pancakes and they were sensational. I NEVER order pancakes but the photos lured me in. Moist fluffy cakes topped with tender and moist duck and a yummy fruit compote. The best. Mom had the standard breakfast which is a little pricey, but that is offset by the portion size. She is super picky about her breakfast (my partner always jokes he can't go to brunch with us because he dies of embarrassment when my mom or I send things back) no complaints here! Partner had the breakfast poutine which was also delicious.   The Service: Really attentive! The ladies working there are lovely, friendly, and chatty.   Atmosphere: a little loud but who cares!   We came back a few weeks later and had an equally excellent experience.   What this place teaches me about myself: Roncesvalle: Where have you been all my life?"}
{"text":"Barque may be the only barbecue place worth eating at in the GTA.  For some reason, real brisket is difficult to find in Toronto, and not only does Barque have it, they do it marvelously well.  Having done some travel in Texas I get massive cravings for barbecued beef brisket, and Barque is the only solution.  I could tell you the ribs are great (both the pork and the beef, the latter stunningly tender), or which sides are amazing (the Cuban corn, the caesar salad), or how cute it is that they offer you a little bucket of spiced-up popcorn the moment you sit down (it's real cute - no, you're not out of line if you want to dip it into your barbecue sauce).  They have a nice selection of whisky, too.  But honestly, please just come here and order the brisket.  It's outstanding, and the single best example of barbecue in the city.  It's tragic they stick to a sandwich menu at lunch, because I don't think anyone comes here wanting anything but a giant plate of meat.    Service has always been solid.  Honestly, they could whip my shins and buttocks with reeds on the way in and I wouldn't care, because that brisket is so freaking good.  I love The Stockyards, and their smoked pork ribs are very good, but in my opinion Barque's are better.  I go to Stockyards for fried chicken, and Barque for brisket.  As for Electric Mud, it doesn't hold a candle to this place.    If you want barbecue, and you're in Toronto, this is your only option."}
{"text":"I finally made it to Barque Smokehouse for their lunch specials!   What's better after having a hike and getting lost in High Park and then come here and feast on some meat?!  We ordered Pulled Pork with Arugula Salad ($12) and Beef Brisket with Cuban corn ($12). Both are smokin good!! I think is the combination of the meat and the sourness / spiciness of the toppings that makes the sandwiches so outstanding! And even their Arugula Salad is nicely done!   Just love the deco and set up of Barque too! I hope one day I can try their \"Sunday Family Night\" here! Maybe I can adopt some of the yelpers as my siblings?"}
{"text":"Since having moved to the Roncohood, I walk by Barque and am always deeply tempted by the unreal BBQ smells wafting around.  Finally I sauntered in for brunch with some friends.  I got brisket eggs benny on cornbread and it was delicious!  The meat was super moist, and the dish came with some really good, really crispy potato pancakes. My friends' meals looked just as good, and their French fries are salty and seasoned incredibly well.  It's always busy, so I didn't expect overwhelming service.  The only thing I can complain about was that even during the brunch rush, our food was uncommonly slow to come out but I think it was likely just an anomaly.  Brunch was definitely just the first stage of exploration at Barque."}
{"text":"Barque Smokehouse brings a true Southern smoked meat house right into the heart of Toronto's west end. This is a place that warrants return trips in order to enjoy all that they have to offer. The sampler platter is a great way to start for your first visit, to help you discover your favourite cuts and seasonings.   Great service, a lively atmosphere and a prototypical west end decor make Barque one of the barbecue places in town. The prices are nothing to scoff at but the food and experience is well worth the price. There are a lot of great hole in the wall type smokehouses hidden around the city, but it's not hard to see why Barque is a popular spot.   Make sure to make a reservation in advance as this place is very busy. I will definitely be back some time!"}
{"text":"a neighborhood go to for us...maybe its the addiction to the complimentary spice dusted popcorn.  The menu is easy to navigate and delicious.  Love the brisket and the wings are a must try.  The potato salad option during lunch has a light flavour and one of our favourite sides,  Ofcourse there are the ribs, but I'm impartial to the brisket and even have it with a bit of their mustard based bbq sauce on occasion.    Definitely call ahead if you can to reserve a table or you  might be in for a wait.  Lots of street parking  around and with Butcher bar just a few doors down, don't forget you can try that location that carries many of the same menu items!"}
{"text":"I've been here 5 times. After the first time, I returned 2 days later! Each time I ordered the platter for 2. Dry rub ribs, brisket, chicken thighs with 2 fries and pickled vegetables. Just a great meal! They are not receiving a 5 star rating, due to the fact that I came once right at 5pm and some of the meat was dry, almost as if it was left over from lunch?"}
{"text":"OMG Seriously!!   Just absolutely spectacular!   I've never had better.   The brisket, the pulled pork,  the chicken wings,  the baby backs.   Awesome!   And the collard greens were fantastic,  I've never had them before.... They were beautiful!   I had the special plate.   Great price, for $35 you get a salad,  an app, and a whole lot of meat and veggies for a main.   Awesome and a great way to try their meat!   And the red velvet cake in a jar?  Omg again!  To die for!   And did you know that they give you free sparkling or flat water?   And the servers were all terrific... I had a great looking 20ish year old guy... Yummy!   All in all, I'm afraid I might live here!"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue so let me just say that while I am late to the review party, I am by no means rusty in my Barque.   I can't even say I've ever had a bad meal. I've had to stop eating the popcorn because I ruin my appetite. The chicken, pork, beef - is all beautiful. I order one of those platters to share with my date and we always walk away happy.   I'll add more to this later - it's just about time I got something published now."}
{"text":"First things first: Barque is pronounced 'bark.' Think dogs, trees, or tri-masted sailing vessels. It's not 'bar-kew' (like barbeque missing a syllable), though either way it doesn't matter. Your mouth will be too full of juicy meatstuffs to care about simple things like pronunciation.  Barque's warm and inviting decor was a stark and pleasant contrast to the wet, grey evening upon which we arrived. It's bright and bubbling with noise inside, and there is wood everywhere. (Like, there was literally a pile of logs on a nearby shelf.) We sat down at a long table near the back of the house, and were welcomed with two pails of seasoned popcorn resting on the table top.  There are a selection of appetizers under $10, a pair of salads (Caesar and spinach), and eight solid-looking sides. Cutting to the chase: I'd recommend one of the samplers as the path of meat resistance. For $20 you pick three from four meaty options and get two sides. For $36 you get a higher quantity of meat (still three of four) and three sides.   I opted for the roast chicken thigh, Kansas-style baby-back ribs, and the brisket. Those are in ascending order of yum and yum they all were. Chicken was cooked perfectly but not too much else to say. The ribs are not of the fall-off-the-bone variety, and this works in their favour. Great texture and flavour without being slimy. The brisket came as super tender and mouth-watering slices. I'd love to try this on a bun or jump into a bathtub full of it. That good. My Caesar Salad was topped with candied bacon (GOOD) though I would have preferred more dressing. The Cuban Corn is 1/3 of a cob; it was a nice touch but next time I'm trying the pickled platter.   Service was pleasant, though I think our waitress was just learning the ropes. She had to ask who ordered what, which led to a confusing debacle at the table. That's an easy one to fix.  Chef and co-owner David Neinstein stopped by after to see how the meal was. He wasn't just fishing for compliments either, he really wanted to know what we thought and seemed determined to get things perfect. I gotta respect anyone who seeks feedback like that. Classy dude.  Great prices, a hospitable atmosphere, and a respectable showing for my first time out. After I recover from the meat sweats, I shall return.  Obligatory Title Pun: BARQUE's has got bite.  Menu Readability: Decent layout for something that appears to have been made in Word. Sampler section could be more intuitive.  Need to mention: They 'make' their own water here.  What this place teaches me about myself: Man cannot live on bread alone, but BBQ? Possibly."}
{"text":"Three letters: WOW. I love barbecue, and these guys knows how to make the good stuff. And I never thought one could make a upscale barbecue restaurant without it being tacky, but these guys succeeded in doing so.  Everything is executed so perfectly. The meat is delicious, moist and tender. And the sides are out of this world.  The seasoned popcorn served just right as we sat down was a nice bonus touch. Sounds weird, but it was perfect!  Really, I love my experience there and I will go back without any second thoughts next time I'm in Toronto.  If you like meat, go there. Don't overthink it. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"This Roncey staple has been a place that I was hoping to try for a long time. I haven't been to a Southern BBQ restaurant in Toronto before aside from chains (Montana's, I'm looking at you.).   Firstly, I don't believe they take reservations on weekends during dinner time on OpenTable so I expected a wait in any case. We arrived around 7:30 on a Saturday and were told that it would be 1 hour. We strolled around and grabbed an ice cream at Eds Real Scoop. After 30 minutes, we were pleasantly surprised with a phone call stating that we had a table on the patio.   We were greeted with the nicest waitress (we tipped 20% just because she was so nice!). She told us about how everything worked, gave me a great beer recommendation (Belle Gueule Lager for the summer night). The patio had a great ambiance to it with lights hung around, which would make for a cute date place. We had complementary BBQ flavoured popcorn that was waiting for us. It was a nice snack, pretty flavourful in certain sections - while a little bland in places with less flavouring. A cute gesture nonetheless.   We decided to start with their sweet heat wings and a small arugula/tangerine salad. Their wings were really good - flavourful with a small kick and tender meat. One of my favourites of the night. Salad was good - nothing too fancy, exactly as it sounds topped with a vinaigrette. Given this is a meal of all meats, it was a welcomed starter.   In terms of our main, we ordered a half rack of ribs (their classic sauce), 7oz of brisket and 7oz of pulled pork. It came with a honey mustard and BBQ sauce on the side to spread our meats with (with a brush). The brisket and the pulled pork were good - BBQed pretty well but definitely needed the sauces to give it that extra kick. The ribs were very well seasoned, I expected it to fall off the bone but it was a little less tender than that. However it was still delicious. It was more than enough for the two of us for dinner - we probably could have gotten the smaller servings of pulled pork and brisket.   Overall, I'd recommend the wings the most. The rest are staples to southern BBQ and it's worth trying. Barques does what it does well - but after a while it was definitely a whole lot of meat to handle. It was kind of the same taste over and over. The bill came out to $70 for two people (including a beer). It was a reasonable meal for the amount of food that we got.   If you would like a restaurant with a great atmosphere and serving great Southern BBQ, this would be a great place. Really good to bring a big group or come here as a date. Roncey also is just such a cute neighbourhood to stroll around in before or after your meal."}
{"text":"Go there when you are hungry.Order one of daily menu...! Nice to have kind of places in TORONTO."}
{"text":"Ok. I love the food but I'm seriously tired if being turned away for random special events. You guys should figure out how to account for locals."}
{"text":"There has been a lot of hype around Barque Smokehouse recently, and reviews have been overwhelmingly positive. Upon arrival, I wasn't entirely surprised to be told that the wait was going to be two and a half hours long. I had to eat a piece of cheesecake from a nearby Timothy's to tie me over.   About an hour and a half later, I got a call telling me that there were 2 seats available at the bar. As it turned out, these \"bar\" seats were actually set up at the counter where I presume people wait for take-out orders. Instead of facing the bar, we were staring right into the kitchen, which I wasn't very happy about. Had I known, I would've just waited longer for more decent seats.   We munched on BBQ flavoured popcorn while studying the menu. For the barbeque sampler for two, we chose competition chicken thigh, half a rack of spicy baby back ribs and the brisket. I think Barque has done a very good job nailing the flavours, but the textures could be improved. The ribs were a little tough for my liking, and I've had more tender chicken thighs before. The part that I enjoyed the most was the fatty part of the brisket. I guess my preference for slow-cooked meat is to be melt-in-your-mouth. That said, the BBQ flavours were wonderful (although I couldn't detect much heat from the \"spicy\" baby back ribs).  For sides, we got two Barque Caesar salads and a spinach and cheese ravioli. The salad was under-dressed, although the candied bacon was a pleasant addition. The spinach and cheese ravioli would've been delicious had it been hot enough. In fact, my first ravioli was still cold in the center.   In the end, I felt slightly underwhelmed by the meal. Because of all the hype, my expectations were really high, and unfortunately, there were just too many flaws for me to really love this place. The food didn't blow my mind away like I thought it would."}
{"text":"Whew! I thought I would be the only one giving this place 3-stars!  Ordered the sampler for 2 - the brisket was really nice and tender but taste was overall bland, the chicken thighs were odd and also bland, the ribs were fall off the bone and tasty but I recommend using the hot sauce for all three to get a bit of flavour. The cauliflower side were pretty tasty, except the \"creamy\" sauce was more watery. The brussel sprouts & squash was undercooked; I couldn't even stick my fork into the sprouts! Majority of our food came out cold/room temperature.   Service was pretty good; very attentive and friendly.  We only told them of our cold food after so they comped our beers.   Ummm....probably will not come back though."}
{"text":"Walking into this place provides an infusion of amazing barbeque smells to your nose that you will not forget.   If I had to describe the food here in two words I would say that it was: Really Really Good (that's right, that IS two words).  I got here a little late so my two other friends had already ordered some appetizers.  The name of what they ordered I don' t know but I was greeted with a beef-stuffed ravioli bathed in a really flavourful sauce.  I tried the Sampler for One, which includes a choice of three proteins and 2 sides.  I went for the Brisket, the Beef Rib, and the 1/3 Rack of Baby Back Ribs, with a side of gnocchi and fries (yes, very healthy).  The gnocchi was recommended by our server who was very friendly and helpful.    My friend was uncertain on what to get for an entree and when he mentioned that to our waiter he responded without hesitation or time delay - \"You want the Smoked Beef Tenderloin\" - which he did not end up getting, but was a very definite suggestion!  The atmosphere was great at this place although I found sitting on the inside side of the booth a little loungier than I would want.  The place is well illuminated and the smells inside are a treat to your senses.  The food came quickly and at the right temperature (things don't come burning lava hot as some other places).    Between all that I ate I could have probably given up the Beef Rib to try the Chicken instead (maybe next time!).  The beef rib actually did not have much meat on it... The brisket and baby back ribs were delicious, especially when you brush the sauces that they provide (together with a personal brush) on the meats!  The bill was reasonable for the quality and quantity of food obtained.  I definitely look forward to going to this place again and having a great dinner with my lovely girlfriend.   Great place, awesome ambience, delicious food!"}
{"text":"Since so many have reviewed at great length, I'll keep it short and simple: I'll be back for the dry-rubbed pork ribs. They were great.   Unfortunately, not much else hit it out of the park. The caesar salad wasn't bad, but needed lemon desperately - and servers are few and far between here, though both nice and hard-working. The cuban corn was just a charred corn cob with a rather tasteless and messy sauce smeared on it. The beef ribs weren't all that, and the brisket was less enjoyable again.  Reasonable value; almost acceptable service. But go for the pork ribs - they alone move this review from 2 to 3 stars."}
{"text":"I've been to Barque Smoke House several times.  Each time the service was super.  The servers took the time to explain the specials and answer any of the questions I had.    The ambiances is modern, my one complaint is that in certain spots the tables are almost to close together.  This is the place you definitely need a reservation for and I usually call to reserve for dinner about a month in advance.  I have tried the dinner sampler for two having the brisket, beef ribs, and the short ribs, the prized chicken thigh was also an option but the other options were more to my liking.  The beef rib was mouth watering.  The sauce they used really suited the meat and it wasn't hard to eat, although I wouldn't call it fall off the bone it was maybe on step above that.  The short ribs were a little tougher but the taste was good.  They also picked a sauce that suited them as well.  The brisket is also quiet good but brisket is not generally a meat I enjoy but the way they did it was still very good.  As the sides we picked the french fries I didn't necessarily enjoy them as they had a nutmeg taste to them although done well I'm sure others have enjoyed them, also had the sprouts which had a buttery sauce to them and the pickled platter that included different pickled veggies and I love anything that is pickled.  To end that meal I had the home made pie I can't remember the type but it had almonds in it and I did enjoy it, and it came with ice cream.  On another occasion I had the pulled duck taco's, wings, and poutine all of those were wonderful.  Each one was an appetizer and I really enjoyed them all.  The poutine came in a cast Iron pan which was kind of cute as it was really small and those fries did not taste like nutmeg but perhaps because they had gravy and brisket all over them and the sauce they used was divine.    Breakfast at Barque is very plea sent I've tried the savoury pancakes with pulled duck and blueberry compote and all I can say is it sounds like a weird combination but they really compliment each other.  I have also had the eggs Benedict.  They have their own rendition of a BBQ hollindaise sauce and use brisket instead of the usual Canadian bacon, it was very good.  As for drinks they don't disappoint with their fresh squeeze lemonade and the Caesars are to die for with the candied bacon rimming them.  Still water or sparkling water is available for free and at your leisure.    Each time I've been to Barque I have enjoyed it."}
{"text":"My partner and I go here at least once a month. It is so far for us. Best ribs, brisket, wings and fries ever!!! Soooo good!!! So ridiculous to get a table too so we usually get takeout. I want their secret for making those ridiculously amazing fries."}
{"text":"Very average food, good atmosphere and service. It's worth trying once but you probably won't feel the need to go back.  Look elsewhere if you're looking for proper BBQ."}
{"text":"Always very busy but worth the wait.   They have amazing dry rub wings. The ribs were also good but the wings stands out the most.  They make their Caesars with a candied bacon rim and pickled asparagus. Get it extra spicy! Bomb!  Definitely go back."}
{"text":"So I finally had the pleasure of having brunch at Barque. As per my previous review, this experience did not disapoint. My partner and I both got the Barque Benny. It comes on a piece of cornbread with brisket instead of an english muffin and back bacon.  So we were the first ones in there on Sunday morning. We tried to go on Saturday around 9:30am but they didn't open until 10:30. Needless to say we weren't going to make the same mistake twice. We got to sit on the patio and enjoy the morning sun with our coffee.  The food came out in good time. My only complaint about the whole thing is the corn bread could have been a bit thicker. The brisket was as it always is: tender with good smoke penetration and enough fat to keep it moist. The eggs were perfectly cooked with enough runny yolk to ooze out over everythign and mix with the standard benedict hollondaise sauce.   The barque potatoes are awesome. My pet peeve is when homefries are of unequal size and the smaller pieces are crispy and the bigger pieces are too starchy and undercooked. All the potatoes were nicely crispy and covered in the same rub that the meat gets slathered in prior to smoking. Delicious.  It came with some nice fruit and an arugala salad with fennel bulb sliced nice and thing and orange wedges. I like that the salad came in its own bowl so as not to get all wilted from the heat of the hot food.  The bill came to about 40 bucks for two with coffee which isn't too bad a price for brunch in this city."}
{"text":"I've been to Barque a couple of times for dinner but this review will reflect the brunch. Had brunch on a Saturday and was glad to make reservations online as I would expect the place to be busy busy on a weekend (which was the case as there were several large parties).  Service was prompt and the waitress was great but our food took a while to get to the table (around 25-30 minutes or so). My boyfriend ordered the smoked duck pancakes and I got the Barque benedict with brisket. The smoked duck pancakes were huge and delicious; the smoked duck added a savory component to the dish which really complemented the sweetness of the maple syrup and the blueberries. The benedict was good as well, but it would have been better if there were more brisket on the dish (I had around 3-4 slices). The star of the benedict was not the brisket but surprisingly the cornbread. Just thinking about it I would be able to eat the cornbread on it's own. The salad that was paired with the benedict was a nice touch as I got my greens/veggies.  Brunch was decent but I would come back for the bbq for dinner."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner today with friends. We ordered the platter. When the platter arrived everything was cold. The desert had no flavour. We were rushed with the bill as there were people to be seated. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"My  friends and I visit Barque on Tuesday Jun 9th. We wait 30 minutes to get a table for party of 5. The design is very rustic and it has a small patio. The service is fine and efficient and you can find a small bucket of cinnamon popcorn on the table. Two of us ordered combination for two which allows you to choose 3 choices of meats and 3 choices of sides. The meats are seasoned while the portions are small. They also carry three different Montreal draft beers. Overall is fine but a bit expensive considering the portion size. It is not bad for trying it once however we may not go back again."}
{"text":"So i come here on a Friday night for dinner with a group of 6 people, and they are pretty much packed for some reason, i don't know whats so special about this place, food was mediocre service was nothing special, and at the end of my meal  the server asks for a tip!! Seriously ? I was in shock when that happened, i simply walked out and i did not say a word, shame on you people."}
{"text":"My girlfriend took me here for my birthday in the summer.  It has a really cool set-up.  The wait staff was very friendly and explained how everything works and how we were supposed to order.  We decided to share a platter with a bit of everything (meat and grilled veggies); she had a house Caesar that was rimmed with bacon bits and I had a beer. The atmosphere was great and the food was delicious.    The only negative thing was the amount of fruit flies that were out in full force.  It was a cavalry, nay, an army."}
