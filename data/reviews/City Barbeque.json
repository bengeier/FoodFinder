{"text":"I came here based on recommendations from yelp. The food was good. I am from Texas so our bbq is on a different level (the way it is prepared), so I wasn't looking to compare,  just to have some bbq fir the 4th of July. The ribs were tender, but not very flavorful. The chicken was moist with a hint of smoke in the taste. The beans were the best part of the meal. Again, the food was good,  but not great."}
{"text":"We do online orders for our group gatherings of 6 to 8 people, and usually order meats by the pound.. Matthew C. at the online order check-out, is the best person to help with suggestions ..   like how much to order for a party size, which package is most suitable, what the sauces are like etc. Each time we go to pick up our orders, we are so thankful that he is there to help. Thanks Matt, you're the best !  And yes.. the beef brisket and pulled pork are always a big hit at every one of our different group meetings... tender, succulent and oh so delicious !"}
{"text":"I relocated to Charlotte about 4 yrs ago. City BBQ is right up the road from me. Sunday I had a taste for BBQ and potato salad. Ordered BBQ chicken, greens and potato salad. The best potato salad I've ever had any so good, greens flavorful, chicken moist, cooked just right and the sauce added  a zing.  The banana pudding is signature to City BBQ. I was in culinary heaven, Staff is friendly and helpful with 1st timers. I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I was staying in the area and looking for a nearby place to eat. I discovered City Barbecue and decided to give it a try. Well for a place that has only been open a week, they sure are on their game! Super friendly staff that make sure you are at home and satisfied. The meats ( I had the brisket and pulled pork) were fantastic, smoky without being over done. The green beans and collards were perfect, and the portions of everything were very generous. Will definitely return on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Best ribs in Charlotte! Great company, friendly employees and they give back to community as well. Can't wait to try the brisket.  The Lo Lo pork is as good as any Eastern BBQ I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"Where should I even start with this place? I love bbq, but this place was a total disappointment. 

1. OVERPRICED
It was overpriced for what you received. The sides are NOT included with any of the main plates, but the guy who took our order at the counter asked us what 2 sides we wanted. When I asked if they were included, he said ' you add them on for extra $$'. They were giving away corn pudding samples. I had never heard of corn pudding and it didn't look or sound appetizing so we passed on the sample We spent over $50 for the 2 of us as we planned to take some home, but threw more than half of it away there. STATUS: annoyed before we even have any food.

2. LAYOUT & LOGISTICS
They call out your name when the food is ready and you go up and pick it up at the counter. When I ordered, the guy asked for my name but then didn't record it in the register since the girl just started yelling out 'one turkey breast, ribs....'. Five minutes passed before I even realized it was me so my food was cold by the time I got it. The place is bad feng shui because someone bumped into when I got my food, another person bumped into me when I got sauce, and another person bumped into me when I got napkins. Since there were 2 of us, we sat at a 2 person table. However, the metal trays they put your food on are wider than the table. No one wants to sit at a table wondering if in one false move their food will fall on the floor. STATUS: more annoyed.

3. BURNT & FATTY FOOD
My ribs were overcooked, burnt, and dried out. The brisket had a huge chunk of fat in it. Gross. (see pic) I ate about 1/3 of it and threw the rest away, but not before having someone bump into me at the trash can. See point 2 above on layout. The texas toast was some kind of sad empty hot dog roll. The family who were sitting next to us said they brought a coupon and the order taker didn't apply it. Grrr.. 

FINAL THOUGHTS
There are so many bbq joints in Charlotte so I'm not coming back to this place. Ever."}
{"text":"Driving through from Charlotte to Virginia Tech..  great food, reasonably priced.  Fried Okra and the Corn Pudding are the best."}
{"text":"I hesitated writing a review because this is my best kept secret. I love the fact that this place is consistent! The food is always great, they have some pretty awesome folks working here and although because they cook everything fresh I've hadv to wait for a side to come out the kitchen, l don't mind. 
This place is crazy busy on weekends, but well worth the wait!
Robbie and the other employees keep us coming back!
Ribs, corn pudding, greens and sweet tea never fail me!"}
{"text":"LOVED this place!  Came to Charlotte from Canada for 10 days and we are here twice! Great menu with loads of choices. I think we tried it all!  Must have the ribs!!!  So good. Staff was friendly, fast and welcoming. If you are craving BBQ, this place won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Had a great first trip here. Brisket was fantastic.

Second trip, not so great. 

I got the pulled chicken- it came with a weird mayo based sauce, not what I was expecting.

Then they announced that they were out of two sides, one being macaroni and cheese (how are you out of that on a Friday night?) One family left because of this.

We then wanted to order banana pudding and were told that they were out of the dessert size but that it came in a pint size (?) Okay....?

We will be back but hopefully this was a fluke thing!"}
{"text":"Finally a good BBQ place in the University City area! Went for my hubby's b-day. A trainer from Ohio I believe took our order, and was sooo sweet! She gave me a free drink, and two slices of cake for the hubbs b-day! She even checked in on us later! Southern raised so I know my BBQ. While it may not be Skylight Inn (The best bbq ever), it's really good! Brisket sandwich was moist, and love how you can pick your own sauces from the sauce bar! I had mac and cheese and it was good! Not too salty, and nice and saucy. Hubbs had the corn pudding, we both loved it! His pork was a little dry though, the only con. Tea was up to par, and the chocolate cake was amazing! Not too sweet, and super moist. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"AWESOME BBQ !! Tonight was our third visit to City BBQ  it is a great BBQ restaurant !  we have ordered the Judge's sampler twice and it is amazing if you want a taste of some of their different meats this is the one to get . The pulled pork and brisket is moist and full of flavor the ribs are my favorite moist and the flavor is amazing and falls off the bone !! We also tried their mixed greens with pork side  tonight this southern girl gives it ten thumbs up they were so delicious !!! The service is great ! Restaurant is clean very friendly staff ."}
{"text":"Amazing will definitely eat here every time I'm in the area. Great service friendly people and amazing food!!!! Me and my wife split the city sampler had sausage, BBQ, Brisket and turkey and oh my it was all amazing. Some of the best I've ever had. Also comes with great Texas toast and two sides, we had green beans and baked beans both great."}
{"text":"We went out for dinner tonight, the pork sandwich was very good as were the turkey salad and side dishes. The ribs were really oily and greasy. They were right out off the grill. We brought them all home and let them sit for about an hour, and they were much better, not oily or greasy. 
Maybe they should let them sit for a few minutes before serving?"}
{"text":"Really great smokehouse, ask for extra bark!
Great sauce selection to mix it up, got a special blend of my own: Loco mustard and original. Favorite side is corn pudding, of course 
And the folks are real nice, chat Andrew up at the serving counter next time!"}
{"text":"Friends of ours had recommended City BBQ to us a few months ago and we finally went Friday night.  Cannot say enough about how much we enjoyed the food and experience.

We were immediately treated by a friendly, and happy, woman behind the cash register, ready to take our order.  I say this because over the past few months we have been accustomed to the opposite at many other restaurants.  We ordered pull pork sandwich with two sides and pulled chicken with two sides.  Both the pork and chicken were moist and tasty.  Sides were potato salad, slaw, salad, and hush puppies.  The slaw was especially good.  A very comfortable and friendly atmosphere, well worth our time and money.  Great job!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pound of brisket to go late this afternoon. I have to say it was some of the best smoked brisket I've ever had, and I have sampled many places around the country. Staff very friendly and fast. Even though this restaurant is quite a bit further away from what has been my regular favorite place, I'll be going back to City BBQ in Matthews. Thanks and keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I bought a smoker because of them.

When they first opened they constantly ran out of ribs.  I was flustered so I bought a smoker to make my own.  Eventually they were able to keep up with the traffic and I tried their food.

Plenty of food for a good price.  Staff is energetic and the food isn't bad.  They have their own style which is a good variety amongst the other bbq joints. Some days the food is better than others but it's constantly tasty.  A big plus is the wide variety of sauces to choose from. You'll also get a wide pick of smoked meat from ribs, sausauges, chicken, brisket, pulled pork and side dishes. Recommended."}
{"text":"Great customer service from the general manager, David. He went above and beyond to make sure we were satisfied with our meal."}
{"text":"The smell gets you as soon as you step in the front door.  The staff is very friendly and helpful in navigating the menu and explaining the options.  Brisket, collard greens, mac & cheese were all FANTASTIC!  I'm not a big bread fan, but the Texas toast sandwich was a great option on this visit."}
{"text":"Not a bad barbecue joint. I ordered the brisket sandwich and it was alright. The food was nothing to write home about, but the people were nice and it was obvious that they kept their restaurant with care. Not dirty at all and the decor was very intentional - and good looking.

Thanks,"}
{"text":"I have visited here twice. The first visit the food was really good. I'm a big fan of BBQ and I'm glad this is close by to where I live. The 2nd visit was not as good. The food was served hot but everything was very salty. The French fries and baked beans had way too much salt. The prices are pretty high as well in  relation to the portion sizes. I would have given 4 stars but the combination of the sodium content and prices were a bit disappointing."}
{"text":"Always up to try a new bbq spot and how else to first try it in the south than with a pound of pulled pork and a vinegar based bbq sauce? Great smoky flavor, perfect char, and the swine wine bbq sauce was one of the better ive ever had. They should be proud. Great job!"}
{"text":"This location just  opened in the University City area and it is very well located for the family as it near the small lake. Great place to bring the family.  We shared a city sampler my two kids and my husband and it was delicious and plenty.  My daughter couldn't stop eating the brisket."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in charlotte. Favorite sides are the baked beans and collards. Fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"We had be wanting to try city BBQ and we finally did. If they want to survive in the future they have work to do. The person who takes your order was not very friendly nor did he give the proper attention to the customer. While taking our order he was having a side conversation with someone else. The restaurant was dirty, they have bottles of sauce on every table in squeeze bottles that are transparent however they clearly do not clean the bottles, there was dried old sauce on the tops and in the tip were the sauce comes out. They have a fixing bar also with sauce and it is not very clean either burnt sauce caked in the open containers. See my pictures..... the food was not hot at all. You would expect being a new restaurant that it would be very clean but that's not the case at all. Very disappointing!!!"}
{"text":"Service was truly excellent! We came in to celebrate my birthday and the Management wished me well. As for the food....the pulled pork is truly exceptional. Wonderful service, good sized portions, and a feel-good environment!"}
{"text":"The BBQ is tasty. The sides are savory and not sweetened, like a lot of places now. You order at a counter and then sit and wait for your name to be called, which takes very little time. They have a few beers, lemonade, tea, soft drinks, etc."}
{"text":"Grand opening day is understandably chaotic. However, there were some definite hits and misses.

First up, the hits:

The brisket is melt in your mouth, fork tender. No knife needed for this treat.  Great flavor that doesn't need sauce to detract from it!

The chicken is equally tender and flavorful. Definitely worth trying. 

The ribs are fabulous. Again, melt in your mouth tender. 

The cornbread would be a awesome compliment to a brisket chili when the weather cools off a bit more (hint! Hint!)

The banana pudding is a-ma-zing!  Tastes homemade and perfectly sweetened by the fresh bananas and caramel. 

Now for the misses...

The door to the patio is awkwardly placed.  On a busy day who wants to squeeze back and forth through the line to get drink refills, condiments, etc.  This could have been better thought out.

The texas toast was just okay.  Toasted bread, no real flavor.  Moving on...

The mac 'n cheese.   What can I say, I'm biased when it comes to mac 'n cheese.  The mac 'n cheese at Mac's Speed Shop is the gold standard by which all other mac 'n cheese is judged.  Sadly City Barbecue's version is nothing to write home about.  It's pasta and cheese sauce but that's about it.


Overall, we enjoyed our visit to City Barbecue and will probably come back. Next time we will try some other menu items like the sausage, turkey and some of the other side options.  The banana pudding will definitely be part if that visit, too."}
{"text":"My order was wrong and the girl argued with me about it. That's a bad way to get things started. It was also packed to go and by the time that got that straightened out it was all pretty cold.  Ribs were really good, meaty with a good rub, but being cold blew it. Pulled pork was very tasty on its own and not fatty. My favorite thing was ironically the chicken fingers. Nicely fried, great flavor. French fries and okra were very good too but stone cold. That just doesn't work. Collards were undercooked and awful. Green beans are the southern mushy style. Nice selection of sauces. Wish I could tell you about the hush puppies but none for us. The dining room was pretty dirty. Busy Saturday night needs someone in the dining room on clean up duty. Glad to see another restaurant on the Monroe corridor."}
{"text":"Great barbecue!! Love the brisket and ribs. The sides are very delicious too, had the baked beans (have brisket in them) and the corn pudding. They had a ton of side options so I'm looking forward to trying more. My husband had the \"more cowbell\" sandwich which he loved. They also have a side for fixins and keep their barbecue sauce warm which is a nice tough. Definitely would recommend for fast casual BBQ!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great vibes and fantastic service! They also give free samples of sides before you order definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Yuuuummy!!!! My fiancé and I both got pulled pork and it was delicious!!!! Mac n cheese could use a little salt and pepper, but it was still good! Hush puppies were on point! Cheese fries hit the spot!!! Cute interior, kind employees, and quick service!!! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Great beef briscket, but make sure your side items are correct on take out!! I seem to always get the wrong Cole slaw!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate there last night and it will be our last.  I ordered a half rack of ribs which were charred on top making it chewy and nearly inedible and not.very digestible.  Inside the meat was undercooked, fat with some gristle.  My wife's pulled pork sandwich had been cooked without any sauce and was tasteless.  Their sauces were either too hot, vinegary or too sugary and sweet.  The best sauce appeared to be similar to Bull's Eye.  This was a very disappointing meal.  My wife was raised in Shelby. home to Red Bridges Barbecue, probably the best in the area.  I am also familiar with Lexington Barbecue and City Barbecue is a very poor substitute. If I could have given it less than one star I would have.. Don't. waste your money !"}
{"text":"UPDATE

I've gone back to City BBQ several times, drawn by the excellent service and even better food. Some great brisket and fantastic pulled pork served by smiling, friendly employees all make for a great afternoon and evening. 


I only recently found out about City BBQ, a semi-recent import from Ohio of all places. I'll admit, I was a bit skeptical about the place. I mean, what does Ohio know about good barbeque? Apparently. . . quite a lot. 

This is some fantastic food. I've had the brisket and pulled pork, sausage, chicken, cornbread, mac and cheese, chocolate cake and 'nanna pudding. No, not all at once. I don't care how good the food is, there are limits to what I can ingest in a single sitting. I've been there twice. And both times I thought I'd finally had that long-prophesied heart attack and ended up in BBQ Heaven. 

Nope. Still alive and thank goodness. I get to go back to City BBQ again. Not only is the food tremendous, the staff there works overtime to make everyone in the place feel at home. I honestly marveled at how this restaurant seems to have stocked up on helpful, friendly, knowledgeable employees while I have been almost to the point of setting fire to myself in a bid to get the attention of my local grocery clerk. 

This is a fantastic addition to the local BBQ scene. I want more. It's well worth your time and money. Get there"}
{"text":"The brisket was all fat. The BBQ was just okay. The cornbread and pudding was gross. We won't be back."}
{"text":"First off, the BBQ is incredible and way better than I expected for a counter service style restaurant (this is like the Panera of BBQ places). But also the staff are incredible friendly. I came in fairly early, probably the first customer of the day, and I ordered something but it turned out the meat wasn't ready for another 15 min or so, and they offered me a free side while I wait. I honestly didn't care that I had to wait 15 minutes, I wasn't in a rush, so they were just being proactively nice about it. Genuinely good food and people. It's good when you're not in the mood to sit down at a place like midwood. It's my go-to \"BBQ for lunch\" spot."}
{"text":"First time I've ventured into City Barbecue while in CLT for work. I ordered the City Sampler and opted for the pulled chicken instead of turkey. The beef brisket was by far the best meat on my plate. Tender, smokey, and a handsome smoke ring surrounding a well earned bark made this the highlight of my meal. To further the beef affair, I had a small Brisket Chili Bowl and that too was a beautifully composed bite that I'd happily eat as a meal in itself. Their sausage was a home run and my second choice for meat on the plate. The hush puppies were excellent as well as both varieties of coleslaw. I didn't spend as much time enjoying the pork (a bit chewier than I liked with my recent dental work) and the chicken was tasty but not enough to distract my attention from the beef. 

Their Kansas City style sauces were decent but in my opinion the real star was their Piedmont Carolina sauce. Wow! That stuff had kick and flavor and was excellent on everything from the meat, corn bread, and hush puppies. 

The staff was extremely friendly in multiple interactions and made an out-of-towner feel very welcome. My new favorite Q place in Charlotte. Will definitely be back and recommend to coworkers."}
{"text":"Picking up the smoked turkey breast platter for thanksgiving dinner was one of the smartest things we've ever done. Huge hit with our family. Can't wait to repeat for Christmas. Thank you City Barbecue !"}
{"text":"Positives: corn pudding, Bourbon sauce, ginger sauce, atmosphere, tender turkey

Negatives: overpriced for a counter order restaurant, lukewarm food temperatures, sausage casings are too thick, City Sampler plate was small, Texas toast is a hamburger bun cut in half, mac and cheese tastes like it came from a box"}
{"text":"Samples of sides to help you decide! This bbq is for real and so many sauces to choose from! Baked beans are sooo good!"}
{"text":"Out of Chicken and greens on a Friday night at 6:30pm, really....
I will not go back. 
Pulled chicken full of yuck, yuck sauce. 
Good luck..."}
{"text":"Great for pick up, and definitely a better option than any of the nearby fast food. Really nice BBQ. I'd recommend their BBQ tacos or their sandwich with brisket. Definitely get the baked beans."}
{"text":"This is barely 2 stars for me. I am really not a very hard person to please, but I truly do not understand how this became a chain restaurant??? There are so many other BBQ places that are leaps and bounds above this food! Got the brisket which was really dry but the flavor was ok. Tasted like smoked meat. Not a big surprise. The side dishes were inedible. The Mac and Cheese tasted like styrofoam or melted plastic and looked about the same. I could not even eat more than 3 bites of it, it was making me sick to my stomach. I swear Stouffer's makes better Mac and Cheese and I hate that as well! Anyway, go try it for yourself. I would not want to dissuade anyway from at least going once, but my mind was blown at how bad it is. To top off the experience, the price is utterly ridiculous! I think my lunch came to $16!!! For something I could not even eat! Never going back! Moes BBQ in Matthews is soooo much better!!"}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of BBQ around town, and this is definitely up there as one of my favorites, by far."}
{"text":"I've been here three times now and the food seems to get worse with each visit. Last time I was there, I got the brisket which was dry like it had been sitting for awhile and the sides came out cold. Utensil and sauce area was dirty and they were out of the usual cups you put the sauce in. No one was bothering to call people's names when the food was ready either so that seemed confusing to a lot of people who were sitting down waiting for the food only to find out they had to go up and get it. Poor communication and service. What was once a place I thought was decent for BBQ has become a place that I will avoid in the future. For the price and all the self service that you do for yourself, I feel I'm better off going to a full service BBQ place as well."}
{"text":"Visited Wednesday, February 28, 2018. Ordered half slab with baked beans and green beans. In the middle of the night both of us had nausea and vomiting.."}
{"text":"We attended for the soft opening. Every single bite was delicious. I can never decide between the entrees and the sandwiches. The banana pudding is a must try! I highly recommend this new location. 

The setup is a order & pickup at the counter style with plenty of flexible seating. It has a nice, casual vibe. 

Service is quick and friendly. 

For the experience, I feel the prices are slightly higher than comparable places which took a star."}
{"text":"Love this location. ALWAYS have a great meal and efficient, friendly service. But today was above and beyond. We ordered four salads for delivery and two were wrong. Mistakes happen. So I drove there to fix it instead of making their driver come back out. They genuinely felt bad, promptly fixed my order no questions asked, and refused to let me pay for the additional item I ordered for all my troubles. Completely unnecessary but appreciated. I will most certainly be back. This is how customer service is done."}
{"text":"Excellent barbecue and great staff. I'm pretty picky about barbecue and this one is really good.  Best I ever had? Can't honestly say yes because it's impossible to compare different styles to each other.  St Louis, Georgia, Florida, even Mountain and Costal Carolina can't be compared. Apples & Oranges. 

Anyway, it's one of my two go-to barbecue restaurants in Charlotte. Best thing is that I've been to two different locations and both were excellent!"}
{"text":"I know that people can be really picky and snobby when it comes to barbecue, but these days I'm more of a \"did I enjoy it or not\" type of guy. I really enjoyed City Barbecue! I got some food delivered through door dash, so I can't speak to the restaurant experience, but the food was excellent and a very large portion. I made 2.5 big meals out of the two meat plate and a few sides.

The corn pudding was especially good as were the collard greens. The ribs were large, meaty, and not too greasy. The pulled pork was very moist and tasty as well.

I've eaten at a lot of barbecue restaurants in the area and left very disappointed, but I'm happy to say that this was not the case at City!"}
{"text":"With so many great BBQ options in Charlotte, you might try a chain like City Barbeque for convenience but the food and service are your standard fare, in my opinion.  

We brought a large (10 people) group in for lunch and it took quite awhile for them to complete our order.  I get the feeling they are still working out some kinks in their system.  

The food was solid for the most part, portion sizes were decent for the price.  I would probably go back if I'm in the area and have a taste for BBQ but not sure I'd go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets! Talk about a company that takes pride in the food they serve and serve it well! Everything is full of flavor with that hint of smokey goodness. They ensure their food is as fresh as possible and it makes all the difference. I'm a huge fan and can't wait to go back and bring more friends to try this gem!"}
{"text":"Tried City BBQ for the first time today. Overall experience was good. Opening weekend, so it was crowded, as we expected. My husband and I shared the Judge's Sampler, which was more than enough for the 2 of us. We even took some home with us. The highlights: brisket- very good, not too fatty and not too lean. Ribs- very tender and yummy. Cornbread- mmmm. Potato salad- I'm not a huge potato salad fan, but this one was tasty. Fried okra/ tasted very fresh and just lightly battered. Our platter also came with chicken- good, but nothing special. Pulled pork- was good, but a little on the dry side. Mac and cheese- also good, but not stand out. We also brought banana pudding home with us, I had high expectations and while the flavor was good, ours didn't have any vanilla wafers!! Didn't compare to my 2 favorites (Haberdish and Pinky's). That was disappointing. Overall, we had a good experience and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Great Place, Great Staff that gives back to the community can't thank them enough for supporting the Vance Cougar Football Team with delicious food!"}
{"text":"Great service at City BBQ. The prices of the food are great, too! Definitely recommend the hush puppies and the fries are too good! Definitely a great place for a quick lunch, too!"}
{"text":"Very Good Food... Nice Chicken and Awasome Banana Pudding.

Good Ambiance also . Just missed the spicy sauces"}
{"text":"I recently ordered party packs from City Barbecue to cater a birthday party. The ordering process was easy. All of the food was packaged well and in a way that kept everything hot. Our guests raves about how great the food was. The mac and cheese disappeared very quickly - highly recommend. The brisket was great too. City barbecue is a favorite in my family and always our go-to to feed a crowd!"}
{"text":"We were a party of 9 (5 were adults) and we each picked a different entree.  Everything was delicious and portion size was generous.  I had the smoked turkey, which was juicy and flavorful and the potato salad was off the charts delicious!  Looking forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"We ordered City Barbecue from door dash 2 weeks ago and loved it! I'm a big bbq fan and this was one of the best we've found around us in a long time. We decided to dine in tonight around 7pm and were greeted with friendly people. The food is wonderful and I loved the rustics decor. Everyone was so nice and had a sense of humor. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is ok.  Expensive for the portions. Lunch special sandwich was SMALL!  BBQ in concord is better."}
{"text":"Wow.  Best BBQUE in CLT.   No need to drive to 521 BBQUE now.  Sauce selection is delicious.  Great sides like baked beans and potato salad.   Awesome corn pudding.    Best banana pudding ever.  Staff very friendly.  We were their first customers right after their ribbon cutting ceremony.   Great peach cobbler and my mom said choc cake with choc chips was the best she ever had:).   Grand opening today.  So go by and sample their meats and sauces!"}
{"text":"Hands down...so far..City Barbecue is the BEST place to get Southern Finger Lickin' BBQ food with love on the side. I am so glad that I had stumbled on this place while in NC. I had ordered the half slab of pork ribs. It was delicious! You know my wife was mad since she had ordered the pulled chicken..which was good..but it could not match my ribs..nope..no way. Her pulled chicken didn't even come with a sauce. So before I left this restaurant (I had to wait at the pick up area since I had ordered the food online)...they had 4 bowls of different sauces. So make sure you take the time to fill a few small plastic cups of the different sauces. My wife only liked the Molasses sauce which helped improve the taste of her pulled chicken.

We got sides: hush puppies (fried perfectly), mac & cheese (it was \"o k\"), vinegar slaw (delicious) and collards (wife had really enjoyed them). As for dessert..my wife's order was better than mine. She got the peach cobbler, which was awesome. There I was....slowly eating my triple chocolate cake that was average. The cake reminded me of a triple chocolate cake that I had at a diner in Brooklyn not too long ago. This cake didn't have that southern charm to it. 

When we go back to NC..I don't care about the nearby fancy pancy restaurants near the hotel. We are going back to City Barbecue!!"}
{"text":"Having moved to Mooresville from Memphis 3 years ago, my husband and I are bbq snobs.  We are used to world class bbq and had been disappointed time and again by the various options near us until City BBQ opened.  I crave this place.  We've been 3 times now, but we'd go so much more often if 77 wasn't so terrible.  The pulled pork with Piedmont Pride sauce is my favorite.  We try to switch up our sides each time, but keep coming back to the collared greens.  They're so good!  Prices are very reasonable, considering the amount of food you get.  Staff is always friendly. I recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Great BBQ.  Great portions. I got two meats. Brisket and sausage. Lean brisket. No fat. Best I've had in Charlotte. Transplant Texan.  Sausage was ery good s well. Big sides. My daughter got pulled pork sandwich. Big portion and delicious.  We will definitely go back. Reasonable prices as well."}
{"text":"Good BBQ. Love the sauce selection. Brisket is always spot on!

The prices for some of the larger meat and side combos are great! The corn pudding is great, but Mac and cheese is just meh."}
{"text":"Love the incredible beef brisket, smoke chicken is awesome, sides are great, BBQ sauces amazing."}
{"text":"I was excited to see this place coming to Ballantyne, picked up a family pack on my way home from the game today. Everything was delicious. Pulled pork, brisket, beans and hush puppies."}
{"text":"The BBQ will leave you questioning why you came there when there are better choices just further down the road. Poor customer service with very little attention to detail. I had to correct them on the to-go order several times before they got it right. I also made a recommendation for their website and got a snarky reply in return. There are better choices out there... Skip this one."}
{"text":"Love this place! I don't frequent BBQ places, but this one has definitely made my go-to list. Everything is I tried was great: the hush puppies, beef brisket, pulled pork, collard greens, corn pudding, and even their potato salad! (And you know you can't eat everybody's potato salad.) on top of the great food, one of the managers came up to the table and checked on our experience. You could tell he really cares about customer service which is great. The only miss for this place is the Mac n Cheese. It would be better, way better. But everything else about this place made up for it, like the free samples of the sides before you buy. I really like this place; from the ambiance to the food, it's a hit."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed it! Great food, but I ordered to go so didn't get to experience all they have to offer service wise, so far so good. The ordering process was simple and I received good customer service, will update to five stars, hopefully, at a future visit... Great lunch spot!"}
{"text":"I had the smoked chicken, perfectly cooked generous portions, lots of Barbeque sauces to choose from.  The corn pudding is fantastic and the vinegar slaw is slightly sweet just like I like it!
We got the free chocolate cake for signing up on the app and the piece was huge and awesome.  They also have diet Mountain Dew which I love and is hard to find on a fountain.  Coming back again and again thanks guys for doing it right!"}
{"text":"Given the recent explosion of BBQ restaurants on 521 in the last year, I was anxious to try this one out. I will say that I think they're here to stay. Their brisket and pulled pork are tasty, but their sides are really what sets them apart. Corn pudding is amazing, green beans are awesome, along with the fries, mac n cheese and fried okra. Their sauces are really good too. The brushback sauce has some good heat to it, but it's tolerable. Their rewards program is good too. Makes it easy to come back for more. Definitely worth giving it a try."}
{"text":"I spent 7 years in TX eating BBQ in Houston and Austin.  Brisket is the best and I heard City BBQ could hold their own.  We stopped in for an early Sunday dinner and found very few other patrons.  Our family of four tried the kids chicken tenders and mac and cheese along with dinner pulled pork and brisket.  My sides were very good, both the hush puppies and potato salad.  The bushfire BBQ sauce was just right.  If the brisket had come out warmer than room temperature, with at least a choice of lean (rather than the mostly fatty which was served), and a larger portion it would have been pretty good.  The portion seemed more like a lunch size.  My wife's pulled pork was also barely warm with an ok flavor.  Of the three who had the mac and cheese, none of them liked it.  The cheese seemed runny and again it was barely warm.  While the brisket was good enough I would consider trying it again, the barely warm food overall gives me pause.  It was nice to see jalepenos, pickles, and onions available as a self serve option.  Overall the service was good and attentive.  Given hot food it would have been a good meal for me.  As it was, we will likely stick to the two nearby competitors who provide a better all around experience to meet everyone's tastes."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal and service!  My only complaint was the noise level.  For folks with a hearing loss, the music completely drowned out conversation."}
{"text":"Customer service and food was amazing, special thanks to Endiah for recommending the app."}
{"text":"Finger licking good barbecue sauce! I loved my pulled chicken bbq sandwich. The sweet sauce is my favorite. I had two sides--hush puppies and cornbread. They were phenomenal!! My husband had the large bbq chef salad with pulled pork and he liked it. The apple vinaigrette dressing was nice. The staff was super nice to give us samples of other side since it was our first visit--corn pudding is delicious! The potato salad is good too. The sweet tea is nicely sweet too. There is lots
of parking too. (Tip: They have sauces for to-go orders under the counter so ask for your favorite. The sauce for dining in is served warm.) The takeout service is excellent!!"}
{"text":"Best bbq in town. Also located on Monroe across from family dollar. Headquarters. Try the banana pudding if you have room"}
{"text":"My entire family LOVES City Barbeque!  The food is consistently outstanding, I'm particularly fond of the brisket and gumbo.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I can here during a private opening. 

The Bbq was really on point. Great coloring from the smoke but not too smoky. The staff was very friendly and they had a great selection of drinks, sauces and beer. The restaurant is not too big so I can see it getting busy."}
{"text":"What to say about City Barbeque... just awesome. 

My first experience at City Barbeque was incredible. I got to visit as part of an Elite Yelp Event, so we got a BIG taste of pretty much the entire menu of meats and several sides they serve over at City. I was so full about a quarter of the way through, but it was too delicious not to carry on...which we happily did.

Let me start off with the \"One of the best I've ever had\" section:
-Turkey: GEEZ. So much flavor in a white piece of turkey. This blows Thanksgiving turkeys out of the water. It didn't need sauce, it didn't need anything. 

-Sausage: It admittedly doesn't look like much on the plate but my god does the flavor hit you in the face. My girlfriend had tried the sausage first and urged me to bite into it and after I did all I said was \"wow.\"

-Baked beans: I don't even really LIKE baked beans. These were served piping hot and the flavor of the beans, sauce, and pork within the sauce was top notch.

-Strawberry Lemonade: I've had a few strawberry lemonades in my day and this was by far the most delicious and the freshest. It was refreshing as hell and I was sad when it was gone.

-Banana pudding: City puts their own spin on a banana pudding with their own made-from-scratch whipped topping and the addition of caramel. I'm usually not the biggest fan of both whipped toppings OR caramel but I must say I demolished mine. Great use of wafers in the pudding, too.

-BBQ/Brisket/SAUCES: I do NOT want this to get overlooked! I'm the kind of person that needs sauce with my bbq and brisket. Although I enjoy the standalone smokey flavor of meats, I just need da sauce. City had an array of sauces to choose from that compliments all the meats and that makes me the happiest. Special shoutout to the Swine Wine and the Piedmont sauces for holding it down for multiple meats.

-Vinegar Slaw: I have never had vinegar slaw before! This went with the meats SO WELL. Even if you aren't a slaw fan, you gotta try it.

Outside of the aforementioned foodz, everything else was still incredibly tasty. The ribs, the corn pudding, the green beans, the crispy hushpuppies. Anything you want to get here I have no doubt will leave you satisfied with portion size and flavor.

On top of all the food being good, the employees were super courteous and extremely helpful. They definitely made you feel like a \"guest\" and not just a customer that walks through the door, which you don't really notice until you have bad service. So hats off to them!

Living in DC the past 4 years, I didn't have much good bbq, but I'm so glad the first bbq place I came to after moving to Charlottte was City Barbeque and I can't wait to revisit!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Saturday night and they were plenty busy. It didn't take long to get our food. The food was excellent with good serving size but a little pricey. Don't forget the banana pudding because it's worth every penny"}
{"text":"Went to the Ballantyne location Saturday night, first time we have been to City Barbecue the food was really good, we had the ribs with Mac n cheese and bbq beans. The service was good staff was friendly and very attentive. We will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"Ive been looking for great bbq ever since I moved here from MEMPHIS, found it at City BBQ!  New favorite!"}
{"text":"Great place and food just a bit pricey. I thought for the price of the sandwich it came with at least 1 side. Service was awesome though."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming to city barbecue! My friends and I come here at least once a week. They have chicken BBQ which I love since I don't eat pork. The patio in the summer time is also beautiful! Definitely recommend, it's a great spot!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, busy during the lunch hour.  Quick service, get there at 11 and you will have a seat and good selection of ribs and brisqet"}
{"text":"Best barbeque I've eaten in years.  Better than any other local barbeque I've eaten. Ole."}
{"text":"I'm in town for a couple of days and since I'm a BBQ evangelist I turn to Yelp for suggestions.  This place lives up to the 5 stars it currently has.  The brisket was amazing and the ribs were just as good.  The okra had a cornmeal batter and was just a little salty but it was great.   The greens were good and fresh but I'm not a fan of stems in my collards.  I didn't even try bbq sauce because I believe good smoked meats don't need sauce... and the meat did not.  Eat here.  Do it."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went to City Bar B Que and it was delicious. It is located in the Ballentyne area on Hwy 521 behind the Walgreens. I ordered shredded pork, potato salad, and baked beans. There is plenty of food so we decided to take home  a peach cobbler. We were very impressed and have now been there another 3-4 times. I personally like a variety of flavors in my meals so this place is excellent. You get a variety of BBQ sauces from which to choose for your meat. The potato salad is creamy and not mustardy but if you want some, you can get a packet at the condiments corner.  The baked beans are sweet and just perfect in my opinion. We took home the peach cobbler and it was absolutely delicious right out of the fridge. I actually prefer it cold better than warm.  The corn pudding is fine but lacked flavor in my opinion. There is a small loaf of cornbread that is good and honey is found in packets at their condiments corner. Every time we go there, nice young men circulate the room to be sure your food satisfies you. My hubby and I have settled on this as our favorite place to eat BBQ. They cater and we will surely be using them for that. The prices seem very reasonable for catering. You can leave your dirty dishes on the table to be bussed but I usually bus my own to leave more room for the next customers. We have previously eaten at 521 BBQ and Jim n Nicks and this City Bar B Q is better than they are."}
{"text":"-- not my first review here but it's been a good long time since I've been in. I love the new ginger barbecue sauce. It's really different although I'm not happy about the price increase on some of the barbecue... everything is always great here and the staff is more than helpful. Absolutely love this location As they go the extra mile and it's always super clean and well-maintained! Kudos City!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  We ordered a turkey and ham for thanksgiving and both came out perfect.  I eat here about 2-3 times a month and am never disappointed.  I love the pulled pork and brisket sandwiches.  The ribs are 'so so' but everything else is awesome.  Get the brushfire sauce, it's spicy but not too bad."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place since it opened. A welcome restaurant to the area. Very clean indoors and surrounding the building, smell of BBQ smoke when you drive up, good sign.  I had the lunch special smaller portions,  choice if 1 meat and 2 sides. Tried the beef brisket and mac&cheese and fried okra. Very good meal. The brisket was so juicy and tender. I will be back with my family soon."}
{"text":"Don't stop reading my review because of the low score because...I'm willing to give them another chance! 

I think I caught them on an off day. And I'm sad to say I just wasn't impressed with my first visit. It didn't have anything to do with the service! They were kind and accommodating during the entire visit. I asked a lot of questions, asked for a sample and then had a small issue with my sides. But they were more than accommodating during my entire visit. 

 A little background, I anxiously awaited this visit. After seeing so many of my fellow yelpers friends LOVE it here... I knew that I wouldn't be disappointed. Seriously, I read a lot of reviews and there's a few folks that I know if they loved the food then I'm going to love it too. It's what happens when you hang with foodies who know good food!

That being said - perhaps my expectations were just too high. 

I ended up ordering the pulled pork with gumbo and baked beans. The pulled pork was tasty! I really loved the fixings and sauce bar. They have jalapenos! And I sampled most of the sauces with my favorite being the \"Low Co\" (the orange-ish one). Very good! 

My main issue was with the sides. First, I tried the gumbo wasn't exactly what I was expecting. But I let them know and the managers were so kind! They came over to the table asked questions and offered another item so I tried the fried okra. And they brought a fresh batch out and the spicy ranch was delish. But I wasn't a fan of the breading. Lastly I also tried the baked beans and they were just too thick and sweet for my liking. After the last one I just gave up and ate the meat. 

But I'm going to give them another try! Mostly because I enjoyed the meat and there are other sides that I want to try. Like the collards (they were out this visit) and the corn pudding - I sampled my friend's and it was really good. I'd order that next time for sure. I also want to try the other meats, the smoked turkey, ribs and brisket all looked delicious in pictures. 

So stay tuned! I'll be back.

***Thanks again to the managers for coming by our table and listening to the feedback! I really appreciate that you care about your customer's overall experience!***"}
{"text":"Loved the way the place is set up, the service was perfectly fine, the food was delicious, including the mac, the chicken and the hot BBQ sauce were perfect for each other and I really liked the banana pudding. Not my all-time favorite, but still very good. I'll be back!

No complaints, only compliments! Keep it up, City BBQ!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with Susan W this is one of the worst barbecue experiences I've had. I eat barbecue of all kinds from around the state and country. And this was some of the worst.

My chicken was raw in the middle, the ribs were dry and over sauced. The mac and cheese tasted like some kind of imitation cheese product and salt. The sweet barbecue sauce was just bitter molasses. The only decent thing I had were the hush puppies...and they were only decent.

They gave me free banana pudding due to my long wait for hush puppies.  Haven't tried it yet but I am not hopeful. Here's to $20 thrown in the trash."}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick place to grab some ribs for my pregnant friend when we came across this place. Honestly, we chose them over others for their fried pickles but were pleasantly surprise by their huge menu. 

We started with their fried pickles - which were amazing. They were crispy, lightly battered, pickle chips that came with chipotle ranch dressing. It was a very large basket that was more than enough for the 3 of us. 

I asked the gentleman at the register if he preferred the pulled pork or the brisket, he recommended brisket - which was great! It came plain and we had the choice of over 10 different barbecue sauces. I also asked him which sides were best, he recommended the mac and cheese and french fries. I went with the corn bread and mac and cheese. Neither were impressive, but maybe that is because I am from Wisconsin. My friends got the ribs, chicken, french fries, vinegar coleslaw, and french fries - all were amazing! 

I don't know what tipped off the staff, but they quickly realized that we weren't from around there so they insisted on giving us samples of all of their other sides (sample means about half of a side). So here is the run down... fresh french fries - amazing, mac and cheese - not great, corn pudding - my personal favorite, corn bread - again not great, gumbo - good but not my thing, sweet potato casserole - very sweet, and peach cobbler - good but very sweet.

The portions were huge, definitely share with a friend unless you want left overs. The staff was great, very attentive, friendly, and helpful. Someone even came to check on us about half way through our meal."}
{"text":"Just had the best Barbeque chicken I've had in a long time. The green beans and collards were awesome and so flavorful. I'll definitively be back to try out their other meats!"}
{"text":"Delicious bbq and top notch service. I ordered the 2 meat sampler with pulled pork and ribs. My sides were baked beans and creamy Cole slaw. I would order that exact meal again. Staff was very friendly! I will be back with my family!"}
{"text":"This place is like a chain and the BBQ is average. Good for a quick BBQ fix, but overpriced in my opinion. The saving grace is the variety of sauces you'll need to make the food tasty and the good drinks menu. If your looking for good BBQ try elsewhere."}
{"text":"Wow! So many choices....chicken, pork, sausage, turkey...7 sauces, 12 sides, 2 kinds of Cole slaw and beer or sweet tea to wash it all down. We got the lowdown on the menu from Will behind the counter. He walked us thru entire menu and even offered samples of gumbo for us to try. Diners order and pay at the counter. You can choose booths or tables indoors or sit outside at umbrella-topped tables. There are tv's located throughout tuned to sports venues. We dined late afternoon and there were few other diners at the time. The music over the stereo system was very loud and made conversation difficult. The servings of meat and sides were generous and we took home enough for another meal in the takeout containers provided at the self-serve stations where we got beverages and sauces. I'm definitely coming back for a taste of some of their other specials."}
{"text":"Good to see a barbecue restaurant in the University area. Ordered the pulled chicken sandwich, a brisket taco and okra. The chicken was moist and tender. I would have liked more flavor but once I added their barbecue sauce it was good. The brisket taco was very good and the okra was pretty good as well. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Good BBQ, but all the sauces are too sweet. Baked beans are really sweet too. Green beans are full of awesome bacon flavor. They have an allergen list and all of the sauces are gluten free. Just make sure to ask them to hold the toast and change gloves if you are gluten free."}
{"text":"Stopped on the way to Blacksburg- easy, delicious and very friendly staff. Pulled Pork was great and at least 6 different sauces."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious!!!
I had the leg and thigh chicken and for my sides I had potato salad and corn casserole, they were both yummy but the potato salad was my fav! My bf had the ribs and pulled chicken, his sides were Mac and cheese and green beens! All was AMAZING!!! Definitely give City BBQ a four thumbs up from us!!! Thank you for making great food that not only feeds the appetite but feeds the soul as well!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with this place! The cowbell was incredible- brisket was so tender! The customer service is seriously on point! The manager was really friendly and our cashier, Ansley, was bubbly and so helpful in finding what we like! Don't pass up the corn pudding- omg! Do yourself a favor and check out this City Barbeque location!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD!! Good food, great gluten free options, brisket is really good. And Robbie was super kind and helpful and patient. He had a great customer service!"}
{"text":"We joined a friend for lunch today and were so glad we tried this place out! We had such a great experience and the fella at the counter was extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and ensured us we could test anything before buying. We settled on the More Cowbell sandwich, which we were told is a Barbeque version of a Philly Cheesesteak, the pick 2 with turkey and brisket, and pulled pork for our little man. Everything was outstanding, we particularly enjoyed the More Cowbell sandwich. Thanks for the great experience, we'll be back the next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service!! Our server and the guy who took the order went above and beyond to make our family welcome. We will be coming back many times. It's only 5 minutes from home!"}
{"text":"This BBQ place is On Point!! We are close to Mac's Speed Shop and Lancaster's, both of which we love. We have been to the Huntersville City Barbecue multiple times, and they have always taken amazing care of us. They're smoked meats are so good that we tried AND LOVED their smoked turkey breast for Thanksgiving! We had family in town tonight and let them try it, Their manager Dot tonight took such good care of us, everyone loved it. If you haven't been here yet, try it out!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to give it a try. We asked the cashier what she would recommend, since this was our first time at City BBQ. She called over the General Manager. He walked us through the different types of meats and sides. Additionally, gave his suggestions. We ended up ordering two meals: Brisket with corn pudding and Brisket with fried okra. Both were fantastic. The corn pudding is a must! I'm a huge fan of fried okra...so, i'll always get that. But, the corn pudding is something I'll always suggest. 

They had a large selection of sauces too. But, the meat is so good, I found it difficult to use the sauces. I ended up dipping my Texas toast in the variety of sauces. All were good!"}
{"text":"Flavor of the meat is ok, nothing to write home about. 90% of the sauces are spicy or have heat to them. The lunch portion of sandwiches are good (quartet lb for lunch sandwiches and half lb for regular size)The price is on point for the rest of this area lunch wise. Lemonade is good too recommend that. Didn't try the tea since I'm a sweet tea snob. The customer service is really good. They seem to explain everything really well. The place is clean and a tv is visible from every seat. I hope they add wings to their menu though...no bbq place in NC should have anything less than vinegar base sauce, pulled pork and smoked wings! If you saw my picture you'll see I had banana pudding as one of my two lunch sides (yes it's allowed) and I will say they gave an honest effort. Don't expect soul food grandmama style banana pudding but I'd give it 3.5 out of 5"}
{"text":"Just tried this place had the sampler and the pulled pork was amazing! Brisket was great but not the best I've ever had. Chicken was perfect. Basically you can't go wrong with anything you pick. But what blew me away was the service, Charlie checked on us multiple times to make sure we were satisfied and had plenty of food."}
{"text":"Being from Memphis and being a long term competitive BBQ Pitmaster, I'm pretty tough on BBQ places. These guys do very good pig here. Nice smoke, good bark. 

I'm not a big fan of Carolina BBQ Sauce, and their alternatives were very basic. Tasty, but nothing special. I mixed three of them together to get a good Sauce. 

However, I am still ravings about their sides!  They need some good onion rings, but the fries, greens, corn pudding, and hush puppies I tried were phenomenal. 

A negative for me that they serve Pepsi, not Coke, but that really is a small think compared to the quality of the food. Pretty dang good spot. And the tunes were nice as well, with some Memphis Blues giving it a nice Honky Tonk vibe. 

Definitely should be on your list in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Incredibly friendly service!! I'd give the girl that took the order 5+ stars for being so patient! 

I'm not a huge BBQ fan but my family seemed to love everything they got with the sampler they ordered."}
{"text":"Food was made quick but was very fresh and tasty!!!! The ribs, baked beans and bananna pudding was the best. Both the inside and outside patio areas were spacious, nice and clean!!! Atmosphere was festive and all the workers looked clean and presentable and they were all so sweet and welcoming!!!"}
{"text":"Incredible. I came for the soft opening and left full and with a to go box with enough BBQ chicken, brisket, mac and cheese, and dessert that fed me for lunch the next two days.  Love the different sauces available on the bar.  City catered a team lunch so I was happy to find the consistency in the food, especially the brisket. A friend ordered the hush puppies and they were yummy as were the hand cut French fries. I love chocolate but the peach cobbler is the best! You must order the peach cobbler.  There is no way you will leave hungry as the portions are very generous. Can't wait to try the ribs next time."}
{"text":"Overpriced for quality. The baked beans tasted like vinegar and had large chunks of fat in it. My pulled chicken was just okay. My potato salad was good-ish. A bit salty but not terrible. I'm fine with not coming back although  it is a know favorite among co-workers. I'm just not sure why. Maybe it is because of the customer service; they were extremely nice."}
{"text":"For the life of me I don't understand the positive reviews. The food is dry, bland and overpriced. You have to pay extra for sides which is amusing since most other bbq places, regardless of how cheap they are, give you at least one side plus hush puppies. The mac and cheese is inedible . The set up of the place is undesirable. There are too many good bbq places in this area to waste money on this."}
{"text":"Only try the banana pudding if you want to get addicted. The ribs are great...especially if you mix their swine sauce and Piedmont Pride together...delish!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal. I ordered the rib bones, baked beans and slaw. The service was great and the people who work there are very friendly and helpful. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"City barbecue is worth the try. I have been to many bbq places but the variety, flavor and ambiance are great. We tried the judges sampler which states it for 2. I would say that's an understatement...it's probably for 3-4. The portion sizes are great! Next time I come to North Carolina I will definitely be stopping in! My favorite sides were the Mac and cheese and the collard greens!"}
{"text":"We tried the judges sampler and found everything to be very good. Would definitely recommend the chicken, brisket, and pulled pork. For sides, we tried to corn pudding and mac & cheese. Very good! The ribs were OK, but I have found the ribs at Sonny's and R&R to be much better."}
{"text":"First sign you see walking up says Voted Best BBQ in Charlotte.... I don't know about all that. The atmosphere is nice once you get inside but the food was very bland. I had the Brisket lunch special with Collar Greens and Mac&cheese. Sadly the collard greens were the best part of the meal. The brisket had no flavor and I had to drown it in sauce to make in enjoyable. And the Mac&cheese was just terrible, I read a review that mentioned they tasted like plain noodles and I can't agree any more."}
{"text":"Finally a place that knows how to make brisket! Flavorful, moist, tender, different cuts.  It is the best brisket I have had in the Carolinas.  I have been continously disappointed by the quality of brisket the other local competitors offer, so it was a treat to have it done right 

We also got ribs, which were very tasty.  The sides were good, and the service was friendly and fast.  Some people may be turned off by the stand and order set up, but a lot of the best bbq places are designed that way.  I thought it ran very smoothly.

It is definitely worth a visit.  Johnston and 521 is becoming ultra competitive for BBQ, but this place will get repeat business from me, and if you want good brisket, this is my top pick."}
{"text":"The great thing about City bbq is that you can pretty much sample everything before ordering so that you know exactly what you are getting before you get home.  I am really not a fan of the bbq here, and the brisket is just ok,  The smoked turkey and pulled chicken are the clear winners here, flavorful tender smoked turkey, I'll have 2 orders of that please.  There was no need for me to sample anymore of the meat after trying the turkey and chicken, I was sold.  The sides were not very impressive, especially the greens that seemed very oily for some reason.  I wasn't a fan of the mac n cheese, but it was fine for my son's liking.  The corn pudding was amazing but very buttery, and the potato salad was surprisingly tasty.  For dessert I took a chance on the banana pudding, it was described to me to have a butterscotch drizzle and some type of cookie crumbs on top..........amazing, get it!"}
{"text":"The barbecue is so good! I definitely recommend the chicken and the baked beans with brisket. We got the sampler which was perfect for two people. We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door and when we said it was our first time we got a delicious tasting of the pulled pork, brisket and chicken. The BBQ sauce is amazing but none of the smoked meats need any more taste. Wish I lived closer! I'd come too often!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! Best BBQ around I think, been here twice in two weeks, service is good, clean, great atmosphere! I got the chicken sandwich, was overall good, however way overpriced at $8.49 with no side included and it was pretty small! Added two sides and a soda came close to 15 bucks! So a little on the pricey side, but will be back due to the taste and atmosphere!

One tip for this restaurant- PLEASE ADD A CUT THROUGH ON THE STREET TO PULL IN. The road you basically have to make a u-turn if your passing oreily auto and coming in the side of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Best smoked BBQ lunch deal for under $10.  Brisket, beans with bacon, and corn pudding.  I can see a war starting just over that corn dish it's that good--sweet, savory, comfort food.   I order my brisket with bark and some of the fat cap.  I want to savor every lick of the hickory smoke that permeates it.  Mmmm.

Don't just give em a whirl; Go here!"}
{"text":"All in at this location, too.  Line moved quickly and efficiently.  The Friday lunch special I ordered was brisket with extra bark, collard greens, and mac-n-cheese.  All for under $10.  Delicious.  I think (other than my own) their collards are the best around.  

What a pleasant sight and smell on Monroe Road.  Welcome!"}
{"text":"Like brisket?  Look no more.  City BBQ has driven their \"interpretation of all things smoked\" stake deep into the heart of Dixie without apology.  East Carolina?  S Carolina?  Lexington?  Max's?  Midwood?  McCoy's?  Spoons?  They don't care.  City has their smokers loaded with shaggy-bark Hickory to face any competitor in the area.  And, let's just say, game on.  

Simply, in my humble and chubby opinion, one of the best briskets in the area.  My service experience was also very good.  They seemed to have worked out some of their opening missteps others have Yelped.  

PS:  Not a Carolina pork-based BBQ indigenous to the area (case you are wondering)."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed after reading all the great reviews, they definitely didn't go to the same place I went to. The food came out every fast, ribs were extremely tough and dry. The BBQ was dry as well and the macaroni was cold! Didn't find a single sauce that was what I call good. All the tables had stuff on them and the floor was very slick like it hadn't been cleaned in a while. I would highly recommend finding somewhere else to eat!"}
{"text":"Isaiah, the host/cashier, was extremely patient and helpful. We were passing through from northern Virginia to Atlanta and had never eaten at City BBQ, so his assistance wss well appreciated. The meat eaters in my family were well fed and I, the vegetarian, loved the ingredients of the side salad.

If you are looking for a place to eat along 77 near Charlotte, this restaurant had easy access to the highway and you avoid Charlotte traffic.

There's an outdoor patio and a huge indoor dining area."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had from a restaurant! The sauce is so delicious and the ribs fall right off the bone. The green beans have pork in them and they are delicious side to the ribs.I loved the Mac & Cheese but I wish it was a bit more cheesy!"}
{"text":"From the first bite it was clear that City had kidnapped my Granny and made her cook in their kitchen.  They literally took me back to Sunday dinner with the amazing sides. I loved trying all the different sauces and the endless supply of pickles. It was so good I had to come back the very next day. This place is a must try! And I will probably be back again tomorrow."}
{"text":"This is the worst bbq I have ever had in my life. Seems like an exaggeration, but I promise you it's not. We shared the city sampler because we were told it was enough to share. Think otherwise. The portions were mediocre and cold. The \"pork\" tasted like it was precooked and then cooked for about 12 hours after that. None of the meats or the sides had flavor. And don't even bother with the Mac and cheese, velveeta does it better. This just tasted like melted American cheese over noodles. On the other hand, the customer service was great and they were very friendly about our experience. Needless to say, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent, tender pork. Vinegar coleslaw has the perfect crunch and flavor. Their hush puppies are delicious and cooked to perfect crispiness! Baked beans are pretty good but their Mac and cheese is pretty bland, could use some spice or different cheese. Fries are good, fresh cut type!! I'll be getting those with hush puppies next time! Piedmont sauce is my favorite, spicy and not too sweet!! We'll be back-"}
{"text":"We eat lunch here all the time. The pulled pork has great flavor and the corn pudding is super great! I downloaded their app and we get discounts and coupons all the time with it. The food overall is really really good, with the more casual atmosphere. It's fast food-ish (ordering at a register and seating yourself) but is quality BBQ. Perfect for a busy Friday night when there are long waits at regular restaurants."}
{"text":"I'm thrilled to have this location open as it is extremely close to us. City BBQ has some of the best sides in Charlotte.   In the past, I've gone to the Ballantyne location. They have a lunch special during the week - I didn't see this available at the Matthews location but maybe it wasn't posted as I went on the weekend.  I've tried the pulled rib meat, pulled pork, and pulled chicken.  I don't care for the pulled chicken as it doesn't have a lot of flavor.  Pulled pork is good.  I really like the pulled rib meat ( again available at Ballantyne for lunch special but I did not see this on the menu at this location).  The mac & cheese is okay.  If you're only going to get one side then get the corn pudding - it's awesome and everyone I have been with agrees.  The fries are hand cut and really great as well.  I've only had the banana pudding for dessert and it's worth a try.  I think I will try the peach cobbler next time.  Great addition to the Matthews area!"}
{"text":"They are running this place with additional staff to ensure a smooth opening. The brisket is loaded with good balanced flavor, hush puppies are cooked to order as far as I can tell. They gave me two options for the brisket cut. Never has a BBQ asked me that. Staff is friendly and looking to ensure a pleasant experience. Bottled beer is on the menu for those 12 ounce curls some of us enjoy."}
{"text":"Food was good until I went to get a to go box and big roach/water bug crawls out of the box! 1st and last time visit! Maybe having paper boxes sitting around isn't a good idea!!!"}
{"text":"We tried City Barbeque for the first time yesterday and were thrilled with everything that we tried.  We both had the pulled pork sandwich, which is piled high with meat.  I ordered mine with cole slaw on top.  Sides are separate, and they had a seasonal item of sweet potato casserole, which was probably the best I've ever had.  Hushpuppies, baked beans with brisket, and mac & cheese rounded out the side selections.  The cashier offered to let us sample any of the menu items in making our selections which was very nice and helpful.  Later during the meal, they came around and offered samples of their banana pudding, which was incredible.  If we had saved any room for dessert, we would have ordered following the sample.  The manager also gave us a piece of their chocolate cake since we were gathered to celebrate my wife's birthday, and it was outstanding the next day.  
The sweet tea and lemonade are excellent; no Coca-Cola products unfortunately.  
They have more sauce choices than any BBQ restaurant I have ever been to.  I preferred the original over the Bourbon and Spicy versions I tried.  Definitely appeared to have something for everyone's taste.
Two sandwiches, four sides, and two drinks came out to $26.  
We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow. Awesome BBQ. Great venue and atmosphere. The cow bell for getting the sandwich I got was cool lol. 5* place all the way. Thanks for the hospitality"}
{"text":"I just don't think that City BBQ cuts the mustard.  There is so much competition within a five mile radius that beats Cities pants off.

First, it is a wait in line to order at the counter kind of place.  Very annoying and trying to decide over baskets or sandwiches, etc. starts your experience off on a bad note.  You pay the cashier and then maneuver toward a dining are amid a sea of wandering patrons.  And IF you can find a cleared table, good for you...you are blessed, but just for a moment.

Another area has drinks, condiments and utensils.  You jostle your way in and out.  Ice machine not spitting out ice, move on.  Finally you regain your island table and take in the trash and food on the floor as well as the overflowing trash receptacles.

Most customers just bus and available table.  

And then you await the calling of your name from the busy counter.  You must listen carefully as the noise is just too loud and your name might get consumed by the height of the unfinished ceiling.  Yes...you hear you name and jostle your way through the flow of people entering the dirty table maze to pick up your order.

With all that is the food that good?  Well...if you like fatty meat, that slick oily feeling and having to thoroughly wash your hands than you are truly in hot heaven.   

This was lunch.  We are not brave or desperate enough to try dinner.  Nope...on to 521 or Nick n' Jim's down the road.

City is a poor excuse for Southern BBQ or even Texas BBQ."}
{"text":"This place has earned five stars. We order take-out about once a week. The food is consistently high quality (two things that do not always go together) and the staff is awesome. The prices are also reasonable. It is nearly impossible to get excellent brisket and two sides for a little over $10 just about anywhere. 

They forgot one of our sides one evening. It was applesauce so it was not a big deal but I did not want to drive back for it. I did the survey online and received a call about an hour later. They definitely made it up to us.

Make sure to get the app - they will send you discounts and you can earn rewards, etc. More importantly, get the peach cobbler. It is amazing.."}
{"text":"Went with my mom, she got the pulled pork and it was very stringy and she had a very difficult time eating and enjoying it.  She had fried okra which she said was not as done as she liked, it was in my opinion though definitely better than the fried okra at all the other places that serve it.  I had brisket and collards and the corn pudding. The brisket was great and the corn pudding was so tasty and filling!  A standout.  The collards had a ton of meat in them and were very salty, which I like, but if you are watching your salt do not get them."}
{"text":"Over priced for the portion.  I ordered the sampler platter for 2, well it was portioned for 1.  Had a lot of fat in the brisket, one \"slice\" hiding crumbles of meat and fat.  The chicken was pink, tough.  Pulled pork was fair, I've had better.  The gumbo tasted like I was eating gravy with chunks of meat in it.  This is fastfood chain bbq.  Honestly I only liked the sauces.  If you want real bbq go to Midwood."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better Barbeque spots in the area.  I have been here multiple times and never disappointed.  My favorite is the brisket.  Did have a little too much fat on it today but the manager addressed it and brought a new serving along with hot fries and dessert.  Service is always friendly, they seem to enjoy their jobs."}
{"text":"When I first saw that this place opened I thought LAWL not another BBQ place in Charlotte!  But I was in the area at lunchtime and decided to try it. I got in line about 11:45 and when I left at 12:30 it was packed.  I had the light lunch brisket, with bark and marbling.  It was thinly sliced and tender, really did not even need sauce! Sides are the most difficult decision ever to make in life.  I had the vinegar slaw, chunky and so tart and fresh, a flavor explosion that tempered the BBQ perfectly. Hush puppies were large and nicely crafted in shape, not sweet and not oniony, just a heaping portion to tone down any heat.  Next time I will try the collards and potato salad.  Outdoor seating looked cool too! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had the Lolo pulled pork sides: green beans, baked beans and creamy slaw. Pulled pork had no flavor, not even a hint of smoke, was super greasy and blah. I had to douse it in more vinegar just to get it down. Green beans were great. Slaw was forgettable, way too sweet and creamy (I guess that is why they clarify it as creamy). Baked beans were ok but be warned very sweet and sugary. Overall, the focus should be on the BBQ and it was forgettable."}
{"text":"I've visited City Barbeque 5 times since their opening this location.  Overall, the food and the service is great.  The problem is their prices are way too high.  While they do give you huge portions, I'd prefer smaller, more normal-sized portions, combined with more reasonable prices.  My most recent visit was on a Saturday at around 12:45 pm.  There were maybe 4 tables occupied at what would normally be a busy time for restaurants (Famous Toastery next door was packed).  I was surprised at how empty it was until I was hit with my almost $50 bill for my family of 3.  I had a sandwich with two sides and a drink.  My wife had the same and my son had a kid's turkey sandwich with fries and drink.    By comparison, the weekend before, we had an appetizer, two entrees, and a kids meal at Olive Garden for slightly less.  This, of course, included soup or salad and breadsticks.  Yes, I know Olive Garden is not all that special and City Barbeque provides a more unique experience, but also consider, there is no further service at City beyond preparing the food.  You pick up you own food, get your own condiments and drinks, and clean up your own tables.   In conclusion, I would love to see this restaurant succeed, but am concerned that now that the excitement of a new place has worn off, people are realizing the overall value isn't as good as it could be.  I truly believe if they would cut their prices and portion sizes, they would be a much better value and I, along with many others, would visit more often."}
{"text":"Overhyped? Nope, not in the slightest! You'll know how impressive the food is going to be with the intense, savory BBQ aroma that hits you like a semi truck!

Right off the bat you'll see a much wider variety of meat options on the menu than most BBQ places around. I was very intrigued by the smoked sausage. Not only will they give you a sample of any menu item, they encourage it with a big sign inviting you to simply ask! I decided on the Brisket and Sausage. Usually for sides I stick with Mac & Cheese and Cole Slaw at BBQ restaurants, but because of the long list I decided on Corn Pudding and Collards!

The meats, WOW! Smoked sausage that reminded me of authentic Texas BBQ. Moist, tender brisket with an amazing smoke profile. The collards were noteworthy, perfectly cooked and seasoned, with a good amount of pot broth. The corn pudding reminded me of a sweeter version of Corn Casserole. While the corn was good, next time I'm just getting 2 collards!

So we tried 5 of the numerous BBQ sauces and I'll mow through them real quick (all purely subjective mind you. Your mileage may vary!). City sweet was... Sweet, it was OK. Original was good, balanced flavor but not very bold. Burbon was a more dynamic sauce than original, nice savory note. Piedmont Pride, uh if you like vinegar so much you can take it in an IV drip then maybe this is for you, it's not for me. Spicy Ginger, oh boy this is a winner! Nice, mild spice with just the right sweetness. Reminds me of a ginger Sweet Chili sauce.

So there you go, I can't wait to try more! The cashier had a brief moment of impatience it seemed, but they were having technical difficulties that delayed the ordering process more than it should have. Things happen, I just hope the food is as excellent next time as it was last night!"}
{"text":"I went here for a Yelp elite event and I must say these folks showed us the works. First off, they have a variety of drinks you can pick from alcohol (beer) and non Alcohol. I had the Amber rock beer and it was delicious. The food was fantastic, from the pulled pork to brisket. They showed us their unique way of smoking the meats and how they flavor their food. It was a great event and it put their food on center stage. I would go back. Very delicious food."}
{"text":"BOOM! Finally someone doing it right in NC, with bbq almost as good as the best in TX and KC! The food is served up quick, the atmosphere is wonderful, service on point, and the food delicious. There is nothing more you could ask for. 

Tried the smoked turkey, brisket, and green beans. Along with a small piece of Texas toast. All of this for around $17. Good sized portions too. Many sauces to use but the brisket didn't need it. 

I'll be back"}
{"text":"We went for Veterans Day and they were very generous and offered a nice meal to veterans.  Their food is excellent and if you are not sure what you want, they will give you a generous sample to try any of their meats.  Everything we have had has been terrific.  We have been several times and the staff is always friendly and very helpful.  A lot of Bar-b-que restaurants have opened in this area in the last year or so. As far as my husband and I are concerned, this is the best bar-b-que in Charlotte.  If you haven't tried it, do so."}
{"text":"Great concepts, but lacking real content.

After reading so many raving reviews about this place I decided to give it a try. Got the beef brisket, vinegar slaw, and hushpuppies.

Beef brisket was very tender but did not have any outstanding flavor. Vinegar slaw was pretty good. Hush puppies were super dense and left a heavy feeling in my stomach. 

Piedmont Pride sauce was just a little variant of your typical vinegar sauce. Lo-Co sauce was different and I liked it.

Your typical barbecue chain"}
{"text":"Great new BBQ joint in south Charlotte. Succulent, perfectly smoked meats. Eclectic mix of delicious sides. Can't decide what to order? Ask for samples, which they gladly provide. Great atmosphere.

This was our second visit and since we had a buy-one-get-one-free coupon, my wife and I splurged and both got the double meat combo (which is Fred Flintstone big.) We tried the pulled pork, beef brisket and chicken breast. All were excellent but the star here is the brisket, which had the perfect char and smoke. It'll be my go-to dish going forward here. For our sides, we chose the collards, which were cooked perfectly, a side salad, and mac and cheese.

Serving sizes were huge. Service was tops. Sanitation score was a 98. All signs of a well-managed restaurant and one that I will label a Gotta Try for sure!"}

{"text":"So you know it was such a nice day when I ordered from City Barbeque, well I didn't order directly through them but I found them through DoorDash which provides deliveries for just about any restaurant or fast food place around.  If you are looking for some great not just good bbq this is it.  I like to wait to make my reviews just so I don't become impulsive.  I also just saw that a yelp event was here I am so jealous!!  I was not given the opportunity to discover this place before now.  Sorry DoorDash but next time I am going in person.  I ordered the Pulled Pork w/Bun and Fresh Cut Fries.  

Those fries tho... LAWWWWWWD  they were so fresh and just right and there was so many.  I could have taken some home but they never made it I tore them down!  The sandwich/that pork was just crazy and I mean crazy stupid in a good way because it takes a lot for some food to really have me excited like this to the point my heart rate is racing just thinking about it.  It was so good I mean I have not had bbq this good in probably 2 or 3 years.  I had them bring me 2 sides of the Sweet BBQ sauce and I was again blown away at how good and authentic it tastes.  Put's a LOT of other sauces to shame.

I almost shed a tear and I was saying to myself I have got to review this place because it blew me away.  They say that they give \"the same attention they would give to their own family\" I really believe that because the only person that really made BBQ this good in my past was my grandma and grandpa at their bbq pit.  

This food took me back and I thought about my Maw Maw who passed away she always made sure I had everything I needed and was always trying to feed me even when I was slam packed full.  The portions here are very generous so at first I though the prices were high but they are COMPLETELY acceptable for the quality and care that goes into the food. They have one in Ballantyne (the one I ordered from) and in Matthews.  I heard they are building one in another part of Charlotte as well.  I hope that they all do their food to perfection because this is the way it's supposed to be.   I told DoorDash to ask for extra napkins because I'm messy so they really put some extra napkins in there and they are QUALITY napkins like not that cheap mess they are custom printed and will open up to be able to cover your whole top part of your shirt yeah they are nice.  They hooked me up with extra so now when someone needs a napkin I give that out and tell them about City Barbeque.  You guys deserve it and please keep up the fantastic work I can't wait to bring friends and family in!

My only problem is I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Usually great bbq I've eaten the brisket  numerous times but this time it wasn't up to par... 60% fat pieces.   Not burnt ends like i ordered.   Hard to fathom paying $15 for pieces of fat."}
{"text":"Great service and food! We came two days in a row b/c it was that good. I'm addicted to the corn pudding and ribs, like I could eat them every day. 

I also love the family packs they have and the options for larger party packs. And while I sat and waited for my food I saw some whole ham and turkey offers that may be on my table for Christmas.


Great place"}
{"text":"This is a review of the restaurant as it normally operates.

Last Monday, we dined at a Yelp Event here at City Barbeque and it was a fantastic event and I gave it a good review and rated it very high.   Review is elsewhere on Yelp.

Wanted to come back and see the restaurant and staff when they were not part of Special Event to see if I would still feel the same. Also, Frank from Corporate kept talking about a Lolo Sandwich which is an Eastern NC Style Pulled Pork Sandwich. Wanted to see if these guys from Ohio could come up with as good a Que as found down East.

This is a separate review from my Yelp review and is based on my experiences today and photo's are also from today.

Drove down from Church in Davidson and got there about 10 minutes before they opened at 11:00 am which is Sunday Hours. Opened promptly and went straight to the counter and placed out order.

Noted that virtually no one of the staff we had seen on the previous Monday were there.

My wife up until know has not been a BBQ fan but recently she has become a fan of Pulled Pork although she likes to put it on her salads.  Bit surprised she is migrating toward the Sweet Bourbon Sauce. Along with that, she also ordered the Corn Pudding along with Fried Okra.

I had the Lola Pulled Pork and tried both the Swine Wine and the Sauce they provided but neither provided the balance of hot and sour I like. From what I understood, the Lolo came with the Vinegar Slaw on top as opposed to the Creamy but this was not the case unless you asked for the alternative. They readily made the change. Watch out BK. someone else is going it \"you're way\"  . As sides I had the Potato Salad and the Corn Pudding.

Except for wanting a slightly spicier and more astringent Eastern NC Sauce, it was perfect and since I don't sauce heavily anyway, still gave them high marks based on the the quality, taste and texture of the pulled pork alone.  The Corn Pudding and the Potato Salad are reasons to come here along.

Getting back to  different staff, still great and its nice to see that there is considerable depth to the staffing. Great job in training and staffing."}
{"text":"The BBQ Wars heat up and this new one is going to give the ole boys a run for their money.

This is the third location to open in the Charlotte lately. Actually the official opening date for this one is tomorrow June 19 and a fourth will be opening in Huntersville later this year.

Founded a little over 20 years ago in Columbus Ohio, these guys have made a science of all styles of BBQ. Rather than just one style of BBQ, they have studied all and have have pretty much mastered all of them from Eastern NC style called a Lolo to the tomato based Lexington style to Mustard Based SC Style to Memphis to Texas Brisket to St. Louis Ribs.

They showcased all of these and more and we got a chance to try smoked turkey, smoked Texas Sausage, BBQ Chicken, Pulled Pork, Texas Brisket and a full rack of St. Louis Ribs along with a number of sides including BBQ Beans, Potato Salad,Corn Pudding, Hush Puppies and for desert, Banana Pudding.

Out of all of this, the only thing I did not like was the Hush Puppies which were a bit greasy on the inside.  That said, forget the hush puppies because there are so many other things to dine upon and not fill us the the Hush Puppies.

Very open and friendly staff and between on of the original founders, the store manager and dining room manager, they made us feel right at home. We had a chance to see the smokers both inside and out, the kitchen prep area and had several demonstrations on the proper way to serve the meat.

This is going to be a good place for BBQ. If you bring in a private sauce often found in BBQ restaurants, you get a free t-shirt. They also are working with the community schools and non-profits on fund raising project."}

Sausage link hard and not good.. Collard Greens taste terrible no season.. Bake beans average.  Tea was great have not taste the cake we both because I was just displeased and ready to go... I ate at university location and the food was finger licking good ordered more because it was so good."}
{"text":"What? 4 stars? Come on now, yelp, I know this is Charlotte, but this is not good BBQ. Truth be told, the meat alone would warrant a 3 star review; for context, Sauceman's is the only BBQ in the city worthy of a 4.5 star review, with Midwood coming in at a 3.5 - 4. But the sides are horrifically bad. Mac and cheese that tastes like it's made with processed cheese. Tasteless fried okra. Cornbread that tastes like it comes from a box. 

On the bright side, the sauces are good, so grab some to go and get better smoked meat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Northerners can make barbecue!
Conveniently across Tryon from UNCC,

Lolo's pulled pork is my favorite for lunch, but I forced myself to try the brisket sandwich this time when I ordered at the counter. . 
Lunch special included 2 sides for $9. Sandwich is small, but sides are generous. 
Everything here is so fresh and delicious. 
I can highly recommend the pulled pork, chicken, brisket as I have tried them all. For sides I liked the cream slaw, green beans, cornbread, and potato salad.  Even eating here at least once per week for lunch for a month. Mac-n-cheese was more my daughters style than mine, but I only had to add a little hot BBQ sauce and I scarfed it down."}

The new space is lovely with wood tables and some local UNCC gear on the walls. Definitely full of southern hospitality and the BBQ is delicious. I had the sandwich with brisket, onions, peppers and horseradish sauce. The corn pudding blew me always for the side and the green beans with bacon were smoky and flavorful. They have a BBQ sauce bar with 6 different options plus onions, picked jalapeños and pickles. My husband was drooling over the brisket and pulled pork and could not have been more thrilled that they have gumbo as a side!

{"text":"Quite disappointed after hearing great reviews from friends. Would still go back for a quick lunch in the area, but would be very selective of what I ordered.

Wife had a pulled pork sandwich with hush-puppies/mac & cheese. I had the two meat option (brisket/ribs) with corn pudding/baked beans.

Pulled pork: Was not overcooked (usual complaint with restaurant pulled pork), decent bark, light smoke, not much flavor overall - 6/10

Ribs: Cooked well, clean bite without pulling away from the bone, good rub, light smoke - 8/10

Brisket: This was supposed to be the heavy hitter, but fell flat on its face. Good bark, strong beef flavor, overcooked, dry, dry, dry, and dry. Asked for a mix of fatty/lean, received only lean brisket that crumbled to dust just by looking at it - 3/10 

Hush-puppies - They are hush-puppies done well. Simple and effective - 8/10

Mac & Cheese - Stove top style, creamy, mild flavors, average overall - 6/10

Baked Beans -  Sweet enough to be dessert, decent seasoning, packed with large chunks of brisket, and was unable to eat more than a few bites due to sweetness - 4/10

Corn Pudding - Smooth, creamy, savory, sweet. Great side that will not disappoint - 9/10

Sauces across the board - Very sugar forward, tastes commercially produced, meh - 5/10"}
{"text":"I absolutely love BBQ and would consider myself somewhat of a BBQ snob. While Charlotte certainly has plenty of BBQ restaurants, most are not memorable, objectively bad, and just not worth visiting. So, when friends and family started telling me about City BBQ, a chain nonetheless, I really was not expecting much. I was more than pleasantly surprised, though.


SERVICE
Like a fast food joint, you order your food at the counter and then pick it up once it's ready. Unlike a fast food join, the employees here are actually friendly and (at least seem to) enjoy their jobs.


FOOD
I'll start with where City BBQ shines: the meat. After sampling some of the bland BBQ that Charlotte has to offer, you might come into City BBQ and ask yourself what this strange flavor is. It's wood smoke. And City BBQ uses different types of wood for each meat, the way it's supposed to be done. In addition to pulled pork, City also serves brisket (not real BBQ), chicken (also not real BBQ), and ribs. All four meats taste great and are served with plenty of bark (unless you get chicken, which is not real BBQ). I believe they also serve sausage, but I have not tried it.

The side items are also worth noting. City has the typical BBQ restaurant sides like fries and slaw, but they also have a few others such as fried okra and corn pudding. They all taste great and come in fairly generous portions.

Each table comes with a few bottles of City's own BBQ sauce, and there is even a condiment bar with more. City also has thickly-sliced pickles, jalepenos, and red onions. Oh, and they have plenty of wet wipes in case eating your ribs get a bit messy (or if you're eating chicken, which isn't real BBQ).


PRICES
City's prices are in line with other BBQ places, which tend to be around $15 per meal. I would consider that pretty fair.


Overall, I really enjoyed City and have been back. My only real complaint is their menu layout. Every time I go, there is always someone in line who does not understand that everything is ordered separately. City, throw a combo with a meat and a side up there to move things along and to avoid the \"what do you mean my meat doesn't come with a side\" talk.

PRO TIP: before you go, download the app and sign up for an account. You get a free drink on your first visit and then $5 off your next meal for every $100 you spend. If you have a family, this is essentially $5 off every other visit."}

Like a fast food joint, you order your food at the counter and then pick it up once it's ready. Unlike a fast food join, the employees here are actually friendly and (at least seem to) enjoy their jobs.


FOOD
I'll start with where City BBQ shines: the meat. After sampling some of the bland BBQ that Charlotte has to offer, you might come into City BBQ and ask yourself what this strange flavor is. It's wood smoke. And City BBQ uses different types of wood for each meat, the way it's supposed to be done. In addition to pulled pork, City also serves brisket (not real BBQ), chicken (also not real BBQ), and ribs. All four meats taste great and are served with plenty of bark (unless you get chicken, which is not real BBQ). I believe they also serve sausage, but I have not tried it.

The side items are also worth noting. City has the typical BBQ restaurant sides like fries and slaw, but they also have a few others such as fried okra and corn pudding. They all taste great and come in fairly generous portions.

Each table comes with a few bottles of City's own BBQ sauce, and there is even a condiment bar with more. City also has thickly-sliced pickles, jalepenos, and red onions. Oh, and they have plenty of wet wipes in case eating your ribs get a bit messy (or if you're eating chicken, which isn't real BBQ).


PRICES
City's prices are in line with other BBQ places, which tend to be around $15 per meal. I would consider that pretty fair.


Overall, I really enjoyed City and have been back. My only real complaint is their menu layout. Every time I go, there is always someone in line who does not understand that everything is ordered separately. City, throw a combo with a meat and a side up there to move things along and to avoid the \"what do you mean my meat doesn't come with a side\" talk.

PRO TIP: before you go, download the app and sign up for an account. You get a free drink on your first visit and then $5 off your next meal for every $100 you spend. If you have a family, this is essentially $5 off every other visit."}
{"text":"Well it ain't cheap, for sure.   But on the flip side, you wont go home hungry.   I went with the lunch menu sandwich and for the life of me (online menu does not have lunch menu), I cannot remember the name.  It was spicy something or another.   I was a little taken back, I think with drink, it was $14.99, which totally sucks for lunch.   But, it was a ton of food.  The Texas Toast was perfectly buttered, the brisket was to die for and overall - it was not over the top spicy.

Hand cut fried, huge portion.   Freshly cut and freshly fried, yum.   Mac and ULTRA creamy cheese was a hit.  I probably could have split this with my son, but I was feeling froggy.   It is a great place with a great vibe, I am not sure how the location will work.   A lot of spots tend to close after a year or so around that location, we shall see though."}
{"text":"This was my first time at City Barbeque.Everything sounded good on the menu,but I only had a taste for particular things.I ordered the brisket tacos (3),pulled pork,and a side of potato salad.No..no..no..I did not eat all of that in one setting.Lol!The brisket tacos were amazing.The pulled pork was seasoned well and I love how you can choose multiple BBQ sauces at your convenience.I tried at least three of them and they had their own unique flavoring.One of them,I think the wine one,did have me choke a little bit as it was initially strong.They also offer homemade pickles on the same bar as the BBQ sauce.The pickles were really good.I couldn't resist as I love pickles.

Customer Service--the young lady that took my order was really nice and actually cared about helping me figure out what I wanted to order.She even gave her feedback,as well as past guest.There was a guy calling out the orders as they were ready and I just loved his enthusiasm.He spoke as people entered,as they left,and even asked how their meals were when he saw them packing up.He asked me too.I love being in a customer focused environment.Kuddos to the team here!!I will be back!"}
{"text":"This was our 2nd visit. The BBQ is fantastic with a good selection of sauces, the collards are hands down the best I have ever eaten. Looking forward to trying the ribs."}
{"text":"I really love barbecue. Nothing puts a smile on my face like a juicy, tender, smoked piece of pulled pork with some classic Carolina sauce. So when I heard that a new barbecue joint had opened up, naturally, I was excited and ready to give it a try. A week after this place opened, I entered with an empty stomach and a craving for some good ole southern BBQ. 

Upon entering the restaurant, I was thoroughly impressed with the setup. It had a modern vibe, but also an appeal to a classic steakhouse/bbq restaurant with all sorts of western and southern memorabilia on the walls. 

The staff are very friendly and the atmosphere is very much welcoming. The lines can get long, but for me, that usually is a good indicator of the quality and popularity of the food.

Once I got to the register, I decided I wanted to try a little bit of everything, so I ordered the sampler. This came with sausage, pulled pork, smoked chicken, and garlic bread.


After not that long of a wait, fortunately, I received the food and also went to get some barbecue dipping sauces. I was genuinely impressed with the sauce bar, which had all sorts of local sauces to try. I took a small cup of the original and sat to eat.

After finishing my meal, I was absolutely and massively... unmoved. To City's credit, the chicken was smoked well but that's about it. The pulled pork, sausage, and garlic bread were all unimpressive. I felt the pulled pork could've been smoked a little longer and the garlic bread just missed the mark. The sausage was ok at best.

For all the hype this restaurant received, I was expecting something at least exceptional, and I cannot say that expectation was met.

I give City Barbecue a 3 out of 5 to match its mediocrity in quality of food."}
{"text":"First time trying City BBQ. I've been wanting to and it's raining today so GrubHub to the ready. Because I always want to try everything I got the Judges Sampler. Easy it a meal for two good eaters. Lots of food and everything was very good. The brisket was a little disappointing in that is was just little pieces, leftovers it seemed. Not one whole slice. While also being a little dry it did have a good taste. Ribs, pork, and chicken all very good.  Sides, corn pudding this was outstanding and collards with BBQ and it was some of the best I've had. It's almost more like BBQ with collards. This place is a keeper."}
{"text":"Reminds me of Mission BBQ back home.
Friendly staff and awesome food. Ordered the lunch special of pulled pork sandwich and two sides.  The counter person gushed about the collards and Mac & cheese and she was on point!'  The only drawback is that while everything tastes so good the portions are too large for me to finish!

*extra unexpected perk alert*

Had to wait 3 minutes for more Mac & cheese which resulted in offer of large drink on the house!

Thank you City BBQ"}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I enjoyed their catering at a wedding a few months ago and was impressed with a Yelp Elite event back in December. That being said, I had a nice lunch on one of those way-too-warm-for-February Saturdays out on the patio with two adults and a toddler.
 
We ordered the family meal with four meats (turkey, pulled pork, sliced beef brisket and sausage), three sides (hushpuppies, cole slaw and collard greens) with two serious slices of Texas toast. With the ample pickle and sauce bar we had plenty of opportunities to enhance and compliment the already flavorful meats and most certainly had enough to fill up a to-go box at the end. I'm a particular fan of brisket and sausage, which did not disappoint, both on tenderness, juiciness and plain old chewability, but I like coming here because they have enough sauces to keep things interesting for everyone, including a nice mustard sauce and spicy tomato-based sauce.
 
Midwood Smokehouse's Ballantyne location is nice and a standout for Charlotte with Mac's Speed Shop, but newcomer to Charlotte City Barbeque has garnered my respect. Look forward to seeing the other three planned locations (Matthews, University area and Huntersville) succeed in the months and years ahead. Be sure to check out Rise Biscuits & Donuts next door!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time eating at this location. The first time was on Thursday for family and friends day. The customer service was ok upon entering and ordering our meal but once our food came out there were items missing, not 1,2 but 3. Also we ordered banana pudding but they gave us chocolate cake instead we informed the waiter he said they ran out not sure why they didn't mention it as we were ordering but any who the food was delicious. The half chicken was juicy and tender surprisingly  the breast portion wasn't dry. The collards we're a little salty for my liking. The house made peach cobbler is a must try yummmmm, the chocolate cake was good as well just needed a side of ice cream. I loved the BBQ picnic look & feel. It was worth coming back again so I did. Now today I ordered take out I got the leg&thigh tender and juicy as I remembered. Mac&cheese was a little cheesy this time around. Potatoe salad was everything FYI it has celery in it. This time I made sure to order the banana pudding and it was all that and more yummmmy FYI it has Carmel in it so I was a bit skeptical but it served it's purpose. I will sleep good tonight."}
{"text":"This is a chain restaurant however their food is incredible. They have so many sauces to choose from. I had the slaw and fries with my sandwich. Those were both great choices. Their hush puppies are great too."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in clt. By far. I've tried a lot different BBQ places and this one is the best. Few different locations to choose from. They are very consistent. I'd suggest the Sausage, Brisket and the Ribs. Sides: fries, beans, collards, and green beans are all great. Texas toast is superb. The Mac and Cheese isn't that great tho."}
{"text":"This location still has a lot of bumps to work out because consistency is not key here. I was thrilled to have this University location open due to the proximity to my house and because I enjoy City Barbeque's food and Matthews location.  However, after having been on multiple occasions, I can confidently share that the food is good but the food preparation/service is not great.

If this place is busy and you're ordering take-out, make sure you CHECK YOUR ORDER before you leave because, chances are, they will screw it up. Even though they read back your order, they will still leave out items.

Other than the accuracy issue, they still provide the same menu items found at other CB locations. Food is served pretty quickly and they will normally try to make up for any errors they have caused. On the weekends, I do wish that they had TWO people consistently on the registers. Most recently, I was there during the Saturday lunch rush and there was one cashier. The line was past the entrance and yet, the one cashier remained. Also, it would be helpful to have someone who periodically checks the tables and wipes up messes. Every time I've been there, the condiment & 'fixins' section (where the pickles, BBQ sauces are located) has always been sloppy. Doesn't really make you want to sample BBQ sauces when they're spilled everywhere.

I must share that the CB app is great and allows for you to rack up points so that you can, in turn, redeem them for \"rewards\" such as taking $5 off any order, free beverage, dessert, etc."}
{"text":"This place fully delivers on their promise of being devoted to the craft of BBQ. As of right now, this is the closest location to me and is a bit of a hike but worth every mile. Bright side? They are opening a location in the University area in the coming months.

Full disclosure: I got to try out this location a few months ago thanks to a Yelp elite event and was able to try the chicken, sausage, pulled pork, ribs, brisket, and a slew of sides. Not to sound hyperbolic, but everything was truly delicious. However, I found that the brisket was the clear-cut winner.

For this visit, I went with the 'pick-two-meat option': pulled pork and brisket and an order of Lo's pulled pork sandwich. As the side for both, I chose the creamy cole slaw for one and the vinegary cole slaw for the other.  While waiting for my order, I hit up the fixins bar. I scooped up a few of the sauces in to-go containers, as well as some pickles and red onion. I love this feature

I got the two meats for my parents to enjoy and that they did. They are both extremely difficult to please when it comes to BBQ meat but found nothing to criticize with City BBQ. My meal was the pulled pork sandwich and I loved every bite. The cool, crunchy vinegary slaw added delicious texture to the smoky, juicy pork.

If you consider yourself a BBQ connoisseur, I recommend you head over to your nearest City BBQ and load up on #allthemeats."}
{"text":"I have to admit I didn't know what to expect from City Barbecue, but I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised by my meal. I had the barbecue leg and thigh, green beans and hush puppies, and I enjoyed EVERYTHING. The chicken was moist inside and well seasoned. The green beans were unbelievable!.....bursting with flavour. And the hush puppies were hot and crispy. I particularly enjoyed the mustard based barbecue sauce too. I'd definitely go back. 
Okay....we went back and enjoyed our food again, but found that the prices are too high to continue eating here. I consider $26.00+ for two people to be more than I want to spend for barbecue chicken, baked beans and string beans. (I didn't even get a drink with my meal. I just had water.) Especially since it's not a restaurant where you are served your food at your table. There are less expensive options out there. A man sitting at another table hollered over to us (it wasn't at all crowded), and asked us how much we paid for our food. He said he just paid $37.00 for food for himself and his friend! He said that's way too much money. 
If they lower their prices, we might go back. If not, we probably won't."}
{"text":"Ordered through door dash, decided to get the family pack. The cornbread was missing from the order, and the family pack is advertised to feed four people, but it is really not that much food. I feel like we didn't get our money's worth. The food is average."}
{"text":"Not worth comparing this with (what I personally consider) good, authentic, smokey \"Q\" from deeper in the South; AL/MS.  In truth I \"appreciate\" but do not prefer, the more popular, local vinegar/mustard based sauces.  Regardless of sauce preference, my criticism was that City's pork tasted steamed; actually overly-tender, apparently from moisture rather than from hours over wood.  My best advice - keep heading south on Johnson Road for five minutes to Jim & Nicks; (near Lowes parking lot) for real hickory smoke style meat; smoke so heavy its hard to wash from your hands!"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! I had the lunch size pulled pork (and added swine wine - an eastern style bbq sauce with some heat), fried okra, and collards. I've been 3x and each time it's been great with stellar service."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood behind here and were so excited to get a restaurant within walking distance. We LOVE city BBQ and we've never been disappointed with our meal. It's always fresh and delicious. The associates are all very friendly and accommodating. I came with my grandparents and my grandfather is in a power wheelchair, they went above and beyond to make sure he was comfortable and routes were accessible and even brought a high chair over for my daughter before I even sat down. Can't beat the food or the service. Also, it was their pulled pork, not the Hawthornes pizza that put me in labor ;)"}
{"text":"Ate lunch there two days ago for first time. OK experience. Got pulled  pork, hushpuppies and vinegar slaw. Pork had good taste but also had a lot of fat and burnt meat. Sort of a turn off since you're paying for it. Sauces offered were good. Hush puppies were excellent, slaw just average. And thought price was a little high considering you have to wait on your self and clean your table and in general all meats are inexpensive.  However we will try it again."}
{"text":"This place if awesome! Not just the food, but the service is very friendly and they're very generous. The pulled pork is phenomenal and I'm not a fan of vinegar, but theirs is delicious. Everything on the menu is good, you can't go wrong. Their sides are excellent, beginning with my favorite, the corn pudding. They offer a nice variety of specials and lunch options. If you have room for dessert you'll wanna try the best banana pudding in Charlotte, for real! It's so good and the touch of caramel is amazing. Definitely check them out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Just got back from trying City BBQ based upon a friend's recommendation.  My husband and I each ordered a pork sandwich with a side of slaw and fries.  Quick service, nice folks at the counter.  
We got our sandwiches and they looked very promising with a nice mixture of meat and burnt end pieces.  First bite was AWFUL and it went downhill from there.  The BBQ was soooo wet, almost mushy to eat.  Took several more bites and no better.  The meat had almost no smoke flavor, just wet and spongy.  We tossed both sandwiches in the trash.  

The hand cut fries were good.  The ice tea was delicious!  

We will not be going back ever.  Yuck...this was not good at all."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch the other day with my husband.  I was drooling before I even walked in the door! The smell of BBQ wafting through the air was delicious! I love that this place has lunch specials, its a much better deal then doing drive thru salad at Zaxbys. About the same price, but you are getting so much more food. I went with the pulled pork and potato salad and green beans. The pulled pork was great and the swine wine was to die for! I love spicy, vinegary BBQ sauce. The potato salad was good. I love a more mashed version of it. I didn't like the green beans. They were too mushy. I thought the service was great and appreciated the guy in the dining room coming over to pick up my dishes. I will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to order online to eat our bbq at home for a dinner and a movie type deal. We drove there and the employees were mostly rude. My boyfriend tried to tell them about the problem their online ordering system had and the guys response was \"yeah I'll get my IT guy right on that\". Our order was also supposed to be ready by 8pm and wasn't ready until 8:20. Meanwhile, the whole cook team was standing around laughing and joking. The bbq was more on the drier side. The sauce was delicious however and so was the sweet tea and banana pudding."}
{"text":"I have now been to this location a few times, and it's always a different experience.  I'm trying to figure out what's the norm?!  Service is all over, portion is all over....the only consistent thing is taste, which has been pretty good.

This is an order at the counter and sit kind of place- no servers.  They say your name, you pick it up and do the rest.  As others have said there's a huge condiment area with tons of BBQ sauces, pickles, onions, jalapeños and other things.  This is also where the silverware and to go boxes are.  This area has been messy on both visits.

I have tried  the pork, ribs, chicken and brisket.  All are good and have good flavor.  The consistency with portion is where the problem is regarding food.

The price is pretty consistent with local BBQ prices, but it's a bit less of an experience.  Until they get it down I'll have to say 3 out of 5."}
{"text":"Had lunch today order the lean brisket and it was  terrific had potato salad as a side was OK had a slight problem with change and they took care of it with tremendous professionalism no questions asked and I would gladly go back and gladly recommend this place the staff was very good and friendly food was good place was neat and clean and I think it's going to do well will definitely go back"}
{"text":"I'm so excited that City Barbecue has come to University City area of Charlotte. Located near the boardwalk and soon to be operating light rail, this BBQ spot will be very popular. This visit I had a chance to try several menu item. My favorites were a smoked turkey that was flavorful and juicy ( NOT DRY), savory corn pudding, and tender brisket. I also enjoyed the baked beans and smoked chicken. There are a variety of BBQ sauces to try and take home as well. I was also pleased to know that some non-pork/beef options are available during Lent, such as smoked salmon."}
{"text":"Six of went to City BBQ today for a late lunch.  We had a variety of items.  I had the 2 meat combo with 2 sides.  The sausage and brisket were both very good.  The sides of gumbo and Mac n cheese were also very good.   Everyone else was satisfied with their meals too."}
{"text":"This was the worst beef brisket I have ever had in my life.  The pork was almost as bad.  The smoked turkey was great.  If you are thinking Texas beef brisket don't eat here.  I didn't really like any of the sauces.  Probably won't be back.  The brisket was full of fat that was untrimmable.  There are many more places for great pulled pork as well."}
{"text":"Beware if you are ordering takeout, these guys will mess up your order half the time! Just picked up takeout and it's the second time this location has screwed up my order in the last month. The worst part is that I went there on a Sunday right when they opened and nobody else was in the restaurant, so it's not even like they were busy. If the manager is reading this, you MUST implement a procedure where the folks up front verify that the what the folks in the back filled was the correct order. And if you are ordering takeout from this place, check your order because I feel like a fool for getting burned twice by these guys and not checking before I left the restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. I enjoyed all the different BBQ sauces you can put on yourself but for the price not sure I want to have to get my own utensils and plates"}
{"text":"I have been to over 500 BBQ places in my life and never NEVER have I had such poor staff. Including the Manager! So here's my story and I am sticking with it.
1) Walk in to hostess stand  sign says \" please wait to be seated so I waited 10 minutes no one came.
2) There was  3 people at one table  2 people outside. I sat in the middle of the dinning room bright yellow shirt everyone  behind the counter saw me
3 ) Employees walked by me no one said nothing I finally stopped a young man I asked ? Are you working?
This is when it gets interesting!
4) He turns around 4 Times like  I caught him doing something he was not supposed to do.
5) I told him I had been mowing all day  no one came and I am really tired. So I said forget it walked outside with a s8 with full coverage never dropped a call. Called city bbq. The first lady young will call her \"I am doing my nails  she said 3 times can not hear you and hung up.
6) So I called back go some one else that connected me with a Mr ccccbbbvgc could not pronounce his name .Then a Manager came on with.( Do not bother me attitude)  I gave up."}
{"text":"I was in North Carolina so naturally BBQ is a must. I found City BBQ on yelp and decided to give it a go.  The place in Huntersville was nice and clean, the staff very pleasant. The only negative was I ordered a lunch special pulled bbq and was surprised at how small the helping was.  The potato salad was good, the creamy slaw kind of stringy. I tried a single rib and it was ok, not baby backs though. They had a great selection of BBQ sauces but I only had enough BBQ to only try 1.  I'd go back but I'll stay away from a lunch sized meal."}
{"text":"The food was really good and the place just feels good. Great atmosphere. It's new so it's spotless.   A must try ! Have to update this place from 4 to 5 stars. We have been back many times.  Consistently Great Food but tonight we saved room for desert. The Peach Cobbler is some next level stuff!!! Wow!"}
{"text":"Man, we were so looking forward to eating here.  But we came away a bit disappointed.   I've just never had brisket this greasy and fatty,  and i love fat but this was just too much.   The hush puppies were good, the vinegar coleslaw was really good, the creamy coleslaw was ok, the baked beans were ok, the corn bread had an odd texture and strange taste, and the loaded french fries were oddly spicy!  Look at my reviews,  im generally a pretty high grader so for me to give a 3 stars...well."}
{"text":"Decided to try this BBQ restaurant for lunch.  One orders at the counter, pick up food when called.
Crowded at lunch
Moderately prices as entrees come without sides, extra for one or 2  sides. Our smoked chicken with 2 sides  over $30 for lunch. Portions are large. There are lunch specials, less quantity and more reasonable priced.
Our smoked chicken was delicious, but not overly smokey, coleslaw standard recipe, baked beans with brisket yummy  but very sweet, and green  beans with bacon good. Staff is friendly and food came out quickly.
Standard menu with chicken, ribs, brisket, pulled pork, pulled chicken, smoked sausage, smoked turkey,  and sides  such as mac and cheese, potato salad, corn pudding, cornbread, green salad, etc.
Crafted beers, sodas and sweet tea etc plus standard fountain beverages.
Desserts such as banana pudding, cobblers, chocolate cake, cookies etc
They also cater.
Ambience comfortable, we would certainly return. 
On par with other quality BBQ places we have tried"}
{"text":"Not really impressed. Service was good. 
Pulled pork a little dry, and served pretty much luke warm to cold. Ordered fried okra as a side, under cooked, but they made a new batch for me when I brought it to their attention."}
{"text":"Full Disclosure: I am a barbecue snob and my ratings for BBQ restaurants are very critical.

5/5:  City Barbecue has the best pulled pork and beef brisket that I've eaten in the Charlotte area by an LARGE margin. Both meats were exceptionally tender, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. The pulled pork had a little bark included. I enjoyed both immensely.  

5/5:  Their collard greens were some of the very best that I've ever eaten. The pot likker in the collard greens was off the hook. There was a full serving of meat cooked in with the greens, the most that I've ever seen in a restaurant serving, and it was very much appreciated. 

3.75/5:  The mac 'n cheese didn't disappoint me either. 

4/5:  My piece of Texas toast was even delicious. 

5/5:  My drink of choice was a tasty Arnold Palmer that I mixed at the self serve drink station.

Total Cost was $20.32. This was a little on the expensive side for lunch, but it was totally worth it. The word that kept entering my mind after every bite was \"delicious.\"

The only thing that I found missing in the food department was a smoking HOT version of their barbecue sauce. I like hotter sauces on my brisket, but they did have SIX sauces to choose from. My favorites were the \"Swine Wine\" (traditional vinegar based) and the \"Carolina Soul\" (a Lexington based sauce.)

I noticed that peach cobbler and banana pudding were their everyday desserts. Both are excellent choices for a barbecue restaurant. 

DECOR:  There were two large screen tv's in the dining room, one with NFL football and one with LPGA golf. The decor was citified country, but I didn't mind. I noticed that there was a nice outside patio which would be great in the Spring and Fall. It was in the low 90's (F) today, so not so much in August. 

MUSIC:  Oh yeah, before I forget, the music that was playing non-stop was fantastic Memphis blues, which I dearly love....and especially in a barbecue restaurant. The two go together hand and glove. 

NEGATIVES:  All of the employees were very helpful and friendly with the exception of the young African-American girl at the register who clearly had issues with people of non-color. She was noticeably unwelcoming and standoffish. I spoke to her in a courteous and friendly manner, but she acted like it hurt her to speak to me. People with bad attitudes do not need to interact with the general public. Racism goes both ways people.

One other thing that surprised me was that their 8/16/17 sanitation rating was a surprisingly low 93.0%. The dining area looked spotless to me, although the barbecue sauce bottle lids were sticky. The most recent inspection showed FOUR critical demerits, the most surprising of which was an employee basically failing to wash their hands after handling their cell phone. https://public.cdpehs.com/NCENVPBL/INSPECTION/ShowESTABLISHMENTPage.aspx?ESTABLISHMENT=179730&esttst_cty=60

FINAL THOUGHTS:  I didn't notice their pickle/condiment bar until I was getting my \"to go\" refill, but it really didn't matter because I was totally stuffed. I would definitely eat here again on my travels to Fort Mill to buy adult beverages and inexpensive petrol."}
{"text":"BBQ pig good portion size. Nice variety of sauces from western NC to Eastern NC.Baked beans leaves something to be desired for. Greens good with Brisket chunks included. Order the Banana Pudding highly recommend.Wish they had table side wait staff standing in line to wait for your name to be called is not fun. Staff is fairly new but very present.  Interior and exterior seating, under cover and uncovered seating is available."}
{"text":"Food was awesome and friendly staff!  They aim to please!  Brisket, green beans, collards and hush puppies were all delicious!"}
{"text":"Was excited that City opened up in the university area.   I had been to their location in Ballantyne.   So we had an opportunity to visit this location.  

As usual the food was good.   I had the pulled pork with Mac and cheese and hush puppies.   My wife had the Brisket with the collards and corn pudding.   Good portions and good flavor.  We also tried the peach cobbler.   The cobbler was very sweet and a little bit of a let down.  

Overall I would repeat if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Erica is very pleasant, product knowledgeable and speedy service. My co worker has been here. We went that night since I'm newer to Charlotte. Great atmosphere and flavor variety with your sauces. I never tried collard greens since I'm from the West coast. Wow....your recipe is absolute yum. What a great dining concept you created."}
{"text":"Just got home from another amazing dining experience at City Barbeque. The staff here is a class act and we loved our meals. So much food and flavor. I had the pick 2 brisket and ribs. Honestly I should have bagged some to bring home, but I couldn't stop eating. It was so good. The house salad with the homemade apple cider vinaigrette was perfect. Always a pleasure to eat at City Barbeque. Today's weather had us searching for a place with outdoor seating and they're open patio did not dissappoint. Do not miss this place, and get that brisket! It is heaven."}
{"text":"Not exactly my kind of place to hang, but it is good for what it is. Festive barn kind of atmosphere, great place for kids.  The pulled meats are really good and the hand cut fries are divine. There is a corner in the restaurant that houses all the sauces. My favorite is the sauce with the ginger. So tangy and so tasty. I ate the salad with pulled turkey and cranberries. The dressing was an apple cider vinegarette, but I covered everything up with that ginger sauce!  Yum in the tum.  Very casual spot, just a bit too loud and frenetic for me.  I will actually probably return to the barn, mostly for that ginger stuff."}
{"text":"Born and raised in the Carolinas. Recently discovered City BBQ and it's by far my favorite of all time. You can tell with each sauce, side, or any bite you take that they take the time and effort to perfect their food. A+++"}
{"text":"Definitely not going back to Shane's!!!
City BBQ is amazing. This was the 1st time we've been & it did not disappoint. They were packed!!! That's a great sign. The staff was nice as well. Just go & experience the awesomeness:)"}
{"text":"Some of the best bbq i have ever eaten. The brisket is a must and the pork is freshly pulled along with a great variety of sauces."}
{"text":"I was pretty apprehensive about coming here due to the reviews and even suggested trying elsewhere instead but I am glad hubby talked me into giving it a shot.  Hubby, 8 year old daughter, and I ordered the city sampler with two extra sides and a peach cobbler.  All of it was good but the stand-out was their beef brisket.  It melted in my mouth, absolutely delicious.  Everyone was VERY friendly and we never felt ignored as others have stated.  

We went about 8pm on a Monday night, place wasn't dead but it wasn't packed either.  We ended up taking half the food home with us for lunch the next day because we were all stuffed.  When you factor that in it cost us about $6 a piece per meal.  Not too shabby!"}
{"text":"The ribs is too hard, not tender enough. The sauces  are good, staffs are friendly, and environment is clean. Briskets are tasty, and sides are fine. Would come back once in a while, but not my top choice for BBQ."}
{"text":"I saw this place being built when I was over across the street at Tony's Pizza so I decided to come try it out once it was completed. I had lunch with 7 friends the other day and all agreed the Food was Top of the line! If you order the Regular Lunch you'll get a ton of food so much that I took it home for another meal. The selection of choices are plentiful and the people working there were very nice and friendly, the building is New and nicely done with plenty of outdoor seating, it will be great in the summer. The only \"gripe\" we had was the noise level was pretty loud but then again it was Packed @ lunch so if you prefer quiet, eat outside. If you want a smaller portion for about $8 then order the Special between 11-3p and you'll be content. Do yourself a favor and check them out, you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"The food was very good. I had the turkey and corn pudding and the pudding was excellent. My only issue is the wait and they seemed to run out food. We had to wait 20 minutes for cornbread which came with the meal. We were just about done eating when we finally got the bread. They were also out of brisket and had to substitute other sides. Although I enjoyed the did I would suggest going early in the day to make sure they have everything in the menu available."}
{"text":"The barbecue is average the sides are too some of the sauces are tasty however my main issues was the price for quality the sides aren't included unless you order a certain amount of meat which is a drag because everything here is average"}
{"text":"Very good beef brisket and chicken. Great dessert-like hushpuppies. Good sides. 

The desserts will put you into a sugar coma( the banana pudding and especially the peach cobbler) . Sickeningly sweet. Did not enjoy the desserts.

Everything else was tasty."}
{"text":"I ordered the half slab of ribs, baked beans, and fried okra. For $20 im not impressed by any of it. The ribs are ok. The fried okra is heavily salted to the point it can give you a headache and the baked beans just taste like beans drowned in a bottle of BBQ sauce. There is no depth of flavor at all. How about onions? Green peppers? Nope...just bbq sauce. It's is a so so dining experience for me and I probably will not come back here."}
{"text":"City BBQ, only in name, as this place is producing BBQ you might expect to only find out in the country.  I understand this place is a chain of sorts but don't let that stop you from giving them a chance.  The turkey especially is perfectly smoked and moist, my favorite thing here.  The sides are solid, oddly the fries are probably their best offering, perfect natural cut fries.  The pork is decent, the brisket is 8/10 and I love the sausage, fresh, nice snap and tons of flavor.  In case you couldn't tell we got the sampler plate :).  Maybe my favorite part of this place is the sauce bar.  They have about 15 different bbq sauces you can try with pickles, onions and jalapeños on the bar too!   A solid local beer selection rounds out a really nice experience here at city bbq.  Good for families, food for couples, really good for everyone."}
{"text":"After reading all these reviews I was expecting for it to be a lot better than what I received. The service was excellent but the food wasn't great. The mac and cheese wasn't special. It was good but not great. The chicken was disgusting. It was pink inside. The BBQ sauce was really good tho."}
{"text":"This is truly one of my favorite places! The food and staff are always OUTSTANDING!! The staff knows me by name and they are always going above and beyond to ensure im satisfied! Anything on the menu is GREAT!!! Trust me everything is great!!!"}
{"text":"Omg ! I love this place ! This was the first time giving it a try the people there were helpful and nice the atmosphere was chill and inviting. 
The food was great for the price I paid $10 for the lite  lunch special which is available till 3 pm. a leg and thigh with two sides and a Texas toast and ... a drink . Great deal.  
I also really liked the sauces there since I'm a sauce type of person . I will totally come back again"}
{"text":"Pretty good BBQ. Food portions are generous, the restaurant is clean and the service is great! They even have a little table for the kids to play...props as a parent! Oh and the banana pudding is really really good..."}
{"text":"They never contacted me from headquarters so they DO NOT CARE if they messed up or if customers are upset"}
{"text":"Ladies and gentlemen, I kid you not. I have travelled from the mountains of Appalachia to the shores of the Atlantic in search of the best barbecue this side of the Mississippi. I always root for the little mom and pop places that depend on referrals for their living and utilize recipes handed down from generations of bbq'ers but today I am here to sing the praises of.. I hesitate to say.. a chain restaurant.
Twice now I have visited this chain in two different locations to assure that is not just a fluke and I am happy to report that I have not been disappointed!
The creamy slaw is heavenly even though it is thick cut Carolina slaw, the bbq brisket beans are sweet as molasses and are choc full of brisket.
The sausage is pleasant but not too spicy, the brisket is lean and tender and for the first time tonight I tried the pulled chicken and was very pleasantly surprised. The turkey is incredible and quite possibly the best you'll have this side of thanksgiving dinner. There are more sauces to mop up these sinuous delicacies than you can shake a proverbial stick at.
The service was incredibly friendly and welcoming. I can't stress how important it is nowadays to walk into a joint and feel welcomed. The wait time for our food was nearly nonexistent which is a definite plus if you find yourself visiting for a short lunch break.
If you find yourself in the vicinity, do yourself a solid and stop by. They definitely will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Very good quality meat and full of flavor. Make sure you try the sausage. Also really enjoyed the sweet potato casserole side. Service was excellent and very accommodating- they even overheard my family saying I get cold easily and turned on the heat for me. Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Very good. Good portions. I got the beef brisket, baked beans and potato salad. All of them were tasty. The only thing would change is how they package to-go orders. They put everything in separate containers instead of plating it, but that's just my personal preference. All and all, I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Decided to check out the new City BBQ location in University. We're excited that with the light rail coming in that so many things could potentially be coming in. Had the brisket and pulled pork, both were solid. There were so many sauces to choose from, I tried just a few. Brush fire and Spice ginger. Both were good, and I'm looking forward to trying more. We picked up the banana pudding dessert as we left, yet to try that as of this revuew, but looked good. Very excited to have a decent BBQ joint nearby, even if its a 'chain'."}
{"text":"Excellent pulled pork BBQ and a range of sauce options make this a terrific place for a quick lunch. But be prepared to eat since the portions are big. The sides are true Southern - great fried okra - but the Mac and cheese is gluey and overdone. Prompt service and a fun atmosphere. Kid friendly. Will definitely recommend to my friends!"}
{"text":"Been here several times. Today was big disappointment. Cashier refused to honor a coupon because of a \"system issue\".  Pulled chicken portion was minuscule and the rubbery.  At least it was hot, unlike the side of greens which were lukewarm at best. Green beans were warmer and edible.  Dinning room was also disappointing with several dirty tables and debris on the floor. Won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"5 Stars for the deals. 
4 stars on the sides. I don't have to have the mac and cheese, the beans and the gumbo is thicker than you'd expect while the rice has a crunch. I wasn't sure if it was brown rice so it'd have a bite or undercooked. Eithervway, the meats is where it's all at (food wise). 

The deals is where it's at (non food wise)

Rib Tuesday isn't just 40% off your order but 40% off 1 rib and you have to order them individually versus a slab.

They give center cut and without prompting which is nice. 

The brisket chili is Worth it. 
This location uses a smaller cup whereas Matthews will put the chili in the bowl size (guessing here) buy it's black. 

Online ordering is simple enough. Earn and redeem points via the app. 

Workers we just as polite and attentive. Brisket, ribs, collard greens are what I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Finally made it to City BBQ and it didn't let us down. I had the pork sandwich with fries and wife had the chicken fingers.  Sandwich had plenty of meat and it was very good. Wife enjoyed her chicken fingers too. Place was clean and service was friendly. Only issue is that it is a little more expensive than the other BBQs since a side order is not included but we will return soon anyway."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat. Well I haven't actually eaten there because we always get the food to go but OMG!!! I go into a food coma every time. The staff are so polite and the food is amazing. Nothing I have tried has let me down. Plan to visit plenty more."}
{"text":"Good barbecue and even greater people working there. Everyone looked like they really enjoy their job. We went right in the middle of lunch rush but only waited 10 minutes for our food. So when you arrive, you walk in and order your food then you take your seat. When they're busy you may have to send out a \"seat scout\" while you wait for your meal. We had the big Judges sampler with mac & cheese and hush puppies as the sides. Skip the mac & cheese. Everything else was spot on. Ribs tender and tasty. Chicken smoky and flavorful. Brisket and pulled pork very good. Beware however... the full cut brisket looks a lot like the pulled pork so don't think that they forgot to give you your brisket like I did! All in all a great BBQ place and a very good experience!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed... This is our go to barbecue joint, we come here almost bi weekly. However, we just stepped foot in there for dinner and the bathrooms were horribly disgusting. Their recent sanitation record as of Yesterday was a 93 on a scale of 100. Food is great, however wont be coming back here due to their dirty restaurant--- how gross! Yuck! Way to lose a customer!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out on the web. It was ready quickly and our service at the pick up was great. Friendly and helpful. We got two sample platters and all the sauce and sides. Everything was fantastic."}
{"text":"I attended a soft open for this new City BBQ location.  They rolled out the red carpet for us and i was able to try most of the menu.  We have a lot of quality BBQ in CLT, so I'm not easily impressed.  I have to say, i was very pleased with all the items we tried.  

You can tell the employees here know the in's and outs of BBQ prep and it tells in the flavors of the meats!  Don't get me wrong, i love sauces, and they have some really tasty ones (the Piedmont has some kick!) but all the proteins can stand alone! The Brisket was my favorite, hands down, great smoky flavor.   I'm not a huge sausage fan, but i really enjoyed theirs.  I can't wait to try a pulled pork sandwich, because i only tried the pork with their vinegar slaw snd it was really solid! Ribs were good and their smoked Turkey should make a great sandwich! 

Speaking of sandwiches, i can't wait to try their More Cowbell: Beef Brisket, topped with peppers, smoked provolone, onions and creamy horseradish sauce piled high on Texas toast!

On to the sides!  For starters, i take pride in always ordering potato salad at BBQ joints.  I've had  some bad ones and some good one's.....their 100 year old recipe is one of the best i've ever had! The greens were really good, Baked Beans solid.  I can't wait to try this corn pudding they serve.  

For dessert, they gave us their Banana Pudding.  It was delicious!  They put a little caramel drizzle on it, which mixes really well!  

Friendly staff!  The manager has been in the restaurant business for 30 years.  I think this is a perfect location for the Matthews neighborhood!"}
{"text":"More Cowbell no bun. Great horseradish sauce. Added spicy sauce. Slaw, citrus slaw and collards all excellent. Gave me a first time discount. They were empty when I went at 2pm and they were very friendly and helpful. Will be getting this a lot."}
{"text":"After so many rave reviews of this place, mine wit be a little more grounded. 

I stopped here for lunch to see what City Barbecue was all about. This is not a table service bbq joint. It's BBQ fast casual. You order at the counter, give them your name, go get your drink, silverware, condiments, etc, find a seat and they call your name. You clean up after yourself.

I went with the Pick 2 option with brisket and pulled pork. I added a drink and a side of Mac n cheese. This came to $19.24. Ouch.

The waiting was minimal. Along with everything I ordered, they also gave me 3 side samples of corn casserole, green beans something I couldn't figure or what but it had rice on the bottom. 

First off, the side samples were all unappetizing and looked like they were either canned or cooked too long or both. The taste was kind of meh as well. This taste continued with the Mac n cheese. The meats were tender, especially the brisket which is what they apperently shine with. The pork had no real flavor. 

I tried 4 of their sauces and all I would consider thick - gravy like thick. I think it was Burnside that I liked the best but I couldn't get over the sweetness and the thickness of all of them. 

I can't say I am a fan of this place. But then it's a chain, and not even based in the Carolinas. This is a chain based in Ohio. And that right there explains the blandness and the gravy like sauces. 

If you want good bbq, there are plenty of locally owned places around worthy of your $$. Try Midwood Smokehouse, McCoys or Queen City Q. But come here if you want a step up from Other chains like Sonny's. I'm sure all of the above are cheaper as well. 

So overall a 2 star place. The brisket was worth the 3rd star."}
{"text":"Gluten Free- Yes
Casein Free - Yes

I have to laugh that whenever I asked for recommendations for a good BBQ place to eat at in town,City BBQ kept popping up.  I find this funny because City BBQ is not only chain restaurant, but it started out in Ohio of all places, so I'm extremely familiar with them. 

What makes them 5 Stars? Simple, service, food, and price.

+ Service - Extremely friendly and helpful. When ordering and letting them know of my dietary constraints, the person doing the ordering will alert the people preparing my order of my allergies. What that means is that 1. all gloves are changed and 2. if I'm ordering meat, they will use a new piece that hasn't been touch before, especially for the brisket.

+ Food - It's fresh and filling because pretty much everything as meat in it. The sides included. A major chuck of the menu is GFCF. Just as for the allergen menu when in doubt.


+Price - For the quality and quantity, it great and won't break your budget or expense account. I mean you could order the side platter, where you pick 3 sides, and a drink and walk out the door for under $10 and a full stomach.  


Tips:
*They can have a long line at lunch;however, the line moves quickly and you will have your order in no time. Seating inside can become a bit crowed as well. They do have additional seating outside under a covered porch. 

*If you dine often, download their app to earn free food.

*The sweet tea is dangerously good, just beware of the sugar rush and crash afterwords."}
{"text":"I have been here three times now and all have been good experiences. The food is good and it all seems slightly overpriced just a little bit. But one of the new up-and-coming chains I think. They do have a nice patio! Will be back."}
{"text":"Happened to venture here after spending some time exploring the Botanical Gardens at UNCC.  

First, I am going to review the food.  The food was good, not great.  I am a big BBQ fan so it takes a lot to impress me with BBQ.  The green beans and hush puppies were really good!  Seasoned just right and hot!  The mac and cheese was good, not great.  Also, the BBQ was good but not great.  It was lukewarm and I like BBQ to be warm to hot.  The sauces were really good with my favorite being the \"swine wine\" and the mustard sauce!

Now, the service.  The service here was pretty dang awesome!  Loren greeted us at the register and took our orders.  She was pretty amazing!  Her display of customer service was top notch and we were really impressed!  It is always great to see someone in hospitality love their job and enjoy doing it!  She is a true asset to this company!"}
{"text":"Not very good for dinner- possibly a nice quick lunch spot. Kind of off by itself - would not recommend to go out of your way to go there."}
{"text":"Just passing by on I 77 South heading back to Atlanta, We didn't want to go far off of the main road. It's a mile off of 77 and it had a great review. We love barbecue so we decided to try it. We weren't disappointed by any means. All of the meats were fantastic, and the sides were great!!If you're anywhere in the area it's a must try."}
{"text":"The BEST BBQ in Charlotte. Real Texas Brisket, REAL (Not NC Style) Pulled Pork....but the one reason why you should RUN to this place is for the Collard Greens! Best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Good solid BBQ served quick enough for a lunch break or chill enough to bring your family and baby. 

The food is great and staff is super nice and helpful. Right now the parking is good but I can see it being a pain as soon as two more businesses start up adjacent to City BBQ. Parking in the shopping areas in this part of town is terrible because they squeeze these parking lots in with too many shops. Try parking at the Starbucks nearby it's terrible. Anyway City rocks though, I'd come back and sample more meat treats. Yes it's pricey but it's real local BBQ that doesn't skimp on quality. All the bbq sauces are great and don't be afraid to try the Habanero Peach sauce, it's nice and not too hot."}
{"text":"Don't go to late they ran out of pork, but made it right with Chocolate Cake!!The brisket was really good! The ribs were my favorite with \"bama sauce\" The service was fantastic! I'm glad we have City Bar-B-Que in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"I really love the food here it truly deserves a 5 star rating, however I'm not sure if because it's new and extremely busy that things just happen. But I seem to have issues with communication when it comes to me getting exactly what I ask for. I visited this past Sunday ordered a good bit of food bought something for my grams didn't check didn't think I needed to because my order was repeated to me before it was bagged. So I took it to her she saved it and ate it Monday. I asked how it was yesterday she said she had her mouth set for a good BBQ pulled pork sandwich and didn't get that at all. I said well what do you mean? She said the sandwich wasn't a pork sandwich it was a chicken breast. I said well I'm so sorry but I'll make it right for you. Moral of the story always check your food and I normally do but they have it packed tight and it was crowded but I won't do that again."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in town the barbecue is fantastic. We had turkey and it was the most tender I have ever had. wonderful. Sides were delicious. Bring your appetite, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The brisket is insanely delicious.  We ordered the brisket and pork belly sandwich, and although the pork was good the brisket was better.  The potato salad, fries and okra were all good, though the collard greens were quite salty."}
{"text":"Very good BBQ pricey but good. Don't like Pepsi though but they really need to clean their utensils better I had to give back their silverware and use plastic.pretty good for a first time.

Was just here and after ordering went to get a large drink. 2.49 plus tax and can only drink Diet Coke or Pepsi. They were out of diet and told me they were gonna fix it. My granddaughter went up and asked and they said didn't have anymore. Would have been nice to post a note on the soda fountain l. By the time I got refund on drink and got a water cup the food was cold.  Is this normal for city bbq?

Excellent customer service from all involved 
Had dinner last night they made up for last time very well. Good job. 
Best customer service in the area!!!"}
{"text":"Went yesterday. Seems like the PM crew doesn't care my pulled chicken \"bunned\" was cold and our cheese n bacon fries were cold too. When we took the cheese fries back up to the counter she acted like we was wrong when they just called our number 2 minutes ago. Probably won't give them another try."}
{"text":"The food here is exactly the way I want it to be.  I really enjoy the flavor, portions, and the price.  This place has hit the trifecta in my opinion.  The downside is that Google Maps hasn't really figured out how to properly give directions to this place.  Don't worry the Google will figure it out eventually.

This location has plenty of seating both indoors and outdoors.  The place is brand spanking new so everything is all clean and shiny.  I really think you should give this place a try and order a few things off the menu.  I am always a sucker for the brisket, but the chicken here is cooked right.  Not dry at all, which is a common problem when you get chicken.  Places like to play it safe and overcook the chicken, but City Barbeque has confidence in their cooking skills and cooks the chicken safely and savory."}
{"text":"Great BBQ the food was great but the customer service and friendly staff go above and beyond anything I've ever experienced. I felt like I was treated like royalty. Randomly looked for BBQ while stuck in traffic. Sometimes things just work out. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I give it 3.5 stars - really nice order and sit down place. Clean and the staff is very friendly. The kitchen is open so you can see the staff pull your meat fresh. Very good meat, I had the choose two and got pork and brisket. The brisket was the better of the two, great flavor and has a distinct smoke ring and the bark seasoning is great. Collard greens are good, a little on the salty side but has big pieces of pork in it for good flavor. I wouldn't order the beans again, but maybe just what I prefer. I'm not a fan of sweet bbq beans and I actually think they cook them in their sweet bbq sauce. There is brisket in the beans and it gets pretty tough from long term cooking. 

There are 3 reasons that keep me from giving 4 or 5 stars. First, my pork was over half of fat and my brisket was about 1/4 of fat. When I finished, the leftover fat put together could have been a pretty decent sandwich if it were meat. Second, which is not a huge deal, but they have about 6 bbq sauces and don't explain what they are. So I just went out on a limb and chose the Original and Brushfire. The Original was thick and sweet which went better on the brisket and Brushfire was better on the pork which was a little spicy, thinner and had vinegar. I would have tried the others but since they looked similar I didn't know if I should have taken the \"risk\". Lastly, their sides aren't included with the entrees so everything is basically a la carte. I could understand ordering just a sandwich and paying more for sides but for a $14-22 entree, I believe sides should be included, not $3.29. My opinion though.

Overall, I would go back and I'm not too upset about having so much fat as it may vary based on who is making plates that day. If a manager is reading this, I would recommend having the person doing the plates trim the fat a little. If I had to compare it to something I'd say the atmosphere of Shane's Rib Shack with the food quality of a family BBQ place."}
{"text":"My experience here was not great. I will admit the customer service was great when I first ordered. My problem was not with the staff, but with the food. The food that I got was not good. I don't know if this is usual for this restaurant, but the beef brisket cut that I got was so incredibly fatty. There was more fat than meat. The corn pudding while tasty was only lukewarm. The green beans also tasted like they were from a can rather than fresh. I've had really good barbecue in Charlotte. This was just not one of them. This is the place I won't be going back to which is a shame because it's very close. I also thought they were extremely overpriced for the food that I received."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see them build one by my house. I couldn't wait to experience the BBQ. Being a barbecue connoisseur from my home state of Alabama and have eaten barbecue all over the country I was really excited. When I finally got there I was expressed with the atmosphere and the staff was absolutely down home friendly. However the ordering from the menu was quite confusing but the staff was very patient with me and walked me through the process. Everything is ala carte so remember if you want fries to order them. When our food finally arrived which was very quick I was ready to dive in. The meat was succulent however the flavor was less than lackluster. There wasn't an obvious smoke taste to the meat and the sauces though they were good just didn't Elevate the meats taste. Their desserts weren't the best either. The chocolate cake was dry and the banana pudding was just ok. However, the manger was the most pleasant person to talk with and the history of the company was amazing to hear."}
{"text":"I was able to visit City Barbeque for a Yelp Event and it was fabulous! We were told to come hungry and I'm glad we did, we ate SO MUCH. The highlights were the following:

1. Baked beans: Creamy and extremely flavorful with chunks of pork inside. Have never been a fan of baked beans but these were outstanding!
2. Turkey: Who knew a barbecue joint could nail plain old turkey? It was so juicy, I will DEFINITELY be back for this.
3. Banana pudding: I could bathe in this stuff. There were chunks of bananas and wafers and it was slathered in caramel. The homemade whipped cream topping was the cherry on top. Oh my heavens.
4. Hushpuppies: Crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside. What more could you want?

Of course the pulled pork, brisket, and ribs were delicious as well! But it was great to find a barbecue place that nails everything else too. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Ridiculously good food. Got the lunch pulled pork special which is a smaller sandwich but very tasty. Two full size sides - which combined with the sandwich - is more than enough for a good sized appetite. Super friendly people and UNC Charlotte themed, which I like a lot. REALLY GLAD THAT THEY ARE SO CLOSE TO CAMPUS!"}
{"text":"The whole family loved their meals and asked for more. Recommend the Cowbell and not just to hear them ring the bell. Very friendly and clean place."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with the fam (4 young kids and hubby). Customer service was great and super friendly. Food was delicious too- we got a family meal to share with a variety of meats and sides. Great first impression."}
{"text":"I'm from the \"if there's no smoke coming from the building, it's not real\" school of BBQ. Regardless, I passed by the City BBQ in Ballentyne and decided to stop in. The place was clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. I got a rib plate and a couple of sides to go and was not disappointed. The rib meat was tender and fell off the bone although their sweet sauce is bit too sweet for me; I'll have to check out their other choices. 
Two of their sides stand out for me; the corn pudding and the gumbo. While the corn pudding looks like it's made from leftover cornbread, it's a sweet, thick side that is very tasty. Think bread pudding but yellow with kernels of corn scattered about. The gumbo was a surprise; slightly spicy and savory and served on white rice. It's become my go to side dish.
Their 1/2 chicken was just ok; it had a slight aftertaste that turned me off. I'd probably not order that again which is a shame because bbq or smoked chicken is a staple for me at other places. The brisket was very good. Brisket is one of those things that has to be served or stored in a way so that it stays moist and tender. I've taken the brisket home a couple of times and each time it was moist and delicious.....except for the last time. 
If you order the brisket, take a look at it when they bring it to you. It should come in strips or big pieces. My last to go order of brisket consisted of one strip and a pile of small, crumbly pieces that came from the end or was left over. It was literally a small pile of meat kibble. Would you pay full price for a shirt that had a defect? No and City BBQ shouldn't serve scraps and charge you for it. Very disappointed about that. 
That's what took it from 4 stars to 3; the people are fine but you're there for the Q. Don't serve scraps."}
{"text":"I've ordered their ribs to go before and gotten them in a sleeve meant to fit the whole rack. This time, when I opened the bag, I got a bunch of individual, loose ribs. When you order a whole rack, they (usually) give you an entire rack; hence the sleeve. These were dry and not as good as usual; probably some leftovers. It's a shame because, since BBQ isn't cheap, you shouldn't be getting dry leftovers."}
{"text":"We have eaten at City BBQ twice since it opened. The food and service have definitely improved in the past few weeks. We took our friends from California there on Saturday night for authentic local bbq. They shared the city sampler and loved everything on the large plate: pulled pork, brisket, chicken and a few burnt ends. They were not thrilled with the vinegar-y NC sauce, but they were adventurous and tried it. However, there were four additional sauces for them to try, so they enjoyed the sweet sauce. Others in our party had the pulled pork sandwich with slaw. There was a choice of vinegar dressing or creamy, but we chose creamy. It was delicious. The cornbread was good and the hush puppies solidly tasted of onion as they should. All tables in the place were filled so there was a bit of a lag in cleaning tables so others could sit."}
{"text":"My parents always rave about city bbq.  There isn't one near my house so when my sister and I were visiting them we decided to pick it up for lunch.

We called in the order and everything was accurate and we had all our sauces and dressings .  The staff was really friendly and helpful. 

I wanted something healthier for lunch because I knew I was eating pizza for dinner.  I was surprised that city bbq publishes their nutrition and have some healthy options!  I got the smokehouse turkey salad and it was huge and delicious.  The turkey was really good.

For the rest of my family we got a large bbq platter with three sides, okra, baked beans, and hush puppies.  We also got a bbq sandwich and fries.  

We ordered a cobbler to split for dessert.  Everything was wonderful.  We will definitely be back, especially so I can try the bbq!"}
{"text":"Loving this new local NC barbecue house in south Charlotte's Ballantyne district.   I am having a LoLo barbecue with side of hushpuppies and corn chowder/pudding.   For desert, peach cobbler.   Simple register order / pickup style service, nice look and feel to dining room.   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Plenty of people do not like chains, no matter where they originate, and that is okay. This means that a decent portion of the population will cross City off of their list simply for those reasons, which could be a mistake. While I have not visited every City location, the ones I have been to have made a nice effort to become a part of their community. Can't say that about McDonalds (or even homegrown chains, for that matter).

So as you sidle - and I don't know that I sidle correctly, for that matter - up to the counter, you'll meet a friendly cashier, who can help you through their menu, which is actually a bit necessary, because it can be intimidating. It's a shame, really, because there is a lot to like on the menu. It's even worse, because some of the best things on the menu are even better when you get off the menu. For instance, the sliced brisket is good, but if you get the brisket chopped instead, and it adds in the flavor of the fat and the burnt ends? Amazing. You just have to ask for it. You can also get a taste of about anything, I believe.

Once you have ordered, you find a table and then have to hope you hear them call your name, which can be a challenge. The \"grab a number and have it delivered\" method might be a better option - even stranger is that they seem to have numbers, but you are still expected to pick it up yourself, so I'm not really sure why it isn't done that way. Once seated, the actual food is good, but the meat is the star here - sides are hit and miss, so just stick to the meat and you'll be golden.

Now I realize that a lot of folks do not eat meat, and this is of course fine. But if you're craving something with a bit more bite than those alfalfa sprouts, you know where to go."}
{"text":"I first came here for a yelp event and really enjoyed my experience but this time I came with the hubs and a friend for dinner. They have a great menu for everyone. Me and my husband decided to get the city sampler and split it. There is enough meat for the both of us. It came with texas toast and two side items. We got collard greens and macaroni and cheese and added on potato salad. The meat was cooked well and was flavorful and fresh. My favorite was the brisket. My husband loved the turkey. The macaroni came a few mins after the food which was not a problem because it was soooo good and hot!! I loved the potato salad too!!

They have a great selection of sauces for everyone. They also have onions and pickles. The sweet tea is also good. 

We had a great time here and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nice casual place, food looked good but strangely lacked flavor. I only had sides--fried okra, cole slaw (vinegar slaw was oily) and corn pudding. My husband had ribs and said they were good. We ordered the peach cobbler, which had very few peaches and was too sweet to eat. We threw out more than we ate. Won't be back."}
{"text":"New BBQ to open this Saturday the 17th. I was invited tonight for their special event before their grand opening . Their staff is very well trained on their whole menu I was very impressed.  They let you order anything which was great it wasn't a selected menu this a great idea all places should do this before opening Kudos:) They have lots of southern sides green beans which were really good. They have fried Okra , collards , baked beans an Mac an cheese. They have Brisket which they were out of tonight no surprise I'm sure it was amazing . I had the pulled pork , 1/4 chicken white . The BBQ was on point nice smokey flavor. I didn't use any sauce they have several flavors to choose from .  I didn't care for the collards they were very salty I think it was the Bbq mixed in I'd suggest leave that out . They do have fresh cut fries excellent choice. I did try the fried I like fried okra fried hard but this had a good breading but the Okra to me wasn't really done but some people like it that way. I didn't try the Mac n cheese I'm a southern girl I know my Mac n cheese . I always ask if it's home made an sad to say a lot of places go cheap to cut cost an use that powder cheese . I asked the young lady at the counter an she said it's not really home made n has that powder. I'd just assume that be taken off the menu honey or let me in there an show you to make home made baked mac n cheese:) all in all I think this new BBQ place will do great . It's actually in the Publix parking lot easy to find. I did try their chocolate cake I can't brag enough it's almost like a devils food very moist with a chocolate icing an chocolate mini morsels. They were out of peach cobbler bummer but they also have Banana Pudding now they make it there on site but it has a twist to it. It's not your southern Pudding it's a little crunchy not vanilla wafers an cool whip an the have Carmel in it. Not for me but some folks might like that . Cute atmosphere an a nice outdoor seating the prices are right on target . I was told they also make their own fresh squeezed lemonade yum. Check them them an make them feel at home here in Charlotte ."}
{"text":"If you park at University Place and get out of the car, you'll be sucked in by the smell.

Service was friendly, helpful and fast.

Pulled chicken is amazeballs. Moist and tossed in the white sauce for the lazy folk. Do not skip the okra. Perfectly breaded and juuuuuuust right. Collards were respectable. 

Skip the brisket unless you like it dry and flavorless. 

DH liked the pork but it is big chunks.

A zillion sauces to select from-the Asian was a surprise favorite!

We will be back because frankly, we need the banana pudding after stalking it at another table."}
{"text":"As always, City BBQ is so phenomenal. They always give such great service, and this location is no different. The food is always delicious. The portions are huge. I would recommend the pulled pork and chicken. The corn pudding is to die for. There is a BBQ sauce for everyone. Try the lemonade and sweet tea, they are homemade and delightful."}
{"text":"I have been such a fan of City BBQ since attending a few Yelp events here. They are a fantastic company with great employees and I love supporting their business. Literally everything is so delicious, with the exception of two things: the greens are too salty and the mac and cheese is too artificial. Other than that, I am obsessed with the pulled pork, brisket, ribs, and chicken. These people do meat justice! The sides are great and I especially love the corn pudding! The banana pudding is also to die for. They have generous portions and they will let you try anything before ordering which is always much appreciated. I will definitely be back here many times to come for the great location and staff!"}
{"text":"If you think the best barbecue is usually found in the worse part of town, in a place with    bars on the windows and just enough grease on the table to write your initials, then you'd be wrong.

And you'd be wrong again if you think you can't find good cue in a  stand alone brick building in a shopping center complex in Charlotte.

The place is City Barbecue; and while this guy who has spent a lifetime in pursuit of the perfect barbecue is not ready to shout, \"this is it,\" - it is pretty darn good.

What's also surprising is that \"it\" is part of a  regional chain.  No franchisees, all company owned, and each \"joint\" doing everything from  cutting the fries to rubbing the brisket at their own location.

The Brown Shoe Gourmet has enjoyed barbecue (some a lot more than others) from Times Square to San Diego and written Yelp reviews for more than 90 'Cue stops and doesn't give five stars but to a select few  but City Barbecue in Charlotte has now been added to the list.  And here's why:

Their brisket is just a quarter inch short of the brisket at Righteous Barbecue in Marietta , Georgia, and an eight of an inch shy of  the gold standard set by Luling City Market Barbecue and Blacks Barbecue just south of Austin, Texas, where it's all about brisket.  Enough smoke in the flavor so you know it was cooked low and slow over hickory; moist so you know that thin layer of layer of fat was left on for flavor, juicy and tender so you know that they really did smoke it for14, 15 or 16 hours at somewhere around 200.

While the brisket is the best item on the City Barbecue menu, the ribs, chicken and pork are all in competition for runner-up.   Folks who don't know any better, often boast about the meat falling off the bone when they have ribs.  If the meat is falling off the bone, that means it was either par boiled, baked or under the heat lamp too long. Good ribs (they feature  St. Luis cut) require you pick 'em up, get sauce all over your fingers and munch away.

The chicken was crisp on the outside, moist and tasting very good inside. One at our table said it was the best they ever had.  The Pork was a tad on the dry side. Good flavor, but maybe too close to closing.  And with the platters, two small loaves of delicious cornbread. Life is good.

A couple of the sides are killers. Hand cut fries and a super tangy vinegar slaw. Baked beans were  like a lot of others. Did not try the corn pudding, Mac and cheese, or green beans with bacon. Next time.

Sauces? Six of them. Fellow we guessed was the manager, Shane Wolfe, gave us the rundown. Here's our take on them: Not all great, but then sauces are a matter of taste, pun intended. For mine, their \"swine wine,\"  was excellent: vinegar based, some flecks of red pepper - just right for the pulled pork. Their sweet sauce was too; the mustard based was roughly average; their \"brush fire\" was good if you like hot, and City Barbecue's \"original\" was right on for the ribs and chicken.

If you  read the walls on the way to the restrooms, you'll see that the founders, like the Brown Shoe Gourmet, have made various barbecue tours seeking to savor 'cue at the meccas of this all-American food group. There are pictures of them at Abe's in Clarksville, Arthur Bryants and Oklahoma Joe's in Kansas City, Luling in Texas - all of which we've visited and reviewed as well.  

Shane also made sure we didn't check out without checking out a super chocolate desert cake and a world class banana pudding - topped with sliced bananas and caramel. Don't leave without trying and probably sharing.

Barbecue is a hard food to replicate without losing character and quality... anyone remember Famous Dave's? Sonnys? Slopes in Atlanta? And the list goes on... but City Barbecue, coming out of the world renown barbecue State of Ohio, is doing it right... and it is good;very. 

Five Stars and we'll be back next time in Charlotte."}
{"text":"They are a great barbecue restaurant. Their food is very good, their service is prompt ant the restaurant is clean. Their carry out is very good also. We will continue to eat there and use their
takeout service"}
{"text":"First time trying this place for a quick family dinner on a Wednesday night. Our family loves BBQ and is always looking for consistent and great quality locations in our city. This was not it. First, I do not understand the 'ala carte ordering in a casual BBQ joint. Basic entrees range from $6- $14, but only include the meat? You can add two sides for an additional $4, or purchase individual sides. Odd, again for the type of restaurant this is. I ordered the 1/4 smoked dark chicken, collards and mac and cheese. Next to the meat, the sides- especially mac and cheese- are most important players in any BBQ eatery.This mac and cheese, was NOT adult mac and cheese, but rather, a minor step up from boxed cheesy mac. In other words, my four year old loved it, me and my husband, not so much. The collards were good...maybe a tab overloaded with pulled pork-- some people really look for that, so its not a horrible thing. My chicken was okay- not amazing, not terrible. So, with the  other BBQ options here in Charlotte, this will likely not be a spot that I hastily return to. At best, I may give it a second chance and try different menu items. My husband said his ribs were good, but again, not amazing."}
{"text":"Pretty good everything. We tried the city sampler with ribs, chicken, brisket and sausage. The mac and cheese was good too. And how could i forget the delicious texas toast! My first time and would def go back. Food came out quick."}
{"text":"More Cowbell please!!! The Beef Brisket is always so good. The brisket is topped with peppers and provolone cheese on Texas Toast. You also can't go wrong with the St Louis ribs. The meat falls of the bone and with so many great sides, you always leave really really full:)"}
{"text":"While in Charlotte, we had to have barbeque... So my in laws wanted us to check out City Barbeque since they eat at this location often. Off we went, City Barbeque is located in a big shopping center, easy to spot frm the main road, has a big parking lot, the place was mostly empty when we got there.

My father in law couldn't take advantage of their rewards program (as a regular customer), it didn't work well, so he couldn't use a coupon they promised. That's always a bummer. Maybe they should have been more helpful and also make the program simpler.

We got pulled pork sandwiches, which where good, slaw, hush puppies (very good, my favorite part of the meal) and mac and cheese (just OK).

 The issue with this place is that even if it's a restaurant, you kinda have to do it all yourself. Get your plates, utensils, sauces (they have a station further from tables). I did enjoy my Carolina mustard sauce, open your beer bottle - got the local brew- Olde Mecklenburg - Amber Ale. We were told to go to some area to open the bottles, had a hard time finding the opener. They can't even open a beer bottle for you, here? At the table with sauces for BBQ  they had another station - with pickles, onion, etc. I really liked their pickles, got my fix, nice and sour.

Customer service was sloppy, they didn't seem to care or be helpful. Same in the restrooms- the ladies one didn't have toilet paper, the men's restroom didn't have paper towels.

The food is OK, but this place should improve their customer service and put less on the customers. It's too hands off for my taste and I'm not a diva!"}
{"text":"Awesome!  I'd give it 6 stars if I could.  I had the brisket and ribs.  Brisket was very juicy and tender, ribs fell off the bone.  Smoke flavor was outstanding and nice crusty lack bits on both.

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Most disappointing lunch ever... atmosphere isnt horrible, and they have beer, thats a plus - might need to drink a couple to get through this meal.... placed our order then stood around like idiots because they dont tell you what to do. They will hollar out your name when it's ready which is annoying because its pretty loud in there. Bbq: tender and moist! Mac and cheese had NO flavor, spiral noodles with a creamy sauce and no seasoning or flavor. Fried okra, grainy corn meal coating with NO flavor. Meals do not come with hushpuppies or cornbread! Sauce bar was nice, but unkept and dirty with fruit flies flying around. My husband said the banana puddimg was great! DRIVE TO CONCORD FOR BBQ, WORTH THE DRIVE!"}
{"text":"Wondeful!   This is the kinda place where you walk in..... order at one end of the counter....and pick up your food at the end.   Its my favorite kinda place because you dont have to deal with servers or closing out tickets at the end of the meal.  You just claim your table...eat...and go.....

BBq was some of the best Ive had in Charlotte.  I likenit because it is pulled and not chopped.   The BBq is not fatty at all....and there are no \"questionable\" pieces on the plate.  Sometimes...when you eat BBq ...you might get that one sketchy piece that turns you off.  

I had Baked Beans, Corn Pudding, and Creamy slaw.  All in all they were pretty dang good....I felt like all 3 could have used a little more salt.   

If you are looking or a scrumptuos place to eat with no pain in the ass service....this is it.   I really really like it.

Prices are a bit high....but not over the top"}
{"text":"WOW. This was bad. Most of it ended up in the trash, except for the meat...which I've cleaned up for my Dobe and Doxie.

This was the first time I tried City BBQ in Ballantyne after it being highly recommended. Ordered a Family Pack - which includes 1 lb of the meat of your choice, 4 standard or lunch buns, 2 sides (pints), and cornbread. I chose pulled pork and standard buns.

Went to pick it up and everything was kept in an oven type thing next to the checkout. Thought that was pretty cool. However, when I drove 0.5 miles and got it into the house, it was lukewarm at best.

Service when picking up: the guy was extremely friendly and pulled my order together within a good amount of time. He did ask me...did I want sauce with my order. What? Why would I buy BBQ without sauce? This should be standard. It was not an additional charge, but I was kind of stunned by that question. 

The Pork: Their pulled pork is pretty tasty when you can get to it. My order is filled with fatty tissue and flabby skin. I'm not accustomed to that at all. I'd say 1/4 of the 1 lb (I guess) that was included was waste. I actually tried to make a sandwich from the pork and 'original sauce'. Just not good. I've cleaned the pork out for my dogs. 

Mac and Cheese: Pretty sure they are using Velveeta. Would never order this again.

Baked Beans with 'Brisket': I had high hopes for this. I found two pieces of brisket in my pint, the rest were skin and fat pieces. Why???

Buns - standard, and kind of dried out
Cornbread - standard

I don't get why people are giving this place the thumbs up. :("}
{"text":"Love the barbecue here! So juicy and fresh! I had a wonderful lunch and will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Love the ambience. So many different and great sauces. Fries with cheese and bacon were out of this world. Food was great. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We've been to a lot of bbq joints and this has got to be the worst! First, we were greeted by an employee with several hickeys all over her neck. There were three of us in our party and we each had to repeat our orders because she was unable to focus.
We got our food pretty quickly, but just as quickly we were all extremely disappointed. Everything from the appetizer to the meats and sides were very oily or greasy and  without much flavor.
We spent ~ $50 and threw out most (almost all) of our food. It was a huge waste of time and money.
Word of caution- if anyone has high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, etc.., steer clear of this place as there is a lack of healthy choices on the menu. 
As it was getting late, and we hadn't eaten our dinner, we headed over to Dean and Deluca to grab a quick and healthy salad and soup. They offered quick and friendly service, and quality ingredients, as usual!
If you're in the mood for bbq I would suggest trying Midwood Smokehouse as a much better alternative."}
{"text":"I admit I'm a barbecue junkie. I just flat love good barbecue. When City Barbecue opened I was excited to try it but it seemed to always be crowded so it took until now for us to get around to it. Boy was I disappointed. First, I should have realized why the crowds are getting smaller. Second, I should have realized a problem when I got out of the car. You know that wonderful aroma you smell at great barbecue places. The sweet smoke smell of hickory, cherry or apple or the savory smell of mesquite. Well it's not here. I'm not sure what they smoke with but it has more of a smell than an aroma.
The restaurant is laid out to efficiently move traffic through and seems clean and relatively attractive (are old license plates really necessary in all restaurants). The staff seems pleasant and only tried to hustle us through the ordering process a bit. Hint, If folks are holding back and looking up at the menu they are still trying to figure out what they want. Give them a minute. 
I had been thinking about barbecue ribs all day so that's what I ordered. How disappointing. They were somehow both dry and greasy at the same time. I'm not sure how you do that but chefs tell me that comes form cooking the meat too fast at too high a temperature. I mentioned that to a manager and he told me to try one of the sauces so I did. Their sweet barbecue sauce is the consistency of peanut butter. It doesn't work with the meat in any way. It just sort of glops on top and sits there. It did nothing to add to the flavor or the texture of the meat. I think the most disappointing thing was the \"bark\". You know that wonderful caramelized layer of flavor all great barbecue has. Well this was like biting into an ash tray. The only taste was of soot.
My wife loves pork barbecue.  Again it was greasy and dry. The texture was very stringy and you really had to work to chew it. The taste was not that nice hickory flavor that good pork barbecue has.  I don't know but I'm guessing oak?
Our sides were very forgettable. The beans were undercooked and sort of crunchy. Instead of flavoring them with pork they used brisket? It just didn't work. The fries seemed like a bargain brand straight out of the freezer.
When I talk about barbecue, I used to tell folks that the worst I ever had was wonderful. Now I can honestly say that I met a barbecue that I just didn't like."}
{"text":"Way too expensive for what you get. Sides taste like they were bought at the Food Lion down the street. Meat is extremely dry. Not going back. Better Barbecue within 5 miles."}
{"text":"BBQ had zero flavor. Had to drench it in sauce to get a decent flavor. The corn casserole was awesome though. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"You can smell hickory in the parking lot, and the aroma is heavenly. Found it to be the most overpriced pulled pork sandwich I've ever ordered. It was my first visit so they included samples of the sides--(which are all an extra $2.39) A plain sandwich is $7.32 with tax. None of the sides were stellar and the pork was in large chunks, making it difficult to eat without a fork. It was good, but definitely not worth the price. One visit was enough for me."}
{"text":"You know BBQ is done right, when you don't need sauce! This place never disappoints! Food is awesome and the Staff is exceptional!"}
{"text":"Been waiting for this to open and it did not disappoint! So gooood! My husband and I split the city sampler, we ordered the green beans and potato salad as sides it comes with your choice of Texas toast or corn bread we chose corn bread and it was so delicious along with the delicious brisket, sausage, turkey and pulled pork. The green beans had that nice smoke taste and the potato salad was best I've ever had! We're already talking about coming back this week, excellent service too.
 Great job City BBQ!"}
{"text":"Solid barbaque, good service, enough said."}
{"text":"A fun bbq place for a quick bite. I chose a pulled pork sandwich with two sides - french fries and corn pudding. The corn pudding was delicious and the fries were fresh and tasty. The sandwich was good. I love the multiple choices of sauces.

Next time i will try the peach cobbler but i was so full with my meal i didn't sare order this time. The staff was friendly and the tables were moderately clean to clean.

The prices were low with only $6.95 a sandwich. A great fast casual place that beats any McDonalds."}
{"text":"Cold Beer - Check, Great Q - Check.... Best baked beans and fried okra in town - check....  I have heard about City BBQ but tried it for the first time yesterday - came back again today... I am in love...."}
{"text":"Best brisket I've had in a long time, plus their collards are on point. 
Great service and clean restaurant."}
{"text":"First visit to this restaurant. Looked over past reviews and food sounded delicious. Just craved having ribs.  Ordered pork plate for my wife and slab of ribs with multiple sides as well as dessert. When I was called to the pick up area the girl was packing up the order. No ribs. She questioned the people cooking and they had to go back and look over the order. They went to their storage areas. No ribs. Went to other storage area. No ribs. Went into back. No ribs. Hey...we're sorry. Ran out of ribs. Choose something else I'm told. Looking over I see orders coming out for people coming in AFTER me. Couple of racks of ribs going out on their trays. 

I looked back over the other reviews. Looks more like the rule rather than the exception running out of ribs. It was explained to me as well as in the other review they don't want to have left over food. Then again at 6:00 PM and the dinner crowd is coming in you want to have a substantial amount of food ready to serve. I can understand if it's close to closing time running out or supplier runs out. Not having it ready and serving later arriving customers very poor form and customer service.   

Was so angry by the service I took the food for my wife but lost my appetite for dinner. Told I needed to come back sometime and try the ribs. Lol...are you going to have any to serve?  Other review even called in and told come and get them only to find out there were none. Very disappointing all around. 

To all I would be careful going in with a desire for any particular food. You may be surprised that it won't be available when you get there."}
{"text":"City BBQ appears to be a popular spot so I decided to order online with curbside to go pickup . 

The mobile app was easy to maneuver ended up indulging on 2 combo meals with one side each and one pulled pork sandwich with fries .

Arrived at City BBQ Matthews at 8:25 , waited outside at one of the curb side pickup spots until about 8:35 . No one came out , they appeared busy so I called and stated no one has come out to bring us our order yet . The young lady that came out to greet us told us they didn't have receipt of our order . 3-2-1 , 1-2-3 ... this is my on the go method of calming down before I spit out Hangry remarks . I showed the employee our email receipt .  After waiting 10 more minutes she comes back out with a large bag , apologizing and offering a few extra treats for the inconvenience.  (unfortunately I can't comment on them bc I'm not eating yummy chocolate cake or banana pudding right now) 

Now, the food ... the reason behind my 3star rating 
BRISKET : plenty in our servings but a lil too dry for my liking .  I don't want to have to slather it with bbq sauce 
SAUSAGE: it was good , I actually ate this more than the brisket , but nothing I'm salivating to come back for 
PULLED CHICKEN : Dry ... that's all 
PULLED PORK : Dry... I'm sure paired with the coleslaw it would be a little better but I'm more of a Carolina bbq kinda gal with mayo inspired slaw and a vinegar base bbq pork... sooooo you get my drift . 
COLLARDS: The winner of this entire dinner.  Yummy to my southern girl tummy . 

Overall, I'm sure City BBQ will continue to receive lots of traffic , the food isn't bad , the service was really nice, but it's just not my cup of tea for bbq."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to visit City Barbeque during a Yelp event the day before their grand opening, and I was able to try most items on their menu.  Their food is absolutely delicious, and I expect they will do very well in this location (their 4th in the Charlotte area).

The folks at City Barbeque have a passion for delivering both great food and service.  They offer smoked brisket, pork, turkey, chicken, sausage, and ribs, and if you can't decide, you can pick two or even get a sampler.  

They make everything fresh daily, including their chicken broth, collards, peach cobbler, corn pudding, etc.  They only have a freezer to store peaches for their cobbler, since frozen peaches are better.  (I keep frozen peaches myself for smoothies and baking!)  But everything else is fresh.  If anything is left after the end of the day, they donate the leftovers to a local agency to distribute to the needy.  

Here's what I loved the most - 
- Pork - I'm a sucker for pulled pork, and theirs is absolutely melt-in-your-mouth.  They even offer a \"Lo Lo\" style, which is chopped, Eastern NC-style, and served with vinegar sauce (\"Swine Wine,\" aka, delicious).
- Brisket - I usually don't eat brisket because it tends to be dry.  Such is not the case with City Barbeque's version.  It was succulent and tender.
- Turkey - Here's another meat that really surprised me, since turkey isn't my favorite thing.  But their smoked turkey is so juicy, you don't need to add a thing to it.  Hint: You can order a whole turkey for Thanksgiving, too!
- Ribs - I dare you to try to finish their full rack in one sitting.  Theirs are meaty and tender.  
- Hush puppies - These are oh, so delightfully crispy, and served with yummy honey!  
- Corn pudding - I'm salivating just thinking of their corn pudding.  It's one of the best I've ever had.
- Collards - Always a favorite with my husband, theirs is chopped and made fresh daily.  They also don't overcook theirs, so it has a nice bit of crunch.
- Vinegar slaw - They have two versions of their slaw (with vinegar and without), and their vinegar version is tangy and delicious.
- Potato salad - This one has both mayo and mustard, with just the right mix of chunky potatoes and yummy dressing.
- Banana pudding - You must leave room for this dessert, folks.  City's is different from the usual, with caramel, cinnamon, and homemade whipped cream.  It's simply outstanding.

Honestly, though, there wasn't a thing I didn't like.  Their half chicken, for example, is huge.  It's also pastured raised, and free of antibiotics and hormones.  Their sausage is made in the house--with a combo of beef and pork--and has a nice kick to it.  Their baked beans are tangy and slightly sweet.  Their green beans are cooked with bacon, providing great flavor.  

City Barbeque offers catering, and they showed us how they served at events.  They provide a fully staffed meal, and it's a great option for any sized event.  Surprisingly, much of their catered business is for weddings!

While it's a \"chain\" in that they have 30+ locations, City Barbeque offers a hometown restaurant feel.  With their great food and service, I expect they'll be a huge success in Huntersville.  I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"This was our first time eating at any City Barbeque location and it will not be the last!

It is very kid friendly and the portions are HUGE!  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich naked with vinegar coleslaw and it was terrific! The pork was juicy and tender and too much for me to eat. I got the corn bread (soooo yummy) and fries. We also sampled the corn pudding - so tasty!!

My husband had the two meat entree (ribs and pork) and he said they were so juicy and tender as well.

The kids had chicken tenders and Mac & Cheese both with fries and loved them!

I can see us ordering take out in the future to share with family and friends at home. Go, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The peach cobbler is exceptional here. I enjoy the wide array of sauces to choose from and the fixing bar. Any place with unlimited pickles has to get at least 1 star in my book. I appreciate the expanded selection of sides which include chili and stews plus they have seasonal sides. I enjoy variety. 
The bbq is disappointing. I have tried the bbq on multiple occasions since they opened because I have wanted the food to be great but it is not. The bbq is OK and expensive for what they offer. They have huge smokers but the meats lack smoked flavor. Originally I thought well wait a few months until the new smokers are well seasoned and broken in BUT no it has not changed. 
Don't get me wrong the meats are tender and juicy but they lack the slow smoked flavor they claim to have."}
{"text":"Was here opening weekend. Very surprised at the flavor and flair of this place. I loved the huge portions and various sauces. The potato salad and beans are awesome. Very worth your time."}
{"text":"It was very good and the Manager AJ was very much in his element. He checked on us through out our meal.... it is more \"self\" service then we like but the food was really good. You stand in line to order and they call your name when its ready.... so no real wait staff. The Manager took really good care of us and we are \"Stealz\" members so Nancy had a complimentary Banana Pudding AJ even fresh made Nancy's Pudding as they had run out of it -- which she said she would go there just for that. She had the smoked Chicken and said it was better then Midwoods -- I had a Pulled Pork sandwich which the sauce was good but it lacked the \"Smoked\" flavor. -- over all we had a very good experience and would go again. Service wise they had it all over Midwoods and was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service! Definitely will come again!! Happy Birthday Guys! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Wow! We were pleasantly surprised with how great this was, and how many choices were on the menu.  I got a pulled chicken  sandwich, he got the pulled pork.  Both were moist, flavorful, and tender.  They have a great fixins bar with onions, fresh dill pickles, and tons of sauces to try! (Try Low Co. If you like a more traditional vinegar sauce).
Sides:  The fries are amazing and you MUST top them with the cheese and bacon, the hush puppies are ok, the baked beans were sweet and savory (I'm guessing molasses), and the okra were crisp and seasoned perfectly. 
They have yummy lemonade, and my fiancee was excited that they had 3 diet sodas (unheard of) to choose from -- pepsi, mountain dew, and Dr pepper. 
The cashier was sweet enough to give us free chocolate cake to go.  We were so stuffed from huge portions, that we had room for dessert. 
We will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"First time at this location or any other.  Food was really good although for the price I thought the meat portion should be a bit larger.  I had the pulled pork and tried all their sauces. The \"Brush Fire\" sauce was really good!   Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Super Good!! I really loved how they make the pulled pork sandwiches in front of you, pulling the pork out right in front of you! Really good stuff, honestly the best BBQ joint in Charlotte NC. Management really makes a mark here, they really do take care of their customers. Don't over order, one serving is huge!!!"}
{"text":"Not exactly the experience I was hoping for.  It was later in the evening on a Sunday.  The staff seemed a little busy or overwhelmed for some reason, although it wasn't really that busy.  I waited for awhile to get my order in.  I sampled the mac & cheese before deciding what sides to order and it is very creamy, not baked.  I decided against it and got the pulled pork sandwich, baked beans, gumbo, and corn pudding.  Now mind you, I have been to a YELP event at their first location & was pretty satisfied with most of the stuff.  They were out of collards, sad.  So let's give the run down: baked beans were not good.  It seemed like they sat in a thick, sweet paste all day and we got bottom of the barrel? I don't know, but not what I remember.  Gumbo: horrible...the rice was hard & sticky, there was no sausage in mine, and the flavor was disappointing.  Corn pudding: good, exactly how I remember it.  I tried my friend's okra: horrible!!!!! What the heck??? I don't understand what went wrong tonight. I enjoyed my corn pudding and my pulled pork sandwich with the sweeter sauce and an orange sauce (forget the name).

A few managers came out and took away our gumbo. They checked back on us and even brought us dessert to make up for some things.  They were both really nice and I was thankful they helped us out.  I just don't get what happened with the food, because I remember loving a lot of it at the Ballantyne location on YELP event night. The staff was unorganized and not paying attention or busy with something..I'm just not sure what. 

Underwhelming experience and a little depressing.  Maybe an off night?!  Thank you to the managers for caring and being very courteous.  Good customer care."}
{"text":"Hands down this was best BBQ we ever had. We chose the Judges Sampler. Sides we chose were corn pudding and fried okra. It was more than enough food for the 2 of us. The meat was cooked perfectly. The bone fell out of the chicken practically. The ribs had a wonderful smoky flavor too. The brisket was my favorite. The corn pudding was the perfect texture. Not too sweet. The banana pudding is a must have! I wish I could have taken a gallon home. 

Service here was superb. The staff are friendly, attentive and they work their tails off. When we visit this area again we will for sure return."}
{"text":"We stopped on a whim to just try this out and we will be back. Everything from the atmosphere to the food is on point. Mah belly leaves happy today."}
{"text":"In town for visiting family, this was my first time visiting here. Friendly service and clean atmosphere, and meat was decent. Pickles and jalapenos would've been wonderful if they didn't taste so store-bought, though."}
{"text":"So full!

Pros:
Quick service
Great food
Extensive menu - get a sampler: the judges platter came with ribs, chicken, and pork. All 3 meats were great. We also got two small sides. The corn bread is very moist and delish!
Tons of choices for homemade BBQ sauce 
Great condiments bar!

Cons:
The mac and cheese left something to be desired

You can eat it there or take it to go. It's very casual and laid back, but really great and quick BBQ. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"I did it the right way this time. I ordered chicken and ribs. A much better experience. Both items were very tasty, and the meat on the ribs fell off the bone. Not a big fan of the Texas Toast or the sides, hence the 4 opposed to the 5. However, that's not the only factor.

While most people working here seem to be friendly, when I approached the counter to order, I said, \"Hey. How's it going?\" to the guy behind the counter. He just stared back at me, and I could tell he was thinking: Just place your order, man. He was friendly after that, but still not a good first impression. 

In my opinion, this place is the epitome of a 4. No better, no worse."}
{"text":"We came here pretty late today (Father's Day) and they were out of pulled pork and ribs, but that didn't really affect us as we generally try other things at BBQ places.

I purchased the half chicken since I couldn't decide what I wanted. Chicken had pretty good flavoring for $9.99. The Mac n cheese was amazing! I also got fried pickles, which were nice and thick, and the sauce was good.

My daughter got the kids Mac n cheese, cornbread and ate part of my chicken :-)

My husband got brisket (he said it was a bit fatty, but generally good). He also got baked beans, Mac n cheese, and potato salad. Love the potato salad!!

My brother-in-law got the turkey on the bun. He said the turkey was super tender and delicious. He also got green beans, and Mac n cheese. Said both were good!

My daughter and I got lemonade to drink, it was very good! My husband and brother-in-law both got beer, and said that they liked the choices available.

The only thing we didn't like was the sauce caddy. Although they are esthetically pleasing-- it seems like you can't disinfect them. Though, I could just be a weird person and maybe they throw them away and change them regularly ?

Other than that-- I will say, we will likely be back as the food was good for the price and the staff was incredibly friendly :-)"}
{"text":"Wow is all i can say... Well not really but this was AMAZING! I attended a Yelp event held at City Barbeque today so I was able to sample some of their vittles. 

 We started with smoked turkey and sausage. The turkey was smoked to perfection and super tender. It was definitely not that dry thanksgiving variety. The sausage was delicious, as well. It had a bit of a kick to it. 

The next course was the  smoked half chicken. Out of all the barbecue joints I've been to City Barbeque really nails it. Not dry, ultra flavorful. You couldn't ask for a better bird. 

Next we had the pulled pork and brisket. The pork was flavorful and juicy, while the brisket was so tender you could easily cut it with a spoon. They had several sauces but none were required. 

Just when we thought we were done, they brought out the St Louis ribs. They pride themselves on not being the fall off the bone variety. It was said that this meant they were cooked too long.  It must be something to that because their ribs tasted as if they were from the heavens!

How could I forget the sides?! We tried the corn pudding, potato salad, green beans, and baked beans. The corn pudding almost tasted like a desert. My table loved it. I couldn't decide. I liked all of the sides. The potato salad tasted like what grandma used to make. The baked beans were some of the best I've ever had and the green beans were very flavorful. You'll love them, i guarantee. 

The service was top notch. The staff was amazing. The tea was equally amazing. I will definitely be back. Great job!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and everything is always great.  I read some reviews about prices being high but for what you get it's well worth the extra buck!  We have always brought food home because the portions are so generous.  Seems it's a happy place to work.... everyone is always very courteous and willing to help!  We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat. I love the food and the friendly staff!! 
The banana pudding is Amazing."}
{"text":"I went to the Yelp event at the City Barbecue in Matthews and had a great time (I'd go out on a limb and say it was the best Yelp Elite event I've been to) so when this location opened closer to home, my fiancé and I had to go support them. 

Let's start with the employees - they were all super nice. You know how in commercials, restaurant employees smile genuinely at the customer and laugh jovially? It was like that minus the commercial. Everyone was friendly and welcoming. I noticed that they brought the food out to a couple near us who was dining with a cranky infant, rather than calling their name to come to the counter and pick it up. I appreciate little things like that - kindness. 

The food was amazing! I ordered the brisket sandwich combo with corn pudding and fries. It was so much food that I barely ate any of the fries. My fiancé had the brisket, sausage, mac and cheese, and baked beans - he loved it all. 
*If I had one area for improvement, it would be for there to be some fish/shrimp options. As a person who doesn't eat a lot of meat, I won't be able to come here as often as I want because of the limited options without meat. That being said - when I do come, I know it will be wonderful.

Great food! Great experience! We will be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying City BBQ and was not happy. The young lady at the front was nice, but the guy in the back fixing my plate was just slapping food down and had no sense of urgency.  I ordered the 2 meat meal with pulled pork and Turkey, green beans and corn pudding. Well, the bread was cold, corn pudding was not sweet and had no taste. The pulled pork was very bland. I don't think I'll be back, I get a better meal with flavor at Shane\"s.."}
{"text":"We had them cater our company function and we were very pleased with everything they served.  The pulled pork was amazing and all the sauces were delicious!  The team that came out were all very nice and energetic. City Barbeque catering for the WIN!!  Thanks for being awesome!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to have a go to bbq place.  However, this place is not it.  The bbq is good, i just wasnt a fan of their sides.  The mac and cheese is mediocre. Their collard greens and baked beans has meat in it, which i dont like.  I am all for flavor, but I dont actually need brisket in my sides. 
There is one item that I consistently pick up on my car ride home.... its their peach cobbler.  Talk about heavenly.  This dessert is life changing.  If you havent tried it, please do.  You will thank me later."}
{"text":"It was yummy! But quite honestly, if I'm ever back in Charlotte, it'd be my last choice. I like BBQ but I'm just not a fan of theirs. But it was good!"}
{"text":"One of the most professional attentive and best barbecue places I've been to. The food is fast, fresh, delicious and plentiful. Be sure to download the city barbecue app and like them on Facebook and they give you a free dessert. You can also accumulate points with their rewards program which is a wonderful addition. At the self-service counter where you get your sodas and beverages there also homemade pickles which are made fresh every day by one of the cooks. There's a plethora of barbecue sauces ranging from hot spicy tangy and sweet. The staff are extremely happy helpful and they seem to love their jobs which makes the experience of coming here pleasant. It is one of The few places in Charlotte I have frequented more than five times."}
{"text":"Family took me here on 6/25/18 for a belated Fathers Day Meal.
Tried the new brisket tacos and they were off the hook! Smoky, shredded beef brisket on soft flour tacos served with a corn, onion and tomato salsa along with a lime wedge, pickled red onions, half of a roasted jalapeno and a creamy smoky sauce.
Topped 'em with swine wine (The eastern Carolina style vinegar dip) to start and then built some of the best tacos I think I have ever had! Washed them down with an Arnold Palmer which made for one good meal. Will definitely be back for more of those brisket tacos!
Daughter enjoyed here pulled pork sandwich with peach habanero sauce.
I tried the sauce and you got about 2 seconds of sweet peach before the heat really kicked in! Wife enjoyed her all sides plate as well.
The only place City Barbeque failed us that night and this kept me from giving them five stars was my granddaughters child's plate.
She received the tiniest and I do mean tiniest chicken leg any one of us have ever seen! Two bites and it was gone. She said \"It was nothing but a bone!\" That along with the micro cup of mac and cheese (which was not that good) was no where enough food for a 7 year old. Because of that we had to let her eat off our plates because she was still hungry.
If that is the child's plate portion and an adult plate is too big maybe you need to come up with an \"young adult plate\" with more appropriate size portions. Next time we will just make her a plate from our plates as the child's plate with the very skimpy portions is not worth the price.
Other than that, I had a great time with the family and we all left stuffed and happy."}
{"text":"Great BBQ. I got the pulled chicken sandwich(I would suggest getting it on the Texas toast because it can get a little messy) fresh cut fries(amazing) and Mac n cheese(just okay) the chicken was moist, tender, and flavorful! Would definitely recommend and return with my family!"}
{"text":"More like 3.8 stars, but not 4 yet, and definitely will dine again. 

Great selection of sauces - a must. 

Ribs = really good flavor, texture, and rub, maybe a little less fat would be good. 
Pulled Pork = could use more smoke as a standalone but good. 
Smoked Sausage = good. 
Chicken = did not try, assume good. 

My opinion.  The best BBQ besides 521 BBQ.   

Q Shack, Queen City BBQ, are ok.  Harper's has a good pulled pork sandwich."}
{"text":"Great BBQ and great price.  The meat is cooked well and great choices for side dishes.  Employees are friendly and will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Much improved!!  When this place opened, we had very bad experiences. Bad food (cold), being of food choices, etc.  The company was very interested in feedback and wanting to make things better.  We decided to take a break as we simply didn't have any luck.  Well, that changed this weekend - and for the good!  

After nearly a year, we decided to go back and try it again. We got the turkey and the sausages. Wow, this place has gotten good. Took the food home and it was hot - major issue the first couple of times.  The turkey was juicy and tender. So good!  But the sausages - oh man, the sausages, were money!! So much so, we've talked about it all day the following day about how we can't wait to get them again. Service seemed much better and more polite. The kinks seemed to have been worked out and we are excited to go back!"}
{"text":"I've tried to get ribs twice in six months. Each time they are out of ribs. A rib place, no ribs. City Barbeque in Ohio, never a problem."}
{"text":"Really delicious flavorful BBQ! The sides were incredible. The corn pudding is amazing. They have creamy cole slaw! The hush puppies are so good I saved them and reheated in toaster oven. It's a great place with indoor and outdoor seating. There's a lot of sauces to try that are great. This place seems to go the extra mile that other bbq places don't. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Love love this place and location.. food is always on point .. I just wish they had a couple of spicy sauces at the sauce station. Love the brisket and pulled pork sandwich and ribs and basket cheesy fries .. staff have always been friendly."}
{"text":"Visited this location on way home from ikea .. it's a typical city location, as always very delicious and staff are super friendly.. got our lolos sandwiches and they ran out of buns and they gave us Texas toast instead and of course the servings were generous. Have been to 3 city locations in Charlotte and I must say I love it more and more .. kudos to the awesome and friendly staff in the kitchen .."}
{"text":"Having lived in the Carolinas all my life and going to college in Alabama as well as working in barbecue restaurants, I consider myself a barbecue snob. I was skeptical about barbecue from Ohio since I've been spoiled when it comes to smoked swine.
My husband and I ordered the judge's sampler which is enough to feed two people. There was plenty of meat, but two  5oz sides is definitely a sample and not a side at all when sharing. My husband ate the brisket since I'm not a fan of it and he said that it was just okay- a bit dry and bland, and he ordered the fatty brisket. The ribs were good and came clean off of the bone. I loved their smoked chicken as it had a rich smoky flavor and was mopped in sauce. Then there's the pork. Well, the pork isn't exciting at all to our dismay. It had no flavor and was dry. Disappointing. The corn soufflé was good as were the baked beans, but they were really too sweet. 
So, we tried, we ate, and it was lackluster. I don't see any visits back in our future."}
{"text":"First time at City BBQ, and it was very good!  I had the pulled pork lunch meal with two small sides.  I chose the Mac and cheese as well as the baked beans.
The pulled pork was VERY flavorful, and not dry!!  It's nice to have juicy pulled pork.  I added a touch of their sauces, and it made one tasty sandwich.
My sister had a side of corn pudding, which I thought was bland for my taste.  I tried the baked beans, which were pretty thick and heavy.  Very good, but a touch too sweet (again, for my taste).
The Mac and cheese was pretty good as well.  I would have liked a little more taste to the cheese sauce, but I can't say that I did not enjoy it.
We brought my mom a side of the potato salad with her meal, and this was by far my favorite side dish.  It was nice and creamy, and you can taste the variety of ingredients.
Overall, a pleasant first experience that I would enjoy to do again!  It's a nice addition to the area."}
{"text":"We both got the pick two meat. My boyfriend and I could have split one of them. I wish it was less in cost and portion, because it was like four days of leftovers. That's great, but I'm good with just a day. The chicken was our favorite of any BBQ restaurant. The pork was delicious and not too fatty. The brisket didn't need a knife, it just crumbled apart. It did have a lot of fat if that bothers you, but it came off easily. The baked beans were way too thick for us. They were in like a thick BBQ sauce and had chunks of brisket in it. Flavor was good. Mac and cheese was cold, but good. It wasn't anything special though. They are super quick. They have about ten different sauces, I liked the mustard and vinegar one. There is also one that is kinda thick like a duck sauce from an Asian place, it's great w the chicken. Def going back!! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Some of the better BBQ in the area. Service was great. Chicken was super moist which is really rare. I didn't care for the ribs but my kids killed a full slab so I think it was just me. Brisket and Pork was really good. Sauces were very good. Watch out for the Piedmont sauce! It will light you up! Overall really good."}
{"text":"Great service with even better food! The fresh cut fries are some of the best I've had in Charlotte so far! I had the turkey breast sandwich and I took meat off the sandwich and was full! Great place to eat!!"}
{"text":"The best collard greens in town! 

City barbecue is definitely the place to go if you are in need of barbecue in the ever growing University area. In theme with the changing times, this restaurant is low-key causal dining. Once they ring you up, grab a seat and they will call out your name. 

The food is great for BBQ. Everything is made fresh the day of and you can tell. Me and the boo both got the brisket meal. I got mine with two sides: macaroni and cheese and collard greens. The collard greens are half a step below my mama's Thanksgiving collard greens. I am a collard green snob and haven't had some this good. It was the perfect amount of slight bitterness and seasoning. The macaroni and cheese was good for a restaurant but didn't knock my socks off. The brisket was so damn tender! Some of the best I've had in Charlotte. The only downside was that it was a little cold for my taste... but I guess I'm glad they didn't warm it up and cause it to dry out. 

The food is delicious, the service is great, the bathrooms are clean, and their prices are on point. Definitely a great addition to the community."}
{"text":"We wanted to try one of the feasts, but were told by the cashier that they were out of ribs at 6 pm on a Saturday. Later we learned from another patron that they were making more ribs, but it would be a 10 min wait. We would've waited 10 mins for ribs so we could've gotten the meal we actually wanted. Communication seems to be an issue here. 

I tried the brisket tacos. The brisket was ok, but chewy. The tacos were also tiny for $9.  They needed a side to be included for that price. 

My dining companions were happy with the cornbread and pulled pork. The mac & cheese was ok, but nothing special. It tasted like noodles with cheese sauce poured over it. It didn't taste special or made-from-scratch. 

We'll probably give this place another chance as overall the food was decent and the atmosphere was fun."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my fav Barbeque's in all of Charlotte. Their sides are soooo good and I love their lunch deals. You can get a meat with two sides for around $9-10 depending if you get a drink or not. 

The pulled pork is definitely made just right and you can get as much barbecue sauce as you want if you eat in. They have a plentiful amount of sauces you can try until you figure out which one is your favorite. 

Personally, I like the original the most if I'm eating the pulled pork sandwich! 

I think this is a good joint near the university area and is often under-looked because it is a chain restaurant. However, it's an awesome Barbeque place for a reasonable price with some banging potato salad, collard greens, and baked beans.. and corn bread... and green beans... and what the heck! All their sides are good!!!"}
{"text":"You pay for your sides separately. Pricey. 
Baked beans had 3 huge chunks of fat back in my bowl. Not good. 
Creamy coleslaw was not good. 
Fries were Great! 
Barbq pork was ok. Sauces great. 
Servers just yell out your name when it's ready. You go get it."}
{"text":"Very very very good. I worked at Jim N Nicks for a year (also a BBQ restaurant) and this place is almost/just as good. I love the toast they give with the meals. The turkey and pork are really good.

Update: I went a few months after opening on a slow weekday and the food was just as good. The sides were fresh and hot and the food was very fresh. The staff was very nice, they brought my dogs water which is always very considerate and appreciated. I believe you also get a $5 coupon if you download their app, so check that out!"}
{"text":"Just not that good. Jim and Nix is better quality and comparable in price. Nothing was terrible, but nothing was all that good."}
{"text":"So I moved down from Ohio to Charlotte 5 years ago. Granted, Ohio is not a mecca for Barbeque, but North Carolina was, supposedly. I was sooooo looking forward to all the good barbecue I could find. Problem was, I couldn't find any. All the \"Legendary\" spots in Lexington and Durham and Eastern NC just didn't cut it. In fact, I would venture to say, that many of them were getting by on a name from 50 years ago. I went and bought a Big Green Egg and started making much better barbecue than I could find in a restaurant. Problem is, I couldn't get my brisket right. Then, I heard that City Barbeque, a chain yes, but also my favorite spot from when I lived in Ohio was coming 10 mins away from where I lived. Perfect! What, they have 2 in Raleigh also!!! Bonus!

I have been 3-4 times since they opened. They never disappoint. Although I have been getting the same thing here since I was visiting the ones in Ohio. Brisket, potato salad and baked beans. Typically use the Sweet City sauce, but am really digging the Piedmont Pride as well. They didn't have that one in Ohio. At least 5 years ago. Occasionally would treat myself to a banana pudding. You absolutely cannot go wrong with this meal! Thank you for coming to NC. You have now effectively upped NC's BBQ game!!!"}
{"text":"We ate there three weeks after they opened on a Sunday around 11:20am. They were training a cashier and she was nice but struggling, the line grew behind us.

They have the brisket on the table behind the cashier line and it sat there while we waited. My brisket was warm at best. My fries were cold. I took them back up and the replaced them.

Flavor of brisket was good, but couldn't get beyond temperature of food and service."}
{"text":"I'm not a big bbq fan since most of the food is too heavy, but I really liked the pork better here than any other bbq places I've had.  I don't like the cornbread.  It's too plain & dry.  They need some real corn pieces in it."}
{"text":"We placed a carry out order with CBBQ, and the food is wonderful. With plenty of sauce options, we ordered the \"motherload\" which is a sampler of all the meats they have, accompanied by several side dishes, and feeds 6 people. 

We can vouch for the motherload's capability of feeding six people, and for the deliciousness of the food. The only improvement possible here would be that the side dishes could be larger. For example, if all six of you want Mac and cheese, you'll need to order three Mac and cheese sides. 

Our order was ready within 25 minutes of us ordering it on a Saturday night, so the timelines of the food wasn't an issue at all. I definitely recommend this restaurant, and the spicy BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"I have eaten at a lot of BBQ places and smoke my own ribs and roast in the summer.  City Barbeque knows how it's done and how to treat their customers. We were greeted by a friendly and cheerful hostess who asked if we were new customers and explained the selections and deals. I ordered 1/2 rack of ribs, corn bread and mac n cheese. Before I paid I was given a new customer gift bag with literature, menu, magnet and a jar of their own BBQ rub!  She also encouraged me to sign up for an app that would earn free drinks, perks and progressive discounts!

The ribs were perfect, tender juicy and the right amount of smoke served with a nice size piece of toast. I used City BBQs top 3 recommended sauces ranging from sweet to spicy. All were perfect in their own way. My favorite was the spicy. 

The corn bread was a good size loaf. Corn bread is simply not prepared right at most places, City Makes it absolutely perfect. I could easily survive on City Ken bread and butter. 

The macaroni and cheese was spiraling creamy goodness. In another life I would just eat this and be perfectly happy. 

It's not every day that you can break down the individual elements of a meal and be content with any one element. It's a testament to City Barbeque owners and staff taking care of each step. 

Great job, I will be back."}
{"text":"My new favorite bbq spot! stopped by after seeing the smokers going, but found out there was a private soft opening that evening and they didn't actually open until the following week...but the staff didn't let me leave hungry! I was invited in, taken care of quickly, and the food and service did not disappoint. The Lolo's sandwich was delicious, but my favorite are the collard greens!! I may be ordering a party size just for me. They also have an assortment of sauces sweet, spicy, vinegar and the list goes on. we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time here, took the food out, didn't get to enjoy the environment, maybe next time ill sit inside and order the peach cobbler. Food was delicious though, I ordered pulled chic, brisket, baked beans and mac&cheese,  $$, delicious. Why not 5 stars, it was my first time.  Will be going back for second servings 




Thanks, 

C."}
{"text":"Adding the 5th star as the parking is on the shopping center, not this establishment.  What were they thinking?"}
{"text":"City Barbeque continues to be a great place to eat.  The smoked pork and turkey are my favorites, along with the baked beans and banana pudding with hints of caramel.  I also had the chocolate cake a couple days later and man oh man, it is quite delightful!  The serving size is big so plan to eat only half and save the rest for later.  I am giving the restaurant 4 stars because the cleanup area was overflowing with trash and the filling station was out of forks and boxes.  However, once I mentioned it, it was immediately handled."}
{"text":"This location is down the street from my job and my coworkers & I might come here way too often as some know us by name. I've tried almost everything on the menu so far and not much has disappointed expect the pulled chicken because it's in some sauce. My go to choices are the beef brisket with collard greens and the smokehouse turkey salad. The banana pudding is so delicious and I usually get that as my second side. They also have fries that you can add bacon & cheese too, it could have been a meal itself but they were good. 
I've only had a few issues but each one was handle great. They have an app that is easy to use and allows you to earn rewards, Ive earned quite a few myself. The staff is friendly and I always have great customer service when I came here whether I order online or inside the store."}
{"text":"I ordered the brisket with cole slaw & Mac & cheese as my sides plus the shredded chicken on a roll which was all delicious. I want to try other menu items in time."}
{"text":"We went in expecting a not good experience. After telling the cashier it was our first time there, he explained the menu amd gave his recommended choices. We picked 2 meats and 2 sides one drink. Our total came to just over $20. So far love it. The real test came when our order came up.  The portions were huge. Hubby amd I shared and there was still left overs. We got the pulled Chipotle rib meat and a very tender full flavor cut of brisket. Yum yum. I am not big on barbecue but this is my favorite place for it so far in Charlotte. The price is great and the food delish. Plus the service is superb. We were checked on a few times and even offered dessert. It was my birthday dinner and I did get the chocolate cake. Must say its very close to my own recipe. I don't know that I could tell them apart if side by side. 10 stars for service and 8 for food(hubby wanted wings). Keep up the friendly service and laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great BBQ.  I think it's my new favorite in town and that's saying a lot with all the good BBQ around Charlotte.  We tried the sampler since it was our first time and we loved it but especially loved the Brisket and the pulled pork.  Good service and quick.  Sauces are great.  Highly recommend this place for any BBQ fan!"}
{"text":"Four stars because the brisket was decent. I will come back but beware this is not North Carolina style barbecue... pork is pulled not chopped.  At least everything is smoked which is a cut above most charlotte BBQ fare.  Banana pudding is definitely substandard by Carolina standards.   Collard greens and baked beans were great on the side."}
{"text":"City Barbeque has consistently, excellent beef brisket.  It is always moist, which is hard to find. Their service is excellent and they treat their customers like family.  I have made them a regular destination for brisket. Their banana pudding is the best I have had from any restaurant.  I highly recommend City Barbeque."}
{"text":"We went on Saturday after we had three different friend groups tell us that their BBQ was pretty darn good. It was excellent!
They also were doing a Vet's Day promo that judging from the dining room was very well received.
I got pork on Texas Toast (recommended by the super friendly cashier) with mac and cheese and sweet potato casserole. My hubby went for the two meat sampler with brisket and ribs with collard greens and their bbq gumbo. Incredible! The Mac was not the most mind blowing side (it is noodles and cheese...) but the sweet potatoes made up for it! Grannie needs their recipe.
We will be back sooner than we know. Super cute inside, great BBQ, and nice people. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"I got the Brisket with St Louis Ribs, Collard greens with pork and corn bread.  It also came with Texas toast.  They had 13 sauces to choose from.   I liked the Piedmont pride sauce (it had vinegar) .


The brisket was  delicious and had a good smoke ring. The ribs were equally as good, along with the corn bread. The star of the meal was the collard greens.

I got the plastic utensils due to the fact the real ones did not look that clean.  That's why it did not get 5 stars."}
{"text":"The food was really really good but the staff just couldn't get it together! Had to return to the counter 3 or 4 times. The child portion of Mac n cheese was smaller than my side order of slaw!!!"}
{"text":"We got the Judge Sampler to-go. Our first time ever trying this restaurant. Very good food! The half slab of ribs was a lil crunchy on the end peices but the middle pieces were delish! Pulled pork, brisket and chicken were great! Being as we ordered a family sized combo meal, our only complaint is the side of mac n cheese was extremely small (you pick 2 sides with the Judge sampler) My 2-yr old, who barely eats as it is, ate have of the mac. The fries were really good, also a lil small of a portion but not as bad as the mac. I'd say 4.5 with the portion of mac n cheese and we havent dined in yet so i cant comment on that.."}
{"text":"We went right when they first opened and tried the chicken, brisket, pork, and ribs on a combo plate.  The Pork was the best, pulled chicken was next.  The ribs and brisket were ok. The best sides were the slaw and potato salad. Pass on the mac n cheese and fried okra. Nice atmosphere and outside seating. We will be back and update the review."}
{"text":"If I can give them more stars I would! The beef brisket was excellent, the cornbread delicious, their chicken was tender and juicy, and their coleslaw was amazing! Everything about City Barbeque is exactly what you would want when thinking about good quality barbecue. Aside from the food being stellar, their service was outstanding. You can definitely tell that the owner takes pride in their product because the moment you step in, you're treated like family. Their hospitality sets them apart from other restaurants- and it helps that their food is great too! Keep it up City Barbeque... we WILL be back again!!"}
{"text":"They have some of the best BBQ I have ever had.  Highly recommend this place if you're in the University area. Dare I say even better than Mac's Speed Shop?"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. The brisket is my favorite, pulled pork and ribs are not my favorite. The sides are pretty good, corn pudding is delicious and I would highly recommend trying it! Wish the Mac and cheese was better, considering how easy and cheap it is. Was told by staff it is made from a plastic bag of pre made sauce and none of the staff even like it! I will def be back but not for the Mac and cheese which is usually a go to for me at a bbq joint. Please home make the Mac sauce! Don't skip corners on little things like this"}
{"text":"this place has a reputation for great barbecue! Hannah Marie is a great hostess and if you're not sure what to get, I strongly recommend the Judge's Sampler!! it will cure your hunger and slide you into a warm food coma!!"}
{"text":"A really good place. the  brisket, pulled pork and sausage are excellent! The Mac and cheese was off the chain but the fried okra needs a little help. the breading wasn't consistent and at times, it overpowered the okra. I drank Arnold Palmers because their lemonade reminds you of grandma's,  ok!"}
{"text":"In town for a family gathering and Dora ordered ahead for a gathering of 20 for a Sunday lunch. They had everything ready on time when we arrived to pick up the food. They provided the plates, napkins and utensils as well as extra sauce.

It would have been better if they had some way to mark the bbq sauce containers so all the guest would know the type of sauces. There must have been six. There was a nice mix of sweet, mustard, vinegar based, sorta hot and extra hot.

Everyone really liked the que as well as the sides of mac n cheese and the collards. The collards were especially good as they included chips of beef brisket.

Overall it was good, even if it's a franchise joint."}
{"text":"\"Let's meet for meat\" would be a good tagline for City BBQ as they've got pretty much all the standards one wants from a cue joint.  Brisket, pulled pork, chicken, ribs, sausages, even turkey which not every place offers on the every day menu.  

The first time we were feeding a small group and ordered \"The Motherload\" to get a taste of all they had to offer and it was a good call.  This is real BBQ, smoked on site over hardwood and they hit the mark.  Pretty much the only negative I can say about the meat relates to consistency.  After multiple to-go orders the moistness mark can be hit or miss on the brisket.  Beyond that though, all signs point to yes!

While meat should always be the star at a BBQ restaurant, the quality of the sides is important as well so a few comments on those.  The potato salad may be my favorite of all time. I wish they offered creamy coleslaw vs just sweet vinegar.  I say they should skip the fancy spring mix in the side salad and go with plain ole iceberg.  Hushpuppie's should be free wherever BBQ is served!  

Finally, their online ordering system is slick and easy, you can get delivery via Door Dash and when you go to the restaurant the staff is friendly."}
