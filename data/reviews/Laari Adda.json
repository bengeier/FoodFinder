{"text":"I would have given this place 0 starts if it were possible. Heard a lot of good things so decided to try it but it was such a disappointment, would have walked out. We had a guest who was vegetarian and took them there. We checked out the menu and there was only one vegetarian option(Cauliflower tots), that's fine so we go to order and they ran out. That was okay too, then the server mentioned there is another option the bun Kabab and they said it only has alu and the bun. They brought out all our food and then we opened the bun kabab and it looked like it had egg in it so we just kindly asked the server to replace it because they said there was only alu in it. They take it back to the kitchen and another server comes out and hands it back to us, literally in 10seconds. So we asked them if they remade it or just took out the egg because they brought it out seconds later and they said yes they did just take out the egg and brought it back. Then we asked them again can you please remake another one cuz our guest does not eat egg and the new server rudely says that's what you ordered so that's what I brought. Instead of just taking it back, replacing it or apologizing they blame us for ordering it when we clearly only ordered it with the potato and the bun. We would have walked out but our guest insisted we stay. This was the first and last time I will ever be visiting this location."}
{"text":"Please note this is my and my review only. 
We went to Laari Adda last night. We went around 720 we were seated by 730 several different servers came by to bring water and ask how we were doing and finally someone came to take our order. After they took our order we did not receive our food till 9 o'clock. We ordered several things off the menu and they came staggered. The prices are pretty expensive for very small portions of street food. Overall the food tasted pretty good. Once my husband and I got home we both had stomach aches all night. I will definitely not be going back to this restaurant. I currently still have a tummyache."}
{"text":"Sad experience .. price is duble, serving size half of peers .. food tasted nice, but not something which will take me back again ..ordered butter chicken, nihari and chicken boti .. startled by serving size, for the price .. embarrassing when you invite someone over .. hope they make changes, else I doubt they will run for long."}
{"text":"Disappointed!!!
Went with enthusiasm. Left Sad.
Laari Adda is a new player in Mississauga , catering Pakistani style street food snacks with a limited number of entree items. (Laari Adda is normally a truck or bus stand where people gather to enjoy street style folk food).

N.B.: It has no relationship with its namesake in Pakistan, and may even be encroaching on the Pakistani brand . 

Such Pakistani places are as yet rare in Canada but  seems that the trend is emerging. 

This was our 2nd visit. First one was a little better. 

It opens from 5 PM to 12 AM daily, and becomes quite busy on weekends and some week evenings. Place is small and line ups of Generation Z and Millennials may be there and wait may be as long as an hour.

It may take at least 30/45 minutes from order to service. And servings may be staggered even if ordered together. 

We ordered Gol Gappay as starters , which are round , fluffy, crispy shells that can be filled with chickpeas and garnishes and can be further filled with spiced water that is normally knowns as Paani (hence paani puri at many South Asian snack places). These were quiet tasty, and closer to authentic Pakistani taste. Paani is served in shot glasses for each shell. Which is a new take as compared to other places serving the same snack. 

From the starters we also ordered Garlic French Fries, and Chargha Chicken wings (chicken wings made with spices and the style of Chargha, which in  pashto language  is chicken and this dish is influenced by streets of Pakistan and Punjab. Normally marinated overnight and served deep fried). Both were decent.

At  the earlier visit we ordered Nihari( a slow cooked beef shank curry), and Daal Maash ( a special lentil). Both were decent.

On this visit we ordered : Bun Kabab (Pakistani style burger), quite decent: Koyla Butter Chicken (Butter chicken with something to do with charcoal), So So ; Haryali Chicken (grilled chicken with may be mint marination) So So. 

What made this and earlier visit disappointing was the erratic service. 
There are several young servers who make a show of providing decent service but that may be just a facade.

One of my guests ordered a Cold Coffee and requested that it be served first and at least with appetizer. It did not come for at least 45 minutes and came after multiple reminders  when the appetizers were over. 

We ordered 2 Naans , one with butter and one without . I do not eat buttered Naan. Only one naan came with the entree. I could not start as the non buttered Naan did not come till after multiple follow ups and reminders. 

After the meal I ordered a Kashmiri Chai (Kashmiri style tea). After about 10 minutes of ordering , the server came back to ask if we needed a bill or wanted to order something else. She simply forgot the tea order. It took another 10 minutes for the tea to come which was nothing like a Kashmiri Chai.

One of the servers was absolutely rude and her attitude was quite annoying as she screamed the name of Bun Kabab, and gesticulated when we requested her to make space to place the food. 

The only grace was the attitude of the restaurant manager, whose name began with F. He was quite welcoming at both visits and is probably trying his best when the servers and kitchen are failing him.

The place is known to provide board games, but we are not sure about the process. 

To be objective , I will visit this place once again. Observe any improvement and edit the review or write a follow up. If no change, will not return ever."}
{"text":"I came from Washington DC to visit Toronto, heard about this place so I went to visit. Few things I noticed about this place.
1- best falooda
2- gol gappay not just fresh and tasty but fun to eat them as they are gol gappay shots.
3- food is so good, that it's always crowded and there is a wait for like half hr, but that wait is worth it.
4- people serving you are so friendly and looks like they are having fun
5- masalah fires are good
Would definitely recommend this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"Did take out, it was okay. I ordered the chicken jalepeno rolls, it was not rlly good, basically tastes like cream cheese poppers with chilli and shredded chicken. But customer service was very nice!! I would go for dine in:)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is amazing..and not only that but the food and service was great. Definitely recommend to anyone who wants to try a unique experience. My only critic is they should give more gol guppas in the order."}
{"text":"I was extremely impressed with this place, it's hard to find authentic, clean and tasty Pakistani restaurants in my opinion. Laari Adda was amazing, the food and the service were beyond expectation. The portions of the meals are perfect for two people and reasonably priced. 
They provided complimentary snacks and drinks at Iftaar time and it wasn't just any snacks.. pakoras and samosas :) 

Amazing place.. will be returning next weekend :)"}
{"text":"Really cool spot to hang out at with mouth watering food. We tried the nihari, ras malai and falooda. All were great. The games added to our night and we all enjoyed. Wait time was long, but they will hopefully fix that soon."}
{"text":"Finally tried out this place after the turbaned man on the wall mural had gone viral on social media. This place blew my expectations in terms of quality of food. The portion sizes were great. We ordered a couple sides (gol guppy shots, chicken & cheese rolls and a puri paratha roll to be shared between two people. It was filling for a snack. I'd order a main in you're very hungry. Otherwise there are plenty of sides to try. We each had a karak chai and Kashmiri chai. Delish! The service was friendly and quick. I'm looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Luckily went a little early as this place is small and gets busy quick but the decor is amazing and the menu is very unique as I've never tried Pakistani food before.

The server was friendly and helpful in explaining the menu.  I started with their regular chai tea and it was excellent and then shared a naan chicken pizza which was also excellent with really gooey cheese and the chicken cheese rolls which were spicy but tasty.

Seeing the dishes come out of the kitchen made me want to try everything, especially the buns section of the menu.  Definitely coming back to try more!"}
{"text":"Visited Lari Adda on Canada day, after the fireworks, reached their around 11PM, was seated in 10 min, that was impressive as the other reviews mentioned long wait time, may be we were just lucky as once we got seated, lot of people showed up.
The food was served in 15 min, that was impressive too. Taste was hit or miss, the spicy wings was great, but the bun Kabab was absolutely blend and without any taste, the tomatoes were stale and smelly. Chicken booti was soft and tender but v.v. spicy. Also ordered gola ganda that was ok. While waiting for our last item, Faluda,  we had a really disgusting experience, there was a employee was cleaning the floor with a broom and afterwards he put it in the corner and without washing his hands bought us the Faluda, his actions totally put us off and we refused to take it from him, we complained to the manager who never took it seriously and said 'oh today we have a full house and it's really crowded so that's why he didn't wash his hands, we were like WT*, this made us wonder what else is going on in the kitchen, maybe when it's too crowded that don't wash hand after visiting washroom.
Not planning on going there again."}
{"text":"So lucky to live so close to this place. A much needed resto-lounge for the neighbourhood.  Yes, the service was great and food was authentic and delicious but I fell just absolutely inlove with the vibe. We ordered nihari, butter chicken and chicken tikka- all we very good. Beware, it's busy even on weeknights. I actually think I want to live here...please?"}
{"text":"The pricing of the menu and small gratuity for a group of 7 threw us off. We had a group of 10, and didnt expect it. For a pakistani place in the Mississuaga area this is one of the more expensive ones. 

At first they brought three of the nine orders at one time and ten minutes later brought the other four meals (biryani). As a family you don't eat until everyone does so, this was something I observed.

The order included:

Gol Goppa Shots (6 included) 
Chargha Wings (10 wings)
Chicken tikka pizza (a size small) 
4 biryanis 
Butter chicken and rice 
Bun kabob and masala fries 
Chicken Tikka 
4 butter naans
4 puris parathas 

Gol Goppa Shots:
It was good and was liked, however in comparison to Gerrard street gol gappay, they weren't better. A 3/5.

Chargha wings:
The wings were small but we're tasty, tasted like fried chicken wings. Flavour is 5/5.

Biryani:
The black pepper seed and clove flavour in the biryani was overpowering, it was sub-par compared to other biryani places in my opinion however others who had it in our group said it reminded them of home. Wouldn't recommend. The biryani wasn't oily, but was decent. A solid 4/5

Chicken pizza:
Friends recalled it's something their mom made at home, basically naan with chicken ketchup and cheese. The pizza was 3.5/5.

Bun Kabob and Masala Fries:
The kabob was pretty underseasoned, the chaat masala was noticeable in the burger and the fries was lightly sprinkled with chaat masala, I wish it was warmer when it came though. 

Update: the bun kabob wrecked my stomach, no one else experienced it with their food. (Score 2/5) 

Chicken Tikka:
It was dry rub chicken tikka very balance in flavour not too spicy and not too bland a solid 4/5."}
{"text":"We came here for iftar on the first weekend of Ramadan, which was also a long weekend, so I think they were extra busy. FYI, their Ramadan hours are different than their regular hours, so make sure you check beforehand on their Facebook page - in Ramadan, it seems they open for the night at 8 PM, and a lineup started forming around 7:40. Because we were there early and stood in the line, it was easy to get a table; however, the restaurant was jam-packed with many different groups. We were still able to get a good sense of the Laari Adda experience though, and I have to say, I loved it! 

First off, the ambiance! The lighting, the decor, the Coke Studio music playing in the background, the servers that take your order in Urdu. Amazing! 

We were attended to very quickly. Our server approached us and took our order right away soon after we were seated at 8 PM. In Urdu, no less, which was really special. Don't stress if your Urdu isn't that great - they are able to explain everything in English as well, and you might learn a new word or two. 

I appreciated that the server asked us if our order was for iftar, or if we wanted it before iftar. Looking around the restaurant, it seemed like most people were there for iftar, but I wasn't fasting and was very hungry, and I was happy that they were able to rush and get me part of my order before iftar time!  My husband, on the other hand, was fasting, and once we told the server that, we also got plenty of water, dates, pakoras, samosas and rooh afza (I think? It tasted like rooh afza mixed in with some pop, but seemed like more of an orange in colour) complimentary for iftar, which was a really nice touch. It seems everybody in the restaurant got this too, and it was nice that we were all taken care of before iftar! Because for 5 mins at iftar time, things did slow down for a bit, as all the servers were taking a quick few minutes to break their fasts as well. 

In terms of food, we ordered the chicken cheese jalapeno rolls, mango lassi, beef bihari paratha roll, koyla butter chicken, and chicken dum biryani, all of which we really enjoyed. The rolls were particularly good. The mango lassi comes with the option of adding whipped cream. The beef bihari roll was a tad too spicy for me, so I kept dipping it in the raita that came with the biryani, but I'm sure I could ask for it to be slightly less spicy next time. My husband really enjoyed his butter chicken and biryani, though he did note that the biryani is not really biryani (he is Hyderabadi, however, and generally not a fan of Pakistani biryani).  

A few notes: 
1) It doesn't seem there is a space to pray, so you can bring your own prayer mat and ask for a corner to pray maghrib in, or pray in your car.  
2) Also, if you're in a rush to eat so you can get to tarawih, you will have to flag your server down to get your bill. Otherwise, it seems they are happy to let you linger for as long as you want, which makes it an ideal spot for a date night! 
3) We didn't get any of the games that I'd heard they have, like Ludo? But we also didn't ask. 
4) Bathrooms could be a little cleaner. 

Overall, really enjoyed Laari Adda and will be back again and again for more date nights in the future, and to try some of the other things on their menu - that sehri menu looks tempting!"}
{"text":"Great ambience and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Laari Adda is a must go! It is a very fun restaurant, the vibe is amazing, the staff is very friendly as well. There's a lot of funny and great art on the wall to look at. I came with 8 friends on a busy night and had to wait 40 minutes to get seated. There's food on the menu for whatever mood your in. We ordered Gol Gappay Shots, Chicken Strips, Chapli Burgers and Tandoori Chicken Naan Wraps, and ended it with gulab jamuns. Everything was superb, definitely will come back to try their unique meals like chicken naan pizza and chicken dum biryani. Best part about Laari Adda is that they have Ludo so you can eat and play with your friends!"}
{"text":"Went with my family - loved the decor and ambiance. The food was also off the charts! Can't wait to return - would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Went there about 2 months ago, after a hell of wait time and being seated, ordered for our children and us, but the order didn't come after 45 min, upon questioning they said it's not in their system, we felt compelled not to cancel the order and leave because it was midnight and we had no other option, any ways food cane and was good, nihari was specially v good but the problem is that the staff never felt sorry for what happened and charged us fully including service charges."}
