{"text":"Great for tourists and the food is amazing. They have a wide selection from sandwiches and salads. The service was amazing with such a busy atmosphere, although the seating is a bit crowded the food will not disappoint. This is a must visit place!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on an early Saturday morning so I was not surprised that it was packed. This place was recommended to by our Airbnb host as one of the best bagel places in Montreal. Overall I think that the bagel was fresh and pleasant but I wish I had ordered the poppyseed instead of the normal sesame seed that it comes with (just being picky). Even the cream cheese that comes with the bagel is nice and fluffy. The bread was fresh and the smoked salmon was a delight! Would definitely recommend to any friends who want to experience real bagels"}
{"text":"Thank heavens for its 24hr convenience! We got into st. Viateur at 4;30am to the sweet smell of fresh bagels! The service was bare, cash only service! There was sesame bagels available! We ended up grabbing a half a dozen, and ate it right there outside the store. It was warm and delicious! We added some cream cheese on the side for added Taste. Will definitely come back to try other types here!"}
{"text":"Je voudrai simplement commencer par dire que la nourriture etait excellente. J'avais pris le bagel traditionnel avec une salade de coeurs d'artichaud. Sur la qualité du repas, je n'ai rien à dire. Par contre, la qualité du service laissait à désirer. Personne ne nous a accueilli lorsque nous sommes entrés dans le resto. Pas un bonjour, meme pas un sourir de la part de notre serveuse Marie-lou. Elle n'a fait que nous lancer les menus sur la table sans meme nous regarder. Elle n'est meme jamais revenu nous voir pour s'assurer que tout était bon lorsque nous avobs recu nos assiettes. En tant que client, ce sont les petits details du genre qui ne me donnent pas le gout de revenir une deuxieme fois. Je prefere quasiment aller au starbucks où je me sens le bienvenu."}
{"text":"Absolument tout sur le menu est un vrai delice!!!!! Seul petit probleme, il y a toujours trops de monde., mais ca vaut la peine d'attendre!!!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a Montreal Bagel and a salad and we were very happy with what we found at St-Viateur. 

I ordered the Greek Salad with poppy seed bagel. the salad was huge...a mountain of tomatoes, yellow peppers, onions and olives, with massive triangles of feta cheese were delivered to the table in a matter of minutes after ordering.
The salad came with \"bagel chips\" I wasn't entirely sure what that meant ...so i ordered a bagel on the side. Bagel chips, i will tell you are basically an over toasted bagel served cold and very crunch!  I am glad i had my side order of freshly toasted delicious bagel!

food...good, service...good, price ...not so much...it was a little over priced but 2 outta 3 aint bad! :)"}
{"text":"I was only in Montreal for a day (work) and I HAD to eat a bagel. I mean...who would go to Vancouver and not eat sushi...who would go to Winnipeg and not eat a mosquito...? Bagels HAD to be eaten.
I ordered a huge salad with smoked salmon, capers, cucumbers, and cream cheese...I think it was called the Delox Salad. I also got a bagel on the side...even though it came with \"bagel chips\" (FYI- not really \"chips\" but thinly sliced, very toasted bagels...)
SUPER yummy...
The menu includes both breakfast and lunch, no matter what time youi visit. I totally reccomend this if you are in the NDG Montreal area and are craving some yummy carbs!
I also ordered a chai latte....and it was SUPER good."}
{"text":"Last time I went the coffee was cold and stale, and the waitress was sitting down watching the wold cup.  Now, I'm not a sports fan, so I can't understand how important the game is to her.  That being said, if you give me crappy old coffee, and then ignore my passive-aggressive looks in your direction...  You get a lower Yelp! rating than before.  Sorry, just think of Yelp! like the world cup and you'll understand."}
{"text":"I go to this restaurant very often for breakfast. The food is very good, the service is very good, and the drinks are good, too. I recommend this restaurant for brunch."}
{"text":"This a cozier location and a bit crowded but I soon discovered why. I had the 2 Eggs and sesame bagel which was fantastic. What I didn't expect was how good the coffee was too. The pricing is more than fair and excellent bilingual service. Would definitely return to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"Delicious and accessible, I come to this place practically every time I visit Montreal. Though the lines get long after 11 it is with good reason: the bagels are baked fresh in a huge oven, and emerge thin, doughy and just a little chewy. 

Service is consistently good, and the coffee is refilled before you can finish a cup. The bagel toppings, eggs, bacon and sides lack creativity, but the ingredients are of high quality, and highlight the main reason you came to St. Viateur in the first place."}
{"text":"Had the Club Bagel with a tossed salad. The salad isnt worth mentioning, but the sandwich was AWESOME. It was stuffed with smoked turkey and other toppings. The bagel was chewy, light and thin. We had a table near the open window at the Mont Royal location. It was a beautiful day and we got to enjoy a pitcher of sangria for $20 with our meal....The service was fast, bilingual and friendly. 
Would definately make the trip back if Im in Montreal again."}
{"text":"The classic place to buy/eat Bagels in Montreal"}
{"text":"If you've never had their Rosemary bagel, you're really missing something special. Blueberry and Poppyseed are never bad choices either.  Make sure that you're carrying cash when you visit."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying a Montréal bagel, especially after getting a taste of wood-fired bagels in Ottawa at Kettleman's. St. Viateur was disappointing - I got a multi-grain bagel with regular cream cheese. The bagel had that great wood-fired crunch, but the texture was dry and the flavor was extremely bland, like the bagel was no-salt-added. The location and shop itself were great. We had a nice time, but I wouldn't go back for a bagel."}
{"text":"Great food and great value for your money! Fairly quick service though if you happen to go first thing in the morning things tends to move a little slow."}
{"text":"I'm not a bagel expert, but I have to say the bagels here are really good. My favourite is sesame - love it with plain cream cheese & smoked salmon. The bagels come fresh out of the oven. Last time they forgot my order, and the guy gave me 6 free to take home! Yay!"}
{"text":"I love to get the one with prosciuto and pesto with a smoothie. It's a bit on the pricey side for bagels though. The service is alright, it's what you'd expect cause it's always so busy."}
{"text":"VERY disappointed. Visited to get a bagel to go (after buying their bagels ever since I moved to Montreal this was a no brainer ). Unfortunately, after waiting at least 5 minutes trying to get an employees attention(at least 15 people working) once I asked an employee to get a bagel to go they responded by yelling \"tabernack!\" To my face 3 times. Left immediately. Never going back."}
{"text":"I never met a carbohydrate I didn't like, and bagels are no exception. It is near-impossible to find a good bagel in my town, so I was very excited to learn that the apartment we were staying in was located above a bagel shop! Let me tell you, waking up to the smell of freshly baked bagels is a great way to start the day.

Our first visit was for a late dinner. I had a bagel sandwich that involved ham and pesto, along with a side salad. It was delicious, but the bagel played second fiddle to the tasty fillings, so I knew we had to come back to try some bagels on their own. 

I had a cinnamon raisin bagel with cream cheese - pretty basic, but it's the standard by which I judge any bagel purveyor. Note: the seating in the shop is only if you want table service. So we were forced to take our bagels to go, and intended to find a suitable place to consume them. But they smelled so good that we stood right outside on the sidewalk and scarfed them down. It was pretty great. 

So even if you can't have the pleasure of sleeping above a bagel shop, St-Viateur is worth a stop!"}
{"text":"good prices, good service, nice ambience, great deck for summer and even fall days. overall, 7/10 for me."}
{"text":"I was told I had to have a Montreal bagel and this was the place. I agree, the bagel was great and the slight sweetness from being boiled with honey was there and it was nice. But, there were a few things lacking. The service was slow and the food took quite a while to arrive. I thought the menu needed more options other than sandwiches, salads, and bagels with spreads. I wanted to really try a bagel, so not in a sandwich, but if I did that my options were slim. To me a great bagel/breakfast place has plates with eggs and meat and a bagel instead of toast. I looked at the menu and tried to put that together, but I couldn't. 

All in all, I thought the bagel was very good, but it was not the spotlight when it's holding together a sandwich. There was no way I could have eaten the extra bagel you can order with the sandwich for $0.95."}
{"text":"No credit card accepted, no worth the long wait. Food was cold. My recommendation will be to take your bagel itself to your home and prepare it yourself. Bagels are really good."}
{"text":"The service was okay. Took them a while to assign a table outside.
 if you're going to eat outside in the fall/winter, bring a sweater because its kind of annoying to eat with your winter coat. 

The food is great, really good and fresh bagels and cream cheese. I ordered a omelette with a raisin bagel but i got a sesame bagel. I din't make a fuss about it and i ate the sesame, it was good as well. Overall the food is great but 40$ for 1 omelette/bagel and a morning bagel is a bit expensive"}
{"text":"Service was lacklustre. Food was delicious with simple ingredients. All around a good experience at a decent price.

Would come back if I were in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Good salads and bagels. Not friendly staff and no internet. I don't recommend the Chai latté nor the biscuits."}
{"text":"Waitresses were very friendly and attentive. I had a plain bagel with lox and it was delicious. The bagel itself was crunchy on the outside and nice and chewy on the inside. I tried a slice of my boyfriend's everything or as they call it, the \"all dressed\". It was the best everything bagel we ever had! 

P.S. Canadian CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"Best bagels in town, hands down. The restaurant is a no-frills, unpretentious place that's great for families. Nice place to have coffee in the afternoon--especially on the patio, which is heated when necessary. I can't comment on lunch and dinner, which I've never had there. Don't go there for breakfast if you're looking for something special, but if you're not too picky you'll come out feeling that you had your money's worth. Staff is always friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Good place for brunch and I can consider it very cheap comparing to other brunch restaurant. The portion was generous and off course the taste was amazing. Unfortunately, it's not a place for big family or to hang out since it's very busy and many lines-up. Don't forget to have the bagel to go."}
{"text":"Un vrai régal. Les bagels sont délicieux, et il y en a vraiment pour tous les goûts. On choisit jusqu'au type de pain et les salades d'accompagnement (originales et très bonnes). Les petits détails qui ont achevé de me conquérir : la panthere rose en continu sur la télevision, et des peintures dans les qui valent un détour au petit coin même si on en a pas besoin :-)"}
{"text":"Super super et super du prix au service au baguel une merveille on c est régaler et c est en endroit en voir , de voir les Bagel sortir de se four immense c est juste génial :)"}
{"text":"Was just trying to decide what we wanted via window browsing. The person manning the shop tapped the window with her knife and \"shooed\" us away. Although I heard this place was good, I will not be going here simply from the rude and potentially discriminatory customer service."}
{"text":"Best bagels I've ever had! Bagels, in general, are never my first choice because the only version I knew was the doughy dense kind. But these were light, toasted to a perfect crisp on the outside and made it an easy choice to eat more than one. The place itself is small and bustling with people in the know. Friendly service and good food. A big eatery highlight of our visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"AMAZING experience here - both with the food and the service.

For starters, we came here to eat twice during a 3 day trip. The first time we came, I got a classic sesame bagel with cream cheese -- I was set on comparing this bagel to my NY bagels. It was great! Totally different but in an awesome way. On our last visit, we got some dinner and a half a dozen bagels to bring back to our family in New York because we loved them so much.

This cafe was our last stop before hitting the road back to the states.... about 3 hours into our drive, we stopped to get gas and I realized I left my small bag with my credit card, license and $200 sunglasses at this cafe. Obviously frantic, I contacted the owner at another location (it was 10PM and this location was closed), he was very kind and directed me to his brother who owns the Mont Royal spot. I spoke to him the next day and surprisingly they had my bag with ALL my stuff in it. 

Not only did they ship it to me that same week, they contacted me several times giving me shipping options (shipping from Canada is more expensive than waiting for them to come to the US a few days later to ship, etc.), sending me my tracking code, all for zero cost. \"Just come visit us the next time you're in Montreal,\" the owner said. 

Oh we definitely will! Great people, great food :)"}
{"text":"Best bagels I've ever tasted...always fresh out of the oven...hot and yummy, the sesame ones are the best."}
{"text":"Delicious bagels!!! Definitely had to wait a while for a table but it was worth it. I had the hard boiled egg sandwich which I might not get again cause it was a little dry. Still loved the overall experience though. Decent drip coffee and free refills. Nice staff."}
{"text":"The freshly made bagels are incredible. Personally, I only like the sesame bagels, but that's personal preference. However, eating there is quite costly. Each bagel dish is at least $10, and even though they are good, the ingredients are nothing that I can't do myself, and for a much cheaper cost.  The bagels though are like nothing to be found elsewhere."}
{"text":"Lived around the corner from Beigel Bake on Brick Lane in London for years. Their traditional Jewish bagels are the best I've had anywhere in Europe or North America. 
St-Viateur is pretty good. The bagels are good and far better than anything you'd get in a coffee shop chain or supermarket. 
Reading Ash M's review I'm guessing she was correct and the staff were talking about her. Service in St-Viateur ranges from lukewarm to blatantly contemptuous.  
I've heard the staff gossiping about customers a couple of times."}
{"text":"Deliciousness! Came here after reading an article in the National Geographic and it really is incredible. Cozy atmosphere, super nice wait staff (who are bilingual by the way), and yummy food.

I ordered the traditional bagel - which is smoked salmon, cream cheese, onions and capers - on a poppy seed bagel. Also got a moccachino which was so smooth and not too sweet. 

This was definitely worth the extra drive to sit at the cafe instead of the other stores where you can only buy the bagels to go."}
{"text":"First of all, I will admit the bagels are great.  They have done a great job with the classic bagel and cream cheese breakfast.  However, the cafe lacks in the bagel sandwich department.  The omelet used on the bagel was mixed in a bowl then cooked in a microwave.  Personally, this is not my ideal way to cook an egg, especially when it costs $10 for a bagel sandwich with an omelet and spread.   Also, Yelp, they do not accept credit cards.  They only accept debit cards and even so, a Visa debit card was not accepted (for Americans planning on going).  I know that does not sound like a big deal, however, the manger was very rude when we tried to pay with our American debit card and her attitude really ruined the meal for us.

The St-Viateur Bagel shop a few blocks away was pleasant.  It is simple, bagels and cream cheese, that is it!  What else do you need?"}
{"text":"Awesome bagels!! The hype was definitely real. I got the lox on a sesame bagel and I have to say, the bagel is better than the ones in New York! Only issue I had was it was cash only which is weird because every where in the city takes credit cards. Other than the credit card issue, everything about the bagel is as good as advertised"}
{"text":"I highly, highly recommend this place. Everyone is friendly and there is a good amount of seating. However, the food falls into a category of its own. For Americans, these bagels differ from the ones back home, as here they are denser and crispier on the outside. One would think this would make them harder to bite into, but on the contrary, the bagels are the perfect softness because of how fresh they are. Out of what we ordered, the traditional (smoked salmon, cream cheese, onions, capers, and lemon) was the best. If you're debating whether or not to go here- stop your debating and drop by. The food is amazing."}
{"text":"The bagel is good, but the sandwiches and salads are disappointing. The prices are high for the low quality of food, some of which seemed straight out of a jar. The lack of good service was also disappointing. I would come here only to get the bagels, and not bother with waiting for a table for mediocre sandwiches/salads and bad service."}
{"text":"I went for a tour to get some bagels, in the most iconic bagel place in montreal. 

At first, I would give it a 5 stars just for the good bagels. 
But then, once I tried the restaurant, the experience was totally different.  It was disappointing. 

Prices are very very very affordable. You can enjoy a meal for only $25 for 2 persons.
When it comes to the presentation, it was terrible. They do not make any effort in presenting their platters. I believe that they can serve affordable platers in a nicer way. 

In addition to the above, I do believe that  the restrooms are also a clear representation of the cleanliness of a restaurant. They were very dirty. Lets not forget the decoration that is ugly as well.

In conclusion, the restaurant makes no effort in improving its image. It relies only on its good bagels. And hence, I would only recommend this place for pick up bagels only."}
{"text":"These poor things taste more like something early colonists would have carried in their covered wagons for rations than actual bagels. I've been told that apparently Montreal bagels are better than most any other because they are prepared in such a way that sucks every last bit of flavor out of them, leaving you with a gaping ring of dough that tastes like solidified tap water. I don't get it. \"Ooh but they're boiled in honey water, that's what makes them different!!\" Cute. Honey water. The pics looked delicious and I was ready to tear into these amazing bagels everyone had been raving to me about. But I could feel all of that hype just leave the minute I bit into one. They're OKAY, as in the texture of crispy-outer- bagel-meets-chewy-inner-bagel was decent. But seriously, all of the jam or butter or lox or cheese on the planet could never save these poor little things. Why do you lie to yourself, Montreal!? WHY!? Over hyped to the extreme. And yeah yeah I know you're thinking I'm some crusty jerk that hates nice things. I assure you that I LOVE food to an often unhealthy degree. But I do want you to try these bagels. Do it. Right now. Take a big bite and then go look at yourself, alone, in the mirror and HONESTLY ask yourself if that was worth every article you've read about the \"amazing Montreal bagels that even top NY bagels\". St. Viateur is...an emotional experience to say the least. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Been here twice in the past few days. The first time ate lunch from the breakfast menu and it was very good - generous portions and tasty. Second time ate from the lunch menu and it was excellent! Amazing bagel sandwiches with a choice of sides including some awesome - and unique - salad choices. Being able to bring home freshly baked bagels an added bonus!"}
{"text":"We had the traditional and the smoked meat bagel platters and loved both - the thinner, less dense bagels were a nice change from our NY standards (almost shared a third between us)...

Diner-y, low-key space, friendly service..."}
{"text":"We sat down here and split a bagel with cream cheese. It was tasty ... we're used to NYC bagels, and comparing them to Montreal bagels is comparing apples to oranges. Montreal bagels are sweet and dense. 

I'm glad I tried it. I'm just not used to this kind of bagel. Plus the price was pretty high for one bagel and two hot drinks. 

Service was very friendly."}
{"text":"I loved visiting this Cafe. I bought a dozen bagels for around $9 and also sat down to have one bagel for breakfast for around $11 (huh?).  There are two different counters, one for buying bagels by the half dozen or more, and the other counter is to have a bagel dressed to go (BLT, cream cheese, etc). I choose to sit down and enjoy table service.

My order was taken quickly and my food came soon after that. The BLT I ordered also came with a tea/coffee and a bowl of fruit. It was soooo yummy. The staff I encountered were all very friendly, the service was excellent here. 

The bagels I bought to-go were all I could smell on the ride home and it was heavenly."}
{"text":"The place is nice, atmosphere is dark and cozy. The blazing hot brick oven at centre stage was goin the whole time as they were trudging out sesame bagel after sesame bagel. Kinda cool to see how they do they're thing. Pricey for sure and ultimately we both feel like Montreal bagels were definitely more hype than anything else. We'll take our Toronto bagels just fine thanks. Not worth the trip really..."}
{"text":"Excellent place as either a local or a tourist. These bagels are delicious!"}
{"text":"Good place for a really healthy breakfast or brunch. Bagel is served with very fresh and tasty salad. You can add a bagel for just 1$. I just don't like the idea of heating bagels. They should be hot straight from wood oven or just cold. But for my first Montreal bagel experience it was almost perfect apart from that it's a no credit card place what caused me some problems. They should warn you when you order not when you pay."}
{"text":"I love their bagels so much. Actually the size was small but it was so fresh and delicious!! I couldn't stop eating. I prefer sesame bagel. This bagel is totally different one in the US because they use a special oven, not electronic one. Also it was good to see how they make bagels in the kitchen."}
{"text":"A very good spot to get breakfast or lunch. 

I went with the traditional.... lox, cream cheese, raw onion, capers, tomato, on a sesame seed bagel.  Everything was very fresh and tasty.

I was informed before going to Montreal that there bagels were sweet due to the use of honey during the production.  A little different than anything I've ever had.... but very tasty.

The staff is very friendly.  Menus are available in French and English.

Recommend!"}
{"text":"Fast service, good food did not like how the waitress stopped me to ask for a tip not knowing if I was going to tip her"}
{"text":"Bagels, Bagels and More Bagels!  When you are in Montreal, you must try a Montreal bagel!  St-Viateur is one of the known bagel places in the city and my SO and I happenned to stumble across one of their locations in the Mont Royal area.  We picked up a dozen bagels ($7), 6 sesame and 6 poppy seed.  The best part was they packed freshly baked sesame bagels in our dozen.  

This St-Viateur location has a sit down area where you can grab some eats and coffee.  The food looked good and the place was packed.  Looks like I might have to come back and try out their menu.

Make St-Viateur your bagel stop whenever you are in Montreal."}
{"text":"Pains me to admit it but Montreal has the best bagels, better than Ess-a, better than H&H. Crazy right?

This place is very Ess-a-bagel-esque, minimalist in presentation, delicious in taste, a no frills mouth adventure.

Montreal is surprisingly also very good for, steak, smoked meats, maple syrup and turning out TV show hosts. 

Do not ever take the train there from Manahattan, you will die!"}
{"text":"A Montreal must, the famed Montreal bagel - like a NY bagel, but slightly smaller, denser and sweeter. The traditional flavors are poppy and sesame, but the rosemary salt is unique and delicious. 

If you'd like to sit down I'd recommend going early because the line stretches out he door. However, you can also pop to the back and grab bagels to go fairly quickly. 

Cash only so bring your Canadian dollars or you'll be slightly ripped off on the USD exchange rate."}
{"text":"Belle ambiance, excellent service!  Personnel accueillant et très attentionné!  Les bagels sont délicieux et très frais.  Prix raisonnable!"}
{"text":"I actually had to google how bagels in Montreal were made because I could not believe how awesome they were after I ate here.  A few years ago, I had Fairmount, and loved it, but can't really compare because of the time lapse.

I had about five bagels (yes, i realize i looked like a typical gluttonous american tourist, but i didn't have a lil bag on my waist)  and found they taste great plain, which, in my opinion, is a true measure of quality.  

The only thing i noticed the popeye bagels must have been fresh out of the oven because they were very warm, where the others weren't.  I preferred the warm ones, but by no means didn't like the others."}
{"text":"When in Montreal, this place is a must.  Their bagels are great, but I do prefer NY bagels.  I don't care for the sweetness of the bagels in Montreal.  I had a BLT Bagel sandwich that was yummy.  This place is super quaint as well."}
{"text":"Real star of the place was the (locally imported) crack in a cup smoked salmon cream cheese spread.

Bagels were perfectly toasted and complemented well, but honestly I could've dipped a dried up piece of sponge in the salmon cream cheese and it would've tasted orgasmic."}
{"text":"Montreal bagels are always full of win. This Montreal bagel deli rocks. I recommend the roast beef sandwich for lunch. On the weekend come by and pick up a dozen bagels, smoked salmon and creme-cheese and head back home for a feast."}
{"text":"So good! Every Montreal travel blog said we had to try this bagel shop. After visiting NYC, I wasn't sure that these bagels would be super impressive but I was definitely wrong! I tried the everything (all dressed they called it here) bagel with regular cream cheese and it was delicious! My boyfriend had a bagel sandwich and a sesame with strawberry cream cheese. The strawberry was a little too sweet for my liking but still excellent if that is your preference. The specialty coffees were amazing and adorable in their special glass mugs. Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"I had read so many reviews about this place before I left for my weekend to Montreal, i had even decided what I wanted to try.... The smoked salmon of course!

And yet when I got there and was waiting in line to be seated I found myself questioning my choice. I was so tempted but the other options. After half an hour I finally decided I wanted the Milano (Sausage and peppers). As we place our order I can't help but ask the waitress what her preference is (I do this too often!) and she says 'Smoked Salmon!' and so last minute I change to order to the salmon. 

The rest of the table tried the Milano (ok.. not their best), Spicy Eggplant (really good) and the chicken (I didn't try that). I think its safe to say that my Salmon won hands down followed by the Eggplant. I could clearly see why so many people have reviewed it. The smoked salmon was really good (a bit too much cream cheese for me, but you can easily scrape some off). 

Bagels are not my favourite but i wouldn't mind trying this place again :)"}
{"text":"Best bagels in Montreal. And as a native New Yorker, YES I DO like these bagels very much! It's a must try."}
{"text":"Alors là, mais alors là!! Que dire de plus que \"ALLEZ TESTEZ\"! 

Tout d'abord, le lieu est accueillant et sympathique. On passe un agréable moment, sans problème! Puis le service est très bien fait. Mais parlons de ce qui se trouve dans nos assiettes! 

Des produits frais, des aliments gouttus, une association de saveurs exquise, une explosion gustative!

Autant j'aime découvrir de nouvelles places et, par conséquent, j'essaie de ne pas retourner dans les mêmes places, mais plutôt me rendre dans différents lieux afin de tester un maximum de choses. Cependant, St-Viateur & Café, on n'aura pas besoin de me tirer le bras pour y revenir. Je le ferais avec plaisir et salive en bord de bouche (désolée pour l'image peu délicate, mais qui exprime tellement bien mon désir d'y retourner)!"}
{"text":"Great Montreal Bagels.

Food: 4/5 Great bagels.
Service: 4/5 fast and fun.
Environment: 4/5 Nice little cafe.
Washrooms: ?/? Didn't go.
Worth it?: 4/5 Worth it if you are looking for a great bagel.

Always part of my Montreal trip. I love picking some back to bring back home to Toronto. I think the cinnamon raisin is my favorite one.

Bagels ideas when you're home:
- sesame bagel with peanut butter and banana. 
- poppy seed bagel with an over easy eggs, mozzarella cheese and spinache.
- plain cinnamon raisin with a coffee.

Let me know if you try any of the above!"}
{"text":"I love St-Viateur. The bagels are the best in MTL, coffee is free with breaky, and the portions are large. It's not that expensive compared to most brunch places and you won't leave feeling ripped off.

I love the smile breakfast, served with an all-dressed bagel. I'm always stuffed after finishing it.

The staff are very friendly and always love to share a laugh with my little boy =P

You can also pick up some bagels around the counter area and get it to go with some cream cheese. Makes for a lovely breakfast at home."}
{"text":"Personally I love the monkland village because it has the perfect atmosphere for a cozy lunch and coffee. Service was friendly, welcoming and very accommodating. I ordered a chicken bagel which comes with the choice of a soup or salad. I ordered the tuna salad, must I say the portion given was 'ginormous'. I noted that there was not a lot of chicken in the bagel but the waiter acted quickly and got the cook to grill me extra one. Overall, it was satisfying but nothing out of the ordinary really. I would Come back here for a cheap 'home-like' lunch."}
{"text":"Well, First off, I'd like to say I've been wanting to try the Montreal style bagel since I've heard about it. Eating bagels from NYC and NJ I have to say i've been pretty spoiled. With that aside, these funny looking bagels give NYC a run for it's money! Unlike the \"traditional\" bagel, these are skinnier bagels with a larger hole in the center, and a sweeter taste. When I was looking into bagels I looked into a variety of places, I chose this location, (avenue du Mont-Royal), for it's location close to the metro. 

This is a cute cafe style shop that has seats and a counter to order from. This place was PACKED on a Sunday. The line was out the door right after we were seated. Then menu has a a wide selection of sandwiches, salads (with bagel chips) and sides. They also offer plain bagels and other baked treats. 

The service was ok, I have to remind myself that it's not NYC and we need to wait.... the owner actually came over and checked on us while waiting (which was nice). While looking over the menu, I chose the polet St-Viateur sandwich, (chicken marinated in lemon and herbs with either pesto or mayo)... I chose pesto with a green salad on the side, sandwich on a sesame bagel. My friend chose the omelet sandwich, eggs with ham (he subbed bacon) and added cheddar. 

Yum! The sandwich was awesome! Only complaint was the bagel was cold. But besides that I got a BIG hunk of chicken on a yummy bagel with a mixed green salad (yummy Dijon vinaigrette). 

The price.... eh, It was worth it, but it wasn't very cheap... 12,50.... but it didn't seem there were any bargains in Montreal. 

I'd seriously recommend this location if in the city. 

P.S. Don't expect a NY style bagel."}
{"text":"Great place to have a coffee with friends, a filling breakfast/lunch or a quick bite. I love the fresh saint-viateur bagels and the great friendly staff. I would definitely recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"St-Viateur bagels are without a doubt some of the best bagels on the planet. This restaurant, however, is a complete joke.

For starters, we waited 15 minutes before getting up and going to ask for a menu ourselves. We then tried to get one of the three waitresses' attention so we could finally order, but still no luck there. All 4 waitresses on duty while we were there completely ignored us. After almost 20min waiting, I got up to ask a waitress for the menu. Then I had to get up once again to order a coffee, AND to order. So just to recap, not one single waitress came to our table. Oh and I also had to ask for water. Once we finally got our meal, both orders were wrong but we were so hungry that we said we'd just eat and pay. Once we waited so long to ask someone for the bill that I almost got up and walked out of the restaurant. It probably would have gone unnoticed but I just couldn't bring myself to do something like that. Crappy service and a total tourist trap, unfortunately."}
{"text":"We walked a very long time to get here.  The line up was also long (which tells me this place must be good).  However the server was very rude and unhelpful... Wow!
I'd say this place is a bit pricy for what you're served and especially given the low level of service.
Even asking for a refill of how water put fear in me... The look I got was unreal, for hot water?  I had a tea for goodness sakes..."}
{"text":"I think I like Montreal bagels better than NY bagels.  Worth stopping in this place or Fairmont Bagels if you are in Montreal."}
{"text":"Coming from Toronto we often eat Gryfe's bagels which are way different.  This was a nice change.  I expected a dense thick bagel but it wasn't and it was just right in density and size.  We got it hot off the line and we out smoked salmon and cream cheese on it.  Too bad there's no chairs or small seating area but there was a table available to assemble our breakfast.  Wish we could bring a few home as it was a nice change from our regular!"}
{"text":"We lucked out and had no wait when we visited - just walked right in and to a table.  By the time we left, though, it was packed!  I'm not sure if/when there is ever a good time to visit to avoid a crowd, but you might get lucky.

I had the breakfast sandwich on a sesame bagel and it was delicious.  We also tried some other bagels and I have to say, all were tasty.

I am someone who loves bread products, and while I'm not sure it was the best bagel I have ever had, it was a bit different in flavor and nice and soft on the inside with a bit of a perfectly hard outside.  I would definitely eat these bagels often if I lived in Montreal.  

Worth a stop if you're in the area and definitely try to get in to take in the experience - hustle and bustle and quick, efficient (and friendly) service."}
{"text":"I couldn't visit Montreal without trying the famed bagels! They were a little sweater than the traditional New York bagel. I tried the sesame with the apple cinnamon cream cheese. The bagel was good but I abandoned the cream cheese in favor of butter half way through. These bagels can really stand on their own!  
The cafe itself was very cute and we enjoyed hanging out for a bit!"}
{"text":"Came to the cafe to get a coffee and a traditional sesame bagel! The traditional is smoke salmon, cream cheese, onions, and capers. 

They don't have cold brew cofffee but it's ok. 

The bagel is good but I don't think I can taste the difference. The bagels were also made right there in the huge oven they had at the cafe! That was exciting to see. 

My friend got the cappuccino and loved it. I just might not be a bagel person but I'm going to pass next time I'm in Montreal and eat other things instead!"}
{"text":"long wait. 1 waiter, 1 hostess, 1 server. 10 people inside the counter assorting what bagel goes on which plate/combo. cramped seatings. take forever to place an order because the 1 waitress is busy. got the Traditional which was the smoked salmon and the Wow which was the spicy eggplant.

choose your bagels wisely. if you're getting a salty protein sandwich, choose a lighter or sweeter bagel. i thought the sesame bagel smelled very fresh. to eat a bagel for 15$ is not quite worth it if you think about it. it is just bagel with one lettuce, cherry tomatoes and a slice of salmon or two. you can make your own. perhaps just get take out bagels for 90cents each and then add your own toppings or eat it plain. don't sit and eat. not worth the time. they don't even appreciate you being there."}
{"text":"Will always remember this place as this was the setting for my introduction to the Montreal bagel. Their wood burning fire produces warm, flaky, crispy bagels with a hint of honey. So flavorful, you can eat it just by itself. We thoroughly enjoyed our 2 sesame bagels with butter and cream cheese. Their coffee wasn't bad either. Memorable breakfast. Nice cafe to hang out.

Only downside is the price. For 2 bagel & extra condiments, we easily went over $6. 

The walk to St Viateur from the metro station made for a great walk through the Mont -Royal neighborhood."}
{"text":"Their bagels are good but not as good as the original store. 

I had the smoked salmon bagel. The cream cheese didn't taste like regular Philadelphia."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what to say about this place... The bagels were ok... I love the fact that you can watch them being made so you know they're gonna be fresh. I felt like they kind of lacked the flavor I was craving though. The staff was interesting, I found that when I walked in they were all standing around talking and I had a weird suspicion they were talking about me... Maybe I'm paranoid but it's just how it felt. I do love the plateau area though!!"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place. For context, my ultimate favourite meal is a bagel with lox and cream cheese and I will order it without pause if it's on any menu. Montréal-style bagels are an otherworldly experience. They have a large selection of sandwiches if you are uninterested in lox but I would strongly recommend it.

My boyfriend got the Greek Bagel (which he said was decent) but trying the traditional is always a safe bet. I typically don't eat my lox and cream cheese sandwiches with tomatoes and capers but they were perfect together in this instance. I also got a latte which was so, so yummy.

We arrived around 10 am and got seated within minutes but by 10:15, there was a line out the door. The environment was pleasant, the service was incredibly fast and it was very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Came here with the family to try the infamous Montreal bagel. Now I admit, bagels are a personal fav of mine so I wasn't sure what to expect. I loved the cafe itself. Very cute with lots of tables, music and pink panther cartoons running. We ordered a bagel with peanut butter, two plain and \"the traditional\" which was smoked salmon, onion, tomato, capers, and cream cheese. The kids loved theirs as it is sweeter and more chewy. I liked the texture but did not like the sweetness. NY style bagel you still have my heart."}
{"text":"The bagels are good, but I wasn't completely blown away. But, being from New York, I guess I have different expectations of what a bagel should be. Unlike NY bagels, these bagels are thinner and naturally crunchier without being toasted. What makes St-Viateur special, in my opinion, is that the bagels are made fresh right in front of you. You can visually see where your money is going. That being said, I still think $10 for a bagel with some smoked meat and mustard thrown on it is way too much. I don't think I'd be a repeat customer. Also, the space is small and very overwhelming. There's a line for if you want to be seated, a line for if you want to order to go and a line if you JUST want bagels. Proper signage would help a lot. Also, it's  cash only, which is silly if your charging so much for your sandwiches."}
{"text":"Excellent, quick service provided by very efficient staff. The food was very fresh and enjoyable. The bagels and bagel sandwiches weren't necessarily outstanding in flavor, but there was no doubt they were very fresh, as were all the ingredients on the sandwiches."}
{"text":"New York is overrated.  Chicago deep dish pizza is better.  The Empire State Building has long been surpassed as the tallest building.  The \"NY\" Jets and \"NY\" Giants don't even play in the state.  And of course, Montreal bagels are better than the ubiquitous New York bagels.

For the bagels alone, St-Viateur deserves four stars - the standard sesame and poppy seed ones are both good.  Smaller, denser, sweeter, and honeyed, these gentle bagels won't beat you up and rob you on the subway ride home.

The extra star is for letting the Obnoxious Camera-toting American Tourist take a picture behind the counter holding the wooden bagel peel next to the wood-fire oven.  Try doing that in New York City."}
{"text":"Montreal's well known bagel shop and widely considered one of the better bagel spots. Really nice ambience when you come in with the large wood fire oven going and a friendly looking team at the counter. Customers are chatting away and enjoying their meals, price is a bit higher than you'd expect for bagels but you also get soup or salad with your meal. I had the classic bagel with smoked salmon, capers, cream cheese and red onion. Really good tasting meal but found the bagels a little chewier than expected but I believe that's how they like them in Montreal lol. Also enjoyed the sweet potato soup and had a really great garlic and herb cream cheese side dish. Definitely try the herb and garlic. Usually a pretty big line and definitely drafty if you're sitting by the door. Probably better to just grab and go than to wait!"}
{"text":"We arrived early and were seated right away. Then we were promptly ignored. The waitress took orders and brought drinks for people who had arrived after us. I tried to flag someone else down and they turned towards their coworker and chatted.

The food did arrive quickly. $12.50 for lox bagel (good amount of toppings) and soup or salad. Added another bagel for $1.50. Soup not available in the mornings so if you don't want the soup or salad take off $3.00. Bottomless coffee is $2.50.

There is another location. I will go to that one instead. Or any other bagel place in Montreal."}
{"text":"I'm a New Yorker so take this for what it is worth, I'm not a fan. 
The line was cramped, the employee rushed and rude and the bagels under-salted. 
No toasting or schmearing. NYC is still tops."}
{"text":"I'm an American who studied and lived in Montreal for 5 years and will take a Montreal bagel over a NY one any day. Don't get me wrong - I love NY bagels, but there's something about Montreal-style bagels that are just amazing. Anyway, I digress. 

If you simply want to get a freshly made bagel to go, I would recommend going to any of the St. Viateur bagel factory shops instead. If you want to sit down and enjoy a delicious bagel sandwich with a side salad and maybe a cappuccino, then definitely come to this cafe instead. Do catch the attention of one of the servers first, and she/he will sit you. Make sure you have cash on hand, as this place only accepts cash now. There are a couple of banks nearby, so you can withdraw some beforehand. 

Highly recommended stop when visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"Not as good as bagels from H&H or Murray's in New York. Honestly, they just aren't.

They ARE perfectly fine and yummy with cream cheese. Make sure you get them hot and fresh from the oven and buy them from the bagel window, not the regular cafe counter. The latter charges $3.50 for a bagel with cream cheese. At the counter, a bagel is around 70 cents and you can buy a tub of cream cheese for two bucks. I made the mistake of paying the exorbitant price at the to-go cafe side--big mistake! Wish they made it more clear about the price difference :/

The bagels are small compared to NY bagels too. I bought two (one plain, one sesame). Skip the iced coffee at this place--pretty mediocre. 
I'll be trying Fairmont before I leave Montreal to compare the two!"}
{"text":"Not quite what I expected from a bagel
Store as I am visiting from the US. There are no places to sit and you basically order to go. They don't add any spreads for you so you will have to purchase them separately and do it yourself. The bagel is more dense then the bagels I get in US and it is worth a try."}
{"text":"This was way better than anything bagel in SF. I liked the subtle sweetness of the bagel as well as the texture. I ordered the Traditional with poppy seed bagel and the artichoke salad that came with the dish. The smoked salmon could have had more flavor, but overall everything put together was delicious. We came during lunch hour, so we had to wait in line. Cash only.

This was also a Pokemon Gym, so have fun battling,"}
{"text":"I love Montral bagels - not because I'm from Montreal but simply because they are so damn good. Really just two Montreal bagel shops that are relevant: 1) St. Viateur and 2) Fairmount. My preferred bagel maker has always been St Viateur.

This is the second location of the original store on St. Viateur street. Like many former Montrealer's, I always stop to get a few dozen bagels to bring back to Toronto (Toronto Bagels bite!). 

This NDG location makes my Montreal last stop purchase easier - you can quickly hop on the 20 and head to the 401 (with the car smelling like fresh bagels).

They have a nice large patio in the front of the store but it's always busy and theres a constant flow Bagel buyers throughout the day. If you get there and the bagels just came out of the oven, you must eat one immediately as this is the best they will ever taste.

You can get a dozen bagels for $7.50 (as at June 2013). They also sells cream cheese etc. for your bagel eating needs. 

Best bagels ever - a must when your in Montreal. 

Tip - there is a Starbucks one block over on Monkland to enjoy with your hot bagels.

BK"}
{"text":"Good little breakfast place. Simple menu but good. I had the smoked meat bagel, it was very good but unoriginal. My boyfriend had the bagel with marinated eggplants, goat cheese and sun dried tomatos. That one was amazing. 
The coffees were also very good. 
Service was abit slow. It took about 20 minutes to take out order. At least we got the food quickly."}
{"text":"St V has a cozy ambience, the best bagels in the business, friendly quick service and decent coffee.

This is a nice place to bring friends from out of town to experience authentic St V bagels, in a pleasant atmosphere where you can enjoy a nice light brunch.

Try to make it here early though, because it's a very popular joint, and it fills up quickly. Between this place and Beauty'a to be quite honest I prefer St V's. There's a slightly upmarket feel, and the locks and bagel are just amazing."}
{"text":"I can not believe how the manager reacted when I found the dead fly in my salad!! He said that we are doing our best, and, you know, there are flys in air and it happens!!!! And he was like why you're making it a big deal and said, \"Haven't you seen such a thing before?!!!\"
he mentioned  like 10 times that we took out that meal from your bill while we talked about Hygiene issues!!! 
Hey! money isn't always the issue!!! Please Wash the vegetables well"}
{"text":"I read that when visiting Montreal you must try the sesame bagels. Sooo as soon as I arrived to this beautiful city, trying a sesame bagel was one of the first things I did. I must say that even though I'm not a huge fan of sesame bagels, this bagel did not disappoint. It was thinner than the bagels I'm used to in the US. It reminded of a hot warm pretzel. It also was sweeter than the US bagels. I believe the bagels are dipped in honey which gives them the sweeter taste. The bagel was pretty good. 

The place is very small and the seating is limited. If ordering takeout, the process is pretty quick. Unfortunately,  I can't say the same for people trying to dine in. I would recommend getting a bagel to go.  

It's also pretty cool to see them making the bagels in front of you. You can also get the bagels fresh from the oven. My bagel was warm, crisp on the outside, and fluffy on the inside. You can order the bagel by itself, or as a sandwich. I almost forgot to mention that the chai tea was probably the best I ever had. Everything looked delicious. :-)"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Montreal this is the bagel shop I stop at. It's my favourite of all the bagel places. Not only are the staff friendly, the bagels are the best -- perfectly hard on the outside and soft on the inside. I bought a dozen mixed classics to bring home with me which were less than $10. Even the specialty bagels are less than $10 for a dozen. 

You can also sit in and eat at the tables but they are usually very packed and I don't usually dine in but when I do, the  dishes are quite tasty! 

Overall, this is a must visit when in Montreal! There are plenty of street parking and Bixi bikes around which makes it easily accessible! :)"}
{"text":"I always come here for the bagels, whenever in Montreal!

The bagels are fresh and that's what really counts. If you are undecided on a bagel, go on and try the \"Traditional\"! You cannot go wrong with that! Always amazing!

PRO TIP: If the weather is nice outside, you can grab the bagels to  go and eat em outside and enjoy the weather!"}
{"text":"Food/bagels: got the traditional bagel sandwich (basically your typical lox bagel with cream cheese, onions, and capers) and the classic (just lox and cream cheese). They both came on sesame bagels. The combo was really good! Very impressed, for some reason though found the classic to be better? Not sure why. The fruit cup that comes with the traditional is alright. We also got bagels to go: the rosemary bagel is super good but the onion/everything bagel and the raisin bagel was meh. I think they just lacked depth of flavor compared to us/ny bagels I'm used to. But the rosemary bagel was perfection. Chewy, soft, and perfect flavor. Overall pretty impressed with montreal bagels!

Place: Really nice place itself with an open front and nice seating. Service is really fast if you're dining in and there's also a take out option. We got there around 9am and it wasn't too busy but literally 5 min later it got super busy so definitely try to go earlier if possible for breakfast dine in!"}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday, very crowded, better to just get takeout and eat at the park
I got the veggie -which had a great inclusion of white/green asparagus, broccoli and all types. The problem was the sauce was either mayo or pesto, and neither were able to stand up against the bagel. It needed cream cheese. Badly. My side salad of artichoke hearts was generous.
My husband got the WOW. the sundried tomatoes gave great flavor, but there wasn't enough. The pickled eggplant didn't have much of a taste.
The traditional was great. Everything you want in smoked salmon/onion bagel. THe only thing is that the capers were only in the middle, which made the flavors very uneven.
The bagels were awesome. Especially the sesame. There were so many sesame seeds, that it made a really great texture and crunch for each bite. THe rosemary bagel was underwhelming.
The crab salad -unnecesary. Lots of imitation crab and celery. too much
The oven inside is great to watch"}
{"text":"I was never a bagel fan, but this place reminds me of why bagel is famous and loved by a lot of people. It smells heavenly, especially the plain sesame one! It was very cool to be able to see the whole thing happening at the back of the café, honey-dipped, hand rolled and wood fired, so so special! I ended up buying 2 dozens for my folks in Toronto, and they all enjoyed it! If only I can have this fresh all the time in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Bagels are one of those cultural things people hold on to no matter if bagels are good or bad people will say they are the best in MTL and they convince themselves of the awesomeness.  

I am impartial to bagels and I am not from Montreal.  I am completely objective in saying that the bagels here are good... But so are 99 per cent of other places that make bagels.

The major factor playing a role in what makes this bagel different if you can notice at all is the the fact that you can grab it straight out of oven unlike Starbucks or Tim Hortons which have to be delivered and reheated.  

In conclusion, if this is the best that bagels can be I would say it's worth a go just to say you've been there, done that but don't expect something you've never experienced before.  Especially if you have it built up in your mind that you're face is going to explode with deliciousness like I had."}
{"text":"St-Viateur was the clear winner when I decided to try both theirs and Fairmount's bagels. 

I played it safe and got a sesame bagel and the herb and garlic cream cheese with tomato slices. This is my favourite way to eat bagels.

Our server brought it all over to the table with a heaping dish of cream cheese. At first I laughed and wondered how anyone would ever manage to eat that much cream cheese in one setting... and then I ate it all.

It was delicious and chewy and perfectly toasted. I probably could have eaten about 3 more plates it was so good."}
{"text":"We were on just a short trip to Montreal but so glad we made time for breakfast here. We all agreed this would be the place we would make a point to return to for breakfast. Delicious bagels, good service and nice atmosphere. We had breakfast before heading to the top of Mont Royal. I liked the fact that they offered what I would consider unusual side dish options. I had artichoke salad with my breakfast sandwich - unexpected and delicious!"}
{"text":"There is no denying how amazing their bagels are...just wish I could the same for the staff.
We arrived and picked up a dozen bagels and cream cheese. The cashier was plenty nice but as we tried to sit down to look at our bag full o bagels an employee glared at us and said, \"You take bagels to go, so go!\"
Coming from Vancouver I wasn't surprised he wouldn't let us stay but this is very unlikely for Montreal. Maybe he was having a bad day but I was definitely taken a back. 
Nevertheless, we grabbed a seat on a bench and ripped into our fresh sesame seed bagels like they were going out style. Yum, yum, yum!"}
{"text":"There's a longstanding debate about whose bagels are better: Montreal or NYC.  Both claim the local water and home-made variations like the addition of a touch of honey in Montreal make their bagels both unique and the best. 

Being from the West Coast, I'm a poor choice to wax poetic about bagels but I've had enough to know what I enjoy.  We stopped by St-Viateur and it's considered one of Montreal's best with several locations throughout the city.  Sure enough, with a late brunch arrival, the place was packed with a line out the door.  

If you simply want to order bagels only, a short line awaits with a cashier nearby the impressive oven with lines of freshly bagels being made.  For take-out, you can bypass the line by the door but go to the same cashier that processes all dine-in customers.  For tourists, only Canadian debit is accepted so this is largely a cash only establishment.  

The interior space is compact and busy with servers expertly navigating the tight spaces, coordinating seating, and bringing all the combination bagel orders.  For larger groups (ie: 4 or more), expect longer waits as there are more tables for 2 or 3 tops.  We waited about 45 minutes but the wait for a 2 person table was as short as 15 minutes. 

The menu consists largely of bagel choices (plain, sesame, everything, rosemary and salt, raisins, etc.) with your choice of meats (ie: Traditional lox, Italian, Montreal with smoked meats) and finally a choice of multiple salads (crab, macaroni, green) or soup (chicken macaroni elbow soup). Our order:

Traditional -$12.50. Plain toasted bagel with smoked salmon, plentiful cream cheese, capers, onions and tomatoes.  Very classic.  Loved the smoked salmon and cream cheese.  The bagel was chewier and harder than I expected without much unique flavor profile likely because it was a plain bagel.  I'm a huge fan of NYC salt bagels so this was much more muted.  The chicken soup was tasty but the white chicken meat was quite dry and overcooked.  

A La Coque Deluxe - $10.50. Rosemary salt bagel toasted with omelette egg, grilled ham, lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise.  This bagel was tastier but also quite chewier and hard from being toasted. The crab salad on the side was imitation crab and while fine wasn't noteworthy. 

Overall, we were happy to stop by and try St. Viateur but thought the waits were a touch long for a rather standard bagel experience.  Might have been a better choice to order half a dozen bagels to go, dress ourselves with salmon and ham and egg, and enjoy at home.  This stop is quite popular with the tourists and the staff does a great job with the crowds.  

St. Viateur accepts Canadian debit or cash only."}
{"text":"Really great bagels. Did not disappoint. Had to wait in line, and it is cash only, but still worth it to try these classic bagels. I recomend \"The Traditional\" with smoked salmon, etc."}
{"text":"A great place for Sunday breakfast....the tip is to get there before the crowd shows up.  

Sesame bagel with smoked salmon and cream cheese may not sound creative, and it is not, but THE bagel is what makes this dish.  For anyone who's not had an authentic Montreal-style bagel, I can tell you that there is no better carb to bite into.  

Order a cappuccino or Viennese melange with your bagels, enjoy!

The cafe is located in the \"Plateau\" district of Montreal, it's fun to stroll around and on summer weekends, you can check out the street fair."}
{"text":"I do concur with the comments regarding the prices, but unlike the locals who may not frequent this place becuase of the $$$, I was a tourist looking for some yummy Montreal bagels and price was not going to be a factor.  It is however, a reason for my 3 stars as opposed to 4.

When we were seated (already a departure from your typical NYC bagel joint) I immediately noticed the plates with multiple bagel slices and fruit and wanted one of those but didn't see it on the menu.  So instead of fretting I ordered an all dressed bagel, I guess this means \"everything\" in Canada.  What came out was exactly what I wanted.  The bagel was yummy with a (not) heathy serving of full calorie cream cheese slathered all over it.  After all the hype, it was a worthwhile trip and I would gladly return upon my next trip to Montreal.

The coffee was pretty good too."}
{"text":"This place is great. They've been around a long time and know what they're doing and it shows. Super clean place, very friendly wait staff and incredibly delicious food! Plenty of seating and you can take out as well."}
{"text":"I seriously thought that Montreal bagels were going to be some overhyped thing that only existed in people's minds. I could not have been so wrong.

Once upon a time, I thought there weren't too many differences in bagels. A bagel was a bagel, and as long as it had a little cream cheese (and not too much), it was fine.

And then I had a bagel from here. Scratch that, two bagels. I watched the employees work the dough into a circle, dip it in honey water, and throw it in the oven. I watched them artistically slather cream cheese on it (unfortunately I asked for only a little and ended up wiping a lot off) and deliver it to me in a little white paper bag.

I loved the thinness of the bagel and its vague sweetness. It's 100% superior to NYC bagels and I really just can't wait to come back to Montreal for its yummy food.

I suggest grabbing some bagels from here and eating it at the top of Mount Royal. Watch out for the raccoons."}
{"text":"Had the Traditional on a sesame and it was spectacular but what was nicer was the service.  We arrived last night from the US and wanted to get the best bagel in Montreal.  I went for a morning run to St-Viateur Bagel and Cafe' with only my credit card and some American dollars.  When I ordered they said they didn't take credit cards but did take American dollars. I had some but was short and they let it ride.  I'll be running over shortly to make up the difference but I wanted to let others know of the great bagels and the spectacular service.  Thank you St-Viateur Bagel."}
{"text":"Bagels! Yum! I got here a tad on the late side, actually it was more around 11 or 12 and the place was jam packed with a line and everything. The wait wasn't too bad. It only took about 15 minutes to get a seat. The coffee was good, definitely fresh. I ordered a bagel sandwich that came with smoked salmon, cream cheese and capers. It came with a side of soup of some kind which was excellently seasoned. If I lived in the area I could see myself going here and getting a dozen bagels on a Sunday afternoon :)"}
{"text":"Good venue with a nice amount of tables and chairs to sit in.  The menu has a range of items from single bagels to a variety of bagel sandwiches with sides included in the price.  

The beverage selection includes coffee, tea, and brunch cocktails.  I ordered a vanilla latte.  The latte was delicious and the presentation was beautiful.

As far as food goes, I ordered the lox bagel sandwich, which they call the Traditional, with a side salad.  I thoroughly enjoyed my brunch and would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I know there's an ongoing debate between who makes the best bagels - Fairmount or St. Viateur? As far as I'm concerned, these guys win, hands down. 

Location: The heart of Monkland village.

Bagels: If you're not in the mood to grab breakfast here, then head straight for the back where men sporting white aprons make these awesome bagels on site. You can order, plain, sesame, poppy seed, all dressed, cinnamon & raisin etc. A dozen will run you $7.50 (the 'specialty types like cinnamon & raisin go for $9.60) and if you stop in at the right time, you'll be getting those bagels fresh out of the wood-burning oven. HELLO! The guys even cater to my OCD need for 'light' bagels and handpick them for me when prepping my dozen. Love it.

Eating: I usually go for breakfast and it's pretty decent. The portions are pretty good for the money and I've never left there feeling hungry. Of course, every plate comes with your choice of bagel - like you had to ask! they offer a great variety of eats that will satisfy everyone. If you go on a weekend, plan to go early or expect to wait for a table. It's a pretty popular breakfast place. 

Service: It's OK but I think it depends when you go. I've had great service, but I've also had mediocre service. Regardless, I'll still go just for the bagels!"}
{"text":"Yum!  Honey infused bagels- wut?!  So hearty and delicious.  Potatoes were fantastic.  Only complaint was bagel hole so big that the sandwich fixings can fall thru the middle.  So a bit messy but nonetheless delish."}
{"text":"Small place, but line out the door. Not many places to sit for such a busy place. Food was good. My friend complained to me that it was not \"real crab\" in the crab salad.... but the salad was $3 for a good portion and tasted great, so not sure what she is complaining about. Anyway, a good selection of bagel sandwiches and drinks, especially smoothies and spiked coffees!"}
{"text":"Best bagels in Montreal. Try to get here when the bagels are hot out of the oven. It's something every bagel lover needs to experience at least once."}
{"text":"Cute little place but being from NJ, I have high expectations for bagels. These did not quite live up to my liking. These bagels were on the smaller side. Just a little bigger than Lender's bagel, but had good taste. I prefer larger bagels that are hard on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside."}
{"text":"Go during the week, the weekend is REALLY loud and busy.
Waitstaff is hit or miss - some are great, some not so great.
I personally don't eat bagels but everyone says they are quite good.
Breakfast is average, prices are standard Monkland prices.
Not my favourite  but since it's pretty much the only breakfast place on Monkland, people line up to get in."}
{"text":"I am not a bagel fan, and don't usually eat bagels... But that rule goes out the window when I'm in Montréal.  After having been introduced to Montréal bagels, it is always a foodie souvenir that I bring home to family and friends.  My only dilemma is that bagels are quite bulky, and so now when I go to Montréal I have to keep tally of who I should and shouldn't tell before I end up knee high in excess baggage fees while toting home bagels... They'd probably arrest me for poaching :p

This particular location is both a sit-down and take-out shop.  The line-up was mostly for the take-out section of the shop, and with just one lonely old man manning the cash register - things got a little bit hectic.  

When one of the waitresses saw that the line-up was growing, she came over and started taking orders and bagging bagels while repeating the orders to the gentleman at the cash register to ring it up.  While I appreciate her effort and teamwork-driven attitude, this actually made things worse.  I had ordered a dozen sesame bagels and also picked up 2 tubs of the National Herring Co.'s smoked salmon cream cheese (a MUST buy!).  A Montréal bagel without the National Herring Co.'s smoked salmon cream cheese is like eating a cupcake with no icing.  I always have a habit of double-checking my shopping bags, not because I'm paranoid that everyone is out there to rip me off - but because I realize that orders are prone to human error.  Sure enough, when I looked inside my bag, there was only 1 sole bag of 6 bagels... Luckily I checked, otherwise, my mob of bagel-promised friends would be attacking me like hyenas.  

All in all, I am a big fan of the St-Viateur Bagels.  However, I think the next time I go, I will go to a take-out only location.  4 stars for the bagels themselves, 3 stars for the service..."}
{"text":"If you need more than just the best bagels in the world to take away, the St Viateur Cafe has cafe fare to fill you up and bagels cooked on site in the wood fired oven. Watching the cooking process is amazing and not to be missed. Stay true to form and get the classic sesame. I try being creative and always wish I had stuck with tradition. Although the bio multigrain looked tempting..."}
{"text":"My wife and I were going to eat brunch at Restaurant l'avenue but didn't want to stand in line for an hour (if we were lucky) so we walked down the street and happened upon this bagel cafe. It was definitely the right choice because these bagels are delicious. I am from NY and I know from bagels and these are the real deal!"}
{"text":"Their cream cheeses are very good but bagels are nothing special. After my family paid for our meal the waitress chases after me asking for more tip. I didn't know what happened but asked for more money because her tip wasn't \"enough\". I gave her extra not knowing the entire situation until learning later she was already given tip. Seriously you get what you get based on how the payee feels about your service. W-O-W!"}
{"text":"Rude cashier. Didn't take down my order correctly and then pretty much scolded me and told me, \"No, you ordered this...\" and so on. Seemed annoyed that I greeted him and ordered in English. When I said \"lox\" he corrected me and said \"salmon\" even though he obviously knew what I meant. Bagel was fine, but they only put cream cheese on one side... Wtf? I think Fairmont is better."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the staff was friendly. I got the traditional bagel sandwich with lox and cream cheese and it was very tasty! They only take cash which I feel like they should make this known before ordering, but luckily I had cash on me to pay for our meal."}
{"text":"Amazing Bagel, and cute-trendy St-Viateur Bagel and Cafe experience.

  I took the Metro stop Mount-Royal, and started walking. The neighbourhood started getting sketchy and I realized I was walking in the wrong direction. Exit Metro to the right not left and the Bagel Cafe is a few blocks down.  

  Some patrons were enjoying their breakfasts , lattes, and teas in the open windows so it's like an indoor/outdoor patio. It was very welcoming.

 The waiter told us to sit wherever we'd like and handed us a couple menus. He also asked if we wanted coffee. Everything looked soo delicious. There's a blackboard menu offering cooling drinks, and a salad bar where they have the Bagel toppings and side displayed. 
   Behind the salad bar case is the wood burning brick oven where they make the Bagels Fresh. Such a fun process to watch, the dough is formed, dipped in honey water, sprinkled with poppy, sesame seeds, or 'all-dressed' and put in the Hot pit and then flipped and removed for Fresh Eating..mmm.

 My fiancé chose a bagel Sandwich with an omelette and Ham, and chose the side of Fruit salad that came in a nice glass cup. He ate it up, and proceeded to order a sesame bagel toasted with cream cheese. It came cut in half toasted, then sliced in half (4 pieces on the plate), and a side cup of cream cheese, was more than enough for his bagel.

  I ordered the Smoked Meat Sandwich and side salad. The smoked meat was plentiful ( came with a huge shmear-knife through it) and delicious. It came with mustard and cut pickles in side cups. The Salad was fantastic! It was baby greens and had plentiful Olives, thin sliced onion, tomato, and the house dressing was the best I've had! A nice horseradish bite to it it complimented the Smoked Meat perfectly and my man had some bites and was Jealous!

Cool atmosphere here. The ceilings have than tin-tile look to it. There are flat screen tv's and I got to watch some Pink Panther cartoons- fun.  They also had Art for sale 
on the brick wall.  

 The service was good, nothing to complain about, just that you can tell they def don't overstaff here. You pay at the Cash, put your Tips back on the table.

I would come back here in a heartbeat. The food Delish and the coffee was full of refills, we left very happy. I don't see how everyone's saying this place is expensive??  It's all you can drink coffee, Stuffed Bagel sandwich , and with sides..come on!"}
{"text":"We didn't come here to dine in because the line up was so long! So we just decided to buy some bagels to go. I got half a dozen, I actually wished I got a dozen now because their bagels are that good! My favourite is the cinnamon raisin, and the all dressed! 

Love that they make it fresh daily, and it's cool to see while you're ordering!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of St. Viateur bagels since way back, but until recently had never dined in. 

So, here's the deal. The sandwiches are a bit overpriced at around $10 (especially considering the cost of an individual bagel) but if you get a bagel with a spread, it's a decent deal. I had the salmon spread with a side of avocado and an extra bagel for about $8. The spreads come with fruit, which in this case was two pieces of melon. My only complaint is that my avocado wasn't as fresh as it could have been, and one part of it was brown and inedible, but I had so much spread leftover that I wasn't overly concerned. Other than that, the food came fast and I'd eat in again.

Of course on my way out I had to grab a dozen bagels for the road. You can also buy cream cheese and smoked salmon to go, perfect for a picnic!"}
{"text":"A Montréal pour une dizaine de jours, je ne pouvais pas ne pas tester les célèbres Bagels d'icitte.
Malheureusement je n'ai pas pu tester les bagels natures, à emporter et à tartiner de beurre salé, ni le brunch. Mais ça me fait des excellentes raisons de repasser par Montréal !

Mon amie m'a vendu le St Viateur comme étant le resto historique de Bagels, avec ses bagels roulés à la main... et je n'ai pas été déçue !

Déjà le lieu est franchement sympa, avec une façade ouverte en été, comme ça on ne pâtit pas du manque de terrasse.  Une déco un peu \"usine\", avec des tableaux, et dans le fond, la bakery avec de bonnes odeurs.

Le service, au top ! A 2, on a réservé une table pour 4, et les 2 autres ont mis du temps à arriver, on ne nous a pas fait de réflexion... Un serveur très souriant, aux petits oignons, quasiment pas d'attente... bref, une crème, ce service!

Enfin, la nourriture.....
Le bagel \"traditionnel\" à base de Saumon, est un régal, autant pour les yeux que pour le ventre.
Le smoothie fruits rouge était gigantesque, même si pas fort goutu.

Et la fin.. le CARROT CAKE ! nom de Zeus, ce CARROT CAKE (oui, en majuscule, comme pour la SAINTE BRIOCHE de chez les Frangins, à Lyon). Une part phénoménale, gargantuesque, que dis-je ! TITANESQUE ! Parfait. Ces petites carottes bien rapées, ce glaçage de malade... Oui, complètement. J'assume. Je suis tombée en amour de ce gâteau."}
{"text":"So good!! But hard to park in downtown Montreal"}
{"text":"Best fresh, consumed on the premise. Since we live out of town, we stock up until our next visit."}
{"text":"so.freaking.good!

Came here for brunch and the place was packed. This place is great b/c there's plenty of seating. The bagels are good, lots of food options, good service, so-so attitude, good prices and no complaints.

It was slightly cramped in there but hey that's the price you pay when a place is good and everyone wants to eat there :)

PS: It's interesting how a large majority of these reviews are from ppl outside out montreal, lol."}
{"text":"I agree with the overall four star rating for St. Viateur bagels. The food was excellent. We got the \"all-dressed\" bagel (aka everything) with smoked salmon, tomato, cream cheese , onion lemon and capers. I read some of the reviews that compared this to NY bagels and I actually preferred Montreal bagels. You should know going in they'll be a little different. Flatter and a little less doughy, but the favors were as good if not better than ones from NY. I highly recommend the smoked salmon as well. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was that the service was slightly below average."}
{"text":"Was so happy to discover a St-Viateur on Mont-Royal upon moving to Montreal so that I don't have to go to Mile End to get my bagel fix!

I went on a busy Sunday afternoon. It took me a few minutes to figure out that you can go right up to the counter for take out - some signage would help.

I ordered the traditional smoked salmon bagel. I loved the bagel, there was plenty of cream cheese, but the smoked salmon wasn't the best I have had. The salad portion was pretty small - I would probably subtract it for the $3.00 next time.

Can't beat Montreal bagels! Will be doing a half dozen for home sometime soon."}
{"text":"Every so often during my hectic, stress filled life, I like to take a break and just relax. I stop to smell the roses ( or whatever odor is around me), listen to the birds chirp their happy song or watcha little paint dry. The St Viateur Bagel and Cafe is that kind of place. It has two cafe locations in Montreal. Simone and I choose the cafe at 1127 Mont. Royal East. Its a little out of the way ( probably a mile or so off the subway) in the \"Plateau\" European district of Montreal, but worth the walk even during those rather frost bitten winter days. At this small cafe their specialty is Jewish style bagels baked in a wood burning oven all day long. 

You can have the traditional bagels with Lox ( a gross combo of Smoked salmon, raw onion and capers with some other junk on a platter) or with some of their flavored cream cheeses. They also have lots of specialty sandwiches featuring their bagels for the lunch crowd.

After walking from the subway on a cold morning with the snow lightly falling, Simone and I walked into the cafe which features an open kitchen so you can watch the bagels being made and hand rolled all day long.  We found a seat next to the window, but away from the drafts from the door at the entrance. You seat yourself (or at least we did ) and then the waitress or waiter takes your order. If you don't know your French lingo then they are well prepared for you, as they offer both French and English versions of the menu. Simone and I both opted to start with some hot chocolate to warm ourselves up.  The hot chocolate was made fresh and not from a packet. It was rich and topped with a little whipped cream and was an excellent choice.  After sipping on the hot chocolate we ordered our bagels. It it was breakfast time, so we opted out of the sandwich options and went for the basics.  We both ordered a Multigrain Bagel ( seriously, why does my wife insist on always getting the same thing as me ?).  To keep things healthy, I ordered mine with a side of sun dried tomato cream cheese. Simone ,with her never ending sweet tooth had hers with the chocolate cream cheese.

The bagels arrived with-in about five minutes with a small side of fresh fruit on the plate. Unfortunately, the fresh fruit in these parts during the winter months tends to be pretty tasteless, and this fruit fit into that category. So onto the main course, the Bagel. Jewish Bagels are denser then your New York variety that you usually find in the supermarket, and this makes them a little less chewy and usually moister.  The Bagels at St Viateur were done to perfection.  Hand rolled with lots of seed and oats, they arrived hot with a crunchy exterior from the wood burning oven ,but dense, doughy and moist on the inside. The bagels are cut for easy dipping into the side of cream cheese that comes in a 2oz souffle cup filled past the top. The cream cheese is also super rich and super good, and although its a lot of cheese, its good enough that you will find yourself finishing it all and licking the utensil of your choice at the end to make sure you don't leave any behind.

Simone and I both finished off our entire plate and were pretty full at the end of it all. We paid the bill and rolled ourselves back out into the frozen Montreal tundra happy with our choice. St Viateur Bagel & Cafe is a nice country cafe to sit back and relax and get a good and hearty start to your day. Four Stars ****"}
{"text":"First thing that happened when we stepped in? The waitress and another worker said that we could only sit on a certain side of the cafe because the other section was reserved for her \"friends\" to watch the habs game. I'm not sure if the staff are allowed to do this, but as more diners came in, she eventually gave up telling people where they could and couldn't sit. I really wasn't too pleased about these \"special reservations\".

My friends and I ordered different variations of the 5 quarter bagel. I had a question about the desserts, and I had to get the waitress' attention twice before she noticed me. Same with my friends, who wanted to order additional items...again, what was with the service?!

So I guess the plate I ordered was pretty worth the $3.25. You get a VERY generous amount of spread. I had about 5 or 6 tablespoons of cream cheese in a little pot. Make sure you order a spread you like. The plate also came with 2 pieces of cantaloup which was a nice surprise. A nice thing to order for a snack.

I looked around at the other patrons plates; the bagel sandwich looked AMAZING and came with a side of soup or salad. Very generous portions of those.

Too bad the service was wonky..."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious. The disappointing thing was that this place doesn't take credit card so as an American I had to reach down deep into my pocketbook for the last bits of change to pay for a sandwich. I wasn't able to afford the traditional sandwich but instead got the Le Plateau sandwich with pesto. Absolute perfection. Tastes so fresh and full of flavor. My vote's for this place as best in North America!"}
{"text":"5 stars for sure!!!! 
I don`t normally like bagels but this place made me fall in love with bagels and have them every morning for over 6 months straight!!!! You can take out fresh bagels out of the oven or enjoy a good soup and bagel sandwich"}
{"text":"The service is so bad that I actually have to write a review for the first time in my life. My boyfriend and I came all the way from Toronto and after some research we discovered that this was one of the must try's in Montreal. The moment we stepped into the place, nobody came to greet us even after we roamed around the place trying to find a good spot as we thought it was a self serve place. We found a 4 seat table and decided to take it as we have some bags with us (there were 2 other 4 seaters that were occupied only by 2 people). The waiter who seemed like the boss rushed over and told us to move to the 2 seater beside it (in an unwelcoming manner). We sat down for literally a minute, he came over to take our order, and my boyfriend told him we weren't ready. He came back in three minutes and we were clearly not ready, my boyfriend ordered since he seemed very pushy and I was still deciding. He just stood there even when I told him I wasn't sure. A normal response would've been  \"Take your time\", \"I'll be right back\", or \"Let me know when you are ready\". Just to clarify, the place wasn't even busy at all. There were at least 5 empty tables. I was so rushed that I actually just picked something random. Five minutes later, my boyfriend asked which bagel I picked and I told him I didn't pick anything. We realized that the waiter didn't even ask. I came up to him and asked him which bagel he picked for us and all he said was oh just regular sesame bagel because you didn't tell me. I didn't know what to say after his response. It was the waiter's job to ask (unless the menu specified that if you didn't notify the server of your preference, it would automatically be sesame bagel). After we were done our meals, my boyfriend took out his card and placed it on the table, not knowing that we had to go up to the cashier to pay. The waiter didn't bother to let us know even though we sat right next to his station and he was just basically chatting and had definitely noticed that we were ready to pay. After 10 mins, we got up to pay (realized that we had to pay at the front) and went back to our table to put on our jackets and were ready to leave, the server never said a word to us. (WE SAT NEXT TO HIM!!!!!) Not even a goodbye. This experience was definitely one of a kind, the kind that would make you never want to return. P.s. the food was meh, the toppings seemed like the ones you could buy at a supermarket. Bagel was definitely better than Tim Hortons, but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Avec un peu de retard mais voila mon avis après une semaine ^^.

J'ai testé la St-Viateur avec deux amies pour un brunch. J'ai pris un bagel au sésame le tout façon grec. La feta était vraiment bonne, les légumes bien frais et le bagel...et bien il m'a réconcilié avec les bagels, car je n'aime pas vraiment ça à la base.

J'ai pris un Smoothie aux fruits rouges, il n'était pas mauvais mais pas excellent non plus. C'est le seul \"mauvais point\" que je peux donner.

Pour le service, rien a redire. Nous avons pu nous asseoir des que nous sommes arrivés, malgré le monde présent. Nous avons été servis très rapidement.

Donc pour un bon petit brunch pendant que vous magasiner sur Mont-royal je conseil =)"}
{"text":"Love love this place! One of the best breakfast I have ever had! The bagel is crunchy! I had the smile! So good.. Egg yolk was runnin through the bagel after the first  bite. There was this pork aspic to put it on the bagel! It's so so good! I ate it with potatoes as well!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, no complaints.  We had a tasty traditional and smoked meat bagel sandwiches.  The soup du jour was good."}
{"text":"Food - good. Drink - eh. Service- eh.

It was a nice day so we opted to sit out on the patio. It was fairly pleasant. 

I had an everything bagel with smoked salmon, onions, and pickled capers. $11 for the shebang but it was a rather big bagel! The bagel was dense and delicious. 

I had a lemon iced tea, advertised to be made in store. It was a bit too tart for me but refreshing.

The service was okay. We didn't know where to pay afterwards considering there were two counters. One for takeout bagels, one for paying and other stuff. My partner ordered a plain bagel and got another one instead. With sesame seeds. We didn't get menus so we sat there for a good 5 to 7 minutes just talking to each other. It was a bit awkward to be like, \"Hey....can we get some menus please?\""}
{"text":"I was not overly impressed with Montréal bagels. This place is popular and the food and coffee were fine, but it's not the life changing experience that everyone says it is. There are places nearby with better food and atmospheres (Les Belle Soeuers anyone?) that aren't quite as touristy. The menu was completely in English, if that helps explain the draw here."}
{"text":"First thing I must point out is that when I do a search for this place on my GPS and on Google maps, it comes up as \"1127 Av Du Mont-Royal E\" And the Yelp map is not even close to where this actually points me. I don't know if this a problem with Yelp or whatever, but just thought I should mention that.

Moving onto the place. My fiancee and I came here on a recommendation from a security guard at the US Office of Immigration, which is why I find myself in Montreal, I am happy to report they are allowing my Fiancee into the states so we can get married, yay me, but who cares about that, this is about food..

One thing that is a knock down in points is they do not take credit cards and only Debit, which is fine for interac customers however they don't take my debit card and I don't carry cash with me, so keep that in mind before you go. Secondly is the food as uttered by previous yelpers is a tad on the expensive side 10 dollars for a bagel sandwich is a bit on the high side, but I considered this morning a special occasion and didn't care. Other times however, I would have had a slight problem with it.   

Fiancee ordered the Beef soup of the day, a bagel with cream cheese and jelly and a bowl of hot chocolate. (Yes, bowl...) I decided on a Glass of milk, flavored hazelnut coffee (turned out to be alcoholic), the omlette and ham sandwich bagel and a side of crab salad. Food wait time was approximately 9 minutes from order till complete. We got the drinks first, the soup second, and the bagels last. Snapped some pictures for your enjoyment as everything we had was pretty tasty. However I had  a unbelievably difficult time eating mine due to the hardness of the bagel squishing the egg out of it causing quite a mess. The hot chocolate actually had chocolate whipping cream on top and was great on a day where it was below freezing at the time. Like I said before I got a hazelnut coffee but I was expecting it to just be flavored, not spiked. Which is odd when you take into consideration that the menu has 2 separate sections \"Flavored\" and \"Spiked\" I drank it anyway even though I didn't fully enjoy it. The crab salad had a large amount of Dill in it, and to anyone who is a fan of this herb should give it a whirl. Large chunks of crab with dill and a very light amount of either mayo or some other sauce served on a bed of lettuce. 

All in all the service was good, the servers were friendly and I would recommend giving this place a shot just so long as you don't mind a few of the items to be a bit on the spendy side."}
{"text":"Yet another recommendation from Doctor Elsie W. (LifeOnMacro: http://lifeonmacro.com/2015/12/08/travelogue-montreal-part-deux-sept-2015/). Read it. Trust me.

Food: I ordered the omelette poppy seed bagel with pesto and asparagus soup. This totally blew me away. The combination of just the right heat, a soft bagel that tastes slightly sweet (probably due to the honey?) along with a perfectly cooked omelette was the combination of a lifetime. My wife's smoked salmon bagel was also amazing. I wish I had taken the opportunity to buy an extra bagel for $1 for purchasing a set lunch, but I was simply too full at the time to jump on this deal.

Service: we were treated spectacularly. Other, more, um, \"American\" customers appeared to confuse the server by asking for things like Ketchup and hot coffee poured on ice.

Decor: think cramped tables in a relatively tiny space. However, we were seated within fifteen minutes even during the brunch rush.

There's a good reason that there was a line outside. We hope to be back someday!"}
{"text":"Vraiment a ne pas manquer a Montréal avec c'est fameux Bagel boulanger incontournable et je ne suis pas un habituer mes chaque fois que j'en mangent Humm que ces bon haha allez y ."}
{"text":"As much as it hurts to say it, it must be said, Montreal has better bagels that New York.

St Viateur's bagels shut me up. They were perfectly soft and chewy and partnered up with smoked salmon it was just killer. 

This spot is very cute and very packed. Come early or be prepared to wait. Don't worry, its worth it. Also know that if you are getting bagels to go there's a different line for that."}
{"text":"Montreal bagels are damn tasty.

Look - I'm not here to say that it's better or worse than an NYC bagel. They are just different - almost like comparing apples and oranges. NYC bagels are thick, doughy and soft while Montreal bagels are sweet, thin and crunchy. 

While I will say that I need an NYC bagel topped with cream cheese or butter, there's just something about a Montreal bagel that makes it easier to enjoy alone. But, ordering a plain Montreal bagel for your first experience would just be downright wrong. Because of that, we made sure to hit up St-Viateur's cafe location (it seemed like the regular location just had plain bagels and no bagel sandwiches).

I ordered a sesame bagel stuffed with smoked pastrami and mustard. No cheese, no other toppings. Just meat, mustard and a bagel (oh, and pickles on the side it's like they know me). This was absolute perfection. The sweet and crunchy bagel combined with the smoky and flavorful meat and spicy mustard was the weirdest yet most glorious combination of flavors. I finished my bagel in less than five minutes and had to display some serious self control to avoid ordering another.

This bagel was pricey but was undoubtedly one of the most delicious things that I've eaten in years. 5++++ stars for this spot."}
{"text":"Such a great bagel place! I have heard so much about Montreal bagels and how they are different from NYC bagels. I was very pleased and surprised with how much I loved these bagels! It definitely lives up to the hype! 

You are able to sit down and enjoy your bagel at this location. You can see where they cook their bagels also. I ordered the sesame bagel with lox and other toppings with a side salad. It was soft and chewy. I've noticed it was also a bit sweet but still so good! I wish this was much closer to me or else I would make the journey to Montreal for these bagels!!"}
{"text":"Definitely different than a New York style bagel, but I enjoyed! Picked up bagels and got a few different options, went for the regular sesame which was my favorite as it was being churned out fresh (literally they picked my bagel up off the pile that had just come out of the oven). Also got an everything bagel which was very good and the rosemary and salt, which didn't taste very fresh....probably wouldn't get again.

Very inexpensive, definitely worth the trip when in Montreal!"}
{"text":"ok. nice food but again the waitress.  our order came late, we were asked to tip her several times (this is really bothering), and no credit cards, can debits only and so an so. too many negative things in a place.. sorry I would never try this place again"}
{"text":"Hip area with a lot of local people and families.  Lots of shops and cafes too.

The cafe has patio and inside seating.  We sat first available, which was inside. 

My wife had the Traditional bagel sandwich, which has salmon, cream cheese, and onions.  It comes with a huge portion of \"salad\" which included options like artichoke hearts, chopped egg, crab, caesar, etc.

I had the western omelet, which was a large 2-egg with ham, peppers, and onions, served with potatoes.

Both meals were very \"American\" breakfast which was both good and bad, as there was nothing special about the breakfast.  the bagels are good, but just a smaller and thinner version of most bagels."}
{"text":"Ummm yahhhh, I went here for breakfast and other than the bagel everything else was lame, little or no flavor. Looked around its all old people, this is where your taste buds go to die (ok not that bad)! The service was whatever also, It was cheap!"}
{"text":"If you are visiting or reside in Montreal, this is a good alternative for fast brunch, but watch out; this place is always busy."}
{"text":"Loved the bagels. Hand rolled and baked in a brick oven. Do they sway this old brooklyn boys heart from the ones I used to enjoy in the deli's on division in brooklyn??? NAW! forget about it! But they are the best I have tasted since my brooklyn days. They are so good you can just eat them with no filling or cream cheese or anything. I am looking forward to ordering some from there and having them shipped to me and get some from brooklyn and compare. Yes folks it will be a bagel-off!"}
{"text":"The bagel itself was definitely good, but I didn't think the lox and bagel (the traditional) was anything to write home about. Maybe I just like stronger lox but the lox here seemed very mild and the flavors were not popping. The bagels I had in New York City were a lot better. My boyfriend had the Club bagel and that was just OK. He liked mine better and he doesn't even like lox. My chai lattes was delicious though."}
{"text":"Just had the best sesame bagel of my life. Unlike American bagels, these bagels are skinnier (go figure). Fresh batches are being made throughout the day, and you get to see that process in the open kitchen and pick-up area. It's pretty simple. You basically go and order whichever bagel you want. You can get the bagel hot! 

They don't have as much variety as the competitor two blocks away, but the sesame bagel I had was just phenomenal. You can buy various cream cheeses in a fridge on the side. There are no tables, but a few sacks of flour you can sit on to finish your bagel if the weather is nasty outside. 

Remember, CASH only. 

They also deliver, which is probably the best way to get these bagels. If you're visiting, you must try the sesame bagel from here. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The bagels are freshly made and the smoked salmon sandwich is pretty good. It's a bit pricey compared to other bagel places."}
{"text":"Rude service and DRY bagels


We tried to use a coupon this establishment puts out but found the (unprinted) restrictions very off putting. Turns out if was only for the most plain bagels, with NO added condiments allowed. I wanted to PAY for some butter to put on the bagel--  but that was a no go.  Either pay for the entire thing- bagel and butter-- or get a free dry plain free bagel. And then we tried to sit in the EMPTY cafe to eat these bagels and the Pepsi we bought there. No--  sorry, not allowed with the coupon. We were chased out by a rude proprietor.  

The bagels we dry and brittle as well."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and I'm in love already! We were looking for a place to brunch near Plateau Mont Royal. I must say, this was such a great idea and I really enjoyed my meal! I ordered the classic one which was the salmon bagel with pasta salad (decent price : 13$+tax). People mostly come here for breakfast and lunch! We came around 2 and there was still lots of people inside. I was pleased with the portion they give. Bagels from St-Viateur definitely taste fresh and one of the best bagels in MTL. I will come back!!"}
{"text":"What's the big deal?!  These bagels didn't have that much of a different flavor. It was also crazy expensive to sit and eat. $5 for a chai!!!???  The bagels were cold-ish and the service was ok. I wouldn't make a special trip here for bagels. Didn't see the hoopla."}
{"text":"I almost feel like I should give this place 4 stars, because it was really cool to see the  way they produce these bagels in what appeared to be a giant slim pizza oven.    I would definitely check this place out if you are in the area just to see the production of the bagels.

As for the food though, which is what its all really about, the bagel that they gave us was cold and too dense.  It wasn't terrible, but the one's we had at Fairmount were much better.      Maybe their bagels are normally better:   maybe it was just bad timing, or maybe we needed to request one fresh out of the oven....but, I've got to grade it on what we had, and given that the bagel just A-OK, I've got to go with a 3star review of this place."}
{"text":"I was happy to come here for brunch and get to sample some delicious Montreal bagels on my visit to the city! I ordered a great breakfast sandwich that had fluffly scrambled eggs, bacon, tomato and veggies. My only regret is ordering the soup as a side. The salads looked way better. The soup that day was vegetable soup and it was very mediocre."}
{"text":"Excellent bagels and coffee. Yes, the bagels are slightly sweeter then I'm used to but perfectly chewy as a bagel should be. I especially like the way the sesame seeds completely cover the entire bagel and how the poppy seeds are only on one corner as if dipped into a cup of coffee.

My only dissatisfaction with this location is the sugar and cream station for dolling up your to go coffee. It is located right by the cash register and there is barely room to take care of business. This café could learn something from 2nd Cup which has a very roomy area for fixin your coffee."}
{"text":"When we first moved to the Plateau, this place was one of the most talked about on Mont-Royal. Everyone told us to try it out, and we are so glad we did! 
We love this super cosy spot for their Bagels and Salads!!!
My favourites are the classic, sesame, sea salt and the Italian bagel. 
From the salads, I love their Chicken Caesar Salad. (As with most places in Montreal, the Chicken Caesar salad is topped with bacon. If you do not prefer that, make sure you let the server know!)
Highly recommend this spot!!"}
{"text":"I'm missing Montreal bagels already :(

We made sure to visit this location specificially because it has a cafe and we could sit and eat.  
It was nicely full on a Friday morning. The hostess/waitress sat us immediately but was a bit slow to return to take our order.

I had the veggie bagel sandwich, the husband had the lox and cream cheese sandwich. The artichoke salad that came with my sandwhich was huge! I couldn't eat it all. the sandwich it self was great. 

Seattle only has Eltana that serves Montreal style bagels... psst... St. Viateur move on in and get started!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Great staff nice to sit outdoors. Cashier very helpful to us Americans with credit cards"}
{"text":"Quand je veux des bons bagels, la question se pose pas, je vais chez St-Viateur. Mon coup de cur va pour ceux aux sésames, on déloge pas un grand classique :) Le grand fourneau à bagels est impressionnant, et en plus le monsieur au comptoir pour emporter est adorable! 

Si on décide de manger sur place, le café est ordinaire, pas mauvais mais pas excellent, et les sandwichs (fait avec des bagels on s'entend!) sont tous bien tentant! Ils font des substitution sans frais supplémentaire (dans le Végé j'ai fait changer les curs de palmier pour des tomates séchées!) et le service est étonnamment rapide malgré l'abondance de gens constante dans le café. J'aime aussi l'option mayo ou pesto pour les sandwich! Bref, staff agréable, bonne bouffe, belle ambiance, et bagels divins. Sauf défaut c'est qu'il n'y a pas de wifi! Mais ça mérite 5 étoiles quand même :)"}
{"text":"St-Viateur bagels? Awesome. St-Viateur bagels sandwiches? Even more awesome. I'm glad there's a cafe to properly indulge for Montreal's best bagels. 

Okay, first off there's nothing better than freshly baked bagels. They're warm, soft, crispy yet fluffy. They're delicious! And they typically mostly make the main three varieties in poppy seed, sesame, and plain, so I'd recommend getting a sandwich in either of those varieties; it makes a big difference. The whole wheat bagel we had for our smoked meat bagel was a tad stiff and didn't have the same softness of the fresh sesame bagel. 

The traditional (with smoked salmon and cream cheese) was my definitely my favourite of the two sandwiches I had here. Everything was so fresh and soft that I practically inhaled it. The smoked meat was really good too. I guess the value could have been more fair, $12.50 for one small bagel sandwich is definitely on the higher side.

When you're done your meal, take some of their delicious freshly baked bagels to go."}
{"text":"So good! It's been more than a month since my last visit to St. Viateur and I still dream about these bagel sandwiches and the delicious [imitation] crab salad. 

Why must you be so far, Montreal? 

Tip 1: Split the lox because one entire order of it may get a little bleh. (Between the three of us, we shared the lox and the turkey club, which was out of this world!)

Tip 2: The all-dressed bagel is the absolute best."}
{"text":"Pricy but delicious- my husband and I split the classic salmon with cream cheese, red onion, capers, and tomatoes and the smoked meat sandwiches on whatever bagel was hot- which turned out to be sesame. These definitely aren't as big or chewy as NY/NJ bagels, but they were good. 

Located about a 5 minute walk from the Metro."}
{"text":"Best Bagel Ever!!!!

Too bad you can't find these kind of bagels in the state!

The bagels in Quebec taste totally different than the ones from the state.

So damn good!"}
{"text":"This review is for the bagels only, as I have not had a meal here, yet. 

I always head to this bakery for bagels when I'm in Montreal (usually after brunch at L'Avenue Cafe).  The bagels are as fresh as it gets, and you can see them being made in front of your eyes.  Because the different flavours are made in batches, don't be surprised if they run out of a popular flavour.  If you're willing to wait another 20 minutes, it's likely you'll be getting a fresh batch when they replenish the flavours.  Cash only.  

A crucial step is they pack the bagels in paper bags so they can cool off and the moisture is not trapped. A nice touch is providing enough bagel bags for storage later!  

Worth the drive from Toronto to Montreal :)"}
{"text":"Great breakfast!  Bagels are awesome, hot and fresh.  All breakfasts come with bagels instead of your traditional toast...(if you call toast traditional I guess...)  Good portions, nice presentation and good atmosphere in Monkland Village.

Take out is also great, they have salmon and cream cheese available for take out as well so it's a one stop shop."}
{"text":"Friends were telling me about this place and how great Montreal bagels are supposed to be.  I ordered the smoked salmon and smoked meat bagels. Now I am going to say the food tasted fine.  I'd even go as far to say very enjoyable. 

Having said that, I wouldn't say this place was out of this world delicious. It was just a pretty good local breakfast spot that is reliably going to satisfy you just not blow your mind. 

Just be warned that if you wanted a place to sit in during the morning, the line to be seated was quite long."}
{"text":"Best bagel place in the neighborhood. The have a variety of yummy bagel sandwiches. The bagels are prepared on the spot in a brick oven. Fast service. If you're from toronto and are yearning for your heavenly Tim Horton's bagel, then this isn't for you."}
{"text":"Les meilleurs bagels de Montréal.
On assiste en direct à la fabrication et les objets de notre convoitise passent encore tout chauds du four à notre bouche. Un délice."}
{"text":"Order the WOW! Just do it! I came to St-Viateur twice on a multi-day business trip to Montreal. The first time I ordered the WOW! and the second time I went with the Veggie Deluxe. I'll say that if I ordered the Veggie Deluxe the first time I wouldn't have been back. It was fine, but the amount of veggies really overpowered the bagel and I would have probably preferred just to have a salad and the bagel on the side. The WOW! though, they make this amazing marinated eggplant that is unlike anything I've ever had, put on a delicious disc of goat cheese and spice it up with tomatoes and pesto. 

The bagels are legit so be careful if you order one of the sandwiches to order wisely, otherwise I'd say keep it simple, pick a schmear and be on your way."}
{"text":"Coming from the city of bagels (NYC) and comparing other place's bagels to NY's highly dense and indulgent ones are always a great experience.

I personally enjoy other city's own version of bagels more (as an everyday meal), mainly because I don't like my bagels as dense. The bagels here have a large hole which means less bagel, which I'm not complaining about since bagels are so carb heavy. Consistency wise, the outside reminded me more of a cracker which gave it a nice crunch. If you're looking for a guilty bagel, NYC will always be home to them.

My boyfriend ordered lox, and i ordered ham and cheese. ALWAYS GO FOR LOX."}
{"text":"St Viateur bagels are an iconic Montreal food and there's a good reason for that. These are possibly the World's Best Bagels and most certainly North America's Best Bagels. 
Enter the bagel shop: stoked up brick oven at the back, with a slew of guys rolling and baking fresh bagels on the spot, just for you. Bagels are slid into the long oven all lined up on a plank, turned once or twice and then pulled out, piping hot. 
It's an eat-in diner type of spot, with a little side counter if you're just there to grab a bag of fresh bagels and go. I've done both. Nothing says 'weekend' like a hot, fresh, sesame seed encrusted St Viateur bagel with a coffee for breakfast. They've got a fridge full of cream cheeses, smoked salmon and spreads next to the takeout bagel counter, too, in case you wanted to try something new. 
Pleasant staff, good vibes - definitely one of my regular stops on Mont Royal."}
{"text":"Coming from New York City, this reminded me of an old-fashioned NYC-style bagel spot - lots of bagels, no frills, no add-ons, although you can purchase cream cheese/lox/butter in family-style quantities, just like at a grocery store.  

I thought the bagels were good and served a bit warm, which I enjoyed."}
{"text":"Mon premier repas au Canada! On s'est installées en terrasse couverte et on nous a servies de grandes cartes. Il y a beaucoup de choix et c'était très difficile de se décider. 

J'ai opté pour un thé vert servi dans les mugs de la maison (avec le logo du restaurant) et un bagel sésame avec uf, bacon, pommes de terre sautées et fruits pour 9 dollars. 

Tout était très bon! Le bagel parfaitement cuit, bacon croustillant, pommes de terre yummy. C'était un petit déj impeccable! Le service était sympa, pas trop pesant. Une bonne première experience!"}
{"text":"A Jewish-Candadian bagel? The inner NY Jew in me (exterior appearances aside) recoils in horror. Us Americans (particularly New Yorkers) would like to think that we've got the best bagels on the planet, but this Montreal bagel shop proves that perhaps we aren't the Global Dominating Power of All Things Bagel. 

These aren't the bagels you'd expect coming out of an NYC deli. Not inferior, just different. Flatter, smaller, and more crusty, these are an equally \"authentic\" version of bagel that also originated from Eastern Europe, but  found home in Montreal instead of NYC. 

Extrodinary bagels. And dare I say it? As a bagel-fiend I actually prefer the St. Viateur bagel to the bloated doughier American version. What this says about my proclivities, I'm not sure.

Update: I propose a bagel-off, 80th and Broadway. Pick the time."}
{"text":"The best bagel experience I have ever had. This place beats New York bagel anytime. I tried the plain bagel one day and came back for an everything bagel another day.
My boyfriend believed that though their bagel is good, their cream cheese was okay. I disagreed because their specialty is bagels and their bagels were good enough to forget about the standard cream cheese taste.
I also enjoyed looking at the bagels being made in a brick oven in the back of the store."}
{"text":"Cash or debit cards only, no credit cards. Not great for international visitors. Fair enough, but there's not much signage about this until you get to the counter to pay, and this is a brick and mortar establishment. Most food trucks these days will take credit. 

The bagels are decent, a bit on the small side, side of fruit is a nice touch. Service is okay."}
{"text":"I always pass by their shop on my way to drop my son for his acting class. I decided one day to go for their breakfast. It was a lineup but moving fast. We had a small table I had the chance to order their smoked salmon bagels. I really loved it. Service is fast and friendly. Price is reasonable for the quality and quantity you get."}
{"text":"Loved the wood fired everything bagel! We sat on the patio with 4 kids. They were very patient and kind to us. I like that the cream cheese is on the side."}
{"text":"It's incredible to see the explosion St-Viateur is having with new locations now found around this city these last few years. This new location is pretty much what I always hoped for. You can have the excellent bagels that you can get from this franchise but now they prepare them for you on the spot so you can eat it there any way you practically want! This is a very welcomed innovation.

The bagels are made on the spot... so fresh and warm.... the old Montreal bagel style everyone should try out at least once in their lifetime. 

The menu is pretty vast considering the amount of ways you can have your bagel prepared. Specialty bagels comes with sides of either soup or salad. Many varieties are given.

I went with their BLT bagel and crab salad. Minus a mark for not having any soup available but... it was after all 8 PM. The crab salad was really good so it made up for this shortcoming. The BLT sandwich was excellent as well. I enjoyed my food!

The service was very nice and efficient. No issues there as well.

I did find the price tag to a bit higher since the sesame bagel by itself is sold for under a dollar but you get all the thrills with your bagel and you know what.... sometimes you have to splurge and go all out.

Good times."}
{"text":"When a business does not change a thing in 60 years you  know they have something going and deserve respect.  I've seen so many times places try to get fancy and change it up and ruin things forever. Not this place. This is the best Montreal bagel you will find.   The ovens are a million years old and i'm a believer that this affects the taste.  The staff is old and grumpy but I don't care.  I'm not going there to to get psychotherapy because I lack self confidence.  I'm going there to get a dozen perfect bagels.  The people that complain about staff and service at a place like this need to remove the kosher pickle from their buttocks. Its a bagel shop.  What did you expect? Cirque du Soliel? Speaking of Dills, i'm sure they have amazing kosher dills here."}
{"text":"Delicious bagels! The staff were fun and easy going. I loved the rosemary bagel...reminded me of foccacia."}
{"text":"Hmmm. I didn't really have an expectation from a packed bagel joint. I ordered the omlette and artichoke salad. I can't say it was that amazing. It was massive, and I couldn't finish the salad but for 11.50 it just fell flat. I did like the side of pesto though. I guess it just bagel sandwiches, but it didn't really wow me in any flavor or freshness department."}
{"text":"We went to St. Viateur first and loved it, but decided to wait to review until trying both bagels. From both places, we ordered 6 sesame bagels, ate one on the way home to really detect differences in textures and tastes, and brought the rest back to the AirBnB to enjoy with Liberté and gravlax. 

Fairmount wins, hands down. Both are chewy, both are easily the best bagels I've ever had, but the flavor of Fairmount bagels is way more present and unique. You can detect the slight sweetness in these bagels, whereas you can't tell it's there with St. Viateur's. Covered with shmear and gravlax, it's a tie. For just enjoying on their own (which you're supposed to be able to do with Montreal bagels!) I've gotta hand it to Fairmount. They know what they're doing just a little bit more."}
{"text":"While doing some research before our little getaway, I find that besides poutine, bagels were also a Montreal specialty. We get here for Sunday brunch and the place was packed. Waiting wasn't bad, about 15 minutes. We both order the bloody caesar, traditional and smoked meat everything bagel platter. Everything came in a timely fashion. The drinks were good, just with enough of a kick. Everything on the platter almost reminded me of home, the only thing was that the bagel was a little smaller. It was chewy, smelled great and tasted comparable to what I'm used to. I could picture myself coming here on the regular If I ever lived here."}
{"text":"Nice spot .  Friendly staff and very attentive.  Love the bagels.  Cash only though.  Can get a bit busy at peak times"}
{"text":"I always have breakfast here when I'm in town. Great bagels."}
{"text":"Can't stop thinking about those bagels.

It's true, a born and raised New Yorker can fall in love with a bagel that is not made in NY. I was truly skeptical but went for the classic sesame bagel with smoked salmon (aka lox) and cream cheese (aka - a shmear). A little onion, some capers and a sandwich that just makes you go, ahhhhhhh!!

The trick is the bagels are boiled in honey water and baked in a wood-fired oven. This gives the sweet taste and toasty like outer crust.

Can't wait to go back to Montreal for more bagels (or I just may order some from the website).

I'm not saying better than NY bagels, just that they are great on their own and very different from NY bagels."}
{"text":"While I was visiting Montreal, I came here almost every day and split half a dozen bagels with my friend. Honestly, I don't think I've ever eaten so many bagels in my entire life. Was it worth it? Absolutely.

I'm a lot more used to NYC bagels, but I think the bagels are too different to compare. I knew I wasn't going to be able to compare when I tried the all-dressed bagel, which I'm used to calling an everything bagel, from St-Viateur. I didn't like it because I felt like everything on the bagel overpowered the taste of the bagel. Montreal bagels are smaller, very lightly sweetened with honey, and a little chewier than NYC bagels. I tried almost all of the bagels with Liberte cream cheese and decided my favorite bagel there is the rosemary and sea salt bagel, with the sesame bagel as a close second. Wow! Since you see the oven popping out hundreds of bagels, you never really question the freshness of the bagels. The bagels are even better when they're still hot from the oven.

Unfortunately, I didn't have the opportunity to dine in but was very satisfied with the takeout orders. As a tourist, I think St-Viateur lives up to its hype."}
{"text":"Decided to grab a bagel to go before we walked up mount Royal. Service wasn't warm/welcoming. Additionally, he gave me and my friend \"old, cold\"bagels, even though I saw him givinf the guy ahead of us piping hot bagels that just came out of the oven. The bagels here are more 'bagel' like to us, compared to Fairmont (bagel-as in more bread and dense-like). 

All-dressed bagel: well-seasoned toppings. You'll enjoy it if you prefer stronger toppings on bagel. 

Poppy seed: just the right amount of poppy seed to complement the doughy texture. 

Still, we would have preferred warmer bagels next time."}
{"text":"When I heard that Montreal was in the business of making good bagels, I was excited to try it out and see if they could give New York a run for their money. Well they don't... not even close. The dough is sweet, texture is fine, but the taste is \"Meh\" I have had a better bagel from a grocery store. Also the topping options were just weird. I stuck to the standard lox option but my friend ordered something with eggplant on it and she basically didn't eat any of it."}
{"text":"Great service and food! Awesome casual breakfast experience. Not too crowded and cool aesthetic. Crab salad was amazing"}
{"text":"I went to the location on Avenue Mont Royal Est.  This is a great, lively place to come for lunch while in the Plateau district. 

There aren't many tables, so you may find yourself waiting for 10 to 20 minutes. Once you order food, it comes pretty fast. 

The fake crab salad is awesome. \"Salad de goberge\" in Québécois ..

A lot of Food businesses and cafes in this area pride themselves on offering St-Viateur Bagels."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It's always busy but I've never had to wait too long for a table. The food is great and the portions are perfect. Everything on the menu is good and the bagels are always fresh."}
{"text":"Cool pour manger des bagels frais ET chauds . Must montréalais dans un quartier branché et a voir"}
{"text":"I just can't get into the Montreal bagel. I've lived in NYC for almost 7 years now and I'm convinced the NYC bagel is superior. 

I've been to St Viateur and Fairmount now... the Montreal bagel is smaller and doughier than the NYC bagel. Also neither of these shops had fresh cream cheese. Your only option is the same Philadelphia cream cheese in a plastic tub that you can find anywhere. 

The bagels are cheap. It's kinda cool seeing the oven in the back."}
{"text":"I had the Chicken on Sesame Seed Bagel with side of Beef Barley Soup. I love the toasted crispy bagel with hint of sweetness and fragrant sesame. Chicken was plain so I had to spread a lot of mayo. Soup was packed with barley and veggies - hearty and delicious! I also tried a bit of Moo Moo (roast beef) and Montreal Smoked Meat - good with mustard! 

A cute little cafe, very packed, and I love how you can see them make the bagels fresh in store!"}
{"text":"Very busy place, be prepared to wait.

It is one of the goto places in Montreal and the bagels and choice of bagels is awesome.

Service is fast, efficient and bilingual :-)"}
{"text":"Great bagels that are softer almost a pretzel like texture. Service is so so."}
{"text":"The place is cute and well organised. There is a wide selection within your main selection.  You can choose the bread bagel base (like 7 different options) same goes with the salad. They are beautifully presented and are even tastier ;-) a total win win. Very nice service even though it must feel hot near the kitchen area.  
Dessert selection is also pretty nice but be aware that one bagel dish is already very filling and dessert can be too much ;-) 
Enjoy !"}
{"text":"Très bon depuis plusieurs années et chaque fois un vrai régal leurs bagel son magique humm"}
{"text":"We made an extra effort to make it over this way to get the filled bagel. 
Food - delicious (lox bagel with artichoke salad). 

Service - pretty terrible. First they used the wrong bagel for our sandwich. After reading reviews, I was determined to have it on the original sesame as everyone said its the best option. They brought it out on an all-dressed. The waiter seemed like he didn't want to be there, and told us we weren't allowed to use a larger table for the 2 of us (we had bags) despite the place being near empty.... 

The extra bagel with your sandwich doesn't make sense to be $1.50 when I can buy one off the board for 85c. Very confused. 

Disappointed that service ruined what was supposed to be \"the best bagel in Montreal\" experience for us."}
{"text":"Montreal-style bagles: not quite New York. A bit too small for my tastes. Basically, I wish I this place was Russ and Daughters. It's close, but no cigar.

I had the traditional: the lox and cream cheese and capers were all tasty, but left something a bit wanting; they were a bit plain. Side salad was decent, but the dressing was definitely the highlight, a mustard vinaigrette. Coffee was mediocre, but I didn't mind. The other sandwiches that they had looked pretty damn good so I wish I could have gone back for more.

I was honestly amazed that there wasn't a longer line on a Saturday. The wait staff is friendly and attentive, and had us eating and out the door as happy customers in no time.

Overall, I was very happy with my breakfast."}
{"text":"Definitely the best place to enjoy a bagel in Montreal! The bagels are super fresh. Great service and great atmosphere! Their lattes are just as good as the ones I had in Italy."}
{"text":"YES! YES! YES! We were deciding where to have a world famous bagel in MOntreal and I couldn't have been more pleased with our choice! There is a feud in the city for who has the best bagel and we found it! Make sure you go when you have enough time because it is worth it to sit down and order a bagel sandwich. I ordered the salmon and he ordered the italian with their homemade pesto! They were both perfection! I dare say better than NY style bagels! The cafe is great but tight and they serve alcohol #love!"}
{"text":"I ordered the traditional bagel... best smoke salmon, capers and cream cheese on a bagel I have ever had"}
{"text":"I agree with the previous Yelper that Montreal bagels are amazing, but I'm of the opinion that R.E.A.L. Bagels are even better than St-Viateur.  The food here was ok... decent breakfast, but nothing amazing."}
{"text":"What's better for breakfast then a hot montreal bagle.
I remember the first time I tried a real montreal bagle and it was life changing. Simple with butter. Cheap good and life changing."}
{"text":"Lining up to purchase was a little confusing as there's separate lines for only buying bagels or purchasing a meal/other items. After the initial confusion, my friends and I ordered bagels and a tub of cream cheese to eat in the sun. I tried the cinnamon raisin bagel and the rosemary and sea salt. Both have the perfect consistency where it's soft enough and not too dense. I particularly enjoyed the rosemary and sea salt (even more so when dipped in cream cheese). Worth the visit if you're in town."}
{"text":"I love love love Montreal bagels! Although I have no comparison to other Montreal bagel shops like Fairmount, these bagels are amazing! Hands down their bagels surpass NYC bagels. (Yes I know I can't believe I'm saying this!) Especially when the bagels are straight from the oven, they are so delicious! Bagels are super soft in the center but has a nice, slight crisp on the edges. Their bagels satisfy you without feeling full or overloaded with carbs. I didn't sit down at the cafe but instead went to the take out counter to buy a half dozen bagels.  This location is in the Plateau neighborhood which is perfect, since you can take your bagels to go and eat it at La Fontaine park. I will be so happy if and when they open a location in NYC!"}
{"text":"With a few locations in town, I personally always frequent the St. Viateur Ouest shop. It's iconically Montreal and always jam packed. Be prepared to queue up and get your bagels quickly. if you're driving, you can run back to the car with your bagels and have a bite... No place to sit which is a bit junky.

Travelling by metro (Mont-Royal) this time, this was my first visit to a St-Viateur Café. First and foremost, who doesn't love the Plateau? Such a great neighbourhood with a ton on the go. 

I don't need to sing the praises of these bagels. They are the best. SO YUMMY. The perfect amount of sweetness, density and chewiness. 

The café concept means bagel sammies, salads and coffee. The idea of picking up a dozen bagels and then sitting with a freshly made bagel is pretty awesome. My sesame bagel was perfect and piping hot with first bite. I had a piece of my friends cinnamon raisin bagel and you could smell the cinnamon. Awesome!

Any good visitor to 514 should bring these bagels back to family and friends. Do it. You'll be loved forever."}
{"text":"I'm a believer now! Montreal bagels ARE WAYYYY BETTER than NY bagels!! I came here this past Saturday morning around 11AM. My friend and I stood in line for about 10 minutes before we got a table. I ordered the mokafrappa and an omelette sandwich on a sesame seed bagel. O.M.G. my mind was blown - best bagel I've ever had!! By the time we left, the line was out the door! I highly recommend St. Viateur. *Just note, they only take cash or Canadian credit/debit cards*"}
{"text":"Maybe it was something new for me coming from the states, but I loved this place.  Very unique style of bagels.  I had the bagel w/ the smoked Salmon...mmmmm!"}
{"text":"Oh man I totally understand the argument between those from Montreal and New York on which city has the best bagels. 

   I am a sucker for bagels and the seemingly endless possibilities for toppings. I had to try the sesame bagel. I topped it with regular cream cheese, tomatoes, cucumber, and red onion. I really enjoyed my bagel and even my hubs who isn't the biggest fan of bagels loved them. 
 
   The difference between these bagels and all the other bagel shops in the city is that they are fresh from the oven. it really adds to the flavor of the bagel, it had a great crust and a delightful chewy center while still being somewhat fluffy. 
   
   If I could have managed it I would have sent some back home to enjoy at a later date. Yet I'm sure I would have ended up eating them before I even made it to the airport. I highly recommend everyone try a bagel from Montreal and judge for yourself who has a better bagel."}
{"text":"This St. Viateur Bagel location has a two-fold purpose: a) to sell their famed bagels by the bag and bulk, and b) unlike their other locations, you can actually sit down and enjoy breakfast or morning stop here, there's a menu with breakfast offerings, table service, and the location is much bigger than the rest (pretty good amount of tables as well).

We arrived on a Sunday morning around 8:00 AM and while it was pretty busy, we were seated right away. We ordered a) a Cafe Au Lait, b) tea, c) a Sesame Bagel with Cream Cheese and d) an Everything Bagel with Cheddar Cheese. Overall, a really basic but homey neighbourhood atmosphere. The bagels were fresh, warm, crispy, delicious, and I'm glad we took the time to sit down and enjoy the so-called \"best bagels in Montreal\" while taking in the environment. It was a good way to try out these bagels fresh and for the first time, instead of just going in, buying a bag, and enjoying them later. The place was full of both locals and tourists. Service was also really friendly. 

Note that street parking is free before 9:00 AM on Sundays.

For two people, with tax and tip, we paid around $21.00."}
{"text":"This is a great brunch place. Right in the heart of the Monkland village, it's a reasonably priced option that has good food and good service. I highly recommend the Pavarotti omelette, cheese, sausage and pesto......delicious combo. The bagels are made fresh on the spot. There's usually a wait but that should be expected for a weekend brunch."}
{"text":"I really like this place for brunch.  It's got a great location in the heart of the Monkland Village, a nice sized space with a big terrace in the warmer months and fresh bagels......mmmmmmm fresh bagels. It's not fancy, it's not expensive, it's not trying to impress you with new and creative menu items that you probably don't want. It's a great simple menu with just basic good food.....nice sized omelettes with a toasted bagel and fruit, amazing bagel sandwiches, good salads, etc. Try the Pavarotti omelette, 3 eggs, pesto, sausage, tomato and bocaccini cheese, YUM! The best part is the bagels are made fresh on-site and you can buy a dozen to take home after you've already stuffed your face. Service is always warm and friendly and the wait times on the weekend aren't too bad."}
{"text":"I visited the Monkland store with two ladies, age 91 and 89. The three of us were uncomfortably squeezed into a table for two, at the last table near the kitchen entrance. 

I asked to change tables to one that sat three comfortably, and was told that if we wanted another table we would have to get back into line. Not only get back into line, but go to the END of the line. 

Did I say that my two companions were 91and 89?

Food was okay, nothing great. But man, the service and attitude."}
{"text":"Great bk Resturant. Close to public transportation. $$ bagel are really fresh and the fruit bowl omg really good. We had small wait sinces the place was really pack but the wait was worth.

Hot chocolate wasn't that great, didn't  tease the chocolate. But presentation  was excellent."}
{"text":"The place was not so busy, usually there is a line, but we still came in to order something to go. 

Had the traditional bagel sandwich (smoked salmon, capers, red onions, and cream cheese on a sesame bagel) and a side salad (beans), very good and very fresh, mouthwatering bagel.

Service was great and the staff were friendly, but they had no bag for the food container, paper or plastic, they should, but not a deal breaker.

Will drop by again next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Texture and freshness-wise, I can see how many people would rave about the quality of these bagels, even hold them above New York's.  However I've got to confess, I never was big on the \"chewy style\" bagel of days gone by, preferring the harder shell, softer interior, dough-risen fluffy kind.  What's more, St-Viateur uses less salt, which was noticeable to me, although others might prefer this.  Had I had it with lox, perhaps I would not have noticed.  All in all, this is a must stop for those hitting the points of interest, culinary or otherwise, in Montreal.  It is mandatory for official bagel eaters who would compare and contrast. The service was friendly and efficient.  I would go again."}
{"text":"Had a toasted everything bagel with smoked salmon.The bagel was different from NY bagels. Much lighter.Nice side of fruit to go with it. Friendly atmosphere.Small inside so there might be a wait at busier times.They have take-out also."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with this bagel place. I come here to grab a bag a bagels and go! 
Many different bagels to choose from. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"We arrived at the shop around noon on a Sunday. Had to wait about 20 minutes in the line. 
Ordered the original bagel sandwich (salmon and creamed cheese) and bf ordered the sandwich with egg and ham. 
Super disappointed when.m the sandwich arrived cold. The bagel was hard, cold, and tough, like a piece of stone. It was nothing like a fresh bagel. 
The service was disappointing as well. 
In the end, I ordered a fresh bagel, it was very tasty like I remembered. However, it was very hard to believe that I had to ask for a fresh bagel or all you get is a piece of stone. 
I love their fresh bagels and that is the only reason that they get 3 stars. Otherwise, I would never go back to this cafe again."}
{"text":"While in Canada me and my wife visited this awesome bagel shop. I had the salmon bagel with the crab salad it was incredible. My wife had the the Italian bagel and a salad. The staff was exceptional and the place was crowded since this was a highly rated restaurant on everyone's list s a must visit if your in Montreal. They did not disappoint. They say NYC has the best bagels well they gave them a run for the title these bagels are delicious. I will definitely come back anytime I am in Montreal. I have many photos to show. This was a great experience for a bagel experience. The salmon bagel was better than I expected and the crab salad was amazing. The waitress mentioned they put honey inside the bagels I stated whatever they are doing keep doing it. Fantastic."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast's we've ever had! If you've researched this place, you know they have the best bagels in Montreal. But that's not all. They have an entire breakfast menu. It was all great. Service was great as well! Everything was great about this place. Its worth the trip."}
{"text":"People kept telling me to get a bagel in Montreal. I'm from NY, so I was intrigued. I love myself some bagel with lox. But you know what, after tasting this, I admit... I have no idea what the difference is between a Montreal bagel and a NY one. They all good. 

So I liked that this was a sit-down cafe and they served bagels with lox. And pretty good coffee. Best bagel ever though? Not sure about that..."}
{"text":"Ok, so the 5 star rating is for the bagels, as I haven't tried out the cafe (which looked cute). Of course if you have never had a Montreal bagel in your life, prepare for your life to change for the better. No more of those shiny, poopy, dried out american bagels...nope no thanks!

The cafe has its own brick oven in the back where you go to order your bagels; poppy, sesame or everything. I got 2 doz of sesame and everything and then split a warm bagel with a friend and went to heaven.

They have a refrigerator next to where you order stocked full of spreads, cheeses and butters for your lovely Montreal bagels."}
{"text":"yumm, yumm, yumm...
excellent bagels, very yummy bagel sandwiches! yumm, yumm, yumm!!
-1 star for the price. It's a little too pricy when you consider that an individual bagel costs $.80 max, and the sandwiches are $10+. Sorry! Just being objective! Good stuff tho! Very, very yummy!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal here. If I came back I would definitely try the turkey club next time, instead of the hard boiled egg sandwich, because the selection I made was a little bland. The side salad was great and the dressing was outstanding. Overall, I found it to be slightly pricey but a good treat. Staff was very nice."}
{"text":"I was skeptical after walking almost 2 miles from our hotel that we would find a bagel that would blow our minds but lo-and-behold, our minds were B-L-O-W-N from something as simple and humble as a sesame bagel straight from the oven.

Being newbies, we asked what everyone ordered and the answer was \"sesame\" and there was a pile of them coming out of the oven with just a slight hint of burn and crisp. You pick up a few single serving Philadelphia cream cheese pads from the fridge and pay less than a buck for a fresh bagel.

The warmth of the bagel combined with just the right amount of chew puts any west coast US bagel to shame. We made a mistake of ordering some raisin bagel which was from a pile that was obviously out much longer so that one was a bit harder and colder and more normal.

Both my SO and I agreed that we could've eaten a few more of those bagels each."}
{"text":"I didn't realise that the restaurant was on the left and that the line was for take out... so when I sat down after buying a bagel the waiter tried to kick me out. So I ordered a bagel because he asked if i was ordering. I just asked what size the bagels were cus I still want to eat other foods later, but he points at my bag of bagel and says what's this? Yea I get it...the question sounds silly, but did he really have to be that rude? Also the menu was in French... I don't understand French very well but I know enough to see that there's different types of bagels to choose from, yet he failed to ask me which type I want. I'm also confused with how a place in Montreal would only have French and no English menus... either he's having a really bad day and taking it out on customers or he's just very racist. With that being said though, the bagels are no doubt very fresh and crispy. I'm not huuuuuge in bagels though so with that kind of customer service I'll probably never come back here again. Two stars is for quality of the bagel but I'm deducting 3 for that nasty attitude from the waiter."}
{"text":"Me:  \"Do you mind if we just spend part of a day in Montreal eating croissants and macarons?\"
Him:  \"That's fine, but I'm going to want to eat REAL food at some point.\"

Enter:  St-Viateur!

I'm salivating right now thinking about the Rosemary & Sea Salt bagels.  When in Montreal, you are a fool to not try at least one bagel.  The only exception is if you have a gluten allergy, but it still might be worth it.*

The Rosemary & Sea Salt bagel, served with a generous cup of plain cream cheese, is something I thought only existed in the dreams of people who love cheese + carbs.  The bagel had a much more crunchy and chewy texture than lame American bagels, which are often too dense and bread-like.

The Sesame bagels are also good.  My husband ordered the Omerta, an Italian sandwich on a bagel, and that kept him full awhile as I cruised the area later sampling croissants and macarons.  The bagels with cream cheese are perfect for breakfast, but the sandwiches are definitely ideal for a substantial lunch.

The Caramel Praline coffee is as good as it sounds too.

St-Viateur sells bagels and cream cheese to-go, but like other fresh bakery items, the bagels won't last forever.  Since we were on vacation, my storage options were limited so they sat in the paper bag on a countertop.  I purchased four bagels to go (figuring breakfast for the next two mornings), and the last two were hard and difficult to slice.  We still ate them, and they tasted good, and obviously the staleness was MY fault.  

They also take orders online and will ship to your home, how awesome is that?  Seeing as they will hold up during shipping, ask them at the shop how to best store your bagels.

The service was fine.  It was very busy, so we weren't doted on, but we weren't completely ignored either.  We were able to enjoy our meal without feeling rushed.

*I'm not a doctor.  Choose wisely."}
{"text":"Je marchais sur Mont-Royal et je devais arrêter manger quelque part. C'est là que je me suis dis, tiens un bagel de chez St-Viateur! Même en pleine heure du midi, le service a été super rapide et c'était bien bon. Mon assiette était même un peu trop pleine ... et j'ai dû prendre le reste pour emporter. Définitivement une place à essayer pour le lunch."}
{"text":"My wife's family is from Canada.  Her grandfather still lives in Montreal.  My wife has fond memories of visiting her grandparents, and she constantly raves about Montreal bagels.  So, Montreal was a must on our trip to the Northeast, and finding a good place to buy bagels was a very high priority.

This St-Viateur is sort of in the suburbs of Montreal, but it was close to where we were staying so it was a good choice for us.  In addtiion to the bagel bakery, they have a nice restaurant.  We ate breakfast here two days in a row, so I have to say it has my stamp of approval.

Motreal bagels are different from just about any other bagels I have tried.  The biggest difference probably that they bake them in wood fired brick ovens.  This gives the bagels a bit crispier outside.  Also, they don't seem to be quite as doughy.  They basically come three ways - plain, poppy seed, and sesame seed.  Whatever flavor you choose, they are delicious.

Breakfast here was very good.  The coffee and tea were high quality.  The egg dishes were well prepared and tasty, but the star of every dish was the bagel.  Service was also excellent with each request addressed promptly.

We bought two dozen bagels to go for the remainder of our trip.  We should have gotten three or even four dozen because the eight of us went through the two dozen in about three days.  

For an excellent version of unique Montreal bagels, St-Viateur's is a great place to go.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is the best of the best! They've been open for around 20 years already at this location, and for good reason! Lines for brunch on the weekend are long. The bagels are delicious, and the brunch generous and sumptuous. A decadent experience indeed!"}
{"text":"Today on Saturday this afternoon I went with my friend to this place and we waited maybe 5 minutes for a table for two the tables I find a little small and it's a bit hard to sit on on the side  you have  to squeeze in from the left atmosphere is really cute and the waittresses also while they wiggle around you a million times over menu is great food is great and the bagels are amazingly delicious but I've noticed one of the waitresses told me in a way which I felt insulted meaning: are you done I can wrap it up for you if you don't wanna eat anymore   she wanted to throw me out because I was staying there too long it's sort of my personality I always enjoy chatting with my friend since I'm a large conversationalist for one hour or two I understand they had other customers that wanted to take my spot so I decided not too finish we asked for the bill I checked it in it was just 28$ which I consider as quality of food that corresponds to the price. To yelp and all current visitors that like to dine at this place please come by you won't regret it but for the waitresses they should learn a bit about ethics and manners."}
{"text":"Oh my God!! Hands down one of the best bagel places I've been to in y life. How can a New Yorker love Montreal's bagels, I don't know! 

The bagels are lightly sweetened with honey, lightly toasted, warm, and soft. Ugh, just writing this is making my mouth water. It was sooo good! Do you know that I walked about 45 mins to get to this place because I was too cheap to take the Metro? Lol I had their salmon lox bagel and it was absolutely delicious with the right amount of capers and lemon juice in the sandwich. I loved their bagels so much that I bought 5 to take back home with me to NYC. It was so good. Must go if you are in Montreal and totally different from NYC bagels. 

Great exercise and what a treat to come here. There is dining service here that is set up like a causal cafe. You can tell this is a local mom and pop shop with the ambiance and feel of the cafe. They have local art posted on their walls that is actually for sale too if you feel connected to a piece."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch when my mom was in town, and we shared the salmon bagel with artichoke salad, and we also got an extra cinnamon raisin bagel on the side. Highly recommend the classic sesame bagel with salmon and cream cheese! The bagels were fresh, so delicious and warm! You can also buy bagels to go!"}
{"text":"So I'm on a deserted island for about 3 years, with nothing but coconuts and fish to eat. All of a sudden a sealed bag of fresh Montreal Bagels washes ashore along with a broken bag of stale soggy New York bagels...I will eat the New York Bagels.

More like bread, less like bagels. These are probably the best bagels in Montreal, but there is no way in hell you can compare a Montreal bagel to a New York bagel. The bagels in NY have a lightly crisp outer shell with a chewy pullable interior, not as dense as these. They're also bigger and have a fluffy element to them. 

I won't argue with the history, the smells, the oven or the fact that hand pulled bagels are awesome, but I don't think these bagels are amazing. I'm sorry. It still shouldn't stop you from coming here at least once."}
{"text":"We just had to try to the bagels in Montreal so we came by here to do so. Overall, I much enjoyed my experience at St-Viateur than at Fairmont bakery, though probably because St-Viateur is an actual cafe where you sit down and are served whereas Fairmont is a counter where you take the bagels to go. At St-Viateur, they had cute tables to sit at. They have a great meal where you can get a bagel with cream cheese, lox, and a salad of your choice. I also very highly recommend their caffeinated beverages. I had a delicious white chocolate lattee and their espressos looked amazing."}
{"text":"After a weekend of craft beer, poutine, and foie gras hangovers, breakfast here was the right choice. 

My dining partner got the WOW! bagel sandwich which he ordered on a multigrain bagel. Spicy eggplant, sundried tomatoes, and a half inch thick slice of rich local goat cheese smothered in pesto. The side salad of artichoke hearts was acidic and delicious as well. He proclaimed it the, \"perfect pre-flight meal\" that would carry him through the day of traveling ahead. 

I went basic. An all-dressed (everything) bagel. Toasted and served with rich, yet light and whipped in texture, sundried tomato cream cheese. The chewy bagel, fresh fruit, and cup of coffee was the remedy needed to get me going this Sunday morning. 

Service was a little slow, but so was I this morning. 

I hear they deliver to the United States. I'm a fan of the smaller, wood-fired, Montréal bagel so I'll probably be placing an order for shipment sometime soon. Yum."}
{"text":"This branch of the venerable Montreal institution is a cool addition to the Mont-Royal strip. They have their own oven and two separate counters to order takeout bagels or coffee etc to hang out.  We just popped in on the early morning of our walk through the area for a sesame and a sea salt - both were on point. I am still partial to the aesthetics of the Fairmount Bagel shop a few blacks away, but respect these guys for expanding but keeping the integrity intact.

Montreal bagels are a real deal unique thing, and definitely worth checking out.  1-2 per person is quite reasonable, as they are smaller in diameter, but the wood fired crunch of the crust is really unique.  Super duper tasty.  Like many of these other reviewers, I am an expat NYer who is an unsufferable bagel snob (most of it is just round bread - curse you Einstein Bagels!!) but I really respect and appreciate this entirely different form.  If the gluten free thing was not sweeping the US right now I am sure you would see more of these guys in the south.  Till then - worth the trek!"}
{"text":"Delicious and friendly experience! We ate here multiple times during our stay in Montreal and took bagels home from the airport kiosk!"}
{"text":"i will definitely come back here again if i were to ever want bagels. these taste different from grocery store bagels for sure. i like the fact that they are made fresh in store and you dont have to buy a whole bag of them, you can mix and match. each bagel of course if priced differently. i love their all dressed bagel. i tried their cinnamon and raison bagel and it also tasted delicious. one star off because the bagels are a bit hard to me, i wish they were softer and fluffier but the fact that they are freshly made and baked in store makes up for that. they also serve breakfast as there is a seating area."}
{"text":"Can't complain.  While $11 for a roast beef sandwich and a cup of soup seemed a bit steep, I learned on this trip to Montreal that there isn't much cheaper to be found in the city, and at least the quality of the ingredients seemed on par with the price.  In any case, there are many cafes around that have both good free wifi and solid food, so St. V is commendable on that front."}
{"text":"as a new yorker its hard to say this, but the best bagels are Montreal's. we've had \"Montreal\" bagels before with the honey water in Oakland and Vancouver but it was never like this. i compare it to \"NY\" bagels or pizza in California, its good but the best and most authentic is still in NY.  it was so amazing that we came back a second time and took 15 back with us, three we ate in the plane and the dozen we froze.

what makes Montreal bagels different from its NY counterpart is the honey water and shape. texture and density of the inner dough is very similar, and like the NY bagel it can be as rewarding just on its own. 

just like my post of Schwartz deli vs. Katz deli, we just had a NY bagel and bialy the day before so it was still fresh in our mind and palate. what we came away with was, we wouldn't mind either if we had to choose just one, but a slight edge goes to Montreal."}
{"text":"Bagels are a must try item in Montreal and you will find some of the best bagels at St-Viateur Bagel.  There are six St-Viateur Bagel shops in the Montreal metro area.  Their flagship store St-Viateur Bagel Shop on 263 St-Viateur O. is opened 24 hrs.  All others operate regular business hours. Go to their website to obtain more details.  We visited the St-Viateur Bagel & Café Mont-Royal location.  There is on the street meter parking.  The process for metered parking is to park next to a parking number. (It usually is a letter and number). Then go to the Parking machine (English Language available), enter the parking number and then enter the amount of time. The machines take coins or credit cards.

The cafe offers take-out or sit-down options.  They take cash only. No credit cards.  I ordered the sesame bagel with cream cheese and lox. It was delicious! I am going to take a dozen bagels home back to New York."}
{"text":"The bagel with smoked salmon and cream cheese is delicious.  This is one of my favorite bagel shops in Montreal. St-Viateur Bagel has several locations in the Montreal area, and this is the second location I visited. The place offers take-out and dines in services. They also serve eggs and other breakfast items. There are street metered parking which makes it very easy to access by car.  They take both cash and credit card. I would come back again."}
{"text":"A neighborhood gem.  Came for post-Christmas brunch and enjoyed the bagel with salmon.  The dish came with a huge serving of a choice of salad, unfortunately chose the Greek salad that was not good.  Warning: the crab salad is not real crab, do not get it!"}
{"text":"Delicious, sit-down or take-out bagel place that has a TON of options. Came here on a late Wed morning based on Yelp reviews, was NOT disappointed!

PROS:
* delicious bagels!!! i'm a kind of person that doesn't like plain bagels, but these were made to where it was soft inside, crunchy outside, but still flavorful (had a sesame bagel)
* ambiance is really nice; open \"kitchen,\" big glass windows, mix of seating options
* GREAT deal imo - the bagel sandwiches come with soup/salad, but it's $3 cheaper if you opt out! 
* huge food AND drink menu, and great flavor pairing
* smooth af espresso
* friendly service
* cute touristy (has t shirts, mugs etc)

CONS:
* soup choice is limited as it's only soup of the day
* wasn't crowded, but could see it getting annoying on the weekends with a smaller space                        

OVERALL:

I wish I could take this bagel place home with me! A wonderful breakfast that has something for everyone."}
{"text":"So, unfortunately my lack of stars reflects the service, not the food- but only because the awful attitude we received truly made it hard to enjoy my bagel. 

Being from the US and knowing no French, we accidentally ordered bagels at the to-go counter and then wished to sit down. When we asked for plates, we got such a sigh and eye roll. We weren't trying to avoid a fee, tipping, or cheat the system. We were simply mistaken, and had we been corrected we'd have been happy to correct whatever it was that had upset this waitress so much.  Instead, we were given plates and knives with disdain and felt awkward as we tried to enjoy our bagels.

Trust me, I would have preferred my bagel toasted! Had I understood how things worked I would have done it right. I would encourage staff to be a bit more patient. We never got any explanation of how to get seated service, so we were at a loss.

Bottom line: for those who want the full bagel experience and are from out of town, don't walk up to the to-go counter by accident! However, I'll be darned if I know what you're SUPPOSED to do! Someone local might want to chime in and let those pesky tourists know! We'd love to be in the loop!"}
{"text":"Oh my smoked meat bagel sandwich!  

DELICIOUS! First stop in Montreal was for the famous Montreal bagel.. Figured hey I'm hungry why not also try another Montreal staple.. Smoked meat.. And boy do I not regret that decision. 

My boyfriend ordered the moo moo sandwich which is roast beef, I had a bite and think that the smoked meat is the way to go for sure!  The very helpful waitress suggested that we get our sandwiches with the rosemary and sea salt bagel but then came back apologetically letting us know  that they won't be ready anytime soon... she was genuinely sorry too. 

There is seating in the place and it is kind of tight.  If you don't want to deal with that there is a to go line. 

Now the question is NYC bagel or Montreal bagel... Now that's tough.. You try and pick! Because i can't!"}
{"text":"LOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE IT!!!! The bagels are amazing! I've never actually sat down and had a meal at this place but the dishes that were going out to tables as I was ordering my bagels looked delish!"}
{"text":"My number one tip is to note that this place is cash or Canadian debit only!! If you forget once you arrive there is an ATM at the end of the block to grab cash. 

Overall I had a great experience at the St-Viateur Bagel and Cafe! I ordered a coffee and smoked salmon and cream cheese on a \"full dressed\" (everything) bagel and my friend ordered ham and Swiss on a plain bagel and an apple juice. At first the cafe looks really expensive because their sandwich options are all $10-12, but then if you read further the menu notes that they all come with either soup or a salad. There are multiple salad options to choose from but only one soup. If you don't want a large meal you can forgo the soup or salad and get just the sandwich for $3 less. 

I opted to just build my own sandwich and I was impressed! The bagel was perfectly toasted and came with a heaping portion of salmon and cream cheese and a side of cantaloupe. My friend did the pressed ham and cheese and she loved it! It came warm and was almost like a bagel panini. She also really enjoyed the apple juice! 

I would recommend this location over others since this has the option for patrons to sit down. Either way, a St. Viateur bagel is a MUST when traveling to  Montreal!"}
{"text":"A New Yorker in love with Montreal bagels. Pardon moi!?! 

Yes, I am a New Yorker who is in love with Montreal bagels. I know, it is blasphemy to say such a thing. We had gone to the other location over a year ago and we had an amazing experience so of course, we had to come back! 

We were seated pretty quickly on a Saturday afternoon, surprisingly enough.  I ordered 1 sesame bagel w/ cream cheese and a cafe au lait while the hubs ordered OJ, sesame and poppy seed bagels w/ cream cheese. The server was a bit confusing and didn't seem to understand us but whatever. I ended up with 2 sesame bagels and good thing because I ate them both, hungrily. 

There is a take out counter and a counter to pay for dine-in. We got 2 more sesame bagels for the road after our meal. Oh how I miss these bagels already!!!"}
{"text":"As a long time NY bagel fan, I was anxious to see what all the hype was for Montreal bagels. Well, the hype is real and they are fantastic! They are lighter, thinner, and crispier than NY bagels; less chewy, a slgihtly sweet aftertaste, and not as many flavors. There's definitely room in the bagel stratesphere for both NY and Montreal bagels to co-exist, and St-Viateur bagels are as good as it gets."}
{"text":"There is a long line at L'Aveneue so we come here instead. It turns out a bad choice. Bad service and we are not into the food. won't come back again."}
{"text":"Great vibe for brunch/lunch. Small, packed, but lots of seating. Lots of menu choices and many bagel types and types of spread. We ordered sandwiches. Meats were well cooked, had great flavor, and were in decent portions. Soup of the day was a creme of carrot which I was skeptical of, but became more and more of a fan with every bite. Eggs served on the side were fluffy but unspiced or salted. Tea was served in a french press. Juices were fresh and hand squeezed. Overall upbeat trendy place to eat at, but expect a wait and slower service during peak times. 
Would return and definitely recommend if not just for a bagel to go"}
{"text":"Friendly service and tasty bagels. They give you plenty of cream cheese for all (5) bagel quarter slices that they give you."}
{"text":"Pros: food was good but not great, fresh, good portion, clean. 

Cons: cash only, coffee was mediocre."}
{"text":"Great bagel joint. We had breakfast and it was fantastic. Couldnt get enough of the everything bagel. We took several to go as well. Nice atmosphere as the restaurant was covered in dark wood trim. Friendly service."}
{"text":"My friends and I went on a bagel pilgrimage, walking the miles from our Old Montreal hotel, through the park past Mount Royal, and into the Jewish section where we found the original bagel shop. No tables there, but it was fascinating to see them making the bagel dough, cutting and rolling it into rounds, dunking the bagels in liquid, and sliding them into a brick oven on long, thin wooden palettes before dumping them with a flourish into a huge bin. The front of the store was filled with stacks of flour bags, there was a long line of customers picking up brown paper bags full of bagels to take home, and it all felt marvelously authentic. One of the workers was very kind and patient in mapping out the walk to the cafe, and off we went on the next part of our adventure.

The cafe has some charm, especially the big wooden (?) bagels hanging on the storefront looking quaintly Old World. Unfortunately, our experience inside wasn't the best. My Long Island friends ordered the Traditionnel bagels with cream cheese, smoked salmon, capers, and red onion. They weren't all that impressed, particularly not thrilled about the denseness of the bagels. (Clearly this is a matter of personal taste, but we all prefer a bagel that is tender under a chewy crust.) I had a multi-grain bagel which was very heavy and dense. My first reaction was that it would be something to feed to a horse. We did enjoy the fruit cups. Our server was perfectly nice, but when I asked for more hot water in my tea press, she came back with a coffee press. Ick. I also ended up with a fly in my water, not a big deal, but the overall cleanliness of the place was a bit lacking. Finally, the little breakfast ended up seeming rather expensive. Sadly, I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Had a great salmon bagel here. Pretty good in all aspects, service, food, flavor, decor.

Salmon + everything bagel + chive cream cheese? My go to and it is pretty great here.

Definitely not up to the hype though...let's be real. DC and NY have better bagels."}
{"text":"I loved the everything bagel. When we walked in the waitress explained the procedure for us. We talked to the cashier a little. I loved the pesto cream cheese. I wish I thought to buy half a dozen to bring back to the states."}
{"text":"Most amazing bagel I've ever had!! First time having the Montreal style bagel that has no salt and a bit of honey in the dough, which is poached in honey water then baked in a wood fire oven. The bagel is super crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside and not dry at all. I prefer the smaller size compared to NY style bagels too.  

At St-Viateur I tried a turkey bagel sandwich and a bagel with just smoked salmon spread and the smoked salmon one was definitely the winner by far. I think I could use that spread on any bread and make it taste good and it was truly heavenly paired with the toasted sesame bagel. The turkey bagel sandwich was good but probably would tasted much better if the turkey and cheese were warm and melted.

Overall, I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Montreal!"}
{"text":"Okay, these are not the world's best, NYC-killing bagels. That said, they are damn fine bagels that would stomp on most of the rest of the continent. Served well, fast and friendly, all the sides and toppings were quality as well. Except the jam. Does nobody in this city make their own jam? Anyway, as noted in other reviews the eggs are that kinda egg mixture microwave stuff so if you're not into McD's style eggs, stay away but the bagels are killer and the place is cool."}
{"text":"Great bagel spot in the neighbourhood, excellent for breakfast and lunch. My favourite time to go is for brunch, it can get a little crowded but totally worth it. The service is good, the portions are generous and you have a lot options to choose from. Hard to beat!"}
{"text":"Visiting Montreal for the weekend, this place had a lot of hype.  The service was very nice, but the bagel was a typical bagel to me.  They are cash only!"}
{"text":"highly recommend the sesame bagel and the rosemary sea salt bagel.  we ordered the traditional bagel sandwich (lox capers cream cheese onions and lemon on the side) with a side of bagel. it's so funny you can order a side of bagel. but it's definitely cheaper to just buy a bagel at the front instead of ordering a \"side\" of bagel. it's nice you subtract 3 dollars if you don't order the soup/salad with the sandwich."}
{"text":"The bagels here are very yummy. Good idea to come check out in a lazy Sunday morning"}
{"text":"Encore une institution décevante...
Tout comme Schwartz et Bagel etc, le service du restaurant n'est pas très bon et ils ne prennent pas la carte de crédit. Ces adresses surf sur leur popularité, ce sont pour moi des attrape touristes.
Les bagels sont bons mais l'accompagnement est de piètre qualité. Les pâtes de ma salade de pâtes étaient sèches...
Les prix sont correct."}
{"text":"Came here today for brunch with my boyfriend - it was a first time for both of us. 

First off, I didn't find it terribly clean or inviting. There was a long line for take-away service, but not too many people waiting to be seated. 

The woman who seated us was very pleasant and communicative, but service was pretty underwhelming. The food was fine, I ordered the Le Traditionnel and it was OK, nothing great, nothing terrible. Basic bagel with cream cheese, smoked salmon, capers, and red onion. My boyfriend ordered the Meuh Meuh and it was pretty good. A very substantial amount of well-seasoned roast beef. 

I'm a New York transplant, so I'm probably biased, but this place does not impress or excite me. It all fell very flat for me - for such \"famous\" bagels, I expected a little more fanfare, but was met with a sort of wishy washy experience in a dingy spot."}
{"text":"I didn't have the pleasure of eating a full meal here, but we did stop in this famous location while in the area. We had already eaten recently so we only got a bagel to share. First off, I'm not sure if we just really small bagels in Florida, but they had the biggest bagel I've ever seen. It was scrumptious and basically melted in your mouth because it was so fresh. I loved being able to see how they bake all the bagels in bulk in their huge oven. Their process is on point. They have a nice outdoor seating area as well as a cozy indoor section. It only seats maybe 40-50 people so come early!

Would definitely love to come back here to try a breakfast sandwich next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Meilleur bagel EVER! Service rapide, bagel sortie du fourre toi le dans Yeule et apprécie!"}
{"text":"Cute little place for breakfast/lunch! We came for breakfast on a Tuesday morning and there were still a good amount of people in there. I imagine the place is packed on the weekends, so plan accordingly. We got a table by the window/front of the store, so it was nice to basically be sitting outside and enjoy our food.

- Smoked meat sandwich on a sesame bagel: Tasty, but the mustard could be better.
- Sesame bagel with sun dried tomato cream cheese and fresh tomatoes: Could really taste the freshness of the bagel since I didnt get a massive sandwich, but the bagel is a little skimpy- I was tempted to order another bagel because although I was full enough, I wasnt completely satisfied.
- Chai tea latte: a little too milky for my taste, as the chai flavor wasnt strong enough
- Regular brewed coffee: Not too strong, not too weak. We like our coffee REALLY strong, which their is not, but also not watered down or weak. 

Good place to go and enjoy a relaxing breakfast. Good service, decent food. But definitely not waiting in a long line for."}
{"text":"Came here in July for our trip to Montreal.  Fell in love with Montreal bagels.  Ordered a bagel with smoked salmon and cream cheese and capers for takeout as there was no available seating.  It was very good.  Expensive, about $10."}
{"text":"Came twice during a long weekend in the city, once to grab bagels to go and once for sandwiches to stay. You can't go wrong either way.

Cute date idea #1: Grab some bagels & cream cheese to go from the counter on the right. Walk to Parc La Fontaine, snag the picnic table of your choice and go to town. Recommended: buy fresh fruit from a nearby market to add to the spread.

Cute date idea #2: Brave the line on the left and order the Traditional to stay. I'm not even a huge fan of smoked salmon but this was absolutely delicious. (The artichoke salad was also pretty tasty, albeit unexciting.) Add a spiked coffee if you're feeling boozy.

When we ordered to-go, our server handed us an extra bagel, hot and fresh out of the oven. I couldn't help biting into it as soon as we stepped outside. You should try this at least once."}
{"text":"Best bagels in town... U can ask for a plastic knife and a Philladelphia cheese spread and eat ya bagel right outside :)"}
{"text":"These bagels were absolutely delicious!!! I ordered the whole wheat bagel with pesto cream cheese and the mix was so good. The bagels were extremely chewy and perfectly toasted. I could taste the dough, which I've never experienced before. Honestly a life-changing experience. Montreal bagel most definitely trump New York bagels. I wish I could go back to Montreal just to eat these bagels again."}
{"text":"Friendly service good food. I have gone for breakfast and lunch here probably about 20 times now still love the ambiance and service."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for lunch, although ironically I think their poppy seed bagel was the weakest part of my meal. I had the \"Omertà\" bagel sandwich with a cup of vegetable soup, and bagels aside, both were pretty good. The sandwich was essentially an Italian cold cut topped high with fresh meats and cheeses. The bagel only got in the way of the flavor and tasted just like plain toasted bread.

It's also a bit pricey, with most bagel sandwiches hovering around the $10 mark. The apple cinnamon cream cheese I sampled was very good, but I'm not sure it nor the sandwiches merit a return visit given the cost."}
{"text":"We came in for breakfast. There was a line that started at the entrance but we didn't end up waiting that long eventually. We ordered a sesame traditional (with salmon and cream cheese) and a sesame jaws (with tuna salad). Bagels were super yummy and toppings were good. My salmon was still a bit frozen though, or maybe it was kept in a very very cold fridge...? Bagels are definitely worth trying. Service is good."}
{"text":"Came here a little over a month ago when my friends and I were up in Montreal for an extended weekend. All of us are from NYC, so we were skeptical about trying out the main contender to NYC's renowned bagels. In the end, we all surmised that our roots held true and we were still bigger fans of our homegrown bagels, but the Montreal style bagels were still heavy contenders in their own right.

Once we arrived at the location, there was a slight queue on which he had to wait on before we could get seated. The wait was pretty short, though, and we were seated just shortly after our arrival to the restaurant. The menu was large and had many options for those that happen to have certain dietary restrictions. I chose the vege deluxe sandwich on a sesame seed bagel with a side of their bean salad. I liked my sandwich a lot and I thought the bagel was good. Slightly chewier and a lot denser than a New York style bagel. 

Alas, I wish I had tried a plain bagel with cream cheese, but I was happy with my choice. Looks like they also had a load of pastries to choose from, which I sadly did not get to try. I did, however, come back here the morning of my drive back to NYC to pick up some bagels for the road. 

This place is cash only, unless you have a Canadian debit card. I think it's worth checking out if you happen to be in Montreal and have a hankering for their style of bagels."}
{"text":"I didn't find the lox bagel here anything special and service wasn't very friendly. Pretty disappointed overall.

Next time, I would probably just drop by and get some bagels to go instead of doing a sit-down."}
{"text":"The original plan that day was to go to L'Avenue for brunch. When we saw the shockingly long line up for a Monday at noon, we walked onwards to St. Viateur. 

Food: 
1. Club bagel with turkey on rosemary bagel - The rosemary bagel was soooo good. I mean it's expected for a fresh bagel but the rosemary was an unexpected and tasty option that went well for both sandwiches. 
2. Tuna on rosemary bagel 
3. Chili on the side - Too beany for my liking but still quite flavourful 
4. Tuna salad on the side - Massive serving size for a side dish but a tasty option for salad! 

Overall a really viable option for plateau brunch or lunch anytime!"}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 4/5
This place is located on Avenue du Mont-Royal E. Paid street parking is available. Look out for the bold sign sign on top of the entrance which clearly shows that this place is a specialty bagel shop.

[SERVICE] - 2/5
The servers seemed so unhappy with their jobs. I tried so hard to be nice to them but they were not friendly at all.

[DÉCOR] - 4/5 
I liked the open-concept kitchen to show off their signature method of creating bagels. They hand-made the dough, soaked their bagels in water, and then cooked it in the wood fire oven. The seating area was intimate and reminisced the traditional bakery from over 60 years ago. 

[QUALITY] - 5/5
I applaud this place for their homemade bagels, high-quality ingredients, and fresh ingredients. 

[ORDER] - 4/5
Traditional Bagel Sandwich - $12.50: I got the rosemary and sea salt bagel, which was chewy and denser than a normal bagel. Smoked salmon was soft and fresh. Cream cheese was rich and savoury. Tomato, onion, capers, and lemon added crunch to the otherwise soft bagel. All sandwiches were accompanied with one choice of salad or soup, I chose the tuna salad and it was quite refreshing and did not have an overwhelming amount of mayonnaise. 

[OVERALL] - 4/5 
The ingredients inside the sandwich overpowered the rosemary and sea salt flavours of the bagel, but I really enjoyed the bagel as a whole. Next time, I think I will order an all dressed bagel to create a better contrast contrast with the cream cheese and salmon. Overall, I would definitely recommend the high-quality and 100% natural Traditional Bagel Sandwich!"}
{"text":"Obviously I had to give one of the highest rated bagel places in Montreal a try.

Montreal is very proud of its bagels and how they're made, and how they're different from the typical New York bagel. I'm not the world's biggest bagel fan, but I actually couldn't quite tell the difference between what I got here and what I could get at a typical New York deli.

The tuna spread I got with my bagel was excellent, however. This is a place I'd come back to if I'm ever in town again."}
{"text":"Montreal is a city full of great food! (Coming from a New Yorker by the way.) This cafe was no different. We were worried about not having the fresh bagels that you can get straight from their factory but they make the bagels right there.

Our group sat down for bagel sandwiches and soup. Their soup of the day was good-- a chicken, veggies, and pasta soup, and their bagel sandwiches were great! The bagels really make it worth visiting. Oh and I had pesto with my sandwich--a flavorful combo as I'm not a huge fan of mayonnaise. 

The seating was okay. I went with a group of 6 and most of the seating is for smaller groups but they were able to accommodate us well when other people cleared out. I thought the service was also good, despite the busy hour that we went. 

In the end, I regret not bringing a bag of bagels home with us, but at least we got to try them!"}
{"text":"First of all, there was nothing special about the all-dressed bagel I got here. I have definitely had better-tasting bagels and this one didn't seem very fresh. The coffee was also weirdly strong -- I got it in the middle of the day so perhaps it wasn't very fresh either. 

The main reason for this review is that this was the worst, rudest service I got while in Montreal. I needed extra milk for my coffee and the waitress I started to ask waved me off and kept walking. I thought it was because she didn't speak English until I saw her speaking it to another table. It turns out she's just rude. 

I also bought a mug here for my mom and saw another waitress inspecting them while deciding which one to give me. I assumed that was for my benefit but when I got back to my hotel hours later, I saw that the label had weird black marks on it. It's hard to believe this was accidental given her scrutiny of the mugs. 

Look, I live in DC. Tourists annoy me too, but they are a fact of life in a big city and I don't go out of my way to screw them over. What a terrible way to run a business!"}
{"text":"Inutile de rappeler que les bagels St-Viateur sont parmi les meilleurs (autant à Montréal qu'ailleurs!). Endroit idéal pour un lunch, que ce soit sur place ou à emporter. Les prix sont très raisonnables, surtout lorsque vous combinez un choix de bagel et 2 salades. Le service est toujours impeccable et le personnel est souriant. Attention toutefois: les cartes de crédit ne sont pas acceptées."}
{"text":"Best bagel experience ever!
My friend and I decided to try out St Viateur Bagel & Cafe. Located on Rue Mount - Royale. We took the Metro got off and turned right. Easy to spot. We sat by the open window to enjoy the fresh air and people watch. Although it was pouring rain- somehow with luck it stopped by the time we got the bagel cafe. The street market opened up and it was a steady flow. Staff were very pleasant. You could done in or take out. You could also watch as they made the bagels. Fresh dipped ok honey water then placed in wood fire oven. Melt in your mouth- dough was moist not dry at all. My friend got the Traditional and I got something different, as I had the Traditional before. Don't ever away like I did. Nothing compares to the Traditional with Sesame Seed Bagel (tasted my friend's)!!!
Mine was great but not in comparison. We didn't rush. There is on small tv but people were mostly enjoying each other's company. 
Wifi available. Bathrooms located downstairs. Almost have to watch your step as you get caught trying to read some of the art and clippings on the wall Down. Cute decor and clean. 
FYI - they don't take visa, just debit and cash :). 
Suggestion: when visiting - go once to get the cafe experience. Then on the day before you leave - stalk up and take home! You may need additional carry on bag ;)! Or - just take a other trip back to Montreal!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I literally ran for these bagels, from de Bleury and Sherbrooke through the park to the cafe on Avenue du Mt. Royal. Bought bagels and walked back to hotel. And I'd do it again for the love of sesame."}
{"text":"I was in Montréal on vacation and wanted to try Montréal's authentic bagels. St-Viateur didn't disappoint. I had a smoked salmon bagel with crab salad, which left my tummy pretty happy :)

This place get busy, mind you, so there might be a bit of wait depending on the day of the week and time of day. The service was 7/10 IMO, party because the staff got too busy with other customers.

The portions are quite generous, but I found the variety lacking. It wasn't like at my favourite breakfast place, Le Cartet, but it's ok. These guys cater to their own customer base, which appreciates Montréal-style bagels.

Bottom line: if you're craving a bagel + something for breakfast, this place is a good fit. I doubt you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"C'est un vrai régal de manger les bagels de St-Viateur, surtout quand ils sont encore tout chaud. On peut manger sur place ou emporter et préparer les bagels les soi. Un des meilleurs endroits pour les bagels et en plus, les prix sont très corrects."}
{"text":"Holy smokes. I didn't know I loved bagels this much until I came here. The place smells of an amazing aroma of fresh bread. You know that scene in Ratatouille when Emile (Remy's younger, fatter brother) experiences synesthesia for the first time with the cheese and grape pairing? I had that and I can still experience the awesome smells of the bagels.

We ordered 12 bagels - 6 sesame and 6 cinnamon and raisin. I tried speaking in French and the dude behind the counter was happy and appreciated my effort. He looked like Khal Drogo but was nice as a button after we talked about how awful my French was and how Toronto was pretty dope.

The venue where the bagels are sold is just in front of the humongous bagel machine. It was a huge machine that spewed tender and awesome goodness in the form of doughy circular deliciousness. 

You haven't had a bagel until you've had one fresh. I couldn't help eating them plain even throughout the ride home. I finally got back to Toronto and have half the amount of bagels left. By the next day, they were a little tougher but still amazingly good. Only after 3 days did they start getting tougher like the ones Dempster sells at the grocery mart. Mind you, this was 3 days opened and then it became as hard as a \"fresh\" bag from the grocery mart.

I miss their bagels already... You MUST come here if you're Montreal. MUST!"}
{"text":"Great little bagel spot! There weren't any tables available when we got there, but within about 5 minutes we had a spot to sit. Candace had a sandwich of some sort and I had an everything bagel and a sangria. All the food was great and service was pretty good as well. 

They only take Canadian debit cards, just FYI."}
{"text":"This was a nice breakfast stop for lox and bagels one morning. The bagels are made fresh by the minute and while they are different than New York bagels less chewy, smaller and a bit sweeter, they are very good. No complaints about the lox or the cream cheese other that to say that there was way to much cream cheese on the bagel, minor scraping fixed that issue. Our breakfast came with combination salad consisting of three bean salad, pasta salad and seafood crab salad, a nice touch and quite good, a fruit cup was thrown in for good measure. The over all experience was very good so why only three stars, well to be honest my favorite place for lox and bagels is Ruebens Deli downtown; maybe, just maybe they serve Fairmount Bagels, I'm not sure but it is my preference when lox and bagels is on the radar."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was good, though it took them a while to take our orders. Waiting line was considerable."}
{"text":"We just behaved like typical tourists and went to St Viateur to try their Bagel sandwiches. We are from NYC.

Okay so now thats established, I did like the bagels, especially that we could see the bagels coming straight out of the oven. The bagels were quite small in size and had the most amazing options for making a sandwich meal out of them. We got the veggie bagel sandwich option along with a side of their special mushroom soup- delish, by the way!

We also got their coffee in their special coffee mugs. Again, delicious.

I found the prices on the expensive side- $13 for a bagel and soup! 

After we had finished our meals, our server came to clear our plates and was surprised we had finished everything- well, I could've eaten a dessert as I was not quite full after the bagel and soup :-D

Well, a passable experience! Maybe will just pick-up the bagels and a sandwich out of it at home for less than $5 :)"}
{"text":"Visiting with 3 other guys we were hoping to try a bagel from a mom and pop shop but unfortunately turned down because we were American. The person greeted us with 'Canada is better' type remark , and then when I asked what kind of bagels she had she told us to get out and go next door because they serve people like you. So if you're visiting from the states I recommend faking an accent or go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that St-Viateur has my favourite bagels in the world. Not even close. Therefore, the food here is great by default. That being said, the cafe is cramped and overly busy (at least on the Sunday morning we attended). It was understaffed, and took longer than it should have to be served. Still, the waiters tried hard and the food was great. Still recommended!"}
{"text":"St Viateur Bagel & Cafe is my Bagel stop # 2.

This location is not really on my list of must visit list... but while I was strolling down Mont-Royal.. my Yelp Friend just stopped and point... and yes I know why I am here..

2 Free Bagels from the coupon book of Montreal Tourism's Sweet Deal offers which can only redeem at this location.

I ran in and show my coupon to the cashier and he just gave me 2 sesames bagels which came out right from the oven.

Free is good... Free is sweet... 

This is the biggest St Viateur location I been too, since it has a sit down area if you want to order food to eat in. 

Maybe next time..."}
{"text":"Expect to wait in line if you want to dine in there. The take out is pretty fast. The service is slow. I feel that we were ignored for a long time after seated. Even though I ordered multigrain bagel, I was given whole wheat. When I questioned that I didn't order whole wheat, they just simply say whole wheat is multigrain. If that is the case, why on the menu there're options for whole wheat and options for multigrain?! Service is totally 1 star. 

Food wise, I think it's ok. The traditional one is the most popular with cream cheese, salmon, capers, and tomatoes in the middle. The combination is pretty good. The bagel itself is better than the ones usually sold outside. But is it good enough to worth the wait and endure bad service? NO."}
{"text":"one of the best bagles in montreal. Smells so good and my favorite is seasome and poppy seed"}
{"text":"Merci to the waitress who gave us the English menus! We had a great lunch, BIG sandwiches stacked with meats and spreads and mugs of inexpensive and delicious coffee, with quick service. An excellent place to chill out during a busy day of touristing.

So travel tip: if you're an American traveler with little French, don't be afraid to ask for their English menu."}
{"text":"Can't argue with the neighborhood bagel joint. Was going to give it a generous 3 stars, but thinking back on how often I brag that this place is a mere 2 minutes from my door step, I think they deserve a full 4 stars. You'll catch me there sleepy eyed picking up some hot bagels for breakfast any day of the week

As far as their dining experience goes, I've only ever ordered their breakfast, and even today, for lunch, I had their house specialty, \"Smile\". It's a bagel with an over easy egg cooked in the hole that's served with potatoes, sausages (or bacon or ham), creton, beans, and fruit. Considering the competition on Monkland for breakfast, they're not going to win any awards, but the bottom line is it's good. 

They have a pretty wide range of options, so I'd think they could meet everyone's taste."}
{"text":"DH and I are bagel fans - my parents are from Brooklyn, DH and I lived in NYC, and even found a place in Arlington MA that imported bagel dough from H&H. So when we heard that Montreal bagels were a \"thing\" we knew we wanted to try them. We arrived for a late breakfast and were told to sit where we liked. We were handed an english menu (yes, sadly obvious from my \"pour deux\" that we needed one). Service wasn't warm, and was a bit flaky (I got a regular coffee instead of the espresso I ordered, server forgot what type of bagel I ordered and to ask DH what kind of bagel he wanted on his sandwich). But she was busy and honestly for a casual place, small issues (the regular coffee was good, much more important). Although her english seemed good (better than my french!), maybe the language barrier was the issue. We had regular OJ (pulpy, which we liked) which came in a pretty glass with orange slice garnish, cute. Coffee filtre, strong enough with good taste. I had a toasted poppy bagel with butter and jam - bagel was really good, and not too sweet to my taste. Definitely smaller than american bagels, not as chewy as NY bagels, but not puffy like Dunkies bagels (a good thing, in my book). Nice amount of poppy seeds. The butter/jam was in little plastic containers like you'd get in a diner (fine). It came garnished with a couple of small slices of cantaloupe. DH had a sesame bagel (also very good) with omelette, ham and pesto. It was really a delicious sandwich - the omelette was puffy (egg only, as far as I could tell) over several slices ham. The pesto came on the side, in a small cup (probably two to three generous tablespoons - more than enough), was delicious itself, and complemented the other ingredients. DH also had a fruit salad (more of a fruit cup, but fine, fresh). They didn't take credit cards - and we were out of Canadian cash - but kindly took American cash (and gave Canadian change) without any eye-rolling. The bagels are good - but we decided we didn't need any extras to take on the road. If you can't get decent bagels where you live, these are pretty to very good. And I certainly think this is a nice place to stop in for a sandwich. The neighborhood is interesting (used book stores and vinyl shops, clothes shops and other restaurants)."}
{"text":"Not as good as Fairmount Bagel, but got a place to sit. Nothing more than American Bagels, kind of disappointed. Slow service, long line, a bit annoying waiter. Not recommended"}
{"text":"Nous venons de déménager dans le coin, et reconnaissant le Café St Viateur de Monkland, nous sommes arrivés sur le lieu avenue Mont Royal avec espoir de retrouver les mêmes qualités (un service amical, la bonne bouffe fraîchement prépare, lieu chaleureux). 
Mais la première chose qu'on remarque en entrant c'est qu'on n'est pas de tout bienvenue. Le serveur nous a même pas accueilli, mais lorsque nous nous sommes assis, il nous a apportés avec vitesse les menus et l'eau.
Et il n'est pas retourné.
On attend.
On met nos menus sur la table et lui regarde, mais il a le dos au patrons pendant presque dix minutes.
Faim, je me lève pour lui demander gentiment si je commande à la caisse.
Sans des excuses ni même un petit sourire, le serveur me dit qu'il faut être patient.
Et on attend.
Finalement, il arrive pour prendre ma commande. Quand je demande c'est quoi la salade de jours, on me dit sans apologie qu'il n'y en a plus. Je détecte même de l'hostilité en ce moment. Qui suis-je, cet anglophone avec son accent parisien, ce crétin qui vient manger à 15h30 l'après midi? 
La bouffe était bonne, même qu'ils ont oublié le moutarde sur notre MooMoo, et le poulet sur l'autre sandwich était un peu sec... Les salades... Ça va, un peu oubliable. Mais le service est loin d'être irréprochable et il y a peu de possibilité que nous retournons."}
{"text":"I really don't understand why Fairmont Bagel gets the buzz - St-Viateur is where it's at if you want a great bagel, lots of choice in preparations (I had the Plateau - yummy), and a cup of coffee.  They have nice open air seating with the large windows facing the street.  The service was snappy and friendly, and the prices were fine.  Cup of coffee, $2.  Not bad.

Tourists - this is your place for an authentic Montreal bagel with delicious fixings!

Note - Cash or debit only."}
{"text":"Certains disent que les meilleurs bagels de la ville se trouvent à Saint-Viateur. Bien que je les aimes beaucoup, j'ai eaasyé le \"all-dressed\" ce matin, je n'ai pas encore essayé d'autre \"bageleries\" donc je ne sais pas encore si c'est la meilleure.

J'aime leur déjeuner et leurs sandwhichs, et le service est très bien. Notre serveuse pouvait même se souvenir des tous nos plans sans noter quoi que ça soit, et tout était parfait."}
{"text":"To begin my 'tourist in your own neighborhood' stint, I stopped into St. Viateur to see what all the fuss was about. 

I'll be very honest in that I'm not a bagel guru, scouring the best joints in North America for the most well rounded bagel. BUT,  I like carbs, and I don't judge on the source of my carbs, so yeah I feel I'm able to leave a review on these bagels. 

To start, I love the atmosphere of the cafe. Small & cozy, and you get a clear view of the massive ovens where the delectable bagels are made. 

I ordered the Italian bagel with a green salad & I was incredibly pleased. How can you go wrong with Italian meats on a sweet honey whole wheat bagel? The bagels automatically come crispy - but just the right amount. And they don't skimp on the toppings. Plus, with the large serving of greens you get, you don't feel as bad for stuffing your face. That's how it works. 

Next time I'm going to stick to a classic bagel and spread, though, because even though this was great, I don't feeI got the full tasting experience of the bagel itself."}
{"text":"Your bagel is dressed up to perfection. Especially when still warm right out of the oven.  Great brunch place."}
{"text":"You can't go to Montreal without making a pilgrimage to the two big bagel barons: St. Viateur & Fairmount. I took my daughter to the St. Viateur Bagel & Cafe so we could have a nice brunch together.

I ordered roast beef on a poppy bagel, the kid got a sesame bagel and cream cheese. She also ordered a French Vanilla coffee which came all dolled up with whipped cream. I had regular coffee with cream, and it was great.

I love Montreal bagels. They're not the big puffball extravaganzas we get here in Jersey. My daughter remarked \"look, they have a real hole.\"  

This was a nice morning treat before our long walk down St. Denis. If you're up in the area, it's worth stopping in. Very, very crowded. Bring cash. American debit won't work and they won't accept credit cards."}
{"text":"I hate to complain about a local place when everything food-wise was great, but I simply could not let this issue slide.

I was at the St Viateur cafe on Mont Royal this morning around 9:30am with a friend of mine visiting from out of town.

After we were done our breakfast, he went up to pay at the cash register and came back to the table with the change (it was about 9,50$ in change from 40$). He put down the tip (about 15%, which was fair given that our server only refilled our coffee once even though only 4 tables were occupied and she overfilled his cup and shrugged instead of apologizing).

Like many people, I don't like my tip sitting there looking all obvious while I am still finishing my last sips of coffee before leaving, so we put the tip money beside the plate that I had just finished eating from. 

As we were walking out of the restaurant, the waitress stopped me and said very loudly \"You know...tip is not included in the bill...\". I was taken aback. One, she said this loud enough so that my friend heard as well as the table that was directly beside where I was standing.

Tipping is actually optional, not mandatory, but that is beside the point; we did tip: 15% and had she been paying attention and not jumping to conclusions, she would have easily seen this tip sitting right there, all ready for her.

You can bet that I will never be bringing any clients, friends or anyone by this establishment again. I am not sure if this is just a jaded server or what, but her behaviour was completely unacceptable, uncalled for and downright rude."}
{"text":"Another popular bagel place in Montreal that we wanted to check out and grab some to bring back to Toronto. This place actually has seating where you find your own table and order your food. We didn't stay here for food as we had brunch prior to arriving here so we got a bunch of bagels to go. You can actually see the bagel making process at the back which is pretty cool. 

I only got one here to try and it was the rosemary with sea salt. It's good but I think I prefer all dressed."}
{"text":"Everyone told me that Montreal is famous for its smoked meat and its bagels. And that St. Viateur is *the* place to go for bagels. Well, they were right about the bagels. While it's not \"New York\" flavor, it's \"New York\" style. Slightly crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. It's not better than New York (I don't want a New Yorker to whack me), it's just different. Slightly smaller and maybe slightly sweeter.

I took the Métro to Mont Royal station and walked the few blocks over to here. Nice neighborhood that felt rather \"Greenwich Village\" in the daytime, I wouldn't worry about it.

Greeted in French, but I was able to order in English without difficulty. Free wi-fi."}
{"text":"So so SO good. 

I ordered a sesame seed bagel with salmon and cream cheese and from when I took the first bite, I knew that these bagels were something special. 

Just the perfect about of density and softness. I'm glad I don't live here or else I'd be ordering one every day."}
{"text":"Meh....I don't understand the hype of this place. We ordered the smoked meat sandwich with a fully dressed bagel and the traditional bagel sandwich which had salmon, capers, and cream cheese on a fully dressed bagel. The smoked meat bagel was just ok but the salmon bagel was not very good. Maybe the bagels by themselves would've been tastier. With all the great restaurants in Montreal, this one isn't really worth your time"}
{"text":"Un lendemain de soirée bien arrosée, les colocs et moi partons vers Monkland avec un grande envie d'un déjeuner frais, avec un petit peu de gras pour bien faire passer l'alcool qui macère encore et le foie qui fonctionne à 100 miles. Notre choix s'arrête sur les bagels. Le restaurant est chaleureux et nous accueille avec son grand four à bagels. La salle à manger est remplie, on observe, affamés, les assiettes de nos futurs voisins de table. Elles semblent bien garnies. Après avoir passé plusieurs minutes à éplucher le menu, on choisi tous un mélange de santé et de bien salé ! Les assiettes étaient excellentes, aucun d'entre nous n'a été déçus. Les breuvages par contre ne sont pas des meilleurs, les cafés sont ordinaires pour accompagner ce délicieux repas! 
Belle expérience, on y retournera! En espérant avoir une place sur la terrace la prochaine fois!"}
{"text":"Bad service, ok breakfast, bad everything bagels. Both times I have been to brunch here my bagel has been burnt - which is sad because you go for the bagel. The breakfast is nothing special, everything is over-salted. At least the price is reasonable, but there are better options in the area so why bother."}
{"text":"Best begal anywhere. I just brought my Toronto customer there and many others from all over the world who all have loved the bagels. I have brought them to china and they just love them too...

A must stop when in Montreal....."}
{"text":"-They have late hours and serve fresh bagels all day long
-They also have menu items other than bagels, such as pasta and sandwiches. 
-I had a plain bagel. It was very fresh. It was crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. 
-Prices seemed reasonable."}
{"text":"Montreal bagel is definitely the best tasting bagels I have had around the world!
The place is basically a bagel factory, hundreds of bagels are made all day and you can get a fresh bagel with topping of choice served toasted to go.  You can also grab bagels by the dozen or mix and match.
Definitely want to come and try sit-in lunch someday.

Recommended."}
{"text":"Pas mal déçu. La bouffe était correcte (le bagel était bon et la soupe \"moyenne\" était plutôt grande) mais le service n'était pas à la hauteur. L'ambiance est un peu trop froide et \"néon\" à mon goût, ce n'était pas très propre. 

Félicitations au serveur pour nous avoir apporté un couteau à beurre plutôt qu'une cuillère à soupe."}
{"text":"would give this place a 4 if it wasn't for a crappy last visit and the fact that the bagels never get to the table warm. this place only takes canadian cards or USD 20% exchange rate which pretty much sucks. the first time my boyfriend and i visited we had enough canadian cash and our waitress was lovely. we loved the food and lattes and decided to come back again before we left back to NY. the second time we had a diff waitress that did not pay attention to us (never refilled our water, didn't bring butter and gave me mayo instead of pesto since she didn't even ask me what i wanted)... we went around for the longest time trying to get change for our USD and when we did, the waitress came up to us to do CALCULATIONS for the bill when we already had it under control and had the audacity to tell us \"you have to leave more for tip\" and walks away. tf??? you're kidding me, right? we were just calculating the cost of the bill from CAD to their USD exchange rate and of course we were going to put tip on top. that just pissed us off when she didn't do anything as a waitress for us."}

I was soo disappointed.  I understand what makes Montreal bagels different and I was quite excited to try them.  The size and shape are different and I was okay with it.  But the taste?  I am not a fan.  My husband LOVES onion/everything bagels and he took one bite and spit it out.  The cinnamon raisin was the only I found to be okay, but I still threw the whole bag away; sad with the outcome of my pressing request that we seek out this bagel shop above all others to experience the best.

Maybe I was there on a bad day?  Not sure.  But I will just go back to NOT eating bagels: NY or otherwise."}
{"text":"C'est mon resto café préféré depuis des années. Les repas sont copieux très abordables. Les fins de semaines c'est toujours plein! Je recommande."}
{"text":"Tous les St-Viateur Bagel où je suis allés sont excellents. C'est une valeur sûre. Pour un bon café , une assiette végé ou avec viande oeufs lentilles ou un bon dessert un jus un smoothie. Service rapide musique pas trop forte et prix abordables."}
{"text":"I'd come to this bagel shop expecting some kind of magical Canadian bagel...not sure why my expectations were so high, but I didn't get that. Instead I ate slightly underwhelming bagels. 

I ate here three times since it was right below the apt I rented for my stay in Montreal. The bagels in this shop are fine--slightly more petite than the bagels I typically buy at ess-a-bagel in NYC. 

I ate sesame bagels all 3 times, with jam one morning, unsalted butter (wish it was salted) on another, and cream cheese/lox/capers on the other occasion. The lox player also came w a choice of salad (green, pasta, 3 bean) for around $11. I didn't need a salad at 8am, but when in Rome?

The cafe itself was cozy, coffee was caffeinated and the staff was friendly enough. If you find yourself in the Le Plateau area, swing by."}
{"text":"I really wanted to try a montreal bagel. Can't say it was anything to write home about. The service wasn't great. As soon as we came in the waitress looked like she wished we hadn't and that she should be elsewhere. We all ordered the traditional bagel, i specifically said 'just the sandwich' but she came out with a platter of fruit to go with it (in my opinion overripe, sour and unedible). The smoked salmon felt a little slimey and tasted more raw than it should've been. When the meal was done I felt 'forced' to give a tip that I wish I hadn't, with my server specifically stating that I give a 15% tip. An percentage she did not deserve at all considering the type of service she gave. Would I recommend this place? sure; for the experience of and being able to say I tried a montreal bagel but I would highly suggst just buying the bagel to go and having it at home."}
{"text":"Food was really great!! The only downside is that it's cash only. It's definitely an inconvenience, especially since I never carry cash. But overall, good bagels, good service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Je vais tenir des propos controversés pour les Montréalais, mais j'assume ma position. Les Meilleurs Bagels à Montréal Point! Ça sent les dimanche matin de mon enfance quand mon père \" achetait \" du temps de sommeil à ma mère en m'amenant chercher des bagels et du saumon fumé. Le bagel brûlant sortant du four partagé avec mon père sur le chemin du retour. Aucun bagel ne peut rivaliser avec ça!"}
{"text":"So cool watching the bagels being cooked in the giant open oven.

Ordered bagels to go, including cinn-raisin and rosemary/sea salt. Employees were super friendly and patient with our futile attempt at speaking French."}
