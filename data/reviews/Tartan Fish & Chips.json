{"text":"Love this place, had been going for a few years when I was living there.

Every time I'm in Oakville will pay this place a visit. The owners are very friendly too.

The Halibut and Chips are the best! The fish is usually fried (yummy!!) in tempura batter and is very fresh. 

I've tried all the other chippies (UK slang: Fish & Chip Shop's). This is the best Oakville has!"}
{"text":"Had fish and chips for the first time here. Food was delicious but it didn't WOW me like everyone said it would. Good experience though :)"}
{"text":"I'm no fish and chip expert but I had the halibut and it was good! The fries were excellent. Not a huge difference in taste between the $8 haddock and the $12 halibut but to each his own. I didn't like the mushy peas but I've never had mushy peas before so maybe I just don't like mushy peas. Friendly staff but I've got to say, the only thing Scottish in the Tartan is the bagpipes on the wall."}
{"text":"Totally unexpected, the fish and chips was fried well and moist.  The decor was a bit dated and fact it was run by Chinese people threw me off a bit but the food totally made up for it"}
{"text":"The staff were super-friendly (and accommodating as I kept changing my order as I saw more and more items on the menu that I wanted). They have the standard fish and chips (haddock, halibut, etc.), and then some other items, such as spring rolls (vegetarian). The fish and chips were generous portions, but I just wish it wasn't so oily and greasy. I have a compromised sense of smell/taste, so it might not be this way for everyone, but it felt like there was a film on the inside of my mouth when I was finished. Still, that's standard with fish and chips, so I wouldn't hold it against this restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the best ever had. Haddock was huge, it is a great meal for winter to ticken the blood. And it is always hotter than outside.

The decorations will get your attention. Then before finishing reading the British recipees on the wall, you get your order."}
{"text":"Great spot in Oakville for Fish and Chips! Very pricey though. highly recommend paying the extra to get the better quality fish and fries."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place while I was in Oakville. Upon entering the decor is quite dated but that doesn't speak for the quality of the food. 
I ordered the Halibut and Chips and I was very satisfied with the taste and quantity of the meal; probably safe to say it has been the best fish and chips I've had to date. They do have other offerings such as scallops, shrimps, and homemade Chicken fingers (which I plan to try next). Service is also quite good; pretty much at par with other fish and chips places I've been to. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great fish place to eat at in Oakville. 
I paid $15.05 for my meal, but there is a sign saying prices will be going up."}
{"text":"The batter is really light and not oily. The decor may be dated but it's charming. The service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious Scottish Fare. Excellent fish and chips, some of the best I've ever had. Like another reviewer, I didn't taste or see much difference between the Haddock (about $8.00) and the Halibut (about $12.00) - I'll get the Haddock from now on because it's much cheaper, and it's pretty much the same portion. You receive 2 packets of tarter sauce, and can purchase more for $.5 each, and if you love tarter sauce like me, you'll need it. 

The chips are delicious, and it's all a generous portion. It only took about 10 minutes for them to get our order to us, which was to go. You can sit in, and the space is warm and comfortable, and they make it very evident that this is supposed to be a Scottish establishment. 

I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for excellent Scottish fare. They even sell fish fingers! Now all they need is the custard to go with them."}
