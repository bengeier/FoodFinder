{"text":"I've been here a few times with my family and there's really nothing for me to \"complain\" about.... their service is on point, if not, gets better every time we eat here, the taste of the food is always consistent, and the serving you get for the price is great. I've read plenty of comments about the service..... maybe you guys should make sure your staff is consistent with the service? I'd really hate to come here one day and end up with a server who doesn't take care of us."}
{"text":"Rude waiter.. Don't you dare ask for something coz he will give you an attitude. Not worth your money"}
{"text":"I am from San Diego and this is by Far the BEST Filipino restaurant that I've been to and I found it here in Las Vegas NV.  Even my mom who is a Dietitian and a great cook keeps saying, this is soo good.  This is a GREAT place,  GREAT FOOD and so AFFORDABILE! This will be our stop every time we are in town.  We will bring the whole clan next time we are here! GREAT SERVICE from Len and the team. Thanks!"}
{"text":"The pork barbeque is delicious..the chicharon bulaklak is sooo good & crispy,,Also, great service,,it's a good place to eat with family or friends,,,,"}
{"text":"Just finished eating here for the first time and I'm impressed, I will be coming back to try the menu!  I ordered the lechon kawali, and it was good, it was prepared to what I was used to eating growing up, the Turon was also good.  The restaurant is setup very well and service is great.  I can't wait to try other things on the menu, I really want to give them 5 stars but I have to try the menu first."}
{"text":"The adobo fried rice was hard and tasteless.  I guess they used the left over rice but didn't cook it until it got softer and there were only shreds of adobo in it. I ordered 2 trays of pancit, but was given bihon."}
{"text":"First time in this restaurant as suggested by an acquaintance. Ordered crispy pata. Tasted as expected, crunchy without being over fried. Just like the large crispy pata served at Fiesta Filipina except it was about $4 cheaper.   Pinakbet was not impressive at all - too salty with betsuelas instead of sitaw plus talong ang kalabasa. There was no okra and ampalaya. Too much bagoong.   Service needs improvement. We wanted to order halo-halo but hubby needed to stand up and walk to the counter to get the server's attention.  This is also a short order restaurant not fast food or AYCE buffet so be prepared to wait for your order.   Overall, food and service were just at par. And that is being generous."}
{"text":"Great food. Reasonable prices. Great ambiance. Warm people. Good service. My hubby is white and don't like much of Filipino food but this is one of the best restaurants he would go to. The owners are very humble -warm people. I have been bringing people here from all walks of life...people in the mainstream .They are very thankful that I introduced them to D' Pinoy Joint, the best ever!!! Highly recommended!!!:)\" I just went there  at lunch today after church  .I brought my co-teacher with me. She had the best experience!:)"}
{"text":"If you are considering to try their:  chicken skin, lechong kawali, tosilog, bbq pork, bangusilog and bicol express, yes try them -- they're all *good.  The bangus was a bit smaller than i expected, the lechong kawali and chicken skin could be a little crispier.  If you like bicol express i think you're gonna love their bicol express! Out of all that i have tried their bicol express was impressive!  Almost all of the groups who were there at the same time we were there ordered bulalo so i'm assuming their bulalo is good. We're gonna try that next time we crave for Filipino food.  Having said all these if their prices were a little higher and their servings a little smaller i probably would think twice about giving them 4 stars."}
{"text":"poor customer service or no customer service at all! The restaurant is big but they don't have enough people to attend to you.. been to many filipino restaurant but  they're the worst in customer service. Maybe do a to go instead or be ready to flag your server.. food is not worth the wait.. never coming back!"}
{"text":"I have been to The D' Pinoy several times recently and every other time have had terrible service. The food is good but this is completely overshadowed by the awful servers who has served us on the last couple of visits. We chose to go there for a birthday meal - big mistake. We ordered drinks after our meal which was served 45 minutes after and waited 25 minutes while she chatted to people at the registrar, eventually we gave up and asked for the bill only to find we had been charged for our drinks that had never arrived! When there are only four tables needing served I was amazed at how little attention we were payed, I don't even think she smiled at us once. Plus the attitude when asked(VERY RUDE) Despite having said it before, I will definitely not be going here again.   Message to the Staff and Management;   \" You have a lot of bad reviews for some time now mainly on poor service are you even considering addressing this complaints or are you just going to sit ion it?\""}
{"text":"My mom is filipino, and it's odd, but whenever I go to a filipino restaurant run by older filipino ladies, I feel like they're a family friend.  After stuffing ourselves with sushi, we came here just for the Halo Halo.  It was so good, we slurped it down as if we weren't full to the brim with raw fish.  Generous helpings of ube ice cream, ube pudding, leche flan,...especially the ube pudding!  Few places i've tried bother to add the ube pudding and skimp on the flan.  But they all charge $6.   This has been the only halo halo in the U.S. that earned the $6 in my book!"}
{"text":"Good Filipino comfort food but trending with the times.  Chef Felix and his own family and his wife's side are all involved.  This is one classic owners who opened a restaurant as an extension of their own kitchen at home, no short cuts, ingredients meshed very well with the dish.  And to top it all, very reasonable enough to serve portions for a typical Pinoy appetite.  Well done, I hope you stay clean, friendly, and passionate!  More luck for longevity in this precarious business of running a Filipino restaurant."}
{"text":"Best filipino restaurant in town! Staff was sooo nice and food was sooo yummy! Im def going back!"}
{"text":"D'Pinoy Joint has to be one of the better Filipino Restaurants I've been to. I know this for a fact because I grew up on Filipino food, and I can tell what is great and what isn't so much.  First let's talk about food. The food here is pretty darn delicious. I can name a handful of dishes that make the trip to D'Pinoy Joint worth it (sisig, nilaga, bistec, sago gulaman, palabok, bikol express, and etc.).  The food is like how I would imagine my Lola (Lola=Grandma in Tagalog, the official language in the Philippines) would make it. Since she doesn't live anywhere near me, it was a great comfort food.  Second the atmosphere. The restaurant is small, cozy, and feels like you're in a distant relatives home.   Then theres always a singer on stage singing songs in tagalog, which is pretty nice. Live performance and a meal that tastes homemade is amazing.   Third the service. The waitresses and waiters are really kind, attentive, and polite. Which really is great, because in some Filipino places the servers have an 'I don't wanna serve you' tone in them.   Overall I really do like this place, a taste of home if you may."}
{"text":"If only \"no star\" is an option, it will be the perfect grade for this place. Grade for the service is way below zero. No follow up is made after the food is served. No refills for your water unless you call the server's attention which usually takes 15 minutes by the way. No Hi, Hello, nor thank you's either. Major major attitude and makes you feel that you're begging for their service. There was an instance when one on the owners CURSED and PUSHED one customer out of the restaurant. Whatever the reason maybe, this is deemed inappropriate especially in this kind of business where customer service should be prime. Definitely not coming back to this place again. It seems like they don't really value the input of customers as I have read the same issue from previous yelpers with no noticeable improvement of course. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else where the food is good and the atmosphere is friendly with the true spirit of filipino hospitality."}
{"text":"Service sucks top notch. The cooks are punks also. Food is great but they can use a little more hospitality training."}
{"text":"This place is legit Filipino restaurant! If you've been to the Philippines and you go to restaurants out there you have to flag down your server in order to get service that's how it is here. You have to ask for your bill cuz If you don't you'll be waiting for a long time! Food was delicious it reminds me of back home. I had the beef caldereta and it was fatty gelatinous just the way I like it."}
{"text":"We were at the table already they ask us if we can move to a different one coz they have a big party coming. They need to communicate more in order to have a better service."}
{"text":"I ordered half a tray of palabok worth $30 and an hour later it came out so dry, noodles was so hard, few frozen shrimps and no meat at all!! Never again I will order for an event!!! Not worth the price!!"}
{"text":"On my trip to Las Vegas I wanted to add some Filipino food into my trip and D' Pinoy Joint was recommended on yelp for good Filipino foods and this was nearby. The waitress was very kind and so were the others. I immediately  ordered the fried tilapia and a mango smoothie. My tilapia didn't take quite a long time. The tilapia was \"OK\", it wasn't amazing, but not very filling either. But the mango smoothie was great."}
{"text":"The food needs improvement ! its not really good and I'd rather eat at DT's"}
{"text":"Service sucked but food is ok...I had better, and they could've had way better service. It felt like we were not welcomed at all...what happened to the Filipino hospitality. The server (I was not able to get his name) was yawning a lot even while taking our order. It seemed like this business was family owned and this guy was just being forced to work there. With all this other good Pinoy places to go to, I don't think we'll be back here...thanks for the experience."}
{"text":"Today I wanted some Filipino  grinds.  This place  is close to home .  We get  seated right next to another table , that it was like we were joining  them for dinner . On the other side there was like 15 lady's have a birthday dinner .  So now we get our order in waiting 15 minutes.  Oh there was a booth when we got there but it was not set up still had the food from the last PPL that sat there. So now 1/2 hr pass .  The big group start to get there food . We still have not been served.  We just ordered three items.  Now 45 min pass still no food . I turn to were the booth was and there are PPL . Getting food . And we had our order in be for them . I kindly as the waiters where is our order. She said that the big group had order 1st. I did not tell her about the booth  already eating . So.i wait.5 more minutes  . Then we walked out . So sad this food is ok not the best flip.food but ok.  So sad for my tummy lol."}
{"text":"Great Filipino food!  It's like straight out of my mom's kitchen. The kare-kare, pork binagoongan, bagoong rice and okoy were perfect.  Crispy pata was good but would've been better if there were no hair visible on the trotters.  The service was fantastic. Food were served quickly and servers were accommodating."}
{"text":"It feels home to be here!  Good Filipino food...sinigang..dinuguan ..sisig.. pancit..eggroll... and a lot more. The server/staff/owner are friendly."}
{"text":"This place is great! The chicken barbecue's really yummy! Will definitely come back here..."}
{"text":"Always enjoy coming here. The lumpia and pancit are my favorites. Friendly staff and helpful if you have questions about the meals. You have to get halo halo to complete the meal."}
{"text":"Two days in a row, I decided to call in and order out. I ordered by phone was told to pick up in 20 min and given total check. To my amazement, staff I gave my order to was so knowledgeable and the process was easy as 1/2/3. I came to a packed resto but at the same time my order was promptly ready as told. At last we now have an efficient and well managed Filipino eatery for \"eat in\" or \"eat out\"! Way too good..."}
{"text":"Delicious krispy pata and ginataang gulay. Haven't tried the other items yet.  A bit expensive but overall good food."}
{"text":"Writing this review after coming to the restaurant for the 3rd time. The first 2 were sit-downs and i feel it was ok so i didnt feel like writing a review. But the 3rd time was an order/pick-up and my experience didnt go well, so thats why i am writing this.  The place looks clean. The waiters/servers are ok. But i got the feeling that if they dont know you/not familiar with them, you wont get a smile or even an eye contact.  I called ahead of time so that they can have my order for pick up by the time i arrive. I ordered Crispy Pata (which i am aware that takes time to prepare) & Pork Sisig. I arrived 30 mins later (& i told them that i will be coming 30 mins later), but my food wasnt still ready. I still waited for an extra 20 mins before i got my order.   I ate my Crispy Pata at home and it was still a bit undercooked. The Pork Sisig was super oily. I will give this place a try for one more time in the future and hoping for a better service."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at this place was amazing! It was very modern and all the decor was cool. The food was OK and the employees were nice. But my problem with this restaurant was the speed. When we ordered our food, it took them about 45 minutes. And we didn't even order a lot. You can go to a five-star restaurant along the Strip and they can deliver your food in about 15-25 minutes. I would recommend this place but you must be very patient and not that hungry. If you are hungry and impatient, this might not be the place for you."}
{"text":"I loved coming here up until today. Penny took great care of us when we would come almost weekly even when we got so some food catered for our Party.  Today was just a shady experience overall. And of course our Favorite server Penny is off. The guy who greeted us seems like he didn't want to be there prior to greeting us, he was actually outside the restaurant front door smoking. We weren't quite ready to order yet at the time  so a little later a lady took our order. We ordered Bistek and Bangus but my husband accidentally ordered the Inihaw instead of his favorite Daing (Fried Bangus) my husband doesn't speak nor understand tagalog. Food took a long time to come out and when it did we got the Bistek and Inihaw. I told the server my husband wanted the Fried Bangus instead and apologized for our mistake. The lady who took our order came from the Kitchen and started pointing and arguing about our order. I understand it was a mistake in our part and we apologize but we don't really need to argue with you over what Bangus my husband pointed at. Afterwall we are still paying customers and would appreciate a little bit of customer service and satisfaction. My husband lost his appetite over the argument told the Lady he doesn't want any more bangus, But ofcourse the food came out 5 mins later and charged us for for Inihaw instead of Daing. I told another lady that the bill was incorrect but she insisted it was correct and they are the same price which obviously was as printed on their menu. We didnt't want to stay and argue over it so we left and took everything to go. I've worked in Restaurants for as long as i've lived here and this place needs work on their customer service and giving their repeat guest a better attitude . The food taste great but we will never be back here again."}
{"text":"So good, much better than other Filipino restaurants I've tried, almost as good as Mom's food ! Nice atmosphere and friendly staff. Pork sinagang was delicious. All they need now is some San Miguel beer!"}
{"text":"The best homemade Filipino food  since grandmas. The staff was so friendly it's been years since I've had that kind of food so they helped me order which was so helpful ."}
{"text":"My Mom told me to go to this new (new to me) fillipino restaurant. I didn't have anytime so ordered a to-go meal. Let me tell you that it was delicious! The fried Bungos portion can feed for two an was crispy and had that tang flavor. Also the mungo guisado soup fantastic. Wow like the flavor was balanced and not salty at all.   Overall the service was friendly and welcoming which was very surprising.  As a Filipino American I really enjoyed everything and recomended this place highly."}
{"text":"The two ladies I was with swear its the best Filipino food outside of Manila, and they've been all over the Daly City and Toronto with 20 years in North America to speak of.  One sister noted they do not use any Mama Sita's or the like, she noted the taste toasted rice and boiled peanuts in the Kare-Kare. The Bagoong Fried rice rocked the house. And their two item combos can't be beat. A family run joint that really takes pride in authentic cooking.  Its worth a taxi ride from the strip to get a Taste of Home ala Manila."}
{"text":"Came back to visit Vegas after moving out of Nevada. Getting Filipino food by my neck of the woods is tough. This was a great place. Food was on point and service was fast and friendly. Wish this place was around when I was a local."}
{"text":"Been here once and fell in love with the okoy... Yummy! The performer was really good with his guitar and choice of music. I will definitely come back and try more food in the menu."}
{"text":"So I think I'm not the only one has a poor experience (customer service ) in this pinoy restaurant . The guy with the \"hat\" flip on the back of his head ??? Which me and my hubby think very unprofessional way when your working in the restaurant service ! Every time he pass by in our table and I ask for something he just looks at you then walk away ! like he didn't hear me or anything doesn't even respond nicely to you . And as me and my hubby watch him the way he took order to other table he looks unhappy , he stands and lean on the wall or booth while taking orders ?!!! Who does that ??? Waiter ??? If your unhappy with the kind of job you have go find something  else that fits to your bad personality Mr . Waiter ??!!  (hats flips on the back of his head ) you just ruining the image of the Pinoy restaurant ! Who do you think you are Mr . Hats flips on the side ?! Food is good but the server is bad . So I'll give 1 star . I don't think I will comeback in this place which there are so many Filipino restaurant in this valley to try for . So thanks for the bad expedience Mr. Waiter with the hat while serving food ! (Flip on the back )"}
{"text":"Came here to meet up friends and enjoy this amazing restaurant. I just want to say the food was excellent and had all the right flavor profiles especially with us ordering during the late part of the day. I would recommend the Lechon Kawali to meet your Lechon needs lol. Staff was friendly and did not rush us at all.   Keep up the good work. We had a large party and were well taken care of. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Attended a party here, cute restaurant. They have a seperate hall for occasions and the set could have been more fluid, but for the amount of guests and commotion, it made do.  Foods alright, they had people serving you at the party, which I didn't appreciate when I asked for specific cuts in my kare kare they gave a side eye. Unnecessary interaction for a small request for a piece of beef.   The fried chicken breast was a bit dry, and the rice was undercooked. I liked the sago gulaman drink. A little more blander than I hoped for, but authentic home cooked Filipino food . The middle of vegas.  Restrooms need some tlc."}
{"text":"3.5 stars overall. I actually had planned to go to the Jamaican place 4 doors down, but I read all the negative customer service comments that we ended up here.   Saturday night dinner around 8.  Place seats about 60 or so.  It was not busy at all, only 3 other parties there.  There was Latin salsa music playing, and then I realized that they actually have a banquet hall where you can do private parties, so I thought that was interesting and convenient.  Most Filipino restaurants are casual and serve family style.  We had:   Adobo Rice w/ chicken- $7.99, 4 stars, alright  Crispy Pata - $14.99, 4 stars, not enough meat... Pancit Canton/Bihon - $7.99, 3 stars.  Too wet 1 scoop rice - $1.25, just in case adobo rice is too salty 1 Halo Halo Overload - $5.99, 5 stars  I liked that none of my orders were super salty.  I've had many Filipino restaurants where food was just doused in soy sauce or salt.   Portions - 4.5 Value - 5 Service - 3.5.  Friendly, just not attentive enough, too lax.  Wait was 15 minutes and reasonable.   Atmosphere - 4"}
{"text":"I had high hopes when I heard about this place. To be honest, it was not the best. I was given really dry tocino, over cooked longanisa, and over cooked lumpiang Shanghai. I also asked for my eggs to be sunny side up, but that too was over cooked. I couldn't really taste anything from the tocino and longanisa. The best part of the meal was the Halo Halo.   Maybe other dishes would have tasted better, but I was pretty disappointed with what I was given.   Other than the food, the restaurant is clean and the employees were polite."}
{"text":"I love love love this place. I am a lot closer to DT's and I drive my whole family's butts all the way to flamingo to eat here. The service is quick and the food is just simply delicious. Tinolang manok is my daughters fav... Btw she is only 18 months old.. She's a picky eater but when she smells this soup... She goes crazy.. Lol beef pinakbet-inihaw na baboy- pork skewers- chicken adobo- fresh lumpia- halo halo- super super super yummy. The service is fast... Compared to the one closer to me... I'm glad this place opened up."}
{"text":"Food is okay, don't really like this location. The a/c does not work here and I'm showering in my sweat. Don't go to this location go to the one by the south outlet."}
{"text":"We just came to vegas for our last stop in our mini vacation and craving for filipino food.. the resto that we're supposed to go to is already closed at 6pm so I decided to search here in yelp for another one, 'til I remember that I bookmarked this resto.. So we went here for our saturday dinner.. the interior looks good, it's like a newly built fil resto along flamingo rd.. so we asked our server and she told me that they've been there for quite awhile.. My husband was craving for pork sinigang and I was craving for pork sisig (both pork but vacation is not the right time for diet, fyi.. hehe) After serving it.... here are my reviews..  pork sinigang - if you know how the authentic sinigang taste like.. it's supposed to be \"sour\" and the taste of \"fish sauce\" and \"tamarind\" are supposed to be there... it's also a real plus if they do it with pork belly \"liempo\".. so glad that they actually mixed it perfectly!  pork sisig - they have what I was expecting! Served it in a sizzling plate with raw egg.. omg!!! and the aroma was to die for!  My husband was eyeing their halo-halo since we started so we ordered it even if we're both full! It has a good presentation.. alot of mixed fruit and an ube ice cream with pinipig for topping! He told me that it lacked sweetness.. but I don't like it too sweet.. ..a plus for me too when we're all done and on our way to our ride until I saw our server running after us holding my shades that I forgot.. kudos to you girl!  To sum it all.. it was a two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the better Filipino restaurants in the Las Vegas area. It is more upscale than the other Filipino restaurants I have been to. The restaurant has tons of seating to accommodate large groups and they also have a dedicated room for private parties.  The food here is delicious. Usually with Filipino restaurants a certain dish would have a slightly different taste based on the person cooking. Not here, the food tasted like I expected it to taste.  We had no issues with the service as some reviewers have mentioned. The servers were very attentive to our needs even though they had a private party in the other room to take care of."}
{"text":"I lived in Las Vegas for 2 years and I regularly come here for lunch or dinner and even treats desserts. I moved to CA and came to visit new years eve. So far this is the BEST Filipino food ever. Staff are courteous, alert and friendly. Food are delicious close to home cooking and at very reasonable price.  I will be back before going back to LA for lunch hahahha."}
{"text":"Great Filipino place. Everything we ordered was to our likening. Pinakbet was Not salty just perfect. Bbq pork stick."}
{"text":"7 of us were seated right away on a busy Sunday night. There was a singer/guitarist providing entertainment. Lots of big Filipino family gatherings. We ordered the kamayan boodle combo good for 4-5 people. We picked crispy pata, binagoongan pork, okoy, grilled bangus, atchara, ensaladang talong and it came with rice and pansit . Huge serving good for 7 people for $60. If you're craving good home cooked Filipino food, this is a good pick."}
{"text":"Service was incredibly poor. The kid with the backwards hat dragging his feet took his order from leaning on the booth seat behind me with his feet crossed at his ankles. Took my order then walked away. Lol ok??? Did you get my order yes or no? I was super confused. So 10 min after the order (25min after being there) I went to grab my drink. Oh wait, no one took my drink order! The sweet lady I grabbed took it, but never came back because she sent a man I have never seen chewing on a tooth pick asking me if I received my drink.... Really?? -_____- do you see that a drink has made it to my table sir??? So eventually I had a drink delivered. 30 min after being there my lunch special came out with the kid dragging his feet and his backwards hat again. Drops it off, not a single word, then leaves. I got into eating my food and it was cold. NOT cold from sitting there. Cold as, I just took this out the freezer and defrosted it and gave it to you cold. Couldn't tell anyone so I just sucked it up and ate it. Food was actually pretty good to where I can see the potential if they were to take every dish serious, but in this case, it was ok. It was almost like an episode of Kitchen Nightmares. Not the normal episode. The kind where your shocked at how the business is ran."}
{"text":"Price was reasonable, food was great and the portion was big!!!!.to some Filipino food lover out there if you are looking for great food this is the place hands down........"}
{"text":"Going back again to try the other dishes.Maybe have some of our dinner meetings there.Homey atmosphere.Friendly.Will definately do take out Loni Catapang Andal Phil Am Lions President 2014"}

{"text":"Very good food and wide variety of dishes from different provinces of Philippines.  Service excellent and servers very courteous and efficient.  We had the pancit canton, pusit inahaw (grilled squid) chicken afritada and okoy,.a.deep fried shrimp and vegetable dish.  Portions were good and prices reasonable.   We visit Las Vegas annually and this will be our regular Pinoy restaurant.  Very good and having them cater a birthday tomorrow.  Highly recommend if you are in this part of Las Vegas"}
{"text":"And were back here at D Pinoy joint with the whole family this time! Love this place  as alwys the staff are really  nice and Im satisfied with the foods."}
{"text":"We came here over the weekend and really enjoyed the food so we decided to come back again today.  We ordered our food and everything came out surprisingly fast so my husband and I were excited to eat but once we started to dig in we realized the only thing warm on our plates was the rice.  Everything else was cold.  We told the waitress and she took the food back to the kitchen.  2 minutes later she came back out with our plates and it was obviously just stuck in the microwave because the meats were nuked.. too rough to eat.  :( We couldn't eat it and I really don't think we will be returning again.  Big disappointment."}
{"text":"My taste for Filipino cuisine is always compared to my gramma's cooking... Obviously, no one can ever come close, until I paid a visit to this establishment. I devoured the Lechon Kawali and Bulalo. It was a taste of home sickness. I originate from Cali and now I miss both my grams and my whole family. It is amazing how a taste, a smell, a touch can bring so many good/bad feelings back instantaneously; my hats off to the chef for sparking such a warm feeling in my belly. I especially admire the great hospitality and efficient service that makes me proud to be a Filipino."}
{"text":"Ordered catering for 70 pieces of egg roll and was pretty good. Visited the place before ordering it and everyone was very nice and place was clean, no funky smells. The lady worker was very accommodating."}
{"text":"I came here with my family for lunch. A guy who was bussing the table sat us down and took our order. We ordered the Platter for 4 and an oxtail soup since the platter did not come with a soup. We were given a glass of water each and a bowl each for our soup. We were given the appetizer \"Okoy\" first while waiting for the rest of our order. When the rest of the order came, there were more \"Okoy\" in it.  We ran out of water, the first glass that was served was never refilled. Our soup never came too. So we decided to take the rest of the foods home. Since no one was checking on our table, I stood up to ask for our bill. To the lady cashier and probably the owner, I mentioned that our soup never came. She inquired on whether I really put an order. I said there are bowls on our table for the soup. Then one of the guys said in Pilipino that I should have waved to get their attention and told them that our soup wasn't brought yet. Thinking to myself, I am not running for an office to be waving. Besides, their staff should anticipate our needs rather than wait for us to call their attention. Anyway, the lady tried to find out who took our order. After finding it out, he asked the person to come over. The guy that took our order came and asked if I ordered the soup. I said yes and that's why the bowls were brought to our table. Then his cell phone rang. Instead of finishing our conversation, he answered his cell and walked away talking on the phone. To make things worse, I was charged for the Okoy which was supposed to be part of the platter. The cashier said she would give us the refund but it took already more than 5 minutes and the refund wasn't brought to our table. We then decided to leave. On our way out, the lady waved at me asking me to wait for my money. I just looked at her and we all continued to step out of the restaurant. That was my first visit."}
{"text":"Great food great portions . We ordered a bunch of different plates to try everything delicious authentic best restaurant food I've ever had. Lumpias and pancit with the mixture of noodles my favorite"}
{"text":"I ordered for take-out. They didn't give sauce for the okoy, which was undercooked. I brought this to their attention by contacting them online before posting this review. Sadly it's been several days and no one responded. I have no complaints about the other location."}
{"text":"I'm very critical on Filipino food. Maybe a little bias since I like the my moms traditional cooking.  The reason for my 3star review is primarily on the wait time. I ordered my food to go but took longer than expected. I did however appreciate the way they packed the food. The sinigang was great. The chicken adobo was not my favorite but the lumpia was tasty."}
{"text":"The best chicharon bulaklak in Las Vegas! This is definitely a spot you need to check out if you're craving Filipino food in Las Vegas! Us coming from LA where were smothered with Filipino food places around, this spot will definitely hit the spot!"}
{"text":"My 1st time here, we'd always pass by this place or even popped our heads in but they are always busy and crowded. Im sure almost every Filipinos have the same thought in their minds just like me. . . . Will the food taste good!?!? Trust me, i was skeptical too but i finally tried it with my inlaws and it was great, true filipino dishes here and not tooo oily. Our server was very nice and quick with our orders."}
{"text":"Love their Veggie Lumpia, we went to this restaurant instead after having a bad experience at another restaurant Friendly staff, small space but the food was good!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite guilty-pleasures is trying out various restaurants. In 2008 I was introduced to Pinoy (Philippines) food while living in California.  Since relocating to Las Vegas it's been a challenge finding the same service & quality food combination that's more available at Filipino restaurants in CA (my experience until just recently). There is a very good Filipino restaurant in Henderson (will write a review on them another time); I also enjoy Max's on the Eastside; but this D'Pinoy Joint on West Flamingo has thus far been my Favorite here in Las Vegas. And the fried chicken is as good as Max's...and the friendly service here has also been outstanding the three times I have eaten here with my wife."}
{"text":"2nd time at this place. Came in on a tuesday after lunch not many people there and hoping this time around service would be better.... i came back because the food is actually ok. The last time I was here service was very slow and lacking... its like your invisible. Sad to say that even on a tuesday with only 4 tables occupied that the service is still very much bad.... they sat us down 10 minutes later i had to stand up to get the menu... they didnt even give us the menu....... then 15 minutes later nobody comes to ask if u want to order... had to stand up and order at the bar... I am really hoping management would see this... Good food but very bad service.... hire more people or better employees please. Service is what most people here on yelp complain about. Do something about it!"}
{"text":"not really what I expected BUT the place was clean the food was good. I had the lechon kawali, the kids had sweet spaghetti and loved it. There was also live entertainment during lunch!   overall if i'm ever on that side of town again, I will likely stop in again."}
{"text":"Dinner Saturday night.  Lumpia average. Pork belly tonkatsu was a Japanese spin on lechon with panko coating that works well. The oxtail kare kare was bland, until I notice the condiment they brought out with it.  OMG!  It was a shrimp paste that totally transformed the dish.  We like it so much we ask to buy some.  The chef came out and explained to us that they don't make enough of it to sell.  He did give us an 1 oz container to take home.  I will come back for the shrimp paste, and it will go on everything I ordered."}
{"text":"We love philippino food the only reason we go here is that its less than 5 minutes from our house and I'm always craving sinigang. But  expect the worst service. No matter the time of day or the day of the week. Always NEED TO FLAG DOWN a server and if you do expect her (the older lady and the younger lady with the pony tail that goes down to her mid back) to frown at you and give you attitude + wait for your water refill+ slam your utensils down if they forget it+ don't bother them when theyre watching tv. You kight need to go to the counter to place your order and pay for your food, after waiting 15+ minutes The service of the place has greatly declined at least the food hasn't..."}
{"text":"Came here to take my filipino mom to get some lunch. Didn't know what to expect but I'm glad we came here! The kare kare was the best one I have ever tasted. The chicken skin is so yummy and fried right. The lechon kawali is just the right amount of crispy! The service needs to get a bit better but I am giving this place a 5 star because the food is oh so delicious!"}
{"text":"Just came here for my little sister's birthday (1/28/18). We usually go here for our family get-together, so they are quite accommodating when you call ahead regarding large parties. The food is good and filling, they do have a service charge of 18% for parties of 6 or more which I usually add a few more dollars. The servers are kind to us, and they definitely do their best especially when we visit & they are busy.   We didn't mention beforehand that it was my little sister's birthday, but one of the server asked my little sister if she'd like them to sing to her and she said yes. They were quite sweet for doing something like that for an eight year old."}
{"text":"Live music and great food, what else is there? This restaurant is a little out of the way, but inside there's a lot of tables (but it's always very busy). The food is a hit from home, if you're from the Philippines and they have EVERYTHING. It takes a little while for you to get seated and for them to get your order, but that's because they're so busy. There's a stage upon which an old man serenades the restaurant and he's a really good singer, but I think he sings a lot of folk songs???"}
{"text":"You might be thinking.. two stars? Really now?! Don't get me wrong. The food is excellent! Just exactly how you think it should be, or should I say-- it almost tasted like you're home. The only thing that threw me and family off was the older lady that was serving us. It said on the door they close at 10pm, we walked in at 9pm, leaving us and them only an hour left. There were quite amount of people in the store, and we're the last ones that walked in. She seen us stepped in but just glared at us and didn't say anything. And so we patiently waited til they give us a seat. While we were eating we noticed a long strand of hair in our big bowl of rice and asked if she could change it, she said yes but she has a frown on her face as she talked. She came back with a \"new\" bowl of rice and just slammed it on our table and walked away. Little by little people are starting to leave.. When we finished eating, it was still 9:45, leaving them 15 more minutes before they totally close. We asked for to go boxes and unfortunately she was the only one we can ask it from, since everyone is doing their own thing. It made us so uncomfortable eating there that we didn't even enjoy the delicious foods they offer. I'm not saying stop coming here, FOOD IS GREAT PEOPLE. The only thing that threw us off was the POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. IF YOU DID NOT WANT US TO EAT AN HOUR BEFORE YOU CLOSE, YOU COULD HAVE SAID SO. WE COULD HAVE LEFT QUIETLY. NOT GIVING US POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE MAKING US WANT TO LEAVE"}
{"text":"Excellent food. We ordered the pork sisig, crispy pata, and noodles. My family and I are satisfied.  One of us asked for a free cup of soup and the waitress came out with free soup for all of us. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an authentic Filipino food place with great surroundings....you have to try this place!!! My mom's coworker recommended this place to her and we came here with a big group (family in town) and ordered about 10 different dishes.  This place is so home-feeling like, and it's clean, too, which is a plus. I'm Filipino, so I'm very picky with the Filipino food I'm eating, but as soon as I tried that first bite of adobo....win!!!! It's like my taste buds are already tingling as I'm typing this.  The great thing about their menu is that they have a variety of food you can order. If you want some noodles like pancit, they have that. If you like chicken, they have that. If you want some vegetables, they have that as well. Go-to Filipino food restaurant for sure! And it's super affordable, nothing is overpriced for the taste that you're getting. Our bill came up to be $144, but there were about 10 of us. They also charge 18% gratuity of parties 7 or more. Service was great, every time we needed some help, we just called someone and they came up right away."}
{"text":"Great service and excellent food! You have to try the Pork Tonkatsu... Masarap!!! They have a wide variety of traditional Filipino foods. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Family operated with family recipes and (generous) family portions...Really good food without traveling 9000 miles! Sisig, chicken adobo, lechon kawali and lechon paksiw and...so good...crispy pata! ...all accompanied with garlic rice...D'Best!"}
{"text":"This is a hard one but here it goes... The food was good but I've had better. Since my mom is Filipino I knew what I was getting on my plate or at least had a lot of the dishes growing up, but what kinda sucked was a friend was with us and was somewhat a picky eater and told me \"if I could see a pic of what this stuff is I would love to try\" but just reading and never trying it before was to much of a risky move for her. So she didn't eat with us. So some pics on the menu would be nice for the people wanting to see what lechon is. Bc I ordered the wrong one, (thanks to my mom and waiter) i wanted the crispy one but got the one that was in the brown sauce and  the meat was super dry! Esp being in a sauce which reminded me of 3 day old leftovers or something?! Not trying to be rude but those lumpias (egg rolls) was a joke. I never seen an egg roll smaller then my pinky!  So being 7$ for 12 smaller then a 3 year olds index finger is just not worth it sorry. It's nothing to go outta your way for but it's there if you want different foods. Keep in mind there are a lot of Filipino restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"So, I live in the Northeast and am pretty much the only token Asian in my rural community. With a Caucasian husband and the nearest (read: only) Asian market almost an hour's drive away, I don't often get the opportunity to eat rice or my favorite Filipino food. Of course I pig the hell out when I visit my family in Vegas! I arrived on Wednesday earlier this week, and my mother and sister brought me to this place.  Service was quick and friendly, and the location seemed to have lots of space and seating. Cost was reasonable, considering we ordered tons of food. We ended up ordering lumpia shanghai, torta, dinuguan, tosilog, kare kare, and daing. Entrees weren't humongous, but they were of a decent serving size that we were able to share and eat family style. I thought the food was really good, with the except of the torta, but that was my mistake. In my head I really wanted fried torta, (feggplant dipped in egg and fried), but I didn't read the description carefully and ended up getting steamed eggplant with chopped tomatoes, onions, and mango. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but it was a dish that this girl could manage at home in the boondocks. Like I said, if I'm going to eat Filipino food, it better be something I don't know how to cook or get easily!  Aside from the torta, everything tasted great. I think the shining dish was the dinuguan--really fresh and flavorful. The reason I gave this place 4 stars was because there were so many flies! Was it meant to be part of the atmosphere? Going for the authentic Filipino food stand feel? I don't know, but having to swat at flies every two seconds wasn't the dining experience I wanted to have while enjoying my Filipino food."}
{"text":"Excellent food & service. We ordered a bilao & it was so good. Requested for a sinigang soup for us to pay & they gave it to us for free. I highly recommend this joint. We are all out of towners. Yummy Filipino food"}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago and was quite satisfied with the food. Came in today ordered togo and food was not as good compared from my last visit. There's a lack of consistency on how food was prepared. The fresh lumpia that I ordered was mostly carrots and the pork tonkatsu was very chewy compared to how nicely cooked it was previously. I would not be coming back anytime soon, i may need to try out other spots. 3 stars because the service is good and place is very clean."}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth the drive if you don't live in the area. My boyfriend and I ordered the breakfast Silogs and the appetizer of fried chicken skins. Everything was delicious. Fried chicken skins are a must try! The silogs reminded us of real home cooked Filipino breakfast. The only thing was the melon juice we ordered was a little too sweet. Definitely try this place out next time you're craving Filipino food!"}
{"text":"Ok so I gave this place 3 chances to keep me as a regular customer. I've gone 3 weeks in a row and I'm just so disappointed.  Ok so EVERY time I've gone my food is never fresh and hot.  The kare kare is always cold! Wth???? It's so sad because it'd be amazing if it was actually hot! The chicken adobo is super greasy and just bleh. I had some other beef stew dish and man, the potatoes were so old! They were squishy and not cooked and old! The bell peppers were not cooked and the beef was like mush. Like it was all just old and reheated.  The fried chicken skin and lechon kawali are ok. They should be since they're just deep fried.... The service just sucks.  Their kutsinta is very blah. The garlic peanuts are good. All I can say is that I must be really craving some Filipino food and not wanting to drive further to come back to this place.  Very disappointing. I feel like it was a waste of my money. Should've drove an extra few miles to another place..."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for Filipino food. Their food is tasty and prices are reasonable. I love their Pinakbet (vegetable dish) and their inihaw na baboy (grilled pork). Their Lechon kawali (deep fried pork belly) is also good... The halo-halo is very tasty and delicious... This may be my first check-in but have been here many times and will continue to return here..."}
{"text":"So disappointed!!!!! The staff was soooooooo nice and kind! But the food was an epic fail!!!! Especially considering some of the prices. The fresh lumpia was horrible, the Palabok was bland, the regular lumpia was tasty but was fried too hard! The fried pork belly and the Dinaguan was just decent. The fried whole chicken was disappointing as well. I had high hopes but won't be going back here."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. I did not expect their kamayan platter to be that huge a serving. We were pleasantly surprised. Their food is even better than most pinoy restaurants in california. We will definitely be back! Try their crispy pata and chicken skin! YOLO!"}
{"text":"It's my first time to eat in this place today with my friend but i feel disappointed because i order a Lomi for to go and when i want to eat for dinner I noticed that they did not put the Egg noodles on it..."}
{"text":"I'm always up for trying new restaurants especially in Vegas! This place was recommended to us by my aunt and uncle and I was excited to try out.  The menu here consists of various appetizers (ranging in prices from $5.99 to $12.99 and consisting of favorites such as lumpiang shanghai, chicaron bulaklak to non-traditional shrimp tempura and fish balls), noodles (all priced at $7.99 and include bihon, canton, miki, malabon and spaghetti) and beef, pork, seafood and vegetable dishes ($6.99 to $12.99 in price).  My party ordered a lot of seafood dishes and I am not a seafood eater so my review will mostly be on the non-seafood dishes that I tried.   I first tried the kare kare. Their oxtail kare kare is $12.99 and comes with oxtail cooked in creamy peanut sauce with beef tripe and veggies. The dish was small in size for $12.99! I liked that there were a good mix of veggies and the oxtail was pretty good as well but there seemed to just not be a lot in this dish. The portion size was small for the price.   The other dish I got try was a little bit of the shrimp tempura. I  tried the veggies from the shrimp tempura and was fond of the batter that they had. It was slightly on the sweet side. This dish was also $12.99.   Lastly I got to try was the pork binaggongan with eggplant. This is lechon kawali sauteed in shrimp paste topped with fried talong. I normally don't eat shrimp paste but decided to just try this a little bit and it wasn't bad. The shrimp paste was not too strong in flavor and the lechon kawali was nice and crispy.   Tastewise the food was good but i think the dishes were fairly small for the prices. This place is kinda pricey and I would've expected a more generous portion.   As for drinks, I chose to get a sago gulaman. Theri sago gulaman came with a lot of different ingredients. It had baby sago and red and green gulaman. It was a very pretty drink with a decent amount of sago and gulaman but needed to be more sweet. It was a little on the bland side.  My first experience at D'Pinoy Joint was all in all ok."}
{"text":"I just ate here today and let me tell u.. It's really good we got the sizzling sisig and it had an egg on it.. I've never had it with an egg before but I like it.. We also got Pancit Canton Bihon I loved it.. Also the Tonkankatsu out some shit was fried just right"}
{"text":"We were crazy to have come to this place to cater my daughter's 1st Birthday and Baptism when they just opened.  Nobody to tell us how their food was and their yelp back then was pretty much down to their first review.    Kathy helped us when we arrived.  She answered all of our questions the best she could.  Even speaking to her on the phone to add more food later on, she was very helpful and efficient.    We ordered 3 trays of everything.  Tonkatsu: their special version of Lechon Kawali.  Probably the best lechon Kawali-ish that we've ever had.  It stays crunchy even hours later.  It was a hit.  Chicken curry: flavorful and popular at our party.  People kept asking who cooked it.  Inihaw pork: I'm guessing they're ilocano, because this reminded me of how my ilocano family would serve Inihaw pork.  Cut in chunks and mixed with tomatoes and onions.  Pretty good but wished they cut the meat smaller.  Pork Menudo: really good.  Everyone liked it.  Lechon: yes, a whole roasted pig.  We were apprehensive about ordering a lechon during this party because all the other lechons  we've ordered in town have been nasty.  Since it was a special occasion, we pretty much bought it to make our food presentation better lol.  Luckily, it tasted really good.  Didn't have that nasty, pig smell.  Skin  was super crunchy and the meat was tender and flavorful.    Overall, I'd have to say they earned their 5 stars from me.  I hope to have the same great experience next time.  Wish they were closer to southern highlands."}
{"text":"I just removed this from my bookmark. Recommended by our family physician and we were in the area so we had our weekly dinner here. Not good. Never coming back.   We arrived a little before 9pm and I asked what time they close, the server said 10pm. Ok, an hour is good. I specifically said party of 6 and the hostess (with no eye contact) led us to a table in the middle of the restaurant. Instead, I requested to be seated in the corner somewhere where my family and I can freely talk and catch up. There was only one other family there but still, this is what I prefer. We sat down, at a table perfect for 6 and she asks if it's ok that she doesn't put the tables together. I'm ok with that, since our table could accommodate all of us. Then when my other 2 sons arrived and sat down, she asked if there were 14 of us, I said no, there's 6...She then comments, under her breath, \"kanina pako dito\" not finishing her sentence. I heard this but decided to ignore her cause I don't want anyone spitting on our food. I did feel like getting up though and leaving but it was late and we were hungry.  Minus stars for that already. Your staff is what people see when they first enter your establishment. Your first impression to which she has failed you. You guys on Yelp should already know that I'm not picky, I'm fair and reasonable. But I expect service with a smile and some eye contact, that's pretty easy right?   The server on the other hand had a better personality. He took our orders, made suggestions and was quick getting our food out. We really tried to enjoy our dinner but it just wasn't working out.   1. Egg rolls- I only ordered 1 but when my 2 other boys arrived they were all gone so I ordered another one. Egg rolls are egg rolls but I would not be craving for theirs.  2. Vegetable lumpia- my son who's enjoyed every vegetable lumpia he has ever tasted made a comment that the vegetable cuts were too big. He had one and he was done. When usually, he eats them all.  3. House special fried rice- it was nothing special  4. Sizzling Sisig- my 11 year old ordered this thing I called the splattering Sisig. Why? It went straight for my son's eye. That plate was way too hot.   Look, I'm gonna cut this short. We ordered okoy, Bicol express, kare-kare, tocilog and bulalo. Our total was $121. My boys can eat, our whole family can. But we just didn't enjoy the food here. I asked for a to-go box and the hostess came up and just set it on the table. No offer to box up our left overs even from the server. Wow, the food wasn't that good and the service was even worse.   I seriously don't see this place surviving."}
{"text":"This food is TALAGANG SARAP!!!!   We ordered so much food: Pork Sinigang, Pork Sisig, Bangus Sisig, Bistek, Pancit Palabok, Lumpia Shanghai, Tocilog, and Longsilog.  everything. Was. amazing.   To say the least :) MUST TRY FOLKS!  Really wish I took photos but we were too busy eating"}
{"text":"Everyone is in beast mode the moment they put those food in the table, I couldn't even take pictures of it. That's how good the food.. try the binagoongan crispy pata with eggplant deeeeeliiiissshhhhhh to the bones! Yummmmmm"}
{"text":"Finally a good Filipino restaurant that I can enjoy. Love the live music and awesome service."}
{"text":"This place is horrible we we're the only costumer at that time we ordered okoy,  miki-bihon and pork sisig and the server  even asked us if we  wanted pork or bangus so we told her we wanted pork but after waiting forever for our sisig they brought the wrong one on top of that the to wait again for god knows how long  WTF.  If I  can give it negative stars I would but the only reason why I'm even giving it two stars is because the lady from the kitchen or maybe she's the owner was very apologetic and offered to give us discount on our bill.  Remains to be seen."}
{"text":"My new favorite filipino restaurant. Love the sago gulaman and the sizzling bistek. Very friendly people too!!"}
{"text":"This used to be my go-to place for good, affordable and well-portioned Filipino food...for someone who's born and raised the Philippines, finding a gem like this that TASTED like home is priceless...until recently. Prices went up and portions got smaller...way smaller. The taste...not worth the price anymore. I'll be sure to start searching again.."}
{"text":"Flies in our food! Spoiled Pinakbet! Bad Customer Service! RUDE MANAGER!  Went here for dinner for my niece's birthday and to also celebrate Father's Day. First thing was our waitress was rude and didn't even ask for drink order. As my sister ordered about 9 ala carte, the waitress says, \"is this all?\" First of all your serving your patrons no matter what they ordered. So we waited to get our food, then one of our orders was the pinakbet. Well, a friend of mine and my mom said that as they took a bite of the calabasa (squash), they noticed that it was spoiled. So we asked the waitress, that the pinakbet was spoiled, so she took it back to the kitchen. Then the manager came out, and asked what was the problem, and to mention she didn't apologize first of all. We then told her that the pinakbet was spoiled. She then defensively stated that everyone orders it and they didn't have any problems. Then my mom said, it's the calabasa, and you need to try what you served us. So the manager goes back into the kitchen, and comes back out. Her excuse was that it was accidentally mixed with something else. Again no apologies, she started to walk away, we told her that to just take it off our bill since the last dish haven't even arrived yet. Ok so fine, now here comes the kicker, my friend ordered a sago gulaman, and there it was in his ice, was a FLY! We didn't mention it, because we had enough. Then last thing, we asked for to go container, and one of the waiters brings us a black plastic bag, that reads, \"Not recommended for food storage.\" This black plastic bag is for food scraps, and the black bag looked like a doggie trash bag. Never will we ever eat here again!"}
{"text":"I really liked their Filipino food here at this sit-down restaurant!  We came here at lunch time and they had decent lunch specials on the menu.    We ordered a side of shanghai egg rolls which came with a side of sweet and sour sauce.  These came out fast and piping hot.  They were good.  The lunch special I ordered came with two entrees and a scoop of white rice.  We tried their pork adobo and 'lechon kawali' (fried pork belly).    The adobo was delicious, a great balance of soy sauce and vinegar.  Nothing overpowering, and the meat was very tender.  The lechon kawali was amazing.  They really pack the serving bowl with the pork belly so you are getting a lot for your money.     This by itself could have been enough for my wife and I, but I wanted to try the shrimp-paste (bagoong) fried rice.  This did not really compare to the flavor you get from the version at Goldilocks' filipino restaurant but it was ok.  I poured the adobo broth and it gave it a really good flavor! =)  The fried rice comes with chopped tomatoes, chopped mangoes, and pork pieces mixed in.  The food service was very fast and attentive.  The food came out very quickly, and the plating was really nice for a Filipino restaurant.  Will definitely come back when I have a Filipino food craving."}
{"text":"We always come here whenever I get the Filipino food craving and I'm too lazy to make it myself.  Kathy knows us.  We always order for our family gatherings."}
{"text":"Me and the entire family went to vegas for a family outing to celebrate my grandma's bday. So we figured after going to the orleans casino should stop by before heading back to wyndham. Greeting was good when we walk in the restaurant and they were all shocked cause we're 11 people and the server looked pissed when she saw a big group. Lol but anyways so we ordered and so you know old people are slow when making decisions on what to eat or so but she shouldn't be more patient and shouldn't be giving us an attitude. Then we ask her if the food comes with rice blah blah and she said no it doesn't come with a rice so we ordered rice about 6 orders cause some just went to eat soup and when our order came there was about 12 and the ones that we didn't order that she said doesn't come with a rice comes with a very big serving of rice!! I know right what a huge waste!! And so at the very beggining we told her that our checks is separate like for 3 checks. So there was a service fee  too and she expects you to give her huge tip. I even forgot to tell you after long hours of waiting, the vegetables in ginataang kalabasa was not fully cooked still raw."}
{"text":"I stopped by around 9pm and waited to be seated. One of the rude workers came up to us and told us that their last call is at 9pm. I told him that you guys don't close till 10pm though and he said I know but last call is at 9pm. Really? 1 hour till closing is last call? I understand if it's at 9:30 or 9:45 but 1 hour before closing is ridiculous. It's okay though I can take my business elsewhere. I'll never go back to this place again."}

{"text":"I ordered Party trays from this place and it was awesome. My order was delivered earlier than expected time, and the food was wrapped in very presentable manner, clean n beautiful. I totally recommend this place if you have a party. Food was excellent. I,ve always eaten at this restaurant and it's consistently great with party platters"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good & decently priced. I ordered the lunch special with lechon paksiw & beefstek. I also had the fresh lumpia with peanut sauce, fish balls, and torta. About $30 for everything. I would come again! Next I'm trying the kamayan! Mmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"The food and price was good.   The portions were more than big enough for our group of 3.    The only problem I have with this place is the service.   After being seated we had to flag someone down just to take our order and they never once came by to ask if we needed refills and not giving napkins .  The restaurant did not even have many other customers at the time.  Hopefully they improve their service."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a place to fill the void that Salo Salo Grill left since their horrible health inspections. I was going to actually keep on eating there, until my family went to eat dinner there before my wedding day and my mom's boyfriend got a bad case of diarrhea that night.  (Hopefully D' Pinoy Joint stays out of the SNHD's radar).  This place is up the street from Cafe de Cebu. I've had trouble with the wait time for food at Cafe de Cebu, especially when they're waiting on the lechon to be cooked/delivered, but I haven't had that issue here. Some of my favorite dishes here were the chicken skin and lechon. The tonkatsu lunch plate is also just another way of referring to lechon as well. I thought the crispy pata was a bit dry here, so I'll always get the lechon if I want to pig out. I like their Mang Tomas sauce, but I usually make my own sauce of 1 part soy sauce and 1 part lemon or lime.   The servers here have always been polite and efficient with us, and we visited soon after their grand opening. I'm just glad to have another Filipino option here on the Westside and hope the rest of the dishes I have yet to try do not disappoint. I have yet to save room for my favorite dessert, halo halo."}
{"text":"Great place. Filipinos alike seem to always flock here on the weekends. Haven't been here on a weekday yet. Service is fast and friendly. Great atmosphere and amazing filipino food."}
{"text":"Delicious dinuguan, crispy pata, and chicken adobo is yummy!"}
{"text":"Second time here. Is a simple neighborhood place look like run by a family servise is not great, but they friendly an they own way, but a food is excellent and a prices is even greater."}
{"text":"Felt a little guilty as we were craving some heart attack inducing food, but we came here last night and ordered take out. We've been meaning to try this place since it opened about half a year ago and finally got around to trying it.   We ordered the pork tonkatsu, binagoong fried rice, fried bangus, crispy pata, and friend chicken skins (yes, I said fried chicken skins). All in all, the food was really good.  -The pork tonkatsu was tasty and moist. Not tough at all.  -The crispy pata was really good, wasn't over fried, and had a lot of meat on it (bonus points). I'd go so far as to say it's the best crispy pata I've had here in Vegas.   -The binagoong fried rice was just okay. I was expecting a lot more flavor.  -The fried chicken skins were good, but I could only eat a few of those at a time because they were so high in fat and cholesterol. My body was literally screaming at me to stop eating them.  -I didn't eat any of the fried bangus, but the people who did said it was good.  -They included a large container of white rice free of charge.   Overall, each one of us enjoyed the food and it was a good value. Big portions for all items. The take out service was very friendly and quick.   We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from D'Pinoy Joint on a Thursday afternoon. The first time I called nobody answered but they picked up the second time I called. I never really eat Filipino food but a handful of times at my friends house. We ordered a little bit of everything to try everything. We ordered the pancit bihon! A 10! So yummy I would order this again and again. Next we ordered the Shanghai lumpia with ground meat and it was a 10! Last we ordered the lunch special of the chicken adobo. It was very salty and had a strong flavor. I didn't like how the chicken skin was still on there it freaked me out. I would give it a 7. Taste is awesome but texture not so much. We also ordered the melon drinks with melon shavings inside the drink. I really liked our experience and would definitely be returning for the pancit!"}
{"text":"When we first walked in, we noticed that the restaurant wasn't busy. Still, we had to wait 5-10 minutes to be seated, then another 10 minutes to give our drink orders. The sizzling bistek was one of the things we ordered.  The beef was literally immersed in so much oil, making the dish completely inedible. The waitress was so aloof and didn't even notice that we were dissatisfied when we told her not to box up this dish.  What's worse is that they declined to remove this item from our bill, considering this our fifth or sixth visit to this place.  Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time and money here. There are many other options for Filipino cuisine in LV."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Since the first time we found this place, the flavor have been consistent, I just wish the customer service is the same quality as the food. I recommend  the following: 1.okoy 2. Fish balls 3. Adobo rice 4. Binagoong rice 5. Sisig na bangus 6. Lomi.   Tried and wasn't impressed with their: 1. Dinuguan 2. Letchon kawali 3. Beef stik(steak?) The one with onions 4. Pinakbet.   The one I recommended are one of the best I have tasted, and have ordered them more than once and the flavor has always been on the spot. However- the 3 star is not about the flavor, it's for the poor customer service.  Everytime we come here we only always few interactions with the servers and the one over the counter. Servers seems to not care about the customers, they just want to deliver the food and that's it. Been here 4 times now and I they don't even say goodbye to you when you walk out- even on a night when your the only customer on the spot!  I like the flavor. Just wish they can have that warm welcoming feeling you get from other Filipino restaurants around."}
{"text":"Food here is authentic and has a home cooked taste to it.  We had dinner and came back for breakfast another day.  Hopefully they dont lose their touch or change because we definitely will he coming back when we are in Vegas again.  Very good Filipino food.  Kare kare, all silogs, bangus, pancit, lechon, halo halo etc."}
{"text":"Cousin was craving Filipino food when she was here to visit.  We found D' Pinoy Joint since they're open fairly later hours.  If anybody knows how Filipinos eat... it's a feast.  And that we did have for our small group of grubbers - a feast.    A thing we should try to avoid being a culture like this is PLEASE DON'T WASTE FOOD.  Leftovers for the next day.  Now that's one thing I learned not to be picky about.  As I've also learned the flavors sink in.  And how does it do with baked fish?  Oh eat that right away!  Don't want your fridge to be stenched.  Food was good though.  My auntie makes the best dinuguan however.  Their kare kare was A+.  Between the two, I'd play safe and introduce the peanut butter stew to newcomers.  Now if you've got a Chef Andrew Zimmern appetite, I'll dare you on the dinuguan.  For you fishy health eaters, go with the baked fish.  Be prepared to learn and eat with your hands Filipino style.  Fish is a kamayan food in our culture.  I have to say walking in we got a few stares too many.  I have heard that if I were to ever visit the Philippines, people will know I'm foreign by sight, scent, and attire.  Well we're not in the Philippines!!!  This is Vegas there are many Filipinos here.  Why did it still happen?!  One thing I can't stand is feeling uncomfortable while dining.  So goes my rating... but know that it's neutral cuz I still like the food."}
{"text":"We ordered the family meal which came in a 'bilao'. Good for 4-6 people. You can choose your food for the bilao and share it with your friends. Good presentation. The good- crispy pata (pork leg), pork binagoongan (cooked in shrimp paste), stuffed pusit (squid). The pancit bihon could use more flavor. We also had the perennial halo-halo for dessert. Service was good and fast."}
{"text":"How is this place not written up with a big fat \"F grade\"... Though the food is tasty enough you start to wonder if the secret ingredient to the lovely food is \"FLIES\"! Nothing like eating your food and feeling your outside at a picnic. It didn't stop at at having to constantly swat at flies landing on your food, but they were all over their bathrooms as well.. I will assume for sure they are also in the kitchen.  On top of that being forced to auto pay 18% tip to such a sour faced unfriendly waitress.. NOT AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"A happy filipino restaurant serving big families. I went here with my family, a party of 12 for lunchtime on Saturday. It wasn't too packed, but definitely large families filled the restaurant. I guess they are known for their family style of cooking. The food was delicious and delivered hot to our table. I definitely recommend trying the crispy pata, but be warned it will disappear pretty fast. A bit far from the strip, but it's definitely home cooking that you won't get at a hotel."}
{"text":"I really injoy the food here and it is hard to find a good place to eat these days, I will be back soon to eat more great food and bring my family here."}
{"text":"My bro and I went here last week during our annual Vegas Thanksgiving trip. It was a little bit of a drive from the strip, and as a visitor not to easy to find. We were greeted warmly as we sat to eat. We ordered the breakfast at any time specials and an order of lechon kawali (deep fried pork belly with liver sauce) for $8.99. This last dish was on the high side, and had lots of pure fat as opposed to meat and fat chunks, so, we deemed it as not a great value. The breakfast fare, tocino and longanisa (Filipino-style cured meat and sausage) were good and is par for the course. They did not have the Mafran banana red sauce on the table so you have to ask for it, first came a small portion, when we asked again, a more reasonable sized portion came. These are standard accompaniments for Filipino food, especially breakfast meats. Everyone was polite, so it gets a solid 3 stars...until we try it again next year, God-willing."}
{"text":"Although the food was good, the service was terrible. When we walked inside the restaurant, we were immediately seated because there were many empty seats. However, they realized that the tables they sat us at were already reserved. They then asked us to move. What kind of restaurant ask their customers to move when there are lots of empty seats available? Overall, the disappointing service overshadowed the food."}
{"text":"I ordred 2 Halo halo to go after I pay i asked a side of pinipig like a teaspoon worth. The older lady ( Kathy's mom) said we don't give a extra pinipig on a side bec it's expensive. Are you serious I pay $7 each. Every week  i order to go and ask for side of pinipig no problem. And she went to the kitchen asking all the employee who gave me an extra pinipig when I order to go."}
{"text":"If you like a good filipino breakfast served in the evening, a friend and I found this at D Pinoys.  We arrived for dinner/breakfast on weekday night, service was fast, and the food just hit the spot!"}
{"text":"It took 45 minutes to place a to go order for 3 entrees. There was no one was at the restaurant. The old lady had attitude and was so cheap with the rice. I ordered 3 entrees and she measured each scoop. I paid for an extra scoop of rice & was so good rude about it. I'm Not coming back"}
{"text":"We went around ten or so in the morning our coffee was meh and the food aside from taking over 30 min was cold. Colder then room tempurature. Im not from the area but i wouldnt go back"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by old coworker and I am glad I checked it out. Took my mom and husband here and ordered chicken bbq sticks, pancit, sinigang (fish) every thing tasted so good. My mom who usually complains was speechless and satisfied. Been here twice and will come back again and again."}
{"text":"This place was good for the first few times me and my girlfriend went, BUT the last 3 times we came back the food went from 5 star to 1 star. The levy on kawali was so hard and had dark burnt. The sisig was burnt. Both almost tasted like they got reheated a few times. The service was not good at all. A lot of them are just standing at the back, when I've been waiting for my entree for 45 minutes , when I asked about my order they totally forgot about it. Like have some professionalism. I thought I found my Filipino food place to go whenever I'm craving them, but I was wrong."}
{"text":"My relatives wanted Filipino food so here we were thanks to yelp. The dining area is alright but the food and service wasn't really good. Our dishes came out at all different times and the portions were kinda small for the price, especially the appetizers. I've had way tastier. I don't know what the options are around here for Filipino food but I'm sure there are better. Some things we got:  Lumpia shanghai - small portion and they looked like the frozen kind.  Crispy chicken skin - no flavor and just tasted like fat. Also other pictures had double the portion size than what we got.  Adobo fried rice - I love adobo fried rice, but I was so disappointed, the meat was shredded so much I could barely taste it, there was so much oil left on the plate after and it didn't really have flavor!  Lechon kawali - not that crispy and again didn't have flavor, just tasted oily and fatty.  Sinigang - the best thing we ordered, it was actually really good but everything else was such a let down! Meh..."}
{"text":"Yummy lunch with hubby off the strip! So at this point in our vaca we were both honestly a bit home sick. So going here and getting off the strip helped with that. And the chicken adobo helped even more :) So we shared a lunch special when you get to pick two of the 10 choices with some rice. We chose the chicken adobo and the lechon kawali. The pork belly was so crispy and delicious!! And like I said the chicken adobo just reminded me of someone's grandma making a nice big pot of curry and really made my tummy happy. And speaking of happy tummies.... we ended with an order of turons that came with three of them and a scoop of ice cream. The Turon had banana and jackfruit in them and a scoop of ice cream. It was perfection. Hubby was suspicious of it but soon found himself happily polishing off a second one lol."}
{"text":"Always had great experiences when dining in. Tapsilog was great and so is the Sinigang sa salmon sa miso. Only bad thing is when my cousin ordered a platter to go, the eggrolls weren't cooked through and the wrapper was raw inside. It was crunchy on the outside though."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this restaurant! Ordered crispy pata & Kare kare. Good location. Krispy pata not tender and crispy enough. :( Kare kare is okay, small portion. They give lots of rice though! But definitely will not come back."}
{"text":"Pros: Tasty food, friendly and receptive service, brand new place! Cons: Parking is a bit funky since they are at the end of the building  I recommend: Pancit bihon, binagoongan (bagoong) fried rice, beef bulalo (soft beef soup), melon juice  I've just moved to Las Vegas so I'm on the hunt for Filipino food after leaving my favorite place in San Diego behind. I chose this place because they have a website with their menu online! I'm hoping that they will add pictures to every menu item on their website so that my mom and I can let our stomachs and eyes order for us :). We called in our order and drove about 20 minutes to the restaurant. We showed up the day before their Grand Opening so we missed the restaurant when we drove down the road (they have a nice bright sign now though, so you can't miss it)! We were promptly greeted and our food was brought out right away.   My mom loves to talk so we enjoyed a fun conversation with everyone. They got us to try the melon juice and halo halo and I'm glad they did. The melon juice is like a shredded melon boba :). They add shaved ice to melon juice with shredded melon at the bottom. Super yummy- especially on a hot day. My mom and I couldn't agree on the halo halo though. I like simple halo halo while my mom loves \"loaded\" halo halo with tons of stuff (like the cup is full of beans and jellies and fruit) and D'Pinoy's halo halo is definitely more simple (maybe about a quarter full). I loved it but I'm sure my mom will ask for more fixings in hers next time. The Philippines might seem like a small country but there are many regional differences. Some people just prefer things a certain way because of the region they grew up in.   We ordered several things including lumpiang shanghai, fried bangus (milkfish), beef kaldereta, chicken curry, pancit bihon, binagoongan fried rice, and beef bulalo. I loved their pancit but my mom didn't care for the tofu in it so I took it all :). The chicken curry has bones but the chicken is very soft and will fall right off it. The beef in the beef bulalo is super soft and absolutely delicious. The binagoongan rice wasn't what I was expecting (it has mangoes and tomatoes on the side- never seen that before) but it was absolutely delicious. Very unique and very tasty! Everything was very good, very soft, and cooked very well.   Unfortunately, we were missing one thing in our order and didn't notice until we got home (oops)! The place isn't that close to us so my mom called back and told them what happened. They were very apologetic and promised to make it right when we return. And we WILL return! I want to try the pork tonkatsu, dinuguan, sinigaang, and the sizzling bistek! This might be my new go-to place in Las Vegas for the food of my people!"}
{"text":"Food is great! Food servers were courteous and friendly. For breakfast I chose longsilog, bangsilog  Last week I was with my family at D'Pinoy's for dinner. We were 10 in the group we tried hapag party tray on banana leaves which they said is good for a party of 10- 12. They were right We had leftovers for to go. Our selection that night: crispy pata, lumpia Shanghai, pork sisig, whole fried chicken, chicharon bulaklak, and included was itlog maalat salad and pancit canton. There was also small portion of steamed rice. It was a delight! All the food were delicious. I was also told they have a private party room with a karaoke unit and dance floor. I went inside to check, spacious. Minimum of 25 people, at $20.00 per/head (as of Oct 20,2016) including 4-5 dishes and between 4 to 5 hrs stay. Sounds reasonable. Thanks to Evelyn, we'll definitely be back soon. Chow!"}
{"text":"I used the live right down the street from here and was regular customer when they first opened but since I moved farther I haven't had d Pinoy in almost 2 years! I found myself suddenly craving pancit palabok and remembered I ordered that regularly here when I was pregnant. Got my order to go and it was just as I remembered. The flavor is just right noodles and shrimp perfectly cooked and they don't put ground chicharon like most places they put fresh chopped lechon soooooo yummy! Will be back again soon to try the dinuguan hopefully it's the same deliciousness I remember"}
{"text":"The food is really good. So much flavor of the food that I have tried.  The sigsig na bangus.. must try.. you won't regret it. So much flavor on every bite. It just melts on your mouth. Binagoong na rice. Omg one of the best... it really blends together with the sigsig na bangus. It makes you want to eat more and more and won't stop due to the goodness of the food. The lumi was actually good. The soup was good especially on a cold weather. The calamari was okey. Had better. So much flour on it. I was mostly eating the flour instead of the squid itself. Even though there flour has flavors on them. Other than that, overall the food was really good. I would actually recommend this place."}
{"text":"Our Cousin recommended this place. Great Filipino food in Las Vegas! The Chicken Adobo, Pork Sinigang and Crispy Pata are awesome and are large portions. The service is awesome, they are friendly and very attentive to their customers, even how busy they got. Oh and be sure to order the halo-halo it's delicious! Thanks D'Pinoy!"}
{"text":"FOOD: Whoever gave this restaurant 3-5 stars, Wow! Their food was bland. We ordered a lot of food, and the only dish that had flavor was their bulaklak. NO FLAVOR AT ALL!!!   SERVICE: The little old lady was nice. But service was SLOWWW. It took forever to get our check. Wait! I had to go to the register to pay and they never gave me a check to verify We got all our food. Which they forgot to give me my sisig. But the cashier said she removed it. But still didn't give me the damn check to verify everything. Here's my $106.50, because I'm never coming back here again. Your restaurant might need it more than I do. RIP OFF!  I shouldve gone to Thelma's!"}
{"text":"Okay to start,  came here Sunday afternoon and it was steadily busy with a lot of Filipino people so that is always a good sign.  Wife ordered pork and I got fish and a couple of sides.  We have been here before and taken to go with minimal issues but today.  WHOA BUDDY!! 1) I will compliment the food as the fish even for a Sunday was really fresh and meaty and moist.  Just had to take out the bones but it is what it is.  The pork belly was fine and quite a lot of it as needed a box to take the leftovers home.   2) Service-- Not only EPIC but TOTAL FAIL!!  Walked in and the (host) did not even smile at us but at least offered to let us pick our own table.  Not once even when seated did we get a smile from her.  Maybe having to work on Sunday sucks but we all do that in Las Vegas one way or another.  Multiple times did my wife have to raise her arm up to get attention and she even noticed that the guy in the cooking area tapped a waitress with the impression of *Hey,  they are calling you over*.  The table next to us with a large group had to do the same thing.  She even had to get up once to go get them to give us an extra plate so I had something to put my bones on.  Talk about unfriendly service.  I knew that once I gave my card over to pay,  this was going to take another 20 minutes to get done so I went up front and signed off everything.  I had to actually tell the cashier/hostess \"Excuse me.\" because she was so engrossed in watching the TV that she did not even notice me standing there trying to hand her the check.    Oh,  and did I mention the numerous flies that kept buzzing around our dinner.  I know that sometimes they get in through the front door and that is fine but I counted at least 3 by the window I had to close to try to trap them(pointless but at least better than nothing).  We both agreed that we will be giving this location an indefinite suspension from our list of places to go.  Try the one on the Strip,  At least there the servers walk back and forth and easy to talk with."}
{"text":"Customers beware!!  Service here is sub-par.  Food is decent, but numerous times we've been here....no improvement on service.  Maybe we will have to eat at their other location.  Hopefully, service is better there."}
{"text":"Ordered the Kare Kare my all time favorite dish.  It was delicious but for that price I think they could use ox tail instead of beef."}
{"text":"Since I not a native Filipino-just by blood, I do miss my mom's cooking since I moved out. This place is one that I like- because it is as close home-made as I can taste. Mom's is still better-hehe.   The bulalo and crispy pata are amazing. I had the okoy once, only to be somewhat disappointed that they are regular sized shrimp, not the baby shrimp I always have in PIz but the sweet potato gives is a good new twist.  Place is clean and service is fast. Definitively coming back."}
{"text":"If I can give NO star I absolutely would. I wrote a review on this place about two months ago about their poor service and I won't be coming back..... What do you know, I get a compliment telling me I'm funny, cheap, kiss ass and shame. This is the first time a restaurant basically attacked me for my review. Very unprofessional. Leaving me more bitter. 1) The business reaching out to a person based on their review about their restaurant and talking crap to that person because they reviewed their restaurant with a 1 star.... That shows how unprofessional yalls are. 2) Yelp is a place to write your sincere reviews, and a business goes and basically talks down to the person reviewing? Not cool. 3) Messaging me talking like that just proves you guys have poor service. I now know for sure you're not just affiliated with the business because that IS your business. When someone writes good reviews you compliment them but poor reviews you bash them. Good luck with your business cause you'll need a lot with that kind of work ethic!"}
{"text":"First pinoy food in Vegas since I can't remember when! Usually hit the buffets cause that's what you do when you're in Vegas right. Anyways, flip family craving so, flip food it is.  We called in our order for couple of silogs, their special fried chicken and their binagoongan fried rice for pick up. By the time we got to the place for pick up, it was all ready and waiting for us. The counter cashier/server was very friendly.   Our food taste delicious. My cousin who had the bangsilog complained that the bangus was all head and no meat. The fried chicken taste delicious. The binagoongan was good but a bit on the greasy side.   I wouldn't mind coming back to this place to try their other stuff!"}
{"text":"This place is so good! Better than my moms Filipino food :) great prices, great customer service, and great food!! I loved the pancit and lumpia!"}
{"text":"My first time ever at this restaurant and I loved it! They have a menu full of Filipino foods! The inside is so clean, and the food was amazing. We ordered the pork sisig, pork belly, salmon head sinigang, and garlic rice. The portions of the al a cartes were a lot bigger than I expected, so if you're ordering for yourself don't order too much!!!"}
{"text":"It used to be a good place until they changed the server! Food is not as good too anymore. Really bad. 4/4/17 4:30pm"}
{"text":"I have tried all the filipino restaurant around las vegas and this has to be the best authentic restaurant there is. Besides mom's cooking this came pretty close. I'm always looking for authentic and not fusion, don't ruin a great thing!"}
{"text":"Food is really good. Servers are nice. The gold fishies looks super happy in the aquariums. Lol. They have a good lunch special option. Must try."}
{"text":"Breakast was good. Every time I have eaten here the food has been delicious. Filipina  Longaneza, tapsilog, pork bbq and Sinangang for breakfast today did not disappoint. I highly recommend D'  Pinot Joint."}
{"text":"Crispy pata full of meat not just bones cooked perfectly. Kare Kare creamy yummy goodness. Sinigang taste like my grandmama's if not better. Fish balls are just like back home in PI. Pancit was delicious, the fried banana egg roll Turon was the best I ever had. Love this place. Best Filipino place in town!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Second time here and it's delicious. Close to where I live. Delicious food. Good service, however when my wife and I were ready to leave it seemed like it took forever for someone to get us a box to go and our check.   Overall, I would return and recommend this place to others!"}
{"text":"Have I found a Filipino restaurant that I'm finally excited about?! Shockingly, yes!!  I grew up eating traditional home made Filipino food, so I definitely know what authentic is. Now that I'm older and live no where near my mom or my aunt, I crave the dishes I grew up eating. I'm always hesitant to eat Filipino food at restaurants because it just doesn't taste the same. Surprisingly, my non-Filipino BF was the one who found this joint and took me here. And I'm glad he did.  They have a large menu with pork, seafood, chicken, beef and pancit dishes. They even have the breakfast 'silog plates that Filipinos know about. Here's some of the things we've tried so far:  Lumpiang Shanghai: little fried egg rolls that are a staple to the Filipino culture. Crispy and freshly fried!! 5/5  Tortang talong: grilled eggplant omelette. Just like my mom used to make! A little oily, but it was rich and tasty. 5/5!!!!!!  Crispy Pata: deep fried pigs feet. This is why Filipinos have high blood pressure. It's crispy and full of that fatty flavor that we love. 5/5  Pancit palabok: a little too much sauce for my liking, but still had that good smokey flavor and the little crunchy pieces of chicharron. 3.5/5  Sizzling Pork Sisig: pieces of pork belly and pork mask sautéed with onion, sweet peppers and jalapeños topped with a cracked egg. I usually don't opt for sisig, but this was full of the flavor and the egg added a richer flavor. 4/5  Oxtail Kare Kare: oxtails simmered in peanut sauce with tripe and vegetables. Kare Kare is my favorite dish of all time, so I was a little underwhelmed. It wasn't peanut-ey enough for me. But I liked that they put the vegetables on top so they wouldn't get mushy. 2.5/5  I've been satisfied with what we've tried. This definitely fulfills that Filipino food craving. Can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Visiting from Chicago, I'm always so excited to have filipino food in the west coast, since Chicago lacks that. Don't get me wrong we have great places here but just not enough. Came across this place one night, my dad lives in Vegas so he says \"this is new, lets give it a try!\" So why not? Lets just say this place was great! Food was authentic and delicious! And the prices weren't that bad at all! I think though that they could possibly add a little more to the design of their menu but hey the food and price are what matters most! We ordered kare-kare, lechon kawali, miki-bihon pancit, tortang talong, binagoongan, and crispy pata...they were soooo good! And the melon drink was on point! Loved it and looking forward to coming back here on my next visit...already drooling thinking about it =P"}
{"text":"Ok, so I'm hoping to come back and hopefully food will be better. I know they just opened but it seems unorganized and unprepared.  When you first walk in, the joint really makes you feel like you're in a restaurant in the Philippines. We waited a little bit but then the waitress came over and seated us. They quickly took our drink order and said she would be back to take our order.  The wait time from when you place your order to when you actually receive your food is about 45min or so. Not that this is the waitress' fault or anything. They just opened and are severely understaffed. These girls were trying as hard as possible but with only 2 of them running EVERYTHING, they could only do so much. We were not the only ones who had this issue as some people appeared irritated and were complaining to each other. When the food finally did come out, this is what we thought:  Lumpiang Shanghai: They were over fried and lacked filling. I think we would prefer to have less of them for more filling and flavor.  Seasoning was a little bit low as well.  Crispy Chicken Skins: These weren't all too bad. A good unhealthy treat that came out after our entres did. Same with the lumpiang(we ordered them as appetizers).  Pancit Bihon: They messed up this order for me and gave me a combination of noodles instead. No big deal but it wouldn't have made a difference. I know pancit is supposed to be oily but no flavor on meat or noodles. I had to add salt and siracha in order to taste something,  Combination Plate: This wasn't horrible actually. We got the chicken adobo lechon kawali served with rice. Tasty but the lechon was kinda tough to eat. Too hard actually.  I wanna say that this bad service was only due to the staff being overwhelmed and that if I come back in a couple months or so, they will have figured things out and gotten their flavors in order. Here's to crossing my fingers!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my gf, she's Filipina and I am a complete noob to the cuisine, actually find myself a bit intimidated by it. Bistec.....do it. If you like beef you absolutely will not regret. The service and staff was extremely friendly and attentive and more than willing to accommodate special requests and explain the menu. Ambiance is clean, nice, low key but well lit. I'm confident we will be back."}
{"text":"Did some take out today. I wanted Pork Adobo but I asked what type of pork they use. I did not want \"Fat Adobo\" whereby the type of pork used is a lot of fat or pork belly. That's what they use there so I opted for Chicken Adobo. Pretty good, come with some steamed rice. Cost just under $10 with tax. Portion size could be a little larger given the price. No bones, so that is good. Abiance is nice. I would go back again."}
{"text":"Worst service... Don't expect to even get eye contact if your not philipino or with someone who is philipino... We waited 10 minutes and no joke we weren't brought waters or menus, sad because the food is good."}
{"text":"Delicious!! That's how I have to start off my review. The food was amazing and delicious!! My mom, husband, kids and myself truly enjoyed the food there. Everyone who works there was very attentive, and accommodating. Food came out quickly, did not wait long at all. We ordered Lomi soup. Packed with shrimp chicken and noodles. Fresh lumpia, tasty. Okoy, very light and crispy. Caldareta, so good! And of course Crispy Pata. Fried perfectly. Crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Halo halo for dessert. Big enough for all of us to share. They even have a banquet hall for parties. Very nicely done!! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"when family craves Filipino, this is on top of our list. Generous servings, fresh ingredients, articulate and friendly staff. Happy tummy!"}
{"text":"The meal servings are big. It's good for two to three. The dinuguan is good however it's a little bit oily. I like the lumpiang sariwa esp the peanut sauce. It reminds me of the lumpiang sariwa in the Philippines that you can buy at the carenderias. The fish ball was good. It is not the typical fish ball on the street of the Philippines. It was more of a squid ball rather than a fish ball. I bought colorful puto also, my son said that it tasted like suman. The lechon kawali was okay. It didn't impress or wow me. Overall, it was okay."}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this restaurant and was glad the service and food was really good."}
{"text":"I had this crazy craving for Lechon Kawali for weeks! (Crispy Pork Belly) It didn't help that my coworkers showed me pictures of their home made Lechon and went through how they made it.  My husband and I decided it would be best just to go out and buy it. It was only about $9.99 and wouldn't be worth the trouble for me to cook it since I'm the only one who eats it . I ordered this with a side of vinegar instead of the sauce it normally comes with. I'm so glad they had it because I was so close to bringing my own vinegar dipping sauce. I could tell my husband was scared I was really going to do it  until he convinced me that I should just ask for it. The lechon ..steamed rice and vinegar totally satisfying!   While I was there I figured I would get all of my wants out of the way so I ordered the Shanghai Lumpia (skinny ones) and Pork Adobo . It's nice they include steamed rice with the Adobo and the Lechon . Some places just want to charge for every little thing. The portions are good I had enough to take home to enjoy for two more meals! D' Pinoy Joint is a quick fix for your Filipino cravings that is easy on your wallet!"}
{"text":"I attended a group luncheon with over 60 people there on Sunday February 21, 2016. The food, service and set up for our group was outstanding. The menu was varied, well prepared and served warm buffet style. Our group was seated next door in the area just acquired by the restaurant.  Myself and many from our group will be returning there for lunch and dinner in the future."}
{"text":"The D'Pinoy serving crew & staff were hospitably friendly in welcoming me to their dining establishment. After truckin' all those longhaul miles,it's nice to see friendly people.... The restaurant had some sort of cultural #get2gether with some cool,easy listening live music!! This was a relaxing atmosphere to enjoy eating my #karekare OxTail stew n rice selection! Now...back to the regularly scheduled sunday agenda!"}
{"text":"This was my first time in Vegas and first time eating Filipino food.  First of all, they had a acoustic band playing cover songs which was awesome!  I ordered the combination fried rice, crispy pata and ended it with the halo halo.  The food was excellent and relatively cheap as well.  The portions were also enormous!  This was the best meal I had in Vegas and I will definitely come back here when I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"We ordered the inihaw or grilled Bangus (milk fish ) and it was fresh and delicious. We got also the fresh lumpia bamboo sprouts with peanut sauce and that was good too. The place looks clean and staff were friendly. Price was very affordable for sit in dining Philippine food.   Only negative will be their exhaust system needs to be updated. The place was smokey and we smelled liked bbq after eating. My eyes started to water and the kids were also affected from inhaling the smoke from the kitchen."}
{"text":"We Love this place! The food was excellent! Everything was freshly cooked and seasoned perfectly. Presentation was on point and the servers were attentive and friendly. We had a larger party, so a tip was already included in our bill which I didn't mind one bit since the food and service were a hit!  I'm coming back and I already have my next order ready!  If you're new to this place, make sure you have their Ukoy. Best I've had."}
{"text":"Brought my family here for a brunch. We all ordered silog (tapsilog, tocilog, longsilog). All were delicious served with garlic fried rice and vinegar....yummm! And the price is also very reasonable since they give you big portions! We also ordered pork sinigang, although me myself, I like my sinigang soup really sour. Their sinigang is not too sour for me, but I was okay with it. My family liked it. Vegetables were half cooked too. But its ok, it was still edible.   For dessert, we had the Ube Halaya which was really good, served with macapuno on the side.. We also ordered ginataang bilo bilo. It didn't have a banana! And it was tooo sweet...(in a negative way) lol!  Service was very friendly. We felt like we were just at home. They also have an acoustic band playing. At first, we were like, it's super early for a band to be playing...we wanted a nice, relaxed, quiet time to eat. But when the grandpa started singing, we couldn't help but sing with him as well! Haha. You can request a song to him and he'll sing it. Or if you want, you can get on the stage and sing it yourself while he plays it.   We got there at 11am and nobody was there yet but us. The place started getting busy and packed at 12noon. Good thing we got there a little earlier than everyone else.. =P  All in all, good experience!! will recommend to any family, relatives and friends!"}
{"text":"Dinoguan was excellent and pinakbet was not. I will be back to try other things when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"this was my first time here and this place is probably my new favorite restaurant for Filipino food.  the host family reserved the banquet room for about 35 people and the regular room of the restaurant was filled. the service is what you would expect with a large party. the grilled chicken with bbq sauce was sweet and tasty. the chicken tinola soup had a little zing to it because of the ginger but it was very delicious. the halo halo was large. there are a lot of choices on the menu that you can go for, but my favorite is the chicken with bbq sauce."}
{"text":"I love this place. One of the best Filipino restaurants I have had in a while. Their sinigang is amazing and the service is awesome. I live in Henderson and I hope they open a location there soon :)"}
{"text":"This place served completely blacked out meat. They offered us a 20% discount on that entree alone. Food quality wasn't good for the other meals either. Avoid and go somewhere."}
{"text":"We came here with our kids late Sunday night when we arrived in Vegas. We wanted to have rice after driving for 2 days and tired of eating burgers from McDonalds. My husband had tapsilog and I had ordered tocilog but was served longsilog instead. We ordered our eggs sunnyside but served over medium. Didn't bother to send back our orders as we were famished but was disappointed with our meals. Our son ordered tempura but was disappointed with the hard as a rock batter."}
{"text":"If you are in a big group this is a perfect place to go. The menu is family style. Food is delicious and good customer service. Food is what you would expect but nothing to write home about. If you looking for a good \"home cooked\" Filipino food, look no other. It looks like this is a \"Locals\" joint, which is always a good sign. Rick was very attentive we shall be back."}
{"text":"We went to D'Pinoy Joint on a Saturday morning.  It was relatively busy.  After a chat with the owner she had said that business is doing well and they are looking for a bigger space.  It is a restaurant vs a buffet which I'm so happy to see.  I'm not a big fan of the buffet style Filipino restaurants.  Anyhow we ordered a lot!  I ordered the Longsilog which was more of an individual plate with eggs and rice.  But everything else was family style.  The rest of our order consisted of the following: Beef w/ Bitter Melon, Filipino Fried Chicken, Pansit, Ukoy, & Halo Halo.  Everything was delicious, I really can't say one negative thing about the food.  The highlight was the Halo Halo.  It's a must have.  According to the waitress the ingredients of the Halo Halo are all home made and not from cans.  The food came out fast the the staff was very hospitable.  I'd say the only thing that was lacking was the attention to the table.  After we got all our food we didn't get a refill on our waters and it was a little hard to get the attention from the staff to move on to next steps (ie: desert, check).  However the food and ambiance overshadowed any lack of attention we had!  I'd give this a 4.5 of 5.  But in this case I'll round up :)"}
{"text":"The food is too oily .. they have halo halo but then with garbanzo beans that sounds weird .. eh overall 3 star is good enough for this place"}
{"text":"The fiance and I came since we were in the area and I've been meaning to try this place out for two reasons - I rarely eat Filipino food at restaurants despite being Filipino and been craving some and also wanted to find a solid spot that does some catering. Ordered 3 items I was interested in ordering for catering to share.   Pork Tonkatsu - basically lechon kawali like...yet there is also lechon kawali on the menu so I wonder what the difference is. Either way, the pork was tender and had pretty crispy, but not too crisp it's hard, skin. Very solid stuff.   Miki Bihon was very close to how I would make it at home. Good flavor and very generous portion that didn't skimp on meat and veggies so every bite had a bit of everything.   Lumpia shanghai was pretty decent. They were about 2 bite sized and came with a dozen in a order. Very crispy, hot and not greasy.   The place had a steady flow of customers and was pleased that things came out pretty fast, fresh and hot. Filipino cuisine isn't really the best known for speed and tend to be slow service typically. The server we had was a younger guy and he was friendly and checked on us pretty well.   I'm not normally one to be really into a Filipino place, but not only was it good, I think what made is slightly better was their style of cooking seems closest to what I'm used to (my mom is from the Quezon region) than any other place I've had so far. I appreciate all regions, but theres something more satisfying when it's closer to Lola/Nanay cooking. Filipino food is one of my fiances least favorite Asian foods to eat out only because he hasn't had very many good ones, but he really liked this too.   We will be coming back soon and if it's consistent to boot then it may be the only Filipino place I'll be going to on a regular. I think I will be hitting them up for catering trays."}
{"text":"Quick service, typical filipino joint. Came here expecting something a little better food than those of quick fast food. Since it was a dine in restaurant I thought quality of food would surprise me, but did not. We ordered the kare-kare and sizzling sisig bangus. Both dishes were just alright, nothing to exceed your taste buds."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to some good Filipino hospitality when we decided to come to this restaurant. Upon entering, there's a sign at the entrance saying please wait to be seated. Host was on the phone while seating us, sat us at a booth and then asked how many in our party realizing we wouldn't fit in a 4 person booth. At our table, host gave us 3 menus, even after knowing there were 5 of us there. Order was placed food was good. One of our entree orders never made it to our table. Idk if they forgot to put the order in but we jut decided to forget about it. No refills were offered. Did not get charged for our missing entree which was good. Husband and kids really wanted halo halo, but with the service we got we just said screw it paid our bill and left. We will not be coming back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"My Kare Kare Craving. I have been craving for kare kare for a month. Frustrated each time I go to other filipino places either the content is pork instead of oxtail/beef. Who makes kare kare with pork?  I found this place on yelp D'Pinoy on flamingo. Very happy with the outcome and its more than enough for the price. Its worth the money and trip. I would pay extra for good kare kare. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"A decent Filipino restaurant that accommodates large parties well. We celebrated my aunts birthday here and made reservations. We were advised to place our orders 2 hours in advance (via telephone) for our party of 10.  When we were seated at our reservation time, we didn't have to wait long for food. It was fresh and served at a good temperature.  We ordered a lot of food, including: pancit, pancit palabok, lechon kawali, BBQ sticks, Kare Kare, binagoongan crispy pata with eggplant, and pinakbet. All tasted fine, but of course I've had better versions elsewhere. The stand out dish was the binagoongan crispy pata with eggplant. It is a deep fried pork leg that is super crispy and fatty. The sauce is really tasty, it is bagoong, a salty shrimp paste. Definitely, not your typical everyday Filipino cuisine. This cholesterol, sodium filled dish is best saved for special occasions.  I was most excited for their halo halo after I saw photogenic photos of it on social media. I was disappointed in overall flavor and presentation. I've had better with various versions of halo halo within Seafood City.  Overall observation, many diners there were part of tables 6+ and even there is a separate room for overflow/party use. The service is pretty good too.   *****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge***** 50/100"}
{"text":"Fucking bad customer service! Our server was a stuck up biatch!!!! This will be our first and last visit here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is in a older building but it's definitely CLEAN! The tables are not sticky or have a residue from any towels. Food presentation was very nice and the size of the portions I would say is good enough for 2 people. The Kara Kara was on point, the Kaldereta I prefer a lot of sauce but it was still good and the beef was really tender and the BBQ stick was a little hard for my taste but still good. Not really sure if the food was made fresh because it did come out fast as soon as we ordered but still in the end I enjoyed the food and wanted more."}
{"text":"Items Selected: Lumpaing Shanghai - Ground Pork and Peas wrapped in Eggroll Wrapper and Deep Fried with Sweet & Sour Sauce Fish Balls - Deep Fried Fish Balls with Sweet & Sour Sauce  Tortang Talong - Eggplant Omelet Mongo Guisado - Mung Bean Cooked in Bittermelon and Bokchoy with fried Pork Belly and Shrimp Binagoongan Crispy Pata with Eggplant - Deep Fried Pork Trotters and Knuckles with fried Eggplant, Jalapenos, Shrimp Paste, Lechon Brown Sauce, Soy Sizzling Pork Sisig - Grilled Pork Cheek and Deep Fried Pork Belly Sauteed in Onion, Bell Peppers, Jalapeno Sizzling Bistek - Thinly Sliced Beef Chuck Roll cooked in Soy Sauce and Lemon Juice topped with Fried Onion on a Sizzling Plate Oxtail Kare-Kare - Beef Oxtail and Tripe cooked in Creamy Peanut Sauce with Veggies and Shrimp Paste Garlic Rice Rice Halo Halo - Sweet Potato, Banana, Sweet Beans, Jackfruit, Ube Halaya, Red and Green Gulaman, Leche Flan, Ube Ice Cream, Cream, Pinipig Mais Con Yelo - Creamy Style Corn, Corn and Mais Queso Ice Cream Puto Bumbong - Ube Steamed Glutinous Rice topped with Coconut Flakes, Sugar, Sesame Seeds   Surprisingly unknown to two Filipino friends and one Chef who fancies the cuisine, while another alternatively touted the restaurant at 6820 West Flamingo Road as one of the best in town, it was with five friends and their children that a long table was filled in D'Pinoy Joint at noon on Saturday, the experience both hit and miss as relates to everything from the environment to service and food.  Owned by immigrants to a city known for one of the most rapidly growing Filipino populations in the United States, their goal to serve authentic tastes of native cuisine to those familiar and first-timers alike, D'Pinoy Joint features a sizable menu chock-a-block filled with Pork and other meaty options, most portions appropriate for sharing with a banquet space offered for those hosting parties up to sixty or more next door.  Oddly decorated to say the least, half of the restaurant featuring scenes of daily life or traditional dance in the Philippines while the rest is a mish-mash of aquarium fish, motivational posters and spiritual things, it was several minutes after seating that service was eventually flagged down for ordering, a total of twelve menu items selected and delivered with what must have been at least six cups of rice.  Certainly not fine dining, plates dropped off without descriptions and water glasses more frequently empty than not, lunch began with a duo of appetizers appropriately delivered before several larger options, the crispy Lumpaing and spongy Fish Balls each served scalding hot from the fryer with sidecars of Sweet & Sour Sauce, both readily sharable amongst the group though neither were anything different from what might be found at any local Dim Sum spot.  Making the mistake of adding un-fried $5.99 Garlic Rice to the complimentary mounds of white stuff, the only difference a shake of dehydrated powder and a teaspoon of toasted Cloves, larger plates began to arrive fast and furious just as appetizers were finished,  the Tortang Talong far more flaccid than one might expect with a substantial coat of oil while the Eggplant served beneath a hunk of deep fried Pork Hock was substantially more delicious amidst thinly sliced Jalapenos and a thick smear of funky Shrimp Paste.  A bit surprised at how flavorless the Mongo Guisado was, particularly as the smell was particularly off-putting to more than one at the table, far better bites were found in the Sizzling Pork Sisig and plate of thinly sliced Beef Chuck, each emitting an aromatic plume of steam on arrival while the Kare-Kare was easily the best plate on the table with bone-in bits of Oxtail juxtaposing soft Beef Stomach in a Creamy Peanut Sauce.  Ready to drop a bill without suggesting dessert, the wait staff seemingly ready to be rid of patrons at 1:30pm even though the room was less than 1/6 full, it was with Ube Halaya \"sold out,\" or not yet delivered, that three alternatives were selected, the Halo-Halo a typically bizarre mash-up of crushed Ice, Fruit and starches while the Mais Con Yelo and Puto Bumbong were far more attention-grabbing, the former essentially a Cream Corn Sundae served as a Shake while the latter was something like Taffy in its texture beneath the sweet/savory juxtaposition of Coconut, Granulated Sugar and toasted Sesame Seeds.  Overlooking the somewhat-expected service issues and décor that seems oddly out-of-place, D'Pinoy Joint offers a good look at Filipino cooking in an environment built for sharing, the majority of the food quite good and said by respected sources to be relatively authentic to the Island's traditional cuisine."}
{"text":"Service and food are satisfactory but what I noticed is that they need to scrub their plates and silverware better."}
{"text":"Couple of times i've  been to this place. First and second time I really like it... Serving was pretty good and the food was very tasty. So, I decided to bring my friends - I was disappointed, tonkatsu was very greasy, serving is small and the food isn't good anymore :(. Took awhile before they take our orders...  Then, I tried them again, ordered to go food, I ordered sinigang and pansit- I was very  disappointed not only the serving is small :( sinigang has no taste and its all vegetables. Hope next time, i'll have a good experience...."}
{"text":"Filipino food isn't the healthiest thing you could eat but is it good? Yes! I'm half-Filipino so, I think I have the right to be a Filipino food snob. My mom, lola (grandma), and my titas (aunties by blood or my mom's friends) were all cooking machines with an arsenal of fresh ingredients, serving Pinoy dishes at the rate of 5 dishes per minute. Their main goal in life is to feed everyone...all the time! We have family in Manila that frown upon karaoke which is why you won't hear me on the Magic Mic - not that you would want to anyway! LOL.  If I'll have heart disease/ diabetes (which are common among Filipinos), it better be worth it. They have lechon kawali, crispy pata, kare-kare, lumpia, lumpiang Shanghai, garlic rice, adobo, halo-halo, different kinds of pancit, laing, toci/tapsi/longsi-log, etc. People have complained about the lack of circulation and the heat in this place - something I cannot relate to since my family gets me food to-go for me.   Lechon Kawali: Fried pork belly. It's a bit confusing how they have \"tonkatsu (fried pork belly)\" on their menu - this might have been a lost in translation moment. The skin is crisp and simply delicious. I didn't like the sauce it came with which I think is made in house. I prefer Mang Tomas. 3.5/5  Lumpiang Shanghai: Fried egg roll with meat and veggies. This is one of the Filipino party staples. You dip  it in sweet and sour sauce and hear the crunch as you chomp on lumpia. Their version is not greasy at all which is an absolutely good thing. 4.5/5  Chicken Adobo: I can only eat my mom's adobo. She's the only one who makes it the way I like it. People get butthurt when I don't like their version but oh, well... We ordered this for my friend who does not eat pork. However, they gave us pork adobo. My friend was left hangry and bad times were had by all. 1/5"}
{"text":"This place is meant for big parties and families.  There is a $15 minimum for credit card and debit cards. The food was okay, I was a party of one and I was mostly ignored the whole time. The waitress gave me two waters and never checked up on me after the food arrived. I ordered a melon juice but did not received it until my meal arrived and my dessert arrive with in two minutes of receiving my entree. The food has given my a stomachache all night. I don't give poor reviews but I was not impress by the food or the service that I have gotten tonight."}
{"text":"Very nice little sit-down Filipino restaurant. The place inside was comforting; very nice and home-y. There are tables and booths for seating as well as seating by the door and at the \"bar\" which also acts as their register/waiter area.  The food was pretty good, too. The presentation of the food is what made it even more appetizing. It reminded me of my Tita's cooking every time we would have a potluck. I had the sizzling bistek and the kare-kare.  The bistek was so good. It was perfectly marinated (but could use a little kalamansi) and had the perfect tenderness to it. It's the perfect pairing with the caramelized onions and steamed rice. The kare-kare was cooked perfectly, too. The meat was so tender and slid off the bone with the tripe not being too rubbery, and the gulay (veggies) had the perfect crunch and green color to it, so I know it's fresh and not overcooked. It also had the creamy peanut-buttery taste to it, just like a classic kare-kare dish should have.   I will come again with friends so they could try the flavors of the Filipino culture!"}
{"text":"Great Filipino food, great service! The adobo, pancit, lumpia, and fried rice were all so flavorful! The next time I am in Vegas, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I didn't dine in, but my family and I ordered food to go! I'm only going to write my review about 2 of their dishes that we ordered because they were the only ones I remembered. Lol.  It was the Kare Kare and Sisig!! Omg they were so delicious. Now, I firmly believe that there is no Kare Kare that trumps my mom's Kare Kare, but this is a close one!! I could tell that they actually put peanut butter in their Kare Kare which makes it taste more authentic. In other filipino restaurants, it just tastes so bland.  The Sisig was so good too! Not too fatty and not too spicy. Just the way I like it."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Lonsilog, pancit and lumpia!"}
{"text":"Just like aunties used to make.   Whenever I come here for lunch I'm always prepared to wait a while for the food as its a sit down restaurant and not buffet style. But the quality makes up for the wait. Always order the beef sinigang. The portions are large and I always have some to take home ;) #yumyum"}
{"text":"I am rating this place based on their food because the place was decent and the staff was super nice. We had the pancit palabok which was disappointing because it was sooo bland, we ordered it to go so i didnt have any fish sauce to sprinkle  to add saltiness to it, i was so bummed! The pork sinigang was good there was a lot of meat and the sourness was just right.  The shanghai was just okay nothing that I would rave about. The biggest offense was the cassava cake it was hard as a rock, and nothing like the cassava cake taste that i am familiar with, i felt i was ripped off buying that, the whole thing went straight to trash. Buy at your own risk with their rice cakes."}
{"text":"Was looking for good filipino sit-down style food that was open at 9:30am and saw this new place which wasn't too far.   We had a good experience. Pancit Canton was really tasty, sisig was great, lumpiang shanghai was very well done too. Bicol express was pretty good as well.   Service was good. Our food arrived after about 10-15 minutes and it was hot and freshly done."}
{"text":"Today is like 105 degrees outside. Came here to have lunch and to check it out, only to conclude I will NEVER come here again. Because of the heat, I brought into this establishment some items I bought earlier today (unopened bottled drink, can of drink, and cream cheese on bagel). We had no intention of eating or drinking it here just did not want to leave it in the heat out in the car. I guess if I stuffed it in my purse or bag they would not make it a point of coming to our table to charge us for bringing it into their restaurant even if we did not open it or drink it. They told us they would charge 0.50 each for the items we brought in even though we did not open any of it. We were surprised but accepted the fee. My son later asked for a cup of ice and at first they refused then later return with the ice in a soup bowl?  Seriously?? Poor customer service and greed at its best. Never mind that we purchased a large meal for three, they still needed to profit off a bottle of unopened coke I purchased earlier from a gas station. Your service sucked and your food was NOT worth it. Left a bad taste and bad first impression! It's a good thing you can't search our bags cause you'd probably charge me for the gum or candy and bottled water in there too. ZERO hospitality. Maybe it would've been different if I was Filipino? If in Vegas, recommend you try another Filipino restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing food amazing staff. Top notch all around. I always order to go and they treat me just as equal as a walk in. Love it here. Definitely a must try pinoy joint"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go for Filipino food. The food is delicious and the prices are very fair for what you get. The bistek and the caldareta are my go to dishes here. The Halo-Halo, banana turon and the buko pandang are AMAZING. Has not been disappointing in the last few times I've gone :)"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT intro to Filipino food! Great food and very friendly environment . Definitely will be going back, so much more food I need to try :-)"}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER! Went this morning for breakfast. Ordered our food right away since we already know what we wanted. I ordered coffee which indicated on the menu free refill. We got our food and proceeded to eat. Then we saw the staff started eating too , I guess they eat  before the rush hour starts. Mind you we were the only one eating in the restaurant. The old lady who took our order never even once check on us, to see if I need more coffee/ water or if we are done eating. There are two guys on the counter just minding their own business without even thinking on checking us too. My husband even had to go to the counter to asked for our bill. I would give them O star for this. While all the staff are still busy eating. This is why I don't like going to any Filipino restaurant, customer service sucks! When I complained to the guy who gave us our bill, I felt no sincere apology coming from him. Never again will I'll set foot at this place. Sorry that I even recommended your restaurant to my out of towner friends and never will I do that again."}
{"text":"Horrible service and the food was dry and bland. Oxtail curry was bland siningang was alright sizzling steak DRY. I wasnt impressed at all.  The servers were so annoying asking every 2 min what we wanted to order then after we got our food didn't care to check on us. My husband had to flag down a server just to get our check. Although the halo Halo did look good the service was so Bad I just wanted out."}
{"text":"This joint has replaced the Thai BBQ restaurant that I used to visit which was really good. I decided to stop by one day and check it out with a take out order on the way to work. I waited what seemed like an eternity for my appetizer to be prepared.  While I sat waiting for my take out order, I began to sweat my tits off! No air circulation, just a fan blowing hot musty air around. That was a turn off and I will never expose myself to that again. Thank the devil I was just in for a to go order, I would have to of left early during a dining session.   My lumpia left a lot to be desired, very disappointing to say the least. There were 10 bite sized pieces that set me back $8. I was already frustrated at the long wait, the sitting in a sauna experience and now my appetizer let me down! I ordered the shanghai lumpia which was all wrapper no filling except a couple of peas in it?    I may be a German girl but I make Lumpia at home and it is the bomb bud!  I got bent over in this visit, but never again!"}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed. I personally felt that the food was lacking flavor. However, my hubby seemed to enjoy it, so that's good:)"}
{"text":"Waiter was nice. Food was okay. We decided to have breakfast items. Tocino was not sweet. Longanisa was ok."}
{"text":"Delicious first taste of Philippine food. The wife and I shared the lunch special: 2 generously-portioned items for $8.49. We got the Lechon Kawali (Deep Fried Pork Belly) and Chicken Adobo. The pork belly was amazing. The outside was super crispy but so tender on the inside. I knew I was overeating but just couldn't stop. The chicken was also very flavorful.  For dessert we shared a Turon, which came with a scoop of ice cream. Incredible! Can't believe I never knew about this!"}
{"text":"Always on the lookout for for good grub to enjoy with fitness, we found ourselves at D Pinoy Joint last Saturday for lunch.   We ordered a number of classic dishes and many were hits and many weren't. Some of the highlights were the fried pork belly and eggplant, corn dessert and the kare kare. The rest was forgettable but I'd be interested to check out the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"Heard about this new restaurant so I brought my family to check this out. We always eat out and have tried different kinds of foods already so we are very particular in service, accommodation and ambiance. First, the service is kinda slow. And they don't check up on you if you need anything else. The table is very small so if you order more than 4 items it's too crowded already plus your soda and water. The presentation is decent and I like the guy serenading while you eat. The noodles we ordered (pancit/canton) combination wasn't that enticing because there was almost no meat at all, just the noodles and vegetables. The rest of the food we ordered were ok especially the pork tonkatsu. Overall not too bad and if they improve more then I wouldn't be surprise if people continue to go back there."}
{"text":"I am the worst Filipino ever. If you ask me what kinds of Filipino food I eat its - pancit, lumpia, longoniza, fried silit and adobo. Thats it. I won't stray from my list. If I can't say I won't eat it. Again, worst Filipino ever.   Until this place. My dad made a list of what he wanted, A LIST. With all the Filipino restaurants we've been to - here and back home (in Hawaii) - he has never presented a list. He orders one dish and that's it. But this time around, his list which consisted of 5 items but they only had 4 of them - Bulalo, Lechon Kawaili, Dinuguan, Pinaputok N Pampano. I ordered Longoniza and Garlic Fried Rice which they are known for and my mom got the Pinapaitan. I ate most of my dad's dishes. The Bulalo, Lechon and Pinaputok N Pampano was so delicious. My daughter even got into the Pampano. Most of his dishes were gone by the end of the meal.   The service is was not as ravishing as the food. A older lady took our order and missed my garlic fried rice. My mom kept asking her if the Pinapaitan had shrimp and she replied it did but did not disclose that it can be made without it. Another employee who came to take our drink order had to inform my mom that they can make it without the shrimp. Then after they dropped all the food, no one came to check on us. At the end, we had to go up to the counter to ask for take out containers AND the check, while the workers stood at the counter, eating and talking. I'd definitely order here again for the food but probably take it to go."}
{"text":"When we came back everything's perfect except for the server. But the server doesn't stop me for coming back. More \"D Pinoy Joint\" for me!"}
