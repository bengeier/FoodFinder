{"text":"Says what it does on the box! If a Smokey, heavy, tasty and fully loaded traditional BBQ is what you crave then this is the place. Very welcoming staff, great food.  If I were a bigger BBQ fan in general this would be a 5 star review for sure."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the average rating here. I love this place. The back patio is awesome. The El Hefe sandwich is absolutely outstanding. It's a touch pricey (that sandwich is $17 without a side for example) but it does take a lot of work to make BBQ."}
{"text":"This place is great! The brisket was delicious as were the ribs. We found that the service was attentive and they were very accommodating to me when we went with my infant daughter. We have been back twice since then and haven't been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ordered ribs and they were out of it (they phoned me 30 minutes later to tell me they just ran out), they didn t accomodate me (i ordered a \"make your own\" at 30$ and ask if no ribs, just deduct them from the bill but they refused) Order arrived cold and portions were so small!! Incredible! Never again. The 30$ option was 4 chicken wings, 4 slices of beef brisket, 1 chicken leg. Also ordered a ceasar, that was ok but really really small for the price."}
{"text":"Sit on the Dam Patio... Feels like a cabin in the woods. Make sure try as many sides as possible. The Chili Verde was delicious! Portions are huge so for the price you can take 1/2 home and enjoy the next day! Also, Friday night drink specials of $5 pints of Amsterdam Brews!!!!!!! Try everything!!!! Even the Caesar salad was amazing."}
{"text":"I have celiacs and was impressed by how knowledgeable the staff was. Taurean was our server and he was awesome! I said I have celiacs and he said that all of the rubs and sauces were all gluten free but the deep fryer was not seperate so anything deep fried there would be cross contamination. I had the St Louis ribs and Caesar salad (no croutons) and my meal was delicious! My husband had the grilled cheese and side pork poutine. Big portions, great prices and amazing flavour!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  I have heard of these guys but have never tried before.  I tried their food truck at the CNE this year and was NOT disappointed!  Food truck and events are always a little pricey in my opinion but the $14 price tag for the Tony Montana sandwich was well worth it, and I almost never say that about CNE food.  If you go to their truck or restaurant please give this sandwich a go.  And their hot sauce was delicious!  To cap it all off, the vendors were friendly and there was a young lad (possibly the truck owner's son) who was well beyond his age in his professionalism, attention and his personality.  While waiting for our food we were all talking about how great he was.  Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal here. Didn't find it overpriced - it's in line with similar restaurants in Toronto. We loved the extra sauces that came with our meal. Ordered with the help of a friendly server and had a perfect amount of food."}
{"text":"This past weekend my better half and I decided to try Hogtown Smoke in the East End.  We LOVE BBQ! And Love (even more) smoked meats.   We had read quite a few reviews on this place and were really excited to try the good eats. I called in my order - asked for take-away. The gal on the phone was super polite and friendly. All good! Drove to the beach to get my food - reasonable turn-around time - about 20 mins from order to pick up. All good!  Arrived at the BBQ joint - went inside. It's cozy - wood benches; chalk board signs; barn board wood. It's comfortable and busy - even for a Sunday.  I would be more inclined to dine in there say on a Monday or Tuesday - less of a rushed feeling (not from the servers but from the customers waiting to get in).  Picked up my take-away. I ordered the  Wilbur (for 3-4 ppl). My Guy eats a lot of protein and this way, we were planning on having left-overs for the following day.  While we did have meaty left-overs (and the smoked meats/BBQ were delicious)..... sadly, the portions of the sides were an absolute JOKE.  You get 3 sides with the Wilbur ($68 + Tax).  And apparently, the sides-portions are really just garnish. I ordered the 2 Slaws - Creamy Slaw & Purple Slaw and also the Corn Bread. For 3-4 people, you get approximately 1 cup of slaw (purple and creamy each) and literally 1 corn bread muffin!!!!! And I am not talking even an unreasonably huge muffin (think Tim Horton's sized muffin). I am saying - like a muffin bottom!!!! For 3-4 people.  What a JOKE!  So, for about $70, I got meat. Which is fine - but I'd appreciate if the restaurant would let their patron's know, the sides are really just garnish and you should be prepared to order at least 3 more sides per person, if they want a meal (about an additional $15 per person). So your $70 meal is now over $100!  And no drinks/cocktails are on that tab.    I am disappointed. Will I eat there/get take away from there again? Most likely not. I hate getting hosed out of my money - especially when it comes to food. I am more than happy to pay for a quality product - I purchase a naturally raised cow every year from Grass Roots Beef in Owen Sound. Happy to spend a couple thousand on that - but at least that's meat for the year......  Thanks anyhow, Hogtown."}
{"text":"Nice, but overpriced.  We have enjoyed going to Hogtown Smoke sine they opened. We especially enjoyed their sampler platters -- a great way to enjoy their great food at a fairly reasonable price for the family (Wilbur fed three with plenty to spare).  Sadly, their menu has changed and they are now charging $30 per person for a two-meat sampler. I am sorry, but we are lucky enough to have another smokehouse in the 'hood that is able to satisfy our meat cravings and provide a great atmosphere for a much more reasonable price.  Thanks for pushing us in the right direction."}
{"text":"So happy to have this place in The Beach which is better known for quantity of restaurants than quality.  This place rocks the BBQ with great tasting meats; particularly the brisket.  Ample portions mean we always have leftovers to take home.  Only downsides I can think of are the sides.  Beans, slaw and cornbread are certainly tasty but generally pretty small portions.  Also, the place is so popular that wait times for tables and food can be long but slide up to the bar, carve out a space and have a drink.  Or get the takeout and enjoy it at home.  Arrive early as they sometimes run out of certain foods on busy nights.  Can't wait for summertime when the patio opens!"}
{"text":"Maybe all of the locals need to calm down a bit . I'm not a regular nor a local and have never eaten here before . The service was friendly (on the patio) and the food was delicious . Yum , hit my cravings for smoked eats ."}
{"text":"Just upgraded the review to 3 stars.  It's good if you want smoked meat, I like the atmosphere better here than Woodfire (the other smokehouse in the beach), but the food better at Woodfire.  So if going for some beers with friends, I'd say Hogtown."}
{"text":"The only down side to Hog town is its limited size!  Makes getting a seat challenging at times.    Having enjoyed two meals here I have to say, I've not been let down yet.  The meat sampler is simply the best way to start your love affairs with Hog Town.  After that delicious meal you'll understand the care and flavors they've worked into all their menu items.  I recently hand the pulled pork Grilled Cheese, and I must say it was a filling  meal for two just about!  The sandwich was piled high with pork and cheese.  The plate full of fries, & my selection of a bean side piping hot!   For a good meal anytime, especially winter!  You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on the weekend, which is a good time to go as it's not crowded.  Had the brisket sandwich and a local organic beer.  The sandwich was very generous however I had to remove a large piece of fat from one slice.  Sauce selection on the table was good.  The red cabbage slaw could have used a bit more vinegar.  Baked beans side was far too fatty which took away the root beer flavor.  As someone who travels to Texas a lot for business I can say that Hogtown Smoke BBQ is authentic, however Toronto prices are always a bummer."}
{"text":"Went there middle of the day Sunday in August.  Patio was mostly full.  Inside was mostly empty.  No lineup.  I asked for table for 4.  The staff told me that they were closing for about 45min because the kitchen got \"slammed.\"  I said what about just drinks? They said no they arent letting anyone else in right now.  Ive never experienced that before - closing at peak time due to....being kinda busy? Anyway we live around the corner, the food here is OK but the service is generally poor.  We wont be coming back.  Thats how bad service loses 1000's of dollars. Very disappointing.   Sept 2015 Update: restaurant was featured on a \"do not go\" list due to crucial safety infractions regarding cleanliness.  A ghetto cardboard \"help wanted\" sign hangs in front window now."}
{"text":"I'm only giving 4 stars because there's no mac and cheese on the sides menu.   Really great. Sauces were great. Pork was terrific (I got an amazing black piece in my sandwich), cornbread muffin was really good. Beans had a bit too much meat in them for my liking (I don't love fatty pieces in my beans, but that's just me). Prices weren't crazy and the portions are perfect.  I'd totally bring friends here."}
{"text":"I wish I actually got to eat here. Unfortunately, I had a terrible experience. Last night (on a Sunday), my friend and I entered the restaurant. It was pretty busy but had a booth and a small table still open. We were greeted by a man who was behind the bar who asked if we were on the wait list. We replied no and he said it was fine and that would could sit in the booth.  My friend and I still had our coats on when a waitress came up abruptly and asked if we were on the wait list. We then filled her in - no we were not on the list, but we were prompted to sit by another employee. She told us that our booth was just reserved over the phone and that she was confused and didn't know what to do. It was obvious she wanted us to leave. We just sat there awkwardly and then told her we would leave.  It was extremely awkward for not only us - but the other customers.   I hope to actually try their food next time!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I (a man who can eat a lot) went to Hogtown on Mother's Day and ordered the two person platter which includes four meats and three sides.  We had pulled pork, brisket, chicken, and back ribs. The food was fantastic and portions were so vast we had to take the last bit home. The chicken was huge and probably the juiciest I've ever had. The sauces come on the side which is excellent as some people just like the meat and not overloaded with sauce.  The cornbread was the best I've ever had and it came with what they called bourbon butter which is whipped nicely. The creamy slaw was good and the sweet potato fries and dipping sauce were a very nice addition to the show.  Now the prices are expensive, particularly the $8 pint of Beau's which is way too expensive for a local beer.  As someone who has been to more than my fair share of bbq joints in this city and in the American south, I would definitely recommend this place and so would my girl."}
{"text":"If you order Pinot Grigio at a BBQ joint you should probably lose your Yelp privileges....   Great interior, friendly service, Beau's on tap and beautiful meat. Given the sheer dearth of options in my home neighborhood of the Beaches I was tempted to go five but on the sauce and sides they don't quite match up to a couple of other places in Toronto (Stockyards - most notably.)  Regardless - I will go back - Often."}
{"text":"We've eaten here three times.  Two times, the food was great but the service was terrible.  Once, the service was great but the food was... okay. When the food is good, the meat melts and the fatty bits are gloriously caramelized.  And you can mostly forget that the service is so bad and the prices absurdly high.   That's why we came back that third time.   But when the meat is dry and chewy, suddenly it's complete madness that about 4 ounces of burnt ends are $18, as is a modestly-sized brisket sandwich. There was serious sticker shock.   If the food was always up to the initial standards, they improved the service, and brought the prices into line, I'd be there weekly.   Two of those three, and probably monthly.  As it is, I don't think we'll be heading back."}
{"text":"Great barbecue, really nice staff but the prices are crazy!   It's over $30 on average for a meal without a drink. Too much money for barbecue when the ingredients aren't high-end."}
{"text":"Will not return - the service was ok but the ribs were dry and cold. The restaurant is very hot inside. The patio is nice but not very clean. Positive note: barbecue sauces are good"}
{"text":"I've been three times, and picked up food once to take to the beach. Each time has been great, although I didn't discover the back patio until today... highly recommend it. Ribs are good, beef brisket is great. But also just a good environment for a BBQ place, not sterile and modern like some other places I've seen. Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Probably the best BBQ I've had in the city and imo this place is better than some of the BBQ joints that have been around for a while. Had to sign up for yelp and give them props! Definite competition. The (pork) ribs were my favourite, but get one of the platters and share. The meat doesn't come smothered in sauce, which is a testament to how great it tastes au natural. Good house made sauces on the side."}
{"text":"Everyone raves about this restaurant. I don't get it personally.  The food was good, not great, and the service was brutal. We were stuck there for an hour and a half, between waiting to be served, waiting for our food, waiting for the bill, it was terrible. They were also blasting the music way too loud. I ordered the Carolina Pulled Pork, it was middle of the road IMO. I did like the restaurant's vibe, it was small, but had a lot of personality and cool wall hangings. I think there's a patio, but I recall them telling us it was full and we couldn't eat in the back, so we were stuck in the front, which isn't as exciting. I also found this restaurant to be very pricey. A full rack of ribs is $49 plus their sharable platters are around the same price for an entree ... I found the portion sizes of the shared plates to be too big for an appetizer but too small for a meal. Like french fries for 2 are $19 - that seems outrageous to me.  Happy I tried it, but I wouldn't eat there again."}
{"text":"Here's the thing. When this place is at it's best, it is 5 stars plus. It can sometimes be inconsistent, though. Sometimes the brisket is heaven on earth, and worth every penny-- but occasionally it doesn't have the flavour, and is a little too fatty. The fries are great-- but then the sweet potato fries are often over-cooked and black. I  would say 75% of the time it's great... And definitely worth a try.  Hint: you can buy house made strip bacon from them. Perfect for Sunday morning brunch at home!"}
{"text":"Came all the way here from Vancouver because my son saw this restaurant on You Gotta Eat Here.  He loves the jack'd up grilled cheese and the other burgers ... el' jeser - come to Jesus & Tony Montana were great too"}
{"text":"Sorry folks. We walked in. All the tables were full. We waited 5 minutes or so and no one spoke to us. Would have loved to have tried this, but there are too many great places in Toronto that don't ignore people. They got one thing right... Their blackboard says they don't know how to run a restaurant!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch with a coworker on a Saturday.  The place was packed and smelled amazing. I didn't mind the wait for our food (take out) until my first bite of the beef brisket on a bun. Dried out brisket with a little tiny container with some bbq sauce in it. Best thing we ate were the corn bread muffins. Just shy of 40 bucks for two sandwiches with sides and no drinks. Wouldn't give it another shot at that price point."}
{"text":"The \"Burnt Ends\" are the best. Only available on certain days so make sure you call ahead. Great place to hang out with family and friends. Limited seating, but not often a wait to get in. Great atmosphere. Plan on going there for my birthday."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and has the best brisket sandwich I have ever had. Good food and prices equals a winner for me.  Can't wait to go back and try the grilled cheese brisket sandwich and ribs"}
{"text":"Ate here many times and can honestly say, it's amazing. The hog heaven sandwich with pulled pork and jalapeño sausage is to die for."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying I REALLY wanted this place to be awesome.  It's slim pickings in the Beaches when it comes to eating out.  Plus I love BBQ.  However...  Arrived early (5:30) because it was raining and I didn't feel like waiting outside.  There were about two tables left at that time.  Our waitress gave us the impression that she did not like us, which is weird because we just sat down and we would be tipping her later.  When my husband asked about their bourbon cocktails, she replied, \"Yeah we have a lot,\" not offering any options.  Additionally, some of the staff were taking shots at the bar, which isn't really cool.  I liked the decor, especially the bucket lamps and wooden tables. The big menu wall was also cool.  I appreciated that they had a space where they updated what foods they ran out of.   A negative is the set-up of the restaurant.  You can't wait at the front because there is no space, so people crowd around your table through the restaurant, standing right in front of your plate, looking down at you while you eat... And there is a long wait.  I witnessed people being seated before others who had been their earlier, as well as tables remaining empty, despite the restaurant being packed with standing people, waiting.  The food.  It was okay.  The sauces are fine, but they don't offer just a regular, run of the mill BBQ sauce.  The \"variety\" of sauces all taste very similar and they are thin, spicy, and not sweet. The other problem with their sauces is that they don't apply the sauces in the kitchen.  You do it yourself at your table.  So your chicken wings, pulled pork and brisket show up sauceless.  Unless you go through your pulled pork, layer by layer to apply sauce, it's not going to be like a regular pulled pork sandwich.  The sides were okay (I had creamy coleslaw and cornbread).    The music was also a problem.  It was way too loud and it alternated between recent country and 80's hair metal rock.  Additionally,  their wifi, which they advertise on their chalk wall, wasn't working.  I really want to go back and have an amazing BBQ place in the Beach, but I won't be back for a long while.  I hope some changes are made."}
{"text":"Holly Smokes this place is insane! Those fries with all the trimmings that they serve in a bucket ... the mac and cheese..  the grilled cheese.. the burnt pork ends.. the list goes on! Brisket is a special order but you need to go early to get it otherwise they run out lol Fantastic place to dine... I recomended it to all fellow meat eaters ;)"}
{"text":"It is very good. I've tried dozens and dozens of BBQ joints in the southern US, and these guys do a fine job. I fear, however, it might be a little too down to earth for an area known for its banal cuisine and stiff uptight residents with Volvos and yippy little dogs.  So there's not enough seats and the place is crowded? So what? Go up to the bar, get a bourbon or a draft, and chat with the friendly owners while you wait for a table to open up. You'll have a blast, and if they like you they'll pour generously.  Brisket is always the acid test of a BBQ joint, and theirs is quite fine. Pulled Pork and beef ribs were also very good. The sides are all high quality.   If you have a stick up your wazoo about waiting for a table, get some takeout, bring it home, and chill. We need more places in this city that are exactly like this one."}
{"text":"Deep fried pickles were exceptional - so many places get this wrong (I'm looking at you, Stout!).   I ordered the Miss Piggy, and wish I had ordered only the spare ribs. There was nothing wrong w/ the chicken or the pulled-pork, but the spare ribs were perfect.  Service was good, but you absolutely MUST call ahead during busy periods to \"reserve\" a table. The only shortfall I find about this place is the lack of seating.  This place is going to be a zoo over the summer. Try to go now before it gets nice out.  Overall, it was bit spendy, but what isn't these days?"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I headed here craving some good BBQ. The staff were incredible, welcoming and answering all the questions we had. Our waitress was casual, fun and knew the menu very well.  We ordered an appetizer of mac n cheese balls and a combo platter of sausage, wings, beef brisket and fries and while everything was DELICIOUS, the portions were a joke. We finished everything and started to talk about where we should go after to get more food. With two beers each and an 20% tip, the bill was over $100!   I don't think we will be returning solely for the fact that if I spend over $100 on a dinner,  I better not have to hit up a mcdonalds on the way home."}
{"text":"First let me say that best side dish is the chilli. I could order it on its own it's so good. The BBQ is good but as with a lot of places the meat is a little fatty. The sauces they serve are awesome! The service is really good - they make you feel welcome. Great addition to the Beach."}
{"text":"My partner and I enjoyed lunch here.  I ordered the beef brisket sandwich with beans and sweet potato fries.  My partner had the Carolina pulled pork sandwich with beans and cornbread.  I liked the fact I had a choice of sides.  The beans were awesome.  I also liked that I could add the sauce of my choice to the sandwich.  All of this went down nicely with a Beau's beer.  A perfect seat at the window and service was attentive.  Next time we'll check out the patio in the back."}
{"text":"If you like meat, this is a place you need to go. I recently visited this restaurant and liked their food a lot. The atmosphere is casual and food was great. I wanted to had ribs but then i changed my mind and had their brisket and house beer(light). I give 5 out of 4. Parking is bit tricky in this area and the restaurant is small. I had to wait for a while to get waiter's attention but otherwise it was good experience."}
{"text":"Attended Hogtown last week. Wife and I split the meat sampler platter and it was very good!  Large enough for the two of us. The brisket is fantastic!  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Came in a little later on Friday night looking to try their baby back ribs.  Unfortunately they were out of the ribs when we arrived but switched to the brisket and chicken wings which were absolutely incredible.  Atmosphere was great and the wait staff were very friendly.  Definitely going back, but this time a little earlier to make sure we get the ribs"}
{"text":"Went there on December 22, there was a local power outage so the place was a little busy but we were seated right away. The first thing we were told was how under staffed they were, which in my mind is key for \"don't expect much\". It was my birthday and was excited to try this place.   We ordered the deep fried pickles to start. At 10 bucks an order I expected a good portion, I was wrong. The pickles were hardly coated in the batter and most of it had fallen off the pickles into the basket. It was a huge disappointment. Also there were only 7 or 8 pieces in the basket making it not worth 10 dollars.   For our main we ordered the platter for two and chose brisket, \"competition\" ribs, and chicken wings. The brisket is ok. Very VERY fatty. We were shocked that they did not trim the brisket at all before or after smoking it. It was very greasy but has some good flavour. The chicken wings were smoked then fried making the skin good but making them overly greasy and the meat a little mushy. There was no smoke flavour or anything else to them.   On to the \"competition ribs\".... When we asked what competitions they won we were told \"all of them\". We discovered that by competition they mean rib fests, so not real competition BBQ. The ribs were disgusting. It tasted like we were chewing on a bag or charcoal. Their smoker was obviously not burned off enough and the raw charcoal flavour ruined the ribs. They had a almost burnt barque on them which was inedible. Out of the 6 bones we were given with out meal between the two of us, we ate one.   Our sides were corn bread, sweet potato fries and beans. The corn bread was nice but as a side you only get one muffin for the two people. The sweet potato fried were nothing special. The beans were terrible. They tasted like canned beans with some rootbeer and grated onion thrown into the pot.   This was disappointing as we had visited the food truck before and enjoyed what we had. We wish them all the best and there is great potential there."}
{"text":"Brisket poutine all day long. Amazing !!! Glad I stopped in before I hit the beach. Great drinks as well!! Would definitely recommend. The meats selection is huge and close to some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"This is a good restaurant but in my opinion they are charging 10 to 15 percent more than others.  There is another place not far down the road that is equally good with more reasonable prices.  The service here is also so-so.  Brisket is too fatty.  Ribs and chicken are quite good."}
{"text":"Just had the $5 burger week burger and it was phenomenal. Best $5 I ever spent (or didn't spend-thanks to PayPal!) Had a side of fries that me and my bf split.The fries were a good simple side to their flavourful meat.  We also walked/slid over here on the day of the ice storm for a two person feast. We had the two person platter. The brisket is amazing, make sure you order some. There was enough leftovers from our platter to have for dinner the next night. Not to mention they have beaus lug tread on tap!  This place is as an occasional indulgence due to all the fat and salt. But well worth the indulgence."}
{"text":"I ordered a Kansas city hit dog from the hogtown smoke food truck during the jazz festival, mostly because there didn't appear to be much of a lone, and I was excited to try their food for the first time.  9 minutes into my wait, I'm told they are having problems with the portable gas supply and they could not make my hot dog.  They offered a refund of my $10, or a pulled pork sandwich that was of equal value.  I reluctantly chose the sandwich that I got 5 minutes later.  The pork was prepared properly, but was extremely bland and not worth the $10 and 15 minute wait, when it should have been free.  Very disappointing first impression, and I'm not sure I want to try the beach location now."}
{"text":"WILL NOT RETURN - DISORGANIZED SERVICE LEAVES FOUL AFTER TASTE  Ordered takeout for a 13-person gathering two days in advance, did not receive order confirmation as promised, had to call DAY OF myself to make sure they could fill request.  Right before scheduled pick up, received last-minute call advising debit/credit machines were down and payment for large order would be CASH ONLY. Got stuck in traffic while travelling to Hogtown and called to advise, NO PICK UP, then, received call where server made snide comments about no longer being sure of when I was supposed to arrive or IF I remembered the order. When order received, Hogtown missed nearly HALF the items and sold me one wrong dish, leaving me with insufficient food for my guests. Consequently, guests made to wait because of Hogtown's DISORGANIZATION, while friends and I scrambled to fill the gap with other more trustworthy businesses."}
{"text":"We arrived on time for our 8 pm reservation on a busy Saturday night, to find out I made reservations for the Sunday night in error. The staff did everything possible to find our party of 5 a table. And everything just got better, food, service and beverages were all fantastic.  Thank you to the team"}
{"text":"It's too cold to enjoy the outdoors back patio, but the food is still good, though lacking in that smokehouse feel. I think the smartest way to eat here is to split an order of back ribs between two people and order a side. Very tasty but not an overdose of pretty high-fat meat. I had vinegared cole slaw as my side dish, and it was very good.  Coffee is mediocre --made from one of those eco-horrible machines that do one serving at a time of stale coffee in those throwaway plastic cups.  The main server is a real livewire, lots of fun a very good at her job. In my ebook on Food for City Building, I argue that cities need a host of independent restaurants to make main streets come alive, so a place like this is welcome.  The other point they add -- or added until the imitators followed them -- is that independents need to use their edge as independents to do something unique and non-franchisable -- franchises can only survive with an algorithm that can be turned into a mass market/mass production/cheap labor offering. Smoke houses use to offer that, but I think they now have to up their game to stay unique and special and worth the extra money."}
{"text":"I can only give this place a 4 for now cause I haven't tried more than one meal. But the pulled pork grilled cheese tho?!!!?? I'm saying, you need to come here JUST for this if you're on the move and hungry. The staff was so friendly especially our server Holly. She was quick and cared about everyone that was in the restaurant. It felt genuine and like a place I want to frequent. I'm definitely coming back here again. Great find on the go."}
{"text":"Hubby ordered takeout from this place and he came back with one container of food . Then told me he paid over $102.00 for it. He had  show me the bill because I didn't believe him. So after the shock of the bill I started on the food and it was a big disappointment. We love BBQ and this was not good at all. We had some chicken wings, ribs and the mac and cheese. So not worth the money or our time. Don't be deceived by the other reviews - it just not good BBQ !!! Period."}
{"text":"Came for the Burger Week pulled pork burger, and was intrigued enough that I would give the regular menu a try, though I have some reservations with the BBQ scene heating up in Toronto.  When I heard that a BBQ place was doing a free burger, I was intrigued enough to make it out to the beaches for a try.  Getting there was a bit tough, as they're doing construction on the curb outside, and you have to pass through a construction zone and a wooden bridge to get inside.  Once inside, the place is welcoming enough, but it seems like the kind of place where they don't have to work very hard for your business, as the place always seems full, which is reflected in the service. Paying by Paypal was also a chore, as the reception at the cash register was bad, so I had to schlepp it out to the front of the store to check-in before they could process the payment.  The pulled pork burger itself was delicious, with a good mix of beef and pulled pork, topped with BBQ sauce.  The charring was either excessive or in line with BBQ, depending on your tastes.  As far as burger week goes, I would rate the burger in the top half of the scale, with Toma coming out on top.    Will update this review if I decide to come back for the regular menu."}
{"text":"Hands down the best bbq in Toronto.  The quality of all the meat is amazing - smoked to perfection...have tried many different things and will keep coming back! The staff is super friendly and I wold recommend the Ribs, the smoked wings and the Angus brisket that melts in your mouth with a delicious bark. The owners definitely know what they are doing and they don't scrimp on quality!"}
{"text":"Nice Botique BBQ place in the heart of The Beaches in Toronto. This place is for meat lovers although they have a few other items such as Tofu salad or Salmon Salad. Its been a while since i have been to the Beaches but it was the Jaz festival so i picked up the family after work and rushed down before the masses arrived. The restaurant was small typical of the area but they have a quaint patio in the back. Being early we were lucky to sit there for our dinner.   I tried the three meat menu option and doubled the Burnt Ends with chicken wings and i choose the purple coleslaw for the side for $30. I couldnt finish it. This dish is good for two big boys or three fine ladies to share. The wings were exellent and the burnt end absolutely delicious. I highly recommend it although not for calory contious fokls as the cooking sauce must have sugar and lots of salt. My son ordered the deep fried mac & cheese balls. I tried a little and it was good, sort of unique. my 12 year old rated it 8 of 10 but he didnt dip it in the spicy sauce. I think that would have helped. This mac & cheese is for big kids - like 20 and over. He didnt eat the outside crust on the second ball as he was getting full. He had 3 of my wings too! I wathced the plated of people around us. The chicken and the bone in BBQ meats looked great as well. I think all their BBQs are great.   listen, once in a while a man from Markham needs some food variety and a real BBQ that is from Toronto. I enjoyed the calaries with no regret and BTW: the jaz festival was fantastic. I will find a reason to go back before the summer is over. BTW: all the workers in the restaurant were jolly and seemed to like their job."}
{"text":"Delicious food!  Friendly service but didn't seem to be enough servers to run smoothly. Didn't get drinks or water until after we finished our meals. Waited a very long time both to have our order taken and for food.  Bought a groupon but was next to impossible to get a reservation using a groupon. If you're going to do a promotion don't make it a pain to use, it's tacky! You should consider some kind of sharing platter of sides as an add on option. We would have ordered for sure, it was tough to decide between them, and they all great (fries, slaw, Mac n cheese, baked beans)."}
{"text":"My staple here is the grilled cheese, a really amazing mix of sautéed onions, pulled pork, and Monterey Jack. For sides, I've tried the chilli, corn bread muffin, Caesar salad, and sweet potato fries... All good except the chilli, I found it had too many peppers, too little meat or spices.   The service is always friendly but they do get very crowded once 6PM hits."}
{"text":"Great customer service and delicious poutine! The brisket poutine is fairly expensive, $20 after taxes, however you definitely get a decent portion. The brisket is a $2 upgrade from the pulled pork poutine but one that I highly recommend. The brisket was incredibly tender with a great smokey flavor. I would suggest splitting this with someone since the size is massive!"}
{"text":"I called to get a quote for a large order and was told to expect a call back but it never happened. I called back to put a final order in but upon my arrival I realize they did not give the right items. I had tried to confirm the order over the phone. I was in too much of a rush to check and only realized upon arriving home. With several phone calls I had expected the order to be not so disastrous at pickup. Horrible customer service and very unorganized. Machines were also down so I had to run off to get cash for a huge order. For a prime Saturday night that's disappointing.  $18 for a ridiculous small portion of rib tips was also, ridiculous..."}
{"text":"Craft beer and smoked meat. What more could you ask for?  The location is small but the smokehouse/pen theme they had going on with the decor was well done. Long wooden tables and benches and low hanging lights made from tin buckets really set the mood. One wall is a chalkboard (as in the entire wall) where they have specials and other info. The other wall is a gallery adorned with photographs taken by a local artist.  Our group had thier smoked meat sampler where they go around the table and everyone chooses 3 meats and they bring out all the meats piled onto a huge wooden slab. Brisket, Ribs, Chicken, Sausages everything was excellent. The meal was further enhanced by their available home made sauces. They had some interesting stuff including a Mango Habanero sauce, A Blueberry BBQ sauce, and a sauce known only as The Hogfather. The blueberry BBQ was definable my favorite. I regret not buying a bottle while I was there.   Our waitresses were very friendly and attentive, and their recommendations regarding the sauce/meat/beer pairings were spot on. I'm not familiar with Canadian micro brews, but the recommended Beau's was refreshing and not too bitter.   Would love to make another visit next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"We just had the best smoked meat of our lives today at Hogtown Smoke. Seriously, get the brisket. Incredible."}
{"text":"If I could leave less than 1 star, I would.  I ordered via a third party delivery service.  After the meal was 10 minutes later than the 75 minute delivery time, I called the restaurant - only to find out they had cancelled my order because one of the items wasn't available (their menu on the app was clearly out of date).  They went so far as to lie about whether they had my phone number.  Now I'm out-of-pocket over $75 until my refund goes through in 2-5 business days.  Based on their customer service, I won't bother trying them again."}
{"text":"Tried going here tonight but either they were closed at 8 without a notice on their phone, website and door, or they saw us trying the door for 5 minutes and didn't come open it. Either way, worst service ever. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Food was good. We had lunch.  A brisket sandwich for All and salad with brisket for me. Some menu items were not available. Service was friendly. A bit expensive. I would go back for dinner."}
{"text":"I usually get the jacked up grilled cheese sandwich with one modification, I ask them to switch the pulled pork with their smoked beef brisket. That sandwich paired with their smoked ham poutine as a side is an extremely satisfying meal!"}
{"text":"THEY WANT YOU IN AND OUT OF THAT SEAT AS FAST AS POSSIBLE:  WHO CARES IF YOU HAVEN\"T FINISHED EATING.  There's nothing I like better than BBQ so you can imagine that when this place opened I was thrilled.  First two visits: food was amazing, service was prompt.  I couldn't say enough nice things about it.  I won't rant about the pricing.  It is meat and as we are all aware, food isn't cheap lately....but it's not a place where you think, 'hey, let's eat out tonight' without considering what a casual dinner will run you.  The last time I visited, we took friends of ours.  It was the first time we had met since my friend's husband had passed on.  Bear with me, this is key to note.  We arrived just after the lunch hour and prior to the dinner rush so that we could have a meal and have a quiet conversation.    What went right: -  We got a table right away.  No waiting.  Here's what went wrong: - The waitress expected us to order before we even took our jackets off.  I knew what I wanted however as 1st timers, my friends didn't have a clue.  We had to insist that the server return when we had a chance to actually look at the menu. -  The portion size was small, overcooked and extremely dry.  But that wasn't the worst of it. -  The server did not know what soft drinks they had...they also had no clue whether there was anything on the menu that wasn't available.  -  Our server constantly interrupted our conversation.  I love attentive service, but this was ill-timed.  Just as my friend was telling me what her husband's final words were before he slipped into a coma, we were interrupted yet again.  We're talking a mid-sentence interjection of 'how you doing here?' which didn't happen just once, it was a constant barrage.  I felt like asking her if she wanted to sit down and join us. -  Our plates were whisked away although it was evident that we were not finished eating....and the check just dumped on the table.  Although there were free tables and other diners in the restaurant, we certainly got the bum rush.  Late lunch for 4 in less than an hour including perusing the menu and paying the bill.  I support local businesses but this one can drop off the face of the earth.  They should have just gone with a take-out counter because the only thing they're interested in is turning those tables over as fast as possible.  Staff are not customer focused.  If you want to eat without feeling harassed and your wallet fleeced, don't go here."}
{"text":"Best free burger thanks to PayPal and burger week!  A sloppy mess, but oh so yummy!    Angus burger with pulled pork, cheese, pork belly, and more pulled pork with BBQ sauce and bourbon.  I was told it was small but it was a solid burger.    Staff was friendly and very patient.  We couldn't get the PayPal app to do what we wanted but everything was sorted out in the end."}
{"text":"This was our first time and will definitely be back. Teena recommended the burnt ends and grilled cheese sandwich. Great suggestions, friendly staff and nice patio."}
{"text":"The brisket here was very delicious and the interior has a great layout. It is pricey but you get a huge portion for what you pay and  I had leftovers to last me for another dinner or day after. The beer on draft is great to go with a nice sandwich or side. Included in the price of a sandwich is 2 sides so it is a good deal overall!"}
{"text":"First time but definitely not the last. Walked in as a threesome so we ended up getting the Wilbur Platter which serves 3 to 4 plus the Pulled Pork Poutine. The Wilbur has large juicy BBQ wings, 1/2 brisket, rib, and half chicken. The brisket was my fave. The place was small and packed. We ended up going to the bar across the street to kill our 1 hour wait...but I tell you...worth the wait. Good atmosphere. Great staff. Gluten sauces which the Mrs would probably appreciate. I would say bring one out to the west end but I fear may ruin the appeal as it did with Wild Wings. Stay small. Stay awesome. We'll come to you."}
{"text":"After recently moving to Toronto I've been searching for a new refuge for good quality BBQ. I'm so glad I've tried this place out and have been going back ever since. The menu is very diverse..so many things to try out. Ribs, great...good smoke to them. The brisket has a good flavour ring around it and the bark on it is delicious. Their appetizers are very inventive...the jalapeno cheddar sasuage bites are a must try.  And just for shear entertainment value...order the kitchen sink fries...you won't be disappointed but make sure you have more than 2 people with you if you order it.  I'm a bit of a fiend for different flavour sauces and the have a good selection of them. The only challenge I have is that their top hot sauces aren't always available because they need to make more of it. This happened on a couple of visits. I also wish the \"dinosaur (beef) bones\" were available more often....the dilemma of a pitmaster I'm sure.   They have their own loyalty point program which is a nice touch and the service is very friendly and attentive ready to replenish you much needed supply of napkins ;-).  You have a a loyal customer here!! Keep it the good work"}
{"text":"I dont even know how I should begin. I dont normally give 5 stars unless a place has exceeded my expectation greatly. I found this location through yelp and instagram and came with a group of 4. We decided to eat at the outside seating area which was located behind the restaurant. It was nice and cool with the perfect amount of shade everywhere! I loved the cute vintage decorations  everywhere and the atmosphere was so down-to-earth and relaxing. We were greeted by a waitress named Lizz who was bubbly, friendly and had  great suggestions. She was also very quick and efficient, frequently coming to check if everything was alright. This place should definitely be on your bucket list if you like yourself some nice juicy pulled pork menu. I never order a grilled cheese at restaurant but Lizz suggested it and I don't regret it at all, it was one of the best grilled cheese I've ever tried. So much flavour and quite filling! I have already suggested this place to many of my friends and I will surely return myself! :)"}
{"text":"We arrived fairly early on a Thursday so no problem getting a seat. Ordered a pinot grigio...my first mistake. Comes room temperature, when I tell her its warm, she goes, you wanna ice cube? Ummm, no, I want a glass of undiluted cold white wine, but if the ice cube is all you've got, I'll take it. She goes on to tell me she had just opened the bottle. You might want to refridgerate the rest of the bottle...and the others.  We started with the deep fried dill pickles. Deep fried dill pickles should not look like that. They were medallions. That's just wrong but they weren't bad. Would have been nice to have some cool ranch to go with them but they gave us chipotle without asking what we wanted.  We then ordered the pork poutine, and the half chicken with beans and creamy coleslaw. Loved the poutine, but I've had better chicken from the grocery store rotisserie. It was so dry I asked for bbq sauce, thought I could smother it a bit. She asks me, do you want mild or spicy. Mild please. Squirted bbq sauce all over my chicken to find out mild means hot. I'm assuming the spicy means suicide. I couldn't eat the chicken, not that I wanted to anyway, it was awful. So incredibly dry. The beans had a musty taste (baked beans should not taste like that) and the creamy coleslaw was so salty I couldn't eat it either. And I like my salt, trust me.  Was hoping to love this place but it just left a bad taste in my mouth. Literally"}
{"text":"They take BBQ seriously! I had previously read some of the reviews, the good and the bad, and fortunately none of the bad experiences happened to me. Service is very good, nice welcoming servers. The Stack of fries is a Winner!!! We ordered more than we should, but everything was delicious! I was ready to wait for the food, as that was the most common comment on the reviews, but the main came even too fast for us to finish the appetizer. Yes, the place is expensive (That's why Im giving 4 stars) but food is really good."}
{"text":"so to begin, there's not a huge choice in Toronto when it comes to legit barbeque and the review is always relative to other BBQ joints that we've been to  Overall, it's not a huge restaurant, and it's right down by the beach. It can definitely get quite busy over the weekends, but they also take reservations. If you go on weekdays, it's typically okay to walk-in - call ahead to confirm how busy it is.  We ordered the build-your own platter to our liking - there is no preset BBQ platter if that's what you're looking for, but they do give good recos. The unfortunate thing was that the Burnt Ends (which we were really looking forward to) weren't available until after 7:30pm... so it was a little bit of a WTF moment especially since we were there for 6pm dinner, which is normally prime dinner hour...  Sauces: there's around 6 homemade BBQ sauces that you can use to accompany your meats. They range in sweetness, smokiness, etc. Nice variety.  1855 Angus Brisket: probably the best piece of meat. It's moist, tender, and has a crispy outside. would definitely recommend. 5/5 1/3rd LB $12  smoked bird wings: These were pretty good, crispy but bone dry. You dip these wings in your choice of tableside sauces. 3/5 5 wings $11  Jalapeno and cheddar smoked sausage: super duper dry sausage. Probably wouldn't recommend. 2/5 1/2LB $10  St Louis side bones: large portion, probably only needed 1/3rd rack. Good flavour but on the dry side. 3/5 2/3 Rack $32  Baby back bones: These were probably the better ribs. They had a nice sauces over them and were well seasoned. AS you would expect, they were much more tender.4/5 1/3 Rack $17  2 Sides - Fries & Corn The grilled corn was killer. the downside was that it only came with 1.... that was a little lame. 5/5  The Fries were sizably portioned for 2 people. nice a crispy with a fluffy centre."}
{"text":"this place was voted one of the best ribs by blogTO but trust me it is NOT one of the best.  I had the st. louis ribs with a side of their purple slaw.  first of all the purple slaw had NO taste.  they drizzled a ton of oil on it and then maybe a bittt of balsamic.  I basically didn't eat it, and that is a very RARE thing for me.    so now about the ribs.  While they certainly are not bad, they are NOT the best i've had.  So maybe I am being a bit harsh, but only because I had such high expectations.  They were not even totally fall off the bone and the bbq sauce was lacking.  The best part was the seared fatty top part but the meaty part in between was almost bland and bit dry.  def not worth $30.  But what truly gives this place 1 star the management.  They were out of SOO many things on the menu.  The main being the baby back ribs, THE CORNBREAD (seriously?!?!), brisket, and literally at least 5 other things.  please keep in mind this was a weekday at 7pm seating.  the night has just started and your missing very core parts of your menu and legit at least a 3rd of your menu is gone.   the WORST management by a restaurant I have ever encountered in my life.  OO and to add, they list desserts on their menu.  BUT they do not have ANY of the desserts.  The waitress told us that the manager actually puts stuff on the menu that they don't have because they MIGHT get it in the future.  do not give your money to these liars."}
{"text":"Pretty interesting niche dining, modest-sized eatery but cozy effect.  Definitely make reservations for seating and for the infamous endz if you wanna secure a try as they sell it fast!  Loved the wow factor in the food presentations."}
{"text":"Had this place on a list of eateries to try out in the city - combined it with a movie date at the Fox Theatre nearby as a reason to venture out this far from home.  Like: Service was impeccable, so friendly I thought she owned the place (but I don't think she does).  Helpful and enthusiastic about most of the menu and happy to provide recommendations.  Atmosphere was nice, casual and simple.  Dislike: The price.  This is the singular reason I probably won't hit this place up again soon.  I really feel BBQ shouldn't cost two people $50 with only water to drink especially since there are other great Southern places to eat in the city for much cheaper.  Overall, I don't regret going by any means.  The food was good, although not great - sandwiches were fairly dry, and I wanted to try it out.  I just don't think it would be my go-to for BBQ in Toronto."}
{"text":"Way too overpriced for the amount of food you get. My boyfriend and I had the dinner for 2 so we could try a bit of everything. Meat was good, sides were boring - cornbread was extremely dry, coleslaw had no taste, beans tasted like they were from the can. In no way am I a picky eater, but when you're paying out the nose, I expect the best quality ever. Try it - or don't try it, it won't change your life!"}
{"text":"This place is so friggin good! I came here on a Saturday and it was pretty busy. We sat in the back patio area and our server happened to also be the owner. She was very sweet and attentive to all of our questions and is a treat to talk to. The menu is packed with everything you would expect from a Top Notch BBQ house.  Chicken, Cows, Pigs, and Delicious salads and Sides make up the menu.  I ordered the Dinosaur Bone which is only available on the weekends and it was a MASSIVE big BEEF RIB that was friggin Delicious!  It was marinated to perfection and extremly easy to eat!  I immediately regretted ordering the Babyback ribs, Pulled Pork, Fries, and Corn and Salad to go with it because my Stomach was already bursting from eating a T-Rex bone.   Nevertheless, I came prepared and wore my Stretchy Pants. The babyback ribs were hellagood and the sauces to go with it made it even more flavorful.  The pulled pork was beyond delicious and the fries and mac and cheese were simply amazing.  Everyone I was with loved the food and I will definitely be coming back here whenever I am craving to eat all farm animals and a Plethora or Meat.  Hogtown is Piggin Good!"}
{"text":"Came again and got the hog shank. It comes with side of creamy slaw and I upgraded the fries to the mac n cheese. Got to try the Caesar salad too.   I really enjoyed the hog shank! Spicy, tender, and nice smoky flavour. Lots of meat on the three bones. The mac and cheese was pretty good - nice option for trying all the table sauces. Caesar salad had wayyyy too much dressing. Wouldn't order that in the future. Creamy slaw was pretty average - good way to balance the meat portion with some cabbage."}
{"text":"Liked their back patio. Unfortunately the ribs (back) were simply not cooked long enough. Really hard to even cut them apart, and when biting in - meat was very hard. Not impressed with the sauces either - as they come the ribs are dry - there are three sauces available on the table: spicy, medium and sweet. Tried the mixed green salad and purple slaw and both were incredibly oily - oil is basically all you taste.  If you go, I think the beef brisket might be the best option - tried the tips appetizer and was definitely the best thing we had there. Macaroni balls were cheesy and pretty good too. The back patio is nice, service is prompt. But we went for the ribs and were disappointed. And it was really expensive as well - about 200 for 4, with two appetizers, 2 full racks of ribs, 1 beer, 1 shot, one ice tea."}
{"text":"I'm overdosed on meat!! Nice little BBQ joint. My waiter Skyler is very helpful. He explained how the platter works and recommended cuts of meat we should try. I was asking for a bit of Ghost Pepper Hot Sauce on the side but they ran out, he went to the kitchen and brought me a bottle of After Death Hot Sauce instead.   Food is very decent! We ordered the Ms Piggy platter. It includes 4 types of meat,  we picked Baby Back Ribs, Spare Ribs for an extra $4, Smoked Wings and Half Chicken; for the 3 sides we picked Creamy Slaw, Corn Bread Muffin & Fries.  The platter is not cheap, it's $56+$4, however, it's a lot of meat! We ended up packing the half chicken and half a rack of Spare Ribs home. I think that platter can easily be shared with 3 very hungry people.   The Corn Bread Muffin was straight from the oven, the crust is crunchy and the inside is steamy & moist. So good!!!  The Ribs and Wings are very good, I like the fact they have 4 different homemade BBQ sauce on the table that you could use generously.  I like spicy sauce, so my favourite is the Habanero Mango and Spicy BBQ sauce. The BBQ sauce has just the right amount of heat without striping off the flavor of the meat.   It's a Friday night, me and my husband had to share a table with another couple. It must be the atmosphere and the food here, we ended up having great conversation with that young couple. This would be a fun place to eat if you have 6-8 people. They serve the large meat platter on a chopping block.   Come here hungry!!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for a patio in The Beach. I'm always interested in food that requires a bib so I was looking forward to some BBQ.  The staff was friendly and attentive. No complaints about the service.   Unfortunately the food was missing some TLC.   We both got the pulled pork with different sides. The first side, cornbread, was flavourful. Super oily, but good. The mac n cheese side was OK- the taste was nice and peppery, but the texture was mushy and the pasta was very much overcooked.   The pulled pork itself was tender and stringy, and good with the BBQ sauce that you add yourself. Unfortunately it was luke warm.  The Caesar cocktail had a delicious smoky flavour.  Overall, it was OK. Overpriced for mediocre food, good service, and a sticky table on the back patio."}
{"text":"Had the spare ribs on a Sunday afternoon.  They were excellent (juicy not dry, easy off the bone, not too saucy), albeit a bit pricey. Mac and cheese side was awesome, thought the coleslaw was a bit watery. Excellent in-house sauces as accompaniments. Server was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch/dinner during the long weekend and herd about this place through family. Was not disappointed at all, service was friendly and fast. The food was amazing, defiantly a place to check out and make a weekly routine."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and shared two samiches with a friend and waddled back out. I was so full, I actually felt like throwing up.   The Sammiches are the best deal - a huge portion on a fresh bun (no gluten free option) along with 2 sides which were hearty it self.  We got the chilli - excellent, and coleslaw (to end the meal) with cornbread (yum) and fries (a little burnt).   I recommend the Burger for sure. It was juicy, tender and full of flavour. The pulled pork was a little dry and was lack lustre in comparison.   I found all the other mains were a little overpriced, but I think they are totally shareable and come in big portions.   It's small in here, but big enough for a handful of groups. Lovely smoked meat smell. Trendy with the exposed wood and buckets for lampshades."}
{"text":"The brisket was a symphony of smokey deliciousness. Try the BBQ beans, they were very tasty with a secret ingredient added. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Wahooooo, true BBQ in da beach......  At least that was my first thought, now after having had a chance to eat there, I'm not so sure....  Admittedly, they were very busy, we got the last table for 2 at around 8:30 PM last thursday, but that's still not much of an excuse for a 30 minute wait after ordering, and then barely warm food when it arrived...the wait was a surprise as this place seems to be well-staffed by fairly friendly people, despite being ran off their feet.  Decent variety of BBQ sauces, rated numerically from 4 to I think 16, personally I gave up before I got to 16....  Sampled the, well, sampler platter for two.... chose brisket, chicken and pork ribs, the best of the bunch by far was the chicken, unfortunate as I love a good side of ribs, got a very cartilage filled piece which makes it hard to work with, the meat that I did manage to get off of it was quite tender and nicely smoked.....decent amount of meat as well, the two of us left well fed, and unlike a lot of the other guests, we didn't need a carry-out container at the end, so I guess the meat was pretty good after all...  The sides (beans, fries and cornbread, simply can't have BBQ without cornbread, that's just wrong...) were also decent portions, and unlike the meat they arrived piping hot...  Given that they've only just open, willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, will be back in a few weeks when I have another craving for BBQ...."}
{"text":"I went to visit this place after reading an article in a local magazine and the various Yelp! Reviews.   I ordered the Three Meat Combo, Grilled Cheese and (No bean) Chili.   A note to the wise this is a busy section of The Beaches.  Parking is limited both on Queen St and the nearby side streets.    All meat I ordered was smoked: 10 wings, 1/3 lbs of beef brisket and 1/3 pulled pork.  The crowd favourite End Bits are not available until after 4:00 pm.  The chilli was decent with moderate heat and good taste.  I would have like some of the corn bread to accompany the chilli.   The grilled cheese was tasty with cheese, grilled peppers and pulled pork.   However, the price was a bit steep at $11.00  The wings were very good and the server gave me samples of their BBQ sauces.  I liked the following sauces were very tasty with my pulled pork and brisket: Mothers, Black & Blue and Beach.  The peanut sauce was decent but probably better with grilled chicken.   So why 3 stars.  The brisket had a fair bit of fat making it not worth the price.  The pulled pork was good.  The menu states the owners know how to smoke their meat and BBQ but aren't that much in to running a business.  Sadly there are other places that offer bigger portions at a fairer price while including fries, corn bread and coleslaw with the meal and not making them pricey add-ons."}
{"text":"We went here tonight and loved it. We shared the platter (2 people). 3 ribs, brisket, 4 chicken wings, Mac & 5 cheese and fries. You can pick from a list of options for the platter. I expected more food (especially the ribs) but it was filling. The mac & 5 cheese was served piping hot, which I love. I hate getting cold food. There are sauces on the table for your wings or other food.  We were seated outside which was really nice. Tables were cool. Bathrooms are small. Our server was a sweetheart. Food came quickly.  I'd go back, but I'd like to try the grilled cheese or poutine.  Food platter ($30), extra side of fries ($5), 2 beers ($16). Grand total of $57 with tax."}
{"text":"\"Hogtown Smoke is definitely a place to visit with family or just friends looking for something slightly out of the ordinary. We compared this place with one of our favourite west end spots - Barque Smokehouse. Hogtown Smoke wins in terms of its patio and attention to detail, looses in terms of its sides (smoky popcorn and roasted corn were a big plus for us). Overall, Hogtown Smoke is one of the best places we visited in Toronto's east end so far.  PS: a family of raccoons decided to pay us a visit throughout the dinner. \"  This is just a bite of our full review.."}
{"text":"While we were walking around The Beach, our tummies were rumbling.  It was perfect timing when we walked right by Hogtown Smoke...the smell beckoned us and we walked right in for lunch.  We got a perfect spot by the window.  We both wanted to devour the whole menu, but decided to order sandwiches since it would be \"less food\", ha!  While we were waiting for our meals, I eyed up the sauces on the table.  First their signature sauces, Hogmother (milder) and Father (spicier).  I personally didn't find that much of a difference in the heat level.  Both were tangy, well spiced, and a little sweet.  The father just being a little higher on the heat scale.  My meal was the Brisket Sandwich. Their signature meat was served on a nice fluffy bun.  The 18-hour smoked brisket was smoky, succulent and fell apart  My only wish was that the fries I got were crispier. My other side was the chili.  It was a couple dollars more as an upgrade, but worth it!  It was pork and brisket chili goodness topped with cheese and sour cream.   My mom got the Pulled Pork Sandwich with sweet potato fries and vinegar slaw.  The pork was tender and delicious.  The meal was great and I will be back for more :)"}
{"text":"These people need to learn how to answer their phone.  Multiple times I've tried to place an order for pickup, only to have the phone ring and ring then go to voicemail."}
{"text":"I'm not sure where the negative reviews are coming from. This place was excellent. Great foods and lots of it. Best Mac and cheese I've ever had. A little expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"Brisket and Burnt Ends to die for.  House made sauces are delicious, and spicy, but not overwhelming hot just for the sake of being hot.  Small and intimate setting that fills up fast.  Definitely on my list of best bbq in the city"}
{"text":"I like barbecue and because I like it I tend to avoid restaurants that serve barbecue outside of the American barbecue belt.  But I got caught in a rain storm the other day outside of Hogtown Smoke, so I decided to grab a bite and wait out the storm. First off it was 2pm and I was the only customer after the lunch rush.  Now my test for a barbecue place is always the brisket.  On most places it tend to be dry.  In Canada I hear people ordering it lean.  Lean brisket please. Now here I had a choice, just meat or on a bun and a choice of a side.  I had just the meat and a side of cornbread. The server was excellent attentive without being overly so.  While I was waiting I decided not to indulge in there list of beers and ciders on tap.  But just to have a soda water.  It arrived quickly. The dish was a generous amount of freshly smoked brisket.  The meat was moist and had just the right amount of fat on it.  The bark on the brisket was fantastic.  If there is any criticism it might be that it was just a little bit too salty.  But that is just my taste.  I love the brisket it's the best that I've had in Canada!  Now the cornbread came as a muffin and was overly buttery tasting imho.  But hey, it is always just a matter of taste. The big question after eating there and digesting the meal so to speak is would I go back? The answer to that is in a heartbeat!  Kudos to my server and the pitmaster!"}
{"text":"I am so happy that this fabulous BBQ restaurant opened in The Beaches. Needless to say, this is a busy place--it's a smaller space and the demand is huge, so it's not surprising that it takes a while to get a table. It seemed that many people who couldn't get a table decided to order take-out because the food is just that good.  We ordered the sampling platter and it was extremely good! And the prices were very reasonable. BBQ sauce selection is great! Everyone in the restaurant was just devouring the food on their plates because everything was so delicious!  Service could be a little kinder but that couldn't detract from the amazing food. If you're planning a visit, I would recommend that you arrive earlier in the evening to get a table (maybe 6-ish). I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I finally found the time to make a visit to this resto and brought along three friends to indulge in what Hogtown Smoke has to offer.  The service was friendly and relatively quick given that the resto was packed with hungry patrons.  The smell of BBQ permeating the humid summer air that day.  As a group of four, we decided to order the following items to share across the table that would represent a small cross-section of the menu:  Brisket Burnt Ends Hogtown Poutine Create-Your-Own-Platter: Back Ribs, Spare Ribs, and Brisket Smoked Brisket Sandwich with Sweet Potato Fries  If you are a first timer then I would def recommend getting a sampler create-your-own-platter and I really enjoyed both the brisket and back ribs.  Both were really soft and had lots of the smokey bbq flavour.  This platter is potentially enough for two people depending on your hunger level.  The poutine lived up to it's name and was just smothered in gravy which is never a bad problem to have.  Fries weren't soggy and held up well  The four table-side sauces they offered complimented the items well and I enjoyed the Hogfather (hot) sauce but did not try the mango habanero sauce (I am not crazy!).  Enjoyed my time here and look forward for another opportunity to return. :-)"}
{"text":"I ordered the Carolina Pulled pork sandwich which came with your choice of 2 sides, I chose the mac and cheese and fries, as well as pig candy for delivery through Just-Eat. The sandwich said it came topped with coleslaw, I assumed there would be somekind of bbq sause on the actual pulled pork. But no, it was DRY. The taste was fine, but I've never heard of a dry pulled pork sandwich and I would have appreciated a note to inform me to choose the sauce separately. The coleslaw was fairly bland and soggy as well. The fries were almost black, soggy, and a few were actually under cooked. The mac and cheese was edible. The pig candy (chocolate covered bacon) wasn't good. The bacon itself was good, thick cut and cooked to chewy not cripsy, which is how I prefer it but the taste if the chocolate wasn't good and didn't pare well with the bacon. I realize that the delivery could have caused some of the sogginess but I doubt it. I get delivery often and am always trying new places, so I like to think I'm a pretty good judge of when the food itself is an issue and when it's the delivery process that causes the problems. The total including a $5 delivery tip and $3.99 delivery charge came to just shy of $40. Not even close to worth it."}
{"text":"The patio is set up for summer. The ribs were cooked to perfection. But lunch with soft drinks for 2 cost $75 with tip! We didn't have to eat again for 3 days which softened the blow."}
{"text":"I usually am huge fan of BBQ but this place didn't really impressed me as I went back twice last night with my husband. I've ordered my usual favorite appetizers the fried pickles they are ever so small and disappointing not to mention expensive of a $10!!!! I've had better!!! Ordered chicken wing for 7 pieces for $13!!! Can you say overprice?!! I give it a 2 stars but not worth the money."}
{"text":"Like most of the reviews of read but had to see for myself waaaay to pricey for what you get. I've had better and just as good for more reasonable prices. I'm not saying the food or sauces are bad they are good but not at the portion sizes. They bring you a bottle of pop for $3.50 so no fountain refills, they offer no water, you have to ask. Service for the size and time I went was slow: So for $80.00 with tip for 2 people and sodas is crazy for ok BBQ. I prefer Memphis BBQ on Islington Ave."}
{"text":"If you love BBQ food, you have to come here to get your BBQ craving, it's a nice BBQ restaurant located in the Beaches area, you can come here for their delicious beef brisket. Heard that they have really good beef brisket so my friends and I came here and decided to try it out! There is limited seating here but it wasn't busy when we arrived after work on a Thursday evening. They do have daily specials and have a decent list of craft beers and wine. I did the \"Create your Own\" Platter so I choose 1/3 of the beef brisket, pulled pork and the jalapeno and cheddar smoked sausage. The good part of this is that you get to try a variety of their meats and in different portions depending if you are trying it yourself or sharing it with others. Food came out pretty quickly and everything was quite delicious. A decent portion for what you are paying for as I was quite stuffed after the meal. They also have various other dishes and appetizers you can order as well. I thought their fries was just okay- nothing special about that. Overall, a decent place to get your BBQ fix!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a hot August day.  Sat in the back patio... good craft beer selection, and great food!  The pulled pork grilled cheese is amazing, AND comes with sides (get the cornbread!)  Staff is super chill and very nice.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times and I'm starting to become addicted lol. The food is SO delicious. If you're craving meat. This is the place. I've had the salads, the amazing chile verde, brisket, ribs and mac and cheese dishes and all cooked to perfection with SO much flavour. The staff is friendly and attentive. Love it!"}
{"text":"i got the el hefe and loved it, the black and blue sauce was great."}
{"text":"No complaints. Every time we have come here which has been quite a few times, the food is always hot and delicious and flavorful and Smokey. You will not leave hungry. Also they do have a pretty good beer selection to go with your delicious meat. Try the Rib tips, just remember to leave some for me."}
{"text":"Quaint little place with an amazing patio with sun protection. old wood burning stoves for decor, beautiful wood slab tables. We ordered the pulled pork poutine and it was hands down the BEST poutine I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"Yum. Amazing ribs and wings... and the grilled cheese sandwich with pulled pork was delicious.  I also like how they have local beer."}
{"text":"One of the best southern style BBQ I have ever had. Even better than some places I go in US with the advantage of being close to home ;-)"}
{"text":"Amazing amount of selections for sauces for your bbq meats. I love how juicy the shrimps are here, you can tell they're fresh not frozen!"}
{"text":"Great place for meat lovers! My friends got a custom platter. You can choose 3 meats & 1 side for $30. 3 people shared this and it was more than enough. Options include ribs, wings, 1/4 chicken, burnt ends, lamb, etc. For sides we got sweet potato fries, which were very yummy with the right amount of crisp and softness. I also got the mac & cheese balls, deep fried and crunchy on the outside and soft like mac & cheese should be on the inside. Be sure to try the 4 in house sauces. They range from mild to super spicy! I love the \"Black and Blue\" one."}
{"text":"Came here for some bbq  after checking out the scarborough bluffs. The front of the resto is small and has a few picnic style booths. We went to the back of the restaurant where they have a sheltered patio with large tables made from slabs of wood and high chairs. Has a hipster vibe - craft beers, random signs, hanging bike from ceiling of patio, exposed brick walls. We ordered the bbq platter - pulled pork, brisket, and chicken wings. I was not too impressed. The pulled pork was super dry - making it very hard to eat - threw a lot of the hogfather bbq sauce on it. Brisket and chicken wings were ok. Everything is smoked in house overnight apparently. I think I just like my bbq with more flavour and sauce. My experience here was not tasteful enough to make me come back unfortunately."}
{"text":"After a hard morning laying concrete with my family, we came here. It was Saturday and we were a little early (open at 12). They happily let us come in and sit down. The (I assume) owner was at the booth beside us, and the waitress went to check what was ready.  We ordered, brisket mostly and I (vegetarian) got the kitchen sink fries, pork on the side and deep fried pickles! ( Done right! Not long wedges, chips!!) The meals were HUGE, and delicious.  I am waiting for an excuse to head back.  Is been by a few times, and am always on the lookout for a good BBQ place that will meet my husbands high standards. He liked it, thought the brisket was good, but the textures was indicative of frozen beef.  I understand you have to arrive early most days, and items often run out."}
{"text":"Nice patio, the mist is interesting, not cooling though.  Amsterdam Brewery beer on tap - Boneshakerrr!!   I had 1/3 pound from: brisket, burnt ends and pulled pork plus baked beans and mac n cheese, That was a lot of food!  I ate from the leftovers for dinner and breakfast the next day.  Verdict:   1. Brisket: nice and juicy, definitely good, but I had better.  2. Burnt ends: pretty good, best I had in Toronto, but not comparable to some places in USA 3. Pulled Pork: amazing! Fresh and flavorful! Next time I'd get just the pulled pork!  the baked beans and mac n cheese were regular-good, not a bad purchase for the price.  They've got lots of funky sauces - don't worry, even the hot ones are not too hot (i.e. they are 'white people hot' hehe; no offense, I'm white too), but add nice flavour to the meat.  Great place if you're by the beach and craving some animal flesh! :)"}
{"text":"Went here while on vacation. We're big pulled pork fans, so of course we had to try it! The sauces were great. The slaw was acceptable. The pork was well cooked. The stand out of our meal was the mac n cheese! This was, by far, the best I've ever had outside my own kitchen. My family apologized to me and I humbly admitted I had been bested. This stuff was amazing!!! We're actually planning another trip so we have an excuse to go back and eat here again.  Until then, I'll be busy upping my mac n cheese game, I may have been beat, but I won't stay down for long!"}
{"text":"This is not a 'meh' 3-star place, this is a good, solid 3-star place. We tried the pulled pork sandwich, the brisket burger, mac n cheese, beans and fries. It's a bbq place so let's cover that off first.  The pulled pork was smoked for 14 hours. I dunno what wood they used, but I couldn't taste the smoke despite the pink smoke ring. Most pulled pork is more tender and sauced. Their version is chunkier and unsauced. It tasted more like lechon which isn't a bad thing, but bbq-wise, it seemed off the mark. However, they give you a lot, including some outside brown and it's still porky goodness, especially when paired w/ one of their sauces.   The burger I'm told is good and filling. So there ya go.  The fries are crisp and plentiful and good. The mac n cheese is good. The beans were one note: sweet so I added mustard to make it more savory. I'd definitely come back here."}
{"text":"My fiance was doing a story on their restaurant and had gotten two burgers and some sides (coleslaw and mac and cheese) to go and surprised me with dinner last night! I tried both their original burger and their brisket burger. The original burger was tasty, but a bit disappointing because the patty was quite dry, and i like my patties more moist in burgers. I then tried the brisket burger and it did not disappoint! their brisket was really good. added a bit of mother and B&B sauce and a hint of mustard and this was a really great! the mac and cheese was quite tasty, but it wasn't anything like \"wow\". Their coleslaw was quite refreshing and i like that it's purple :) Anyway would definitely want to come back to this place for burgers but mostly for the brisket one :) and would want to also try their brisket poutine!"}
{"text":"Not usually a huge meat eater went for a Father's Day meal and ordered a porky pig platter which came with an assortment of meats and 5 sides. There was six of us and we all left happy and full! The chicken wings were my favourite and perfectly juicy and just the right amount of crispness to them. The staff were friendly and quick with drink orders and food orders and were happy to explain the menu. You can't really go wrong here they have Beaus on tap and serve mass amounts of meat. If you're ever in he beaches area, check it out for some great barbecued food"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food!! We keep going back because the Mac and cheese and wings are to die for!! Great cider on tap, and amazing service too!! Make sure to book reservations!!"}
{"text":"After it was featured on You Gotta Eat Here, Hogtown Smoke jumped to the top of my list of places to try. My dining companion and I arrived right at 12:00 on a Sunday, and after waiting for the restaurant to open (15 minutes late, I might add), we found a booth inside.  I knew walking in I wanted the Jack'd Up Grilled Cheese, which the menu describes as \"Jack Daniels infused pulled pork with beer braised onions & red pepper, enveloped with white and orange cheddar with Monterey jack on Cobb Fresh pally Thick Sliced Bread.\" I also ordered the creamy slaw and chili on the side. My dining companion ordered the Signature Smoked Brisket sandwich, which is \"18 hr 'low & slow' Smoked Angus Brisket. Sliced, chopped & piled on a Cobb Fresh Daily bun.\"  So the grilled cheese sandwich was very tasty. It didn't arrive piping hot, though, which was a big disappointment (clearly it had been sitting around as the other food was being prepared). Anyway, it was full of delicious cheese, meat, and peppers, although I found it odd that there wasn't a hint of smokiness in the sandwich. I chalked that up to the overpowering nature of the item's other ingredients.  However, my dining companion's brisket sandwich, which is presented without any sauces or distractions, was also distinctly lacking in a smoke flavor. The meat was very good, to be sure, as it was quite tender and juicy, but there was simply no smokiness at all. It seems that finding actual, authentic Southern BBQ in Toronto is a lost cause.  The creamy slaw was definitely a step above most other slaws of this ilk, but it was the chili that was the big winner here. Packed with chunks of meat and full of delicious spices, I could've eaten this chili all day. A true winner."}
{"text":"Good smoke restaurant and I've eaten here a couple times already. Last time, the Owner was teaching/yelling at staff about work productivity.  A bit unprofessional. Also, the staff always seem a bit stressed out. Otherwise, the food and the sauces are good. The prices are bit expensive for the portion size."}
{"text":"By chance we found this place while exploring Beaches.   An absolute must if you like BBQ!   The burnt ends, which sell out quickly for obvious reason, were amazing.   Great service and a cool patio."}
{"text":"Waitress messed up orders, service was extremely slow and food was mediocre, didn't taste fresh. They were out of a few drinks and main dishes."}
{"text":"Saw people at the beach with great looking sandwiches and got the tip from them. Place is located directly on Queen. The patio is nice and you can watch the kitchen staff working on the smoker. Definitely a place for meat lovers. You can choose all sorts of different smoked meats. We went for pulled pork and brisket sandwich with corn and slaw on the side. Really liked the creamy slaw. To sum it up: Great sandwich, nice patio. A little pricey on the drink side though"}
{"text":"Love this place. Booths inside and a big patio out back. Staff is really helpful. We ordered way too much food (they warned us it would be too much) but made great leftovers. Brisket, pulled pork, sausages, can't go wrong. Mac n cheese was great too. Good cocktail menu."}
{"text":"Delicious food although the service is not consistent especially if the place is busy.  I would stay away if there is a line up and try another time during non-peek.  Also.... please actually include beer prices on your beverage list - ordering a beer shouldn't be a guessing game."}
{"text":"The food is quite good (chicken, ribs, corn and slaw).  The service was nice but i think the place was slammed with clients all at the same time.  The price is slightly on the high end, but the quality ous much better than other BBQ restaurants.   Will go back perhaps when the weather is warmer so that we can check out the patio."}
{"text":"Awesome service. Truly a cozy, friendly atmosphere with absolutely terrific, delicious Bistro type food. The burgers are juicy, cooked to perfection and tender with every possible topping to make it personalized to your liking. Absolutely the best little little BBQ burger, ribs and pulled pork joint in east downtown Toronto. \" You Gotta Eat Here\"!"}
{"text":"Words can't express how awesome this place is. If you love bbq, look no further. If you want brisket that falls apart when you try to put it on your plate, and a nice variety of sauces to compliment, go here. Organic chicken, they have it.  They might not have everything on the menu available but that's because it's good and everyone orders it, and because it's fresh. The menu... So many good things you can't try them all.. You have to come back because it's impossible to ingest all that is amazing there. Also Mac and 5cheese was surprisingly delicious even as a side  Didn't see anyone leave without a to go bag as portions are generous. Shout out to Nathan our waiter for the night took better then great care of us! See you again soon!"}
{"text":"This Smoke house came across to me as a well known BBQ Restaurant. There is such stiff competition in the GTA for BBQ. So we went. I had the beef brisket Sammy with home made creamy cole slaw & corn bread. The beef was a little tough but was certainly tasty. Coleslaw was lacking taste to a certain extent. Cornbread was good & had a sweet butter with it which was also good. We had the \"burnt tips\" as an appie. This was unique, different & tasty. Fellow restaurant goers had the Pulled Pork Poutine & pork side ribs. Poutine was delicious but the side ribs were tough. I woulda sent them back. Selection of 4 different BBQ sauce a at the table. All in...it was good but not $170.00 good. I wouldn't redo this place. The main reason...the Ribs. If u can't get the Ribs right U can't be a BBQ Smokehouse in my opinion. This says a lot for ribs that were $30.00 for 1 person!?"}
{"text":"I was fortunate enough to get invited to the grand opening event at their new 55 Colborne St. location in November. We were treated to an assortment of menu items throughout the night including wings, steak, ribs, poutine, and pulled pork. Everything was on a different level. I've never been so impressed with smoked meat like I was here that night. I highly recommend their new location at 55 Colborne St. whenevever you're in the area. Seating is fantastic and can accommodate large parties in this rustic venue. Drinks and craft beers are also delicious. My recommendations are the wings and the ribs, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Grew up in the South. Looking for my BBQ fix. That said, I'm comparing this to the best Southern BBQ I've had...Dreamland Tuscaloosa Alabama, Saw's BBQ Birmingham Alabama and The Tired Texan (RIP) Bham Alabama. I'm not expecting miracles, but I am expecting something to get me by, until I can get back to the real deal.   That said, I found Hogtown Smoke perfectly passable, if not pretty darn good.  Ribs...pretty darn close to really good! Juicy and fall off the bone. Not Dreamland, but good enough for me not to want to book a flight to Bama.  Pulled Pork Sandwich... Bun was \"fancy\" but didn't interfere with the taste palate. Nice. Slaw gave good crunch. Pork was really good. Couldn't tell much difference from what I'm used to.  Sauces (all on side, 'cause it's all about the meat y'all)...Mild was perfectly normal and serviceable. Nothing spectacular, but perfectly \"normal\" to my taste. (I added Tobasco, so would probably get the Hot next time). \"BB\" Blueberry and Blackberry? Interesting and not as weird as it sounds. Worked fine on Sandwich, not so much on ribs. Peanut Butter and Chipolte? It's not traditional, but I really dug this.  Fries...really good, but who really cares, right? You can get good fries anywhere that cares these days.  Slaw...good, but needed a punch in there. Pepper? Mustard? I don't know, but it was lacking on its own. Good on sandwich.  Beans...\"Root Beer Baked Beans\" Not your typical taste for these, but I found myself really liking them after I got over the initial confusing taste.  Minuses for me...No Greens! Cornbread but no greens? Did they not get the memo? Get some Collards! Also, no Brunswick Stew! Come on, it's easy once you've got the meat!  I did take out and had no problems.  My go to place for my fix as of now.  I must say though that as with good Mexican in this town, expect to pay at least double as what you'd pay in the South.  Best rack of ribs you'll ever have at Dreamland Tuscaloosa Alabama $19.95. Half-rack here $24. That's ridiculous. Stick with the sandwich.  BTW, it's a Slab not a Rack if you want to be authentic. Also, there are always pickles on Southern BBQ sandwiches. They're cheap, get some.  Go there! It's good."}
{"text":"I'm from the Boston area and I love to try out true BBQ places wherever I travel.   Loved this place!   Kevin (one of the owners) was my server and told me the story of how Hogstown Smoke has progressed from humble beginnings back as a food truck and now they have multiple area locations (and the truck is still running!)   But what about the BBQ?   Burnt ends were as good as you'd hope for.  Melt in your mouth.  Very well executed dish and generous portion.   Kevin told me that the wings were not to be missed and I'm glad I tried them out.   Getting a crisp skin on something smoked takes some effort and Hogtown makes it work.  I'll be back for the wings alone.   I wasn't as floored by the St. Louis ribs - they were fine, but not up to the same quality standards set by the burnt ends and wings.  Those dishes set the bar high!   Beer -- about 6 brews on draft and Kevin was very generous in letting me try a couple before \"committing.\"  I only tried the drafts - not sure if there is much of a bottle selection.  I was more than satisfied with the drafts alone.    I'll be back to this and the other Hogstown locations!   Kevin does a great job as friendly host at this location - happy to visit such a happy place that serves high quality 'cue!"}
{"text":"Mac and cheese was amazing.  Good portions on all orders and a good collection of craft beer to wash it down."}
{"text":"Excellent Service, Great Drinks, Nice venue.  BBQ Fans will be happy."}
{"text":"Great little spot. Food was amazing with great service. My cousin and I were very happy with this place. Definitely going back with more people."}
{"text":"The ribs I ordered was very delicious. They cooked it very well, it had a nice structure, the sauce was super tasty. BUT. I had only one dish, I paid over $20 and I could have ate another same size dish. The portions are too small compare to the price."}
{"text":"Had late lunch to try out their poutine. Good choice ! Poutine was bomb diggidy ! Rib, pulled pork, deep fried pork belly , candied bacon \"marrow\" gravy(didnt taste any marrow) still a good choice, buck for buck. Menu items are on the expensive side.... My girl got the brisket sandy, side of sweet pot and corn muffin, sweet pot was burnt when we got it. Corn bread was crispy and on the dry side. Bread for the brisket was kinda stale. Brisket was thick cut i prefer thinner but it was still good.  Will i come back? Not really came for the poutine thats all."}
{"text":"Surprisingly bland food for a BBQ Joint.  The coleslaw is like having cabbage with a little bit of oil and vinegar.  Not too mention lack of salt and the cabbage is way too thick, so it ends up feeling pretty dry.  Portion sizes are good, but way too much fries and not enough meat on my pulled pork bun.  I don't think I would go back, bbq pork on a bun, fries, coleslaw and a glass of beer, $24, before taxes.  On the high side as far as price and on the low side as far as value."}
{"text":"Been here twice. First time we went it was really excellent. Great service, fantastic food. Second time we arrived there was a new menu and the vibe felt a little different. The quality of the BBQ was definitely not great and the whole thing felt rushed. I'd be hard pressed to return, which is quite sad given how happy I was the first time we went."}
{"text":"Hubby is the real BBQ fan, I like it but have yet to find a place I love here in T dot as much as I love Suzy-Q's in Buffalo.  Hubby says the smoked jalapeño poppers which are wrapped in bacon and smoked deserve 5 stars.    The high prices and small portions deserve 2 stars.  The chilli and smoked sausage deserves 4 stars... The cornbread 3 stars.  The tough and dry ribs and pulled pork 1-2 stars.  Which makes an average 3 stars.  Which makes me say, time for a road trip to Buffalo for ribs and smoked kielbasa sausage at Suzy Q's!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite BBQ and there is no restaurant in the city that I enjoy over-ordering from.  The problem is, there are so many things that I consider to be essential: at least one type of ribs, the brisket, the burnt ends and the wings.  They're all must-haves.  And then the sides!  I can't not get the root beer baked beans, the corn bread, even the fries are exceptional.  But what is really impressive is that even the salads I've tried have been really good.  It would be very easy for this place to just offer some lame salad that requires no effort - just for the sake of having salads on the menu.  But the roasted beet salad (with fennel!) is probably one of my favorite salads in the city.    And I hate beets.  I HATE THEM!  But this salad is probably on my 'must have' list now as well.  For me, no other BBQ place in the city does it for me like this place does.  And the staff have always been very good at explaining and coaching when I've been indecisive.  In fact, stop reading this silly review and just go here.  Any time you spend reading about Hogtown Smoke is taking away from time that could be spent EATING at Hogtown Smoke."}
{"text":"As a vegan I didn't expect there to be ANY options for me but decided to give it a shot. They ended up having a tofu salad (the only option) but hey it was an option at least. It came with kale, roasted chickpeas, raisins and grilled tofu."}
{"text":"Amazing all-around. Hogtown Smoke surpassed my expectations.   My friend and I went on a Thursday evening, cloudy weather and it was basically empty, inside and at the back patio. We decided to dine at the back patio and it looked very unique and cool in its on way. It was filled with neat high tables and high chairs with a bar at the back. You'll kinda wish your backyard looked the same way. Even though we didn't stay inside, it looked very cozy and cool with their neat booths and blackboard wall menu.   We were greeted and served by a very sweet and cool lady who was very helpful throughout our dining experience. She asked us if it was our first time at Hogtown Smoke and then she told us about their menu, especially their \"Create Your Own Platter\", which I got. Throughout our dining experience, we were checked up upon a couple other employees, not only her, I gratefully appreciated that. All of them were very cool, joyful, and nice and they definitely made me feel welcomed.  On our table were many condiments and other things such as ketchup, mustard, vinegar, moist toilettes, and three of their signature sauces: Black + Blue (Nice and sweet), Hogfather (best of 3), and Mango Habanero (very strong). Throughout my dining experience at Hogtown Smoke, I mostly used Hogfather and then Black + Blue, they both complimented my dishes significantly.   I ordered a Platter of Burnt Ends, Back Ribs, and Brisket with a side of Sweet Potato Fries. The Sweet Potato Fries came with Chipotle Mayo and it tasted great. The three meats were both beyond succulent, very tender and juicy.  By far the best quality BBQ I have tasted. I loved how the three meats tasted with the Hogfather sauce. Also, these three meats were recommended by our server and she was definitely right.  In the end, we were very full and I ended up taking my leftovers out. A platter is definitely good enough for 2 people.   Overall, food had the highest quality, staff was amazing and fun, and decor was cool and unique.  Everything was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've been to Hogtown Smoke, but the food has improved since I was last there. The most notable change is you now only get one side when you order a sandwich, but the focus is where it should be, on the sandwich itself. The portion of pulled pork is now much more generous, and was also tender and quite tasty. Definitely a step up from what they used to be serving."}
{"text":"Great food and service! The beans are to die for! Especially if you enjoy Rootbeer! Good music, not too noisy and amazing food and service! What more can you ask for??"}
{"text":"Visited on a whim and left a fan! Had the brussel sprouts wrapped in bacon (highly recommend) and shared a platter of Burnt Ends, Smoked Bird Wings, St Louis Bones (Ribs), and Mac N Cheese. The platter was definitely the best call as it let us try a number of different things. The meats were amazing and all of the sauces complimented eveything very well. Service was also very friendly and attentive. It's not a fancy place, and it's also not cheap ($40/person with soft drinks) but the price was worth it considering the quality and taste. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Rib is not as juicy but the meat is well flavored and cooked to perfect. Got the brisket and it's super soft and juicy. Wings are well flavored too. I like to dip all of them with hog mother sauce and raspberry sauce. Never goes wrong."}
{"text":"Overrated, overpriced, over complicated and underwhelming. The brisket was dry and relatively tough (compared to good barbecue). The menu is ridiculously complicated and there are too many rules! Clearly this place is about making money and not about satisfying their customers' requests. And the cost of what you get is completely over the top. With so many good barbecue joints in Toronto these days there is no need to go to this one."}
{"text":"If you don't like to eat alone this is the place for you. Around 8:30 finished our meals with my date and we asked for the  bill. We noticed a brave mouse out on the floor while there was still at least 3 tables of patrons. Obviously this freaked me out and the waitress noticed me freaked out and came over and asked if everything was ok. I told her there's a brave mouse in the house  and her reply was that they come in from the back door that is left open. Was my favourite place for smoked meat but if there's mice out while we are eating, I can't imagine what happens when they are closed. City health inspectors need to check this place out and fix the rodent problem. Also the waitress told me all the places in the beaches area have a rodent problem, I beg to differ I've lived in the area my whole life. I hate excuses and was so grossed out we will never go back."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here on a very hot day. We saw their sign for \"water mist technology\" on the patio and decided to check it out to cool off. They didn't have it on but turned it on for us. Really friendly service! Our server Taurean was patient and really helpful. I was so undecided and he patiently helped me out. The food and drinks turned out to be amazing thanks to his help! He helped me pick out the perfect beer to go with my dish. We loved it and plan to come back. I had poutine with the pulled pork on the side. Delicious! My friend had the pulled pork sandwich with a fresh bun. She doesn't usually like bread but she loved this! What a good find. I am not even that into pork or ribs but we were so pleasantly surprised! I also hope when we come back that we will have the same server. He was terrific."}
{"text":"No, no, no. Allow me to describe why this place is not worth your time and money. -The brisket didn't have a smoke ring, which means it wasn't cooked correctly in the smoker. That's a huge red flag for BBQ. -The brisket doesn't have a crust on it for flavor. That's to be expected at any legit BBQ place. -A rack of ribs is $50. That's beyond absurd. There is no BBQ meat in the world that justifies that cost.  -The portions are unnecessarily small. Three slices of brisket on a brisket sandwich is just unheard of. -The biggest problem with this place is the fact that they had brisket available when they opened, but they claimed that the burnt ends wouldn't be available for three more hours. This is impossible. Burnt ends are typically cut off the brisket, diced and then placed back into the smoker for 1-2 hours. Since they wouldn't have any available for at least 3 hours (missing all of the lunch rush), this means that separate pieces of brisket were used entirely for burnt ends.   Stay away."}
{"text":"I have now purchased food twice from this establishment.   The food is good and BBQ is flavourful - however, the portions are far too small for the cost. My wife and I ordered pulled pork and a brisket our first time. We were shocked by how little meat there was, especially in the brisket.  The second time we ordered the glutton-free meat sample for two - at $70, we were expecting 2+ meals for us both. Instead we enjoyed one meal (with, again, the brisket coming in at a very small quantity) and have just enough left over for one of us.  Bottom line - if you crave good tasting BBQ it's probably worth a visit, but you aren't going to get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Typical \"foodie\" joint! Good beer ($8) but NO beans in the chili, just canned tomatoes and tender meat chunks. Friendly service, but rather pricey for common fare."}
{"text":"Let me say that this place is amazing. The service was exquisite and the staff are amazing. When I arrived the hostess told me there would a delay since a fire alarm went off in the kitchen.   I was expecting a long delay however they brought my order to my table in a reasonable amount of time. The waitress was efficient and very friendly. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Went back...  We ordered a full rack of the baby back ribs again. So we got two slabs with seven or so bones each. One slab was perfect. Really thick... and moist... with the perfect amount of BBQ sauce. The other slab was not quite as thick and a little dry.  We also ordered a couple sides of mac n cheese. This really is THE best mac n cheese I've ever had! If anyone knows where I can get better mac n cheese, please let me know but I really don't think it gets any better than this."}
{"text":"Amazing! A little pricey but you highly recommended. I'm comatose full even though I only had a sandwich. Service was also great and the decor is well suited. The pig out had my fave brisket until I tried this place so definitely a new fave!"}
{"text":"This is my third or fourth time here. The ribs are great, drinks  very good too. And Ashlee's service was friendly and attentive. We sat on the back patio, the only issue was it was a but cool in the evening. Someday I will try the chicken."}
{"text":"It was ok Very relaxed Service was slowish but very friendly and thoughtful. The lighting is bright and the seating is hard, if your own rule is we might be slow then make it really comfortable My friends burger was apparently juicy and good, but my baby back ribs $30- were dry - seems to me in this joint this item should be perfect- and the sauce was kind of predictable and seemed to be -not infused- but added later, sweet, a bit spicy - not sure if there was a dry rub, the meat wAs dry n crusty with red based sauce on it, but not exceptional.  I can do better at home-which is my bar as an amateur  They seem hung up about; slow cook,BBQ, limited quantity, running out, perhaps take all your awesome waste and make a great SW spicey black bean soup and add that to the over priced apps - recycle but don't limit the consumers experience of supply and timeliness  I would call it expensive - and I can go deep in places that cost a lot, but not sure the value met the price. The only glass of red wine offered was $18/ 8 oz - a mason jar style-odd- the rest of the list was out I might come back Cause I love BBQ and I believe they do too"}
