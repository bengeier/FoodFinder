{"text":"Their wraps are very generous and thick. It's a very healthy place to eat if you want to eat healthy. They only have whole wheat wraps no white wraps at all. The menu can be confusing since you have to \"put together\" what you want to eat? The price for the wrap sandwich is rather pricey in my opinion. They do have \"to go\" salads as well in cups if you want.   It's a good place to go if you are a vegetarian and want only veggies or wraps. My daughter doesn't eat meat so she loves that place since they make it her way.   It does take a while for your food to be ready and you have to wait a bit. It's pricy there but I would go once a while if I want to eat something healthy or in the mood for veggies/greens."}
{"text":"love chopped leaf as it is a healthy option and tasty! the only thing is... it's pricey. i guess that's the cost of eating healthy these days. i've had the avocado forgotten on my sunshine salad more than once, but i usually have some i can throw on at home so whatever. the chopped water is pretty good too."}
{"text":"LOVE this place !! So nice to have a healthy alternative to a quick meal in Airdrie. The food is fantastic and the staff & owners are super nice and helpful. Quality is amazing. I am addicted. I've been twice this week since I found it and will definitely be a regular with all the yummy choices. :)"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner tonight and was very disappointed for the third time! Ingredients were not fresh... my avocado in my salad was brown and mushy and the lettuce was rusty. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"Bowls - whether it be poke, salad bowls, or even Greek bowls - are really starting to be a trend!  Being a fan of lunch bowls, I decided to try the Chopped Leaf in Airdrie for a quick late lunch after work.  I've been here twice and really like the fresh meals here!  Atmosphere: 4/5  Conveniently located within a mall; overall spacious and clean.  I've only gotten take out here and in general, it had not been too busy - usually 1-2 tables during the times I've been here  Food: 4/5  I tried the pegasus with grilled chicken and sunshine with tuna, both of which were very good.  Ingredients were fresh and the combination with protein made both salads healthy and satisfying.  good portion size and I like the pita that came with it. There was also an option to create your own bowls but that came with less variety of ingredients for the same price.  Price: 3/5  To be honest - I would consider the bowls to be on the more expensive side as one can likely make the same salads for a much lower cost at home.  I suppose the variety and convenience partially makes up for it  Service: 3/5  Overall friendly, however the wait was longer than I expected given the number of staff working relative to customers.  There is, however, the option to pre-order online which may cut down the wait time.  Overall: 3.5/5  Overall a good option for a quick fresh meal - I would come again to try some of their other options like rice bowls, sandwiches or cups."}
{"text":"Airdrie has a few surprises considering it's status as a bedroom community for Calgary, and a healthy fast-food place is among them. Welcome to The Chopped Leaf.  The Chopped Leaf has been around for a little over a year now, and it's one of the places I enjoy in town because of it's quality - even though it's a place to grab a fast lunch, the quality control here is huge. Each time I come back, the food is always fresh and presented in a very appetizing manner.   If you're new to this place, it's a bit confusing: the menu consists of soups, salads, sandwiches,  whole bowls, and wraps. The salads and wraps can be ordered from the pre-set menu, or you can build your own, with each addition increasing the cost (think of it like a pizza place where you get a few base ingredients and everything else is extra). All of the options are vegetarian to start, and you add a few bucks for protein choices as well. Once you order, you pay and get a number, and take a seat...at rush, expect to wait up to 10 minutes for your food to be prepared, even if you're just getting something that you might think is simple.   As mentioned, the food comes out looking great all the time - the only time I've ever not had something \"pretty\" was when I ordered a salad to-go, and they accidentally put it in a bowl before transferring it to a take-out container... it was still excellent, just a bit jumbled.   If I had to pick out a few flaws, it would be the cost and the wait times. Yes, the quality is really good, but I'm not sure  if it justifies the cost entirely. A full-sized salad, with protein and a drink will probably land you around $15, which is a bit steep for something I'd consider to be fast food. The pricing is a bit deceptive too, since I personally prefer some meat in my meals, and it's a minimum of a $2 charge to add any of that to any option on the menu. The wait time is the other problem - I want to call  this a fast-food place since there's no servers to take your order, but the waiting times can be a bit prohibitive if you have less than an hour for lunch. As the line can stretch pretty long at peak hours, you shouldn't plan on it being quick. There is the option to order ahead, but I'd rather drop by and see if I can get in and out quick.   The short of things? Great food,  fantastic flavours, a bit pricey and a bit slow. The perfect stop for someone trying to eat a bit cleaner, but maybe try the Subway (in the same parking lot) if you're looking for a fast or cheap bite in the area."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, delicious and friendly! Can't be beat. One of the things I love most is that when I order one of their pre designed salads of I ask for no *insert topping here* they always offer something in its place for free! And their chopped water is always delicious and refreshing!"}
{"text":"It was my first time at Chopped leaf, staff were really helpful and explained everything. healthy varieties, and great taste."}
{"text":"Delicious! I've eaten here several times, tried most of their soups and salads, and have not been disappointed yet! Always fresh and amazing, the flavours are fantastic! The food is so good I crave it constantly!   However, I do find it rather pricey. A small soup & salad runs me just over $14 which, at that price, you could have a much more substantial meal just about anywhere. It is definitely worth it, but I would probably eat there more often if it was a little less. I feel like a bit of a dope paying that much for a small soup & salad, and unfortunately for their business, it inspires me to try and recreate their recipes at home.  Also, for a healthy \"fast-food\" joint is isn't very fast. I've had to wait in long line ups, and then again to receive my order, many times."}
{"text":"So glad there is a healthy fast food option besides a pita place. Small but varied menu. Several vegetarian and vegan items or substitutions. Fast and super fresh. I especially love the brown rice bowls. Custom ordering is never a problem (asking for no onions... or whatever) is never a problem because they make everything right when you order. Never had a bad experience.  Their fruit infused water is a must try. Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is the menu is fairly small.  But it's a small place so that's sort of expected. The owner is also really nice and informative about the menu and how they do things."}
{"text":"Love that you can design your own salads and the soups are really tasty.  Good for vegetarians.  My kids love it too, and its healthy.  Great lunch option."}
