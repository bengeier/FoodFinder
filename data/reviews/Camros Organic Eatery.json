{"text":"If I was a vegetarian, I would probably give it 4-stars because the food is very good for vegetarian, gluten-free. The reason it gets 3-stars is because I do eat meat, and this place is very expensive considering there's no meat involved. 

I got 2 dishes, which ended up costing me $9 with tax. I was still a little hungry afterwards, but I just couldn't handle paying more than $10 for vegetables and chickpeas. 

The quinoa salad and chickpea curry with coconut milk I ate were very good. There were a variety of dishes to choose from, and a soup of the day. The soup the day I went, was borscht for the beet lovers out there. 

There are a lot of tables and large windows, so there's a lot of light. A nice place to eat with pleasant staff."}
{"text":"Food was good. Casual atmosphere. Clean. 
Only problem I had was that the food was somewhat cold when I got it but he quickly heated it up and gave my some extra beans for the trouble
I would go back. 
I enjoyed the food and I felt good  after eating there.
lots of gluten free and vegan options."}
{"text":"So good! I've never been an organic/super healthy person but I tried Camros one day with a friend who only eats organic and I wopuld go back! I had chickpeas, a salad and a brownie all of which were pretty good."}
{"text":"Great , wholesome food! 
Some reviews are complaining about the prices , but this quality of fresh, organic food isn't cheap !"}
{"text":"I'm happy an old colleague told me about this place, or I would never have stumbled on it. It's great for vegetarians and gluten-free (for the most part I believe). 

You know what's in your food, it's light, lightly seasoned and very healthy. It is a little expensive for lunch, but again - you know what's in your food. 

It's a saviour if your vegetarian or have any allergies. Service is friendly, and it's a quiet retreat if your sitting-in."}
{"text":"I won't go back on principle. The food is fresh and carefully made, however the pricing system is ridiculous. For a full plate of food with \"4 items\" you're looking at about $14.00, which I suppose is worth it because it is organic and a full plate. However if you only want an appetizer size item regardless of what it is they charge the \"one item\" rate.. I ordered a small vegetarian patty of some sort which wasn't very big or remarkable and was charged $6.60 after tax, I was shocked when I got to the cash, the guy explained that the rate goes down if you order more items. It felt like I was being punished with an insane price for something that was in my opinion not of relevant value, just because I didn't order more items. It was no larger than a crab cake and served from a hot table, it's the not a full service place so can't even be justified by ambiance...it's the kind of place where you put your tray away before you leave. Also they have a very limited and boring selection of dessert items. Even if I did frequent the place, I'd get bored of the menu in no time."}
{"text":"Used to be good.....really downill. After getting back from a year trip, I was craving Camros. A 3km walk, and a picnic planned, I was so excited! 
But after getting served ice-cold stew (still chunks of ice in it), potatoes and lentils were actually french fries in lentils, and carrots delivered from the US (October-our harvest season) I see Camros has lost its way. So sad. When I called them, the supervisor was so rude but did promise to replace the stew. When I went in, he accused me of lying and wanted my personal information. 
It was all around a bad experience."}
{"text":"The stew hit the spot and the staff we're wonderful. I also really loved the eco friendly takeout containers my only issue was how expensive it was. A side of stew, salad and some rice with a small lentil rice ball cost me more than 17$ - also there was a little too much salt in the stew even though it was still really good I wish it was a little less sodium rich."}
{"text":"been here a few times, the food is well seasoned and always fresh but the portions can sometimes be a bit ridiculous (taking into account the fact that everything is organic). it has been my experience that when the owner is in i will eat a normal sized meal, but some of the employees can be less than generous. this is the first time i have encountered a problem with portion size and i don't eat copious amounts in one sitting, but as a vegetarian it takes more than a small plate to feel nourished. today, i literally got two tablespoons of rice and a bit of kale, for which i paid $10. it's not a lot of money, but it's irritating to be served that as a meal. so, either lower your prices or by all means raise them, but please remember that people are coming in for a meal, not an appetizer."}
{"text":"Me and my hubby take Spanish classes near Camros, so every few days a week we stop there for lunch. I'm so happy we had discovered this little gem. 

The restaurant is very simple, yet cozy, perfect for lunch. 
The food is organic and vegan. I believe most of the dishes if not all , are also gluten free, which is AMAZING. The girls who work there are very sweet and polite. 

The food is super delicious...every time we are there, we try something new and new flavours are constantly introduced to our palettes. The food tastes like homemade food, freshly prepared. I am definitely a fan of this place and I wish there will be more restaurant like this in the future:)"}
{"text":"Indeed - vegetarian food at its best!!

I have been here a few times and have enjoyed the food each time. Everything is so tasty, fresh and healthy, I feel my body thanking me all day.

I always enjoy the kale salad and Rice balls.  The staff is always so warm and friendly as well.

This place is quite far from my work and my home, but somehow I try to make it out here as often as I can.

I only wish they were open later in the evening."}
{"text":"So I have been back a couple times for a meal since the first time. I definitely enjoy their food. It tastes great, and it makes you feel great.

If I have a complaint it's that I don't really feel full for long after eating here. Even when I've spent $15 on the four-dish combo, I was still hungry a little over an hour later. I feel that I'd have to top it off with a cookie/brownie/cake of some kind, which would mean spending $20 or more on lunch, and for me eating healthy also means skipping the sweet stuff, so it would defeat the purpose in a way.

Nevertheless, I will continue to come to Camros, because a) I support what they are doing, b) the food IS good, and c) it's the only real food in the yonge-bloor area (since Simply Zoup closed down)."}
{"text":"Looking for a restaurant that offers good vegetarian/vegan options instead of fries or anything loaded with cheese and bell peppers is hard. After reading the reviews on Camros I decided to give it a try.

 I stopped in last week to get a two item combo and the guy behind the counter (the staff looked really happy, I felt like I should apply to work there) recommended the green stew plus kale salad with the tahini. I was delighted to see them use those new trendy recycled take out boxes and these awesome wooden sporks. I love the sporks!! 

My meal was deliciously hearty and I wasn't able to finish it all at once - the stew was very filling. I felt so satisfied for a few hours and plan to go back and try the rice balls which looked really good.. Also the vegan coconut fig bar I was eyeing..

Overall first impression earned them five stars.

P.s. 
Yes, it's a bit pricey but unfortunately what's healthy for you doesn't come in a value meal combo where you can super size it for a buck fifty extra. Once a week or every couple weeks at this place is a good treat for your body."}
{"text":"Eating healthy is good; and it's good for you.  The food at Camros is the type of food you try to make yourself; but you overcook your lentils (making it into a soup instead because it's already gone to mush) and most of it might end up tasting like cardboard because you don't know how to season it properly.  But their quinoi still looks like quinoi after it's been made into a salad and their seasoning is light and healthy.

Don't mistaken this for a dine-in place.  It's an over-the-counter eatery and by six or so at night, most of the food is already gone.  Damn you healthy people for eating all the food before six!"}
{"text":"Love this place, I am almost there everday for lunch, the food is incredible and made with love, staff is great and i always feel at home."}
{"text":"Not many things can top the feeling of going out for food and feeling 10x healthier because you did (...other than perhaps being stupidly drunk and having poutine with extra cheese curds - that's the opposite extreme).

The first time I came here was just before closing on a Friday night, so they were running low on selections. Without having much of a choice, I had gotten the chick pea stew, kale salad, red patty, and a vegetable stew. I really loved vegetable stew and the kale salad.

I was able to drop by during lunch time today and I was able to choose from their other options. This time, I opted for the soup of the day (celery? it was very average, IMO), lentil stew, red cabbage salad and the lentil patty. Again, the salad was yum - I think it is mainly because I am a fan of their zesty lemon dressing. I would also recommend the lentil patty to everyone. Super flavourful (mildly curry) - way better than the red one.

With the soup and 3 items, it came to about $18 which actually seems like a miscalculation, considering soup + 2 items is listed on their board as $12-something. Anyway, we split between two people and I would say it's a small, healthy portion for lunch.

Amazing service both times. Their staff is extremely friendly. Atmosphere is not bad - had more seating space than I had expected! And conveniently located right outside of the Yonge/Bloor Hayden St exit!

Atmosphere - 3/5
Service - 5/5
Food - 4/5

{"text":"Oh the lunch habits of office workers. I try to bring my lunch every day, but considering I have an entire list of (mostly) lunch options within 5 min of my office (see http://www.yelp.ca/list/yonge-and-bloor-reviews-toronto) I guess its fair to say that on a fairly regular occasion, I am left choosing a place to grab a quick meal. And with a Yelp sign right on the front door, how can you resist popping in for a bite. 

Camros is obviously the healthiest choice in the neighborhood, 100% organic, delicious, hearty and flavorful, with (approximately) 10 items to choose from at a time. I go for a three item combo, splitting one into a dahl/brown rice and then two salads. This combo comes to $12 and small change which may seem expensive, but is still cheaper than Longo's famous $14-on-average salad bar and a vegetarian take out sushi from Asahi just down the street.

Their menu claims that in addition to all of this wonderfulness, they also support sustainable organic agricultural practices. 

On top of that they have biodegradable containers and straws as default, unlike Longo's  who still uses the non-recyclable plastic ones. (grr) They also don't price by weight, meaning $14 Greek salad and fruit won't happen at the cash. (grr x 2) Additionally, their salads are made fresh with high quality natural ingredients, meaning the Millet salad here tastes like olive oil and lemon, and not strangely chemically  (/hate on Longo's)

Any vegetarian used to beans/grains will be full after this much food. Meat eaters may want to load up on the denser offerings like legumes. Really high quality veggie food, good value, friendly service and no additives/chemicals/tremendous waste and the other surprises that come with fast food selections. 

They take all methods of payment."}
{"text":"Camros is a great little place for healthy, guilt free and whole food take out. If you need something good for you on the go and you're in the neighbourhood this is the place."}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing! Persian-based cuisine that is organic, vegan, gluten-free, and absolutely delicious!!! Upon entering the place, I had a great vibe because it is so comfy and clean. It just felt good to be there! The head chef Mojdeh was the one who served me and I found her very friendly and knowledgeable. What a gem this place is! I plan to return to Camros as often as I can :D"}
{"text":"The best, healthiest and tastiest lunch spot in the Yonge-Bloor area... and right up there with the best in town.  Proves that organic, vegetarian and healthy doesn't have to taste like cardboard. Short menu, but lots of variety from week to week. Camros takes the approach of making a few really great dishes, rather than putting out a huge buffet of mediocrity à la Green Mango."}
{"text":"Not only do you feel great after eating here, but you feel like you've stumbled upon some sort of health secret.

100% organic vegetarian cuisine that actually has flavor!
You just can't get enough.  Who would have thought that eating your vegetables could be so much fun!

They rotate the menu weekly to keep things interesting.  Lentil/chickpea strews, rice balls, unique salads topped with organic dressings (tahini or zesty lemon).  Some of their popular items sell out early! (Eg. Kale salad, how you elude me).  Giant flourless cookies, double-layer chocolate brownies..everything is so tasty!

I order the 2 item combo...which you can actually ask for as half-half.
1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 4 delicious items! (Except the rice ball which is 1 item)

Biodegradable containers, this place is good for your body and good for the environment!

I can't wait for my next lunch at Camros!"}
{"text":"Oh my god I am SO jealous of you Toronto! On my first ever visit to this fine city, I wanted to grab a late lunchie after just arriving off the plane. While I've always been strictly into organic and local when I can, I've recently been trying a no meat thang and Camros popped up in my nearby search for salads. The reviews looked great so off I sped.

This place was even better than I could have hoped for. Definitely off the beaten path, but bright, clean and new with handy chalkboards detailing the day's menu plus all the ingredients in every dish. I sneakily listened to how the peeps in front of me were ordering from the buffet (you tell em if you're eating in or out, how many items and then which ones), and then got down to business: I HAD to get the rice balls which are essentially brown rice buns stuffed full of spiced currents and raisins with an onion sauce. I also got the lima bean stew with fresh dill, the millet salad with chickpeas and the already raved about kale salad (which I concur with the accolades and would like double next time). They also offer freshly squeezed lemon juice and a tahini sauce which I also got (duh)

Not to sound dramatic, but this is literally one of the best meals I've had in a long time and really goes to show how supporting local and seasonal produce and, yes this is going to be cheesy, but a little bit of care and love can impact a dish. Even if you aren't a veggie or a vegan, you should definitely hit up Camros for a try. I think it would change your definition of \"health food.\"

In the meantime, Camros, can you come to New York? Please...?"}
{"text":"This is my second review of camros as I come often.  I have revised it down from 4 to 3.

The sole reason for this is the very rude service I continue to get.  The girl in the green bandana is one of rudest servers I have ever encountered. 

For a place that espouses well being and is otherwise quite peaceful I don't know why everyone working her is seemingly always pissed off."}
{"text":"I find the food inconsistent. Once it was too salty, the next bland and the rice ball dry.  There won't be a third time."}
{"text":"I think the food here is the main pro (hearty, varied, flavourful), followed by the service (friendy and helpful). I was in about 45 minutes before close, so I don't think I had as much choice as a lunch crowd might - but the food was still pretty good! The bean stew (midnight stew, I believe it was called?) was outstanding - flavours and textures were perfectly used for a hearty snack. I also tried a lentil pattie (which was sadly a bit dry) and the green and refreshing kale salad (with tahini dressing). 

Camros - unlike places such as Kale and Le Commensal - doesn't do their buffet by weight, but by item. This means you can hoof down the heartiest of meals without worrying about getting weighed down by pesky carbs (at the cash register, anyhow!). I think next time when I select 1 or 2 items (1 item = two scoops of a dish) i'll go for the heavier, substantial stuff and leave the salad for elsewhere to get the most out of my money.

For me, the location is a bit out of the way - and the hours are a bit restrictive too. I guess they serve a lot of folks who work in the area, but i'd be inclined to pop in on weekends if I could. If it were slightly more convenient and just a *little* less pricey (still better value than by-weight places, I believe) then you'd get a 4th star out of me. Don't let this dissuade you from trying their flavourful delights!"}
{"text":"Camros is a rare find in the city - 100% vegetarian menu that is healthy, tasty, and nearly 100% organic items (I believe that on the off chance an item is not organic, they will alert you as such but that it's happening quite rarely these days). The food has quite subtle flavours yet still manages to be delicious - two of my favourite items are their kale salad and their rice balls. The staff is friendly and helpful and I feel really good about supporting a family-owned business. When I first started going here, it seemed that one of the owners was almost always there and both of them are incredibly nice and friendly and were happy to answer any questions and make recommendations.

As everyone else has said, it may prove difficult to just stumble upon this place due its location next to a parking garage off Yonge street but it's worth a special trip down Hayden avenue. 

Also, HUGE props to Camros for having 100% biodegradable take out containers and cutlery and encouraging people to use plates and real silverware when eatin n the restaurant. 

I highly recommend checking it out - I don't think you'll find better healthy take-out anywhere in the city."}
{"text":"The food is tasty enough, but it isn't worth it for the price (organic or not.. there are many other places that use organic ingredients for similar prices and they are not this cheap with portion size!). I ordered a 2 option combo today which costs a bit over $10 + tax. They use the small type of takeout container and they only fill it about half full(!) which is ridiculous. I had the lentil dahl with the rice (they said 1/2 portion of each can be considered 1 option) and the millet salad. What I don't get is why they call it a \"combo\" when it is basically two items of anything - and that salad and rice are also considered as the options you can pick. Most \"combos\" at most other restaurants include salad and/or rice, and you get to pick 2 mains. Once I realized what little food I would be getting, I felt too under pressure/nice to cancel my order so I just paid for it. The tiny portion size isn't fair to the customer for this price. I was still hungry after and had to buy something else to eat from another business.. but because I already spent my lunch money here, I could only spend $3 more later somewhere else. It was definitely not worth the price and I don't plan to return. I think it was probably only about 1 cup of food in total (a few tbsp of each dish).

I notice other reviews say the same thing (pricey for what you get, small portion sizes). I suspect this is the reason their restaurant is often pretty empty or only has a few people, when this kind of healthy food is very popular in Toronto. I bet if they didn't cheap out so much on the food, they might balance their finances through selling more food because of more people coming in to eat. People want a place like this for lunch, but not when you leave still feeling hungry and it was your lunch break (your one chance to eat for the work day) or that you did not get a fair amount of food for the price. That is the reason I won't return - not because of the taste of the food.

Nov 15th edit: I wish the owners would open up their minds and ears and listen to what people are saying. If multiple people have said the portion size is too small for the cost, then it should be something you think about. This is likely why your restaurant is so empty most of the time. We are just trying to help give you honest feedback so your business can get better and draw more satisfied customers - listen instead of getting defensive!! If you want to charge this much for this little food, then you need to change the look and service of your restaurant: it will need to be a proper  sit down restaurant with table service, and nicer plating. Only then will people be okay with the price for the tiny portions, organic or not, tasty or not! For cafeteria style service, with pre-cooked food under glass, the portion size is NOT WORTH THE PRICE. Listen to your (ex) customers! I will not be returning here because it is a rip-off."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to be fair and downgrade. 
Ordered from Camros online today and was very disappointed. For $16.50 (plus a $6.95 delivery fee) the 4- item combo meal was chintzy and sub-par at best. 
The garam masala 'stew' was a sickly sweet brown sludge slopped into the corner of their biodegradable container.    Saffron brown rice was hard and appeared to be undercooked. I was later made aware that it was actually just stale. Much better. The zucchini rice roll was quite tasty. But there was only one. And that made me quite sad. Quinoa and millet salad lacked dressing. Sigh. 
Needless to say, I will not be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"[Mean Staff] What a shock today, Monday oct 28 :( I eat here a lot, and food is great. But today I came at the end of the night (with 20 min to close) .. And asked for 3 item. the lady put the kale salad last and just one heap which surprised me the quantity. Like half item. I get it every time and know how much is put, even by her.  So I asked her politely to add just a little more. Like two leaves who cares... It's end of the night - no customers after me at that time.  (and I was there 30 minutes prior to buy a juice for 6.75$ small from that same girl told her I'd come back). THE AMOUNT OF ATTITUDE I received from her was ridiculous. And I'm pregnant - so it took a lot of self control not to argue with her in front of my mom who was with me.  She said sarcastically \"so that means you want 4 item\".. And she looked so angry and said: yes other people put different quantities - but that's how much *I* put and I've been doing it the longest. and no word after that. not thanks - not goodbye. Completely rude.

Very hostile and made me feel really bad. Enough to write a review . Not the kind of service you expect from an organic place that prides itself on being \"happy place and food\" .  Even one little piece of lettuce would be enough for effort... I live next door so I come very often and now it will never be the same...  Moral of the story: don't you dare ask for anything to the staff - she may hit you with a stick or stare at you till you melt. Maybe it's Halloween.  I feel really hurt."}
{"text":"wow! 

i'm used to compromising my fastidiously healthy eating habits a bit when i travel, especially when i'm staying in downtown city centers during work travel. i was pleasantly surprised to find this little gem less than two blocks from my company's office in downtown toronto.

you choose individual items here from a food bar, and the choice was difficult because everything looked amazing. i ended up with brown rice, millet salad, green stew and a potato patty w/ fresh tomato sauce.

everything was amazingly fresh, and SO tasty. i especially loved the great use of fresh herbs in the millet salad (parsley) and green stew (dill). 

considering that everything is organic, the prices are pretty reasonable, and i found the portion size to be perfect for a satisfying lunch.

great service too!"}
{"text":"I came here for a 3rd time to give it one last chance.  

I had the combo, which the yellow stew and the green stew (no idea what either were called) with the saffron rice. It costs $14.50 including tax.  I think it was $12.50 or something before tax.

While I thought the food was pretty good, my biggest pet peeve is how chintzy they are.  A two item combo costs $9.95 (before tax), yet the rice counts as an item.  Like really?  So if you get a two item combo, you are paying almost $5.00 for two scoops of rice that costs less than $1 probably.  That's a huge markup.  If you look at my previous review for this place, it was also another chintzy thing that annoyed me.  

While I would probably give the food 3 stars, the pricing of this place makes it lose a star.  I'm sorry Camros, while I love your concept, it's way too pricey and I can't afford you.  :-("}
{"text":"Great, healthy food options here! I love the stews, the kale salad, and the different lentil balls they have daily. The smells are always fragrant too. The service is sometimes not the best (sometimes the staff is a bit moody/awkward) but overall, it's is a great spot."}

It's like the best little organic, dietary-safe cafeteria you could hope for."}
{"text":"Since I joined Yelp I've been overwhelmed by tempting restaurants and cafes serving... Let's just say, it's been a one-way ticket to delicious hell. So for the odd day in a month that I actually crave something healthy when I'm out, Camros is probably the only place I'd venture back into. 

As soon as I entered, it took me back to Portland, in that 'we're-not-a-cult-but-we-own-the-health-game-like-it's-nobody's-business' kinda way. The service is a-MAZING. The Ms. behind the counter walked us through the process and was extremely helpful. 

I ordered 2 items plus soup: Cauliflower soup, quinoa and kale salad. It was amazing, though next time I'll skip cauliflower soup for something a little more hearty, as the other dishes looked extremely tempting in comparison. The prices are totally reasonable, especially for the fresh juice and I'd come back here for lunch or dinner, especially when I'm in the area. 

Too bad they close (relatively) early."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS

This is a cute little place that is located yonge/bloor area and is perfect for a quick healthy meal.  You can do combo meals (not sure if the selection changes).  I had the kale salad, saffron rice and a veggie patty.  All were delicious but a bit pricey.  I think my total came to just over $15.  I understand it's a small business and some of the food items are more expensive, but I wouldn't be able to afford to eat here all the time - but I love the Persian flair.

There are a few tables to sit at and enjoy your meal so if you feel you have eaten poorly in the last few days, come here to re-charge your system!"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian but I must say that I really enjoyed the food they had here. Actually I really liked their salads more than their actual food, which really had next to no Persian influence for as much as I could tell (except the Adasi Polo).

Everything is completely organic, from the drinks to food to snacks (organic hemp bars?) and actually tastes really good. The price isn't too bad either, I was fairly filled up by 3 items, and you can mix it up with a lot of their items (half a serving item so really you can try 6 items!). 

Service was really good, they're really nice people working there but I just had to take that one star off since I personally didn't find many Persian influence in \"vegetable stew\" or beans and chickpeas"}
{"text":"Not a vegetarian but this place really appeals to me.  Rotating menu, excellent kale salad.  Lot of tasty items on the menu.  Only complaint; expensive.  I feel it's overpriced, I would go more often if more affordable."}
{"text":"Delicious whole food fast. Amazing place for lunch when you are downtown.  I love the rotating menu. Staff are lovely and sincere too :) try the Marsala stew."}
{"text":"it is highly unlikely youll ever stumble upon this place by just walking the streets, which is unfortunate because its really quite lovely, peaceful and tasty.  it lies on hayden street which is 1 block southeast of yonge and bloor and right now its kinda blocked by all this construction thats going on around it, so search it out.  i was there a month ago and it was much smaller, and since then theyve taken over the space beside them and redesigned the setup and it feels pure.  Like the wood of the chairs has not been stained at all seemingly.  there are lively plants around, and the space feels open perhaps because of the warm colour of the walls and the large windows facing the street.  you can park yourself on a stool at the window or on a table or if youre lucky on the corner padded bench and coffee table.  

theres no way you can feel bad about anything you are eating here.  Camros is a family owned persian restaurant that was started from the family's need  to be better to their bodies.  eating their food teaches you that there is wonder and delight in foods that are actually better for the body.  a popular item, for example, is the Golden Rice Ball which is basmati brown rice ball stuffed with saffron, cinnamon and raisins and walnuts or something similar called the Green Rice Ball stuffed with plums.  I had one today that perhaps wasnt exactly either of the above two but had prunes in it.  now you can be sure that my face would normally cringe like yours just did at the mention of prunes, but it was real (as opposed to tasting like chemicals) in taste, and fresh in texture and delicious.  the daal lentil is great, tender chick pea stew and the raw kale salad.  the food changes often from week to week to allow for consistency in fresh local food.   its set up cafeteria style, and you pick a combo of dishes.  in other words, decide whether youd like a  2,3 or 4 item plate and then choose whatever you like.  the more you get the cheaper it is per item.  its about 11 bucks for four items and though that might sound a bit much for lunch lets say, know that it is worth it not only because of the taste, but also because you are what you eat and you will be eating the right stuff to give you the right ample energy you need to live well,happily and be productive in a positive way, all the more vital if you are stuck in an office all day.  you can also be comforted by the fact that all of their packaging and take away utensils are biodegradable."}

{"text":"Awesome! I found this place on Yelp and tried it for the first time today for lunch. Simple and delicious I will def come back. It's a nice place to just swing by and have relaxing lunch during the weekend by myself I had lentil soup, and three item dish including brown rice petty, black bean salad, and steamed vegi dish. All very nice."}
{"text":"Decent place! I wanted to try something healthy for a change amidst the numerous fast food Thai, Vietnamese, and Korean places that have opened up on Yonge street in the past few years. I opted for 2 items plus soup and chose a yummy golden rice ball and quinoa salad. My plate seemed like it needed more variety so I asked for an additional kale salad on the side. The food was tasty and flavourful. Overall the selection seemed small, but it could have been because I showed up in the late afternoon. Most of the dishes were like stews and I was hoping for more fresh and raw options. Staff was very friendly. Will have to check out this place again sometime!"}
{"text":"I appreciate what they're trying to do. I like that it's vegan and that it's organic. But... 

I've been there twice now and both times have been underwhelming. I'm okay with paying their high prices for food that tastes good, but theirs doesn't. I'm not sure if I didn't get the right things, but it was pretty tasteless.

The last time I was there I had their soup of the day which was oat/vegetable - interesting combo I thought... It tasted like eating wallpaper paste - absolutely no flavour and very few _tiny_ veggies. The lentils I got were the same, it didn't seem to have any spices or flavours at all. The patty I got (I'm not sure what it was made out of) was pretty delicious, but it was tiny and counted as one item in my three item combo. I think I paid something like $14 without a drink. Pricey for a flavourless meal.

Overall, I couldn't finish the soup and I left most of the lentils. I just ate a bigger dinner than normal."}
{"text":"Good, healthy food but as others have said definitely a bit pricey.  
The red rice balls, green patties, dahl, quinoa salad and green stew are my favourites.  
Only downfall other than price is that I do find it can be a bit on the salty side sometimes but it varies from day to day."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have the best vegetarian organic food near Yonge and Bloor. Food is pricey  (3 items cost $15) for the amount they serve but its worth it.

Service is fast and quick and the menu changes daily but remains consistent week over week, i.e., they have a certain number of dishes they rotate through over the week...all of which are yummy.

Highly recommend everyone to check it out for a lunch or dinner. Its a casual sit down resturaunt...no reservations are needed."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here. Everything is organic, vegetarian, dairy free, sugar and gluten free and its all delicious. Each bite I am transported into a world of fresh flavors! The rice balls are so good, the kale salad and quinoa salad with some tahini is a must! Love the raw cheesecake too!"}
{"text":"High-quality, organic and GMO-free food...just like home cooking!! Delish!!"}
{"text":"As advertised - healthy food, good selection, good atmosphere, attentive and helpful staff. One of my new favorites when downtown."}
{"text":"I chose to visit Camros based on the yelp reviews, and I was not disappointed. The food was tasty, and well priced. The atmosphere was cute, and they had a bulletin board with little love notes pinned up from their loyal customers. While I was there, many Camros fans dropped by, probably on their way home from work, to grab dinner to go. 

I loved my food, and felt great after eating a healthy, organic meal!

One note is that some of the staff was extremely welcoming and friendly, while there was one girl dishing up food that may have been having a very bad day. When I asked what the soup was, she didn't speak but just pointed to a board that was totally out of view and acted like I was dumb for not seeing it. We all have our bad days, so whatever, but thought it was weird based on how overly nice everyone else was!"}
{"text":"Their food is quite delicious. If you're looking for vegan food, this is the best place for it in Toronto, in my opinion. The food is Persian (or Persian-inspired) and everything is full of flavour. I find the prices to be a bit high, even for organic, especially for items that are not the main food items. Coffee is like $3 for regular French press coffee, and the big cookies are $3+ (but delicious). They have filtered water, which is a definite plus. It's a nice place to go to, especially in the winter. It smells nice and the food is like healthy comfort food. They have a loyalty card program."}
{"text":"the kale salad was good, everything else was bland or poorly done. the butternut squash soup was too salty, and the chickpeas were just *boring* beyond belief. 

having prepared very tasty fresh ingredients in a bland and boring manner, i know about screw ups. and given all the positive reviews here, i hope this was just a bad day in the kitchen.

i will say that i got some disappointing news while having lunch, and that may ever so slightly color my review. but even discovering the winning lottery ticket in my pocket while tasting these chickpeas would not have redeemed them, in any way."}
{"text":"Really sweet staff and very helpful. Not many options when I came in but could have been the time of day. What I had was amazing!!! Kale salad and a chickpea stew yum!"}
{"text":"With positve reviews that I'd bookmarked from Yelp in mind,  on a hungry mission afterwork one day I decided to try well revered Camros Organic Eatery.  

Tucked away from the freakshow sketchiness of the Yonge street strip, on Hayden street beside a Green P lot,  Camros is a deliciously cozy oasis of  heartwarming Persian organic delights.  

The set up is cafeteria-like with open seating and a hot food bar with the days special menu items on display.  Exotic flavours abound as items with names I can't pronounce exude wonderful aromas that tempt me to want to order EVERYTHING. Thank goodness there is a friendly ambiguously Asian ( I think?) none-the-less very personable fellow that was very helpful and informative , in fact everyone here is so nice with a capital N!

 I end up choosing something called the \"silly squash\" stew with a lentil patty with saffron brown rice for $10.79 which is pricey yes but all the hard work and effort Camros put into serving up 100% GENUINELY organic ( I mean heck they're even bold enough to list all their suppliers to prove organic integrity!) come with a price.  Not to mention all their take-out containers and utensils are made by Greenshift so it's 100% biodegradeable. 

 Camros switches up it's menu offerings from week to week to keep your tastebuds jonesing for more.  I've also tried the Gheyme Lentil stew which is savory with a  twinge of sweetness from the plums as well as the brown rice Cabbage roll yum!  

Camros also offers up a small yet fresh and delicious selection of raw/vegan/ gluten free desserts. The raw mint chocolate \"cookie\" is ball of finely pulverized almonds with mint tinged fudgy chocolate and is absolutely the BOMB!  I am literally willing to give up eating macarons for this guilt free treat as well as the Lime coconut cake which is heavenly to the point that I start hearing harps plucking in the background when I eat it.

 According to their website \"Camros is a spirited bird from ancient Persian mythology. It gathers seeds of life and brings them to people for nourishment and enjoyment\"  Maybe all this feel-goodery is psychosomatic but I can't help but feel so awesome everytime I eat here.   Have I found the fountain of youth, or have I died and gone to organic vegan/gluten free heaven? Nah I'm just basking in the afterglow of Camros' awesomeness."}
{"text":"After working in the area for more than a year, I finally decided to try Camros. 

Full disclosure: I'm not a vegetarian, a vegan, or an environmentalist. I find Denis Leary hilarious, and think that Charlie Sheen is a misunderstood genius. My social conscience is stunted, and I rooted for McDonalds in \"Super Size Me\". I double-bag my groceries, and when the coffee-shop cashier gives me the baby-seal eyes when I ask for a second cup for my scalding cup of fair-trade-shade-grown-ecologically-sustainable-fairy-dusted joe, I ask for a third. 

That said, Camros is awesome. 

I'm currently in the middle of a week-long experiment in lunchtime veganism, after too many afternoons spent lolling at my desk like Jabba the Hut being choked to death. 


Day 1: Random Vegetable soup, with big chunks of carrot, lentils, brown rice that's split from sitting in the broth, and a fistful of cabbage in a pleasing tomato broth. It comes with millet bread, which has a pleasant chew. The soup is great; full of contrasting flavours and textures. I don't even like lentils, and this is good. The bread could use a bit of a toasting, but I'm so pleasantly surprised that I'm cool with it. I'm full until day's end and surprisingly alert and productive, even with a McDonald's free coffee as a chaser. Also, the girl working the counter is really, really cute in a crunchy-granola way. You'd be surprised how often that affects lunchtime decisions. 

Day 2: I'm really hungry, so I opt for a plate of brown Persian rice and daal. At about 9 bucks, it's a splurge, but sometimes you want something hot over rice. It doesn't disappoint. Can rice be a highlight? I still don't like lentils, but make an exception for the filling, subtly-spiced mash on my plate. As I get used to my new lunchtime home, I note that they have cayenne pepper (though no hot sauce). It adds welcome zip to the plate. Also, pink salt. I giggle with delight as I apply some to my dish. It's not really necessary, but I'm a sucker for anything pink, in a masculine, performative, heteronormative way. Washed down with a latte from nearby Crema Coffee (I'm still not up for soya milk), it's an expensive lunch, but satisfying, and I can actually stay vertical in my chair afterwards. I'm greeted by the same server. She's still pretty. 

Day 3: More Persian rice, this time topped with creamy lima bean and zucchini stew. The stew starts off deliciously creamy, but gets stodgy as it cools. Zucchini is there, but texturally overwhelmed by the beans. It's a more aggressively salted dish. For the first time, I'm full with plenty of food left to go on my plate. They recognize me when I come in and ask what's good. The soup, a puree of cauliflower etc. looks really good. Hopefully they've got more for tomorrow. 

Day 4: I'm welcomed warmly by the staff, and for some reason feel the urge to start a commune. They smile a lot here. They're soft-spoken. All of my fellow diners are in really good shape. I get back to the office and check out yoga classes on Yelp. Maybe I'll burn my suits, turn in my laminated ID card and raise goats...oh yeah: lunch. It's a puree of cauliflower on other veg, warmly spiced and slightly chunky. And a rice ball. A delicious, golden rice ball that smells of turmeric and comes stuffed with raisins and walnuts. I want for nothing until dinner, except a good cup of coffee. I am at peace until I return to work, and a meeting where it turns out I was right all along. Namaste, suckers. 

Say 5: We return to the Lima bean and zucchini stew, this time unadorned except for a bite or two of the kelp and beet salads (which provide much-needed textural contrast and an acid hit). I see the error of my ways earlier this week, when I went a bit overboard with the pink salt and cayenne. Left on it's own, the dish provides wonderful, subtle flavors. The rice is different; a Persian pilaf that erupts with nuts and dried fruits. Heading into lunch, I entertained the thought of returning to my carnivorous ways. I'm glad that I stayed the course, as I return to the office in a great frame of mind of a Friday afternoon. Besides, I'm having Vietnamese for dinner with friends. With crack-worthy coffee and Vietnamese donuts for dessert (a rare treat that I allow myself, for being good all week long). 

I think I'll keep the experiment going next week, at least until the reality of paying $10 a day for glorified beans and rice kicks in. Maybe the price is right for a tasty hot meal that keeps me at my quasi-functional best as daylight bleeds to 5 PM. I can certainly make do with the occasional bit of preachiness, if only because of the cute blonde who may slowly be turning me into a better person, one lunch at a time."}
{"text":"Popped in here on a chilly evening, lured in by the warm promise of organic eats fogging up their shop windows. Or maybe it was just condensation. At any rate, Camros Organic Eatery is a solid stop for 'healthy' eats that fills you up without leaving you feeling like a disaster.

It's a tiny spot, so I wouldn't bring a crowd. Seems like a great place for lunch or a date with that granola chicklet you picked up in Trinity Bellwoods. There is a sole booth, and an array of 2-tops and a street-facing counter with stools.

You order before sitting, and select from a variety of veggie stews, slaws and salads. I opted for a millet salad, dill coleslaw and the rice ball of legend. It was off the hook. The millet salad was loaded with delicious chickpeas, and mingled nicely with the tahini sauce drizzled on top. The slaw was solid and quite dilly (if you're into that, which I am). I was initially disappointed that I only got one rice ball, but that little guy packs a punch. It's rolled up basmati rice and herbs with a sweet centre. We weren't sure what it was, but it tasted like plum or fig. Truly delicious. At $11 for a three item meal, it's a steal.

I can't wait to come back and try their other options. Apparently they rotate their menu frequently.

Obligatory Title Pun: CAM one, CAM all!

Menu Readability: There was a chalkboard with an Asimov quote in giant letters. 'Nuff said.

Need to mention: They also make fresh juice here.

What this place teaches me about myself: I could easily give up meat if I lived next door to this place."}
{"text":"I was starving and looking for a decent place to eat other than some fast food chain joint. With the help of yelp I went to this place. The black bean salad was so good full of flavor, I could have just had that and been happy but I got the lentil stew & saffron brown rice along with it that was a lovely addition to the meal."}
{"text":"\"Feel good during and after eating\" - that's Camros Organic Eatery's motto. Think about that for a second. 

Right? So many times we gorge ourselves on food only to feel uncomfortably bloated and unwell afterwards. If not immediately, then within a few hours. I'm happy to report that this was not the case at Camros, and the accolades from Yelp, NOW, Eye Weekly and scores of handwritten customer reviews backed up their claims. Even the name \"Camros\" is purposeful. It's a spirited bird from ancient Persian mythology that gathers seeds of life and brings them to people for nourishment and enjoyment. How quaint.

Everything at Camros is organic, vegetarian, gluten free, sugar and dairy free (WAIT! DON'T STOP READING!). They soak their grains and legumes prior to increase digestability and pair interesting flavours together to create the most interesting combinations. 

I ordered the Autumn Soup with a half serving of the lima bean stew and quinoa salad with tzatziki. The soup was hands down my favourite and had the most incredible flavours - I wish I was eating it right this minute. Noodles (brown rice, but who could tell?), carrots, chickpeas, green peas, potatoes, tomatoes, turmeric, cayenne and lots of fresh dill.

Another great thing about Camros is that all the ingredients for specials are listed next to the names so those with allergies, sensitivities or on detoxes can choose accordingly.

I was left stuffed - but not uncomfortably so - for $9 including tax.

One final note - Camros is closed on weekends and is more of a lunch counter/walkup spot. Don't come here on a date or with a group of 20 people."}
{"text":"I'm absolutely loving Camros... 

For everyone whose about healthy living or just want a healthier choice for lunch it's the place to go. 

You know what exactly is going in your meal because the ingredients are listed which is nice...they even use organic foods when they have them. 

I'd suggest trying the rice ball! Also another bonus is that when you're on the go you can take your healthy meal to go!"}
