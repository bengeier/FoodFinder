{"text":"Typical all-you-can-eat Chinese buffet restaurant.  Great selection, especially at dinner.  Good at lunch as well.  
Delivery menu is also great.  Portions are huge.  Dinner for one easily feeds two.
Their egg rolls are the best.  Love the cherry sauce!!"}
{"text":"We are vegetarians. Even it's a buffet, the owner made some vegetarian spring rolls and veggie soups for us. Very appreciated."}
{"text":"J'aime ce buffet c'est le meilleur des meilleurs surtout les brochettes de crevettes superbe place"}
{"text":"Out of the All-You-Can-Eat buffets in LaSalle, the Mandarin is the best one.

They serve their food fresh for both the noon and evening buffets. After the noon buffet is finished, any leftovers get thrown out, unlike some buffets than just reheat them and serve them in the evening buffet (cough Fu Lam cough). The food tastes better, too (sorry Vichy).

You'll have a nice selection of Chinese and American-style cuisine, with staples like dumplings, egg rolls, General Tao chicken and of course pork, beef and lamb. You might like the desserts with tarts, jello and ice cream to choose from.

It's a bit pricey, especially in the evening and on weekends, so if you want to save, try to make it between noon and about 3:00PM for the noon buffet."}
{"text":"Out of Vichy, fulam or Mandarin you're better off at the Mandarin.

They're always polite and professional.
Of course the food isn't out of this world but what Buffett is right ?

If you go earlier for dinner then you'll have a better selection with fresher food of course.

You can pick up a take out container and fill it up and leave as well which I think is pretty cool if you live around there."}
{"text":"Ok selection of food.  Good customer service.  Desserts weren't great. A bit pricey.  Friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stopped in Buffet Chinois Mandarin for lunch as part of 3 days tour. We were treated to their weekday lunch buffet. Our tour guide told us there are no better Chinese restaurant in the city. If true - Montreal, I feel sorry for you.

The buffet spread, even from presentation alone, was enough drive us away. Every item was drenched in oil. Additionally, foods were almost never replenished. I walked around most of our time dining there with an empty plate. What I managed to pick onto my plate had either absolute no taste or carried a strange aftertaste. The only items I managed to stomach were their bread and a few veggie pieces from the soup (the soup itself was inedible). 

And it got worse - After our lunch, three members of the tour group suffered from severe stomach cramps and had to make an emergency rest stop. If buffet chinois mandarin is the best Chinese restaurant Montreal has to offer, I would recommend not to eat Chinese at all."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, and I must say this is probably the best Chinese buffet in Montreal.  Normally the food at buffets is stale and sometimes cold and lacking, but I can't get enough of this place! I always get the wonton soup (which is delish), and fill my first plate with equal heaping piles of fried rice and broccoli, and then add on an egg roll, some chicken on a stick and general tao. I absolutely adore the fried rice and broccoli; thinking about it now, I must admit is making me salivate. After downing the first plate, I pretty much made the same plate a second time around; except instead of the chicken and egg roll, I got more broccoli and shrimp (which you grill yourself). For dessert, a couple of fresh sugar doughnuts and a mix of cappuccino and chocolate ice cream. 

And so ensued the food/msg coma, which was well worth it. I always try to get my 20$ worth, regardless if it leaves me sluggish and full!"}
{"text":"A Lasalle il y a plusieurs restaurants asiatique mais côté buffet nous ne sommes pas choyé. Le Mandarin se distingue par la qualité de sa nourriture. Le poulet General Tao tendre et succulent, les eggrolls savoureux et le grille permettant de cuire brochette de poulet ou de crevettes et des steaks aux poivres. 

Bref si vous desirez manger dans un buffet chinois le mandarin est tout désigné"}
