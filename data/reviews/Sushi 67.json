{"text":"I only tried the rolls but most of the ones I tried were good. The spicy tuna and sunday rolls were great. I'm very picky about my rolls and this place makes the cut. I have tasted some of the pricier sushi places in toronto and they don't come near this one.  The decor is lovely and the service is friendly. They have nice touches like a water container with fresh fruit within it.  The are a bit pricey but given the size I think they can get away with it..I think.."}
{"text":"Fantastic Fresh Fish! I felt so fortunate to have discovered this place... a total gem, with fresh ingredients and creative maki options. I was horrified when I saw a little sign go up in the window that they would be closing Feb24th. So long sushi67... you will be terribly missed. I could have eaten here everyday and been very happy."}
{"text":"We just had dinner there tonight. It was well worth the long walk down Roncy (passing two other sushi places on the way). Everyone in the kitchen is enthusiastic on people's arrival and departure. Two of us shared the 10 pc individual combo with a spicy hamachi roll, smoked salmon salad, and the stuffed cucumber makimono. The 10-pc is chef's choice (and this time came with 4 salmon, 1 shrimp, 1 tamago, and 4 other sushi) and was just ok. The spicy hamachi was good. But it was the salad and cucumber roll that were the stars of the meal. The salad had a delicious bed of rocket/arugula and then every topping was bursting with flavor (capers, jalapenos, olives, cream cheese, etc) but cut thin to not be overwhelming. The stuffed cucumber roll was unique and also amazingly delicious. Very fresh tasting.  As others mentioned, the tea is not a typical asian restaurant tea, but a slightly sweet aromatic flowery tea. We're looking forward to going back and having the same dishes and trying some of the others.  other notes - the waitress was very patient with us reading over the menu for a long time trying to decide and let us put in our order in parts, and also delivered the bill with a small complimentary dessert. Lots of people came in for to go orders."}
{"text":"Arguably the best sushi on Roncesvalles, the place is very small (especially the seats themselves) and plays some very strange \"jazzified\" cover music of popular tunes from the past few decades.  Sushi 67 has very friendly service, fresh sushi and fun little free desserts. I recommend everything on the relatively small menu except the White Vietnam Roll. It's downright weird!  There's some great Engrish on the menu to entertain you while you wait!"}
{"text":"After seeing the strong reviews, I was anxious to try out a spot not far from home. Glad  I did. First, as observed by others, the people here are really, really nice. If you can buy something from nice people, all the better!  The menu looked really short and at first I was quite disappointed. It looked like every roll was based on creamy crab. Then I asked if this or that was available and they pointed it out in the more low-key and shorthand areas of the menu. I get the sense that they would make anything for you as long as they had the ingredients.  I had: Albacore sashimi, spicy tuna roll, Roncesvalles roll, unagi fire roll, mixed sashimi and one other crabby roll. Sashimi is the measure of a sushi restaurant and texture is crucial. All to often the texture is right-from-the-freezer mushy, even ice-crystally sometimes. Not here. If they froze this fish (as many do to kill parasites), I could not tell. All of the sashimi tasted great in flavour and texture.  The rolls were seasoned just right. The Roncy roll was really tasty. Unagi fire was a win, as was the spicy tuna.  Not a single thing was wrong with this meal. Oh, they didn't pack much wasabi in. There you go."}
{"text":"the best 10 piece Nigiri and 6 piece maki combo in the city.  We've been going to 67 for almost a year now and have gotten to know the chef and staff there. they are committed to the community and are in a perfect location for a caffeine fix ( cherry bomb ) a foriegn flick rental ( film buff) and a hair cut ( kayes)  its a limited selection menu as they only want to carry the most fresh fish around, sometime they bring in some really good fish so its always good to ask what is the freshest and when its coming in..  there is a bit of french/korean/mexican fusion in the mix, and i'm now addicted to their udon salad.  well worth the streetcar ride.!  take out and pick up can be a bit of a wait but its worth it."}
{"text":"FIRST AND FOREMOST THIS IS NOT A RESTAURANT... ITS A TAKE OUT JOINT WITH QUICK LUNCH STYLE SEATING (no bathroom)....but i will not dismiss that they wait on you as if its a lovely restaurant.  so i digress I quickly skimmed over some reviews on yelp ( my fault for not reading in detail) so i thought it would have a loo aka a bathroom ..... and of course if did not... so i found my self walking up the street to a lovely lil ronces bakery to go to the lil ladies room.  When i came back my father and friend greeted me with a vanilla infused green tea ... normally im not a fan of our lovely over played vanilla ( candles cologne etc...) but i like it.  All of our dishes that followed were perfect.  it felt as if you were allowed to sit and eat at sushi marche in leslieville.    sushi 67 to me seems like a place that is a better option for take out, unless your grabbing a quick bite.  im not going to get into the detail of the sushi it because it was all well crafted , if i lived closer or worked in the hood they would see me a lot more of me.  must try for ronces dwellers."}
{"text":"If there is anything you should be picky about when it comes to food - it should be sushi. Sushi 67 delivers fresh fish at a reasonable price. Its very tiny and they know us by now - I'll have to ask about the free dessert?!  Located in a great neigbourhood. Lots of friendly people, dogs, cute shops and ice cream at film buff next door. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is awesome.  I don't mind when a restaurant moves away from authenticity if they do it in such a creative (and delicious) way, as Sushi 67 does.  First things first - it's a tiny place.  Probably no more than 10 people could fit in the whole restaurant comfortably.  We were a group of 4, and luckily no one else was eating in, although we saw many come and go for take out orders.  Despite it's size and the fact that not a lot of their customers seem to eat in, they have spent some time on the décor.  It's not tacky nor is it plain as you might expect; it's nicely done.  The service is also incredibly friendly, and very gracious when receiving our many compliments.  We started off by ordering the Manhattan Bridge Roll (my favourite of the evening, absolutely delish), the White Vietnam Roll (very good also, very fresh tasting), and more typical spicy salmon rolls and red tuna sushi.  We downed these pretty quickly and found ourselves wanting more, so we ordered the Dynamite Rolls and the Scallop Pot Pie.  We were told that the pot pie would take a while to cook, but we were fine to wait.  This is where service was great - they gave us free miso soup to apologize for the wait, even though we had said we were fine with it!  Great!  Sure, miso is often included at sushi restaurants, but it isn't here, so I appreciated the gesture.    The dynamite rolls were not typical, despite being a typical type of sushi.  They had asparagus, and tartar sauce, and just looked completely different.  They were delicious.  But the most creative thing we saw was definitely the scallop pot pie.  Wow.  The menu, we were all pretty sure, said 8 pieces, but don't be fooled - this comes as one serving.  We were all feeling friendly, so we didn't mind.  It really is a pot pie with shrimp pieces, scallops, crab, and avocado as well as rice, bread and cheese.  It was very tasty, and I really enjoyed it - although I wasn't a fan of the bread.  It was your cheapy white bread that I feel isn't really bread at all.  But I definitely loved the dish overall, and the entire meal we had.    All in all, this is probably my favourite sushi place I've been to, and I've tried a few.  Interesting variations and combinations make it so much more fun for an adventurous eater like me, and really good prices make it a fantastic value.  Will return, even after I move to the other side of the city in a month - it's that good!  Should mention - it's a tiny restaurant, so no surprise - they're not licensed."}
{"text":"This place closed for a while and has now re-opened for TAKE-OUT ONLY.  I really liked the cosy little restaurant and the yummy tea and fruit-infused water that was served with the meal. I'm going to miss eating there! I think I'll have to get takeout from here now that they're open again but I used to always eat in.   I'm not sure if the menu has changed much but everything I've ever tried is really great... fresh, beautiful sushi served up by some truly chipper and masterful sushi chefs (I love how all the kitchen staff would make a point of calling out 'hello' and 'goodbye/thank you' from the open kitchen. So warm and friendly).   I usually order rolls with salmon and tuna that melt in my mouth. I like ordering the more creative rolls because the layered flavours are usually really interesting, comforting (mayo and crumbled tempura batter!), and delicious to the point of being gorgeous. The chefs throw all kinds of interesting and unassuming ingredients that shine in the rolls and there are often some pretty tasty reductions/sauces on top. All of their rolls somehow balance being pretty and artful while packing sumptuous flavour and gratifying portions. Yea! I usually just order a few rolls, my friends and companions have ordered the starters and I've tried them.. and it seems like the starters are kindof like little snacks centered on satisfying cravings for a particular flavour/food and don't really 'wow' me. Particularly the grilled/steamed tofu or coconut tempura shrimp, I've found both to be very tasty in their simplicity but unremarkable.  I like how creative/cheeky the menu can get with some Japanese/Canadian fusion offered. I ordered some pickled veggie rolls one time and some of them came with dill pickles paired with avocado. It was surprisingly delicious. Also the baked beet salad.. with mango, pine nut, goats cheese, and balsamic- surprising, refreshing, and lovely with sushi to follow. The menu seems to change with new ideas and availability of ingredients and there are always specials based around fresh seafood, which is the mark of a truly great sushi place/any great seafood restaurant. Overall, everything is extremely reasonably priced for the quality.   Try this place, you will love it."}
{"text":"I just ordered take out... glad I did!  I normally would order from Vincent but I haven't been that impressed with them lately so I figured I'd go back to Sushi 67.  I've eaten in there before and it was great - will miss the few seats that they had.   I ordered the Unagi Fire Maki roll (9 pieces, $11.99) and one each of the spicy salmon and spicy tuna maki (6 pieces, $3.49).  The Unagi Fire Maki is delicious... great texture, love the creamy crab inside, with the cucumber and shrimp tempura. I would absolutely order this roll again. It's a little more than I'd like to pay but I appreciate the effort and presentation (even for takeout) that went into it, and it was really fresh.  The spicy tuna has this awesome sweet/spicy red chili sauce on top - not spicy mayo like I expected.  The salmon had the mayo.. great heat, not too much.. Leaves a nice warmth in your mouth after your done eating.    Total order: $21. I ate it all.. loved it all, and will definitely be ordering again."}
{"text":"First time ordering from 67, got delivery.  Ordered spicy tuna maki rolls, beet salad and scallop pie.  The maki and the beet salad was pretty good.  I was quite disappointed with the scallop pie dish, if was trailer park and way over priced at over $12.  Hard to find good sushi delivery so I am willing to give this place another try but stick to more traditional dishes."}
{"text":"\"Helloooo!!!\"  ...is what three happy Japanese chefs will chirp every time someone walks into their cozy little home-style sushi kitchen.  The restaurant features home appliances, bamboo walls and only a few tables.  If you decide to stay in... you will get the typical free jasmine green tea (only theirs is deliciously flavoured with added fruits... usually oranges).  You will also get a free dessert and outstanding table service... and a show if you like to watch the chefs... sometimes they sing!  Take away... you get 10% off!  Either way, its incredible gourmet sushi.    One my favourites is the unique sushi scallop pot pie...  I think I've tried the entire menu now... every dish is unique and among the best tasting sushi to ever pass by my lips!   \"Goodbye!!!  Thank You!  See you again!\""}
{"text":"As frequent visitors to Sushi 67, we've been relatively disappointed in our last couple of visits. After having a couple of our vegetarian friends over for a night of board games, we decided to order from Sushi 67 which always had a veggie roll, or two on their menus. Apparently, it's seasonal (a bit odd) and not available after the beginning of May. The rolls we had were decent per usual, but the veggie rolls we did eventually bargain for were prohibitively expensive compared to what it should have been. To that, we won't go to Sushi 67 anymore if veggie is what we need."}
{"text":"UPDATE:  It's gone and I am DEVASTATED.  Out of sheer principle I will not frequent the sushi business that has taken this spot.  I will MOURN Sushi 67 for the rest of my days.  Someone please tell me where those wonderful people have gone and I will follow."}
{"text":"How cute!  I found this place when doing a yelp search of sushi places that I would drive by after a long day of work. I called ahead and ordered takeout so I can't speak for the in-restaurant experience, but the place itself is pretty adorable. There are only a few tables and decor is fresh and cute, and the kitchen staff greets everyone as they come in the door too so you feel very welcome.  I had the spicy hamachi roll, some salmon sushi, and avocado rolls. I fully expected to get home and realize that they had missed something on my order because the price seemed too good to be true, but everything was there!   Try this sushi spot over the others on Roncy!"}
{"text":"Sushi 67 is one of those rare uninhibited Japanese restaurants that boldly experiments with unconventional flavour combinations and succeeds. We're not talking anything crazy here. The chefs just know how to add a little excitement into your regular maki routine to keep things interesting.  With a quick glance at their concise menu card, it becomes evident that this isn't your average sushi restaurant. So far, my favourite maki is in fact not really sushi at all. The White Vietnamese Roll is without rice and features spicy mayo, mango, fish, and tobiko wrapped in rice paper. It's not filling, but very refreshing!  As the teeny tiny dining room/reception area features miniature furniture and no customer washrooms, the discount for calling ahead and picking up your order seems like just a bonus reason as to why you might want to go the take out route."}
{"text":"I just love small, cute Japanese restaurant!! Sushi! 67 really fits the bill.. So small that it is like a takeout place with just 10 seats only if you do want to eat in!   I walked by the restaurant on a cold, freezing winter afternoon and could not resist not to go in. I was greeted by 5 really energetic young Japanese staffs. in unison....   Since Sush! 67 is a \"Fresh Japanese Noodle and Rolls\", I decided to try their Ramen ($6.95) as the menu described as \"Japanese spicy soup touched as house secret spice with green onion, mushroom and onion\". Spicy sounded good? and Ramen on a cold day?   There are 4 kitchen staffs working in the open kitchen 5 feet away from me, they were all busy doing preparation and the nice waitress so smiley and nice too.   hmmm Ramen arrived with a garlic bread..?? I guess this is a fusion place! The ramen itself was a little disappointed.. I DON'T eat instant noodle, the noodle definitely are from packaged noodle.. lucky they did not use the little packaged soup inside to make the broth.. The broth is really good though with a really nice and delicate flavour with just a little hint of spiciness..   The nice waitress remind me next time to call and will get 15% off for takeout order.   I wondering how the fusion sushi and Japanese appetizers will taste like??"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying out Sushi 67; I had heard really good things.  Thinking back, these people all ate fish.  My review is based solely on vegetarian options.  Staff was super friendly.  The Hungry Vegetarian roll had everything AND the kitchen sink in it.  We're talking jalapeño peppers (!) There wasn't a distinct flavor combination - it just all mushed together.  Their vegetarian sushi set was okay - more straight forward except for ones with thinly sliced mango (our best guess).  The prices weren't equatable for vegetables, in my opinion."}
{"text":"I came across \"Sushi 67\" last week when I was returning a movie to the Film Buff (Sushi 67 is 2-3 doors south). It was brightly coloured and the take out menu that advertised delivery was nicely designed.  I tried \"Sushi 67\" today for the first time, and I have to strongly urge people in the area to try this place out!! The service and staff were amazing - their jubilant \"hello!\" when you enter is absolutely infectious. There are about 8 seats in the cozy sushi resto for the Japanese owners to serve, and they also work in the kitchen.  - The complimentary hot tea is fragrant with sweet orange flowers and delicious. It wasn't diluted, and was very aromatic.   - I got the ramen noodles with quail eggs - noodles were cooked very nicely with a bite, and the quail eggs were cooked perfectly. Toppings were some thinly sliced mushrooms, tofu, onions, and black sesame seeds. The dish was served with a fresh toasted piece of garlic baguette that you could dip into the spiced left over soup. It was a great touch to the simple dish. The chopsticks were wrapped with the napkin and tied with a gold ribbon. Very detail oriented! - The staff was so friendly, and very welcoming. The owner (Jason) offered me a free sample of one of their deluxe specialty rolls with wasabi creme. It was excellent, and I'm def going to get it next time!  - The service throughout the meal was 10/10, they were very attentive as they checked on me, my food, and refilled my delicious tea a few times. At the end of the meal I was offered a cute bowl with some fresh fruit topped with honey and delicate honey crisps. Very delicious and a perfect way to end the meal.  - I can't think of anything bad about the experience, even the music was soothing and mood lifting (soft jazz, classical instrumentals, etc). The bill came in a bright green basket with a bookmark that said \"sushi 67\" - so cute! . I think this resto is a great addition to the area, they do take out as well as delivery according to the menu. They are a new small resto start-up offering a great dining experience in the area. I left with a grin on my face! I will definitely be back here to try the other excellent dishes and enjoy the friendly service!!"}
{"text":"When we walked in we were pleasantly greeted by all the wait staff and chefs saying hello to us in cheery unison - we half expected them to burst into song. It was our first visit and the waitress was very helpful in answering our questions about the menu.  We ordered the Roncesvalle Signature Makimono Roll, the Spicy Tuna Roll and the Spicy Hamachi Roll... We loved the Tuna and the Roncesvalle; the Hamachi was also quite good although it was a tiny bit sweet for my tastes, and not really spicy at all. We also got an order of the Coconut Tempura Shrimp which isn't on their regular menu, but was written on their daily specials board... THESE were far more disappointing. They were okay for taste, but the shrimp were VERY small and they were not in tempura batter at all, but just regular Thai Coconut Shrimp. They also did not taste that fresh, and were rather overpriced at $8 for 6 tiny shrimps.  All in all, the Makimono rolls were fairly well priced and yummy but I wouldn't order the \"tempura\" shrimp again. We ordered take-out and will come back again but now we know that if we call ahead we get an extra 15% off.  As we left, they all said goodbye and thanked us... again in sync."}
