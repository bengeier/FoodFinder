{"text":"First time coming here with my boyfriend and boy was it delicious!!  Definitely recommend you to get the green chilaquiles with the eggs & meat!"}
{"text":"Friendly service. Good solid, simple food at reasonable prices. Breakfast all day! We got the huevos con chorizo and a combo plate with a taco, enchilada, and sope. Good portions and the food came quickly."}
{"text":"Curiously walked into this empty place on a Friday afternoon.. that should have been my cue to walk out. Carne asada nachos were a huge disappointment. Small portion, salty chips, and the carne asada tastes like corned beef from a can. The cashier was on her phone in the back when I needed assistance and the restrooms had no paper towels or soap. Two stars for the cleanliness, though. But per the rule of thumb, this place was too clean to be good."}
{"text":"I grab lunch here quite often.  The lady who is at the register is so nice and will bring my food over to where I work if they're not quite busy.  This is good food at a good price.  The Nachos are my favorite plate, or nachos but sub fries for a good version of carne asada fries."}
{"text":"This was a great find for Mexican food at it's best.
We keep returning because it is so so good. Wonderful broth with the shrimp soup which are butterflied jumbo size. And chili rellanos fantastic.
Highly recommend this little place near Target."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Mexican food! The lady working the front was super friendly and provided the best service I've had in a while! Posole on a Monday is unheard of in California and I was thankful it was a regular menu item after a long night. The sopes were crispy and the pastor was well seasoned. I would come back."}
{"text":"Didn't try the chips & salsa since paying for them when ordering a meal at a Mexican restaurant doesn't seem right. Sopes were pretty bland - could have used more salsa but that costs extra too. So price vs quality  means I won't be back"}
{"text":"Tried this hole in the wall place out. This place is the bomb. Service is good. Food is made to order and very tasty. The prices are on point... My new favorite place..."}
{"text":"This place has amazing tostadas. I had the shrimp and ceviche ones, they are kind of spicy but that's the best part! The micheladas are authentic!"}
{"text":"This is the cutest Mexican restaurant!  I always pass by,  but I finally decided to try it today ! I had the camarones a la diabla, amazing , so good!  I'm definitely coming back.....  I have  to try the whole menu!"}
{"text":"A family owned and run restaurant with Excellent food and service. This place is very well decorated and always playing good Hispanic music. We come all the way from Orange County California just to eat some delicious Pozole, which they serve every single day, something we don't get in socal. Worth every Penny! Try the birria and the enchiladas too!"}
{"text":"We stopped here to waste about an hour and grab a bite to eat! It was some of the best Mexican food my in laws and I have ever had! I would highly recommend this hole-in-the-wall place :)"}
{"text":"Amazing, AUTHENTIC Mexican food! Lots of places claim to be authentic but really aren't, but this is the real deal! Came here while on a weekend getaway and had to go both days! That's how yummy it is. Enchiladas are the best I've tried & the cabeza tacos are delicious! Boyfriend is usually picky with seafood but he had the ceviche tostada and said it was delicious. We had the same server both days and she was the sweetest, wish I had asked for her name but was distracted by the food. This was definitely a hit with everyone in our group."}
{"text":"GROSS!!! Chicken is dry, marinated pork yea not so marinated, and the carne asada is just nasty. I trusted the good reviews on yelp but the food was not as good as the reviews this place was given. The only way I'm gonna try a new food place is if a friend recommends it."}
{"text":"COME HUNGRY! This place is amazing. I need like 5 more tacos to take home. Pretty sure they make their tortillas in house. Salsa will kick your butt it's so yummy and spicy. I'm impressed. This place makes me want to eat more even though I'm stuffed. I will be back."}
{"text":"My mom and I were hungry and wanted breakfast. We were gonna go to IHOP but then we saw this place while we were walking and decided to give it a chance. We were glad we did. I got a champurrado and I'm so glad I did. It tasted so good that we wanted to take some home. My mom got the green chicken enchiladas and she says their were good as well as the beans that they tasted good. I got chorizo con huevo and it was great as well. I loved that their tortillas are home made. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Authentic Mexican Restaurant. Handmade corn tortillas for the tacos!! So Good! We will be coming back!! I had tacos de lengua and a tostada de ceviche de Camaron. Jamaica drink was excellent too!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were told to check out this chicken place in Vegas. We were down for the day and guess what, holiday weekend, the chicken place was closed. We pulled out our trusty Yelp and decided to give Tacos el Ray a try. 

I was super impressed with this restaurant. The food was great, portions above average. Price was very reasonable. We both ate for about the same cost as 2 Wendy's combo meals, plus we got the chips and salsa!

Chips and salsa... amazing, try em! The sodas were the right mixture of carbonation to syrup, just like they do in Mexico. The food was fantastic, nothing I can say negative about the food. 

The only reason why I cant give this place a 5star rating is upon leaving I got the worst gut ache of my life. I eat Mexican food 5-6 times a week. Something about this place messed me up. I loved the food, Id eat there again, but if the gut pain happened again, I would with great tears of sadness, have to give Tacos el Ray up... But the food... AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place once a week for about a year now. Family owned and ran. The food is always fresh and always SO delicious. They have specials that rotate out every week or two. I've tried a few and they're great as well. Some of the best micheladas in town. You owe it to yourself to go!"}
{"text":"I just got to say its the BEST mexican food in vegas!! Tacos el gordo sucks!! Im mexican and from LA so I know about mexican food this place is bomb!!! You guys have to come!!! We order enchiladas, sopes, tacos de barbacoa, fish taco, burrito de lengua! Everything was great and awesome customer service yes its small but comfortable!!"}
{"text":"Good authentic Mexican food. However, I did not like the fact that they did not offer complimentary chips and salsa like most other restaurants do. Plus the rice and beans served with the lunch combo was in a very small bowl unlike other places. But perhaps that's to be less filling haha."}
{"text":"Hubby & I found this place on Yelp after I went on because I was craving Mexican food. We saw all the good Yelp reviews so we decided to give it a chance, boy were we very very dissapointed with the quality of food.

I ordered the combination 7) that came with 2 enchiladas & 1 taco.
The taco was soft flavorless & very bland. The 2 enchiladas were dry inside & out they were more like dried chicken inside tortillas dried flavorless sauce & cheese. 
My husband ordered an el pastor torts & the meat tasted awful we questioned the waitress if it was El pastor.
Disappointing as well because most places offer complimentary chips & salsa but not this place they tried to charge us $3.99
Very dissapointed will not go back ever"}
{"text":"Dont judge a book by its cover.. Birria is delishh here ..refried beans delishhh  & homemade corn tortillas to die for =P... Service is a lil slow, but stars well deserved !! 

Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this place. Reminds me of the old school hangouts I have frequented with friends in authentic Mexican neighborhoods.

Fantastic chips and guacamole. Salsa is honestly the best I've ever had. And the tacos are fantastic (I sampled carne asada and shrimp)."}
{"text":"Very home made taste, real Mexican food. Just love the place and taste. 
 very good costumer service.  \" Chilaquiles are real salsa made not can."}
{"text":"good tacos.. the tortillas are some of the best I've ever had.

Chips and salsa were ok, salsa was a little salty but I've had worse.. the service was ok.. very friendly but for my first time there i would have liked a little more communication.. 

they have a lot of competition... i have so many favorite taco spots.. the carnitas were a little dry.. but ill be back to see what else they have to offer.. everything tasted very authentic"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Mexican food and this is coming from a couple of foodie chefs who are very particular about Mexican food.  

Salsas were perfect. The right consistency, flavor profile, not too spicy but just enough.  Chips and tortillas were some of the best we've ever had and we lived decades in Southern Cal and Arizona where there is much good food. 

Great variety on the menu and each dish is made with a focus on quality of flavor, texture and ingredients.  

Anytime we are in the are we will come here for sure."}
{"text":"I love there food , but went today and it was closed. People were waiting outside, and the phone was forward to a mobile voicemail."}
{"text":"This place is doing some real deal Mexican cooking!!!  I came for breakfast and had their take on the chilaquiles, which were out of this world-take it from me, I'm Mexican and they were about as authentic as you could get.  The staff were real friendly and said they make everything fresh.  En mis proximas vacaciones, yo regresare a comer a este restaurante porque la comida es muy rica!"}
{"text":"I pass by often and finally stopped in. Stopped by on a Monday afternoon. Wasn't really busy. 

Food was good. Place looks clean. Prices are reasonable. Authentic flavorful food. I was happy with the combination I ordered. 

Server was trying to convince my mom to try menudo. She didn't like it, but she can be pretty picky."}
