{"text":"It was a cold and windy day so me and my mother decided to get in the next restaurant to escape the cold. We ended up in the Café Cherrier. Outside and inside it looks really nice. It actually looks like a typical french bistro.

Our intention was to simply take a warm beverage in order to warm up and after leave to meet my father for lunch. When we explained we wanted only a tee, the waitress was really annoyed. She told us \"you know for drinks you need to go at the bar but unfortunately all spots are reserved\" and she added \"it's almost lunch time and a lot of people are coming here\" so in big she was trying to get rid of us since we were planning to order just drinks. I replied to the \"lady\" that we had mentioned it when entering and her colleague still let us in. Then the \"lady\" said alright. So at the end she served us what we asked. After our tee, we left and the restaurant was still half empty and the bar \"reserved for drink\" as well. So yes this 1 star is only due to the bad service we had not for the drinks nor for the restaurant it self."}
{"text":"The flat steak and frites was terrific! The ambiance on the terrace was perfect. If we were here another day I would be tempted to go back."}
{"text":"Bon accueil, place rapidement, tres sympas avec les enfants, servis tres vite , tres bon brunch classique. Belle terrasse"}
{"text":"Bistro français doté des meilleurs ufs bénédictines de la ville..."}
{"text":"Always love this place. The food and service go from good to decent. Its really about the history and feel - is the closest thing to a parisian cafe. Get a carafe of wine and a warm goat cheese salad and you are truly in the spirit of France. Always sit outside weather permitting!"}
{"text":"We ended up at cafe Cherrier for a late lunch (2 PM) on a Tuesday afternoon and to our surprise the place was packed. We took it as a sure sign of good food and value.
At first glance cafe Cherrier looks like a typical French bistro like the ones you would find in any French centre ville. Indeed this is exactly what the place delivers but with an emphasis on higher tier dishes if you wish to go that route.
After looking at the menu we settled on the table d'hote offerings (prix fixe for lunch with includes an appetizer, an entree and coffee or tea). The food was good but somehow we expected better or at least we expected to be wowed with every single dish and instead we had different appreciations depending on the dish. The vegetable soup was outstanding, the smoked trout salad in comparison was pale in flavor. The fish dish of the day and the steak frites were good but nothing to rave about, the desserts were outstanding.
So yes I would be back to caffe Cherrier noting that the service was bilingual (a plus if you have non French speaking folks in your party) and the food was solid with a few really good dishes. 
Overall, a good bet when in Montreal for a real French bistro experience."}
{"text":"Great food, good service. Crowded due to popularity, so not as intimate as desired.  Not the choice for a quick meal or dessert, but would be great for leisurely dining and dessert in the evening with friends."}
{"text":"I had probably one of my most upsetting experiences at Café Cherrier this afternoon and I'm extremely disappointed with how the situation was handled. I was sitting on the terrace enjoying the scenery and my food when a camerawoman (who came out from nowhere) started leaning over my table to \"get her shot\". She then aggressively yelled at me to get out of her way-it was loud and extremely rude. Without asking me if this was okay, or forewarning me that the camerawoman needed my table, my belongings and my meal were moved without consent to a table in the corner. My purse was left behind. I had notified servers that my purse was still sitting in the chair and I had to wait until it was returned to me.

The manner that this occurred was abrupt, aggressive, and honestly shocking.

I know the servers probably didn't have control over the woman who was filming, but how the situation was handled was extremely problematic. I received a very dismissive apology for the and my glass of wine was compensated. However, this brusque interaction ruined my dining experience. I did not appreciate being yelled at to move in front of a crowded restaurant by some strange woman with a camera. Moreover, if the staff had been aware of the shooting, I should have been forewarned beforehand that I would need to move, not aggressively jostled to a new place.  If I had been asked politely before this happened, I would have of course obliged. Oddly enough, I never even received an  explanation for the camerawoman in my space when I asked. I asked to speak to a manager about the situation, and was told that this was not possible.

I think what makes the situation worse is I genuinely believe staff would have been more apologetic if I had not been a young woman Black woman dining alone. 

I will not be returning to this establishment"}
{"text":"Bistro français par excellence

La salle a manger est toujours pleine pour l'heure du lunch, alors il faut réserver, même pour deux ! Le café Cherrier a une magnifique terrasse en été qui a l'avantage d'être a l'ombre. Le service est courtois, mais sans plus. La nourriture du menu lunch est toujours fraîche et je sais que je ne serai jamais déçue. 

Les prix sont... un peu cher, disons-le. Le prix en vaut-il la chandelle ? Oui, si vous avez envie d'un petit lunch tranquille, d'un bon vin, d'une belle table au centre-ville et que vous avez un budget moyen-élevé. 

Astuce : les frites et les espressos sont mes favoris. Pour pas trop cher en plus !"}
{"text":"Bad service! As other reviewers have mentioned it was WAY too difficult to get the server's attention for even the simple things like refilling the water glass and getting the check. My boyfriend ordered the flank steak and was never actually asked how he wanted it cooked, however after a substantial wait for the food he finally cut into the middle and it was totally raw! When we were finally able to flag down the server and show her the poorly cooked meat, she said that she had requested it be cooked \"medium,\" but agreed that it was quite raw. She simply apologized and then said that if we told her before she would have put it back on the grill, but it was too late which was only more infuriating since getting her attention was such a challenge. She then cleared his plate leaving the entire center portion of his steak uneaten (a $24 dish) and although no compensation was requested, none was offered either. My veal tortellini was nothing to rave about and the escargot appetizer was underwhelming. 

This place is expensive for the service and quality you are getting.  A short jaunt up the street and you have a number of other fabulous options like L'Express that is in the same price range, but far exceeds the experience at this cafe."}
{"text":"A disappointment!  Upon ordering my croque monsieur, I was terribly surprised how poorly it was made. It lacked freshness, taste, and quality. The authentic croque monsieur has bechamel sauce, good quality cheese and ham. Mine was cold, rubbery and flavourless cheese, stale baguette and served cold with midocre fries. When politely approaching a waitress expressing my negative opinion on the sandwich.. her response was \"The issue is that you don't like it, not a problem of the sandwich\" I was amazed by her lack of professional people skills and how rude she was. Soon after I was offered by another waitress to order another dish. Which I I did. I requested the quiche Lorraine with fries. Luckily it was a bit more pleasing to my belly and palette. Fortunately, the raspberry tart I have ordered was outstanding! A lovely balance of sweet and tart with a generous amount of fresh raspberries. All this to say, the service was poor, the main dishes lacked authentic French taste and freshness. I will be seeking another place when craving French cuisine."}
{"text":"A recent road trip to Montreal took us here - close to McGill, in the plateau/Mont Royal neighbourhood, Cafe Cherrier is a lovely place to dine!

The service was amazing, all staff appeared to be bilingual, there is a beautiful patio, and the decor inside is very \"I'm in paris\".  The crowd is a little older, a little more sophisticated - it's definitely not full of boisterous young drinkers - but it's plenty lively, full of that charming Montreal upscale hustle and bustle. 

With a great wine list, and 4 or 5 beer options (as well as cocktails), this was the perfect place to grab a late afternoon snack and beverage. Also at our table was the cheese plate, and the frits. As cliche as it sounds,try the FRENCH fries, they're beyond delicious. Between that and my Stella, I was in heaven. (There is also a full dining menu, reasonably priced)

Cafe Cherrier was a delight to dine at. Great service, charming atmosphere, delicious food, and blocks away from other restaurants, shopping, and anything else you might be looking for. I think you may even be able to see Heidi & Seal's house across the park..."}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me so many years to try this very well known institute out.
I had breakfast but will surely come back for dinner or even lunch on their corner side terrace with a great view.
The breakfast choices weren't huge but the basic eggs and bacon dishes were very affordable. I enjoyed the duo choices of eggs benny, one with full tomatoes stuffed with ham and eggs and the other with salmon. Dishes came with a great side of baguette.
The service was very friendly and the place was packed."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience. It looks like a nice cafe with a terrasse.  But it was horrible. Here's why: 
1. We were asked to move after sitting down outside  for 15 min  because the hostess didn't bother to ask if we were eating or just having drinks. I don't even know why we had to move for eating, but we didn't want to be complicated so we agreed to move. 
2. The waiter had no knowledge of his alcoholic menu. I ordered sangria and he said he didn't have sangria. Asked for an old fashion and he had no idea what I was talking about. Ordered a cosmopolitan and he asked if I wanted a vodka or gin martini. I was so confused over just a drink! 
3. The only good part of my dinner was the appetizer. Tuna tar tar. No complaints there. Fish was fine. Nothing out of the norm, it was good. 
4. We arrived at 5 ish and received our main dish at almost 630. We were unable to find our waiter several times. Appetizer dishes not cleared, my empty cosmo was only offered a refill at the end of my meal so I said no. And obviously couldn't find him for the bill and even when we did, he took so long I had to leave to get my car while my friend had to front my part for the bill. 
5. Not only did my food take forever to come, it tasted horrible!  It was WAY too salty my brocolini with sausage. All I did was drink water after almost ever bite because we had to leave by 7 and if I returned it, we would have to wait another 45 min probably.   My friend's pork stuffed with blue cheese lacked blue cheese AND was over cooked. Was way too dry. 

This restaurant is worth one star but i will give them their one credit, their appetizer was par. 

Will I come back? Never"}
{"text":"We had a very nice meal at this cafe.  Both my husband and I had salmon encrusted with pistachios.  It wasn't outstanding but was very good.  Accompanying veggies were also really tasty.  Since I'm not such a wine maven, I asked the waiter for a suggestion.  To my surprise, he pointed out what he thought was the best wine but then added that it was too expensive.  Instead, he steered us to the house wine, which we did enjoy very much.  I might add that our server was very courteous and friendly, even though we are English speaking.  There is a nice outdoor dining space but it was just too cold to take advantage of it for dinner.  All in all, I would return."}
{"text":"Cafe Cherrier has a french charm. Its decoration and environment resemble a french bistro. The location is charming but the food however is OK. Looking like a french restaurant does not always mean that food will be out of this world. I have had both breakfast and dinner at Cafe Cherrier and I am always left with the feeling; \"is it just me or could the food be better?\". 

I would take my friends for an evening drink at the bar to experience the ambiance but otherwise I am not rushing back."}
{"text":"Le déjeuner est bon mais sans plus. C'est un brunch très traditionel, tout etait bon mais rien n'etait excellent ! 

Le service etait très bien, mais franchement j'ai été deçu par les plats. Un endroit comme le cafe cherrier qui prétend avoir d'excellents plats et des aliments de qualités ne devrait pas servir des déjeuner aussi simple ! 

Je pourait très bien retrouver un brunch identique à la taverne près de chez moi dans HOMA. ( par contre dans la taverne le lunch serait 5$ ici cest 20$ pour la même chose) 

Bref, je ne reviendrai pas !"}
{"text":"Got croque monsieur without cheese (lactose intolerant). It was not that great, I suggest ordering another dish. The waiting staff was quite friendly and attentive even during the Sunday rush. I like the atmosphere, but the food was not anything spectacular.

I don't recommend the croque monsieur (maybe the cheese makes a huge difference?). Ham was not too fatty though.

Will try a diff dish when I get a chance."}
{"text":"I'm told lots of famous Montrealers go here. I wouldn't know though because I haven't lived here in a long time. 
It's got a bit of an L.A. feel in that people are looking around at each other a lot.
It's not uncommon for two grown men to go to lunch here and sit at a little table, order a bottle of wine, share it, eat, laugh, discuss. Maybe this is what people mean when they say Montreal is European. Cause you certainly wouldn't see that in States.
I love sitting at the counter and I love brunch. This restaurant located just north of the Latin Quarter on Saint Denis is perfect for both. Food is consistently fresh and good. You can order one eggs Benedict instead of two if you aren't famished - I like that. 
A place to leisurely enjoy one of your weekend late mornings. I've sat at the counter deep in conversation until only an hour of daylight was left in the afternoon. Allonge, mimosa, fresh fruit in the middle of winter. Love, love, love it."}
{"text":"Rien d'extraordinaire...si ce n'est une terrasse à couper le souffle!! Magnifique, arborée, bien arrangée.....bref un Must l'été, et surtout très bien placée, à deux pas de la station de métro Sherbrooke!
J'ai teste cette place avec des amies dont l'une d'entre elles se déplaçait en béquilles et franchement la prise en charge des serveurs n'a pas été top! 
Le serveur auquel on a eu à faire était d'une mollesse absolue et ne faisait absolument pas attention à elle...il a même failli la déséquilibrer! 
À part cela, la terrasse est très agréable et on y passe facilement toute une après-midi sans voir filer le temps....
Le menu est varié mais n'a rien d'exceptionnel ou d'original...et les plats sont assez chers! 
Nous avons plutôt opté pour une entrée et un dessert....bons mais sans plus! 
Je ne sais pas si j'y retournerai pour déjeuner! Un petit verre en terrasse suffira!"}
{"text":"Alright, so I'm giving Cafe Cherrier 2 stars because it is inconsistent. 

For breakfast, sure, it knows its stuff and rarely disappoints. However, I came here for drinks and dinner recently, and wow... I was SO disappointed. I think the only aspect of the night that got me through it, and was remotely respectable, was the wine. I, as well as a few others, ordered the bavette, which sounded amazing at the time, but once we received it, ALL of our meat was way overcooked. Meat like that is way too tender to be overdone, and we all ordered it either rare or medium, in turn we all received medium-well and well done. It was the most chewy and stiff meat I have ever eaten. The only thing tolerable on that plate was the fries --another aspect saving this rating from being a 1-star.

Meh. I've experienced WAY better (sorrynotsorry)."}
{"text":"A classic cafe and a 4-star rating is the headline.  Cafe Cherrier is located in the Plateau section of Montreal.  I was in here a couple of weeks ago for a business lunch and I had a good meal and a positive experience.  Cafe Cherrier was easy to have a conversation in and was a good pick for a business meal.  I ordered the confit canard and it tasted just like in France.  I had a cream of squash soup before my meal and it was spot on.  The house merlot was tasty.  The service was better than average.  The atmosphere was perfect and exactly what you would expect at a cafe.  It looked like they had plenty of outdoor seating weather permitting.  I would be a regular if I lived or worked in the area."}
{"text":"Very friendly cafe with mostly French speaking clientele and a lovely outdoor area on St. Denis. The food is fine, nothing fabulous but just fine.  We all ordered off the specials and the seafood was fresh. Staff was happy to speak to us in English.  We wanted a place where casual dress
would not be frowned upon and this was
the ticket. The other recommended places were just too fancy."}
{"text":"Genre de bistrot français, le café Cherrier est très réputé et accueille souvent des gens d'affaires. Il y a souvent beaucoup de monde, surtout l'été!
Les plats sont très bons, d'où les prix un peu plus élevés que certains autres restos du quartier.
Excellent service, décor de bistrot
A essayer :)"}
{"text":"J'ai un faible pour cet endroit très classique. J'y vais surtout pour les déjeuners, qui ont gardés un prix raisonnable. Il y a des serveurs d'expérience, de carrière, et une cuisine toujours constante. Agréablement bien situé, le Café Cherrier est une institution."}
{"text":"Had a great meal as we walked around Montreal, we were lucky to find this French gem.  I had Toulouse sausage, which is a mix of meats, pork, beef and lamb? My date had a nice cut of steak, that was very tasty.  both meals came with fries.  I had a few of the local beers, a wheat beer, that was very good and cold, a welcome relief after flying from sydney to Vancouver then Montreal.  The service was excellent.  The restaurant has an outdoor seating area that looked nice, but was to chilly to sit outside."}
{"text":"Le café Cherrier est une référence incontournable a Montréal si on désire l'expérience du café parisien. Menu du midi et du soir qui propose des classiques comme le tartare ou le rumsteak frites. Carte des vins intéressante qui propose certains vins a des prix très abordables. Service attentionné et quand on prend une table c'est la nôtre pour la soirée, on est jamais bousculé. Un de mes grands favoris"}
{"text":"Boa opção para um Brunch de domingo! 
Só estava cheio qdo fui e serviço foi um pouco lento."}
{"text":"It is our last day in Montreal and we were looking for one last lunch to close out our wonderful trip. We stumbled to Cafe Cherrier and were happy as soon as we stepped in. It was hustling and bustling with a local crowd including some business lunches. Was really interesting to see and observe. Really nice French food lunch. I had the French onion soup which was excellent and a Duck Confit with frites and salad. The salad was fresh and had a light vinaigrette. The duck was cooked close to perfect. Bread was super tasty and wine was light but flavorful."}
{"text":"Cherrier was just fine but not great when we visited on a Saturday morning. My cappuccino was not great, our server was way too busy to give us needed attention, and our food, while good, was nothing extraordinary.

My eggs Benedict was delicious with a well-made Hollandaise sauce, and I must say, the location is charming. I just wouldn't rush back."}
{"text":"Our server was Andree and she was hooooorrrrible!!! And might I add rude as fuck! The food is not worth your time and the service is not worth your hard earned money!"}
{"text":"Love their terrace. Ambience is good. I go there for happy hours, never been yet for a full meal. Nice choices for wine (glass) and the service is always very friendly"}
{"text":"This was a good restaurant in general.  I loved the shrimp tempura and the shrimp-and-guac side dish.   The steaks were good but not excellent.  I didn't pay much attention to that because I was so hot.

The cafe is semi-open to the outside air and has no air conditioning.  It might've been fine if it was more open, because Montreal has the humidity of the bottom of an aquarium in the year 2500 when all the cities have gone underwater.  I drank the water very fast, and they were pretty vigilant about refilling, so I do give them credit there."}
{"text":"Had lunch on a warm sunny saturday. We sat outside on the lovely terrace.  I had the chicken liver salad, which was excellent, my husband had the croque monsieur, which was served opened faced.  He said it was very good,  I had a glass of the Quebecois Rose which was very nice.  The service was attentive and efficient.  It was a very nice restaurant, and especially on a sunny day if you enjoy outdoor dinning."}
{"text":"Had an awesome dinner here on the patio in the front.  Great people watching, and lovely atmosphere.  Menu was VERY limited for a vegetarian, but, my pasta was very tasty and the bread they brought to the table was yummy.  My husband had salmon and said it was good and the bottle of wine our table ordered was very good and relaxing.  The service was fabulous.  Highly recommend, great location."}
{"text":"The service was very slow and the waiters not really friendly. However the food was good but over priced comparing to what you can have in other restaurant around."}
{"text":"Que ce soit pour déjeuner, diner ou même souper, le café Cherrier offre une cuisine simple et un service efficace. Ce café au sens français du terme n'a rien d'extraordinaire et sa réputation se base à mon avis sur sa constance. Jamais n'y est-on mal servi et la nourriture y est toujours bonne. Personnellement, je fréquente la plupart du temps l'endroit pour des rendez-vous et ma commande se limite dans ces cas à un espresso, qui est bien réussi, cela va s'en dire. Une fois, j'y ai soupé et j'ai mangé un excellent magret de canard dont la présentation était vraiment superbe. Je dois toutefois avouer que je n'ai pas mangé à ma faim ce soir-là. Par contre, je recommande d'y prendre le déjeuner, qui est bien simple, mais toujours agréable."}
{"text":"I really would have missed this place had I not been trying so hard to look for it and I'm damn glad I did find it. Cafe Cherrier has a beautiful patio that wraps around the store and is nearly covered up by the abundance of plants and flowers which make it a great place to sit for brunch.

Our brunch was not too expensive (appx $10-14 / person) and the food was pretty good! I can personally attest for the smoked salmon crepe, the amount of cheese and the holandaise sauce with the salmon made it reaallly tasty. They have freshly squeezed juices which was a plus and their service was A+."}
{"text":"Close to Parc Saint-Louis, this French cafe has two rooms, a bar, and covered outdoor seating on two sides.  We ate here for breakfast and also a late supper with friends during our stay in Montreal.  The service and food were very good both times. The first time, at a late breakfast by the sidewalk, we ordered poached eggs with meat and a nice portion of fruit, and an omelette with a large cafe a lait.  Everything was well-prepared and the service was good.  The next time, for a late evening meal, we were joined by three friends from southern France, and sat in the second (quiet) dining room.  Our waiter was quite humorous, which we encouraged, and I think we all had a good time, juggling between cultures and languages.  The soups and salads were good.  We ordered one of the cheaper red wines to share, and it was quite good.  Our friend from Provence, who has been living in Montreal for a year, said this was the first time since he had arrived that he had tasted goat cheese that tasted like he was used to.  I found it strong for my Virginia, US taste, so I shared mine from my salad with him, LOL.  The fish soup and French onion soup and tomato soup of the day were all good.  The daily special pasta was the only entree we ordered, so we can't really judge the entrees.  All in all, I recommend this cafe highly, from our experience."}
{"text":"Got a drink here prior to going to dinner

Atmosphere:
- Nice outdoor wrap around terrace.  Was not too crowded

{"text":"Just arrived in Montreal and this place was recommended by our host. A lovely welcoming experience. Waiter was busy but friendly. He made us feel at home even though we know very little French. We ordered 1 item at a time and loved every one."}
{"text":"Bel ambiance et très pour déguster un hamburger et une bonne  bière fraîche . Le décor est beau ."}
{"text":"Tout d'abord, la première personne qu'on devrait blâmer pour avoir mis les pieds ici, c'est nous. Pour être complètement honnête, on ne s'attendait pas à grand chose. Mais bon... il n'y avait pas de place là où on voulait bruncher! Par contre, on s'attendait pas à si pire. 

Tellement de questions sont passées par ma tête lorsque je mangeais mes \"ufs bénédictine au saumon fumé\". Pourquoi est-ce que la sauce hollandaise est solide et goûte juste le beurre? Pourquoi est-ce qu'on m'a servi du saumon cuit hyper salé? Pourquoi suis-je ici? Vais-je être malade? 

Bref, cette place mérite une étoile parce qu'heureusement, la toast qui venait avec mon déjeuner était ben correct. 

À jamais, café Cherrier!"}
{"text":"We came to this place for brunch a long time ago, but I remember this place to be very French with good atmosphere. Unlike some brunch places where people are squished together. I had the omelette, it was pretty good"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly service, reasonable prices make this a definite 4 star.  Great outdoor seating location."}
{"text":"It was packed when I got there. I had a French toast and it was truly infamous. Service is slow and I even had to pay for the regular coffee. The potatoes were not cooked enough and fruit is not included. The place next door is better, just walk a little bit and you'll get a better brunch."}
{"text":"I'd never been a particular fan of beets but we ordered the beet salad and it was so delicious! All of our food was wonderful and the ambiance was very nice. The entire set up was both classy, old style diner-esque, and had a nice old fashioned but modern vibe (just like the city). 
Chef has daily specials and things seemed to follow the seasons nicely (I believe the beets were either a seasonal offering or chef's choice)."}
{"text":"Restaurant un peu survendu. J'aurais mis une meilleure note si on ne me l'avait pas présenté comme une référence du genre. J'ai pris une quiche lorraine qui n'était pas exceptionnelle (sûrement dû à l'absence de lardons dans le pays) et trop grasse."}
{"text":"My favourite spot for a quick brunch on the weekend. They boast that they have the best Benedict's in montreal and i have yet to taste a better one. They have a beautiful vine covered terrace that fills up quickly so get there early (weather permitted of course). The wait staff are always on point - quick, polite and friendly. I always order the Benedict which comes with your choice of bread or French baguette (also a slice of tomato which is a surprising delight). I've had their creton a few times and it's extremely good. Oh! Also don't forget to order a Bellini if you're feeling fancy. I dropped a star because more than once the hostess over did it with her apologies when she forgot I spoke to her in English. Girl, get it together! I come here almost every weekend and I choose to talk in English because it's my preferred language but please don't act like you killed my dog when you answer me in French by accident..."}
{"text":"I'm a breakfast person.  So Cafe Cherrier was one of the more memorable places I patronized in Montreal.  It's open for lunch and dinner too.  (I can just imagine the people hanging out on the restaurant patio drinking wine and beer on a nice weather day.)  I had their smoked salmon crepe with white sauce for breakfast. Dee-licious! ...And I am not an egg person.  The orange juice is freshly squeezed and the coffee is fabulous which is a big plus...just enough flavor but without the bitter aftertaste that goes with overroasted beans.  The portions are enough for a hearty breakfast with out being too much.  The decor is sleek diner and you can sit at the bar and eat if there isn't a table available...which is where it seems the locals eat.  The prices for breakfast don't break the bank and most come in under $10/plate."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for brunch before we left Montreal. It was a perfect ending. We were recommended by a local friend and everything was perfect here! We got the coffee, OJ, hungry ones, egg Benedict, French onion soup & soup of the day. The bacon in hungry ones was super crispy and tasty. I feel I can eat it all day nonstop! The egg Benedict is very creamy and delicious. I also love the French onion soup, the soup and the burned cheese on the top were great combination. The soup of the day was broccoli cream soup. It was also tasty and smooth. The OJ was fresh squeezed. I don't understand why it's only 3.5 star on Yelp. Everything was so lovely here. I would def come back!
PS. Reservation is high recommended since it's always packed here!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite Montreal restaurants. Every dish I've had here has been worth it (especially the confit du canard), even with the slightly high prices. Wine selection is good, and the terrasse is very nice. Service is a bit surly but knowledgable."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. The prices are according to what you get and the side dishes are substantial.

It has a nice European feel and has a nice terrace."}
{"text":"We enjoyed brunch here - each of us got eggs Benedict and the 4 of us shared the French toast which was made well and already has syrup on it. Coming from NY I'm used to having a side of mixed greens with my eggs Benedict but it didn't come with it so we ordered a mixed green salad to share which improved the dish. Baguette already came buttered and we ordered a side of Brie cheese which was okay (nothing that special). Tried to get to other brunch spots but wait time was an hour and this place had no wait. Can't compare to other brunch spots in Canada but liked it."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a late lunch on the outdoor patio during the first week of June 2010.  The service was good, the food was excellent and the ambiance was nice.  As other reviewers have noted, it does have a European feel.  The salad with chicken livers was excellent as was the goat cheese salad."}
{"text":"Just ordered a cappuccino and it cost me close to 5$! And I wasn't impressed at all by their coffee quality. Their breakfast doesn't look great neither... but the price is relatively fair for a continental style breakfast, around 8$ with tips."}
{"text":"This place had some of the best eggs benedict ever!! The fresh orange juice was phenomenal also!  There was five of us and everyone said it was the best breakfast they ever had!!  The server was very cool and friendly too.  Not sure why some of these people are rating this place so low.  It was a hidden gem, and i am glad we found it!!"}
{"text":"Très beau lieu et la terrasse est très agréable.
Nous avons aimé y bruncher en ce dimanche midi.
Le choix de plat est varié puis on peut combiner les plats.
Le service est très agréable et efficace."}
{"text":"J'y suis allée relativement tôt le matin en semaine pour un petit déjeuner avant le travail. J'ai beaucoup apprécié la tranquillité de l'endroit, le service courtois et rapide, et le wi-fi gratuit qui m'a permis de travailler un peu tout en déjeunant. De plus, la musique française qui joue en trame de fond crée une ambiance vraiment \"café parisien\". 

Par contre, je dois préciser que le repas que j'ai commandé n'avait rien d'extraordinaire. J'avoue que je n'ai pas de très hautes attentes lorsque je commande un \"deux oeufs, bacon\", mais je trouve dommage de me faire servir des toasts quasi-brûlées... Malgré tout, le prix demeure très raisonnable, mon petit-déjeuner complet m'ayant coûté à peine plus de 6$."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place while roaming around Montreal and I'm so glad that we did! It's an excellent choice for breakfast or brunch with lots of menu options (all really inexpensive and delicious). Most of the brunch items were under $10 CAD.

I got two eggs over easy with baguette and bacon. It also came with some home fries and a nice big piece of tomato. Yum! Rus got the same but with sausage (the sausage was really good). Our bill came to only $20 CAD (including coffee).

Service was friendly, food was served up pretty quickly, couldn't have stumbled upon a better place!"}
