{"text":"Had lunch here a few weeks ago - I was quite disappointed in both the quality of the food and the service. 

It was a nice summer day so we went out to the patio which was nice.  We ordered drinks, which came promptly along with samples. And that was the end of the prompt service. We waited over 45 minutes for our food. I asked about half an hour in if the food was coming. The waiter said it would be about 5 minutes. 15 minutes later the food arrives.  We didn't order anything fancy or complex to warrant such a wait. The burger I ordered was mediocre and the fries that came as a side was so small questioned if this was a garnish. 

When we requested our bill that took another 15 minutes to arrive. 

Almost 3 hours later, we finally left - desperately trying to find a chocolate bar because that lunch was not satisfying at all."}
{"text":"I had my husband's 40th birthday dinner at the Beer Hall a couple of nights. I made the reservation almost a month ago. The evening started off alright. The server was friendly and was willing to accommodate separate bills for everyone. After that, things started to go down hill. First of all, why have a beer menu when you only have 4 beers to serve? Seems kind of redundant. That was the least of my problem. The poor girl was overwhelmed. You should not have one server for a table of 22! It took one of my guests to complain to get someone to help her take the order. One part of the table was being ignored. Then, the food didn't all come out at the same time...meaning 1/3 of the table didn't get their food while the rest of us was finished eating. Again, it took another one of my guests to complain. The floor manager was apologetic but ended up throwing one of his staff under the bus. I don't know if this is common practice in the restaurant world, but you never blame your staff like that. I don't care if she was new and should never have been put on our table. Management should be taking ownership of the problem at hand. Even then, another floor manager did not have a friendly attitude. All in all, this was not a good experience. Trying to get our bills at the end of the night was an ordeal as well. The food itself was ok and the restaurant did compensate the guests. Even then, this is not enough to bring any of us back. So disappointed."}
{"text":"Located in the Distillery district, the Mill Street Beer Hall is going to be a welcome addition to the summer patio scene. Brand spanking new and large, the space is gorgeous with its copper beer lines running across the ceiling. 

The menu suggests beer pairings for each of the food items and beer flights are offered at very reasonable prices. The more notable brews include:
Curious Parrot - a lighter beer with some hops - my favourite of the evening!
Helles Bock - really crisp beer which would be perfect for a sunny day
Cobblestone Stout - a perfect alternative for Guinness lovers
Minimus Dubbel - the waitress told us this beer would taste like bubble gum with a hint of banana - what an accurate description
Doppel Pils - another favourite of the evening

To begin, we asked the waitress what the hit dishes were. She was extremely enthused about the Bacon Jam (which comes 2 year old aged Cheddar cheese and grilled baguette). Unfortunately, this dish did not live up to the hype but we used it as a dip for dishes which came later.

Next, we tried the mini lamb and lavender sausage sliders (with caramelized onions, smoked mustard and brioche bun). To quote a certain friend, it felt like \"eating a drawer full of underwear\". The general consensus was that the lavender is quite overpowering,

We also got the pork board (bratwurst, smoked pork belly, apple glazed Frenched pork shank, turnip choucroute, horseradish mustard, candied apples, pretzel twist). This was AMAZING. The pork belly was so tasty and tender. We loved it so much that we got a 2nd pork board. Totally serious. We were especially in love with the mustard so we made sure to emphasize that we wanted extra mustard. Beware... we were charged an extra $1.50 for it.

The roasted beet carpaccio (with burrata cheese, julienne sugar snap peas, crunchy baby beets, pine nuts, basil sprouts, beer reduction, olive oil, Maldon sea salt) was really good. Highly recommended for beet lovers and a pretty good portion size.

The kale and apple salad was a little disappointing. The buttermilk ranch dressing was nothing special and covered up the taste of the kale. The apples are a refreshing touch though.

Lastly, we had the braised short ribs (with house brewed root beer glaze and kale & apple salad). This dish was a huge disappointment! The ribs were way too overcooked and there was not much taste to them. Definitely would not get this again.

We would come back again but would probably just stick with the beers and the pork board. Can't wait for the patio to open and to try their bierschnaps!"}
{"text":"Horrible service with mediocre food.  Bohdan, the waiter needs to learn what is on the menu. Needs to order food promptly. Guests having to ask the bartender what beers are available is inexcusable. Training needs to be ramped up."}
{"text":"We got the pountine and some drinks. It was great. Very cool pub in a great location."}
{"text":"We stopped in during the day when we were on a trip and tried a flight.  There were a few good beers and the service was excellent.  The bartender was helpful in answering any questions we had about where to go and what to do in Toronto."}
{"text":"Service was ok, food was a hit or miss. 

The stout cheddar burger was burnt on the exterior and medium in the centre & it lacked flavour.  It was by far the worst burger I have ever had.  I swapped the fries for the spinach strawberry salad, I have had better.  
The dip with pretzel bun was alright. The pretzel bun was good but we didn't care for the dip.  
The best part of the meal was the pulled pork carnitas.  The waitress said the most popular dishes were the drunken butter chicken and fish & chips.  IF I ever go back I would consider trying one of those two mains and definitely order the carnitas again."}
{"text":"Really delayed service, food came cold, and worst of all, they ran out of beer. It is called the Beer Hall, but barely anything on their beer menu was available. I think I had to point to four beers on the menu before I was finally told that I could get it. Same situation with everyone else at the table."}
{"text":"Such a great place! I've been here 6 times now, both on dates and with large groups. It's a huge venue, with a great interior - so it's good for both. Service is always good, beer is plentiful (obviously), and the food is actually great. Definitely prefer Beer Hall to the old Mill Street Brew Pub...it's getting run down, and its menu is a little boring. All around, I'm always in for the Beer Hall!"}
{"text":"Really like the atmosphere and food here. The main Mill Street Brewery gets filled really quickly, so I'm glad there's a sister pub just right next door. We came here to see the Christmas Market and decided to grab dinner here first. 

We decided to grab pretzels and beer batter fries for appetizers. I love their pretzels here, it's a must try. Even better you ask for more pretzels as long as you don't finish the dip! For beer, I like something stronger and I would recommend the Helles Bock. For those who like lighter beers, I would recommend the lemon tea beer. 

For main, I had the Red Quinoa Salad (~$10), the portion was a bit small if I just had that, but because we had appetizers as well, it worked out perfectly. I also tried the BBQ Chicken Flat bread before and that is a great option as well. This restaurant is also a great choice in the summer days as they have a large patio outside."}
{"text":"I saw a preview of the Mill Street Beer Hall on blogTO, and before I even read the article I knew I had to try it. The term \"beer hall\" reminds me of many fond memories of Europe, particularly the time I spent in Prague and parts of Germany.  

I went on a muggy Saturday afternoon in June. I've always liked the Distillery District but I never enjoyed the crowds on weekends because it made it difficult to find a place to eat. I was happy to learn that the beer hall has ample seating and reservations wouldn't be necessary. The patio was already full when we arrived, but we managed to get a table that was virtually outside since they open the massive doors to the patio anyway. 

I ordered the the charcuterie board, which consisted of three different types of meats with some bread and pickled things. It wasn't the most mind-blowing, outstanding, last-meal-on-Earth type of dish, but it was more than adequate for me. I ordered it with a flight of beer, as was recommended by the menu and our waiter. 

The service was great and consistent, despite how busy they were that day. I spent at least three hours and a few rounds after eating, and didn't even notice the time. Our bill came to just under $100 for two meals and three rounds of drinks. It might sound like a lot compared to other pubs, but where else in the city can you get an outdoor setting, live music (the jazz festival was on), ample beer selection, and good food? I think you have to realize that you are paying for much more than just the food on your plate for places like these. 

I would definitely come back to Mill Street Beer Hall. It wouldn't be a go-to spot on a weekly basis, but it is definitely worthy of a visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This place is the very definition of \"ok\". 

The atmosphere was decent enough, and our server was friendly, but far from attentive. 

First off, they \"lost\" our reservation but managed to seat us at a table not too long after. 

Then, our server just took *forever* to get us anything. The table next to us needed to borrow our menus. Getting drinks, getting to place our orders, and then eventually getting our orders took over an hour. I didn't get my glass of water until at least 35 minutes. 

I ordered the BBQ chicken flatbread. It was ok. It looked nice, but it wasn't very flavourful. And the portion was definitely not worth $15. 

My friend got the steak frites, and the steak was not cooked well, and the fries were barely lukewarm. 

We think it might have to do with our other friends, who ordered the tomahawk steak for 2. It took a long time to prepare so we're thinking our food was sitting around while theirs was finishing (not good planning). The steak came on this impressive skillet loaded with giant cuts of meat and potatoes but the steak itself was pretty fatty (it was still tasty). All it included was the skillet of meat and potatoes plus 2 steins of beer -- for $96. Not worth it in my opinion but my friends seemed to like it. 

Just another example of a mediocre Distillery district restaurant."}
{"text":"Went last night as a party of 6 had the best time....great food, wine, beer and the staff are amazing. Plus it is in the beautiful old Distillery District that is fun and festive especially this time of year."}
{"text":"I had my birthday party last Saturday with about 50 guests for dinner.  Even though the venue is nice, I would not recommend this place for a large party.  I've written about the food and experience below:

I have to say the food portions were quite disappointing, I expected the portions to be larger considering the premium prices for the platters.  The flatbread/tacos seemed like they were served on tiny little chips with toppings dumped on top.  The frite cones especially were quite surprising - there were about 4-7 fries in each cone if even that for each guest.  I didn't want that to ruin my night, so I just went with it - my boyfriend and I even skipped our meals so there would be more for my guests.  I found out the next day that half my guests went to another restaurant for dinner after my dinner because they were still hungry.

Aside from the food, the service was okay (automatic gratuity charge). I wish the serving of the food was more organized, I later found out one table was missing a flatbread platter so I'm assuming it went to another table.  Considering there were only 5 tables to serve amongst 3 waiters, I don't see why it wasn't kept track amongst themselves.  In addition, one of my guests was rejected to order food/drinks at the table because he wanted to pay cash.  He then went to the bar to grab drinks for a few of us, the waitress came up to me and said to order from her instead of going to the bar so she can, I quote \"make some money too\".  I thought that was quite unprofessional but then told my guest to try to order at the table after this round of drinks.  He then told me how he was rejected to order at all because he was paying cash.  I know it may be easier for them to keep track with a credit card or whatever the system may be.  But I did not expect this kind of service at the Beer Hall.  I think after this experience, it's safe to say I most likely will not host another party here myself."}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop if visiting Toronto!  The beer and food are fantastic.  The prices reasonable.  The waitstaff is super friendly.  Sit outside if the weather is nice."}
{"text":"I won't ever be back here. The a/c broke down on a really hot day and not only did management decide they should still stay open, they got the staff to literally lie to customers' faces and tell us the a/c is on and it's just hot. Honestly,  it sucks that this happened but at some point you have to accept that you can't operate this way. One of our party was very pregnant and the heat was just about unbearable.  Would have appreciated getting a phone call to cancel our reso and apologize for the inconvenience; we would have understood.  On top of the awful, apetite-eliminating heat, our server was MIA most of the night so we had a hell of a time getting badly needed drink refills. We didn't end up eating much besides a few apps and only stayed long enough to wait out the torrential rain. The brew pub has always been my go to spot for client lunches and to take visitors/tourists but my opinion of Mill Street has completely changed after this terrible experience"}
{"text":"I came here for a friend's birthday on the weekend and while the food was good and drinks were great, the service was downright rude.

We spent several hours there, and after my food came the waitress seemed to vanish for the rest of the night. I had to order a beer from another server in the area as mine was evidently M.I.A, and not once did she check on our food. Eventually she finally returned and I asked for a water as it's VERY loud in there and you have to shout to be heard. My water never came, and neither did my bill as I waited for almost an hour again just to pay. 

As my friends and I were finally leaving, we were actually confronted by our server who was angry we didn't leave as large of a tip for her. I think we were shocked enough to actually be confronted, let alone that she thought she deserved a large tip. When we explained the lack of service we received, we were told that she was too busy serving a table of 30 men. Not very impressive to me.

Anyway, the food was decent (I had the flatbread and part of the fondue), and I do love the beer selection as I've always been a fan of Mill Street. If you're going for a quick drink I would recommend this place, but don't expect the best service unless you're with 29 other men."}
{"text":"The service and the atmosphere here is great. It's a nice extension to the original brew pub next door. The food tastes good. Good selection of unique beers.

HOWEVER, the entrees are a little high-brow compared to the pub food at said brew pub -- which is fine, save for the $18-$20-range fee and the minuscule portion size. Seriously, the entrees don't come with a side and the portions are tiny. They are clearly trying to get you get loaded up on beer and then push the appetizers on you.

We told our very nice waiter that our portion sizes were far too small for the cost (the \"8oz. Steak\" looked more like 4oz.). They were gracious enough to send one of the bar's managers by, who apologized and gave us a free flatbread pizza, and, they comped one of our entrees.

Basically, we lucked out that night...but I feel like future patrons who don't say anything are going to get fleeced for $$$.

In short: Good buzz on this place right now...but, can they maintain with those prices and portion sizes???"}
{"text":"Worst Caesar, worst service. We were 2 of 8 people on the patio and it took 15 mins to get crappy Caesars and took twice as long to get the bill. I was there waiting 4 times longer than it took to drink the drink."}
{"text":"Always great service and if you like to drink Mill St beer this place is a big win. Service is always on point. My favourite things to eat is the elk burger and the steak. The patio is great in the summer but theres still so much room inside in the winter!"}
{"text":"Fun, but very cramped - the tables are packed like sardines. Standard pub fare, good fish and chips. If you are not sure about the beers, get a flight and see what you like."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch a little over a week ago for the first time with colleagues. We were seated quickly and our waiter was phenomenal. Drinks were fantastic and the menu was decent. Knowing how much my husband loves Mill Street beer, I went home and told him all about this place and he was super excited to check it out so we paid a visit this past Sunday (Aug 14). What a disaster. We were seated quickly enough but then it was like they just forgot about us. It wasn't even a busy time! This was like mid-afternoon. Eventually we moved inside to the bar where we were ignored by the bartender until we stopped her and asked for a menu. She then mentioned that most of the beers were unavailable because someone left something open and a lot of the beers were warm and it would be a while before they cooled down and could be served again. The beer was the main reason for us being there so we left. The only reason I'm giving them 3 stars and not 2 is because my first visit was a 4 star experience. My husband wants to go back but I'm not sure I'm on board unless they can get their act together."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night with some friends, I accidently first walked into the Brew Pub, and I immediately loved the warm inviting atmosphere. I wasn't so impressed with the look of the Beer Hall. I found the long table setting to be awkward- it's difficult to hold conversations. 

Food is okay. We shared a charcuterie board, which was decent. My elk burger wasn't anytning special. We actually ordered dessert- it was awful. The beer, however, was pretty good. I just had the Belgian Wit. 

Service was okay. 

I would return for drinks, but not food."}
{"text":"Fun place to come with friends for decent food and great beer. We took advantage of the Winterlicious deal. Pakora appetizer was tasty - pasta entree was mediocre at best - waffle ice cream sandwich was an enjoyable dessert. Music seemed excessively loud, so it was hard to hear conversations at the other end of the table. Overall I'd rate it 3-3.5 stars."}
{"text":"We came in and were seated quickly.  That's where our story ends. We sat for 15 minutes reading the menus and no one ever came to take orders. We weren't even offered drinks.  There were a lot of servers walking around ignoring us. As we were leaving the couple next to us said they'd been waiting 20 minutes for their bill."}
{"text":"I provided my credit card to the waitress and at the end of the night, was informed that the card was lost.  Had to call my bank and there were already unauthorized charges on the card that same night.  Called the Beer Hall the next day and talked to a manager, the waitress in question said she talked to me and that I said everything was fine, which it is obviously not.  Manager said that she would talk to the waitress and would call me back.  As of 12 hours later, I still haven't heard back or gotten an explanation of how my credit card information was stolen."}
{"text":"This place sucks in terms of food. Don't even think of trying the duck. 

Other places nearby might be a better option for food. 

Service is okay."}
{"text":"We came here after reading the glowing review of this establishment on Blog TO (http://www.blogto.com/restaurants/mill-street-beer-hall-toronto) and we were not disappointed. To start, we tried a flight of beers including Tankhouse and an excellent white beer. The price is right at only $8.25 for four 6 ounce glasses and it is a great way to sample a variety of beers. Next, we decided to try the charcuterie board on the basis of what we saw in the review but when it arrived, it did not appear to be anything like what was described. We talked to the server and he explained that what we really wanted was the pork board but that it was not on the lunch menu. Regardless, he not only took back the charcuterie board but managed to get us what we wanted despite the fact that it was a special order. We were both impressed by the server's accommodation and were overall very pleased with the service."}
{"text":"Oh Mill St! What a disappointment this Sunday :( it was my fifth visit and I have always enjoyed myself hence the return trips but boy what a let down! We were greeted by a very rude hostess (she should spend some time with our waitress working behind the bar - lovely!) and found our own table outside. Whilst the beer was great, the food quality was yummy - what is up with the portion size of the beef tacos? I'm not a mouse! I will be back because I've had some great times here but being ripped off is not acceptable with so much choice in Toronto."}
{"text":"So...
After the GM messaged me, obviously to make things look better on here, nothing happened. 
I actually called there. Twice. She was NEVER available and did not return my calls.

We live in Distillery and are members of a neighborhood association. We made sure the community is aware of a wonderful establishment, that opened recently.

It's not enough their service is horrible, the waitress was down right rude and offensive.

Who calls a guy you've never seen before and who is your guest \"Daddy - O\"???
I understand I'm older than her, but I'm 35 and I pay her salary.

Bottom line - there are loads of great places in Toronto, and Beer Hall is NOT one of them. Don't waste your time and money, and if they will continue this way - they will be replaced soon."}
{"text":"Want to spend your whole morning seated at a restaurant- this is your place. Initially meant to eat at Archeo only to find out they no longer serve brunch and our party wanted breakfast so the Beer Hall was our next pick. Waited about 5 minutes to be seated which was great with the Christmas Market in full swing.

Starved and thirsty- we chose our dishes right away. Our server arrived about 10 minutes after being seated with a beer sample- enjoyed that. Overall rude, unfriendly, and not knowledgable about the menu offerings. Friend asked if fries could be swamped with a side salad- got the eye roll. The server indicated he would check but couldn't guarantee the kitchen had greens- really no greens?! A simple no modifications would do if that was the case. Asked for water to start and it never arrived until we asked once again.

About 50 minutes in and no check ins our food was yet to arrive. I flagged down our server, barely looking at us, said it was on it way out. About 5 minutes later, my friend asked for the manager  indicating the poor level of service and wait time. The manager apologized, checked on the food and said she would personally bring it out the table- appreciated as at that point service was appalling. Food arrived and I honestly thought I was missing a dish- the meal barely took up half the plate. I ordered Salmon eggs benedict- pretty standard dish. What greeted me was water running down my plate, rubbery eggs tasting of vinegar with a firm egg yolk and cold limp fries. The only part of the dish somewhat edible was the smoked salmon. 

Cutlery was dirty had to ask for another set. At that point the manager indicated she would cover the meal and apologized again for the service. 

While picking at our food, two other tables complained about the service and wait times- one couple walked out midway through their meal. 

Our party arrived prior to the lunch rush with the resto not entirely full so I couldn't understand the reasoning for the ridiculous wait times.

I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This place was truly terrible. We had a new server who had obviously not being trained enough to handle a 5 top on a busy night. 

Service: The waitress forgot to put my drink in the order so I got it after the food had arrived. Every time we asked for something or made a mistake she apologized saying that the restaurant is really full. When we asked for some food to be exchanged (because they hadn't list spicy ingredients and the food was for a 2yo) she said we would have to repurchase. She charge every refill of soda as a new soda (unsure if this is restaurant policy or her mistake - but even if it's restaurant policy you should warn the costumer). We asked her to split the bill in a specific way and she did it wrong. 

Food: It was in no way worth the hassle. We had the marguerita and bacon and spinach pizzas. They were just O.K. not necessarily worth $20. The beer cocktail I had was \"west coast\" at any other restaurant I would have sent it back because it was awful, but I really just wanted to eat and leave. Not worth it! 

Ambience: 
It was sophisticated and nice (we were in the newer section of the restaurant). But it did get really loud in there and at one point we all were just tired of music + noise 

Overall, def not ever coming back here again"}
{"text":"This place is delicious, not to mention not bad on the pocketbook especially in this city. We shared the pretzel (which is HUGE), the chorizo chicken pot pie with a delicious green salad on the side, and their wild berry cheesecake. Everything was superb and our service was excellent."}
{"text":"Came here for the Toronto Christmas Market and stopped for a late lunch. It was very busy and we had to wait about 25 mins to get a table, but once we were seated there was prompt service. I had the steak ponzu bowl. Beware of this dish it is extremely spicy, and it's cold not hot. I asked for no chilies and it was still way too spicy, I sent it back. Got the mac & cheese instead, it was really yummy! The waitress was great, she took the other dish off our bill and rushed my mac & cheese. Great service. 

My mother in law was having a hard time deciding on what to get as she is celiac, but when she asked a question about a menu item the server immediately said \"Do you want the gluten free menu?\" My mother in law was so relieved. Again great service."}
{"text":"Great food ( LOVE THE JERK CHICKEN ) super juicy. Great ambiance. Good music. Only thing is slow service. Otherwise 5 stars."}
{"text":"I get the feeling that a lot of people downvoting this place are way too snooty when it comes to expectations. 

While the Beer Hall may not set the world on fire, I found my experience there last night to be great across the board. Sure, there are a few minor quibbles, but I judge restaurants and businesses based on a combination of factors. That a restaurant may have overpriced food is a minor point if the location, service and ambiance makes up for it.

My friends and I were searching for a restaurant in the Distillery District when we happened upon this place. Faced with some ridiculous wait times to get into some of the other restaurants (2 hours? REALLY?), we settled for a 45-minute waitlist and loitered around for a friend to show up. It became clear that it was worth the wait as soon as we got inside.

I will point out that while some of the food may be overpriced, I've been to plenty of restaurants (including two days ago, as of this writing) that try to charge upwards of $30 just for apps, so having entrees that run from $20-40 is not surprising in the least. Everyone was well taken care of, and despite the concerns I've read here about the service, our waiter was a helpful individual who even put up with us switching seats on occasion (throwing the delicate numbering system he had for each diner out of whack).

After all, this is the Distillery District. You're paying to sit in a heritage site, just down the street from Soulpepper Theatre (shout-out to my boy William Webster). It's just part of the area.

I ended up going for the Raspberry Lemonade ($9) and the Hopped-Up Mac'n Cheese ($14). The portion sizes are big, and the lemonade is deceptively strong - I was feeling extremely buzzed even after sipping it. Don't shotgun that one. The Mac'n Cheese was impressively messy, and I soon understood why they serve it with a spoon. It's incredibly difficult to scoop the long pasta noodles out with a fork. The garlic butter biscuit it was served with tasted stale, though I'm not sure if it was intended to be that way or it had sat out too long.

My friends had a mix of flatbreads and salads, and all reported them to be excellent. I also had the chance to try some of the peach cider, which was also deceptively strong. It tastes like iced tea but is much more powerful than it lets on.

This may quickly become a favored destination in the Distillery if the staff can keep the quality of service as high as they did last night. The experience was great overall, and I've been left with lingering memories of the pleasant atmosphere as the sun set and the great times with friends.

The Beer Hall is well worth a look if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I go to the distillery often as I live in the area.  After a few unfortunate eating experiences at the brew pub last year I thought I'd try the beer hall.  Overall my visit was good.  The severs were friendly and attentive and I like the selection of beer.  I felt the menu was a bit lacking in terms of selection.  I had the fish taco which was great, although a little pricey for the size of the portion.  Will go back though, I love the outdoor patio in the summer."}
{"text":"This spot is good for some beer and some sun.
 I know you don't go to a brewery or pub for great food but when both the fries and sweet potato fries are soft and bland, it's not cool. I like my fries fried. The chicken on my salad was waaay too dry and the salad didn't have any dressing or taste to it. 
At least they have a good selection of beer and even various wines to choose from. 
The atmosphere is fun and I have nothing bad to say about the service, just wished they'd put a bit of effort into the food for the price point."}
{"text":"NEW SISTER RESTO TO MILL STREET PUB OPENS 
When is the Distillery going to get some good food
New sister resto to Mill Street pub that just opened is the pits .. yes great atmosphere but the food is horrible, overpriced and the service is brutal... same chef as Mill Street Pub so really did we get anything new NO!
We have a Boiler House that has been close under reno, same owners are Pure Spirit so same calibre of food .. poor and poor service 
Then less than average Italian at Archeo (lots of weddings here but really food is nothing better than East Side Marios and much more expensive) and bad tapas at Tappo (don't even know where to start with comments) .. please help us chefs of Toronto"}
{"text":"Pathetically long wait. Hostess acted clueless. She estimated 30 minutes and I'm not sure we would have even been seated after nearly an hour of waiting had we not asked a couple of times. She has no ability to estimate time. And clearly there were empty tables in the restaurant. To top it off, their beers were not good. We like our beers, but I didn't think these were good!"}
{"text":"Decent outdoor seating area and a nice location to grab a beer and people watch. The atmosphere is always lively. I didn't have the food so I can't judge. However, this place gets 2/5 for as a brewpub. 1. They don't really carry any unique beers outside the one that you can get at LCBO. The whole point of visiting the brewery is to try unique stuff that you can't get. 2. Servers don't spend any effort to explain their beer menu. Interacting with the brewery's staff to learn about their beers is the key experience of visiting the brewery in the first place. 3. Just the whole presentation and approach of the place is not focused on their 'products', which are the beers. This place is setup to be more like a regular bar and restaurant, and it offers zero in terms of a real or decent brewery experience. 

Mill Street is getting too big and generic. There are plenty more intimate brewpub experience in Toronto...not to mention better beers too."}
{"text":"Service was very slow.  Followed by a horrible meal. Schnitzel was overcooked, thin, and tough.  Cabbage was  vinegar soaked and German pasta hard and dry.  We were a table of eight and no one was pleased with the over priced meals.   We were directed here when the main pub was full. Big mistake"}
{"text":"Prices are on the high end of $$. The poutine was ok, def not worth $15. Spinach dip was good."}
{"text":"I make it short and sweet for you all! Terrible food! Disgusting! Chicken schnitzel was completely burnt! Tasteless potatoes on the side!!! Curry chicken salad had absolutely no chicken, no curry flavor! Hot sausage flat bread was extremely spciy even though i asked her and she said a little spicy!!! Service was terrible as well! Please save your money and time!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero I would. 

I wish I could comment on the food or drinks but we never got acknowledged or served.

When we arrived there was no hostess and the bar was completely unattended, even though there were 8 people at the bar. No servers to be seen either. The bartender came from the kitchen with nothing but her Starbucks drink in her hand. 

The whole one she had four pints just sitting on the back bar. When she got back she gave them to people at the bar, who had clearly been waiting for them while she went on her Starbucks smoothie run. 

We seated ourselves and not once were we greeted or acknowledged. We left 15 min later. Never again. Worst service EVER"}

{"text":"My date took me to the lovely distillery district for valentine's day and we came here for their special menu. It was a very nice contemporary romantic setting. Our waitress was extremely nice and very knowledgeable about the beers. My date called ahead and told them I don't eat seafood so they adjusted the first course for me. Each course including the palette cleanser came with a beer. I also was a Lil drunk after my meal. The first course was a potato soup and a cold soup. The cold soup was an interesting flavor but not anything crazy. The warm soup was really delicious and I love creamy soups. The beer was nice and light. The second course was the duck. It had a very Asian taste to it. I'm not a huge fan of duck so this was just ok for me. The beer with this was a darker one and bitter. Then we had a palette cleanser and it was hard to eat out of the glass because it was frozen. It came with a shot of something that felt like I was shooting tequila. Had to wash it down with water. The next course was a beef and lamb. The beef was in duck fat so wasn't a huge fan. The lamb was very delicious and my favorite part. The beer had a coffee taste to it that wasn't too bad. For dessert the beer was pretty good and another dark one. The chocolate ganache was incredible. There was part of the dessert that tasted like ras malai and I wasnt a huge fan of the flavor. Overall it was a nice experience. Because it was a tasting menu though the portions were extremely small. Would come back but for drinks."}
{"text":"Mill street beer hall remind me of why I love the distillery district. It's tucked in there a little hidden and has the lot beautiful layout as design. It has exposed  brick, large tables, and a wide selection of beers to drink on tap. This place is ideal for beer drinkers, however be warned it's definitely more tailored for beer drinkers than wine or cocktails. They have very good pub grub options perfect to pair with the drinks. It's a little out of ideal transit as most places are with the distillery district, however, that's also why I love it and makes it feel like a hidden gem and almost lovely!"}
{"text":"Food is very average. Not worth it. Only decent thing we had was the poutine. Our server was horrible. She was not friendly and was hard to get service from her. Bad service ruins the experience. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Ahh, I don't come downtown often enough to know all the good spots, but this one was pretty cool. A huge patio area and nice neighbourhood, could probably take a few more trips down to the Distillery District. 

A nice spot to grab some food and drink late at night. Came here in walking distance of an evening out already, and ended up sitting down for some late night grub!

Food seemed a but over-priced, but have to take into consideration where you are I guess. Got the Margherita Flatbread and Perogies, which were both quite good. Wanted something a little lighter, so the flatbread was quite nice. Fresh and zesty, making it a nice snack. The perogies were actually amazing, nice flavour inside and the skin on the outside was good too! Way overdid the sour cream though!

Service was great, as he was super friendly, talkative and easy to approach. Good attention to our table as well. 

Not a bad place to take it easy and enjoy the night, as there is that huge patio and lots of space! Wouldn't mind coming back here in the future!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this location for a few years. The menu items have changed over time and it's just the cost of doing business: keep things interesting, find higher margin yet lower cost options, stay competitive. I'm still a fan of their steak cobb salad and nachos but it's hit and miss unless the server / manager puts in a good word. The real stars of this location are the beers - Mill Street knows how to make excellent beer and the servers and managers of this location get these items to you quickly and efficiently with a wink and a smile. As a tourist hot spot and a pre-theatre dinner, Mill Street can still hold its own but it's a bit like watching 70 year-old Stallone playing Rocky Balboa - you still cheer for him but it's more nostalgic than realistic if he wins."}
{"text":"Great place in terms of location and layout. Food is just glorified bar food. Had the salmon and had to return it as it tasted terrible. Got the ribs and were just OK, not very juicy, extremely dry. Manager came by to follow-up on service so that was good but service was also just OK. Go for a beer and the view but not of your starving."}
{"text":"Nice place. Sampler platters of beer, decent food, nice ambience, lots of room. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Had a super fun night here Friday night (just a couple days ago). My friend and I had just driven in from Rochester, NY, basically in a blizzard, and missed our 7 pm reservation by a whole hour. Our host where we were staying called on our behalf and they agreed to respect the reservation, so we walked in around 8 pm and were taken direct to our table in the bar.

We had a great waitress, Bryn (?) who helped us pick beers for our flights, and provided extra details about the poutine that we each ordered as our entrees: the cheese curds are cold though the fries, gravy and brisket are hot....isn't that always how poutine is served??

We loved the very American roots-rock music selection played by the DJ, thought the noise level was acceptable, and enjoyed our conversation with Bryn, our beers and our meal. (The single serving of poutine is massive - enough for two people - and is super rich and totally decadent!) 

By the way, the beer flights come in 6 oz and 8 oz options, which we also appreciated, and the atmosphere was very lively and young. I would go back in the summer to enjoy the outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"Good service, neat atmosphere, but the food part was a bit misleading.

I was very happy with the variety of Mill Street beers they had on tap, as I finally got to have the doppel pils again, after searching everywhere for it. It was a busy night, but the server was still quite attentive. 

The only issue I had with the place is that maybe they should be more upfront about the menu being more of a tapas thing. I ordered the tiradito, which was raw rainbow trout in a rich, creamy (but dairy free!) sauce. When I got it, I was surprised that that was literally it. No side. Plus the portion was a bit small.  The server did mention that the menu was good for sharing, but in my opinion, ALL menus are good for sharing. It might have been good to mention that the \"entrees\" don't come with anything and that if you want to make it a full meal, you need to order a side separately. That way, our group would have ordered more intelligently. I was pretty starving after, but filled up that spot with yummy beer. The tiradito was VERY VERY good.

So this is a good spot to have some brews and snack a bit, but be ready to shell out a bit of dough if you want a full dinner."}
{"text":"If you want good craft beer, this is your place. I just had two different kinds of German lagers; they also have several IPAs and stouts on tap,with a witbier and some seasonal beers. The price is fair, 7.50 Canadian. The brewery is situated in old distillery that had been remodeled and contains multiple establishments.  Great decor which alone makes the visit worthwhile.  Good service and great ambience.  This is the reason you come to a traditional beer hall. Food is expensive for what it is.... basically pub grub. Nonetheless the beer and surrounding area make the visit a must."}
{"text":"Stopped here this past weekend when my parents were in town for a visit.  We've been to the pub next door several times, but were eager to try something new. 

What a beautiful space inside! Loved the open, clean and modern feel, and of course it helps that everything is shiny and new : )

We were only in the mood to snack, so we ordered the cheese fondue, frites, and of course, beers. 

The fondue was presented beautifully and everything was delicious. It fed 4 people without a problem, so at $25, it was a good value. The fries were done to perfection, and while I wasn't a fan of the frambozen \"ketchup\" (in quotes for a reason) the lemon tea aioli was very good. 

There are a few beers offered only in the beer hall (not next door), which we were happy to try- the most delicious being the Minimus Dubbel. Careful, though...it packs a punch!

Overall a great experience. I can't wait to come back and try dinner. The prices are a little steep, but if the quality is as good as what we experienced, then i think it's fair. 

The big disappointment of the visit was that they are still waiting on the LLBO and aren't allowed to serve their bierschnapps yet. I have a feeling that once that nectar starts flowing, they may earn their fifth star!

Tip: Due to the size, seating configuration, and ability to make a reservation, this would be a PERFECT place to come with a large group, which I find to be a rarity in the city! Also, patio not done yet, but it looks like it's going to be lovely!"}
{"text":"We only came for drinks as Mill Street brews some ok beers and since I had some out of towners with me I thought the distillery district was a good place to hit up.

This hall/bar/restaurant has a really good vibe.  They have some long tables that can seat up to 10 or more and they have several of them so big groups here shouldn't be a problem.  There's pipes going from what looks like to be a brewing type mechanical thing to the taps.  I didn't ask about them and now I sort of regret it.  Besides that our server brought us a sample of some spicy seasonal brew they had but I just went with the old trusty Tankhouse.

There are a good variety of beers to be had here and while we didn't order anything to eat I wouldn't be afraid to try at a later date.  We had plans to eat elsewhere and we were only around for the beer this time around.  This place has been around for about 2.5 years so I was told.  I haven't been to the distillery district in ages...  I would have remembered this part."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best brewed beer! Gave them 4 instead of 5 because we were waiting for 10 minutes for a table when there for over 5 tables empty. Service is a little slow but everyone is very nice."}
{"text":"Amazing beers here, including many that you cannot find outside the beer hall. They even have BeerSchnapps--a new trend which is a must-try (it's distilled from beer.. comes with a very strong roasted barely aroma and you can even pick out the hops). That said, with so many great beers to choose from, good service is a necessity.

Our service was slow and sterile. Didn't see anyone for the first 15 minutes or so upon arrival. Took a very long time to receive the first drinks. Admittedly they were delicious but service counts for extra at a taste room/beer hall/brewpub.

A worthy stop if you're in the Distillery district but I can't recommend closing your night out here."}
{"text":"It was okay! We went last week and the food was pretty good and expensive ! The beer was good. I loved the fries !"}
{"text":"It was a nice place.  The menu had a variety of interesting foods, and I especially liked trying their fruit beer when it came on a flute tray.  Just kind of expensive generally, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday party with a bunch of friends. Was surprised how big the place was and how nicely renovated it is. You can definitely come here if you have a large gathering but don't expect good food. I mean people usually come here for the beer right? I ordered the salmon rice bowl and my fiancé ordered the beef tenderloin skillet. The salmon bowl looked nice but didn't live up to the price, there was no flavour and the salmon seemed overcooked. My fiancé had salad to accompany his beef tenderloin and it was so salty that he could barely eat it. The tenderloin itself also lacked flavour. We asked the rest of our friends how the food was and they all agreed the same that it was just mediocre. I also wanted to mention that the birthday boy ordered the BBQ platter but was disappointed to find out they have no ribs. I mean, c'mon how can you run out of ribs on a Saturday night?! Just completely failed on food. I think if you come here to eat you might be safe ordering appetizers."}
{"text":"The Food and The Drinks:
Originally, I ordered the Tiradito which is trout with a yellow pepper sauce, but when it arrived, there was a strand of hair in it. I told the waiter and he immediately apologized and not only did he offer to exchange it for a new one, he asked if I would like to order a different dish, which I thought was very thoughtful. Since the dish looked rather bizarre,(picture a rectangular dish with yellow sauce on it; you couldn't see the fish because it was under the sauce) I took him up on the offer and went for the Green Thai Curry Mussels. What a good choice! The bowl of mussels was quite big and the portion quite generous. The mussels were fresh and plump. The sauce was very tasty and it came with some bread for you to dip into the soup afterwards. When my friend asked for some more bread, the waiter gave us the choice of either paying to get the same kind of bread or he could give us a different kind for free. We opted for the free one. It was just nice that he let us choose. My friends and I also ordered beer. For a set price, you can order a sampler of any four beers you want, so go wild and try something you haven't tried before.

The Place:
I really liked the layout and the vibe of the place. There was music playing, but it wasn't too loud. Everything was very clean and spacious including the bathrooms. The decor was modern. I went with a group of around 15 people and got a long table that could have accommodated an even larger group. 

The Service:
As mentioned before, we were all very pleased with the service that night. The waiter was extremely attentive and came back many times to make sure everything was ok. The only drawback was that their WiFi wasn't working. Oh well, more time to socialize with your friends face-to-face.

The Verdict:
Would I go there again? Yes, for the mussels. YUM!"}
{"text":"The outside experience was really cool. We loved sitting by the fireplace. Really cozy and warm. 
Service was terribly slow. It was not busy. We waited for our table inside to get wiped down (food and dirty glassware), but it didn't get cleaned. My boyfriend said lets sit outside and I'm glad we did.  Lovely ambiance outside."}
{"text":"The pizza did not impress me at all. I had the dry cured pepperoni pizza. The crust was nothing special and could have been more well done. There could have been more tomatoe sauce on it as well. There menu items are over exaggerated, labelling the French fries as 'DF Frites' and describing them as: fresh cut and double fried in rendered duck fat with a spicy orange aioli. LOL..These fries sucked! Reminded me of your typical frozen store bought shoestrings. Duck fat my backside :) geez"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner Sunday after checking the Christmas Market. Apparently there are two Mill Street restaurants, they told us this \"Beer Hall\" one is more German style food, while their other \"Mill St Brew Pub\" is more pub/bar type food. We decided to go for this one.

I will echo on some of the other reviews in that their service isnt the greatest. The waiter did not seem interested in serving us. His mood worsened when we asked for just water first before deciding on any drinks. At the end, when we asked for the visa machine, he didnt acknowledge he had heard us, so obviously we asked again and he said in a non-caring rude manner \"Yeah I got it\". Thanks?

The food here is A-OK hence they are really 3 stars but minus one for service. Elk burger was good, duck fat fries served semi-cold, and the curry chicken on greens lacked chicken (fried chickpeas were amazing though). Wouldn't come back unless other restaurants in the distillery district have long wait times. Recommend Clunys nearby if you want some good fushion French cuisine which also isn't much more expensive."}
{"text":"I went here for a Yelp Secret Supper event.  While I loved the atmosphere and the company, I found the food was decently tasty, but it wasn't anything out of this world.  

App: Fish taco - I liked the overall flavour of it as it was a bit tangy and it smelt great, but I think the fish was slightly overcooked.  2.5/5

Entree: Pasta and a large short rib.  The short rib was delicious as it was fall off the bone and the pasta was hand made as well.  Not too shabby 3.5/5

Dessert: I'm not a big sweets fan, but these were absolutely delicious.  Three medium sized deep fried donuts topped with lots of sugar and a raspberry sauce (I think) below it and on the side was some fruits dipped in chocolate.  Amazing.  5/5.  

So overall, food was 3.6/5.

As for the service, J.P. was a great server and had good interaction with the group.  So 4/5 for that dude.  

The atmosphere, while it looked nice, I found that sound traveled too much and it was too loud so it was hard to hold a good conversation.  It could have been the overall crowd's fault, but still, way too loud for me.  2.5/5

This averages out to 3.3/5 and I would say this is a good place to come for drinks if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Located in the Distillery District in Toronto, a national historic site that combines dining and shopping among the remains of the Gooderham & Worts Distillery, this restaurant combines both an outdoor patio and a modern brewpub. Inside, on one end of the long restaurant, fans were cheering on the local team. On the other end, curtains closed off a private party. Curiously, the restaurant was only half full, for a Friday evening during the summer. 

We joined a dinner that was already in progress both hungry and exhausted. Most had not had dinner yet, instead had nibbled on a variety of appetizers before we arrived. So I was able to sample a charcuterie platter and enjoy a flavorful pâté (so good we scraped the jar clean) spread on crostini while catching up with family and deciding on the entrée.

In the end, I liked the grilled swordfish, served with couscous and sautéed greens. It was both hearty and tender - not spicy, despite being marinated in Sriracha yogurt - and served with a thick and creamy peanut sauce. The separate order of fries was a plate of golden-brown deliciousness.

Service was odd. When we requested a new fork to replace the one that dropped, we were given an obviously dirty (not semi-dirty or even \"dirty if you look carefully\" dirty) fork."}
{"text":"Please note that I am writing this review for my LATEST DINING EXPERIENCE ONLY. 

I live relatively close to the Distillery and have always loved coming to Mill Street Beer Hall. The food is not the greatest of all time, but I have always come back for the great service. 

Unfortunately, my visit on Wednesday Aug 24 was just disheartening. I went with a friend for afternoon drinks after a long and sad day and was looking forward to the USUALLY great service I have always encountered at the Beer Hall.. 

Unfortunately, it was quite the opposite. We both work in the service/hospitality industry so we know how stressful it could get at times... but we walk in and made eye contact with the servers/hosts/bartenders and did not receive even one smile or acknowledgement of our presence so it was a reeeeally awkward first few minutes. 

The host that led us to our table was talking to us with a pen in his mouth...... ummm what? I really did not understand this. Was this a concept he was trying???? An #AESTHETIC???? We were very confused..... Like no harm done dude, but I felt the need to state this as we were just very curious and a bit wierded out.... He also looked sort of in pain, but like the artistic angry pain, like \"It's me against the world\" type of pain. Sir, if you ever come across this review....... I hope you are feeling better :) But yeah, this led to another cringy/awkward moment as we walked to our table because the host was just confusing. But no harm done!! 

It was our server that was disappointing. Oh Jesse.... we tried really hard to like you!!! I am so sorry. You seem like a really nice guy, but unfortunately, we weren't too pleased with the lack of attention. In the end, we even asked him how busy it was ( if he had a lot of tables to look after I would understand the neglect....) but he even said how \"the place was dead\". 

The highlight of our encounters with Jesse was us trying to make awkward eye contact and waving because a bee fell into my friend's beer and we wanted a new glass..... but he was too busy flirting and trying to put his arm around another server (blonde with sunglasses). Don't get me wrong... you guys were cute and we wish you all the luck but we just wanted to drink our beer in a new glass. :( 

We had the Belgian Wit for drinks. 10/10 I love Mill St beer. 

My friend had the Mac And Cheese and Sweet Potato Fries. She was not pleased with either, she said they were too plain. I tried the biscuit that came with the Mac & Cheese and TBH, it was stale and whack. The sweet potato fries are always a safe choice though. So rating for food was like 5/10 

Like I still suggest you guys give this a try though!!!!! Maybe it was just an off day for them.... who knows."}
{"text":"Awesome outdoor space and large enough for groups, but it was pretty crowded when I went so imagine you'll want a reservation with a large party. I had the fish tacos and they were really delicious, full of unique flavors. The service was pretty slow though, I guess because it was crowded. It took about 18 minutes for our first drinks to arrive after we ordered and almost 15 minutes to get the check. It could have been because it was busy, but if that's the case they should have staffed more people. 

Overall, enjoyable though considering how nice the space is."}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times during the Christmas Market/ Light festival and once in the summer. They change up their menu sometimes but the DF frites are always a go to, and this time we tried the roasted cauliflower dip and it was really tasty! Its one of the few places in the Distillery District where the wait time isn't over an hour, and the service is always top notch!  4 instead of 5 stars because the music is a bit too loud for my liking."}
{"text":"1 star for the absolutely worst service we had from this miserable waiter that work Saturday night. He had such an awful unfriendly personality. We came out for a good night out but this guy totally ruin it. He told us that he hate this job and hate being there. Why the heck do u employ ppl like this to work customer service?"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is amazing. Was up here for work and was recommended by a coworker to venture over to Mill Street Beer Hall. After a long walk through the city I worked up quite and appetite and was ready to pig out by the time I reached Mill St. 

Mill Street features a phenomenal beer menu and give you the option to have four 6 oz. beers at once in order to get a taste of the variety. On Wednesday there was a deal where you could get a pizza and one of these for $19. Took me about .4 seconds to decide on that deal and threw in some pretzels for good measure. 

In addition to delicious food and drinks, the setting of this bar is absolutely beautiful. For starters, the entire Distillery District is beautiful and is a must-stop regardless if you live 5 minutes or 5 hours away. The patio was bumping amazing tunes and I was able to enjoy a beautiful Canadian summer evening while enjoying my dinner. Would highly recommend this to all, enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good beer with friendly and helpful bartenders. Brandon at the Beer Hall was especially informative about the Mill Street history, beer making techniques and descriptions of their many brews.  Good food menu as well.  An exceptional patio with comfortable chairs and tables invites groups, friends and couples to enjoy the Toronto Summer weather over a beer."}
{"text":"It's a really nice place.  The patio is wonderful.  It's clean and welcoming.

Service was spotty.  

We ordered the fish tacos and they were unremarkable.  Ordered the DF Frites and they were the same.  Beer was great.  The caesar was great too.

I will probably go back there again in the future if I'm in the Distillery District just to enjoy the patio and maybe try some of the other menu items.  Not sure if it's a place I would go out of my way to visit again though..."}
{"text":"There is no option for a zero star... This place has gone to the crapper as far as service is concerned... 10 minutes after having seated ourselves we get the menu and only after I asked for it from a staff member who was busy chatting. Approximately 10 minutes later I finally get to order my drink, which takes another 15 minutes to come!  Something about having to change a keg.... Remember this is a BEER HALL which should be pretty up on how to change kegs when they are running low!! In the meantime the wait staff looks like they are all over the place without guidance or supervision. When the drinks arrive, the waitress notices the table is still dirty, but I had to ask her to clean it... This place is a blackhole of service, shame a great place went horribly wrong!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here, and I was pleasantly surprised. Distillery District is gorgeous, and this place was casual, but up-to-scale for Distillery. Think Biermarkt, but upscale, less rowdy, and more fusion food. 

We were a group of 12 that had made dinner reservations. Our table was available 20 minutes early which was great, since 3/4 of a party had arrived early. Everyone was impressed with the space. Clean, bold, rustic/industrial. 

Our servers were really patient with our \"chill/confusing\" ordering vibe. We started with drinks and since the order was taking a bit long, they gave us some samples! 

Food: I had the duck confit wings which were DELICIOUS. and the Elk burger which was GOOD, but hard to eat since it was stacked really high. I ended up having to pick out the pickle and eat it on the side. I also had the fish tacos which were good, but nothing special. I shared this with one other person. 

People around the table ordered beet salad, pizzas, sandwiches, and one person got the schnitzel. Good reviews for everything except the Margherita pizza which was not as saucy as my friend wanted. 

Drink: I heard good things about the beermosa and the long island ice tea. The design-your-own flights were a huge hit! The beerschnapps was gross - I order a round for the table and regret my decision, haha. 

All in all, a good experience. I took away one star because near the end of the night there was some smoke coming from the kitchen :("}
{"text":"I have dined here twice and both times was underwhelmed with the food. I liked the concept of the beer hall, just really felt like the items were overpriced for what you got.

The first time I went with my parents and one of my younger brothers. The atmosphere was fun, and the beer flights are great to try a selection of various beers.

We ordered fondue to share and duck wings. The fondue was tasty but you really didn't get too many dippable items with the cheese, by the end we had way more dip than pieces of food. I enjoyed the duck wings even though I am not a \"wing\" person (I know, that is blasphemous but I no care lol). I liked the crispiness of the wings and the sticky sauce was tasty.

My main was a seared pickerel (?) and was just meh.

In both visits, I must add our servers were perfectly polite but each time they disappeared close to the end of the meal as it seems this place is slightly understaffed at times.

I would say this place is better to drink at then enjoy food, for me anyway."}
{"text":"Not bad drinks, but nothing all that special. The inside is really neat and the service was okay. Location is great, but the prices are too high for what you get. I'm also torn on whether or not the music matches the feel of this establishment... I don't think I'll plan on coming back."}
{"text":"The ambience, staff, and food are all good. This is my go to place at Distillery District. 100th Meridian and Organic Lager is my go to beers from Mill st. brewery. The menu choice is extensive so have fun picking! Yay."}
{"text":"Dear Mill Street, there are MANY options and you should not be on anyone's top list. Not returning to this place again. Our company decided to have the end of summer party here. We were given a private area with our own cook. The service \"in particular the person managing our party\" was absolutely useless. The company ordered food for 50 people. I did a headcount while there because I was upset that they had ran out of food and we were only 43 people. They sliced the chicken breast into 4 pieces, ran out of ribs, ran out of mushrooms, forgot the potato salad and still gave us attitude! We had to wait for over 40 minutes to get more meats. They mad a crap load of money on us but they will NEVER get out business again. It was embarrassing for us as we had partners that were visiting from 4 other countries."}
{"text":"My cousin and I visited this place on a Friday night. 

Atmosphere:
It did not feel very cozy or private. It was relatively crowded. The place accommodates large groups and kids, so it gets very noisy at times. The music is not too loud, but with so many tables close-by, it is difficult to have a conversation.

Food:
Very average, would classify it as bar food. Beer selection is relatively good, and beer tasting is available. Loved that part very much!

Prices:
Average as well.

Overall impression:
A good place to get together with a bunch of buddies for a casual night out. Good beer."}
{"text":"Had no idea that Mill Street had an adjoining restaurant after our hostess advised us that they no longer were serving their Minimus beer at the brewery restaurant.  Hence we made our way to their restaurant, and thankfully the hostess there recommended their patio section.  Huge patio, and partially covered with heaters, the ambiance is KICKING all right! tons of people, drinks and food all around.  The atmosphere was nothing short of perfect.  Each of us were here just for drinks, I had their Lemon Tea Beer; smooth, light, and flavorful in a can of delightness.  The others had the Coffee Porter, Frambozen, and the Minimus.....no complaints at all!! will definitely be back for a second round, this time for food!"}
{"text":"I've only eaten there once, but I had the elk burger with fries. Both were very good, and completely hit the spot, but I expected something a little more for $19 
I'm not sure what else I was after - maybe more fries, or a nicer presentation? 
Anyway, it was good, and I'll go back again."}
{"text":"When in the Distillery there are a few options to eat, but then it's kinda stuck in one specific area and you gotta walk a couple blocks just to get more options. So you decide to just in there.

Mill Street Beer seems like a good option as it's packed, casual and why not a beer hall. One thing, the wait is too long. I think we waited at least 45 minutes, but I'm sure it's not always like this.

On walking in, I don't know why but the bar smelled a bit like vomit. The servers are very friendly and helpful, weird thing is they don't always have utensils and it comes very far away to get it. Because it's so popular and it's not so fast to fill the table people kinda wander in and sit at the empty table. This happened multiple times as I was at my table. As someone who might be still waiting I'd be pretty upset if I saw that. The servers were quite diplomatic and made people get up and move.

The food, smoked char salad is great! The jager chicken schnitzel, and make sure to get the jager as without it I found it a bit dry was quite nice as well.

The beer book has all their brews but they aren't all available. Then I talked to someone else afterwards and they said it was. Weird. Anyways, because of this inconsistency, that doesn't make it that great.

The available brews though, generally quite good but if you are familiar with Mill Street it's nothing to write home about. This is a casual restaurant with plenty of beer (albeit typically specific to their own). I just can't get over that smell of vomit. Maybe it's a one-time thing, maybe it's not. And the wait despite being so big is tough to deal with."}
{"text":"I just had the worst service of all time here.
I just needed acknowledgement from my server that I was looking to order. She gave me the dirtiest look possible and when she came around, in the worst attitude possible, \"sorry, I was talking to someone\", with the tone of \"you are f**king rude for trying to get my attention\" I am writing this while I'm in the restaurant at my table, instead of enjoy my food and company, I'm sitting here writing this in utter disgust."}
{"text":"Split a pretzel plate and had some beers here as we were out exploring Toronto and loved it. Their Vanilla Porter is epically good and their stout and wit are pretty good too. The pretzel had good flavor and came with some mustard cheese sauce with it. Great midday or lunch stop when you are out and about exploring on a weekend."}
{"text":"Not to be confused with the Mill Street pub/restaurant right next door. 

Pro:

Nice selection of beer. Spacious interior. 

Con:

Food is pricey and portions are small. It deviates from the standard pub fare. No burgers. No fish 'n' chips.

Pro:

Really tasty food. I had the flank steak and it was some of the best tasting stuff I've had in a while. 

Con:

Too bad the flank steak was $19 for a few slices of flank and a tiny bowl of potato chips.  Aren't we here swilling back beer? Does the food have to be so expensive?

Pro:

Great service."}
{"text":"The food here was great, 4/5. Service was another story, including that it took 45 minutes to get the bill, so 1/5 for service. Atmosphere I'd score a -2 out of 5. It's a noisy place and playing music over top of the noise only makes it worse. And if that doesn't bother you, there's always the member of staff hollering \"service\" every minute or two to startle you."}
{"text":"This place was alright. The beer was good, the food was okay, and the service wasn't bad. We can here for the beer but ended up trying the flatbread and fries as a snack. Both were good but nothing to write home about. I loved that you could get beer flights, that was one of the highlights. 

There were a couple of things that made out visit less than great. First of all, I can't speak for all of the patrons who visit the restaurant, but the table beside us was just plain rude to our waitress. I could not believe the audacity of these people. While she was taking our orders they interrupted her and started demanding things with no regard for the fact that she was currently taking care of us. 

Secondly, it was unbelievably loud. This is more an acoustics issue than the fact that there were a lot of people there or the music was loud. It must be the high ceilings or something. I guess it adds to the beer hall feel but we were there on a monday night and the restaurant was half empty and still I couldn't hear the person sitting beside me. Even in actual German beer halls in Munich I don't remember it ever being that bad. This made it kind of frustrating to eat and drink there, I can only imagine it would be worse on a weekend. 

I wont rush back to this place. Although the food we had was pretty tasty nothing was super memorable. The other things on the menu didn't seem all that exciting. I would come back to grab a drink and snack sometime but if it's a meal I'm looking for I'll probably try somewhere else. In a city of great restaurants this one kind of blends into the woodwork."}
{"text":"Note: This review may not be as relevant since I wasn't a paying customer

Our company had our summer event here in mid June. So different departments from our company can get together and socialize. 
My coworker and I got here early and enjoyed the seafood station and the cheese and meat platter, although we saw a few flies near the crab legs/mussels....
The oysters were fair and cheese and dried sausage were good. Their in house  lemon earl grey beer was pretty good since I like something light.

As for lunch we had two mains one is mini taco and one is Mac n cheese. We lined up and there's chefs that serve you to the tacos and Mac n cheese. We got to pick your ingredients.... The tacos was soso Cuz it's a bit dry and such a small ones that you can't wrap much inside.... But the Mac n cheese was good.... You can have different meats and sausages, asparagus, onions, etc. And he cooked in front of you... I had two bowls of it ;) 
Lastly there was a salad bar and desserts (donuts and icrecream sandwiches).

Overall the food was average, venue was quite nice.... It was a warm and sunny day....such nice weather to be out on a Friday afternoon and I won one of our company's prizes.... Couldn't ask for more...."}
{"text":"Pub food not to mention, amazing beer and good staff. Been here a few time and love it."}
{"text":"We ran an event for 30 people last night and for the most part, everything was great. If you are running an event, I suggest working with your food waiter on their instructions as to what comes out, in which order, when. For us, there was a mix up, but we made it work.

We organized a tour with the brew master and it was very informative. One note, don't send people in without filling them up on food first...and give them a drink. There are no samples offered and you can't buy beer on the tour. Thirty minutes without food or drink as you stand in front of a bazillion litres of beer is a bit much.

No private room but the staff cordoned off an area for us an it worked quite well.

Great wait staff, especially Ashley. And very sweet and hard working bar staff, especially Vera.

The food was delicious and fresh, especially the sliders. The Oktoberfest beer was my personal favourite...a bit malty and hoppy yet thirst quenching...notes of grapefruit and hazelnut."}
{"text":"On a cold, damp day, while visiting the Toronto Christmas Market, the flaming heaters on the patio seemed very inviting. We did, however, choose to sit inside. My guests, Floridians for most of their lives, were freezing!

We were greeted and seated promptly and a server soon showed up with complimentary beer samples. Nice! Can we have seconds? Thirds? No? Darn! It was a nice touch.

With dinner on our itinerary only four hours later, we chose to share a pizza and an order of perogies. Of course, we had to have a cocktail to warm up. The cocktails were good and the food was tasty but could have been served a little warmer.

Overall, it was a good experience with nice ambiance and good service."}
{"text":"Walk past the the Mill Street Brew Pub from the main street, into the Mill Street Store and you will find the Mill Street Beer Hall right across from the entrance. It is a deceptively large space, as it spans all the way to the back and there are plenty of long tables for patrons. It's cosy and inviting during the winter and there is plenty of patio space outside during the summer months.

We came on a Friday night after taking in the LightFest and immediately found a table even though the pub next door was full with a 30 min wait list. The beer menu is extensive and the servers are very helpful in choosing if you get overwhelmed. The smoked brisket burger was good, meat was tender and well seasoned. Fries were demolished also. 

Don't get stuck on the wait list for the pub, come here instead!"}

Trying the fon2 cheese plate and a fabulous beer (they have plenty) it has been an amazing starting.!! Even the rest has been over the average so this is deeply suggested.. The service is not so quickly but the staff it is very kind"}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday and tried the Summerlicious menu. It was the worst decision of life. 

Service:
They were so understaffed and our server looked very overwhelmed with our large party. She did an okay job given the number of people but didn't really bother to check in to see if everything was okay.

Food:
I got the salmon gravalax to start and tasted some of the pork belly appetizer. The salmon was good but the soba noodles it came with bland and not fresh. Don't get the pork belly. They turned it into a pate and it defeats the whole point of eating pork belly!!! The texture was like tuna too.

Next was the chicken schnitzel. The meat was cooked well but bland. The spatzle was super, super bland! You are literally eating boiled pieces of nutmeg-flavoured dough. The worst and most disappointing part of the meal. Have they never heard of frying it with butter to finish it off? The cabbage it came with was nothing special. 

Finally dessert came and I was pleasantly surprised that it was actually good. The brownie was a little dense but full of chocolate! 


Overall:
I wouldn't come back here. The food was sub-par and not worth it. Just come here for drinks and skip the food! If you do, expect the most boring meal of your life."}

{"text":"Came with a large party and ended up being seated in a servers section where they only had our party and another. Never came by to do a two bite check, waited for ketchup which eventually came after I was done our meal. Ended up asking to speak to a manager who was a lovely african american girl who took care of everything. But the point was the server just didn't care. The food was lack luster and his service was even worse. We still tipped him becuase we work in the industry, however he shouldn't have actually received anything. if the GM is reading this you can definitely contact me for more details but something definitely has to change there."}
{"text":"Some girlfriends and I wanted to check out the Mexican restaurant in the Distillery, but we couldn't get a reservation for Saturday night. As a result, we found ourselves at the Mill Street Beer Hall. I love Mill Street beer so I knew that we couldn't go wrong. On Saturday night, this place was packed! We were a group of seven so everyone found something of interest on the menu. Prior to our meal, we ordered a number of bottles of both red and white (pricing was quite reasonable). We also enjoyed a couple of appetizers (duck wings, giant pretzel, and frites). All were tasty. As the main, I had the chicken schnitzel; the portion was generous so even I could not finish it. If going out with a group of people, I would highly recommend the Beer Hall.

Good for: groups, going out, beer"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic!!  We were in Toronto over the American Thanksgiving break, and decided to stop here on that Saturday for a bite to eat.  There was some big Toronto Christmas Market going on, so to get there we passed a bunch of places that we could have eaten and stayed for a drink, but really wanted to try this place (no recommendations, it just sounded good in a write up I had read previously).  Well, the place was packed on a Saturday afternoon at 1pm.  We barely made it in the door and the people after us were turned away b/c the place was filled to capacity.  We immediately were seated, but it took some time for a waiter to come and take our drink order.  We realized it was pretty crowded and cold outside, so we were in no rush.  We had an excellent waiter, Alex, who was really on top of everything, despite the crowds of other people he was taking care of too.  We ordered, and then about 5 minutes later, wanted to change our order.  We hunted down the waiter and he said no problem.  There was a bit of a wait for our food, but we just chalked it up to the large crowd.  We saw another waitress bringing out the Bavarian pretzel appetizer to another table, and as she passed by, we joked that she could leave it on our table.  She laughed and about 10 minutes later, she DID bring us the app!!  It was fantastic.  Soon after that, we received our original canceled order of \"fun\" due.  Alex came back and said the kitchen made a mistake but our \"real\" order would be our shortly, so enjoy the fondue!  We ate practically all of it and then low and behold, our order comes out!  I couldn't eat another thing after all of that food....and to top it all off, the other waitress who we didn't know, stopped by to drop a huge basket of fries on the table!  This place didn't just have good food, it had great customer service too.  Even though we were there awhile, the ambiance and crowd didn't make it seem like we were just sitting and waiting to eat.  I would highly recommend this place for its food, wait staff and overall great vibe!!  Can't wait to return to Toronto and go again!"}
{"text":"Honestly the service was honest.  The food came incorrectly, not the correct drink and our bill was bad but the service was honest and kind. 
If we had gotten what we ordered I would have given a 4/5"}
{"text":"Came here last Thursday (during the Christmas Market). It was super busy and the staff were good. They were pleasant despite being under pressure. Didn't have any food, but I liked the vibe in this place. 

Will try it again for sure."}
{"text":"2.5 + 0.5 for awesome service

Came here for dinner while visiting the Christmas Market.  Come for the drinks and apps, stay away from the entrees if you can.  

Pros:
Plenty of seats
Service was awesome

Cons:
Food was meh at best
Food is pricey for what you get

This was the one place that didn't have a 2+ hour wait time for seats while we were at the Christmas market. Maybe we should of taken that as a sign.

The place has plenty of seats. It's always massively busy during the Christmas Market so plan accordingly if you come here during that time.  There is plenty of spacing though, which is a great thing if you have children. We came with 4 other families totaling 7 children and we were sat very well with plenty of room for the strollers as well.

When it comes to this place, I would recommend you stick with the drinks and the apps.  They were all pretty good and well done.  As for the entree food, I was less than impressed to say the least.  My GF ordered a flat bread and I had the Arctic Char entree.  The flat bread was passable at best but my char was very disappointing.  I got 2 little pieces about the size of a Doritos chip.  There were about 6 potato balls and some twigs pretending to be a salad.  There were some candied bacon bits and they were unfortunately the best part of the dish.  The knockout blow comes from the $26 price, ouch.  I could go to a HK Style cafe or Hakka restaurant and feed about 3 people for the same price.

This places saving grace is the service.  We had the most awesome waitress ever.  She was nice, funny, helpful and just and overall great person.  She really seemed like she loved being there and passed on the good vibes to everyone around.  She was an all around treat to deal with.  I didn't enjoy my meal at all, but she definitely softened the blow.

I totally recommend this place for drinks.  If you want dinner though, I would say only if you absolutely must."}
{"text":"I came here for Summerlicious. I was pleasantly surprised by the food! It felt like great value for my money. 

We ordered the pretzels and salad to start. I also had one of their house brewed root beers, which was not too sweet and not as overwhelming in flavour as grocery store root beer. There was nothing remarkable about the salad, but it was filled with leafy greens and they were very fresh. The pretzels and cheese dip were very delicious and tasted very authentic. The chicken ciabatta for the main was a bit on the dry side, though the flatbread was generous in serving, flavorful and hearty. I didn't personally try the beef sandwich but it looked pretty good. 

The dessert was a bit disappointing, but considering that the entire meal was $15, it was still acceptable. The tarts tasted plain,  with a buttery and crumbly outside. I wouldn't have enjoyed them very much on their own but it was nice to end the meal with something sweet. 

Overall the service was good, I thought that the setting was very nice and it wasn't too loud, and I definitely felt that I got my money's worth. I would probably return for the regular menu and also to try the beer!"}
{"text":"The four of us went for some beer and a meal, and we literally ended up walking out. The sub par food was completely cold, and one of our party didn't receive the fried chicken she ordered at all. The appetizers came WITH the meals, not before after 45 minutes of waiting. Anyways. We left. I wouldn't recommend this place. The beer is always good at Mill Street however. Thus earning one star from me"}
{"text":"best sharing restaurant in Toronto their wings are to die for so are their fish tacos. overall a good atmosphere and great experience. My favourite thing on the menu is their mushroom flatbread."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant in the town, Vanessa Stanley the manager is the best manager I've ever seen; she's very helpful.  We were a group of families, the restaurant was packed in the weekend and she helped us to get the dinner and drink on time. The food and service are excellent. Highly recommended to couples and families"}
{"text":"Wow!! The food is amazing here. We all shared a variety of dishes and one was better than the next. The duck wings, mushroom flat bread, \"fun\"due and steak were great. Did I mention the great selection of fabulous beers? You must check it out. The town is super cute..an added bonus."}
{"text":"The beer gets at least four stars however the outdoor bar was so dirty and smelly from hours of spilled beverages sitting on the bar without any cleaning, we could not stay beyond one drink. We were there at 2 in the afternoon so it hadn't been open long enough to get as filthy as it was just that day. Had it been clean, we may have stayed for two or three and maybe a bite to eat. The bartenders were friendly and eccentric but couldn't make up for the lack of hygiene."}
{"text":"We had a late lunch at the Mill Street Beer Hall in the Distillery District.  It was a busy spot so it's a good thing we had a reservation!

Because the Toronto Christmas Market is going on, the restaurant is currently providing a reduced menu.  I ordered Fried Chicken Forestiere (without the wild mushroom sauce).  It was just okay.  The two pieces of chicken were boneless and a bit on the small side.  The chicken was tender but the outside was overcooked."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere but the staff kind da think they are too relax, Not satisfy a service and food a little all over the place. It need to find more standout point. I order Cesar salad and it a little over price $10 for just a cheap romance lettuces. My husband order Nacho come with little sauce and lot of chips.....  little wired ."}
{"text":"Mill Street Beer Hall is attached to the Brew Pub. Not really sure why they decide to separate into two different restaurants, but according to the website both places have different food menus. For this review I would be writing about the Beer Hall.

The Beer Hall has a nice big patio,great for enjoying their nano-brewed beers. I was told that they recently revamped their food menu, and I thought the food was quite decent.

The BBQ platter for 4 was excellent - with biscuits, sausages, ribs, beef brisket and beer-brined fries. If you were to choose only one thing from their menu, this would be on top of my list.

The roasted cauliflower was great, as was the standalone brisket and elk burger. There is a vegetarian flatbread as well if you don't feel like having meat.

Considering the location and the heavy presence of mid-high end restaurants inside the Distillery District, I think this is a great place for some casual eats and brews without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"The beer is really good- if you like hoppy, try the stargazer. The food is a bit pricey but good (not great). The location is picturesque and nostalgically lovely and the building is really cool.

But damn, is the service bad. Apathetic and understaffed. When we first got there, we waited 20 minutes before a server came and took our order. After moving out to the patio (which was pretty quick considering it was a weekend) we waited an additional 30 minutes before we got frustrated enough to take matters into our own hands and flagged down a wayward server. The food took a while and the fondue arrived cold. If you've got time and patience, it's a cool place to hang out. If you're on a schedule, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The food here is way better than the brew pub. They have a great atmosphere. The patio is nice and has heat lamps for the colder times. It's in a nice part of the distillery district. 

I ordered a chicken salad sandwich and it was delicious. it came with a kale salad. The kale salad which was also delicious and had blue cheese, green apple and pomegranate seeds. 

The service was nice, the food was delicious and they have free wifi. Daytime, not busy at all... I definitely want to go back!"}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in to the Mill Street Beer Hall, I loved it! The venue is exactly the sort I love - old mixed with new, lots of bench seating and shared tables, what's not to love! They have even made narrow table tops work by doubling up on them - there is a shelf to put your drinks while you enjoy your food! 

Being a nice night, we decided to sit on their large covered patio which has tons of seating. The great thing about the patio is that it looks exposed, but if you look closely, on top of the wooden slatted awning is glass which would keep you dry in the rain! There are also lots of heaters installed, and while we didn't need them that night, I think they would make the patio comfortable even in the fall. 

So why the three star review?

The main reason is the service! It could have been an off night, but I wasn't impressed at all. We were told there would be a 10 minute wait for a table which seemed reasonable, and after waiting only about 5 minutes we were seated in a large lounge area, easily two times as big as necessary for a party of four. The server took our orders but then really rushed us out, constantly asking how we were doing and then taking glasses away (we had ordered a few flights) the minute we put them down. She brought us the bill about two second after we had finished the last drink. 

Now I know that a place like that is busy, but why not just wait and seat us somewhere appropriate and let us enjoy our drinks? It just seemed unnecessary and really rushed, which left me feeling negatively about the place. 

So, would I go and give it another shot? Probably, but next time I'm going to make sure I'm with enough people to fill my seating area, or I'm waiting for a smaller table!"}
{"text":"Awesome custom hot sauce by Richard. You got to ask for Richard. Unique root beer. Kids friendly!"}
{"text":"Service was mediocre.  Not that our waitress was bad,  she had way to much ground to cover.  Beer was fine.  Jerk chicken and brisket sandwiches were flavorful.  Music was way too loud- our waitress mentioned it to us,  but nothing changed.  Ok experience."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The waitress delivered our food to the wrong table and the food was touched by another person before she realized the mistake and simply served the same food to us as if nothing had happened. We basically received someone else's leftover. The place was not even full."}
{"text":"Been here twice on my visit, they have a nice selection of beers on taps with nice seasonal options too. The servers are knowledgeable about the product, so if you feel overwhelmed about the choices and all the different names you see don't worry they will help and they have a lot of patience as I am sure everyone always asks. 

Only had the large pretzel which was a bit too salty for my taste but edible none the less. The environment is nice whether you are inside or out. 

Knocking off a star because the second time I went with my friends our bartender did not give us the great service. He started off nice but as soon as I said we were going to share a flight, he just turned off. I asked about the seasonal beers so he could explain it to my friends, but he just pointed to a chalk board and said its there which just had the names of beers and no description, a super high contrast compared to the service I got from both a waitress and another bartender my previous visit. 

It was a bit of a turn off and will have me trying other places in the area during my next visit, although would consider going back as I hope this is an isolated incident."}
{"text":"Visited the distillery district and ended up here. Really great food, like Korean BBQ duck wings and poutine. Had a beer flight with a nice selection like a rye beer, vanilla stout and Rauchbier (smoked). Staff was very friendly, would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"18 of us met for brunch one sunday.

The good (for us):
- They were able to seat 18 people without reservations on the patio
- The patio is very nice
- They had nice live music
- They were willing to do separate bills

The meh:
- Food - nothing looked too exciting, and for a pub, it really doesn't have any appetizers to share. Forget the regulars, it really had NOTHING to share except some boring looking pretzel (which a few people ordered and didn't finish)
- I ordered the potato and ricotta dumplings with mushroom ragout. What I got was gnocchi sumberged in a too-rich creamy alfredo sauce that made me feel sick after eating half - even though it was a tiny portion. That's how heavy and greasy it was.
- We ordered what we thought was the \"beef carpaccio\" to start. Turns out this wannabe fancy place menu said \"beet\" and not \"beef\" so my hubby and I were stuck with something we didn't want to eat (it was too bland). Our fault for not noticing the last letter and being more careful about the description, but even on its own the dish was not good.

The terrible:
- We were wondering what we could share to start and asked the waitress what would be good (since it seemed all salads) and she said \"this place is too upmarket for that\". Lol. This is a really wannabe fancy place and not a true blue high-end, good-food place!
- The waitress confused the dishes on a few people's bills. Not trained enough.

Would I go back - not unless I just want to sit and drink a beer on a nice patio around the distillery. Nothing else."}
{"text":"My friends and I were visiting Toronto from Miami, and we received multiple recommendations from locals to try Mill Street. We ended up staying HOURS, and we loved it. We had some trouble telling where the brewery, beer pub, and beer hall end, so I apologize if I'm confusing places in my description!

We started out getting a table for dinner, but when the server informed us that the last brewery tour was set to start in 15 minutes, we got our nachos to go and ran into the tour! The tour was really interesting -- if you've ever done a tour at a large brewery like Budweiser, you may find it really impressive how a small brewery does the process. We learned all about it, from Maggie, who said it was her last day. So sad --- she was amazing! 

Then we were ushered into the Beer Hall for our flights, included in the $10 for the tour! We got 4 small-but-not-that-small glasses of different beers, which were each explained one at a time. My personal favorite was the ginger one, but they were all great. We also purchased an IPA after that Maggie had recommended that had something like 3-4 times the usual amount of hops! It was tasty and not as bitter as I expected. We had a different server at our next table, who we occasionally had to flag down. Food-wise, we got the duck wings (so saucy and delicious) and a watermelon salad (very refreshing!). 

Afterward, we wandered back into the gift shop, where we inquired about the pint glass that the menu states comes with the tour. Maggie told us that that wasn't correct, so we purchased some souvenirs in the store. I thought things were really nicely priced. I got a Mill Street tee for my husband, and a tank that was on sale for $6 for me! We also bought a Seasonal Sampler 6-pack to go.

Overall, we had a great time. I would recommend the tour!!"}
{"text":"I decided to come here for my going away party and I'm glad this was the place. I made a reservation and the table was ready when we arrived. There seemed to be a bit of a hurried pace going around which we later found out was because they were doing their grand opening the next day and they were working on the final touches.

To start I went with a flight of beers. I like getting a flight as there are many Mill Street offerings you don't see at the average bar outside of their core stable of beers. The table ordered a range of food but many went with the pizza. I decided to try out the curry mussels. They were excellent. The curry flavour was perfect with a good amount of heat and the seafood was well prepared.

Through the night we also tried the beer shots. These were like nothing I've ever tried before and some were certainly better than others. I'll need to try a few of these again on a future visit."}
{"text":"Beer and Patio on a nice summer evening!

I did not order any food, which I usually never eat at breweries and pubs. 

I might not be the #1 fan of Mills Street's products but it is good to see how a local brewery is getting so successful. There are quite a few beer seasonal on tap and even try their bierschnaps at  45% abv.

Since I was sitting at the bar on the patio, I received fast and friendly service from the bartender.

I definitely will be back for some more beer drinking on the patio when I am in the Distillery District. ."}
{"text":"What a wonderful restaurant right in the heart of the distillery district! The atmosphere and staff are very welcoming and inviting. This is definitely a great place to stop by for a full meal or to hang out and try a variety of Canadian craft beer. 

I had the pretzel and a flight of beer. I definitely recommend getting the flight for the value and the experience of getting to try multiple styles. 

The pretzel was pretty good a little harder than I prefer but had good flavor and the cheese made it 4 Stars instead of 3 it was so good. 

The beer also gets 4 stars because they all had good flavor but they were quite mild and a bit similar still very happy with the choices just could have used a bit more diversity in the flavor profiles of each beer. 

The service was excellent quick and friendly and gave recommendations. Definitely attentive and 5 stars for service."}
{"text":"I guess I come here because it seems like the easiest place to come for a quick beer and some food if I'm in the distillery District.  Been here 5 times now.  The food is fine at best.  The beer is also fine.  The service is sooo slow!  Understaffed?  Even at the bar it's difficult to get attention.  What gives?"}
{"text":"Was difficult locating entrance as it is only steps away from Mill Street tasting room and bar. 

Has way more seating avail with free samples offered of their latest seasonal tap. 

Server was prompt, friendly, and efficient. 

Was not pleased with dipping sauces for pretzel since the cheese tasted like butter with parmesan on it, and dijon mustard was a bit salty. 

Beet salad was nicely presented and flavorful. Pours are decent and beers samples were good. Overall ok."}
{"text":"The patio has a great ambiance to it and there's a decent beer list and those are really the best aspects of Mill Street. 

They have a huge beer list, but only about 1/3 of the beer on the list is on tap and when you order one they make a recommendation of another beer that wasn't even on the list in the first place - maybe they should update their menu?

I also felt that the service was pretty subpar. When we put our name in with the host she said she would check for a table for us. 10 minutes later and we're still waiting but two other walk-up groups, as large as ours, have been seated. She then looked at us again and asked if we had spoken to someone. To which we replayed, yes you, and she looked baffled.

Also the drinks for two of our group didn't show up and we had to remind the wait staff several times that they never got their drinks - maybe hire more people if your staff is over worked?

With the exception of the poutine trio none of the group through the food was very good. Honestly the poutine trio is the reason I bumped the review up from 2 to 3 stars.

My advise, come for some beers and the patio, order the poutine and leave it at that."}
{"text":"Mill Street Beer Hall (@MillStBrewPubTO) is just around the corner from the original Brew Pub in the Distillery District with more than 500 seats which included a very big patio space.

 Definitely love the more updated and modern space compare to the original Brew Pub which I have always thought outdated. Love all the copper beer lines around the ceiling and long wooden tables which further accentuate the industrial feel of the space.

Love the open kitchen but with all the heating light by the counter, it was incredible hot if seated near that area and with the big doors opening the patio means not much AC.
With the long tables and huge space, it's perfect for larger party.

 We only tried 2 things from the menu since we ate before meeting up with some friends, so I am hoping to go back soon and do a 2nd post.

 Mill Street Sampler
~ Hell Bock, Paradise IPA, Distillery Ale, Frambozen
~ Both of us are already very familiar with their regular brew, so we decided to try some of their special brew from 

And of course we had to try the bierschapps which is a rare find outside of Germany and the only place available in Toronto. I have to say I'm not a big fan of this distilled spirit.

 Pork Board $29
~ hose made bratwurst, smoked pork belly, apple glazed Frenched pork shank, turnip choucroute, horseradish mustard, candied apples, pretzel twit
~ The prok belly was melt in your mouth good and  the sausage was perfect with the mustard, even the pretzel was so good cover with butter. 
~ The only thing we didn't like was the pork shank which was very dry and overcooked.

We share another pint of Distillery Ale and a half pint of the Helles Bock which was my favorite from the flight we tried. Love the sweet malty flavor with hint of currants w/ a tiny bit of hop-y bitterness.

~  I wouldn't say it was wow but it was made fresh, served hot and was very light... def did it's job a satisfying my hot dessert cravings.

 Verdict :
~ There's no doubt they have great beer but the food was great too.
~ Can't wait to go back and try more of their food items."}
{"text":"the charchiterie for two was pathetic.   more mustard on plate than cheese.   the tiny slice of brie was hard on edges.   i did like the olives.   low on staff and poor waitress was swamped so had to wait over five min to be greeted/drink order.     AND they were out of pinot grigio!!!?"}
{"text":"Although extremely busy (esp during The Christmas Market), service was fast and friendly but my complaint is with the food. Tried to order schnitzel since it's the Wednesday special but by 8:30pm they had ran out. Ordered the perogies and wild boar bratwurst between 2 people; and the portions were SO SMALL. For being $14 each, I was hoping it would at least be a substantial amount that people weren't still extremely hungry afterwards. I won't come back to eat here, unless they up their portion sizes. 5 stars for the Weizenbock though!"}
{"text":"Distillery district is what hipster dreams are made of and to make it even better, it had the mill street beer hall!

The packed restaurant sat our group of three adults and a child immediately. There was pups everywhere, I was in heaven.

Canadas drinking age is 18/19 but the guy still hesitated when he checked my ID. Trust me, I look 16 but I'm 22, I promise... 

It took a while for my beer and my sisters wine to come out but once it did it paired deliciously with our app pretzel. I ordered the Belgium wheat and my brother ordered the IPA. The IPA blew my beer away. 

What stole the show was the food! So amazing. The steak frites was a bit over cooked but I didn't complain cause it was amazing. 

The fish and chips was perfectly battered and crisp and the chicken pot pie was out of this world. I would recommend all of it tbh. 

Loved it and I'll be back to try other beers!!"}
{"text":"If you want to drink beer, this is a great place... Cocktails, not so much. Service is good, they will give you samples of beer as well. We had the cheese board, which was really good."}
{"text":"I love the Distillery, great atmosphere! Many new places have popped up, it is not a crowded as it was before. A lot of foodie tourists, a lot of locals and art lovers, always a good mix of people. 
The Beer Hall blends good with the older establishments. We popped in only for a beer, ordered the fries for a snack, there wasn't anything really enticing on the summerlicious menu. The service was great, their wifi is weak, the waiter is doing a weird dance with the cardreader to get the wifi. Tankhouse beer is great, the fries were amazing. I am going back to try some of the recommended dishes. 
Great place."}
