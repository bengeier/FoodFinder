{"text":"I LOVE this place me and my friends when last night and the people were SOO kind very thankful anytime you said thank you they would reply with your welcome. The service was beyond amazing. The food was mouth watering, absolutely delicious and the actual sushi was huge. Usually when you go to sushi places there's more rice than the centre filling but at this restaurant there is more filling than rice which is delicious! They do get one start off because the service was extremely extremely slow. It took about 45 minutes to get our first round of food and it didn't help that we were starving. Also for our second round it took the same amount of time. It was a full house but they needed more staff for the amount of people that were there. Also they do have seating but it's not a big restaurant so it gets kind of crowded. Overall absolutely delicious and great restaurant."}
{"text":"When Yelp will give us 0 stars?  Because 1 it's to much for this place.  It was my first and last time there.  Simply disgusting food!  Don't waste your time and money."}
{"text":"First time at Tekka Sushi, was very happy with the food, service and the environment. The Golden Menu has the best selection of sushi and it includes sashimi. Food came fast, fresh and with very good presentation. I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I had a really horrible experience here. Having come here twice for pick up and twice for AYCE. I always had horrendous service. Both pick up orders I had waited 30 minutes greater than the expected pick up time, and one of the pick ups was missing 2 orders of maki's. The first time I ate all you can eat there they said last call was 9:45 pm so I came in at 9:30 pm the next time and the waitress told me it was last call. So I didn't try to argue as there are other ones still open, but I did want to speak to the manager to let them know of the inconsistent information. Not to mention the two waitresses that served me both times were extremely rude. The waitress said the manager was on the phone so it'll be a few minutes. 10 minutes passes by and I asked where he was, she then said he went to throw the garbage.. I was shocked, I felt so disrespected that throwing garbage was more important than a customer sitting waiting to speak to a manager. Before this I was not mad I was patient and waiting but that just did it for me. Another 10 minutes passes by and he was still throwing garbage. I just left my number and asked the owner to call me. The owner did call back the next day and tried to apologize but no apology would make up for the experiences I've been through and how disrespected I felt."}
{"text":"I used to work at Fairview Mall for 3 years and frequently ate at Tekka Sushi. This place is in a small plaza in a neighbourhood across from Fairview Mall. My favorite here is the Sun Roll. I also really like the sushi pizzas which is surprising considering I never liked it before due to bad experience from other restaurants. The owner and staff are very friendly. I still eat here with my friends despite the distance because it's hands down my favorite sushi restaurant in the GTA. Ps. If you come here Mon-Thurs it's $14.99 AYCE silver menu all day. Highly recommend! :)"}
{"text":"Surprisingly great food for next to nothing. I was expecting the silver menu to be much more restrictive than the gold one but the only thing that's not on it is sashimi. The fish tastes fresh and service was great. The place is well designed. 

Only thing I would recommend to the owner is to have the staff clean the windows and the front glass door. 

Overall great experience, will be back."}
{"text":"I honestly am surprised at the negative reviews for this place.  I used to live just up the street from Tekka, and was a regular customer.  Now I only have it once in a while - last night through the magic of delivery.  The service has never been anything but prompt and courteous, and the food is always fresh and delicious! I love the spicy salmon rolls, and I dream of the Japan Sun Rolls.  The prices are also very reasonable.  As for AYCE, the two menus are both good values.  I'm definitely a fan of this little place :)"}
{"text":"I've personally gone twice with my roommate at 7pm on Friday and both times they have forgotten our main dishes which we asked for 4 times."}
{"text":"This is hands down our favorite sushi restaurant right now. For the longest time we only ordered in from this restaurant through just-eat. It was the best delivery sushi we had ever had! It tasted delicious and fresh like we were eating it in the restaurant! We never realized how close it was to where we lived until we happened across it one day while running errands. We decided we should definitely try eating at the restaurant as well.

     We went on a Saturday evening and it was busy but there was no wait time. We always get the Japan Sun rolls they are our favorite and once again it did not dissapoint. We also got tempura which was delicious. My husband had california rolls which were also very good. The menu is all you can eat and you can pick from one of two menus which determines how much you pay per person. I believe it ranges between 14.99 and 18.99 depending on whether it is lunch or dinner and which day of the week it is but don't quote me on that. I love their spicy salmon rolls also. It really comes down to we haven't ordered anything we didn't like from this restaurant (sweet potato rolls are also delicious!) 

   I like the way they've set up their interior as well. Two sides of the restaurant is windows so it gets plenty of light. The servers are friendly and efficient and we had no issues with the service we received. Considering how much you can spend when you go out for sushi we find them very reasonably priced and will continue to frequent this place both in house and ordering for delivery."}
{"text":"Order Sashimi and Sushi only.

Anything else is horrible. I ordered dumplings they were stale and cold. I order katsu don the pork tasted old and expired. I ordered chicken wings and they literally had no taste, battered wings with no salt or pepper or seasoning- disgusting! I ordered beef cubes and they were doused in teriaki sauce and tasted like they were 2 weeks old. Most the food was lukewarm to cold.

The next day we both had stomach aches.

All the seafood is decent. So if by the unregretable choice you find yourself here order the sashimi and makis nothing else."}
{"text":"Easily one of the worst AYCE sushi restaurants i have been to in my 3 years in Toronto. I ordered off of the gold menu which includes sashimi and all the other various rolls. Many of the rolls were borderline disgusting. The crispy bits that they put in some rolls at sushi restaurants, here they use what is essentially the same fried stuff as you would see in a mcdonalds chicken sandwich. The lemon chicken was a deep fried chicken burger topped with a drizzle of some mystery lemon sauce. I ordered the beef skewers as well and i can guarantee you that it was not beef. Everything had a funny taste to it and all the rolls we ordered came out sloppy. Maybe the guy making the rolls was overworked? Service was good but overall I go out for sushi for sushi and this place just did not deliver."}
{"text":"My go-to sushi place. Not out of preference, but pure proximity to my house. 

Decent sushi
Somewhat pricey
Sashimi cut on the thin side
Freshness of fish is good

Will definitely order from them again, but due to the portion sizes and prices, will probably stop for all you can eat next time."}
{"text":"I went for the AYCE on Tuesday. They have 2 separate AYCE menus one for 14.99 and the other for 19.99. I took the 14.99 one. Its a nice restaurant and the food is quite good, seems to be run by a family. 

What I disliked was that there was no sushi on the 14.99 menu, just Maki Rolls, and no miso soup on it either. Other AYCE sushi restaurants will give you proper sushi and Miso Soup, for an even lower price (11.99 on most places for weekday lunch hours)."}
{"text":"Four stars! For the great FRESH tasting salmon sashimi & surf clams. 

We ordered so many that they came on a boat. Their service was excellent, the staff were patient and friendly. They even replaced a plate for us when we saw overly grilled ribs. 

The deep fried tempura stuff were just average. But the sashmi, mmm. We got lucky that even part of our salmon sashimi were salmon belly. They were uber fatty and just heavenly. 

For all you can eat, this restaurant is great because unlike other all you can eats they forget your order (on purpose? lol). This place gave us EVERYTHING we asked for, even the 50 pieces of salmon sashimi & 40 pieces of surf clam lol. It was worth the money."}
{"text":"J'ai trouvé ça \"ben ordinaire\"! Délai du service très long! Sushis servies plat par plat. Sushis mal roules, bref je fais mieux! Je ne recommande pas cet endroit! Il doit y avoir mieux dans cette région."}
{"text":"As with most AYCE places, dishes are hit and miss. Stick to the fish selections, they are better than the meats. 

Overall, ok. Service was attentive."}
{"text":"Fun and friendly staff. Sushi was really good quality. This is definitely my new go to AYCE sushi place!"}
{"text":"Dans mon top des restaurants de sushis! Situé dans le centre-ville de Joliette, ce restaurant offre un délicieux choix de sushis frais absolument délicieux. Par contre, si vous êtes pressés par le temps, ce n'est pas l'endroit que je vous recommande. Le propriétaire est très sympathique et les employés aussi! Passez faire un tour!"}
{"text":"Went to this place because it was cheaper than other all you can eat sushi places around me. They have two menus, premium menu and the cheaper one, we got the cheaper one and the food was really good. Obviously it wasn't the highest quality but it was good for what it was. Also the servers are very nice and the food comes fast. Overall really good, definitely going back."}
{"text":"Meh. This sushi joint was almost hard to find, as the area would only be familiar with people living in that area/in the condos and apartments complexes. I came here with a rather large group, and we all agreed it wasn't that good. Service was lacking, as the servers kept missing some of our items, and they weren't as attentive to us (maybe because we were such a large table...but still!). Menu item selection was lacking as well. Things I could find at Matsuda or Ten-ichi wasn't even offered at Tekka! That disappointed me the most. I don't remember how much the total cost of the bill was, so I can't say anything about that. I think it was only slightly cheaper than Matsuda by a few dollars. Lastly, taste-wise, the sushi, sashimi, rolls and beef steaks were decent at best. Didn't taste like Matsudas, but it wasn't that terrible. I just didn't find anything worth hyping about. I don't think I would come back here, this place just lacks in selection and flavour."}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time yesterday at 734pm and the food only came at 830pm. So that was the first thing that irritated me. Friend and I ordered beef fried rice, chicken teriyaki, beef, chicken and avocado with spinach sushi. 

Because the food came late it wasn't warm anymore to start. The chicken teriyaki came only with A LOT of been sprouts no other vegetables as it claims to come with along with miso soup which was just ok and even the rice wasnt great.

On to the sushi: the chicken and beef sushi was absolutely the worst Ive ever tasted. It tasted old and almost as if was heated from being frozen. There was no effort put into this food. 

I will never order from here again and my opinion is order at your own risk"}
{"text":"The food is like any other all you can east sushi place it's clean and small, the waiter is very rude and blunt he sneezed into his hand 3 times right on the floor !! He brought our food and not even once asked if everything was ok , and didn't even bring everything we ordered ! And when we asked to order dessert he was giving us attitude on how we ordered and it took them like 10 min to bring the ice cream ! He was just standing in front of the sushi chef table . There is absolutely no customer service quality here if you are looking to come to a restaurant and pay to get annoyed defiantly try here !!"}
{"text":"I'm addicted to AYCE sushi places, so this review is coming from someone who has been to some of the better ones within the area.  Living so close to Tekka, I really hoped this would be good enough that I could just walk to if I ever needed to satisfy a craving, unfortunately this is not the place.

I should start by saying I've been to this location twice, both experiences were the same.  The overall food is well below average when compared to some of the other places like Matsuda or Tenichi.  I judge an AYCE place by the quality of their sashimi.  Their sashimi did not taste fresh, tuna seemed light yellow in colour and the salmon did not have an oily complexion or buttery taste.  I should never leave a place wondering if I'm going to get tape worms...

The tempura items were ok, nothing else on the menu particularly stood out.  The rolls were average at best.  I can at least say that the service was good, food came quick and we never had to wait to give the waiter our menu selections."}
{"text":"I was not at all disappointed, despite the questionable location, and interesting low-brow clientèle on the day I was there, but neither was I blown away.
I chose the gold menu, which includes the sashimi and some additional premium items, and it all was passable, if just a notch below competitors like Yoshiko and Matsuda, etc.for the same price.
Sashimi was uneven and just OK, no issues, just not notable either.
Standout items were the handrolls and dynamite roll, etc. which were well balanced with very fresh, crisp nori wrappings."}
{"text":"Save yourself from the disappointment and go for food court sushi in Fairview Mall. It's immediately obvious that the sashimi and sushi are not fresh or the best quality; in fact, the white fish must've been previously frozen judging by the spongey texture. The portion sizes are generous, but quantity doesn't make up for quality. My mom ordered the seafood udon soup which had very little taste and the \"seafood\" was minimal and most probably came out of a freezer bag. The smoke salmon sushi roll smelled fishy the moment it arrived; in fact, after being seated at the table I kept getting a wift of sourness for which I couldn't pin point the source. Going to the bathroom was a harrowing experience, walking down a dingy stairwell on grubby floor past the kitchen which one can't help but stare into as you pass it's flimsy mesh door. The bathroom looked like it belonged at a dive bar, not a place where I'm being served food at. Will never go back again!"}
{"text":"Ok so the sushi here is amazingly good. Honestly it's really delicious. But the waiters ignore you unless you wave them down (it wasn't busy when we showed up around 5pm on a Sunday). That being said, waiters are friendly and don't pester you too much, so it's a win/lose situation. I don't recommend getting anything fried as the oil tasted old. We ordered the miso
Soup which tasted too watered down. The avocado salad, which had one small piece of avocado, and the rest was iceberg lettuce. Deep fried oysters- the oysters tasted old and too fishy. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. We got the butter mushroom, but these also tasted old. The deep fried squid came as two pieces, super cold and rubbery. The onion rings tasted like they were store bought and fried in advance. The steak teriyaki was tough and dry! AVOID. The steak cubes were so delicious. The beef on skewered were so good. The Korean kalbi is average but good for here. The grilled eggplant was really good, actually fairly well done. The broccoli tempura was alright. The salmon belly was dry but good. The maki and sushi were delicious. I recommend the sun   Roll. The beef teriyaki udon was so gross. Unless you like oil for sauce. It was flavourless and really unappetizing. Whether you go for the silver or gold menu you have to pay for pop.  Overall this place was alright, but for 22$ go somewhere else. Also kids under 2 pay 3 bucks instead of free like most places. (We went for gold...) I don't think I'm ever coming back here. Well maybe for the sun roll. That was really good."}
{"text":"We used to order pretty often from Tekka.  But their quality has fallen off as of late.  Fish doesnt taste as fresh and bland rolls."}
{"text":"Men's washroom - really needs to be taken a looked at by the ministry of health. Everything here is mediocre. Tea wasn't hot. Sushi was terrible."}
{"text":"First time here! I was craving for Japanese food, but had no idea where to go. Driving around aimlessly for 20 minutes and I got extremely hungry. I remembered my friend had recommended this sushi restaurant not long ago, so I decided to give it a try. 

After 10 minutes of deciding what to order, I ended up ordering the Assorted Sushi Set Lunch. And the apps (Miso soup and Seaweed Salad) came in less than 10 seconds! Bomb! Next! The hot, crispy shrimp tempura and yam tempura came within 2 minutes (thank goodness!) And the rest of the food came which included the sushi rolls and bean sprout stir fry. They didn't have a website, so I decided to take a picture of every menu they owned! :P 

Everything tasted really good and the service is wonderfully friendly, I'll be sure to come back here soon.

P.S. leave a good tip whenever you're at a restaurant, especially if you enjoyed your experience! Servers make below minimum wage."}
{"text":"Very cheap the quality of the fish is not the greatest I guess you get what you pay for. The vegetarian dishes much better"}
{"text":"This was somewhere between a 2.5 and a 3. I made a reservation for 10 and they told me I could have 10% off if I paid cash. That I did. It came out to just over $20/person after tax and tip (10% included). We got seated in their back room, where two other parties already were. Although a few members of my party had arrived before I did, there were no cups on our table and there was no tea. It took them 10-15 minutes to bring us our tea and cups...after I asked twice. The second time I asked, they said they were bringing it, but that they were busy, and that it would take time. I had to get our soy sauce and wasabi. 

I asked that our table be treated like two separate tables, only seated together, in order that we could make sure that everyone got exactly what they wanted. Our main server said that was doable. Unless they were bringing food to us, the servers were never in the back room. We had to go out and fetch them. The first time this happened, I tried to give my order to a server who wasn't our main server, and she was very confused. Our main server told us that to avoid confusion because of our special ordering system, we should only give our orders to him. That was fine with me. The issue that arose after was that there were a few orders that were brought to us (not by him) that were given to the wrong side of the table. I guess that giving the orders only to him didn't completely eliminate the confusion he tried to eliminate.

An awkward thing was how they sometimes placed our orders onto the table. Our group ordered a large number of rolls, and they all came on one plate. No issues there. The waitress had to serve it with both hands. No issues there. She didn't say excuse me and tried to serve it over my head. What I mean is that she was directly over me and placed her hands above my head and lowered down the plate, bumping into my head in the process. Um...yeah. Not cool.

Food:
Mostly standard. Steak rolls with mushrooms stood out as a highlight. Lots of enoki mushroom. Tender enough for me to chew on even though I don't have use of my molars right now. Mackarel was bone-in, and served whole. Bitter towards the gut area. Lemon chicken nuggets looked like frozen chicken nuggets with a tiny bit of sauce. Steak (cubes and terriyaki) were tough (not just for me, but for my group). Seafood udon had next to no seafood (we found half a shrimp?). Tempura was standard, but in a good way. Rolls were decent. Silver menu has no sashimi or nigiri on it. Also no beef short ribs. Most things came in the amounts requested. 


One big food issue we faced was that one member of my group ordered chicken pan fried udon. After we had received everything from our first order, it still hadn't come, so we asked after it. We were told that it was a main dish, and that they served grilled items and rolls before they served mains, and that it was coming. Um...since when was there an enforced system as to what I can eat at any given time during AYCE? If I order my dessert at the beginning, are you going to give it to me at the end? After round 2, it still hadn't come. We ended up asking after it about 4 times. Finally, it came. It was the last item to come, and it came right before dessert. We ordered 1. They gave us 1...on a really big plate. I'VE SEEN ENTREE SIZED PAN FRIED UDONS SMALLER THAN THIS. Yes, I know we're a group of 10, but we specifically marked down a quantity of 1 for a reason. What a waste. The person who ordered it was technically not even a teenager yet. Female. She didn't eat very much of it. Where is the rest? Garbage. Sigh.

We had a bit of a dessert mix-up, where one of my dining companions got vanilla instead of mango ice cream, but it wasn't the end of the world. 

Final remarks:
Not a bad place for a cheap ayce, but don't expect the service to be fantastic. Should I come again, I'll ask not to be put in the back room, and ideally, with a smaller group, so we can sit at a booth."}
{"text":"This sushi bar is right across from Fairview mall.  I came across this restaurant when they had a groupon event and decided to try it out.  I do not believe this place is opened by Japanese, but their sushi and sashimi were actually not bad.  In fact, I was quite surprised with the negative reviews so far as I don't think this place is as bad as others have indicated.

This sushi bar has a lot of fusion sushi rolls, guess it is to accommodate the western population that are living in the area.  Their Eel with Cream Cheese actually surprised me and I enjoyed the combination.

The Tuna Tataki (Sashimi) was well done as well.  Nicely seasoned and the outside layer was burnt to perfection to give you the rough edge texture, but at the same time, able to retain the freshness of the tuna on the inside."}
{"text":"They had good food and good service too  But the hygiene level around you looks a bit questionable. Definitely one must atleast try this place once."}
{"text":"Would actually be a 3.5 stars if that was possible.  Got the gold menu since we want the sashimi and extra stuff. Service was fast and servers were nice. Nice decor and place was well cleaned.  It was the food that knocked that 1.5 stars off.  Ordered some kalbi which a dog wouldn't even eat (chewy).  Sashimi was average.  Sushi was good but I had to remove half of the rice from each piece.  Wasibi was non existent, we took a pea size of Wasibi alone and there was no kick at all.  Rolls were decent but kind of bland.  Sun roll is a must try though.  Overall a good place if you are in the area but don't go out of your way to go here."}
{"text":"Probably my #1 go-to spot for sushi in North York. Very small, quaint and intimate atmosphere with friendly service. Prices are fairly reasonable given the hike under new management. Usually opt for the silver menu, especially the onion-wrapped beef sirloin. Only qualm, like most AYCE restaurants, is they sometimes forget to bring all your food so I suggest ordering items at a fair pace."}
{"text":"bf and i came here last Sunday afternoon and had the gold menu for AYCE. it was less than average especially for the price, $21.99 on weekends and holidays and does not include drinks except for water and tea.

this is the only AYCE place that comes out with our order of sashimi last. 

the most disappointing part was the food. salmon sushi were huge and sliced in cubes, steak cubes came in bits and pieces but was decent, buttered mushrooms were burnt, masago was too salty due to low quality, beef tataki was not fresh, i think the kalbi ribs were old cause they were so chewy i couldnt chew through them, spider roll was the worst! i couldnt even drink the tea cause the cups had such a strong bleach scent.

needless to say, we will not be returning and would not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I have dined here twice with a friend, both times for lunch. We had made a reservation because we purchased a deal but it wasn't necessary, there were only a couple of tables occupied. 

Upon arriving, the server was very friendly, greeted us and gave us the menu's. We have tried the Vegetarian Pan Fried Noodle- the flavour was average but the portion was worth the price. Spicy Salmon Rolls/Spicy Tuna Rolls- delicious and very fresh!  I tried the Deep Fried Oysters- fresh and were fairly good considering I am not a huge fan of oysters! Crispy Rolls- it was decent, not amazing. Smoke N Fire Rolls- it was very good but also very filling. Salmon Skin Maki- this was yummy!

Overall, I would definitely come back here again. Service was excellent and servers are very friendly. They speak fluent English which is a plus! The food is very fresh, not sure about during dinner but it was good both times I have gone here. Oh and they do not have lunch specials on the weekends, only weekdays!"}
{"text":"I have been to this sushi way too many times. I am even friends with the owner now (he is very nice). Last time the food wasn't good tho so I haven't been ever since (2months). I recommend you go during the weekends since the food is fresh. I will give it 5 stars because this is indeed my go to sushi place and most of the times it is good (go on the weekends)."}
{"text":"Very slow service. White tuna sashimi was yellow in colour. Beef sashimi was frozen. They bring out half of what you order and they take so long to bring it to you. Its their way to scam you to eat less. Quality of the meet was poor and the fish wasn't fresh."}
{"text":"Pretty fresh sushi, a wide variety of choices and extremely nice owner! The price was reasonable as well. I ll definitely visit this place again."}
{"text":"Really nice ambience. Went for the silver menu. 

The food was quick to come, but had to ask for soy sauce and tea couple of times, he kept of forgetting it. Spicy salmon Sushi was not as nice and the any roles with crispy tempura had a strong oil taste, which overwhelmed the salmon taste 

Then steak, dragon role, mango maki was very good. I think the deep fried banana with chocolate was amazing, it's a must eat here. So much better compare to a lot of other AYCE.

Overall, not as good as I expected based on other reviews."}
{"text":"Lunch Specials! 

$4.99 for a Katsu Don Set that comes with soup and salad 

$5.99 for either a Tempura/Chicken Teriyaki bento box 

Tekka Sushi is just right across from Fairview Mall but hidden inside one of the side street. My Yelp \"Blogger\" Friend asked me if I ever been there or if I know about it.... Not really... but I ready to try anything Japanese so off I go looking for lunch specials. 

Their website has that usual disclaimer about prices subject to change. Tekka lunch special prices is cheaper than what they posted on their website! I am not complaining if things are cheaper?! 

Assorted Sushi Set ($8.99) 
- Salad has this light sesame dressing which I really enjoyed.. and was presented with thoughts.... 
- Sushi was exactly how it was shown in the photo... 
- Quality wise is not A-OK, I have better but for the price I paid I am not complaining.. 
- I wish there is more nigri..instead of just 4 and the rest were all rolls 

The interior is nice and clean. The lone waitress was efficient and friendly. Japanese songs in the background... but waitress is Chinese speaking :) 

Be careful when hiking down the washroom... the stairs are steep... I almost rolled all the way down and hmmm washrooms not the cleanest.. sticky floors etc... 

If you are in the area, I definitely suggest coming here for their lunch!! The price point is even cheaper than what you can get in the Food Court at Fairview!!"}
{"text":"not good, prices raised. went to try the silver menu and they raised the price to $17. Meat dishes were dry and hard. Curry dishes too much rice. 

if you happen to end up here then some few good things are:
tempura shrimp
dynamite roll
sirloin with enoki"}
{"text":"This was a quiet location that was hidden in a plaza that cannot be seen from Shepard. However everything about this place was nice. There were a number of good things about the food being served. Things were fresh and they were made to order. I especially enjoyed the mango roll and dynamite roll. I plan on coming back for some more all you can eat sushi. 

However be warned. It is more expensive on Friday and the weekends. After tax was $25 on a Friday lunch."}
{"text":"Nothing crazy special, the meat is good compared to other places I have been. The sushi is really good and there is a wide variety of food. On the outside it seems like its a run down place, but on the inside its really modern and looks great."}
{"text":"Très bon poulet teriyaki, sauf qu'il faut appeler avant pour savoir s'il en font. pour ceux qui aime les sushis, vous êtes au bon endroit"}
{"text":"Great place that's close by Fairview Mall. The restaurant has two menus: a Silver and a Gold menu. The Gold menu features more sushi and sashimi. The choice is up to you. 

The place was very clean and the servers were nice. You indicate your orders on a sheet (except for desert where you tell the server what you would like), which I think is a huge plus for AYCE restaurants. 

The quality of the sashimi was quite good and the sizes of the rolls are just right. The cooked food items are also a great choice too. I ordered the chicken curry rice which was flavoured nicely and didn't feel too fatty. The food doesn't take too long to come out except for the cooked items for obvious reasons. 

It's hard to find great AYCE sushi restaurants in North York. This is definitely a spot to check out!"}
{"text":"Acceptable snd Good service. Different  sort  of items to choose  from the menus (for all you can eat style). Quality are acceptable but  slightly overpriced. It has a friendly environment."}
{"text":"When I arrived to pick up the takeout, I was worried because of the all you can eat sign.  I do have some preferred AYEC places incl. Maison du Japon at Denison/Woodbine.

Quality of the sushi is very bad ... especially the maki rolls.   I ordered 3 different types with a buddy and the tempura in all 3 of them was soggy and it also contained barely any fish (like 5 parts tempura 1 part fish).   

Bad quality and bad value.   I would not return."}
