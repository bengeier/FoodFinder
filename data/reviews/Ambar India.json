{"text":"Tried the lunch buffet (takeout). Cheaper than other Indian places in the area but due to the small location size less variety of food as well (half the buffet table is salad bar/dessert/sauces), so it evens out. Nice touch: they weigh the buffet takeout, so you don't have to pay the full price if you don't load up.

Naan: just ok, but I did get takeout so it might've suffered a bit in transit. Naan is best fresh and hot.

veggie korma: very good, nicely spicy, good flavor, vegetables were good quality.

pekora: nicely crunchy even after sitting in a styrofoam box for a few minutes, little salty.

palak chana: good, nicely spicy and flavorful, right thickness of sauce

kidney bean chickpea thing I forget the name of: kind of bland, I usually expect more fire in this dish.

tandoori chicken: not great, surprisingly. It was dry and surprisingly hot (spice wise) while being less flavorful than I'm used to. Maybe it'd just been sitting around for awhile (its hard to make dark meat dry!)

lemon rice: yellow rice with fried peanuts in it. I liked the peanuts, gave it a nice crunch, but didn't really taste anything else flavor wise; could've just been plain old basmati rice.

chicken curry: ok, this is why this place dropped a full star. The chicken curry is bone in, which would be fine if it were whole bone, but the bone is cleaver-chopped, which leaves tiny shards of barely-detectable bone EVERYWHERE. Seriously I was picking through this thing like I was dissecting in a lab to make sure I didn't kill myself with every bite. I don't even remember how it tasted. I realize this is 'authentic' but so is using a cow-dung oven to make naan and I'm betting they don't do that. Debone your chicken curry, you're gonna get sued.

The interior decor is really quite nice (a huge change from when it was Wonderdogs, you won't recognize the place), the music wasn't too loud, there was a refreshing lack of tv blaring in the corner, the proprietors are very nice and conscientious, and things were moving along well in such a tight space (you're not going to like it at lunch rush if you're claustrophobic/have a phobia of strange people bumping up against/brushing by you). The vegetarian dishes are better than the meat dishes, and I didn't try everything available on the lunch buffet (two or three more items, a lentil soup, desserts (mango custard sounds really good but I didn't want to mingle flavors).

Feels like the vegetarian dishes were better than the meat-based ones, and there is plenty of vegetarian on offer. Wish they'd add samosas to the buffet. Overall I'd recommend it if you want Indian buffet but don't want/don't have time to leave campus, just avoid the chicken curry, especially if you're feeding kids or something."}
{"text":"I been going there since year but every time I went this restaurant is shut down with health department I was curious why is closed then I read the health department sign at the door they had so many critical violations repeated that's why it been closed. Buffet is cheap but poor hygiene I I'll not recommended to go there if you want healthy food"}
{"text":"We have tried Ambar India's lunch buffet a couple of times and the dinner buffet once. Both are similar. And, overall, the food isn't bad per se but it's not in the same league as Indian restaurants in Chicago. In fact, Bombay Indian Grill on First Street, Champaign had better ambiance and a superior buffet selection at about the same price but it closed down, leaving Ambar the only Indian buffet in town. 

Food's hit or miss here. Chicken pakora starter isn't always part of the spread but it tastes good. Tikka masala's perfectly fine but the tough and almost flavorless tandoori chicken's nothing to write home about. Ditto for lamb curry, which was essentially chewy meat in a generic brown sauce. 

Naan bread's always lukewarm. However, the bhatura bread they had as part of a rather nice Mother's Day buffet spread a couple of years ago, although very calorific, wasn't bad at all. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for some of the other rotating items. \"Hara bhara kabob\" was drenched in a disturbing green food color--and, on top of that, had little flavor to speak of. Chilli chicken was inexcusably bad. 

Plain rice's alright. Other rice dishes usually are not. Their chicken biryani might as well have been called generic yellow rice, lacking as it did the complex spices and rich flavors of a quintessential Indian dish that any Indian restaurant worth its salt should know how to make!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is perfect. Both taste and price. I fell in love with India food after I firstly came here. I strongly recommend especially for Chinese student like me."}
{"text":"Four of us went there for their lunch buffet for $7.99, which is quite a good price with all the food we have, definitely better deal than Bombay. All are all happy with their buffet.  One suggestion is to label their food better, but when we asked questions, they explained to us in great detail."}
{"text":"I was there on a lunch buffet. Food wasn't great and they were out of some foods or it looked like they weren't interested in refilling it. Won't recommend it if you really want to taste some authentic Indian food. People are nice though."}
{"text":"I went here recently on an almuni trip with some friends and were recommended to go here for lunch. The restaurant was very clean and had nice decor and lighting. We were pleasantly pleased by the lunch buffet selection, there was a good variety of different foods. Prices were very reasonable for lunch. And for a weekend during summer break, there was a respectable crowd in the restaurant (showing the popularity of such a new restaurant).
While the food was not as spectacular as Bombay Grill, the pricing and variety will mean we will probably be back here on the next campus visit."}
{"text":"The food was okay; average quality that you can get anywhere. Came in at 2:50 for the 20% at 3pm, and they made us wait for the deal. When we came back we paid for the buffet, and most of the options were not refilled. Then the employees were very rude and snobby. Afterwards, I got food poisoning, called to get a refund, and was promised $30 back. My husband went to get the refund, and they only gave him $10 back. I will never go here again. There are way better places to spend my money"}
{"text":"When I heard that a new Indian restaurant was opening up right next to campus, I could hardly contain my joy. Campustown badly needed another budget Indian restaurant, and Ambar India fills the void perfectly. 

By no means am I an Indian food connoisseur, but the dishes that comes from both menu and buffet service taste phenomenal. I have been there several times, and I can't exactly recall the names of the things I ate, but trust me, they're great. And if one particular dish doesn't satisfy your palate, there are plenty more that will. The buffet changes daily, so there's no shortage of new flavors to try. Best of all, the lunch buffet is only $8, probably one of the cheapest and most fulfilling meals you can get for your money.

Vegetarian options are limited for the buffet, but as a meat-eater, it isn't much of a concern. If you're looking for something with more flavor and spice, try ordering a dish off the menu, but be aware that the portion sizes are a bit on the small side."}
{"text":"My review applies to the lunch buffet only, I may (or may not) try the dinner menu. I found it average at best, the kind of Indian food that is good for people who don't like Indian food. Boringly mild, and lacking the range of flavors that is so appealing about subcontinental cuisine. I may return, but it will likely require some kind of sedative, or grand deception.

The establishment itself is clean, and the people friendly. As far as restaurants go, it's fairly good (except for the food)."}
{"text":"Had the lunch buffet and it was great! $7.99 Everyone working was very kind and checked out us multiple times as well."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Even though it's cramped and the crowd control is usually a disaster. Even though there are people milling around your table while you're trying to eat. But the nail in the coffin was the fact that I've gotten sick (digestive system upset) every single time I've been here. I love Indian food and I haven't had this problem at any of the other area restaurants. The nan tastes good but not good enough to spend a night in the bathroom."}
{"text":"Buffet here is definitely worth it. Chicken tikka masala is loaded with white meat chicken and they refill dishes often, unlike some buffets. Chicken biryani has a little bit of a kick to it, but most of the dishes aren't very spicy. Papad (lentil chips) are delicious and addictive. Sometime they will have saag mushroom, sometimes curry with paneer, the lineup is different depending on what day you get there, but there are usually 3 kinds of curry dishes plus various others. All items were fresh, and there were very few buffet items we didn't like. Very casual atmosphere and affordable."}
{"text":"I came here for the lunch buffet. At the time I left I was planning on giving this place 4 stars. It had everything a good value buffet should: decent selection, flavorful food, low price. But my body's reaction over the next few hours require me to remove two of those stars. I didn't get completely sick to the point of puking or having my intestines turn to sludge, but I did feel weak and uncomfortable for the rest of the day. I know that the whole point of buffets is to sacrifice quality for quantity and variety, but having food that's clean enough to not make me sick shouldn't be a particularly high standard to meet."}
{"text":"Great Indian food loaded with spices and flavor. The interior is extremely casual--it's not exactly the place to go on a date, but for a casual get together with friends it works. The buffet option makes it worth the cost. Their carryout option is particularly useful, so you have the option to eat your food at home for potentially even less money than sitting down and eating (they weigh the carry out box by the pound instead of the regular flat fee for the buffet). 

After having visited Ambar over the course of several years, I have never been disappointed. Vegetarian options may sometimes be lacking, but the meat is quite good. I highly recommend the red chicken and mushroom saag! I do, however, wish the interior looked more neat and organized with a cozier feel, which is why I am giving four stars instead of five. For what this place is--a restaurant on campus, designed to feed students tasty Indian food at an affordable price--it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"Buffet is good and fairly cheap. First time i went they laughed at me for eating the food wrong but w.e. Come here its fantastic."}
{"text":"They do have variety of items in their buffet but whats the use of such variety which ends  taking u to restrooms....
I got my stomach upset kind of dyria ended up in hospital emergency.
I dont know how so many people  could not see these flaws..and then i got to know thet got closed for a short period of time by the health department  due to some health violations..

All i can say is ONE SHOULD ALWAYS GO FOR QUALITY INSTEAD OF QUANTITY.."}
{"text":"I personally love this little place. Good Indian food for a decent price. The menu is very big and you get to choose a level of spice. I work near Ambar and stop by a few times a month. They are fast and it tastes delicious."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good, but it was a bit more expensive than the other Indian restaurants on campus. The waiters were pretty nice,  but the took a while top give us the checks."}
{"text":"Went with family. Not many vegetarian options, oily preparations. Will avoid in future."}
{"text":"Relatively better buffet options than other local Indian restaurants. Suitably located near the U of I campus. They have at least 2 to 3 chicken dishes in their buffet. Should have more options for desserts."}
{"text":"There were no Paneer pieces in Shahi Paneer. When I told the attendant he said they grind the Paneer into the curry! The tandoori chicken has the red color, but is tasteless. It feels like they made it hours ago and jut put it on the buffet now
Lol this place is a joke for Indian food. Seems to be college students are working here who don't care at all about the taste or quality of the food."}
{"text":"This review is for the buffet.
Cheap quality 
Clearly can tell the meat and vegetables used in the dishes are old
Not authentic Indian food.
Indian food is supposed to be a blend of spices not a blend of preservatives"}
{"text":"No no no no no, a hundred times no. This is not Indian food. PERIOD. All curries taste the same and the kababs are dry and bland. I don't know what that mango custard is but it's not mango. On occaision I have found one or the other item in the buffet to be palatable. But that's not nearly enough. Bottom line is, most Indian restaurants in CU are, for the most part, not Indian at all."}
{"text":"I've always loved Indian food and this is definitely one of the best on campus! You gonna love the tasty curry and the naan!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered food for delivery and they did a terrible job. Bad communicators, didn't make any effort to assure I got my food and even hung up on me. Would never use again."}
{"text":"your typical cheap Indian buffet. Not much around in Champaign so I appreciate there is one. 
If you are hungry, they have the basic Indian items in the buffet. Don't expect something fancy, but it's good.

service is meh.. but who cares if you are just there to stuff your face with food."}
{"text":"Go between 3 and 5 and get the buffet for $8 which is really really cheap. 

For indians - Have the goat curry in the buffet menu ( If available)"}
{"text":"this place is new and the quality of food is very good. They have an interesting selection of food for the lunch buffet. Their Tikka masalas are awesome!"}
{"text":"This is currently my favorite Indian restaurant in CU.  I like their Palak Paneer better than my version (I tend to prefer mine to Bombay and Sitara) and really appreciate the ability to order online and specify spice levels. I also enjoy the aloo tikki and plan on trying more dishes here."}
{"text":"Limited variety in their buffet. Their vegetarian options aren't as good as their chicken, and they usually have chicken tikka masala out in their lunch buffet. Their naan is okay."}
{"text":"In a town where most of India restaurants are below average. This place is reasonable. Decent taste, well priced.

BTW buffet is below average. I always get takeaways which are much better. Don't judge this place by buffet."}
{"text":"Although it is has a decent unlimited buffet for the price that it is, the food is quite bland and not the real Indian taste. Can do much better with such a good location."}
{"text":"I am not Indian. I am not Indian American. I do not eat this cuisine very much. But I am a huge fan. Oddly enough, apparently, there are some bad reviews for this place by \"authentic\" reviewers. I respect these views and have no beef. Having said that, take my review with a grain of salt. I got the lunch buffet. 

I wasn't expecting too much given that the majority of mid-price-level restaurants in town (especially the ethnic ones) are usually mediocre. Compared to a few other places I have been to in town, however, Ambar was surprisingly great. I'm not an Indian food connoisseur, but I do like to think that I have a decent enough palate to distinguish between crap and good. This place is very good--harsh reviews be damned. I got the buffet. The variety was surprisingly large with different curries, all of which were (again) surprisingly flavorful (yet not too salty). This is a selling point since other \"good\" Indian restaurants I have been to (including decent Indian restaurants in \"ethnic\" California) either are too salty or too bland. Ambar hit the sweet spot of flavorful but not crazy salty. Likewise, despite what other reviewers have said (again, I am no expert but...) I found the food quality to be quite good. Meats felt sufficiently succulent and the veggies were sufficiently fresh (looking and tasting). So there's that. 

And to top it off, the desserts (\"Indian donut\" balls) and a pudding (possibly canned; yes, no one is perfect) were also a nice end to a filling meal. It set me back only about $10 and the ambiance inside was busy and warm. Service was a bit on the cold side (including the front desk) but I suppose that's to be expected to some extent with the \"ethnic\" restaurants on campus (\"Western\" food, conversely, can be overly in your face with all the \"hi's\" and \"how are you's...\" so...) 

Conclusion: for the price, this place is high value. I recommend."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch. Honestly I have had better indian food than this but what made me give one star was an incident there. As I was standing in line for buffet, a guy came out and started putting dishes (I guess he was a dish washer) First he stepped on my foot and no apology. WTH. Then he went inside, came out and hit my head. Srsly? I didn't want to make a hassle since I went with my friends but I am never going to go back to this restaurant nor recommend this place to anyone. Owner should train his employees."}
{"text":"I have eaten here over 10 times and I can't believe that I haven't written a review yet.  I don't know where to start in this review.  The two factors in regards to me liking a place are 1) the food and 2) the service 3) if much of its clientele hails from the region in which they represent/serve (only important to ethnic establishments).  I could care less about the ambiance or anything else like that.  

The Food- They have a buffet and a menu.  I have eaten a lot of Indian food, but I haven't even scratched the surface of everything that is out there.  If you're like me an occasional (or in my case 3X in one week) trip to their buffet will help you discover new Indian dishes.  They serve different items everyday.  The buffet menu of the day is posted on their FB page.   Through this buffet I have discovered my love for paneer and Indo-Chinese.  In addition, they occasionally put out items not in their normal menu, such as the amazing Chicken 65.  I have ordered out on their regular menu on three or four occasions based off of amazing items I discovered from their buffet.  They have an extensive menu of roughly 100 items.

The service- I have never had an issue with the service here.  I am as white and as pale as can be, but I love my spicy food even though it doesn't love me.  Due to my genetic flaw I may drink a lot of water when eating spicy food.  They are usually quick to refill my water, which is extremely important to me.  Tonight I officially met the owner even though I had spoken with him there on several occasions.  He is an extremely nice guy and has helped me navigate the menu when I have had questions.  He seems to genuinely enjoy his business and being there.

The other stuff- Yes, a lot of Indians eat here, which means a lot when it comes to ethnic establishments.  If they are eating it then it must be good.  The other stuff including the ambiance and prices are unimportant to me if the two previously mentioned requirements are great.  I guess they are of some importance as I prefer to eat in clean places and don't have endless funds.  Moving along...the restaurant isn't big.  There is limited seating and it can be packed (a good sign).  It is clean, but there is nothing special about the ambiance (again, unimportant to me).  

The prices hear are a cheap.  The buffet runs under $9 regardless of it being lunch or dinner.  Most of the menu items also run less than $9.  in fact, I can't recall anything running more than $9.  

I think you should easily conclude that I recommend this place if you like good Indian food."}
{"text":"Awesome food with amazing variety of indian cuisine. It feels jus like havin lunch in a nice dhaba in India! A humble suggestion for non indian patrons...kindly try to opt more for vegetarian options to have a more savory experience. Don't miss on the Chaat samosa and gulab jamuns here!"}
{"text":"Food is good but the service was terrible when I ordered carry out. My food was supposed to be ready 20 minuyes after i placed my order but wasnt ready until 40 minutes after I ordered. After I paid, the guy didn't give me my change then gave me an attitude when I asked for it. Service is usually fine but this was a very unpleasant experience, I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"My friends and I were really excited to come here. We all love to eat and who doesn't love Indian food? None of us had ever been to Ambar. Well, we got our food and all of us paused and just stared down at our plates for a moment. The food looked bad. Then we tried some. We were silent. One of us said \"Uh. What the fuck.\" We were baffled that we had just paid to eat this nonsense. My Indian friend was like... \"WTF\". Yeah.

I came here again and the food seems to have improved both in taste and appearance."}
{"text":"buffet is good imo. I went there with my Indian friend and she told me it's pretty close to authentic.

however not happy with takeaway buffet option. was charged $9 for food just weighed hair above 1lb ($5.99 for 1lb) which made me feel scammed. When I complained the guy at the cashier *proudly* pressed the scale to 1.5lb. Mind-blown. (plz, your finger is not in my takeaway box) 

not want to argue over a few bucks but it simply made the customer discontent with the experience. especially for people like me who consider experience and service over taste in rating. 

highly impossible to revisit."}
{"text":"I have ordered food from here on a regular basis via Grubhub.  I don't think they even read the order as it prints out at their end.  Sometimes they forget items that were paid for.  Today I ordered their channa masala and a bhatura.  Asked for the channa to be a 5/6 on the spice scale.  Not only was it not spicy, it had no flavor.  Chick peas in a mediocre sauce.  Asked for some onions and green chillies on the side and guess what - nothing.  I doubt I will ever order from this joint again."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food whether you order off the menu or get the buffet. Only complaint about the buffet is I always overeat. Staff is incredibly friendly and make the experience enjoyable, whether you're sitting down or grabbing food to go."}
{"text":"I personally love this place. It's so tasty and you get a bunch of food for only $8 if you order the buffet option. All of the workers are really friendly too and are really responsive waiters. I crave it every now and then so I'll stop by 2-3 times a month. They have some really good rice pudding and a bunch of awesome Indian dishes that i don't even know the name of but will shove my mouth anyways. I always leave happy and tired from eating too much."}
{"text":"We were craving Indian food while on the road about two hours from home returning from vacation.  I assumed there might be some good places near UIUC.  And while this joint is nothing to write home about on the outside, it is the inside that matters.

And boy, is that inside good! My party of six all had the buffet, and everyone loved it.  It might have been the best meal we had on vacation, and the price was right to boot.  The food was spicy enough to please my heat-loving palate, but there were mild entrees for the less adventurous.  Service was, in a word, good! And you can't always say that.

All in all, I'm glad this restaurant is far enough from home that I cannot just hop in the car and go there any time, because if I could, I'd be there twice a week."}
{"text":"I don't know why it took me so long to try this place, but I am in love with their tikka masala! And vegi korma. And their pakoras are great! The buffet is also a decent deal, though I'm always too full after one plate to go back for another one.

The only critique I really have is that I wish they had their own delivery service, since Mr. Delivery's fees are ridiculous, but I get that it's probably not financially viable to have drivers. Ah well, I can just call in orders for pick up. :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the vegetable and rice dish. I asked for mild. I really couldn't enjoy the dish because it was still way too spicy. The portion size was good but the food was just OK. Very few vegetarian choices on the buffet. The staff wasn't very friendly. Definitely didn't feel warm and inviting.  Can't say I'll be back, too many other places to try."}
{"text":"Found a cockroach? on the napkins right next to the buffet. They said you shouldn't?  worry all restaurants have cockroaches..."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Indian cuisine, although the amount of choices to select from was somewhat limited. I enjoyed the food, although it was not amazing. I don't know, there was just something that was lacking to really make this place stand out."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food located near campus. The buffets are amazing -- the lunch buffet is $11 and the dinner buffet is $12. Definitely a big draw for a college student on a budget. There are a la carte dishes for around $10, but if you think you can eat more than just one plate of food in a sitting, the buffet is worth it. Make sure you arrive a bit early for lunch and dinner so that the buffets are still warm."}
{"text":"Another excellent buffet dinner ($10 cash!). They have a variety of meat and vegetarian dishes, with sides and dessert. Tonight the saag mushroom was verrry creamy. The chicken tikki masala was sooo good! The dal was spicy but the curry was not. The soji was simple but good, not too sweet. Perfect naan. Eat up!"}
{"text":"I was so excited when Ambar opened up! My husband and I LOVE Indian food. So much so, that we had it catered at our wedding! 

The food here is delicious. The lamb korma is PERFECT to my liking. Trust me, I get it everywhere...  The naan is huge and fresh. The portions are decent. Sometimes I get my own dish, sometimes I split one with my husband.

I prefer the menu to the buffet, but I feel that way just about anywhere I go. However, a lot of people do get the buffet.

It can get really busy being next to campus, so if you don't like crowds, avoid this place on a Friday night. The prices are decent. The staff is friendly. If you're on campus and want Indian food, go to Ambar and not Bombay. Seriously."}
{"text":"This is my go place on campus lately- close to my department, reasonably priced, and the food is great. My only complaint is that the naan could be a bit crispier. Their saag paneer and chicken tikka masala is very good. I'm not one to get too hung up on service, but theirs is excellent as well. 

The only downfall is limited seating- But, if the place is full, as it usually is around 12-1, you can get take out buffet by the lb."}
{"text":"Sorry, I never give bad reviews but there was a fly in our food AND I saw a large and strikingly grotesque roach near the kitchen as I went to pay. Also it was clear they didn't want to make me fresh food, although they did. They were pushing me to use the buffet however I refused when I was told the buffet had been out since 11am (it was 5pm!). Also the atmosphere was terrible due to the owners (or managers?) airing out their personal issues in less than savory language during our meal (in another language, but one which I understand). 

Prior to this bad dine in experience I once ordered carry out and came to find them shoveling their buffet food into to-go boxes... and then charging me normal price.

The food itself wasn't bad, but it also wasn't great.

I definitely won't be eating there again."}
{"text":"Proabably one of the worst Indian places I've been to over the last few years. This is not authentic Indian food. 

The kebabs, at least that's what they call them, are nothing but tasteless pieces of meat that are overpowered with red food colouring. The curries are simply watered down and above all, there are huge raw pieces of onions and green peppers in them.

I would rather eat a bowl of cereal than have this as a meal again. Definitely not coming here again."}
{"text":"So grateful to have Ambar India on campus. Their menu is pretty much always the same but it's reliable. The staff is really great!"}
{"text":"I didn't go home for Easter and didn't feel like cooking on a somewhat hungover Sunday afternoon. Time for some Indian food!

I had heard good things about Ambar and it was unsurprisingly open on Easter so we gave it a shot.

The place is really small on the inside, there were not many seats so we snagged a table for 2 after paying for our buffet. I liked the place though, it was pretty cute on the inside, complete with authentic decorations and some catchy Indian radio station.

I browsed the buffet and everything looked so mouthwatering! I think I tried 95% of the stuff they had out there. I'm going to try and remember (and spell) the names correctly, but forgive me if I'm a little off. The dishes that really stood out to me were the mutter paneer, saag mushroom, the spicy chicken (65 I think it's called?), and the fried dough balls and spongey dessert thing (sorry I have no idea what the proper name is).

Overall I was actually pleasantly surprised at how good the food was. Most of it was pretty fresh, much tastier, and even cheaper than the last buffet we went to (Casablanca). Out of the three Indian places I've tried on or near campus, I liked Ambar the best out of Sitara and Casablanca.

I love being able to get so many different cuisines on campus, Indian food grows more and more on me every time I have it!

Recommended for sure!"}
{"text":"So this place suffers the same issue that all buffets do: average quality food for $10. If you want some Indian food, then it's fairly good. The choices don't seem many compared with other buffets. The coconut soup had a piquant spicy taste to it that I suggest anyone try."}
{"text":"Unfortunately a bit hit or miss.  Sometimes the food here is spectacular and absolutely on point and my friends and I will gorge until we're stuffed for days and regretting our decisions in life.   But, even when the food is good however I recognize that it isn't as flavorful as it should/could be for Indian cuisine. Other days the food is just almost unpalatable and doesn't look like it should be served."}
{"text":"No complaints here. The food is really good and the restaurant is run well for the amount of ppl frequenting the location."}
{"text":"I was first excited about a new Indian restaurant. However, after going here twice, I was pretty disappointed with the food and service here. There aren't many selections in the buffet. Also, many of the dishes are slightly bland and taste the same. I guess that is to be expected in a buffet. Also, the service here was horrendous to almost non-existent. If you want authentic Indian food, I suggest finding an alternative place."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! It is my favorite place to eat. The waiters are polite and friendly. The service is good."}
{"text":"Offensively bad. I have never had worse Indian food. The rice tasted gross and was not basmati. Everything else was flavorless and not recognizable as Indian food. The naan was stale. My boyfriend and I went for the buffet today and left after fifteen minutes, unable to find something remotely good. I've had better and fresher tasting Indian food from the Whole Foods food bar or from a box. If you want delicious authentic Indian food that go to Bombay or Curry House.  Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"First time when I went to ambar India for buffet, I was hungry and could have eaten anything. So, I enjoyed my food like anything. And, also told my husband that we are coming to this place twice a week. Guess, I was possessed by the spirit of my hungry stomach which was now filled. However, when I came second time I realized that first time I just ate without savoring the food. Anyways, there is nothing to savor much. Food is mediocre, and the only thing which I liked was dal makhni. Rest was average. Yes, they have a good selection of dishes in buffet but not one tastes wow. We seriously need good Indian restaurants in Champaign. I believe my great cooking has set such a high expectation for Indian restaurants, that very few have beaten it ;)

Tip: go after 5:30 pm for dinner because before that the food is cold as most of the crowd comes after 5:30 and then only they refill it with hot food."}
{"text":"I love coming to this place! Their food is pretty good. I have never ordered from the buffet. I have only tried the chicken tikka masala and it's really good. Sometimes they don't put enough chicken - so I just ask them to put extra chicken in. Their rice is nice and fluffy. I know it's very Indian-basic of me to ONLY order the chicken tikka masala (\"CTM\"), but when something is already so delicious why try something new? I will try and order more items - but for the time being, I am perfectly happy with the CTM. The chicken is nice and tender and the sauce is flavorful - not too spicy. The decor inside is nice. There is ample seating."}
