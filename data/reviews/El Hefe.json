{"text":"This place sucks. I wasn't let in because I had a temporary drivers license that I had got 2 days ago in Texas. I also had a had copy of my Texas security license, and my old i.d card from texas. All issued by the dmv, all with the same picture and DOB. Apparently the state of Arizona doesnt accept real licenses....it wouldnt be so bad, but the \"security\" were assholes."}
{"text":"Ignore the 5/5 reviews from the employees, this place is bogus.   Poorly made drinks and botched food orders during the day, RACIST bouncers at night that actually told my group everyone but my black friend could get in.  Unbelievable in 2014 that employeesare enabled by the El Hefe owners and managers to openly discriminate.  This place is doing a great job of bringing sub-par, snotty service to the otherwise Mill and deserves to be gone in a few months...frankly Canteen was much better."}
{"text":"The food was the only good thing. We waited for 15 minutes before we were acknowledged, and it wasn't busy. The service was terrible - we were constantly repeating our drink orders because she would forget, or she would be annoyed because we interrupted her flirting."}
{"text":"I was here watching the Cardinals Texas 6th Game of the world series.  Great evening of good food and unique margaritas.    Was there the Saturday afternoon before Halloween, just more of the same.  The tacos were great and the margaritas are fairly light so great for the afternoon.    The service was great even in a fairly busy environment.  The beer taps on the table were a favorite of the males around while the late not music kept the place rocking."}
{"text":"This place discriminates majorly! A white guy goes in wearing the EXACT same shoes and the black guy is told he can't come in?? Either they're racist or the bouncers don't want any good looking guys inside. If you like the douchey type and bad music.. Go here lol"}
{"text":"SCAMMERS!  If you pay your tab in cash...make sure you DO NOT forget your card (credit or bank). If you do, when you go back to pick it up, they'll charge your card for the total amount of your bill...  AND...you may find additional fraudulent charges like I did. I  n the day that management had my card someone purchased an item from  Barnes and NobleCredit and a Credit Report.   Now that's customer service."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a margarita, beer and appetizer. The place was busy as the Tempe art festival was underway. The hostess told us the wait was 45 minutes. She was really stressed out. We eventually made our way to the bar and sat down. I ordered a margarita off the specialty menu. I watched my drink get poured out of a premade jug. No taste of tequila at all. I asked the bartender if that was normal. She said yes. I let her know I was truly disappointed. If your going to put specialty drinks on your menu, make them that way. Salsas were terrible. I will not go back to this place or suggest it to anyone. Beware."}
{"text":"So I seem to have a love-hate relationship with this place. At times I love it and at times I hate. Lately it's been the latter of the two unfortunately. Going here for food wasn't bad. In fact, it was delish, but going here and experiencing the night life has not been awesome as it once was. While it is in part due to the people that go here - a bunch of douchey guys and the girls that go with them (it is Old Town) - I can deal with them cause mixed in there are some cool people. What I can't deal with are some of the people working there, starting with the door guys who seem to relish the power and enjoy letting people know it. And if they weren't bad enough, let's get into the bartenders.   I've known some bartenders and I did the whole bar tending thing and no where in all that I learned and know, did they mention giving people crap service. I get it, you're busy and you get slammed, but you get through it and they should want to take and make as many drinks as they can rather than being all selective and choosing certain people over others. I'm sorry, I don't want to swoon over the bartenders, I just want my drink. And, when they finally decide to deign me with their presence and place my order, they get it wrong. And trying to flag them back over after they hand you your bill to point out the mistake wasn't even worth trying since trying to get their attention the first time too a bit of work.   The servers were all right; haven't had anyone exceptional to rave or rant about. The music is usually pretty awesome. And as I've said, there are some pretty awesome people worth going back for, as well as their food. I do enjoy their happy hour menu. I just know that before going to El Hefe, I need to start out somewhere else if I want a drink and then head over, as is the usual plan when we go out."}
{"text":"I am not a resident of Tempe. While visiting family members who are, I have attempted to get in twice within a two year span. Both times I was turned away at the door. Once for wearing brand new(literally)basketball sneakers and last night for wearing camouflage cargo shorts which were also fairly new. I searched near and far on the Internet for a dress code for this establishment and all I could find was casual followed by a no dress restrictions block. It's pretty embarrassing being turned away for something I hadn't known of. I have to slam this place, being in the heart of a college campus, who would have thought this place was upscale while visibly witnessing a bunch of drunk people at the bar area from outside? I don't use this as a tool of reasoning or for any other benefit, but I am currently an active duty service member in the armed forces. I saw there is a military appreciation benefit at your Chicago location. I advise making your \"at the door\" dress code known before hosting this event, as many others in the service dress just as I do.  I'm from around Chicago area and will be sure to let my fellow service members know what to expect at the door if they choose not to wear khakis and dress shoes at the door."}
{"text":"I will never come here again. They continue to discriminate, and be prejudice towards people to maintain a certain look. It is absolutely ridiculous and disgusting the way they treat people, especially now being in 2016. Just another place that gives Mill a bad name. I will never be a customer here in the future and will encourage everyone I know to do the same."}
{"text":"Went in the afternoon when it was slower - great tacos and the beergarita was very good. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Be careful when you go there because I was there two weeks ago. I just checked my bank account I bought only one time 3 beers for $12 and I left $2 a tip but they took $20 as a tip. Use cash only!"}
{"text":"the place is suppose to be an upscale taco bar its just plain weird. the only reason I gave it a try cuz I had promotional offers.  the place has skeletons and motor bikes etc all over the walls and they were playing weird music like power pop type music which was really annoying. the service and food could have been better as well"}
{"text":"I liked this place till we just witnessed two colored males be denied access after driving a long distance for a friends birthday because they had Jordan shoes !!!!! Really.... Unbelievable they did bag their pants, no color claiming, they were better dressed then us... I could not and will not recommend this place for the casual dresser who wears BASKETBALL SHOES!!!!"}
{"text":"Dear Mr. Hefe,  Although our end product differs, I too am in the Sales and Service industry. As you are well aware, there is never a shortage of notes from customers that wish to complain and often the compliments come few and far between. I would like to change that, today. I attended Cinco de Mayo at your establishment and had the most fun I have ever had in my life. You put on one heck of a show. From the \"girls\" that danced on the bar all night, to the \"girls\" that paraded around in bathing suits, it was impressive. Although I only ate one taco, I stared at a buffet of tacos all around me. And they were good. The DJ and the continuous ummmph ummmph from the bass provided the perfect rhythm for girls with daddy issues to rub up on strangers. Like I said earlier, you did well. Real well. The memories of easily manipulated coeds swarming your bar like a couple of retards fighting over the last two pieces of cake will not be easily erased. I can only hope that your Memorial Day party is just as sleazy and creepy!  Keep up the great work. Long live El Hefe.   - (the first tapper booth on left)"}
{"text":"the carne asada and pork tacos are my favorite in arizona!  i like how they provide mini spoons to apply the tasty salsas for the chips as well.  just go here before the party hours begin to avoid the dance crowd if you are looking for good tacos"}
{"text":"I won't be back. If you're going, make sure it's happy hour and you're only ordering off the HH menu.  Pros (if you're a young man) scantily clad servers great people-watching spot, good locale attractive layout quick service (in my experience) good service (my company had some complaints and waitstaff never acted annoyed or inconvenienced)  tequila  Cons prices  worst salsa I've ever had (I was going to order food until I had the salsa and margaritas) margaritas taste like mix and I am able to buy more than one of those for the same price that El Hefe charges for a single right down the street I'm personally not a half-naked server kinda girl and if I were, there's a Hooters nearby and, additionally, plenty of college girls in the area who don't even get paid to dress like that there were things floating in the ice  Ultimately, this is the sort of business Mill has been attracting and I can't blame it on anyone but the location and whomever manages the real estate. I'm not certain why there are always so many people with their butts parked in the patio when I pass by on my way to class but I can only assume it's the convenience of the location. I go to bars to get my drink on. I go to Mexican restaurants expecting some decent salsa. If you're the same (either booze or Mexican food), this isn't the place. If you're a college guy or a lonely older man looking for some interesting girls, this is your joint."}
{"text":"We needed a place to relax, eat, and have drinks...with two kids in tow. You all were so accommodating. The food was great and the cocktails were delicious. Will for sure visit the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"During the day: Food is marginal at best but margaritas are fantastic. The service is nothing to brag about.  At night: Usually a long wait to get in unless you are a Mill rat. Fun, high energy, usually pretty good music. Cheap drinks. My only gripe is the amount of people they let in at once. It's an ordeal to attempt to walk across the bar when it's busy to use the bathroom. Just a fair warning, you will be elbowed, spilled on, and occasionally shoved.  Bottom line: It was a sad day when Canteen closed."}
{"text":"My favorite place to grab lunch on mill. Tacos are on the smaller side, but the duck and carne are amazing"}
{"text":"Garbage rude security, denied entry to my wife and I over basketball shoes. Despite be being dressed appropriately, we got denied at the door for my shoes. The security was rude, didn't say anything except point me out the rope, and all he said was my shoes. No reasoning, no explanation, just rude. Racist ass establishment to be honest. They rather have people dressed like a bag of a$$, then respectable dressed people. Keep it up. Don't waste your time going there!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give zero.  The idiot checking IDs would not let me in because I was wearing lounge pants.  Do not enter. Go next door to whiskey row. They let us in VIP. Great music good deal on drinks. STAY AWAY FROM THIS HEFE LOCATION"}
{"text":"This place has great fajitas! I enjoyed listening to the music while enjoying dinner in the indoor outdoor youthful vibe. Everyone was friendly and the location is beyond perfect. Well done."}
{"text":"FOOD WAS HORRIBLE. I have never had to spit food out at the table before. I ordered the beef cheek taco, the duck taco, and the fish taco. They were all mushy, flavorless and the beef cheek looked like someone #2'd on my plate. I will definitely say it is the chef and not the ingredients. The Carne Asada my husband had in his taco was rare. All 3 of their salsas were bland and pretty tasteless and had no HEAT.  All around a bad dining experience... BUT the drinks are decent and so is the atmosphere, you just may want to go somewhere else for food. I wont be back"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere along with good people watching and great food and drinks! Hefe brings a bit of the Vegas night life to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great $5 happy hour margaritas! Also the tacos were very tasty. Will for sure be back"}
{"text":"Recently had a Wonderful lunch experience with friends and can't wait to go back! Kelsey was our waitress and very attentive. Ice cold draft beers and a delicious margarita with cucumbers - super refreshing! We shared Ceviche Tostada's, carne asada fries and the amazing El Hefe burger with jalapeño marmelade.... Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"The food was decent, but the service was terrible. We went there during the \"lunch rush\" which was only 5 tables that I could see, and we barely saw the waitress.   The place does have a really cool vibe though if you are looking for some place that you can go to relax. I probably won't go back again because the food wasn't good enough to deal with the service again."}
{"text":"Good food!  Avocado taco....AMAZING!  Great vibe. Good beer!  Service was slow.  But food was worth it. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Food was good, atmosphere was great, but the service was lacking. Food runners were bringing the wrong meal to the wrong customer at the bar constantly, and the female bartenders, well, at least they're pretty."}
{"text":"First time in Tempe and oh what a stop. Very interesting decor/atmosphere. Presentation was great for the food and service was good. Great stop for a drink or food."}
{"text":"9 dollar for a shot of vodka? This place is a huge scam and the waiters and the owner will do anything to steal your money. We ordered 5 shots of vodka and was charged $45, after i taling with the manager for 20 minutes, instead of even considering to fix the problem he called me a lier and told me that i got premium voda (kelt one - which i never ordered). They will scam you when they get the chance.   The security personal is also very rude and potentially intoxicated while job, as when i was talking with one of the managers/staff, the security guy tries to pick a fight and pushes me around.   Horrible place to spend the night. Stay away."}
{"text":"What a great addition to Tempe. The negative reviews smell of jealousy or ??? I've been to the one in Scottsdale and this one is bigger and full of energy. The food is great and the tacos are done very well. I work in Tempe and lunch here was perfect. Six of us had lunch, the service was quick, co worker had ceviche and really enjoyed it. A fun place, tasty food and we got back to work on time? Give it a try, it's really good."}
{"text":"Alexis is Bomb!!!! Awesome bartender.  I'm from out of town. I will definitely stop by again"}
{"text":"Shots to the dome here! I can always dig. Got a table for the homies birffday and had a killer night. Gotta check it out if you haven't."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour spot and the best place for Taco Tuesdays. They have those huge margaritas with the coronitas in them or even one with a 4 loko!   All of the servers are great and this last time I had Danielle and she was so sweet cute and attentive!   PS they have homemade churros that are soooo good!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch and the only thing better than the Tacos was the service , Taylor was very good and helped with what to order . The manager was also very helpful and moved us when asked . Dishes are made from scratch with deliciously unexpected ingredients: grilled shrimp tacos are sweetened with coconut slaw and  pork a tacos are accented by grilled pineapple salsa and pickled chili sauce.  I would totally come back for these gourmet taco creations. Well done to all !"}
{"text":"Delicious every time I come!  I love everything from the freshly made chips and salsa or guacamole to the tacos and even the salads are amazing.  The prices also can't be beat.  Tacos are only $2 on Tuesdays, and if you sign up for their weekly texts there are additional offers (this week is two for one salads).  The service is also pretty friendly and accommodating.  I called ahead on a previous visit so we wouldn't have to wait for a table on a Saturday evening for dinner.  When we arrived the hostess had gone above and beyond to secure a table away from the noisy bar area with room for a stroller for us since my sister was bringing her infant daughter.  I do wish they had high chairs but we managed.  The server also had our bill to us at 6:30 on the dot, cards already run, as we requested so we would be on time to Gammage for our show.  We definitely will continue to come back.  We've also been to the one in Old Town, but the Mill Ave location is more convenient for us and is a great weekday lunch spot.  Oh, and in response to another reviewer with a chip on his shoulder I'm NOT an employee, just someone who loves a good deal that will stretch my dining out dollars (if you check my Linked In profile you'll see I work in insurance a few miles away)."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite places.  The food is so delicious and reasonably priced and the staff is really friendly.  The music / television can be a bit loud but it is a bar so I can't really complain about it.  I like the Mill Ave location better for people watching on the patio.  Both places are dog friendly!  Everything I've tried is fresh and delicious.  I love their ceviche tostadas, salsa, chips and guac to start, but we've also had the corn dip and it's pretty good.  The tacos are all yummy, and the house salad is really good.  I haven't tried anything I didn't like.  The servers are friendlier than I would expect and that's been consistent so they hire well.  Not sure I would've tried this place based purely on appearances and the bar atmosphere because it's not really our style, but the food keeps bringing us back.  I love it for lunch or an early dinner."}
{"text":"I had the chicken enchiladas street corn & tacos . nothing to brag about .but the churro sundae was amazing .. The bartender was nice..all the servers are sexy . it was early morning so it was kinda empty"}
{"text":"I usually only go to this place at night when it's more of a club scene, but recently I went in on taco Tuesday and I'm glad I did. I sat down and was immediately greeted by the bartender, Alyssa. She was very attentive and recommended the fried avocado tacos, which were amazing. I'll definitely stop by to get tacos again soon."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE customer service!  Last night, me, my husband and coworker decided to swing by for some tacos. Earlier on in the day, they stopped by our hotel with some 'Buy One, Get One Entree.' cards. We also had a  'Drink Ticket' and 'Taco Ticket' that we previously received from EL Hefe. We walked in, saw three empty seats at the bar and took them. We sat there for probably five minutes without any type of greeting. It was until the bartender walked over and told us \"I have a guy sitting here.\" We had no issue with that. We moved over to a table close to the bar. Within seconds, a couple of guys who had just walked in, sat where we previously sat. She immediately walked over, greeted them, asked them if they were eating and handed them menus. It was just a slap in the face.   No biggie though. We placed our Drink and Taco tickets on the table and Samantha, our server, walked over gave us menus. She clearly saw the tickets laid out on the table. We all placed our drink order, three Dos Equis. It was until she came back and said \"Oh, those drink tickets don't work on these.\" Umm...okay. You failed to mention that before we ordered our drinks because? At this point, we gave up and asked for our check. We no longer wanted to order any food or deal with the customer service this location had to offer. It was nothing but attitude since the moment we walked in. I definitely won't return."}
{"text":"Great place here drinks are good and highly recommend to anyone in the area. Come here every weekend"}
{"text":"i like this place, never went when its crowded. But during the day its laid back, prices are average but the food is decent and staff is always friendly. Jarel is the manager i believe and hes always been super nice! The staff and vibe is what makes this place worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Went here with some friends for some drinks & gub on a Saturday afternoon. I like the layout of the place - and we were even able to watch some college football which was a nice bonus.  For food we ordered some tacos - chicken, beef & duck carnitas. DELICIOUS! In fact we had to order more because the hubs at mine and I wasn't about to miss out on any of the goodness.  Also, they DO sell boxes of wine for $30... so of course we ordered one. Other than the horrific hangover the next day, it was definitely a great time. I haven't been at night, seeing as how I'm old and can barely stay awake past 10pm, but I've heard from friends that it's a good time. Maybe one crazy night I'll stay out late enough to give it a shot..."}
{"text":"Came in here during our Spring Training trip and this place was NUTS! El Hefe is like a weird corner of Vegas mashed up with a bar in Old Town. The place felt like a crazy house party inside of a bar, with everybody going wild the entire time. Nothing negative to say about this place-great place to check out if you're in town for Spring Training and looking to get weird. Will definitely be back next year!"}
{"text":"What a fun place! Had a great time. Had a beer garita and carne asade and chicken rings tacos. Great food."}
{"text":"After a bartender decided to tip himself out extra we got a hold of a manager who was the antitheses of the bartender.  The manager was very professional and helpful. Resolved the problem for us right away. ---------- Save all your credit card receipts! I was out last weekend and checked my credit card statement and they added an extra ten dollars to my bill!  I've tried to call the restaurant but the machine gives store hours and then the abruptly disconnects.  Beware!"}
{"text":"Place was dope. I like their tacos.  The bus service is really nice so that i can get there and back without having to drive. I like getting drunk there"}
{"text":"El Hefe is a blast and Taco Tuesday is always awesome: the $2 tacos & $3 Dos Equis are totally the way to go but you can never go wrong with margaritas. Lunch the couple times I have had it has always been good and pretty fast, but I can't say I've ever tried having dinner here. Since this is a bar my primary experience here has been bar hopping. I'm not sure why everyone seems to be complaining about drunk people and crowds- this is a BAR in downtown Tempe...last time I checked isn't that what people are looking for when they go to a bar at night? People watching is always a blast here-if I wanted a place to myself I could always stay home. Sundays aren't my drinking scene anymore (I'm getting old (26) so I recover slower...) but if it's yours the party starting at 4 is probably for you! Definitely a fun place to hang out!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out if town and I was told that THIS was the place to grab tacos. I was lucky enough to get Amy as a bartender and she made me a custom margarita and took my food order. Tacos came up in about 5 minutes and did not disappoint. Glad we made this stop!"}
{"text":"Customer service here is the worst! My girlfriend's and i came here for a few drinks and the bartender Alyssa was very rude and condescending. Very bad service !!"}
{"text":"We came here with high hopes but were highly disappointed. The service was horrible (our waitress would disappear for long periods of time and would ask is what we ordered several times), the margaritas seemed watered down (house and Cadillac) and our tacos were less than desired (in fact 2 of them were cold). The shrimp taco was by far the weirdest taco I've ever eaten! We saw others order the fajitas and those looked much better....maybe I'll try that next time.   We are going to try the Tempe location in the future to see if that's any better."}
{"text":"Nice, fun place. The portions are small but are tastefully decorated and are delicious. The service was quick and the servers were very courteous"}
{"text":"I really love the tacos here....which is the only reason why I ever come here. BUT, they just removed the duck taco from their menu. I have no idea why they would do this, because it was one of the best tacos I've ever had. Their margaritas are decent, especially when it is happy hour. I like coming here with my dog because he is allowed outside on their patio and they are pretty good about bringing him a bowl of water.  The other complaint I might have about this place is that their music is so ridiculously loud, I understand it is a bar, but when the place is empty in the afternoon their is no reason to still be blasting the music like it is a club.  Also having a hostess seat you is pretty hit or miss, I've stood their waiting for a good 5-10 minutes before someone ever came to seat me.  And on other occasions when I've just gone to seat myself because I got tired of waiting they seem to get annoyed."}
{"text":"Didn't realize El Hefe has an absolutely ridiculous dress code regarding Jordans.  As my friends/family waited in line,  security came up to my cousin and advised  him he wouldn't be able to go in due to his \"basketball shoes\"...I then stated to him they are Jordans. He then looked at me and asked if I knew who Michael Jordan was and said he played basketbal haha and said they were \"basket ball shoes\" therefore he wouldn't be able to let my cousin in and was saving us some time NOT to wait in line..... I didn't see any strictly enforced dress code on El Hefe website regarding Jordans. It's absolutely crazy to turn down any man just because they are wearing a great brand of shoes.  I definitely wouldn't bother referring anyone to El Hefe Tempe."}
{"text":"The location is perfect, the staff was amazing and friendly.  Came from out of town and will be back!  The management team is awesome and was very attentive and showed us that Arizona very hospitable and a great place to spend a spring break trip.  The management staff should win an award for the best service ever.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service,  they did not greet us at the door, workers just stared at you, waitresses take forever to take your order and they have a snobby attitude. Food was ok however, just needs a lil more spice! Not going back."}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give this place half a star!!  The food was over priced and disgusting. We should have went to Taco Bell or Filibertos.  There were COCKROACHES crawling all over the walls and booths. We complained to an employee who did nothing to resolve the situation or even try and kill the cockroaches,  he just let them continue crawling around the walls and booths!!  I'm absolutely disgusted and will never ever return to this establishment.  This place needs to be cleaned!! The booth we sat in had left over food in it!!  So gross!!"}
{"text":"Definitely what you would expect from an El Hefe so close to ASU's campus : the waitresses and bartenders are all hot and all can dance. The food is a great modern Mexican taste and the presentations is beautiful.   This location is much larger than the Scottsdale one and has a lot of patio space. There are 3 bars, 1 inside, 1 on the back patio and 1 on the front patio. The dining room is large and by night it is filled with people dancing to who ever is dj'ing that night.   On their busy nights you can expect a line, but if you're trying to get into one of the more popular places, you should expect that.  The music is always fun and the crowd is always energetic.   The staff is very friendly and always seem like they are having fun.    Overall a great place by day or by night. Who knows you might find your future ex here."}
{"text":"Love this place! Foods awesome, the staff is fun, and the atmosphere is contagious. You can't walk out of here without a smile.   The food is a brilliant take on classic Mexican food and looks as good as it tastes. They have about a million tequilas and a million more margarita combinations.   Located right in the heart of old town Scottsdale this place lives up to the hype. Beautiful women run wild in this place, However with that come the occasional tatted meat head but those guys are cool too (sometimes). The line moves fairly quickly as does the pace of the night. This place is usually pretty busy and always fun."}
{"text":"Fun music and lots of people. Me and a friend were just talking to a security guard and a girl who didn't like my friend threw a drink at her and kicked her in the back. When we said \"are you gonna do anything ???\" He said \"I believe that was an accident....\" Left right after, I'm insulted and will never go here for lunch or a night out ever again."}
{"text":"I would recommend this place to anyone trying to have a good time on a friday night. They play the best music here. All the bartenders are really friendly"}
{"text":"I love el hefe! They have the best happy hour in old town and on Tuesdays all Of they're tacos are $2 not to mention that they're absolutely to die for!"}
{"text":"Drinks are fairly priced and the waitresses are super nice! I don't eat when I come, because I'm here for the drinks :) I def recommend the place for a fun time! Casual atmosphere so come on down"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. My boyfriend and I went there at the end of December and the experience wasn't too bad until the waitress basically stole from us. When our bill came for $59, I contributed $20 in cash and my boyfriend put the rest on his card. The receipt he signed and authorized said $39 (balance after the cash was supposedly applied). A couple days later he checks his statement and he was charged the full amount! The waitress just pocketed the cash! When he called to try and resolve this he kept being told to call back for a manager (no one bothered to take his info down and call him back either). It is 2 months later, no word form a manager and still no refund. Despicable."}
{"text":"My friend did not get into El Hefe tonight because his jeans were \"too baggy\" which 2 out of the 3 bouncers disagreed with. However, because he was a big guy the one bouncer would not let him in. It's ridiculous...just because one bouncer makes a decision doesn't mean all the bouncers could make a group decision."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Walked in when the patio was empty. Asked for a table for 2. Advised of a 20 minute wait based on reservations. 45 minutes later we still had no table and the patio was empty."}
{"text":"It is a nice bar, the taco is very cheap and quite tasty. I remembered My friend ordered whiskey for me, it is awesome .."}
{"text":"Worst place ever!  I don't think they like people of color in there because the bouncers will do their best to come up with excuses not to let them in. I saw it happen in front of me and then it happened to me."}
{"text":"If it's a Wednesday evening or a Sunday day.. This is where you want to be! The party is great. The food is fresh!"}
{"text":"Service was slow waitress got our order wrong ,she never wrote anything down and the food is not great they did not take off the mistakes the waitress made from our bill and just a FYI the groupon is not good at the Tempe location ."}
{"text":"Don't skip El Hefe for lunch. Tacos are amazing as always and they even have new taco varieties. The new ceviche is phenomenal and I don't usually like ceviche. Taco Tuesday is the best. You can literally try every taco on the menu for $2 each. Can't beat that."}
{"text":"Some of the worst tacos I ever had.  They were cold and the meat was mushy, watery, and soggy like it had been previously frozen and been sitting in a slow cooker.  Also service was slow.  The Elote dip was okay but I will never come back here again."}
{"text":"El hefe not only has some of the best food around, but it is the only place in Tempe to party when there are games, going out, or during the day!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was a good experience...our server haylee was great! two $ tacos on Tuesday best thing ever."}
{"text":"Last night decided to go for our brother's birthday and the Asian guy at the door was rude to us from the gate. First of all, we aren't the typical college crowd age and were there just to have a drink. We were dressed appropriate to begin with but when he tells us that they have a very strict dress code and one of the guy's pants was too baggy (which was the birthday boy) we thought he was joking because there were guys in there with flip flops, skin tight pants, and man capris?!?! Uhhh, its not so strict if guys in there look like they are at the beach and about a centimeter close from having a male camel toe!!!!!!!!! So we kinda laughed when he said we couldn't go in thinking he was being sarcastic, but his rude and dry attitude  quickly had as laughing at him because he made himself look like a complete jack ass and permanently gave the establishment a bad name. Find bouncers that are more personable and with real judgment of what an actual dress code is."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with some coworkers and the food is amazing!  Modern Mexican food.  Get the ceviche tostadas - best thing we had and we tried a lot of different items.  The green chile burger was another favorite.  Any of the street tacos will not disappoint - my personal fav is the Pork Al Pastor.  Margaritas are awesome too with fresh muddled ingredients.  The cucumber marg and the jalapeño mint marg were the best."}
{"text":"Another great meal at el heffe. Mahi mahi tacos are very good. Our server Andrea explained the menu very well. Manager Austin came over and made sure everything was fine. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm guessing we're not the demographic for this restaurant. It's super loud -- thanks mostly to the music- even though it's a Sunday afternoon. The number of times someone in my party has had to say \"what?\"is astronomical.  The chips/salsa is tasty but the houses margaritas are incredibly weak/watered down. The staff has been very nice, but that's not enough to get us to stay. After drinks/appetizers, we're heading somewhere else for dinner.   I'm sure the usual crowd on Mill St enjoys this locale but it's not for me."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Especially the tacos. We went for Taco Tuesday, so the tacos were all $2, but would otherwise be $3-$5 dollars each which is an expensive taco, if you ask me. The chips and salsa were good too. The service needed some improvement because there was only one guy working his butt off and our waitress was nowhere to be found, but the food was worth it."}
{"text":"Went here last night waited at the entrance to be seated as the sign said. Waited about 5 minutes before being acknowledged should have been a sign to leave. When someone came to help was told it was open seating. Sat outside again waited a long time for service.  Lack of interest from all staff. Toilets weren't clean and no paper in any of the 5 restrooms. Asked to speak to a manager and told he wasn't on site. Been here a few times. Seems the place is going downhill fast. Food tends to be cold regularly"}
{"text":"Tacos are AWESOME love it! Drinks are pretty good ! I'll be back !"}
{"text":"We are in town for a wedding this weekend and randomly stopped in El Hefe Tempe. AMAZING margs and phenomenal service! Brittany is the best! Order the Salty Chihuahua, make sure to get the guac and ask for Brittany!"}
{"text":"This place by far has the rudest employees I have seen in a long time! So unhelpful, made it seem like I was such an inconvenience when asking a simple question.. I first called multiple times and the phone just rang continuously, so I made the drive down there from glendale and asked to speak to a manager and she was busy! Yes that's what the gentleman told me! I will never be back there!! I will also spread the word of how terrible their customer service is! If you do not like working in that industry find a new job!"}
{"text":"WOW! This place rocks! Great atmosphere....Fun....Servers are energetic, courteous & always go the extra mile for you...Our drinks & food came promptly to our table...,.Drinks and food are off the chain! If your looking for an atmosphere of high energy, fun, variety of drinks, food & of course the best servers on the planet then El Hefe's on Mill St in Tempe is the place to be!"}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and thought this looked like a good place to sit at the bar and enjoy a game on TV and the outdoors. I was by myself. There were three bartenders, and it was after six minutes that the younger gal, DeeDee, came to attend me. Great gal and she really tried to make things right. BUT alas she's young and really doesn't have the experience to work the bar. Total people at the bar was 15, enough for three bartenders to keep us happy, but not so much when there is only one   First - all three bartenders made drinks and the drink area was dirty. They never washed their hands even when handling food or after handling dirty dishes. Only the male bartender had a bar towel. He never used it. All straws were picked up and shoved into a drink by handling the tip of the straw.   Second - the other female bartender, would just walk around and thrill her hair. Even when my drink was empty and DeeDee was busy, she just looked at it and walked by. I had made the decision to only have another one if I was asked. She continued to talk about her legal problems to two guys, who were interested in her more than making a purchase. And they drank water! They spent no money. And no neither was her attorney, trust me. I have no idea who the male bartender was tending to.  Third - the male bartender was going to pour two shots of Patron, but before pouring it put the glasses in the drinking ice to chill. When that wasn't working fast enough, he had a great thought to stick the whole bottle in the ice to chill the bottle. The bottle that had been sitting on the dirty drink area. Hey there dude, IT\"S drinking ice!!   Fourth - dishes were dirty. Poor DeeDee had to get me other plates. The gentlemen sitting next to me said the same thing. I couldn't stomach the food and ordered the chips and salsa which were $3. Really?!?!?! I know this is probably a corporate thing, but REALLY corporate?   Finally, for being a Mexican bar and bragging on their good margaritas, even the top shelf was awful. Too sweet! The people next to me suggested trying the skinny since it was pure alcohol, but by then I was ready to move on to have a night cap elsewhere.   Hopefully they get their problems fixed, but I'm sure the atmosphere keeps people coming."}
{"text":"Well let's just say never again. Never will I go nor will I recommend this place. Just went to the hostess to get a table, young Asian girl states the bar is open seating but as you can see its full. No problem I say what about a table? On no we have a wait list for that and I can't give you a time....WHAT? She doesn't know when a table will be available. That's funny there is absolutely no one waiting and she states there is a waiting list. She then says you can go somewhere else if you want too...WHAT you have to be kidding me. I guess customer service is not what it's all about at this establishment. Not good considering I can walk here from my house."}
{"text":"Came to get some drinks on a Thursday afternoon.  Service was good.  Good atmosphere.  Our waitress hooked it up."}
{"text":"Hate to do it but sorry this place is gross.  So crazy dirty and service was comical."}
{"text":"Excellent food, drinks, and service. It was definitely a culinary experience for me, and I tried food I have never had before. It was fun to hang out there with friends and they had live music on a floating stage above the bar! The vibe there is different from any other place in Scottsdale- very welcoming and relaxed! We cannot wait to go there again and try some more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Had lunch here on our way to the airport headed back home. The service was great and the food was delish (all of us had various tacos). We had a yelp offer for an order of free chips and guac. There was a delay in bringing the chips and guac out to us, so they comped our drinks (1 margarita and an iced tea). We didn't complain, just merely reminded them we hadn't gotten the chips/guac. They nicely took the beverages off our bill. A very generous gesture and certainly not necessary, but shows that excellent customer service is important to them. I would highly recommend El Hefe."}
{"text":"I was standing in line next to a gentleman who had waited a very long time to get into el hefe. He was very polite, well dressed and well mannered. When it came time to show I.d to get in he was denied entry because of his neck tattoo. I saw the tattoo myself and wondered what they had against a colorful butterfly? I could understand if it was offensive or gang related but s butterfly??? Cmon! I myself was so disgusted at the ignorance and prejudice of the establishment as well as the way they handled the situation that I myself stepped out of line and decided not to give my business to el hefe. I know a large amount of people that visit el hefe on the regular and I will be more than happy to deter anyone I know from ever visiting again. Get it together guys."}
{"text":"Bartenders dressed in Native American costumes on Thanksgiving is completely offensive and ignorant I cannot believe a company would allow this."}
{"text":"Amy was super and all the staff were friendly and on top of things. The manager is lucky to have this team. And enjoyed the food and beer too. Great location. Good outdoor and indoor seating options too."}
{"text":"Just left El Jeff in tempe.  Three of us ready to have a great Sunday.  Upon entering there was no employee in sight.  There were 4 people  seated at the bar.  We sat at a booth for approximately 3 minutes before a young lady appeared who was the bartender.  She made eye contact with me as she walked to the bar.   She proceeded to just talk to people at the bar and drink her bottled water.  A young man came out from the back passed by us twice with no acknowledgement, but was extremely friendly with 2 guys at the bar.  We have been in this industry, combined, for over 30 years.  We wanted to spend $$ at your establishment and would have tipped accordingly.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"If you're coming straight from a pool party at the W, already wasted, and looking for a packed Sunday Funday, El Hefe is the place to go. That being said, it seems like business is already being lost with the openings of newer nearby clubs like Hifi and Maya. Have been here for lunch, happy hour, and many times for Sunday Funday and tables on weekends. The service is terrible no matter what time you go. Last time I was there the bartender poured my drinks, about 15 minutes after I ordered them, then set them on the bar where they were immediatly knocked over by a drunk patron. I was told that I still had to pay the over $30 tab and wouldn't get any replacement drinks. I understand that the bartenders might get overwhelmed when it's packed, but the service is just as bad during lunch when its practically empty. Our server looked annoyed, probably because she had to work a lunch shift instead of a busy night shift. My friend and I were literally the only people there besides a lone guy drinking at the bar, but she still took over 20 minutes to get our drink orders. Food was just OK. I prefer the tacos at pretty much every other similar Mexican restaurant in Old Town. I doubt I would ever come back for more than guacamole, chips, and drinks in terms of food. The beergarita drink (huge marg with a mini corona in it) is great. Expensive but definitley worth it. In terms of bottle service, their concept of offering a keg with a tap at the table is unique, and every guy I've ever been there with loves it. Service again was awful, despite our group spending on 2 bottles, a keg, and multiple shots. The server drank from our tap and constantly was jumping up on our table, literally pushing the girls in our group out of the way, so she could dance and blow her annoying whistle in our faces. We still had a great time, the music and overall atmosphere is great if you're looking to party, but for paying that much money I would expect to be served by my server, not treated like this was her table and we were just the bottle rats infringing on it. I definitley would not recommend to anyone who is not into/used to the Scottsdale club scene. If you're looking for a bar you can talk to your friends in, easily move around, etc (which we weren't, we came for the party scene), then Hefe is not your spot. But for striclty a drunken good time, would recommend. I just probably wouldn't waste money on the bottle service. Take your business elsewhere for that"}
{"text":"It's tucked away, but worth the search. The decor is very fun. The plastic covers on the booths are what you would expect to find in a Hispanic grandma's house. The chips and salsa are some of the best I've had. The first time we went, the hubs and I tried a bit of everything: nearly every taco and a torta. The most recent visit, we grabbed a taco and split a pork belly torta. If it's a first time, you gotta try the pork belly empanadas and chicken tinga. The table taps are really cool and, if I hadn't had my 3 mo old son with me, I would have had a beer. The only downside were the churros. The sauces were great and would have complimented the churros perfectly had the churros been cooked all the way through. I think the oil was too hot and crisped up the outside before the center was cooked. Even at that, definitely will return. Can't wait to try some nachos."}
{"text":"Got the free chips and guacamole through yelp and it was so yummy that I wanted more chips and dip...so we ordered the queso and salsa too.  All yummy!  The steak fajitas were delicious and the staff was wonderful.  The Cadillac margarita went down and my husband really liked the salty chihuahua margarita.  We finished things off with free shots from the manager.  Success for this old married couple's date night!"}
{"text":"fun place, but dont do the bottle service! i have been there 5 times with bottle service & its not worth it! the server will come by & make drinks from the bottle, but not ask if anyone wants anything else, never suggests shots & is pretty much nonexistent. they sell the table out from under you if dont immediately order more bottles. once they sell your table (before talking to you)  they become exceptionally rude not just the waitress but management as well! also, check your bill closewly they will try and charge ypu for things that were supposedly included! i love el hefe but avoid bottle service at all cost!!!!"}
{"text":"We came here while exploring Scottsdale to satiate a sudden urge for churros. And what a fun place!  The bar was super busy and we decided to get a drink while waiting for our churros, since it seemed like a fun place to hang out on a Sunday evening. I ordered the Margarita, it was plenty to keep me going for the rest of my stay at El Hefe and tasted delicious.   The Churros was simply delicious, came with three dipping sauces, Chocolate Ganache, Coconut and Dulche De Leche. The presentation was fantastic and it was the most memorable & delicious churros experience I've had in my life. The Horchata milk shake that came with the churros was delectable and addictive. I wonder why we didn't get a round two of the churros."}
{"text":"This place is terrible.  Service took forever, manager was a jerk, and security was a bunch of meatheads that thought they were awesome for being 30 and working at a bar.  Cool story bro, get a real job."}
{"text":"Great food experience with just a few service bumps.  Came here for a quick lunch w/ 5 guys and 4 of us ordered the Tres Tacos Especial. At $11 it offered great value for a choice of 3 impressive sounding tacos and 1 side (Street corn for me).   While not a huge deal, a few bumps in the service lead me to drop the 4th star and give a 3. A mix up of 2 taco orders occurred (but was rectified in a timely manner). It wasn't until I began eating my tacos that I realized that mine was mixed up too (I should have caught it earlier, nevertheless, all the tacos were great).   Considering the simplicity of what we ordered I thought it would have been nice if the server just automatically split our bill. Whatever...she didn't, but when the bill came all 4 taco especials came up as $12. I know $4 isn't much to complain about...but it says $11 on the menu. I mentioned it to the server and (in a friendly manner) she returned with a new bill. But all she did was give a discount to rectify the discrepancy...but the discount was only for $3...still charging that extra $1 for the 4th meal. Again...the money is not the issue, just the principle.  Other than that...a great place to grab some food!"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch was a blast at el hefe. Food was excellent but we had to wait a long time for drinks and our check and it was not busy.  We will be back but hopefully to find faster service."}
{"text":"Great tacos and specials. Krislyn is super helpful bartender!  Haven't tried their other food yet so can't comment. The space is beautiful and well located. Very pleasant."}
{"text":"Guess you need to be white to be served here. Practice customer service cause it sucks badly."}
{"text":"Cute server, well presented Patron shots, and solid happy hour. Asada, Shrimp, and Carnitas tacos all delicious. Corona came cold as well as the tequila. Come early to beat the crowds, yoga bunnies, and bros."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible bar service! We ordered 4 tacos on \"Taco Tuesday\" plus drinks. After an hour of no tacos and tempermental bar service we had to call the manager. My husband tried to signal and call the bartender over and she completely ignored us. All other customers were being served promptly and had their food and drinks earlier than we did. A big fat NO to customer service. We are completely disappointed with this place that's supposed to be a professional establishment. But then again, the class is for college students and younger working adults that don't expect much right now. I would not recommend this place. Walk by and head to the small taco shop around the corner or the other 10 places around."}
{"text":"This place was awesome and the food was yummy!!! The staff was friendly and the place looks pretty cool. I would recommend this place and give it two thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"I can't speak for the food, but I went on a Saturday and it was PACKED. There were some cool things in the midst of the chaos, like a photo booth and a confetti stream every so often. It's not necessarily their fault that the place gets so busy, but even elevating the bar a bit and adding some separation from the dance floor could be beneficial. It took me like 10 minutes to get to the bar from the center of the room, like another 10 just to flag down a bartender, and then I had to wait another 10 just for my drink to come. It's not unheard of, but if I can go anywhere else on Mill, walk up to the bar and order my drink in like 5 minutes, then 30 seems counter-intuitive to having a good time there."}
{"text":"Hefe is the place to be for taco Tuesday. Great customer service and food. The manager Parker was absolutely amazing! 10/10"}
{"text":"I ordered one of theIR \"20 oz margaritas\" and watched him shake it in a 10-12 oz cup, poor it in the glass, and then he filled the rest with sweet and sour and ice. What's the point? I would rather have a 12 oz margarita as long as it doesn't taste like straight mix. On top of this, their promoters are terrible.. Get it together hefe or the crowd you want will stay at gringo"}
{"text":"Extremely crowded, bartenders (girls) are so rude, they judge thr kind of drink you order and throw your money at you. They are super conceited and need tl realize how low they really are... Begging for tips in those shorts! Never coming back here!"}
{"text":"After waiting in line for about 30 minutes (no big deal), and having about 6 groups of people pulled out of line because they knew someone working there (annoying), we finally got in and were met by some of the worst bartenders I've ever experienced. We waited patiently for someone, it was saturday night and the place was packed, and one of the girls actually stopped serving drinks and spent the next 5 minutes dancing with the other bartender, leaving no drinks coming out while about 10 of us waited. Couldn't get a jack and coke right, first one was all coke, 2nd was all jack, gave up on a third attempt and just had a beer. I will say the place was loud amd rockin', and that's why we went there. Excellent atmosphere, and a big crowd if thats what you're into, but we came to drink and that was a disappointment."}
{"text":"The atmosphere on this Sunday was explosive. The staff was extremely accommodating, and constantly checked to see if needed anything, including the security. My waitress Kennedy was very engaging and energetic. I forgot to inform them of my food allergy and when the food arrived they insisted on replacing it. Overall a fantastic experience. It seems they worked on their synergy."}
{"text":"I'm going to review this place in a couple settings.  For taco tuesday, this place has the best offerings and varieties of tacos and margaritas. Each taco is tender and juicy without skimping on the serving of protein. The carne asada are my favorite out of the list.   On a night on, this place can get busy. Lots of guys largely due to the good music, attractive staff dancing on counters and overall nightlife appeal. The service and waiting for a drink is really good. The bartenders in general are attentive.  Good for tacos and good for nightlife. Pick what works for you."}
{"text":"El Hefe is one of my favorite spots... whether it's a packed Saturday night or a laid back Tuesday evening. Either way, it's always a good time! Their churros are unreal. They are cooked to perfection and come with 3 different dipping sauces. Their tacos are bomb too! And let's talk about the drinks... the beer-garita is awesome. Margartia + Corona? Genius. And the fact that you can pour your own beer at the tables using taps is pretty kickass in my book too. Overall, my go to spot in Old Town!"}
{"text":"Sam was an AMAZING waitress! Can't wait to come back & see her :) We had the mamacita & the chips & fried avocado taco .... Delicious! Plus the manager shots topped off our afternoon.  Great atmosphere"}
{"text":"As a die-hard Canteen lover, I was super bummed when El Hefe took over. However, as the space is practically EXACTLY the same (aside from the unnecessarily outstretched front patio), I thought I would be nice and check it out...I can tell you now, it was a waste of time. We arrived early -before 10- on a Friday night and already, was off to a terrible start. The bouncer gave my friend the most condescending up-and-down and said, very rudely \"JUST SO YOU KNOW for next time, we don't allow Jordans in here\". Keep in mind, my friend, who is white, was dressed casually in nice, dark jeans, a button down shirt and Jordans. No basketball gear is allowed. Yet once we got inside, every tv had a basketball game on. How ironic. Already offended, we went to get drinks. We literally had a bartender look us in the eye, smile and then leave from behind the bar. You would think she'd WANT to take our money. I guess not. It would have been faster to send a carrier pigeon to Germany to get our drinks. Other irritating things that happened: -we were told the back patio was closed and came inside as we were asked, only to find 10 minutes later another group was out there and wasn't bothered at all -a manager rudely swept me to the side with his arm as he led a group of toolbags to their table. no one else was around. a nice \"excuse me\" would have worked just fine. For a fairly new bar on Mill, all in all it was an extremely disappointing experience. If you want to hang out with an excessive amount of douche bags, wait forever for overpriced drinks, be belittled by the staff, pretend to dance to outdated remixes and have an all around miserable night, then El Hefe is definitely the place to be. I haven't seen many positive reviews, so I don't feel bad saying I will not be returning to this bar."}
{"text":"I actually really like this bar a lot!  It's your typical fratty bar... but ... you're in Arizona so there's honestly not a LOT of \"fratty/southern\" type of bars outside of Mill Avenue.  They have an El Hefe in Scottsdale too, and while I like that one... it doesn't have the \"fratty/southern\" feel that THIS LOCATION has!  I actually went to a mixer here and it was everything I'd expect it to be lol  THUS, the only downside is it can get incredibly packed as it's typically the \"go to\" for \"fratty/southern\" bars in the Phoenix metro as there are not a whole lot of them honestly(I'm just being real).    Definitely worth the wait and the 5 stars...and they should continue to be selective on who they let in!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite stops when going to Mill. Not a big fan of the food but when it comes to a girls night out this is definitely one of my favorites! The music is great and the crowds always pumped!"}
{"text":"This place sukkkkssssss One star only !! Friday night long day and week, I get home, put my and1 shorts and tanktop. 20 min I'm on mill. my buddy had cigar that he wanted to smoke. walked to El jefe and the security guy won't let me Inn bcoz my shorts. so I guess if you one of the thousand peeps that hangout with shorts and a tank AVOID THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"I was excited to have El Hefe open on Mill since it's closer to my house than the Scottsdale location and I love their margaritas.  I was extremely disappointed with the service, I didn't expect it to be fantastic but thought it would at least be decent.   I gave this place 2 tries, my first visit was the 2nd week it was open.  My boyfriend and I sat at the bar near the front patio, we tried to order a few of the margaritas and the bartender told us she didn't have the ingredients to make those.  We asked what she could make us, she said 'pretty much just a regular margarita.'  The main bar is about 10 steps away, I was thinking she would at least either get ingredients from them to make the drinks, or have them make it and she would bring it over.  After going with the regular margaritas the bartender had the ingredients for, we finished and wanted to ordered a bottled beer.  The bartender explained she didn't have the beer we wanted at this bar.  I guess she didn't want to go get the bottles from the other bar or stock her bar properly so she could be prepared for customers.  We ended up closing the tab and leaving.    The scottsdale location has a side bar as well kinda in the back, and that bar always seems to be stocked to make all the margaritas and more from the menu.  That being said, I was kinda shocked with the laziness of this bartender, especially since we were 2 of the 4 people at the bar.    My 2nd visit was Valentines day 2014.  My boyfriend and I went to get a drink at El Hefe before dinner since the basketball game was on.  We went to the main bar this time and waited in plane view for about 10-15 minutes to be asked for our order.  As I was standing there, I noticed the bartenders were not taking anyones order from the bar, they were mainly paying attention to the tickets coming in from the restaurant.  I found this weird, especially since people at the bar were trying to order drinks but couldn't get the attention from the bartenders.  I got to order drinks and after they were made they were very good.  We finished the first drinks and my bf ordered another of the same drink, this time his drink tasted NOTHING like the previous one, it was kind of gross like it was missing a main ingredient.  After he paid for that drink, a few minutes later he noticed he didn't get his card back so he told the bartender.  The bartender asked for his last name as if he was going to look for the card and instead proceeded to go to the next customer and take a drink order ...I waited after he made the new customer their drink, to see if he would look for the card, he didn't he just proceeded to make more drinks.  We flagged down another bartender who made the awful drink to look behind the bar for the card, she did a real swift look and didn't come back to tell us if she found or didn't find the card. INSTEAD, she proceeded to take her purse and leave the bar,i guess to go on her break. WOW! We had planned to go to dinner afterwards and my bf was going to buy.  Turns out he couldn't buy or go to dinner if he didn't have his card.  So I went to the hostess this time, she took down all my information and i asked her to go look behind the bar.  I told her I know its there and we need to go to dinner but can't without my boyfriends card.  She seemed sincere and i watched her go up to the first bartender we tried to get help from.  They exchanged some words and he just continued making drinks for the tickets from the restaurant instead of even attempting to look for my bf's card.     We ended up leaving and going home since we were getting no where with the El Hefe staff and didn't have card to pay for dinner.  (If I was aware this was going to happen I would have brought money so we could go to dinner, but I didn't plan for El Hefe's staff to be completely rude and incompetent of helping a customer).  The next morning my boyfriend calls El Hefe when they opened and asked if they had his card.  What do you know...they had his card and it was BEHIND THE BAR THE WHOLE TIME! Thank you to the El Hefe staff for not even bothering to look for my boyfriends card on Valentine's day.  Thank you for ruining Valentine's Day night that was supposed to be fun and simple.  Instead it was shocking and put us in a bad mood because the El hefe staff refused to help with such a SIMPLE task.   I don't think there will be a 3rd visit."}
{"text":"This place just wasn't for me. I heard about it on the radio or something. The food was not good at all and the place just kind of dirty. I recommend this place to men... Stay away ladies."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff! Amazing margaritas and prices are reasonable. A must try!"}
{"text":"We had our office Holiday Party at El Hefe and it was amazing! Eric, the GM and his staff went above and beyond to take care of our group and make sure that everything was perfect!  I work remotely out of our California office, and had the task of planning this event. Not being from the area (Scottsdale) or knowing too much about it, I thought this would be an incredibly hard task but it turned out to be one of the easiest events I have ever planned. Eric and his team took care of all the set up, menu choices, entertainment, etc. All I had to do was tell them what I was looking for and they took care of the rest! The vibe of the restaurant was young and hip, which was exactly what we wanted for our party. We will for sure be back in the future!"}
{"text":"We had a fun time however I ordered tacos and they never came and our server even told me that they were on there way twice but they never came   They ran out of coors light miller light and dos and then still charged for premium buckets they just never seemed interested in making our experience worth it"}
{"text":"We came to Scottsdale for my sister's Bachelorette party weekend. We ended up eating at El Hefe. I had the carne asada and thought it was really good!! The atmosphere was fun and we had a great server! After eating we went back to our hotel to get ready for the night and decided to return for the rest of the night. There was no line to wait in because I think we got there early enough. We saw the server that waited on us earlier at dinner and she hooked us up with a Bachelor party that had a table. The music was great. There really wasn't any part of the night that was a bad experience. When we go back to Scottsdale we will definitely go to El Hefe."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Came in at 5pm to watch the playoff hockey game. It was basically empty. We asked the bartender to change one of the tvs to the game and they changed it to the wrong channel. Asked them again and nothing for about 10 min. At this point we decided to go to a bar on mill that actually knew what they were doing. Waited another 5 - 10 min with my card in my hand to pay out while 5 employees just stood around the bar doing nothing. I know they get busy at night and turn into more of a club but it's a miracle they capture any business at all during the day with that type of service. Stay far away."}
{"text":"I like the vibe at el hefe and their tacos were on point. Their house margaritas were totally worth the five bucks during their happy hour as well.  The service was very good and quick and I planning on going back soon."}
{"text":"Went for lunch which I'm certain is a totally different experience than at night. The space is nice and has a very indoor/outdoor feel due to the large garage style doors. Service was fine and food was good. Not great but not bad. The descriptions on the menu were vastly different than what was actually served and we were surprised by that. The quesadillas were much more taco like than quesadilla like. The pollo torta had some sort of ground beef or chorizo or something on it which wasn't mentioned on the menu at all and the churros were not stuffed as described and didn't come with a side of ice cream as mentioned on the menu. I know this place is new and they're still probably trying to work out the kinks but really the menus should be reprinted to represent the food. It's also pretty pricey for what you get. I would go back for happy hour or something but don't think I'll be back for lunch."}
{"text":"At first my feelings for El Hefe were love/hate. Mainly because I couldn't understand why they built this place to be so freaking SMALL with such a MASSIVE bar... sort of a stupid design plan. Not even a dance floor was included when they built this place yet they managed to add TWO bars.  I would only go to Hefe when I was getting a table or if someone in the group knew a bartender. But after being dragged in all summer, I warmed up to it. It is still not my favorite but I do love the concept and the wall decor.   I would suggest if you plan on coming here on Friday or Saturday, get a table. The money is worth it unless you plan on spending half your night just trying to bob and weave through a sardine can filled with people."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday great prices, great selection, great service. Waited a bit for a table but it's worth the wait. Outdoor seating has great views of Mill."}
{"text":"Don't recommend the food.... Very disappointing. Cool place but for drinks only. Chips were stale, guacamole wasn't good, and tacos were cold and not exciting. There a lot better places for tacos. Service was ok... Slow and our server wasn't very knowledgable about the food."}
{"text":"This place is just epic fun.  If you're ready to dance, party, meet strangers and let go -- roll through here.  Every night it seems like the life of the party and yes, it's going to be super packed."}
{"text":"This place used to be great. Went for late lunch. Slow service, pretentious bar tenders (wow you make $60K, gee you so rich!) and a bit outdated.   Walked out after 5 min..  this place won't get my money, nope.  Looks like management cares enough to respond and contact me. Manager Erik provided his cell and I will call him. I used to like El Jefe and want them to succeed. More to come.."}
{"text":"Deffinetly the spot to be we had an amazing time celebrating my girlfriends birthday here. The staff was extremely friendly and even though it was slammed the service was great. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and each time has been completely different.  First time:   My friend I watched the football game - it was kinda quiet and our server was brand new. She didn't really know what beers were on offer or what kind of food was being served. I wouldn't've done any better, so I can sympathise with someone in her position. No draft beers were being sold, so we stuck with bottles and and ordered Chips and 4 tacos. I had no complaints  Second time:  4 of us were watching another football game in a booth - The first server was nice and did what was expected. Draft beers were being sold this time, and the food was as expected for the price we paid. We then moved outside and got a new server. Ordered a Bloody Mary and did not receive my Bacon and Celery, as advertised. The server said it doesn't come with these 2 food items (but their menu states it does). The propane was out and they had no reserves.. We left shortly after this  Third time:  Disaster! - Again, we went to watch a football game. It was a nice day and very busy. Again, we were told they were not serving draft beer (what bar doesn't serve draft!). I ordered that beer/ margarita thing and it just tasted of the margarita mix.. We ordered Chips at the very beginning only to see new people sitting down get theirs before us. We ordered food, but this took forever, so the server spoke to her manager who immediately came over to apologise. The food was cancelled and we were given a round of shots for our troubles.  The manager, Brittany Flippen, gave me her business card and said to contact her should we have any concerns.  The whole experience didn't really phase me too much. I understand its a new place experiencing teething issues along with new servers. They should close down until all issues are rectified or continue to push customers away with sub-par service.  I'll probably go back again, but I'll call ahead this time to make sure everything is in order"}
{"text":"This place has HORRIBLE damn service ... wow , And they fucked up on my order and the best part about is the server tried saying how busy they were lol.. there are empty seats everywhere"}
{"text":"I have been coming to El Hefe Tempe almost since it opened. The management has always been great and I have had good service from many of the staff who have come, gone, and even come back. The food is good and lately one bartender, Emily,  has stood out with her service. She always make you feel welcome and is quick to get you your drinks. Even when all the bar seats are full she makes sure you are taken care of. I've not only witnessed this toward myself but also to other customers. This place is always worth the visit. More reviews coming in the future."}
{"text":"Dropped in today for a few drinks and was pleasantly surprised. Plenty of televisions to watch football on and spacious patios. Service could use some work."}
{"text":"i was at this bar last night with some friends, my girl friend and i were having a nice time and dancing, when out of no where two flip flop wearing boys told us that we weren't allowed to dance 'in their space' and they kept threatening to get their 'girls' to fuck us up when we refused to move. they finally got security to tell us to move, i'm not sure what they told them but when i was talking to the security guard one girl threw a drink at my back and also kicked me with her flip flop feet and the security guard refused to do anything about it. he said \"i believe that both of those moves were a mistake and i won't do anything about it\" so i found a server and asked for the manager and she told me the manager was too busy because they were understaffed and walked away. i'll phone to talk to the manager today though. i'm sure this place will be closed in the next 5 months anyway. place sux."}
{"text":"We're from California and were out here for spring training. We didn't really know the area but stopped at El Hefe and so glad we did! It was such a fun atmosphere at night on the weekend. Hailey was an awesome bar tender! She was fast with service, friendly, and hooked us up with some beer samples. Would definitely recommend this place for anyone not sure what bar to try on Mill Ave in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour, Good service, Awesome food! If you're on mill and craving Mexican there is no reason you shouldn't stop in you will enjoy."}
{"text":"I have partied high and low in the world, and this institution has by far some of the best vibes around.   We need more places like this, these guys know what they're doing, keep it up!"}
{"text":"I've partied in many many places in my life. This is one of the best places to party, in the nation, if not the world. Tons of energy, amazing party vibes, reasonably priced things (I'm looking at you, Vegas), and in the Hotspot or the roaring nightlife that is Scottsdale Arizona. Party on!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to stop in for a drink on Friday so I went to El Hefe again.  First 2 time were a good experience so I went back.    This time I was stopping in a little late, about 10pm, so did not eat this time.  But I would have if I was earlier.  Greeted again by Emily and her amazing smile.  She is definitely one of the reasons I come back.  Emily and the margaritas.    Once again Emily was charming and helpful.  Never waited too long for a refill.  She was always on the spot and great to talk to.  And also incredibly beautiful!!  Next time the margaritas are calling me, I'll be back."}
{"text":"El Hefe is a great place to either just hang out with friends, grab a couple drinks and enjoy music and dancing. Oh and don't forget the food, awesome tacos and carne asada fries. Staff is always so delightful and helpful especially Bartender Amy (-: so polite, fun, easy to talk to and down to earth which you just don't get at other places on Mill!!! 5 Stars"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great food.  The tacos are a bit on the small side but that lets you get a taste of all of all of them.  Booth tables have their own beer tap!  Enough said...  The place is not very big but it is a lot of fun."}
{"text":"El sucko. I need negative stars. While visiting AZ we ended up in this section of town and looking for something Mexican like. The menu looked ok so we thought we would try it.  -For a Friday at 8pm it was dead and it felt like they weren't expecting patrons when we walked in. The host was kind of lounging couldn't tell if he worked there or just a guy sitting in a booth. -LOUD giant tv wall was cool but couldn't hear the soft spoken waitress or ourselves when she finally came over after not realizing we were one of her tables. -Two tables of fist bumping bro's seemed to get get the attention of the overwhelmed waitresses vs. the other couples or patrons. -One of our diet sodas came to the table flat twice. -They ran out of iced tea after trying to switch from flat soda. -They screwed up one of our meals. -The place seemed dirty and being open was an afterthought. Like when people show up unannounced and you are forced to entertain them.  -We paid cash while the other couple with us used credit and had to wait 10 minutes until the register was free because the other table of 12 bro's was overwhelming the hunt and pecking waitress on the cash register.  Our beers were cold, my tacos were ok but definitely not \"amazing\" like the other posters have stated. Really? People use the word amazing to describe this place? What's up with the crazy decor ? Is it a sports bar, strip club or a Mexican place? If you want pseudo Mexican with adult portions and service you are better off going to Chili's or Quedoba.  Couldn't imagine the service if this place was full. We left there annoyed and wishing we searched harder for another place to grab food and drink."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of tacos and the Duck Tacos here are FANTASTIC. I even made a second order. The pricing was much cheaper than I expected as well. The service is also great and JB is an excellent bartender."}
{"text":"So for the game last week, I was visiting this side of town and Amy was the highlight of our experience at el hefe although it was balls to the wall packed, Amy, the bartender, noticed us right away and somehow remembered our groups drinks along with few others and whipped them all up quickly (while dancing). My girlfriend and her friends loved her and have never seen someone have so much fun at work I'll mosdef be going back to her when I go back this weekend."}
{"text":"DONT EAT.  Great bar as long as you aren't hungry. Everything was inedible: enchiladas YUCK. Tacos disgusting. Rice was even bad. Chips and salsa were safe.   Service was good, drinks reasonably priced, the girls working there were beautiful and sociable. But food is a train wreck so just eat before you get there."}
{"text":"\"This table is reserved, we'll send a server right over to you\" what a bunch of lies. Sorry your kitchen closed super early on a Friday night and your drinks are over priced for their size. Walked over to five guys for a better deal. Was going to spend a pretty penny but guess not."}
{"text":"First off, I just have to say that the el hefe dog = heaven. This is not your typical bar food, it's actually good. I've had lunch and happy hour (dinner) several times at el hefe, had very good service and the food was excellent in quality/taste. Because of the times of day I have been there, I'm sure my experience is different than those who went at night when it's jammed, but so far I've had no reason to not go back just for the food & happy hour."}
{"text":"Where do I start? Went here on New Year's Eve. Got there fairly early cause we had a big group and wanted to secure a table on the patio. Was sitting there and like around after 9 'o clock a security gaurd comes over and says they are taking away our table. We explained that's why we got there early, the security guard said it's out of his hands his manager told him to. We asked to speak to the manager and another security gaurd came over. We asked for a refund on the guys cover charges since it was shitty that they were taking away the table. He was rude and laughed and said that's not going to happen, and that we can get a table for $1,200. We said well you shouldn't have had this table here on NYE so people think they can sit at it and then take it away when it's full. We agreed to leave the bar and as one of the guys in our group goes to push in his chair surrounded by 4 security gaurds he touches one the gaurds with the chair as he's pushing it in and the guard shoves him and then all 4 guards take one guy down and pull him off the property line and start punching him. Not a fair fight. They detain him and the one gaurd starts reading Him his rights. I said excuse me your not a cop you don't have the fight to do that. He said that he was a cop for 5 years so yes i can. I said well your shirt says security not PD so you don't have that authority to do so. He was threatening that he was going to jail. Again your security you can't determine that.  All in all the security was on a power Trip and like to play by their rules and the other staff wasn't friendly either. If I could give 0 stars I would but I have to leave one."}
{"text":"Awesome place! If you like loud music and having fun this is the place to be in Scottsdale. We got a table and bottle service, which worked out very well. I will definitely be returning if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Really bad music. Won't take requests. Weird techno remixes of every song to where you can't even enjoy it. You can tell how bad a DJ is by how many people were dancing! (5 out of 85 ppl) they're just copying literally every bar in Phoenix. There were 3 of them. Only a very few bars in Phoenix have good music but these guys insist on playing only their crappy own music. If you think you wanna be a DJ, go to LA, this isn't the place!! Rude DJs, nice security, ok bartenders. I feel bad for the women bartenders who are forced to dance on tables with no tips, when it's not even a crazy dancing club? Lol. Still on the search for a fun bar in all of Phoenix."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday morning and Payton was my server. I wasn't sure what to order and she recommended the carne Asada fries. They were delicious. Jade, the manager came over to see how everything was and showed she cared about customers and the restaurant. I will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"No draft beer available which was a major disappointment looking for a brew and hanging on the patio. The bottle beer selection was limited and did not have what was listed on the menu. Settled for the 3 or 4 beers that were available by bottle. Staff was friendly and apologetic but not worth the trip if you are looking for a cold beer. However, went across the street and left H, H & H!!"}
{"text":"Terrible unprofessional service from our bartender tonight. She must have been having a bad night or something. There were 7 of us that came up to the bar to order drinks, after standing there for like 10 mins, she finally graced us with her attention. Mind you there were only like 15 people in the bar..... We asked her to make us all the house margarita, not hard at all, it's a house mix, after rolling her eyes about 10 times, she finally decided it was worth her time to make them. We got our checks back, we all tipped her 20-25 percent, which was generous considering her horrible service. We all got back to our table and we heard her yell out across the bar, \"they didn't even tip me!\"  Who yells that across a bar??? Sorry little girl, terrible service gets a 20% tip. You didn't earn anything better than that. Horrible service doesn't earn you anything else."}
{"text":"My husband and I went in for an early dinner before a Livewire Concert, so we didn't get much of the \"bar\" atmosphere, which was fine with us. I liked the restaurant. Our server was so sweet, but obviously new to the job, which we didn't mind. The food was okay. It was one of those places that wasn't bad, but wasn't great.  Would I go back? Probably."}
{"text":"I don't expect much from a bar that also is a restaurant but we had such slow and horrible service when the place was empty. They seem to care more about their social lives than their guests. Went in for happy hour and the server didn't even know what the happy hour margarita was. Took forever to get a drink and when we wanted to order another drink she was no where to be found. She didn't come back around until 7:01 and we missed the \"cut off\" for another drink on happy hour but she didn't tell us. Also had to move from the booths to a table because there was a cockroach crawling around. We let the server know and she said she'd tell a manager then we saw them sit someone else at that same table 2 minutes later. I'll go somewhere else next time for $2 tacos and and $13 margarita for \"happy hour\""}
{"text":"I'm NEVER coming here again!  When I first came I was waiting in line forever while the security/bouncer let several people ahead of me. I didn't see them check anything off a list so they couldn't be VIP or anything like that.  Then, I finally get in and the service just ISN'T there. I wait and wait and finally the bartender takes my order, and gives me a very weak drink! HELLO? I DIDN'T PAY $7 FOR A GLASS OF COCA COLA!! I ASKED FOR A JACK AND COKE!  Don't believe the hype, this place sucks!  Also El Hefe claims to have amazing tacos... I've had better tacos from a taco bus back home in Seattle, Washington."}
{"text":"Service was terrible, I was waiting in line with 2 girl friends when the bouncer strolled by and complained about my sneakers when everyone else was wearing sneakers such as mine. I felt totally discriminated , I'm no college muscle head jock so maybe I didn't fit in, lucky for the bouncer the oink patrol was there so my 2nd degree blackbelt and boxing background didn't have to be used to shame his ignorance and lack of respect."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today and it was great. Decor is fun, love the clear plastic covers on the floral booths!  Lots of TV's around the bar which can be seen from just about everywhere in the club.  We had chips and salsa to start.  We all agreed that the red (hot) salsa was the best, although they were all good.  For lunch we had Sonoran Dogs.  Very big and tasty!  Service was good too!  Looking forward to our next visit to try the tacos..."}
{"text":"1st time here. Came here because it was part of the taco crawl event. After a quick ID check, headed to the back for our taco. The tortilla was nice and fluffy & plenty of meat and fixings. I would say the best taco out of the taco crawl compared to Dos Gringos, Dierks & Bentley which was across the street (ran out of tacos but offered a free drink) Bevvy also across the street (ran out of tacos & no free drink) & Wasted Grain.   Not to big inside but loved the open window seats especially on a nice day! Bartenders were great! We were lucky to find a table, liked the big TV screens & DJ was awesome playing today's hits & old school."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before it's really not a place you want to hang out or waste your time or money either, their service is horrible and I really wanted to give them 0 stars but I had to at least give 1 for staying open and employing ppl with bad attitudes! My family has restaurants and clubs so I know what it is to be in that atmosphere when it gets busy but the girls that work there are the worst I never complain because I feel Yelp is only to state the bad over the good but I had to take a minute out of my day to say something about this place!"}
{"text":"I dont get why this place has 2 stars. You gotta know what you're getting yourself into here.  This is where you go for mediocre drinks and good looking girls, anyone who judges this place based on service is a joke. I for one am enjoying a margarita surrounded by friends having a great time. Fuck the haters  Martinez out."}
{"text":"Went here pre Livewire show 10/21/15. The service was good, but the food was meh. Ordered the Elote Dip and was not impressed. I don't know if it was to be served hot/warm, but cold it was. Tasted like eating creamed corn straight from a can. My sisters and I shared the 3 taco plate with each of us trying a different taco. Mine was the shrimp one and again it was served cold and I think there was one shrimp in there. The other tacos my sisters had also were cold.   The location of El Hefe is great with lots of potential, but I would not make this a must go back to for myself or friends."}
{"text":"Although this place is best known for its party (they know how to throw a party like a boss), their food is pretty decent.  I had the carne asada tacos and were inexpensive, tasteful and filing.  You can't ask for much more.  Cheers"}
{"text":"I wish I could write a zero.  They clearly don't give a damn about good service, they'll survive on Friday and Saturday alone so they can suck all week.  I brought in 10 guys on a Monday night.  They messed up 10 orders.  As slow as possible with everything wrong.  Stay away? Go somewhere that they care about customers, this isn't your place."}
{"text":"Bloody Mary's for Brunch......awesome....buy one for $12 and get as many as you want for 25 cents each!  Did I mention it comes with crispy bacon?  Tacos were great too!"}
{"text":"So much for Sunday Funday the waitresses are more interested in the guys then taking care of you"}
{"text":"Our service was not good. Our server was Emili and it took 15 minutes for the first margarita and at least 10 minutes for the second margarita. We never got water refills. We had to ask another server for utensils and needed to grab our own napkins. We needed to ask 3 other people for our check because we couldn't find her."}
{"text":"After about 6 Sunday football games they discontinued their Football program where each week if you go you get free things, leading up to a Free Happy Hour with up to 20 friends.  3 of us were dedicated and going every Sunday dropping $50 to $100 bux each time, while suffering through HORRIBLE service, dirty conditions, a management that could give a shit less.  They obviously are focused on the night life crowds and not the daytime.  They old us on either the 6th or 7th visit when we whipped our cards out  and it was time for a free T-Shirt the bartender said \"we quit doing those\" and then the manager came over.  He promised that he would figure out something for us since we were loyal customer for the past weeks, he did pick up our drinks (1 each) and if I didn't have anywhere to be later that day I would have sat and drank all day on his tab.  None of us have ever heard back from anyone at El Hefe, let alone from JUSTIN (the manager) who promised us he would get back to us.  I will NEVER EVER step foot in this bar again.  Save yourself time and walk down to Majerie's, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Bummer!  I'm from SF visiting AZ for a debate program. Went here to grab some cheap eats. Long story short, the waitress overcharged us. When confronted, she said she had no way to fix the error. Whatever ... That was annoying. My friend requested salsa and when told she had to pay for it, she made a genuinely confused face. The waiter (different one) said awkwardly \"you don't have to look at me like that.\" It was a weird vibe killer. Moving on Food : bad. Had a Torta that was overly sweet. No free chips , you pay for salsa. Tacos were weird too. One tortilla, no salsa to put on them.  But the cardinal sin here is when she offered to get me a beer, she lagged because she was busy flirting with men around. Listen sister, we had a long, hot ass day in Arizona. The least you could do is get me a cold beer, on time so I can drink while my friends are eating. Not chug a beer before we have to run.  + one star for the bartender who spoke to me and gave me a discount. Really nice guy. I wish the food could save this experience, but that was not worth the money either. ) :"}
{"text":"This place is by far my favorite place on Mill. They have the nicest staff and their hostess is an Angel"}
{"text":"I had a great taco and beer.  I like the place. But nobody chats with me, not even the bartender."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time on Sunday. I was really excited to try this place out, and chose this place over many other great restaurants. The menu looked promising at first, but the food was just okay and as were the drinks. We were sat at a booth which was great, but we didn't have any utensils, and my drink order was wrong TWICE, for a beer...  By this time I was over it, it took a whole 30 minutes for us to see the waitress to ask for some lime and hot sauce for our tacos. It wasn't that they were too busy or anything, I believe it's just their staff is poorly trained and delivered sub par customer service. Will not be returning here."}
{"text":"I would have given higher rating if based on food and drinks only, however I had a bad experience being overcharged on my credit card. I called and my message was never returned. Its annoying to have to resolve their mistake when you have a busy schedule.  So to me, questionable service and management put a big damper on my experience.  Tip-try the duck taco  Tip- try the beer-garita Tip- cool beer tap right in the tables!"}
{"text":"I came here at 5pm on a weekday and the music was just too loud. I'm 21, I like to party just like everyone else but the music doesn't need to be THAT loud for a dinner crowd. It took at leas 10+ minutes for a server to even acknowledge my existence after I seated myself at a booth... I got a couple of tacos, and had the chips and guacamole. I have been here before and loved the tacos, but these just fell really short and left me unsatisfied."}
{"text":"I went to El Hefe yesterday with Gare. The decor is a bit over-the-top but cool and different. Think Día de los Muertos meets Electric Ladyland.   We sat at the bar and had the Pork Belly Torta and Carnitas Tacos. The food was tasty and even impressed my boyfriend the chef.   I'd go back again but avoid ordering anything off their drink menu without finding out the ingredients--who knew that Four Loko is a flavored, colored alcoholic soda-like beverage that tastes like otterpops with cheap vodka? And who would want that in their margarita?   Maybe it's a sign of the times; I'm getting old not keeping up with what's what in the world of flavored liquors. Our server was nice to comp the drink that I wasn't a fan of -- this is always a good move in the service industry. Kudos on good customer service to El Hefe."}
{"text":"The 2-star description is labeled as \"Meh, I've experienced better.\" That basically sums up El Hefe. Came here late this past Saturday night for my sister's 21st birthday. The line to get in was outrageously long, and we waited probably close to 30-40 minutes before we decided to just pay the bouncer to let us in... wasn't worth it.   The layout of El Hefe is basically this: everything is centered around the bar. The restaurant is pretty much in the shape of a rectangle, with the bar in the middle of it. On the outer layer is the private-VIP seats, and the space between the bar and the seats is your \"dance space\" (I'm not even going to call it a dance floor because it's way too small to be that). There's a DJ on one end of the restaurant, and there's a little bit more room to dance there, but it's just so crowded that you basically can't dance without being back to back or shoulder to shoulder with everyone around you. Even buying a drink is difficult. You'll get your area at the bar and try to order a drink, but the bartenders just go to whomever--not really noticing who's been standing there for longer or shorter periods of time.   I don't know my experience was a typical of El Hefe, or if it was just really busy this past Saturday, but one thing's for sure--I have definitely experienced better at other bars in Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place is always will staffed & busy but fun. Can't confirm the food but the margaritas are top notch fun."}
{"text":"I can give the food the second chance. However, I still find it unpleasant to be served by half-naked girls in the middle of the day. I am not a conservative and very attractive female who fells free wearing mini dresses and shorts. But, I absolutely find it inappropriate to get food from someone who barely covered. Where is the hygiene? Additionally, there are many other ways to present sexuality (if this is the policy of the place), mature ways that will attract different customers. Place lacks friendly smiling  personal, good selection of beer (Miller, Budweiser and etc topped by one or two local breweries choices). If you want attract customers who value good food, drinks, and service, you need to change some things around. Until then, I will think about ElHefe as a place where people come to get drunk by drinking shitty beer or poor quality drinks at high prices and look at booties! I may be rough with the way I wrote. I very seldom give negative reviews. In this case, I was highly disappointed by the place"}
{"text":"Went for taco Tuesdays. Tacos were great and our server Madison was awesome! She was very friendly and attentive. It was pretty busy and she still made sure we had everything we needed. Great job Madison!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Serious!!! The atmosphere is ok. I went there for happy hour with 4 co-workers. The margaritas are watered down. 5 drinks in and a shot later I was charged a $7 gratuity. Didn't notice it till I looked at my receipt and like an idiot I still dropped a tip. I can see if it was a party of 8. I got robbed and the drinks were as cheap as the decor. Plus service was not attentive to my table, had to flag down service. Will never go to this place again AND I recommend going somewhere else if you're trying to get your happy on for happy hour. SMH get it together! I should have went to RA."}
{"text":"Hefe is so fun and the hosts Are so nice, especially Brynn! She helped us get a table immediately!"}
{"text":"This bar is really entertaining. It's managed to stay pretty consistently fun throughout the past couple of years; most other bars in Old Town get old quick. They have a solid selection of beers, good music, and are frequented by a fairly young crowd.  If you're going to go here, head over kinda early. It gets super packed around midnight and it's almost impossible to fight through the crowd to get a drink at the bar."}
{"text":"I enjoyed lunch at El Hefe last Saturday. I ordered the SuperMacho Bowl with vegetarian charro beans and no cheese. The flavor was good and the portion was sufficient for lunch. We also had chips with salsa and guacamole. You have to pay $3 for chips and salsa, but you get unlimited refills of chips. So it was worth it. Everyone else at the table has the Tres Tacos Especial plate. I tried a bite of the Deep Fried Avocado taco, and the mahi mahi taco. Both We're tasty. I was told the Chicken Tinga taco was delicious, but the Al Pastor taco was too dry. Everyone enjoyed the black beans, but I didn't try them as they have bacon. It was not very crowded for a Saturday afternoon and there were plenty of TVs playing the football game. I'd go again."}
{"text":"Love the burger amazing.  Incredible tacos and atmophere.  Love love love the open air bar area.  Attentive service and the manager even checked up on us we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went here with my nephew who was in from out of town because I'd had fun here before. We had a two drinks each, shared some chips & salsa, and 3 street tacos. Walked out of there spending nearly $70 on a very small lunch. The chips come with 3 different salsas, but they are not free like other Mexican restaurants, The tacos are decent, but overall, this place is a little pricey.   I don't think the bartender smiled once, although she was nice enough to tell my nephew that old town Scottsdale is the place to hang out. THAT kind of explains the non-existant smile on the pretty little blonde's face the entire time. Probably won't go back here again unless it's HH, because they do have their house margaritas for half-price ($5)."}
{"text":"El hefe is good during the day for drinks but the drinks after ten are serious sugar overload, my AMF was the darkest of blue. It felt like drinking Kool aid with every drink I recieved. And they don't serve margaritas after 10!!!?? Can't they just be like every typical bar that serves the short margaritas with no salt and limes after 10? Just dissapointing and our bartender was rude when I asked for one."}
{"text":"My first time at El Hefe wasn't too bad, compared to the rest of the reviews. I tried their signature margarita w/ dos XX as Marissa (server) recommended during Friday happy hour. It was good, but not the best since it tasted a bit watered down. It was also $5 for 32 oz.. However, not too long after I noticed a hair in my drink and I was definitely unhappy about it. The nearest server took it away for me and Marissa said they'd replace it with a new drink on the house. Got another beerita and it tasted a lot better/stronger than the first. Normally a 3 star rating, but another star for their music. Best playlist I've heard in a while. I'd probably go again. Hopefully, I don't get another hair in my drink...."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday evening w one of my gfs. Got seated at a deserted corner table in the way back which was fine bc there was a bunch of obnoxious drunks acting a fool up front anyway so yes, seat me far away from those crazies please.  The waitress came over and took our drink orders which came out fairly quickly, btw. Just as I was about to take a sip, I noticed a nice and shiny strand of HAIR sticking out of it. Oh, how lovely. Proceeded to look around for our waitress for about 20 mins or so but she was nowhere to be found. Actually had to flag down some guy who was clearing out the table next to us and told him the dilemma. He then says \"I believe you and everything but can you point it out to me bc I don't see it.\" Why of course I will. I'll also kindly floss your teeth with it, if you'd like. Like seriously? Ugh. He then goes back and finds our waitress, she asks if I want the bar to make me a new one but I declined. We dipped and went down to RA instead where service was much better, and no hair was found in my drink!   I definitely liked it better when this place used to be Canteen."}
{"text":"Bartenders are awesome. However, the manager is laxadaisical amd worthless. You could clearly see how he was influencing the servers to do less and ignore their customers.  Friday night manager needs to go if they want to maintain a busy bar. And the worst part cockroaches in the ice and the bartender continued to use the bug ridden ice. How gross!! Thankfully i was drinking bottled beer"}
{"text":"The employees think they are too good to serve you, wish i never would have tipped the rude bartenders who told me to \"shoo\" after ordering almost a hundred dollars in drinks. I will never be coming back and i tell everyone to stay away when going to mill because i just dont want them to waste their money or have a bad experience, sucks though cause they play good music and have an awesome dance floor but not worth the snotty vibe"}
{"text":"I have only been here once and I came on a Saturday night so I can't and won't comment on the food service/quality but the actual nightclub or whatever is a lot of fun! As soon as we got to Mill we weren't sure where to go cuz we had never been there before and we saw El Hefe and wanted to go but we also saw the line and at first said no. After going into a couple of places we decided to bite the bullet and wait in line. They absolutely had the BEST music (out of the 3 places we went) and the best atmosphere. I was in jeans, a shirt, and combat boots as was my friend and her bf was in jeans as well.....idk what people are talking about a dress code cuz we had no problem at all. Idk if they have changed their rules since we went like last month or what but we experienced no problem getting in. We are all 3 100% Mexican, and you can tell, and got zero dirty looks or remarks. Again not sure where race or color came into play with other reviews but I only know MY experience.   The drink service at the bar was pretty quick for being so packed the only thing is we didn't like our drinks but we were experimenting with drinks so maybe they just weren't our taste. Moral of the story- we're coming back this weekend."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area, and headed down to Mill ave to get into some trouble. El Hefe had good music, a lot of beautiful girls, and all the booze a man could ask for. All in all it was a lot if fun, and the people were very nice.   We went there again during the day and had some tacos, the food was very tasty, the bartender/waitress was awesome, and the price was very reasonable. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Pros:   Great Music   Good Looking People   Great Location   Excellent Layout  Cons:   Biased Door Policy   Asshole Security   Inhumane Bathroom Conditions  The Rest  Servers are decent, but can get overwhelmed due to the volume of customers, moderate drinks prices although drinks are watered down. Overall it's geared to serve as a meat market for college kids that have yet to grasp the value of competent service."}
{"text":"This place was so crowded and fun on Xmas eve. Very loud, but the bartender was fast and responsive to my party of 6's needs. She even facilitated my request to dance on the bar and said I could stay up there for as long as I wanted. I'll definitely go back to this place.  If there was an option for 3.5 stars, I'd do that instead."}
{"text":"Bouncers are the worst on mill. If you go as a group don't expect to get in at the same time as each other. Bouncers will let the women in first, which makes sense because it must be hard to get women to see the appeal of a shitty loud hooters knock off that serves c rate overpriced tacos. Save yourself some time and go to literally any other bar on mill"}
{"text":"If I I could give a place less than 1 star I would. I never experienced the worst service I think I have came to El Hefe in Scottsdale. I came here many times and never had a better time until they accused my boyfriend of throwing up all over the floor even. After this was unproven they continue to tears us like we were nonexistent but it didn't matter. After these dumb severs found out who did it, they never expressed gratitude towards us and I feel bad for this bar because they have terrible services. Unless you are a single white man with a lot of money don't expect anything from this shitty bar."}
{"text":"Brought a party of 4 here for lunch but we never made it in the door . I was wearing camo and our party was rejected by the bouncer at the front door . We were told that camo is not welcome into this establishment. Just want to give our soldiers who protect our country that you are not welcome here . It's a shame that el hefe welcomes drunken frat boys over our military."}
{"text":"Lol this Hefe is such a joke. I walked in here with my boyfriend and we had 4 others meeting us, the hostess' told us they were totally full with no tables available and that it would be a 25 minute wait, mind you, it wasn't even that busy. We wondered around to see if we could manage sitting at the bar, we then saw there were 2 tables outside, a 2 seater and a 6 seater table. We then went and asked if we could sit at the 6 seater and just go to the bar and get our own drinks, the hostess' agreed and then we sat down. The hostess came walking up with a group of 4 and said that we were not able to sit there because she has a table of 4 she needs to sit, I assured her we had 6 people with us and 4 were on the way. She then argued and told us to leave the table. We even talked to the \"manager\" who was sweeping outside and did absolutely nothing to accommodate us. Don't waste your time with this establishment."}
{"text":"Hard to say a bad thing about this place. Bar tending is primo. Customer service... Spot on. The food is the best in Old Town.   Amongst all the glory hole places on \"the strip\"  in Old town, you cannot go wrong with The Boss."}
{"text":"After coming here for the first time last weekend, I don't really understand the hate that this place gets. This past Sunday evening, my husband and I came in here as our first stop on Mill for the night. The first thing we noticed was that the place smelled AMAZING. Whatever air freshener they have is incredible! We sat at the bar and were greeted by a very attractive bartender who was quick with our drink orders and answered all of our questions. We had a few draft beers and their tequila bombers, which were super tasty and at a good price. The decor and atmosphere of the bar is great. I loved the pink accent lighting and the pattern on the booths. There was one group that had definitely imbibed a lot of liquor that day and were getting a little rowdy and dancing on top of the booths, but it's Mill, and I wasn't really surprised.  Overall, we had a blast, and we will definitely stop here every time we go to Mill Avenue!"}
{"text":"First time, LAST time! Rude staff. It was less than 50% full on a Saturday evening, yet the \"bro-tender\", after looking right at us, decided to fill his condiment trays rather than take our drink order, or even acknowledge us. Also tried a table, but the waitress was super unfriendly. We left and walked to Zipps, where we got fast friendly service."}
{"text":"If I could give El Hefe 3.5 stars I would. This bar seems to be one of those places where you can expect a certain type of crowd. It's like a middle ground between The Lodge and Dos Gringos.   On a regular Friday or Saturday night El Hefe is a good place to get a quick drink or to just hang out. There always seems to be somewhere you can sit down or hang out at this place, unlike some other bars.   I also went here on NYE and it was very fun. Paid a cover charge and then drinks were a penny all night.   The vibe of the bar is half undergrad Spring Break, half an episode of Miami Ink. However, the service is good and the drinks are strong. Don't let the D-bag outer layer deter you for giving El Hefe a shot. I have yet to try the food, but I am doubtful with all of the options in Old Town I would ever choose to come to El Hefe for their food."}
{"text":"I've been to El Hefe twice. The first time we went for the food. Our service was okay and the food was average. We had no plans of every coming back. Unfortunately, we decided to come back and check out the night scene. Too bad we never got to go in because my friend had a camo pants on. The bouncers at the door told us it's against the dress code. Seems like other yelp users have had similar experiences. I'm totally game for a dress code but theirs seems ridiculous. If you're going to go to El Hefe look up prior what the dress code is because there is a good chance you will be violating it . As for my friends and I, we will be spending our time and money elsewhere."}
{"text":"To give El Jefe it's chance is difficult. It's the kind of place that you either like or dislike with an undying passion. I have been coming for a few years now and it does not disappoint. The music is great the crowd is diverse and there is always a familiar face. That being said it is often far too crowded on Friday nights and fights are frequent to put it mildly. But Jefe has become a Mill icon nonetheless. I will continue to go there for the nostalgia alone. If you ever go on taco Tuesday's order the fried avocado tacos. They are incredible!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place!!!! Went there for happy hour on Friday. The bulldog margarita was an epic deal! A huge margarita with a dos xx for $7! And chips and queso fundido for $6. Really good sized portion, was perfect to share! But the bulldog Margarita... again...was Amazing!! It's a half price on Friday's from 4-10. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Went here for Taco Tuesday for the first time and the tacos were incredible. They were served very fast and my server was quick to ask if I needed anything else.  When I made a trip to the bar, the bartender (Tori) was awesome. She brought me my beer with a smile on her face.  The food and the customer service together are why I gave this place 5 stars. Can't wait to bring my friends in SD back here!"}
{"text":"Is \"macho\" supposed to mean that you don't know how to cook so you go on the cheap to feed people either bland, tasteless, re-heated frozen food or put so much sugar in it that you hope they won't notice it and then charge them way too much for it?  If so, El Hefe in Tempe has nailed it!  First, I have to say that I work right next door to this location. I've seen the transformation from Canteen to El Hefe and honestly, I don't get it.  Canteen fit pretty well into the surrounding shops while having a unique store front appearance.    El Hefe, on the other hand, is this massively gaudy, wood and steel behemoth that has overextended their boundaries.  They've stretched their front patio space nearly out onto Mill avenue and their back patio has been extended almost over into the neighboring Five Guys and Jimmy Johns.  It's obnoxious.  As for the food, it is mediocre to bad.  We started with the chips and salsa.  The chips were thin and well salted, but slightly stale.  These were accompanied by three salsas, a super sweet tomatillo (my coworker actually asked if there was relish in it), a pico de gallo that was okay - but needed some salt, lime and time to come together, and a red salsa that quite honestly didn't taste like anything.    I myself had the chicken tinga tacos with their \"green cilantro rice\".  The rice tasted like something you'd get at the grocery store in a bag or box and just add the parboiled (minute) rice and seasoning mix to boiling water to make.  Nasty.  The chicken tinga tacos were just okay, having a hint of chorizo to them, but also very sweet to the point of overpowering any flavor of chicken that you might be hoping for.  This is exacerbated by their tacos in general being quite small (about 4\" across).  I also noticed that the consistency from one taco to the next was quite off.    My co-worker had an assortment of tacos.  The carne asada taco he quite liked.  The fish taco tasted \"old\" to him, indicating that the single chunk of battered fish was likely straight from the freezer.  The pork al pastor taco was so sweet that he actually didn't finish it, stating it was one of the worst taco's he's ever had.  So.. seven small taco's, about a cup and a half worth of green minute rice with some cilantro in it, chips and salsa (which if I overheard correctly, they charge for salsa refills) and two waters came out to just under $30.  For two lunches that didn't satiate either of us.  Needless to say, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"If your idea of a fun night out is standing shoulder to shoulder watching a room full of douchebags and plastic women in a bar, then this is the place for you.  Will not go back.  Too loud, too packed, too fake.  Bartenders were more concerned about performing then pouring (some guy behind the bar was juggling, and then drinking liqour, from his SHOES...???), the meatheads in the bar were pre-occupied with shining up their sunglasses (that they wear \"at night\")....the entire vibe in this place is overwhelmingly douchey.  Overpriced, too.  At the bottom of my list for old town bars."}
{"text":"Came here and drinks were very good and dj is good on  weekends. Highly recommend on any weekend very cool place"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time on Saturday afternoon just by chance. It wasn't busy (yet - but started to fill up for the UFC fights later that night) and I sat at the bar. The waitress and bartender were both friendly and attentive. I tried the beef cheek taco, the pork taco and the duck taco with flour tortillas and enjoyed all three immensely. With a Dr. Pepper, my total bill was $12, and I was perfectly full and content. I didn't realize this place has a reputation as a \"party\" bar but I can see, with all the TVs around the bar, it probably gets nuts on sports nights. But if you just want to go and have some really tasty and affordable gourmet tacos, I recommend going for lunch or an early dinner and avoiding the crowds."}
{"text":"Extremely rasist manager. I was with my African American friend who is well dressed not like a douche and works the industry so he understands the rules. We had the pleasure of meeting hefes \"greatest\" manager named Austin. We were both sober patiently waiting in 100 degree weather for 20 minutes. When we get to the front Austin decides that my friends shirt is too tight around his arms. The shirt is normal length and not tight around the body and Austin deamed it to be not acceptable and decided to let 2 white men in with just as tight of shirts and laughed at us when we tried to calmly resolve the situation. Austin intearagated my friend wanting to know which bar he worked at and we refused to tell him in fear he would call our bosses. I am amazed this fellow has a job with such lack of professionalism. The situation could have been handled a lot better. hopefully riot will handle this appropriately"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night. The manager came to our table even on a busy night to ask if everything was good. Very, very impressive.  I've been to mill a million times and not had a manager approach me on a busy night to ask how things were. A the service has been great and the food is good. Drinks definitely great as well."}
{"text":"You cannot go to Tempe and miss out on El Hefe!  They have an excellent Menu and great drinks.  Be careful if you meet Erika and Lolo.  They are trouble."}
{"text":"Had a blast til someone broke a bottle and they didn't take me seriously for how bad the break was. There were shards everywhere and women with open shoes on! The bottom of the bottle was extremely dangerous because if anyone stepped directly on it they woulda had a lawsuit. The security shrugged it off at first but I didn't give up because I was trying to think about their business! Had they not cleaned it up, I woulda taken further action. But I just wanted to have a good night out. Just wish they woulda been more concerned about it since it is a dancing place!!"}
{"text":"Service was super slow and they got half of my order wrong.  When tacos came out 40 minutes later they were really good, but they had my sides wrong. They made it right by bringing out the correct side to me 5 minutes later.  The place and the logo is really cool but once you're inside it is kinda lame.  The waitresses are all hot and in skimpy outfits, but it just doesn't have a fun vibe.  Food overall was good though."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite to watch the baseball playoffs and had a really good meal at the same time.  The Chicken Tinga Taco with Jicama and Mango Salsa was awesome.  The Carne Asada Taco with pickled radish and salsa fresca was also very good.  My only suggestion is to make them bigger, since they are so good.  Also had the chips with 3 types of salsa that was bottomless.    Service was excellent.  I'll definitely be back and based on the vibe, I need to check-out happy hour, since I bet this place is rockin'."}
{"text":"Food is good, drinks is good. But the female bartender is ok. Customer service is not her best but she knows how to make a good drink. She was pretty tired, which i can understand but atleast try to be warm and friendly. Pretty chill place didn't know that the restaurant turns into a nightclub. Last call for food was around 11pm i think.  The people in this town are interesting i don't think they are used to seeing interracial couple. Just a bunch of people that party and get drunk in this downtown. Margaritas are good af!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, awesome food.. Love being able to sit outside and have a beverage and a cigar. Come here frequently when I'm in Tempe. Great place to bring a group also."}
{"text":"One of the bartenders with a nose piecing, beard, and tattoos all along his left arm denied me 2 glasses of water when I was begging to have them for my friend who was having an anxiety attack all because , \"I was yelling and being rude\" he made me go find my friend before he would give the water to me. After I found her, he tried to be super nice to her after seeing how pale white she was. As a bartender you never deny a customer water. What a low life."}
{"text":"Although it's extremely loud the place is really cool and has tasty food and drinks. I really like the decor and the feel of the inside and the marketing. They have happy hour from 3-7 every day with $2 tacos and 3$ Dos XX as well as $5 specialty margaritas. Tons of TV's and a nice patio in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale. The bartender was great and very quick. All of the tacos I tried were very good. I will go back and try more items again. P.S. LOVE the fake mustaches they provide free of charge. Mucho funo."}
{"text":"bitches love Hefe! taco Tuesday, boss Thursday, and Sunday funday... Hefe has got you covered. Don't bring people here that don't like to Party. Hefe is not for the weak. that's why it's super macho of course.  Just ask Kivanc, Jono, Justin,  Devin, Thomas, Parker, or Soltero.... If I forgot anyone I apologize!"}

{"text":"Got a message from the owner. I appreciate that at least - though it doesn't really change my view on my experience and my review still holds. To soften it though, I'll just say this place definitely isn't for me."}
{"text":"Came here during the day for a late lunch before our flight out of town. We sat outside and there weren't a lot of other people. Our server was good in terms of didn't need to write our orders down and prompt, but a little cold/distant. The food was good though - I really enjoyed the fried avocado taco!"}
{"text":"stopped by this week to grab a cocktail while enjoying the awesome weather and some NBA action.  All the staff was helpful and a call out to Berlin who was really nice and a good sport about giving my boss a hard time (as he bailed on this trip).  I also met some nice new peeps and I wish ROH hadn't wiped their names from my brain."}
{"text":"So I have been here once about 2 months ago. Stopped in for food. I liked my tacos I got, but overall it was okay. BUT was out in tempe bar hopping and I had been here before to eat so I figured I would check it out to see how the night scene was here. walked up and it seemed like it was less than half capacity. Get up to the bouncer and he denies me entrance....because i have nike sandals on. I just looked at him stunned. Went over and talked to another bouncer and was explained that athletic sandals are against the dress code. (sandals are apparently okay, but apparently if it has a swoosh that's crossing the line????)  I understand having a dress code, but that is stupidly specific and with no explanation given as to why...kind of frustrating. I will add that the bouncers were polite about it. They were not mean about it in any way so thanks for that I guess.   In the end, I had no problem giving my money to another bar that doesnt have silly rules like that. Didn't ruin my night, but was a short lived mood killer."}
{"text":"This place is a work of art - and not in the good way. This is my third review of El Hefe Tempe and I think this may as well be my last. I originally posted in March 2015 a 3-star and was immediately contacted by Hefe staff to try to make things right. They did and on June 2015 I wrote an updated 4-star review. Now a year later here I am again writing another review.  To be straight here - I like El Hefe. I like their music better than most places on Mill. But, good riddens, they try so hard to be more prestigious than they really are. You are not Vegas.  I recently tried to book some bottle service for a birthday party and was surprised by both the level of attention and the prices. To start off, I filled out the webform online to have someone contact me. No response. I tried emailing them at the address they have listed. No response. I tried texting them. No response. I tried the webform again. No response. Due to my previous bad experience I had obtained the personal name and number of the GM so I decided to send them, Rob, a personal Yelp message. No response. So I finally broke down and texted him on his personal number that he gave me a year ago.  Finally, a response.  Shortly thereafter his VIP guy, Thomas, messaged me about bottle service. Here is the breakdown - $1000 for the big table inside by the DJ, $500 for the tables next to the dance floor, and $250 for the patio. Who the hell wants to sit outside on the patio for bottle service? Not me - what is the fun in that? A year ago I had got bottle service, off the dance floor, for $200. And that was on the 4th of July weekend. Why did the price go up so drastically, especially seeing as how the weekend I was requesting wasn't even a holiday like last time?  I asked if they would give me the same deal as last time and they said, no thanks.  I guess they have other patrons that are willing to fork out $500 for table, so why settle for less. Just for a comparison, I ended up going next door to Whiskey Row and got a table that included a bottle and beer, immediately off the dance floor for $250. Slight difference.  I don't blame them so much for the prices. You charge in-line for the demand. If your place is able to charge $500 and people regularly are willing to pay that, then by all counts don't sell low. What I do have a problem with is the absolute lack of response. I can see things getting mixed up through one of the communication methods but for me to be ignored twice through the webform, once through email, once through texting, once through Yelp messaging is absolutely ridiculous. To have it so the ONLY way I was able to get a response was to contact the GM on his personal number of which was given to me from a prior incident is ridiculous x3.  Being ignored as such makes me feel like they have a certain client group that brings them business and be damned if they are nice or courteous to new people. You have to have an IN, otherwise, buzz the **** off, we don't need your money. If there is anything I hate more, it is begging people to take my money.  The only reason that Hefe Tempe gets 2-stars instead of 1-star is because they have great music. I'm adding this to my Pot-o-douchebaggery Yelp list and I don't think I'll be coming back. My suggestion is that if you're looking for a good time, go next door and save yourself some money."}
{"text":"If you get a girl named MEGAN you might as well be talking to a brick wall! She is the biggest Bitch I have EVER come across!!! Fire her if you know what's good for business!!! She was RUDE"}
{"text":"This place will have you wait 10 to 20 minutes before they acknowledge you, and once they do they will refuse service.  If you see a redhead bartender tip her 0.00 dollars."}
{"text":"If only the tacos were as good as they looked. I got two of their \"popular\" tacos (forgot the name). The presentation was awesome, but it lacked flavor.    I also got a strawberry margarita. On a scale from 1-10 (10 being fantastic) I would give it a 7.   The vibe is great, a very young energetic atmosphere."}
{"text":"Bring a pair of ear plugs or two.  I was deaf for like 10 minutes after coming out of this place.  Still don't know what all the hypes are about this place seeing there are always a line waiting to get it every Fridays and Saturdays.  The interior space is very small and you can't really dance with anyone in your group.  I'll be staying away from this place for a while before returning there again."}
{"text":"Not your typical take your parents to this bar/restaurant. We went out for a 30th birthday. Being 27 I loved it, but it was a bit awkward to bring your parents to. It started off fine, but at 10 it changes to the night club which is to be expected given it it downtown mill. However, what was not expected was the female dress code. At 10:30 pm, when we left, the women had changed into skimpy bras with booty shorts that were more close to thongs.   They have a great atmosphere but like I said awkward for parents. The staff was friendly and it was an upscale place with two outside props which were very nice as well. The music was great and excellent for dancing which I love!!!   At 10 they have a 2 for 1 deal on shots. We had 4 fairly large shots and I felt nothing. I haven't drank in a few months so I should have felt them more than I did. Oh and she also charged us for 4 shots, and we reminded her of the special that's run every night."}
{"text":"Alexis V , Brittany, Annabelle, and Brandi were awesome.... Fully recommend El Hefe Tempe."}
{"text":"I've only been here for Happy Hour, so I can't talk about the crazy party atmosphere, which I've heard really good things about.  The service was great when I was there, as were the food and drinks.  Really nice patio to enjoy a relaxing evening with friends."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! This was my first time in AZ, and I wanted to see what AZ had to offer me.. Not only are the bartenders great at El Hefe, but the staff is amazing as well. I came here on a Saturday night, had little to no wait getting in ( we were a group of 8 btw ) the DJ had the crowd going the entire night ( actually having songs you can dance to helps ) He plays quite a bit of variety, so everyone's able to enjoy themselves. I was able to get a bite or two to eat, and the food is great it was really fresh, and didn't feel to heavy, just the perfect type of atmosphere if you're looking to have fun with a group of people, or even stop on by for dinner ( which I might consider next time I come back to AZ) Must admit the lemon drops were the best drink of the night for me! highly recommend making this a stop on your weekend and enjoying both the food, and the club."}
{"text":"Really like this place, as long as you get in early, towards the end of the night is a chaos outside.  Great vibe, gorgeous waitresses and full of college students. Food is good for the cravings of bar snacks.   WARNING, be ready to wait very long time to get your drinks, bar tenders get overwhelmed by the amount of zombies asking for alcohol."}
{"text":"I came here for a late lunch on Cinco de Mayo.  The chips suck 1/5  (I did not try the trio of salsa's, but they looked ok!)  The queso fundido surprisingly good 4/5  Had the three taco combo:  Shredded chicken 4/5 Shrimp 1/5 (inedible super salty) Dont remember the third?? But it was a 2-3/5  Had the cadillac margarita 4+/5  Friend had the fajitas, no complaints!  This place is actually pretty cool for the younger party crowd - next to ASU..."}
{"text":"This place was poppin. Fun crowd, friendly atmosphere and strong drinks. Oh yeah, can't forget about the dimes either. Babes galore."}
{"text":"For granted, a business can let in whoever it wants, but this place is SCOTTSDALE. If you have a vagina, front on line. If your ratio is over 1, front of line. Fuck single guys. Fuck couples. Fuck guys night out. They say it is because all these people are on the guest list. Lol, seriously? Like 50 people went in when I was next in line. No names were checked, nothing. Just go to express line and they were let in.  Worst degree.  I'm fine with VIP line for people who spent $$$ for a table, but this is stupid.  I'm pretty sure I'm going to blacklist this POS Vegas-wannabe club."}
{"text":"Service is always fast and responsive and the tacos are absolutely delicious!   The El Pastor tacos are ridiculously good!!"}
{"text":"This place is my hang out spot. I was the mayor of Hefe on Foursquare for many a months last year. This place is always bumping especially on the weekends, have spent a lot of Sunday Fundays here as well.  Super exciting!"}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun usually. But maybe they shouldn't hire 19 year olds anymore. One girl who worked there last night tried to fight me because I said hi to a guy sitting at the adjacent table, apparently it was \"her man\". I will not be back, absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"Bad enough rating a bar/club. All because of a bad experience with bar tenders. Sunday funday does get packed understandable but ignoring customers because you aren't waving bills (money) in the bar tenders face is not ok. I was literally face to face to with this female African American bar tender for like 10 minutes and she not once asked what'd I'd like to drink, rather she took other people and got herself a drink and checked her phone. That's missed tips on their own behalf, I suppose! Other clubs around get just as packed if not worse and the bar tenders all do great with getting orders out in a timely and friendly manner. Check the staff (bar tenders) Hefe!"}
{"text":"If I could rate this place negative stars I would. From the moment my friend and I walked in to the moment we left, we received nothing but bad service. Very disappointing, when we first walked in we were seated and left without any menus/water/greeting for about 10 mins. I then flagged down the host because still no one had helped us. We ordered chips and salsa, tacos and margaritas. The chips and salsa didn't come out until after we had finished our tacos. Aren't appetizers suppose to come out first? Then when we received our drinks, my friends drink had a hair in it, disgusting. Besides the fact that the tacos took forever we ordered a side of regular fries and they come back with carne asada fries. Overall service sucked and it wasn't even that busy. The tab was on the house but I will NEVER come back to this location, going to the one in Scottsdale from now on."}
{"text":"I visited this place on Easter Sunday night, and this place was packed with bros sporting their best pastels and girls wearing bunny ears. The mission statement of this restaurant is clear, get their customers as drunk as possible and let them do whatever they want. Let off party poppers in the middle of the restaurant, why not? Dance on the table next to customers that are eating, sure! Only visit if you're three sheets to the wind and want to go to a place where no one cares if you embarrass yourself.   They're only getting two stars because the margarita I had was quite good, and I'm picky when it comes to margaritas."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible business. Please don't waste your time or money here. Everything (even happy hour) is ridiculously overpriced for what you get. I'm a light drinker and 2 margaritas didn't even give me a buzz. Tacos are super small and not worth $2 at happy hour pricing. My friend and I sat at the bar and had to flag someone down each time we wanted to order something. I really wish Canteen would have stayed, they were the best. This place sucks and I'll never set foot in there again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Mill Ave. and its atmosphere. This particular bar has changed hands a few times. Now that it's El Hefe, while it does fit the culture of Mill with its laid back patio bar feel and delicious food, the service leaves much to be desired.  My friend and I put our name in for a table but opted for a spot at the bar since we were hungry and wanted to grab a drink while we waited. In the cumulative time we spent waiting for a bartender to even acknowledge us, we could have walked to another bar and been served our drinks and food. I'm not big on \"assuming the position\" as far as it comes to bars (I had a friend once tell me, you have to lean forward and put an arm out to get their attention). Nah; I expect a bartender to do their job and notice someone new and, if not ask if they need something, acknowledge us and say \"I'll be right with you!\" or \"How you doing tonight?\" We received neither. Our bartender was nice enough to exchange my margarita when I discovered I didn't care for it (the Chihuahua isn't all it's cracked up to be; for a Mexican food place, not the best marg I've ever had), but then we waited an eternity to pay our checks.  I would definitely come back for the food, but not for the service or drinks. Nothing impressive about either one. However, knowing there are $2 taco specials, I would probably try to plan ahead next time and order everything in one go, something like this:  :After getting the bartender's attention: Bartender: You ready for some drinks? Me: Actually, we're ready for it all. Can we get two frozen margaritas, four tacos, an order of guac and chips (brought out before tacos please), and the check?  Probably will save us lots of time and trouble next time around, if there is a next time. Too many other great bars and restaurants on Mill may make it tough to give this one another chance."}
{"text":"Twas a tight place. We came here on a Saturday 1/14/2017 and anticipated a lot more people to show up, but it rained so maybe that's why the turnout was smaller than expected.   There were dancers I guess, but as soon as we showed up around 9 PM, they were leaving, which I thought was odd.   We ordered Long Island Iced Tea's. They were good.  Right around that time, people started to line up outside, but again, no dancers and a DJ. Weird. Maybe management didn't anticipate high turnout on a rain day? By then, we left.  Since I didn't stay the full duration til 2 AM, I'm hopeful to try them out a second time. From what I hear, El Hefe has some good tacos. Can't wait to try these, and if the pork al pastor is really, truly \"al pastor\", which I haven't seen in all of Arizona yet, then I'm all in."}
{"text":"Very fun place go and let loose. There are bartenders walking on the bar feeding people shots, a man who looks like Mr. T is also walking around the bar doing beer bongs for free. Very busy on the weekends and a great place to go for happy hour."}
{"text":"The Scottsdaleification of Tempe has begun. Can the moron owners at least think of another concept to put on that corner of Mill rather than your nasty, overpriced and unappetizing food that already exists in Old Town? Apparently, nobody can remember that Tempe is a true college town and we don't want (even if I am not in college) to pay 6 bucks for a beer or 10 bucks for our frozen margarita's. They even charge you for those same lousy chips that they serve at the other location. On my two recent visits, nothing bad happened, the bartender was in a good mood and the servers all are showing off their butts in their workout outfits. El Hefe, the place to get ripped off on Mill, enjoy, but it does have a nice dual patio setup."}
{"text":"Mill Ave. restaurant....meaning I didn't expect much. It was ok. Festive place and probably gets really festive on Fri/Sat.  We went early. Tacos were ok, but the place was too pricey for the food."}
{"text":"Mike and Chelsea were soooo great! They were exactly what you would want representing your business.  Top notch!"}
{"text":"Place for losers. Djs play music from six years ago and the staff are a bunch of tools. If you go here you're a nobody. El Jefe name is a joke!! if you go El Jefe you're a lo life"}
{"text":"With plans to go to Spring Training in full effect, I turned to Living Social and Groupon to find some deals on places to eat nearby and El Hefe was at the top of my list. I went to their site (and Yelp) page and instantly purchased the Groupon voucher. $20 for $40 worth of food and drinks. Unbeknownst to me there are tons and tons of Mexican restaurants in the Scottsdale area and El Hefe was in the middle of a very nice neighborhood full of eateries trying to cash in on Spring Training.   As you approach El Hefe you'll notice their great outdoor patio, perfect for brunch, day drinking, or a refreshing cocktail as the sun sets. We arrived a little before noon on a Saturday, which meant they were offering their brunch drinks. Even before we got inside the trendy taqueria, our eyes gravitated towards an oversized mimosa with a mini champagne bottle coming out of the goblet. After seating ourselves and our attractive waitress introducing herself, I ordered the Bulldog Mimosa for $12 with refills at $0.01!  After milling over the menu for a bit, as well as enjoying my oversized mimosa simultaneously, I ordered the Pollo Parrilla Torta, a Mexican sandwich with grilled chicken breast with a tomato-ancho jam, chipotle mayo, queso asadero, mixed greens, and a bit of lime oil. My party ordered a few high-calorie appetizers that I passed on, in order to enjoy a few of the penny refills. Priorities first.  A few refills later (3 or 4 to be exact) our food came out and the fajitas looked great as did the two tortas we ordered. The bread of the torta was fluffy and sweet and was a striking contrast to what I'm used to but added great dimension to the sandwich. The chicken was equally great and had plenty of flavor all while being moist. All the flavors worked together making it a truly unique Mexican sandwich. I added a bit of hot sauce and the torta was gone before I knew it. I went ahead and tried the steak fajitas ($16) which instantly made me want to order the steak torta. I didn't. I should mention that additional tortillas are $2.  I should mention that the mimosa refills aren't the big, overflowing, jumbo-sized ones but rather the size of a normal cocktail. Nevertheless you can't complain for a penny. The bar staff messed up a few times and I was lucky enough to get varying sizes of the mimosa refills. Service was inconsistent but you couldn't be mad at our friendly waitress, as she was overworked and was servicing every table. You'd think they'd have a full staff ready to go given that it's a Saturday, at 12pm, on gameday.   El Hefe was close to a perfect 5 stars but after some churros that were sent back and a less than helpful manager, as well as the inconsistent service, 4 stars will have to suffice. I will, however, be back next year during Spring Training, especially to try out their tableside beer taps that I didn't have a chance to try out this time around.   Ambiance/Decor: 5/5 Food: 4/5 Service: 3/5 Price: $$ Overall: 4/5  Pros: + Unique taqueria decor (very San Diego) + Patio bar/seating + Large main bar + Spacious dining area/tables + Tableside beer taps! + Oversized drinks w/ refill specials + Tasty tortas and great overall menu + Attractive waitresses and bartenders  Cons: - Additional tortillas run $2 - Inconsistent service - Manager did little to resolve our problem"}
{"text":"I guess I SORTA thought it,was ok, a lot like every other Scottsdale bar, but the vibe was only ok one of the 2 times I went. I like to people watch and noticed you should go with friends if you are under average to average in the looks department. From what I saw the bartenders only give the good service to their friends. We were in a totally sick ride so they liked us fine, I just felt bad for 3 average looking girls that I ended up buying a drink for cause they looked miserable."}
{"text":"Had a bad experience here with an unfriendly staff about 4 months ago, came here recently with a friend for drinks and the experience was much improved. Still can't kick that bitter first impression taste."}
{"text":"This place is cool but it gets PACKED during the weekends so get there early. Its a small place.   We sometimes come here when they have the UFC fights, which is no cover which is a plus. Their beergaritas are great and so are there tacos.   But we usually leave after the fights since you barely have room to breath."}
{"text":"We ate at the Mills St. Tempe Az. location this past weekend. The food & drinks were absolutely amazing!!! Service was superb as well.. Lots of TV's music and a nice big bar. Very open with lots of big windows to people watch! or you can sit in their patio.. This is great casual fun place.  We had the fajitas, and the mole enchiladas. SOOO GOOD!! We will definitely be going back next time we are in Tempe. CAN'T WAIT :-)"}
{"text":"This place was a ---- show. Not very organized or clean and the staff was overtly and unnecessarily rude.   While I thoroughly enjoyed the fact that there was no cover and the drink prices were decent, the negatives definitely outweighed the positives for me, here.   Though this place is quite large, it definitely didn't feel like it. If the bar and patio area was not at capacity, it had to be pretty darn close. I couldn't even lift up my arm to drink my beer because it was either close to being knocked out of my hand or even better, my arms were pinned against a number of sweaty strangers.The music choice was not the best and the layout is generally not friendly to people looking to wander and mingle.   If you don't enjoy being shoved into tiny or poorly lit corners and you dislike pop club remixes of songs, this is definitely not the scene for you. I suggest you get your kicks elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was here for a bachelorette party a couple of weeks ago. The place itself seems alright, but the bathroom attendant is a total hag. My friend and I went to the bathroom early in the night and my friend realized she had gum all over the back of her dress. Another girl in the bathroom suggested we try hair spray. I saw a bottle on the counter and grabbed it to spray on my friend's dress. The bathroom attendant yanked it out of my hand and asked if I had tip money. I told her I unfortunately didn't have cash, but needed to try to get this gum off of my friend's dress. She capped the bottle and told us we couldn't touch it if we didn't have a tip. That's not working for a tip bitch, that's charging people. I have never in my life heard of a bathroom attendant charging people to use things, whether they bring it in or not. I spoke to the guy took care of our reservation, but he didn't seem to care. Great customer service."}
{"text":"Awesome night life experience and always a fun time! El Hefe Tempe is a much better layout than the Scottsdale venue. The tacos are killer and what better of a way to wash them down with one of their great signature margaritas!"}
{"text":"I usually go out to old town about twice a month and can honestly say this is the best bar/club out there. They have an amazing atmosphere and some of the best music around.   I highly recommend this place if you have never been. It never gets old!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. I have never been brushed off by a bartender like I was here. I have never been ignored like I was here. When my friend ordered a vodka-cranberry, and was asked which vodka, she ordered Tito's. The bartender started to pour Grey Goose. Before the bartender had finished pouring the incorrect liqour, my friend corrected her, and she was met with a spiteful gaze and no response. The bartender just made her drink and ignored us.  The floors were absolutely filthy, trash and food was everywhere. I have never been treated as poorly as at el Hefe Scottsdale. I do not plan on visiting any of el Hefe's locations again, after this visit, and I advise all of you to not give el Hefe your business."}
{"text":"This is the hottest spot in town & Taco Tuesdays are legendary but so are their Sundays! Always a good time & if you've never been you should go there tonight! Wednesday nights are insane as well! Definitely the place to be in the nightlife district!"}
{"text":"I finally went there to have a quick drink after a long week at the office. I walked in there and the decor was everything but traditional Mexican. I read some people comparing it to Dia De Los Muertos; somewhat a stretch, but it was cool nonetheless. The coolest feature I found was the beer tap on some of the tables, which gives me an idea of where to take my friends for a night of drunken debauchery. Anyways, I didn't get to eat that time since I already had dinner waiting for me at home,  but the tacos look like the ones I've had in Mexico and the guacamole looked like it is really supposed to look like. I decided to skip the beer tap and ordered a \"Corona Familiar\" , which is a 40 oz  bottle of Corona that until recently it was only sold in Mexico. Anyways, my grand total for my big ass beer bottle; paper bag and all, was $5.00. I will say that I will like to come back for HH, only this time I will make sure to order some duck tacos... Salud!"}
{"text":"Oh El Hefe... it has become one of our new spots to be at all the time.  Its not that the food or drinks are extraordinary but its just the place to be for the moment.  The atmosphere is a lot of fun.  The staff is really friendly and 80% of the time really attentive.  However, it is a very busy place at times so you gotta give them a break.  I've always had a great time here.  Beergaritas are a good deal.  Happy hour and sundayfundays are the best."}
{"text":"The place got renovated a few months ago and although I can't tell any difference, at least the guacamole has been very great. If you check-in on YELP, you can get a free guac and chips appetizer (valued at about 8 bucks). This is very good and traditional guacamole with nice avocado chunks and some queso to boot. The last two times I have been here the Bears have been on TV and this is a Bears bar. Well they lost on Sunday and as a side note how miserable must it be to be a Bears fan for the last 30 years! Not alot of Chicago folks on hand, but enough to know some folks were watching. Too many Bears bars in Phoenix. Anyway, El Hefe is decent to watch football (they have NFL package) and the open air atmosphere means that your right in the mix of the party scene, even at noon on Sunday."}
{"text":"Atmosphere here is nice, live the Dia de Los Muertos theme they have going. Drinks are good, not much on draft but definitely a place where a majority of Scottsdale can get a taste of a variety of Mexican beer. The food, well the Duck tacos although good the menu should have read \"Tapa's\" or appetizer's $4 for 1 baby street taco. Not a good deal, not $4 worth either! If I go back ill make sure to eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night around midnight and there wasn't a cover. This place was PACKED. Felt like I was in a sardine can. If you want to dance, good luck, because the dance floor was crowded the entire night. My friends and I tried dancing, but there simply wasn't enough space so we couldn't enjoy it and went to the patio. The patio was great though, lots of space, seating, and even games. There's this bean bag tossing game at the end of the patio - some guys wanted to play so we split into teams and it was a lot of fun!   I like that there's also girls on the bar that give free shots if you come up and open your mouth. Crazy stuff. Then there's seating inside if you don't want to go to the patio. This place is like a gigantic bar with a tight dance floor, that's the best way to explain it.   The bathroom situation is very unique. So you wait 5-10 minutes in a boys & girls line  and a security guard allows one guy or girl to come in when a guy or girl comes out accordingly, just like the teacher would in elementary school - wait your turn boys and girls! Then, once you're in you have to wait in a normal line at the bathroom stalls. The bathrooms are gross, not polished or clean, just dingy and unkept. There's a giant mirror there though to fix your makeup or check yourself. Then the sinks are outside with soap which is a walkway so that's impractical. And finally, when you're done you're out of that chaos and into the dance floor chaos - one tornado after the other.   Yeah, too crowded for my taste. Also the DJ wasn't very good unless you like oldies and 80's dance and hip hop. It's a nice place to hang out with friends on the patio, but inside the establishment is crazy and definitely not for me."}
{"text":"Great drinks but the doorman didn't let us in with the birthday girl after we went to go elsewhere for the bathroom so we ended up having to pay the doorman $50 for five people! Everyone was kind of upset, won't go again!!"}
{"text":"I prefer the El Hefe on Mill for having more space and nicer staff. This place is pretty packed most of the time with a line that doesn't seem efficiently taken care of. The front men aren't the nicest, and had an affectation of authority, basically they were very pretentious - making them unprofessional. I know people complain about the front men at Maya, but at least they do their job professionally. Also, at Mint, they're very professional as well.   Once inside, it's pretty messy, the crowd and patrons there aren't the ideal crowd you want to be around, neither at the El Hefe on Mill, it must be an El Hefe thing. :P An obnoxious, and irresponsible atmosphere.   The drinks weren't bad though, and the food might be good. Might come back for that."}
{"text":"This a great place to have a couple drinks and some awesome tacos during the day. The food is always fresh, tasty and quick. The prices are a little high, but worth every penny. Try the duck tacos!   As for the nighttime Mill Avenue bar scene, it's usually over-packed (which is something to be said for the awesome atmosphere and prices) but it's almost TOO crowded, which just isn't in my taste. It's definitely a go-to afternoon \"chill spot\".   Awesome bartenders, awesome managers. Keep it up, guys!"}
{"text":"Not allowed in because of shoes? Come on man. The website says casual dress. All these other people are allowed to come in with Sandles, flip flops ect. Smh. This place sucks and I wouldn't recommend to anybody."}
{"text":"WOW.. I did not know this was such as PARTY.   We had planned to eat there and arrived on a Saturday at 5pm. It was PACKED, definitely did not look like dinner was going to be a pleasant experience, and PS. I was not on that level, quite yet. We ate at Majerles (it was ok, review to follow).   Afterwards we came back to Hefe for an after dinner drink. It was a good party. The bar was super busy, and I had one of those moments where I felt like the bartender wouldn't serve me because I was a lady. LOL. Don't you hate that, ladies?   Anyhow, we got our drinks, and we had a few. We watched the fight on the TVs and danced, as the music was pretty GOOD! it was packed though and you had to fight through the crowds to move around. But, still it was a really fun place with good energy and if you're trying to party.. than PARTY!"}
{"text":"I used to come by this place, perfect spot for the college aged type.. but my last visit.... when I was accused of sexual assult!?!?!?! That crossed the line for me.   I can't express in words how much of an issue I have with that, but when I had a security guard separate me and a girl I had been with for a few hours over their speculation, thats one thing.... but the fact that he made a point of making a few smug facial expressions before i left... wow.... how could I not take that as a personal insult. I could care less about being separated. But being tossed into that category of low lifes... how is that not a huge insult to a customer.   I went back to confront them, to tell them that I took issue with the fact that I was accused of such a henious behavior, and they dismissed it as \"dude, get over the fact that you're not getting laid tonight\"  I'll never go here again. I get the sensitivity of sexual assualt, especially around a college campus, but being through it myself, and being accused of it myself almost brought me to tears...   These employees really need to be educated on the issue if they're to continue working here."}
{"text":"This place is like dirty Mexico in the middle of Scottsdale. Not a fan."}
{"text":"Never felt so discriminated in my 25 years in Arizona. The security guard did not allow me and my friend in because we were wearing Jordan shoes and because according to him \"we were too fresh\" but people in line next to us were wearing flip-flops and they were allowed in. Choose your wardrobe carefully when considering this establishment."}
{"text":"This place has surprisingly good food considering it is in the entertainment district (bars and club area). Tacos are inventive but the torta's are my favorite! Marlee and Berlin were very helpful. I had a Red Bull margarita which was great with lunch but let's get real usually it's just tequila shots. This place gets slammed at night."}
{"text":"Came for the Pacquiao / Mayweather fight, so the review is only as good as that crazy event. Staff were easy to get along with, pleasant, and the best part of the evening was the crazy good food (watching two elderly men fight was just \"okay\"). Seriously, the guacamole was insanely good, the corn cheese dip was good, and the tacos were tasty tasty. If the food was this good on a fight night, I can imagine the amazing delicacies coming out of the kitchen when the staff isn't busy trying to serve hundreds of people at the EXACT same time.   Great food, fun activities, and great scenery!"}
{"text":"Great tacos.  Good energy and a personable and outgoing waitstaff."}
{"text":"The tacos I ordered here at happy hour - fried avocado, carne asada, and pastor - were very good, the most enjoyable for me being the fried avocado. The tortillas were piled high with filling, making for messy but fun eating. Service was very friendly and the place had the typical noisy energy of a sports bar in a college town. The only issue here for me is the same for any establishment in the Mill Avenue - namely, finding a place to park is quite a challenge."}
{"text":"This place was awesome . Hip hop & techno basically ...a young crowed with a lot of cuties.  Most definitely will go back...pretty decent size dance floor"}
{"text":"Well i luv the food but trying to get a table is crazy.. There are empty tables but said there is a 20 min wait???  Hmm ok then over 20 min waiting still empty tables wtf is going on with this place."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon  - almost impossible to get a drink.  The bartenders are too busy talking on their cell phones instead of helping a full bar of frustrated patrons.  Had to ask 3 different times for 2 beers before someone actually brought them.  There were also some strange smells if vomit and fish in certain areas.  Also, THEY DO NOT WASH THEIR GLASSES. We saw someobe bring out a brand new box of glasses, open it and then place the glasses under the bar. One of the bartenders grabbed a cup directly from the box, filled it with beer and then gave it to a customer!   So gross will never go back."}
{"text":"I ordered the tinga quesadilla: not impressed at all!!! Avoid this! Just order regular drinks. I do not recommend the Chelada drinks either! It tasted like watery beer. In the beginning they served the beer and they didn't tell us that they were out of  tecate beers, so they decided to serve the Chelada (that goes with tecate beer) with dos Equis. I noticed when the bartender was serving the beer and asked her, then she had to agree with me. Sneaky bartender!!!! Check your drinks specially if you order the good ones!"}
{"text":"My favorite club in Old Town. Their tacos are supreme. We had Kassie as our server for bottle service and she was awesome! I will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"People talk about the fun & nightlife at this bar. Which is excellent. However El Hefe has the best Gourmet tacos I have ever had anywhere in AZ. All the other food is excellent as well. Go on Taco Tuesday for $2 tacos and thank me later. Great place to watch sports at. Thanks for all the good food, hot girl visuals, pumping bass EDM music, and of course the tasty tacos!"}
{"text":"I'm giving 2 stars TO THE FOOD ONLY. And the busboy.   First of all, how in Pete's name do you get in this place? Oh there's an opening.. I think. Okay made it to a table. Where's the waitress? There's like 5 surrounding the POS station and bar but none seem concerned with seating us. Oh here's someone. A busboy perhaps?   We are finally seated. Drinks. Menu. Hmm, everything looks pretty good. Decently priced. We order chips and salsa. Comes out in a few minutes by the busboy who also sat us and took our drink order. The presentation is nice. Three small jars of various salsas with a plate of chips. Very light tortilla chips and they're good. Salsa is as well.   So we order... I'm thinkin,' \"man this place is huge and there seem to be way too many staff for how empty the place is but that means more attention, right?\" My empty cup says otherwise. Here comes the food. Kind of felt like it took a while, but again presentation looks good and I can't wait to eat.   Accurate assessment about the food. My chicken torta is really good. Bf says his is too. My fries look amazing. They have this cream drizzle and little shavings of green onion on top. Noms for days. Oh hell no, they're f$*^ing cold. And stiff and taste like cold gross potatoes. Awesome.   Where's the waitress? Oh there's one. Wait she's \"assigned\" to the other table. I watch her literally make eye contact with my bf's empty cup and walk away. I'm steaming hotter than my lame ass fries at this point. I finish half of my torta. Okay, we need a box. Then a homeless(?) kid comes up and asks for money. No but you can have the fries (with  face) Okay cool, he's down. Enjoy bro. I almost felt worse giving him the fries. He was grateful though. So win-win.   Anyway where the F is the waitress? I'm not even thirsty anymore. Like I don't want to even wait for her to come ask if we need more drinks to then watch her disappear and never be seen again. Then guess who comes back around. My favorite person in the world, the busboy. Can we have a box? Thanks. Bf walks up to pay cause I have shit to do today and have spent too long here already. ByeeeFelicia.   Had high hopes for this place. Food was sort of good but the service was horrible. Hospitality should be more of a focus. Damn if a place like that can survive just because of the bar and its location, I might as well try my hand at becoming a restauranteur too. Would never eat here again."}
{"text":"food ok a little pricey but good. it is probably a better spot if you like to drink"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. I was asked to leave for sending a text message to my girlfriend. I'm not exaggerating, my friends and I paid for bottle service and a table ( $300, by the way) and after having a fun time, not being rude or in any way breaking any club rules, I was asked to leave because I was taking a second to breathe and sending a text to my girlfriend, I have never felt so disrespected and cheated by a nightclub. I cannot in good conscience recommend this place to anyone from Phoenix or visiting. TERRIBLE service and extremely rude staff."}
{"text":"good service, nice size carne asada tacos!  magarita was okay not amazing, could've used less juice and more alcohol..but I'm not the bartender here.   Didn't see the price, but $2 tacos on Tuesday and a $8 degree Margarita in the middle of downtown tempe is alright w/me!  Ill come back here and continued to bring outta-town friends.. 4 STARS"}
{"text":"I've eaten at most of the restaurants in downtown Tempe so I believe I have a good understanding of what's good and what's not when it comes to food, drinks and service.   El Hefe is one of those places where the food, atmosphere and service is consistently good. Of course you must enjoy Mexican food. And I do. Their tacos are flavorful and nicely presented on wooden serving trays. The food usually arrives before the first sip of beer is done.   The staff is very friendly. I'm greeted with smiles and hello's when ever I show up...which is frequent...precisely because of the exceptional service I receive. Any problems are handled promptly and without fuss. They clearly want a happy customer.  Kudos to Brandi, Hailey, Bella, Candace, Marissa, Brittini, Daney, Austin, Jamie, Marcel, Alexis...and others for great service.  I highly recommend it for the food and atmosphere...it's festive and fun. But what makes El Hefe the El Chingon...are the beautiful souls that work there.   One more thing...it turns into a totally insane nightclub after 10 pm...a bit much for this old dog...but for the young at heart it's one rocking affair."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today, I was immediately greeted by bartender Mike Babin who recommended I try their \"SuperMacho Bowl\". It was a great choice, very healthy and tasted great! I also then tried the House Margarita which went very well with the meal he recommended I try. Overall I would definitely come back again to this place! Thanks for the great service Mike!"}
{"text":"My favorite bar to go to in Old town!! If you are looking for a crowd and a great place to spend your \"Sunday Funday\" This is without a doubt the place to go! Also a great \"beergarita\""}
{"text":"Went there last night and it was so much fun! For a Friday night at 12am the bar gets very busy and somewhat loud. The bartenders were very fast at getting my drinks and the bartender \"Brittany\" was very nice and had a big smile the whole time. I normally don't like bars like this because it is Not my sene , but this bar was actually fun and a must go back! Thanks."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon to try out El Hefe..note I am past the club age and honestly I was a little unsure of the place. We went on a Saturday afternoon around 1pm, parked right in front and was told we could sit anywhere.  Not a huge place by any means as all the booths were full, so we sat at a high top table. The place has a bar feel but that was to be expected.  I got a margarita,  the one with the OJ and Grand Marnier, it was really good (I will admit to preferring frozen) but this on the rocks version was tasty. The drink was $10 but it was rather large so worth the price. We then ordered the queso fundido, oh my one of the best I have had. It came with great chips with sea salt and five of their little tortillas.  Both the husband and I ordered the three taco plate, I hate the braised beef, duck carnitas and the mushroom taco. All pretty good, the husband got pork al pastor (his favorite), chicken tinga and the cod. He also loved the corn that came as the side. The cilantro rice I barely ate. All inall we will be back and I am goinf to try their nachos, they looked amazing. We definitely will also order less due to sheer size but had to order at least $40 for the groupon. Great deal. Now this location is in the heart of old town Scottsdale and is across from Whiskey Row so be aware of the scene. But they have a Tempe location. We will definitely be back for lunch and some more of those yummy margaritas. I love trying new places through Groupon."}
{"text":"Doing errands in the area and stopped here for lunch.  What a great place! Perfect place to watch sports, final 4 basketball on the big screens while we were here.  They turned music on during the break.  Service was nice, even down to bus boy who we chatted up. Tacos were amazing! I had the braised pork shoulder al pastor and my partner had the beef cheek which were recommended by the bus boy.  Beef cheek tacos all the way! I'm sure this place gets crazy packed at night, which isn't for me. Lunch? Anytime for this mid 30 something."}
{"text":"if you want douches and crap service then El Hefe is your spot. Two years ago this was a rotation nightout spot for friends and I, so, I never had the chance to try out the place during early evening hours for food and drink. Fast forward to recently, seeing that Hi-Fi Kitchen across the street was ridic crowded compared to not as busy El Hefe, a friend and I decided to stop by for a drink and a snack. Upon entering we were told by one of the server/hostess girls to pick a table or sit at the bar. We both wanted to sit outside but saw all their high tops were taken and reluctantly sat at the bar. After a few mins, while waiting to order drinks, a table emptied out, and we snatched it up and this is where they get a one star.   Personally they do a good job as a bar in old town during the weekends, they play okayish dance music, it's loud, it's happening, it's relevant. They have the douches out to play and they keep the nighttime masses liquored up BUT that's it. Service wise they fail miserably. As we sat at our table, we waited, and waited, and waited so more. There was a server who went by us to attempt to clean up (attempt because she didn't do much) another vacated table, she passed us yet again to check on another table, and passed us yet again just walking by. She could clearly see that we were sitting there with two menus, looking at it, and now bored looking at our phones, and not ONCE did she take the courtesy to stop by and offer a drink order or water. NOTHING. Let me add, it's a bit disconcerting as a customer when you hear the bar staff express concern that Hi-Fi seems really busy across the street while they talk about their lack of business on their side. With servers that do not provide service I can see why you ought to be worried.   I'm a patient person, and I give props to good service where due but our last straw occurred when a group of girls (six in all) showed up, walked in a grabbed a table behind us on the patio, and lo behold, the SAME SERVER, walks up and assists them, hands out menus, and turns around and ignores us yet again. WTF?!? We got up, we walked out. I saw the manager and felt the need to express my disgust at what I witnessed, maybe I didn't express myself clearly but he didn't seem to care much either. We walked out."}
{"text":"I'm a new Scottsdale transplant, and although clubs aren't really my scene, I figured I should try Saturday night at oldtown at least once. I stopped in a few before coming here - Bottled Blonde and Hi Fi were alright. Unlike the others, there was a line here, and honestly I'm not sure why so many people feel the need to cram themselves into this abrasive venue.   My main complaint has to do with the sound levels. Although I was only there for ~15 min, my ears were ringing painfully when I left, and an hour or so later that developed into muffled/distorted hearing. Twelve hours later the next day, the tinnitus is still very present, and this is just from 15 minutes inside. It's beyond me how some people can frequent this venue every weekend or stand around with their drinks right in front of the massive tower speakers. The tinnitus will fade eventually, but I don't doubt I earned some irreversible nerve fiber damage. And I hope the lingerie-wearing bartender/stripper hybrids (apparently a thing in oldtown, just a side note because I think it's the most classic oldtown Scottsdale thing ever) at least have some hearing protection going on because they won't be hearing anything in a year otherwise.   I understand this is a nightclub, and aggressively loud music is par for the course. But this venue specifically went way overboard, and I'm certain they did no technical sound level testing during setup, such as at the maximum point when the sound waves from the speakers intersect basically right in front of the bar. I wouldn't be surprised if it was 150 dB there, when 85 is all you need for permanent damage."}
{"text":"Beware for whatever reason the doorman would not let me in because I had the wrong type of shorts. Everybody and their grandma was there but I was not allowed in. Really? On Mill Avenue especially???  Get a life"}
{"text":"Waitresses were dressed in small underoos which was a little much but whatever. The margaritas were delicious and strong, especially the one with the upsidedown brewski. I also had the skinny margarita and it was alright. They have a good happy hour menu. Atmosphere is meant to look badass with black paint and skulls. We sat on patio and people watched everyone on busy Mill Street. Some punk tried to smoke a cig next to us and it was blowing my way. I had to tell him to book it. Overall though, enjoyable place filled with college aged students and adults alike. If I lived in Tempe, I'd be back again and again."}
{"text":"Good service and atmosphere but... Drinks were overpriced and really watered down. No buzz off giant marg!!"}
{"text":"I had only been to this place one time, I used to like it until this past Saturday.  We had table reservations for 15 people for a friends birthday, they told us reservations would be at 7 and once we got there they said we had to wait until 8.  We finally got seated in the couch/lounge area by the second bar (the smaller one) and we were having a good time ordering drinks and food.  Some of us had separate tabs but everyone had drinks flowing, I would say we spend at least $1,200 in the 3 hours that we were there.  We planned on staying here the whole night when out of no where a low budget bus boy comes and says we have to clear the space.. why? I don't know.  He literally came by and told we didn't have to leave the bar but the spot needed to be cleared off.  We tried talking to a guy who I was assuming was some sort of manager and he completely wrote us off, it was this bald short stumpy green eyed guy.  Needless to say this place used to be fun for me.. but once we had this happen Saturday I will NEVER go back again and will totally take my business elsewhere.  Talk about having bad customer service... if you wan to be treated like crap then be my guest and see for yourself."}
{"text":"What is the 3% \"tech fee\" added to the bill?  Came here for happy hour and it is a fun college spot, good deals on tacos and an enjoyable happy hour margarita. Fun atmosphere and makes a good happy hour spot... but why the surprise 3% fee at the end in addition to the tax? Can't they just include it in the meal price up front? Makes businesses seem a little shady when they do this."}
{"text":"The atmosphere on a spring break Saturday night was electric. Televisions showing March Madness And USA  baseball. The bar tenders served drinks quickly while we waited to be seated. We sat within 20 minutes. Ordered Carne Asada and Mahi Mahi tacos. Also ordered chips salsa with guacamole. The food was delicious and the service was prompt and friendly. Recommend this place when in Tempe."}
{"text":"It was alright.  The drinks and food were pretty good.  The decor was a bit unusual; skate boards and graffiti type art.  Nothing wrong with it, just not exactly what I was expecting from a place called \"El Hefe\".  Anyway, in short, it is your typical Scottsdale bar, college students and cougars.  Not my normal scene, but fun if you want a good drink and do some people watching."}
{"text":"I can mostly understand the draw of El Hefe as a goto for ASU students.  Big expansive sports bar with a lengthy drink menu and friendly staff.  That said, eating here can feel like eating at Hooters (except with Mexican as the food theme).  Take that depiction however you wish, but I'm sure you can conjure up the appropriate (or inappropriate) imagery.  Regardless, I was invited here to hang out with some fellow Yelper buds during happy hour during a Thursday.  Fortunately we came just before the school year and thus didn't have to fight the ASU crowd.  Let's get to it.  Riot Hospitality Group is the brains behind El Hefe along with other valley restaurants such as Dierks Bentley's Whiskey Row, Farm & Craft, and Hand Cut.  El Hefe's Tempe location lies right on Sixth Street just west of Mill on the southwest corner.  The restaurant can pack in somewhere between 100-150 people at full capacity with two fully stocked bars (one inside and one on the patio outside) and plenty of TVs at the bar, near the tables, and even above the urinals in the men's restroom (can't speak to the women's restroom for obvious reasons).  I can imagine this place jumping during the weekends when school is in session and especially on football game days.  As others have accurately pointed out, El Hefe does honor the free guac and chips check in offer (but beware only one per table).  So we got one of those to share.  The guac and salsas were fine, but nothing out of the ordinary.  Same goes for the chips.  For my main dish I was looking for something that might stand out above the usual Mexican fare that I would expect to find.  The Enchilada Blanco seemed like just such an intriguing complex dish.  Three enchiladas stuffed with pulled chicken and queso asadero.  The enchiladas are then topped with salsa roja, queso fresco, lime crema, and a white sauce I couldn't quite put my finger on.  Also came with a side of rice.  I was mostly happy with the enchiladas, though honestly I felt they could've put a little more chicken inside.  That said, I was pretty impressed with the different flavor combinations they integrated into this dish.  The rice on the other hand was super dry.  I'm guessing it was rice that cooked hours ago and sitting underneath a heat lamp.  To wash down the food, I got their house margarita which was discounted for happy hour.  I'd say the margarita was passable, but perhaps a little too sweet for my taste.  For dessert, I saw an item that had me written all over it.  I love horchata and I love milkshakes.  So naturally a Horchata Milkshake sounded magical.  I guess I didn't know what to expect it to look like so it was a little surprising when it came in a standard water glass, but the taste was unmistakably that of a milkshake blended with horchata (probably quite literally in a blender).  Tasty, smooth, and not too heavy.  Not a bad finisher.  Total cost for the entree, two drinks, tax and tip came to about $30.  As I write this, El Hefe fetches an average of 3 stars.  That's pretty much spot on based on my experience.  The food here is better than Hooters or Tilted Kilt based on my experience, though perhaps not as good as...say...Twin Peaks.  Measuring up El Hefe versus other valley Mexican restaurants doesn't really seem fair as they're not really trying that hard to be authentic to that degree.  But again, if you're in the ASU crowd and looking for a fun gathering space for a drink, this would be an attractive option.  As for the food, well, just don't expect anything in the same league as a Barrio Cafe or a Carolina's."}
{"text":"Always a good time and good people... it isn't as good and fun as the Scottsdale location, but it's okay because that one is temporarily closed for remodel."}
{"text":"This place is garbage. A few months ago, I was there on a Sunday evening having a few drinks and what not. Out of no where, two Mexican chicks and two white chicks are being dragged out of the bathroom by the neck! . The bouncer kept grabbing and groping her on the way out, not to mention that he had her in a full choke hold and she looked like she was ready to pass out. As I am sitting outside, the fat bastard, racist son of a bitch fuck starts making unnecessary comments. He started calling the poor chick a heifer, a beaner, a wetback on other things. I was offend and  called him out, to which he told me to shut the fuck up or leave if I didn't like it. After all, this is \"El Hefe, Super macho taqueria\" priding themselves on Mexican food and drinks. I think it was bull shit so I told the guy to let go of the girl and he said that I could go back to Mexico with them. I closed out my tab, they called the cops, i think one of the girls got arrested and I never heard back from the manager after I emailed him. The owners might have the best intentions, but staff and management run this place like they own it. Bunch of lame ass bouncers making 10 bucks an hour on a power trip. I might have not gotten a table there that night but I had before. Either way, my tab was about 200 bucks plus tip, which I think would be enough to pay for the bastards salary for a month.   I wrote this review because i was there this past weekend. I looked over at HiFi and saw that there wasn't too much activity, so i decided to give El Hefe a try and get a table there instead. I was disgusted to see this idiot working there, so I went back to HiFi and had a great time there. I REALLY hope that management sees this review and they take action."}
{"text":"Great place for a night out on the weekends. Thomas Lawson is an excellent VIP host and always goes out of his way to make sure you have an awesome night! I frequently get tables here because of the exceptional service I receive. Not to mention the DJ is always on point!"}
{"text":"I mostly go here for Sunday Funday or on weekend nights and have a good time. It gets busy and trying to get a drink can be vexing at times, but that comes with the territory. Most of the time I have a pleasant experience. But, the last time I came in, I did not enjoy myself nearly as much. I came in with three friends, and they did not have any tables inside, so we decided to sit on their patio which was very hot (not their fault, damn this weather). At first we tried to track down a server, but were unable to, so we ordered drinks from the bar. This took a very long time, and the bartenders seemed more interested in talking to each other than serving patrons. It was relatively busy, but waiting fifteen minutes is a bit much to ask. Finally, once we got our drinks we grabbed a couple menus and were finally able to track down a server. It seemed like she was the only server for the entire restaurant. We ordered our food and it came out in around 20-25 minutes. The food was pretty good, but when my girlfriend asked for her tab she was given the wrong credit card. It then took another fifteen minutes to track down the server again, and she gave her the right credit card back. She wasn't exactly friendly. I'll be back because I like this place, just not to sit down and eat.  4 stars at night 1.5 stars for lunch"}
{"text":"Apparently footware is very important if you decide to patronize this establishment.  We were turned away because members of our party were wearing \"Jordan shoes\" I'm assuming this is some sort of an act of discrimination.   I will tell you this; I will reach out to the owner to describe my discontent.  In the long game though, they won't be in business for long so I'm not sure how much it matters."}
{"text":"Ok I'm not one to bitch or complain but el hefe was awful. I'm a bartender myself and I'm usually pretty understanding and like to give people the benefit of the doubt but I've never received such awful service in my life. My gf and I sat at the bar, ALL of the bartenders were very inattentive. The best service I received was from the expos. My tacos came out wrong, they reordered them and the new ones came out quickly but the meat was burnt and I had to send them back once more. The bartenders weren't paying any attention so it took three times longer than it should have. I ordered a margarita with no sweet and sour, the bartender gave me a super confused look. I told him specifically tequila, lime juice, agave and soda and he still gave me a confused look with some attitude. Once I received the margarita i tasted it and it wasn't the best but I was so over complaining that I sucked it down anyways. There was a female bartender working also and disregarded my gf and I but was paying attention to all of the male patrons. I don't ask for a lot, I just want good service. If the service was good I probably wouldn't have even complained about the tacos. They would have received at least three stars if the service would have been decent but unfortunately it was the worst service I've ever received and that says a lot since I come from the same industry and I'm usually very understanding. Monty in particular was the one giving us the worst service. He didn't bother to check on us once. It took over ten minutes to close out my tab and the only reason it didn't take longer was because one of the new female bartenders who had just clocked on was nice enough to ask how I was doing and she closed out my tab. The service was awful the food was ehh and I won't be coming back the next time I visit Tempe."}
{"text":"I have generally been a big fan of El Hefe for a while - I would eat lunch there on my break, attend happy hours and head out there for a night on the town. Back in those goo days I would have rated this place at 4 stars. But the last few times I have been here to go out, the guy bartenders have acted like the roided out frat bros they truly are. Not only have I been overcharged for drinks two weekends in a row, but when I confronted the bartender about it this time he started yelling and cursing at me in front of my two friends (I bought 3 drinks) about how wrong I was. Bad experience to say the least.   The only reason this place isn't a 1 star business now is because the front door man Taylor is a class act and a true professional when dealing with issues as opposed to the primal animals behind the bar. He is the only reason my friends and I might come back in the future."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this SHITTY place 0 stars!! They make you wait in line for 20 minutes until you get in and see its EMPTY!! They do it just for show!! What a joke!!! How pathetic!! All 21 year old douche bags and nothing more in this place! Crappy music and watered down drinks. Such a disappointment! Don't waste your time!! Your night will be ruined like mine!"}
{"text":"Hi thanks for having AWESOME security guards that don't take sexual assault or the way women are treated in the bar scene lightly, unlike CASA the security  here is actually competent"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check this place out, but its in Scottsdale and that's not usually where I go out. Last night we ended up here after going to a couple other bars in Oldtown.  It was pretty packed and we had to wait outside for like 10 minutes before they let us in but it was worth it.  The first thing we noticed when we walked in was Steve Nash chilling with some guys. I wouldn't have expected him at a place like this but it was really cool. They also had Mr. T upstairs dancing with a bunch of women.  Drinks are cheap. We got a couple mixed drinks and a couple beers for $14. Bartenders are cute and friendly from what I saw.  They had two girls up on the bar with a beer bong and I thought that was awesome. I didn't participate, but it was fun watching other people do it.  We got there kind of late, so it ended up clearing out a little bit and we were able to get our grove on. The whole vibe of the place was just really cool. I ended up having a blast here and I'm definitely planning on going back next weekend!"}
{"text":"Try ran out of champagne for the $0.10 mimosa refills. As a result of this they told us they would comp us a round of drinks. The service was extremely slow and when the bill finally came they did not comp the drinks they said they would and added 20% gratuity for our party of six. We asked to speak to a manager and no one ever came except the server. I don't have a problem with gratuity included, however if you're going to add 20% to the bill I expect speedy service and a manager to come to our table when requested."}
{"text":"LOVE IT! Great happy hour... great atmosphere... and great service!  Only been here once but loved it and am planning on doing my birthday here forsure!"}
{"text":"Went to this place on a random Wednesday night. Ordered some amazing nachos and bomb adios MoFos, next thing I know it was a party. Had a great time!"}
{"text":"Hailey, our bartender completely made this place amazing! She was so friendly, nice and relatable.  The food was amazing, we had chips w/ guac and queso along with the fried avocado taco which was to die for. My boyfriend preferred the carne asada over the chicken but both were good.. we will absolutely be back next time we come to Scottsdale!   The only complaint I have is that none of the bathroom stalls had toilet seat covers which was gross but that's fixable."}
{"text":"We went during spring break early, around 5:30 and be warned, you must have an upright picture license for the over 21 year old if you want to have a drink.  Even if you are over 21 but have an old license you acquired before you were 21, they WILL NOT accept these all up and down Mill Street.  Our daughter is over 21 but had an old license.  We came in the front (there is also a side patio entrance) that is just a gate door, but there was no hostess so we seated ourselves in the patio.  We had to move some plates and drinks from the previous patrons to another dirty table and waited a long time but finally we had a friendly server.  We had beers, and appetizers, it was happy hour and the appetizer were $1 off.  I had the fish tacos and my husband had the beef.  He was really sick for the next two days and he thought it was from the tacos.  My son had the chicken and he was fine.  The food was nothing special.  It has a nice patio where you can watch all the people (and homeless folks) but I would plan my meals somewhere else and just go here for a drink next time."}
{"text":"Food was good. Happy hour prices reasonable. Service was below average from the waitress. Hostess and food runners were on point."}
{"text":"El Hefe's Tempe is in my opinion as well as my buddies the best bar in Tempe!  Great atmosphere and staff specifically Alexis Cherry (yes her real name). Highly recommend stopping in and I'm enjoying the SIGHTS as well as the great food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We stopped in Friday night for dinner after learning Pedal Haus was closed for a private event.  I had only ever had drinks at the El Hefe in Scottsdale, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  The food was surprisingly good - we tried the super macho bowls with shrimp and combo meats and the chicken enchiladas.  Our server was very nice and took good care of us, but it seemed weird that we had to wait nearly 20 minutes for table on a Friday night when plenty of tables were available - who knows?!?"}
{"text":"The adults roam during the day while the kids play out at night. When I see people in suits and dress attire lunching in a restaurant with servers in shorts with butt cheeks hanging out, it's awkward and tacky. You would think that for El Hefe providing a full menu and bar for both day and night, there is a time and place for how you present yourself for various settings, but it was laughable witnessing what I could easily see in a night out at old town during the day.   I came in during lunch hour. It was not rushed/busy/etc. But you can tell there were a decent amount of guests lunching during their lunch break from work. Our waitress had a really hard time cracking a smile and could not fathom expressing the slightest friendliest tone. My girlfriend and I were actually laughing at the face expression she had when she advised us our food is on it's way as if it was a huge convenience actually doing her job. I haven't seen anything this comical in a business standpoint in years.   The tacos I had were not that great. Unfortunately, the 2 carne asada tacos I tasted were room temp, stiff cold un cooked/warmed tortillas with bland flavor. I did, however, enjoy the fried avocado taco. I barely ate my third taco. I was not impressed and therefore hungry a little later and had an early dinner.  I would say my experience is better in the nighttime where hot bartenders are slinging drinks at a fast pace, great music, crowd etc. But during the day time, it was a blah experience. I loved the environment, to which all the windows were open and you got to enjoy the daylight,fresh air, etc. So the environment is great, but vibe is just okay. Perhaps it was just my first day time experience, but it could have been better."}
{"text":"Keeping it short and sweet...good for drinking with your amigos. food is eh...Service was prompt and oh so friendly"}
{"text":"Danny the bar back, most productive person here, great service, and got what we needed faster than the others who disregarded our request. Otherwise, great environment:)"}
{"text":"What a greet experience this evening at el hefe. Six dollar quesadillas and five dollar beer margaritas!! And the service was outstanding. Our server \"L\" was amazing and so sweet. We will be back next spring :)"}
{"text":"Whenever I head to mill the first place I stop at is Hefe. I always go there because I love the music. Not only is the music good, but the food there is awesome. You wouldn't expect a bar to have good quality food but I would totally recommend the chicken tortilla soup!!! The place is always fun and happening even during the week. They also have corn hole in the back which is always fun to get a group to play. Least to say, Hefe is the one spot you should hit every time you head to mill. Bring a bunch of friends because it'll call for a good night!"}
{"text":"If nothing else, the pork belly tacos are to DIE for  the chips and salsa are also amazing- favorite day drinking spot for sure"}
{"text":"This place was the hottest and sweatiest bar I've ever been to. As usual, the girls in Scottsdale are hotter than the guys. Their drinks were alright. I have not tried the food yet. It was so hot and sweaty in there that I probably wouldn't come back. I have never danced with so many ugly men in one night."}
{"text":"Great tacos with a lot of meat (I had duck), kind of pricey at $4 a taco but they're filling so I just one and I was good! Get the salsa verde it's incredible!!"}
{"text":"Not one of my favorite clubs to go to. lousy service, and overpriced drinks, Unless you get a table you're screwed. So packed and filled with douchebags and everyone tries to fight down there, not fun. I'm good on going back"}
{"text":"El hefe is one of my most favorite places to go in old town! They remodeled the entire place and it's so much better! The food there is also really good. It's a wild time here so if you're ready to get crazy, this is your place to go !"}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the past two days, both times for the tacos if that says anything. Their carne asada tacos are the best in Tempe. I've tried else where but nothing compares :-))   So the food is great and of course the drinks are great, one thing though, and I totally understand this is a bar but I think the bartenders could be dressed a little tiny bit classier. Everyone's great though, and really nice. I'm going to check out the Scottsdale location :-)"}
{"text":"Will never come to this location again. Waited 10 min sitting at the BAR for a drink!!! Than the \"bartender\" was insulting to me. He decided to tend to ONLY my girl and didnt bother to look at me or ask what I wanted to order. I ended up not ordering anything after him asking me about 15 min after my girl ordered.  The service sucked at this location!!  I love the food. But please train the employees better."}
{"text":"This place deserves 0 stars WOW, this had to be THE worst experience I've ever had in any type of customer service environment. First of all, I shouldn't have to get up more than once to have a request fulfilled. We came with a party of 4, ordered a few margaritas, 2 appetizers and 2 tacos. We literally waited 45 minutes to get our stuff and only AFTER we told the waitress and manager a handful of times. We never even got our tacos, we were just fed up and left. Next time you want something done right at this place, don't waste your time. Go to the Scottsdale location, this ones a joke."}
{"text":"brunch here and happy hour is awesome. At night it turns into your stereotypical Scottsdale d-bag watering hole. Among the sea of roid raged bros with overly gelled hair and drenched in Armani cologne, will you occassionally spot a pretty waitress dancing upon the bar, with a tequila bottle in her hand ready to pour into your mouth."}
{"text":"I use to like this place when it was the Canteen the music was great, atmosphere was chill, and it was a good place to dance until they turned it into el hefe and tired to turn it into Scottsdale in Tempe! now its overcrowded, bouncers are jerks and racist, drinks are pricey, you can't dance anymore because its overcrowded, and the food sucks. I use to go in there but its pack with mostly with horny dudes and its hard to even get a drink in a 10 min time frame. plus if your not white or a chick they won't let you in because they will find an excuse to not let you in after waiting in line for like 30 mins! I don't recommend this bar unless your white and your jeans are girl jeans tight because the bouncers are horrible and are racists just because the color of the skin. I notice they let white people in with shorts, tanks, basketball shoes, jerseys, and baggy pants but minorities are more restrict because they don't like them in there Establishment."}
{"text":"this place is packed, drink lines are long but cheaper compared to others, its loud, and dancers are hot its a great place to go when your about 5 drinks in if your sober you will probably walk right on out but overall a pretty cool place."}
{"text":"After a lame experience at Smashboxx next door we came here and guess what?  the bouncers weren't douchebags--yayy!  I came here buzzed and left druuunk. I came here \"thirsty\" and left satisfied. I came here wanting to dance and left tired. I came here wanting some good music and left happily with my ears ringing.  The music was awesome, and the last half hour or so the dj played some dubstep (skrillex, and I think benga), to which people either went \"wtf\" or \"woo!\" about....Me and the \"woo!\" crew had a good ol time."}
{"text":"El Hefe Tempe has it going on. Like my review of the Scottsdale location, this is a lunch time review.  My friend and I sat at the bar and ordered lunch from the menu. The bartender was HOT and really smart and funny. She even showed me how to make one of their signature drinks when I asked about it.  With regard to the food, it is probably better than Scottsdale, somehow. I had the mole enchiladas and they were incredible. I've had many different kinds of mole, including super authentic Queretaro style. This was very well crafted and better than any that I've had.   My friend had a variety of street tacos and loved them."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for taco Tuesdays! Fried avocado and pork tacos are to die for and at only $2 a pop! They aren't that crazy busy around lunch time and are usually pretty quick about getting food and drinks out. I always feel welcomed in and treated with respect, receive exceptional service and leave feeling full."}
{"text":"Went to El Hefe for the first time tonight. Meet a friend for Happy Hour and stayed longer than I expected, because I was having such a good time. Bartendress Taylor was super attentive. She highly recommended the Fried Avocado Taco. Tried it & loved it. Great alternative for vegetarians (or anybody else). Manager Sonny could not have been more customer service oriented. We bugged him to let us watch the Presidential Debate on one of the TV's at the bar. He worked it out and we watched the whole thing from the comfort of our bar stools."}
{"text":"This is one of Scottsdale's new hot spots. If you like the 'Scottsdale' scene, this place is a must. Sunday the music goes off as Thomas James spins sic house beats and the bar serves up $2 tacos. On the weekends, it is still the hot new local spot so it is always busy. Fun place to go and usually there is great eye candy."}
{"text":"The tacos were great, don't get me wrong... but check out the receipt: $.25 for no onions on them? Why am I paying for something they're not putting on it?!? And then a \"Tech Fee 3%\"?!?! WTF is a tech fee?? According to the bartender it's the fee to run your card. So do you get this removed when you pay cash then? I'm confused. And full of tacos."}
{"text":"I love this place. I come here whenever I'm in town for business. The taco Tuesday deals are unbelievably amazing. The tacos are only two dollars each, but they could be charging much more for the quality that they are. They also have a good IPA on tap that is only five dollars a pint. All of the staff is incredibly nice and they have great music here too. I also love the fact that there's tons of monitors everywhere so you can see games from every angle of the venue. They also have a great outdoor seating area that is right on the sidewalk and located on a busy downtown corner which suits all the people watchers well."}
{"text":"I'm not sure about the rest of the comments but my whole table was colored and we got in just fine and got good deals on bottle service 2 nights this week(Thursday and Saturday). The DJ was good and our service was great both nights. They had to move our table on Thursday night but actually comped us another bottle so no big deal. Can't comment on the food though cause all we had was drinks."}
{"text":"so far so good. having dinner, drinks and football! first time here. I like the open outdoor area."}
{"text":"Hubs-  Was walking and shopping Mill Ave. with the girls on a Sunday afternoon and decided to try this place out.  Kayla A. was our server and was very polite and friendly.  Around 2:00pm the place was not crowded and family friendly.  Ordered an assortment of tacos and all were delicious.  Outside of typical party hours we'd definitely bring kids back.  We will definitely be back to check out the evening hours kidless."}
{"text":"These guys have the tacos and nachos thing figured out. Great decor and hot, hot waitresses.   We had lunch and it was pretty quiet. Good service. I'm sure things get crazy at night, though!"}
{"text":"El Hefe is the place to go for great Mexican food.  Hands down.  What is even better than the food here is the customer service.  It is a rare thing to say for a restaurant.  Here though,  it is said with the understanding that both food and service show a level of  care that a 5 star restaurant should display.   ALEXIS is a woman who puts the cares and service of the patron front and center, from managing the establishment to rolling up her sleeves and stepping behind the bar, host station or at a table.    You want a great experience, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Great tacos esp the mahi ones. Cold beer and a fun atmosphere. We will be back. The staff is all really hot. Def different during the day than at night"}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible, horrible! Waitress was beyond extremely rude. We felt like we were a burden to her and other staff members. I would never ever go back or recommend this establishment to anyone. Customer service is a minus zero."}
{"text":"The food was good, lots of beer selections and TV's were plentiful. The reason I am giving it only 3 stars was the customer service. They just didn't seem to be to interested in serving me at the bar."}
{"text":"The service was absolutely horrible. We walked in sat down and had three servers pass by without acknowledging us. I had to get up to find a server and ask for menus. She dropped them off and again we played the waiting game. Nothing. No server approached us. There were about 5 servers doing nothing at the bar while we sat and waited. The food is great here it just sucks how shitty these servers are. It's like they don't understand that good service could possibly mean a good tip. Maybe you guys need to staff up and assign a table per server in order to satisfy customer needs. Sorry not sorry."}
{"text":"I went for taco Tuesday with one of my friends and had an overall pretty good experience!   Server: very sweet girl, very approachable, great service.   Atmosphere: pretty fun, nice/casual, great place to come grab dinner after work, 20s to 30s crowd really.   Surrounding area: as someone new to AZ, I thought downtown Tempe was really awesome! Lots to do/see.   Food: $2 tacos...can't beat that! The mahi mahi and carne asada tacos were my favorite. Knocked it down a couple stars because the other tacos I tried weren't as good as I'd expected so I definitely wouldn't want to pay full price for those. I'm from San Diego though so my expectations of tacos are pretty high!   Drinks: my friend ordered their signature margarita and she said it was pretty good but tasted a bit watered down. I stuck with water though.   Would most likely return. Maybe I'll try out the Scottsdale location next."}
{"text":"This is the best taco Tuesday spot in AZ! Fun atmosphere and great tacos. Came in a few weeks ago and the manager Marley was so awesome she took care of our group beyond expectation, we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Went to El Hefe to watch the Stanley Cup game last night.  Overall had a good time.  The place is big, loud and as other reviewed mentioned if you are looking for booty and some booze, then El Hefe is your place.  When we first sat down we had unlimited attention from 3 different wait staff.  After they settled in to who had our table, things slowed.  Service and drink delivery times were slow!  We never even got our last drink order.   Food was  good.  Chips, salsa  guacamole, various tacos and fajitas were enjoyed by our group.  All had excellent flavor and good portion size.  The only real problem was with the slow service and the bill.  At the end of the night when the bill arrived, I double checked and 3 items were added to our bill that we did not have.  I think I surprised our waitress by even looking.  She immediately removed them from the bill without question and had a lame excuse, \"This must have been leftover from an unclosed lunch ticket\".  Really, in today's modern service system, 2 items on a lunch ticket would not be closed out at 8 pm?    Overall a fun place to go to people watch, hit on women, watch a game and east some good food.  Just be aware of your bill and don't be in a hurry for service."}
{"text":"This place is so fun! Always good for a turn up no matter what day of the week. Definitely geared more towards the party crowd. The bartenders are friendly and the music is good. You don't want to start here if you're looking for a tame night out."}
{"text":"Had a blast partying here on a WEDNESDAY night. Place turns up real high!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. Bouncers there are a straight up joke. Waited in like for a solid 20 min only to get close to the front and have this arrogant prick of a bouncer walk up and tell me I couldn't get in cuz I had high top shoes that barely I mean barely covered my ankles. I was a lil peaved so I start looking around I see a handful of other ppl with even higher tops and this kid says \"we got it don't worry about it\" I sit there outside the line while I watch this kid and another tall bouncer look over at me n laugh as they don't go up to these ppl. I go back to them like what the hell, and they said get out out of here and don't worry about it. Fn joke of a crew this owner has running his or hers bar. Sounds like I got singled out and discriminated against. Love stuck up bars that think they're the shit and can do whatever the Fck they want to do. That's why Gringo Star was legit and will get my business over you hands down."}
{"text":"This place is pathetic!  I love Old Town and had heard some interesting things about this place.  I decided to try it for a quick drink on Cinco de Mayo before dinner.  It is in a great location, but that is the only positive.   The service is some of the worst that I have ever seen in Scottsdale.  The bartenders, management, and bouncers were all rude, slow, and extremely pretentious.    The place is very dirty (wet floors, dirty table tops).  I felt like I was at a fraternity house.  Also, the bartender changed the tip amount on my card.  Such a shady practice and I will certainly be disputing it.  You could not pay me to come back here."}
{"text":"I had a half full drink and I put it down on the bar for about 30 seconds and when I went to take a sip, it had been thrown away. The bar back had tossed it and I when I asked about it he lied and said he didn't take it. I asked for a new one and the bartender said no. Horrible customer service and I will not be spending any more money there."}
{"text":"I was visiting family. I was underdressed for this place. I am a US MARINE!!! Semper Fi!!! The door men had converse on. No even a suit on! I was in my team Glock shirt, Levi's jean's and cowboy boots!!! I don't recommend this place at all!!! I hope that I can receive the support!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great little quiet spot to grab a hot tea and read some D.H. Lawrence on their Sunday Brunch. All proceeds go to feministbookstores.org"}
{"text":"Visited AZ for the first time from CA earlier this month, my cousin recommended El Hefe for taco Tuesday so we went. When we first approached the security outside, I was confused because he asked for my I.d. I asked him why do I have to show I.d to get into a restaurant? He told me it was the rule and this place was a bar so I brushed it off. The guy was a buff white guy with a long beard and I assumed he was going to give us trouble. However, I told him we were visiting and he was just sweet as pie. He was so cool and down to earth and I felt bad that I passed judgment before conversing with him. They had a DJ with a dope sound and lighting system and it was the perfect atmosphere for a Tuesday. I ordered chicken tacos and I thought they were gross, I didn't like the food too much but after a few margaritas I was all in. We then realized that this place was turning into a club after the kitchen was closed. We weren't dressed for the occasion but we stayed. We began to sit on top of the booths after eating like everyone else who came in to party. After sitting up there for about 45 minutes another even bigger guard with a long beard and buff frame approached us and told us that the booth we were sitting on was reserved. He pleasantly asked us to get down and I could tell he didn't want to really tell us. I assumed the worst of this place when we approached because of the tales I've heard but this place goes up on a Tuesday and we had a ball. The bar tender knew it was my girl's bday so she hooked us up with shots and I tipped her all night. I'm sad to read other reviews about racist bad service because that wasn't our experience. I would go back in a heartbeat! Thank you to staff at El Heffe for treating us like we were guest, y'all made our experience so much more. To the two guards that night, thanks for being so freakin cool and down to earth! Not really down with the swirl but they were cute too lol! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to a night of good music and dancing since my friends said it was awesome here last week. We got here and were sorely disappointed with terrible dub step mixes of songs completely unfit for dancing. They said it was a different guy spinning than last week. Terrible experience--bring back last week's DJ because tonight's sucked. He even played a knock off of \"How We Do\", which should have been by 50 Cent and The Game but was instead by someone who sounded like he works for Kidz Bop. Ruined the entire experience for me."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for 53 minutes for 3 tacos and I am still waiting, my waitress has been avoiding me and has literally gave me only my first drink... In 53 minutes one drink. I asked her how much longer my food was going to be and she simply responded, \" I'm not sure we just got really busy at once\" and walked away. When I got here there was literally about 6-8 tables waiting to eat and now this placed is packed and the people sitting next to me at the bar are just talking about how anti social the staff is. I used to be a server and I kind of get it, but 1 hour waiting for 3 tacos and one drink? This is the worst service I've had in a longgg time."}
{"text":"I was at El Hefe during March madness. Place was great. The bar is huge and the staff is great. The manager - I think his name is Mike- was very accommodating finding us a seat and getting us served quickly despite being as busy as they were. I would definitely recommend this place. Especially for happy hour"}
{"text":"The bar itself isn't bad, but given the worthless \"security\" staff it earns 1 star at best.    I went here on NYE with a small group of people which was fun until a drunk started spraying the crowd with champagne. A security officer was standing right there watching him so I asked him if he was going to do anything. Keep in mind at this point my shirt is visibly wet with alcohol from this. The security guy asks me who it was and I point him out. He then stands there and does nothing. After a few minutes, I asked him \"are you going to handle this or no?\"  He just put his hands up and said \"what am I going to do?\"  Seriously??  I understand the bar makes money off of the private tables so you don't want to throw them out. But he could've at least spoke to them or faked it and at least pretended to do his job. Lucky for him we are an even tempered group as had we approached the other group and handled this ourselves the \"security\" staff would be lucky to have the skills to call 911 let alone do their job.    I'll never return to a bar that can't even hand the drunks they create."}
{"text":"First place to visit upon arriving in old town and I must say I loved it! The waitress was nice, the food was good, happy hour delivered. Went back a week later for dinner and drinks, and it was really fun! especially when the confetti and dance music started..I definitely want to visit for taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"This place is the absolute pits, I've been there twice (shame on me for going back) and can't decide which experience sucked more. The staff could not have been more rude, the waitress could not have showed up less times and tables suck as they were too small.   The first time I went we asked for champagne which came warm and unopened and with no glasses for 5 girls. The manager walked over and asked how everything was and I said well we would like that opened and some glasses to which he apologized and told the waitress it should be opened for guest to which she acted like a child and didn't speak to us the rest of the time there.   The next time we went we had a group of 9, we were sitting at two tables. I asked our waitress at the beginning of the dinner if she would do two checks to which she said she couldn't even though the other table hadn't ordered. She too never checked on us once. Come to find out parties over 8 get gratuity automatically added so we had to tip her which she didn't deserve. I will never come back to this establishment."}
{"text":"The place is not too bad within the general douchebaggy community. The problem of this place is the staff!!! The girls in the bar are there spotting the potential big tippers, I don't blame them but please.... I spent a good while with my card in my hand waiting for my order to be taken while the girls were attending all the boys around me... Fed up, I turned to my husband and told him to try to order himself. He took my place in the bar and within maybe 2 min he was back with drinks for everybody!!!! Shameful!!! But the worst part was at the end... we ordered our drinks and without previous notice from the bar, once we got served and payed of course, this bouncer arrived with the worst manners ever, shouting to us to get out of there. We were really shocked since we were just two couples, quite calm compared with the rest of the audience, not really trouble makers... We told him that if they were not going to let us finish the drinks they shouldn't have sold them to us, right?  Well the bouncer started shouting even more at us and being incredibly rude, we left the place before things would go worse... Horrible experience, never again!"}
{"text":"Wow.....so first off I never wright negative reviews. With that being said I felt compelled to write this review... my husband and I are from Cincinnati, Ohio, we moved to Arizona one week ago. We went to El Hefe to watch the Bengals football game because it was Bengals bar. Unfortunately when trying to use the restroom I found there to be no toilet paper, fortunately I saw several rolls on the countertop (in the corner), underneath one of the waitresses bags so I conveniently grabbed one and gave one to the person going into my stall after me since it was too late for me. Unfortunate to my surprise I was immediately accused of stealing a purse (even tho the purse never moved) or maybe using the men's bathroom (not sure wtf that came from) or smuggling drugs by a waitress in the restroom and got kicked out. I told my story to the manager and to some other head personal and nothing happened. Trust me I'm just as confused as you are given we just spent over $300 at this place. As far as I'm concerned I literally did their job by providing toilet paper to their guests and I was removed from their bar. Needless to say we won't be back and are so disappointed bc we are huge Bengals fans. I'm still in shock."}
{"text":"Awesome food, fast and friendly service. Mark (one of the managers) was super accommodating and stayed to chat with us about the area. Would definitely come back next time I visit."}
{"text":"My husband & I have been here a few time during Spring Training. Each time we have ordered the fried avocado tacos & shrimp tacos. Really good I must say. Staff has always been pleasant and attentive. My husband enjoys watching all the March Madness basketball games on their many Tv's."}
{"text":"Such an interesting bar...so glad we stopped by before the crowd arrived.  We enjoyed a beer while the bartender told us what would be in store that night and over the weekend.  If you are young and single, probably a good place to hang out and get drunk."}
{"text":"This place is ummmmmm...Are you kidding me? Missy of it's her or not or some other girl completely ignored a group of women for 10 minutes. And guess what, she was on her phone texting. Like come on.   I yelled hello 5 times because the music was loud, then she has the audacity to ask me if I'm ok. And I'm like yes I'm ok and she gave me this look of absolute death. I was completely sober and I'm sorry but you sit behind a busy bar ignoring your patrons texting people. And then you sure as hell don't respond with dirty looks to paying customers.  I'm not impressed with this place and there are plenty of other bars to go to where you at least get a friendly response. I'm just annoyed and the drink I ended up getting was awful. I won't be going back, the music and the scene wasn't fun.   In addition to that, they had some space theme with items from party city with blow up spaceships and cheap streamers. The people looking at this review won't even care. But I had to write it since I have a few minutes to waste on this review."}
{"text":"El Hefe Scottsdale is definitely as worthy of the way you spend your daytime hours as it is your after hours. I went during lunch and found the restaurant to be quite enjoyable. The club/bar layout is open and spacious, giving you an alternative option to the cramped styles of the traditional lunch spots. The tacos are phenomenal, I highly recommend the al pastor or duck carnitas, for great savory options. And the positive, aesthetically pleasing staff kept the experience light and full of good vibes. An all around good experience."}
{"text":"This place was the worst bar/club I have EVER been to. Worst experience ever. I went on a Friday night and it is way too packed. No room to dance, let alone walk! Everyone was pushing and shoving & it took me 3 tries to get into the bathroom. The line was ridiculously long & on top of that you would have to wait once you got inside too. Some of the people there are just plain rude and tried cutting in front of people multiple times. That was my first time and definitely is my last."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday night. It was packed and not looking like a good time was to be had. The only reason I even went was for a Birthday party. I am a biker with no club affiliation and had on carpenter jeans , boots and a motorcycle t shirt. I was told by the little bitch bouncer/fluffer at the door my pants where too baggy??? Really??? I'm actually happy I didn't get in to an over priced dive bar in a high rent zip code. Do yourselves a favor and stay away. Unless you want to hang out with a bunch of suckers that think Scottsdale is so cool."}
{"text":"A trip back to Tempe, and I was looking for a place I remembered from before, Canteen.  It's now become El Hefe's.  They've done some renovating, and more patio space out front.  The staff is friendly, although, a little like Hooter's girls.  Service was very very slow, food was great, $2 tacos very good.  I would look around a little in the area before stopping here, but...give it a try and decide for yourself."}
{"text":"El hefe is the place to be on any weekend. The tacos here are to die for and the atmosphere is unbeatable. The DJ is always playing the best music and keeping everyone entertained. The bartenders and servers are always making sure your drink stays full which is a plus. I'd recommend this place to all of my friends."}
{"text":"Eek! This place was not the business. We were in town to watch the Chargers play...some people the day before were denied entry because they had Charger gear on. LAME! Well over 1,000 made the trek to AZ to come and spend money, yet they wanted no part in that. The weird thing is that supposedly they arranged with us to have a 10% off tab (along with Whiskey Row) but that never came to fruition. I can say, however, our waitress was awesome! Some of the best customer service! The music was lame and the food was even worse. The chips and salsa was the highlight of the meal. They need a complete revamp of their menu and need to put someone in the back who can actually cook."}
{"text":"Very unhappy with the remodel. You cannot smoke on the property so if you want a cigarette you have to leave the bar and re-enter which is inconvenient if you are not finished with your drink or it is a busy weekend night."}
{"text":"Good, friendly service.   Nice patio.   Not too happy about the difference in clothing between female and male staff clothing."}
{"text":"This place is a bit on the pricey side, but during their happy hour it's at least a little more affordable. Their fried avocado tacos are freaking delicious!! Their chips and salsa and nachos are pretty good too. I also enjoy their margaritas and redbull vodka slushies. But definitely go during happy hour if you want some better deals"}
{"text":"Great grilled mahi tacos and a unique fried avocado taco, with a nice patio. On taco tuesday both tacos can be had for just $2 each. IT will take 3-4 to make a meal so the chips and salsa for $3 may be a nice add on.  The one odd thing here are the servers, it seemed to be a homogeneous mix of young, fit women in tight clothing. I rather not pay a premium for this, nor do I feel confident scarfing down on cheap tacos in such an environment.  The grilled fish taco has great flavor on the fish alone. A batered and fried avacado slice does not need any more explinaion."}
{"text":"The service is sub par on more than one occasion. Food is good, not spectacular, but I can eat their guac and street tacos no problem and feel satisfied. It's definitely more of a night club restaurant/bar.   Today was sort of the last straw for me. If I sit at the bar, and it's not slammed, I don't think it's too much to ask for the bartender to promptly acknowledge me. If your busy, fine just day \"be right with you\"! Nothing. I felt invisible. Asked another server to speak to the manager and he came out from the back and still bartender didn't acknowledge me.   Thanks manager for trying to fix your inattentive bartender's blunder, I appreciate it, but it just wasn't meant to be. I just don't have time for mediocrity! Hopefully, this place improved with the right management, as I've seen recent reviews slamming the service."}
{"text":"My group spend well over $3000 (not including tips) on drinks, tables with the taps on, and three bottles with bottle service on my birthday...and tipped everyone like crazy...and what did this place do to thank us? They kicked us all out and called the cops, getting 2 people in my group arrested when they did NOTHING wrong...the bouncers are a serious issue at this place.  I would have been a very valuable customer to have, but now I will never go back there and will NEVER suggest this place to my friends, I would actually go out of my way to tell them not to."}
{"text":"This was my first time at El Hefe, and it will be my last. My friends just wanted to try different establishments in Mill St so this was one of our stops. The negative experience started with the hostess; the sign said \"seat yourself\" but when one of my friends asked if there was a table for 4, the hostess changed the sign to \"wait to be seated\" and just left us there. When she came back I asked if there were seats outside since it was a gorgeous afternoon. She seemed annoyed at my question and left us waiting again. While we waited my friend asked for some shots at the bar, but when the hostess approached saying there was a table, very rudely asked if we had closed the tab or we would have to keep waiting for our table. So we paid and followed her. Her lack of customer service skills was appalling. Our waitress came by and took our orders, not the best customer service either; when my partner asked for 2 beers she immediately said she couldn't serve him 2 beers so we had to clarify one was for me; Why would she assume that, if I was right beside him discussing what to order? He then asked for some jalapeños on the side for his tacos, but the jalapeños never came. For the finishing touch of our experience, they had the audacity to automatically add the gratuity...like I said, there was only 4 of us, I have NEVER been in a restaurant where the gratuity is automatically added unless it's a large party. Maybe this place adds the tip like that because they know patrons wouldn't give a penny for their lack of customer service?"}
{"text":"We stopped by just because it looked pretty cool. Dude, so the wife and I are enjoying ourselves having some shots and beers right? I didn't want to stick around too long so we decided to pay our tab. The server comes back saying my card is declined! Um excuse me could you run it again please? She runs it again and it is still declined! I check my app and yup, there's money because I used the card an hour before. She said there's an atm by the door so I go to use it and the bar charges gd $3.50 per transaction! Not stepping foot in there again just for that reason."}
{"text":"Back in the days this place used to be my spot for taco Tuesday but something changed  First the menu , they took of 3 if there best tacos  Second they raise there price from 2 to $3  Nicole was our server and she was great to us  The place was EMPTY at around 5-6 pm  And we learned it's bc the prices change after 7 pm ( stupid )  Bottom line I won't go there again for taco Tuesday just not the same anymore"}
{"text":"Was bar hopping around Scottsdale and were very impressed with all the bars.  I visited years ago with a friend and remembered El Hefe to be one of the top bars in the area. We walked over for a drink and immediately upon walking in the whole bar smelled like dirty mop water. Not very appealing but we decided to stay for a shot. The glasses were all dirty and smelled like the bar itself. Safe to say we quickly made our way out of there and back across the street."}
{"text":"Dirty!  Lipstick on the rim of my glass and dried old food stuck on my plate.  Restroom was dirty.  After hours this place can be violent!  Fights and frat guys with attitudes.  There are so many classy places is Scottsdale, I would avoid this dive!  Disgusting!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends to do some day drinking on Nat'l Margarita day. This was our second stop of many planned on our adventure. I ordered the bulldog margarita expecting something amazing........and was disappointed. The only thing I tasted was beer and margarita mix. There was either a very small amount or no tequila in this drink. This is a very popular drink; I could see it on almost every table that afternoon. I am not sure if I will be back, not a fan of watered down or virgin adult beverages."}
{"text":"Rude staff! I would have this place shut down if I could have my way! I was there last night with my partner of 3 years. We are both beautiful women and I do not believe my vanity should cripple me! So when a bar tender proceeded to video tape my partner and I exchanging a loving kiss like any other couple would.I asked him to stop taping us and ofcourse I was angry!!!! How dare anyone have the audacity to do that in my face. The following event is even more disturbing. My partner and I were then forcefully removed from the venue by 6 bouncers. 6! Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Just ate $2 tacos during Happy Hour! They were soooo good! The service was impeccable! Ask for Brittany- she was a ball of energy!!! The atmosphere was upbeat with current music. The place smelled good as we walked in. This is a great atmosphere to eat and chill out, especially during Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"missy is the best. hooked us up, and now i've got a wife and a kid on the way. el hefe was lit"}
{"text":"Food's ok. Beer came in a hot glass, ptew. Wait staff was super friendly and efficient. Lots of flies if you are lonely. I killed a hand full but they kept coming back!  I will keep walking next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The free guac, salsa and chip was good. The queso not so much.  This is definitely a spot for guys to see half naked chicks cause the drinks tasted like koolaid. I left more than half on the dirty counter."}
{"text":"This place sucks. No line cuz they let everyone in. Can't move. The floor is nasty. People tackled by security taken away by cops. I showed ID and was told to throw away my water. No problem. Threw it away and walked in, other guard grabs me strongly by the arm and pulls me to the other side of the rope telling me he didn't let me in. He was standing right next to the guy who did. So confused I go around a pole and the other guys acts like I'm stupid flashing me in like \"hurry up\". Wtf? I go in the floor is nasty. My shoes SUCK to the floor. The place is overcrowded. People acting stupid. Girl RUNS out to vomit. An employee not taking our order grabs the card, he's not helping is at all or even knows what we want and my friend says hey, what's up? And the guy helping us finally says HE WORKS HERE. Ok... but why is he taking our card? It's just shady and nasty and they herd you like cattle. It's ridiculous. We had one round and went across the street. Way better. Better music, better drinks. I can still fee his grip on my arm. It's excessive. I'm not one of the other drunkasses barfing outside. DO NOT RECOMMEND. Literally anywhere else would be better. They should really just  erbally tell people what to do instead of grabbing them. What the hell. NEVER happened before and I go to way better clubs in the San Diego gaslamp. Like do not touch me. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"In general old town has guaranteed customers... so therefore service I don't  expect 5 star rated waitress or  bartenders.   A new waitress was there TONiGHT March 17th 2018... 1) she was not able to make my drink correctly  2) she bought 2 drinks of the second one when I ordered 1.  Being civil i  informed her what she didn't do right without drinking the drinks at all ... she spoke back ......sorry that's what I herd so I it must be Paid She did not attempt to correct my drinks at all ...and two minutes after she asked if I was the complainer type?   I was contacted by riot/el Helfe team.   I am so appreciative of the interaction. They addressed the issue. I am looking forward to returning to el Helfe with all my friends and family.  I am grateful of the relied CustomerService service and am sure this pass experience will be rare."}
{"text":"I love these tacos, ordered the El Pastor tacos. Wow lots of flavor just enough spice. Big patio in the back, next time margaritas!"}
{"text":"Don't go to the men in this club, bar grill whatever you want to call it. Obviously bad service is everywhere because guys don't care and the girls do. People  keep throwing their drink at bar tenders. Guess that's the service. Ask for Marley she will hook you up. Probably. Not like. He looked at me and I was telling him to come Over and didn't want to serve me. Don't ask mike for help. Or bar back they will ignore you."}
{"text":"I came by here on a Saturday night during my visit in Scottsdale. I got in without any issues and was impressed that there was no cover charge.   The music was mainly top 40s which was what I would mainly listen to. I didn't think it was as busy and it was nice to be able to move around and enjoy the place.   The bar was packed with people all around and it took a while for me to get a drink. I ordered a Tito's with soda and it was around $12 per drink. I thought it was pretty high but it was probably normal for the area I was in.   Overall, I had a good time and may come back for the music. I would personally like to go to a place with cheaper drink prices."}
{"text":"I come here all the time since I live next door, its always the same. The bartenders and servers all have ego/attitude problems. They have these douchebag promoters that are always there doing seemingly nothing. Seriously there is not one employee that is happy or friendly, they all think they are a god.   When I come here I know what I am getting myself into but there is one incident that has pushed me over the edge. On a completely packed Saturday night I ordered drinks after fighting the crowd to the bar. All was well until the bartender accidentally dropped my credit card in the trashcan under the bar. Okay no big deal, he can reach in and grab it right? Nope, he refused to give it back to me and said I would have to come back tomorrow and get it. I still cannot believe he said that. I was trying to be nice about the situation but he was a complete dick. I brought only my card and ID out, so how am I supposed to buy anything else that night, as well as this was the end of finals and I had a flight home the next day! So finally he got one of the barbacks to take the trashcan outside of the definitely above fire code capacity bar, get my card, and bring it back. This took just over 30 min just standing there. When I got the card back he said he would buy me a drink, awesome, so I'm waiting for the drink and he keeps taking other peoples orders and skips me. After 10 min I was like are you ignoring me or something? He didn't say anything but finally gave me my drink and I left.  I hate this place with a passion. Whats strange is the Scottsdale location is much friendlier, and you would think it to be opposite. They need to change their management and give their staff an attitude adjustment. No one wants a bartender/server who has a stick up their ass."}
{"text":"Not even worth 1 star.. Blend food, customer service sucks in that place. Servers with bad attitude. Very unhappy experience. Definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"Unsure the bartenders name but she was a great time the atmosphere is enough to want me to come back. Yea Shirley temples"}
{"text":"This place is always first on the list! Can't go wrong with the boss and Sean the bartender always knows how to make the best drinks"}
{"text":"After completing the tour El Hefe's in AZ and Chicago, this is consistently one of the best places to watch a game. Whether it's NHL Playoffs or NFL season it's always a fun and energetic setting. The place is extremely popular hence it's packed on the weekends yet people act overly surprised by this. I understand people not being psyched on paying more for 'street tacos' but if you step up off the value menu to a Torta then I think your experience will be that much better. Also, the Happy Hour is fabulous as well and highly recommended whenever you can make it!"}
{"text":"Protip: Add the Fried Egg to the Torta.  After visiting El Hefe in both the Scottsdale and Chicago locations I must say that this is one of my favorite places to get a modern spin on delicious Mexican food and watch a game, party or attend Happy Hour. The vibe and energy of the bar can't be denied.  If you're looking for a nice quiet night out then this is surely not going to be the venue for you. But if you want to have fun, get a great Beer-Garita (all time amazing) and some high quality Mexican food this is the place. I didn't even know Duck Carnitas were possible until coming here and they did not disappoint one bit. It's hard to pick a favorite taco because they are all enjoyable.   Whenever I can visit Scottsdale or Chicago, El Hefe is a must stop to watch a Bears or Blackhawks game. I'd argue it's almost as fun as actually attending the games themselves!"}
{"text":"The Mamacita margarita is SO GOOD! Ask for extra strawberries and you're golden. Check in offer for free guac is always appreciated! They are surprisingly not too crowded for Happy Hour, so it's a great place to stop by after work even with a big group. The only con is that one time my friend and I got the same margarita and they looked totally different colors (pink vs. beige/peach) - they both tasted delicious so it's not a big deal, but the consistency could be better. Like I said, just as for extra strawberries!"}
{"text":"Place is your standard bar/Serving food place. Unfortunately, I can't comment on the food and the one star comes from waiting over 20 mins (on a lite traffic day) for a server, who could care less and never made it to the table even after being asked."}
{"text":"I thought this place was spot on! They run a tight ship (runners for everything) great HH, house Margs and chips & salsa! The only reason they didn't get 5 was the shrimp on the shrimp tacos was blah! Fried avocado taco yea!!!!"}
{"text":"Whatever you are looking for you will find it at El Hefe. Too far from Tempe? That's okay! There is a second location in Old Town Scottadale. Delicious food, whether your taste is burgers or tacos it's all prepared to perfection. Every member of the staff is ridiculously good looking but they are equally as friendly. Come early to eat or later to dance off all of those delicious calories you ate there. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"One of the best two in one spots I have ever step foot in! Their tacos are full of flavor, my favorite is the chicken tinga- perfect blend of sweet and salty. Then there is their late night partying, holy awesomeness! Full of energy and good vibes along with some confetti ;) who doesn't love confetti?!"}
{"text":"Great drinks...good food!  Fajitas were good and wife had tacos!  Great scenery in an awesome part of town"}
{"text":"Holy cow this bar is out of control. People come here to party like it's their last day on earth! I like to bring people here from out of town. They're always amused with the beergaritas and shocked that people like to party like it's 1999 on Sundays. I love El Hefe because they have a great happy hour but I can only handle this bar in small doses. I'm not a fan of not being able to walk without my drink spilling and getting bumped by random bitches with big purses."}
{"text":"This place sucks.  The bouncers are so rude. Please spend your time and money going somewhere else."}
{"text":"The people here sure know how to make you feel special. We had a friends surprise birthday party here, there was about 20 of us who came and went throughout the night. We had bottle service and went through much more alcohol that we anticipated buy hey, Sunday funday will do that to you.  The boss is the bomb."}
{"text":"You all knew it was coming down the bend eventually... El Jefe must review El Hefe.   ~Fud/Drink~ I have not eaten here yet. It to me, looks like pizzaz filled gringo-ized Mexican that you'd come to expect at a douchey bar started up by bro's from Scottsdale. Just skimming through the menu it just exemplifies how many horrible Mexican food options we actually have here in Arizona. Its like all the American-Style Chinese places around each corner, same-ol-same-ol.   With that said, the drinks were tasty. I had two separate margaritas here, the best being the House Margarita. I enjoyed the flavors which were balanced between sweetness, crispness, and booziness. I do not enjoy paying $12 however, for a margarita...If I want to spike up my hair, get my surfer voice on, pop my collar and head down to a bangin' club in Scottsdale, now we're talking. But here, on Mill? Nope, I'd rather go to a couple other places for that type of coin. But then again, flavors mixed well...  ~Atmosphere/Service~ The atmosphere is what earns this place the bulk of its stars. It transitions better than the bulk of restaurants I have seen: From a day-bar, to a lunch spot, into a pre-club spot, and finally into a full-out nightclub. Good for them, the chameleon thing works really well. I happened to enjoy the latter two versions quite well with a few of my friends, with music blaring loud as can be into the heat of the night just a few weeks back. The DJ was no slouch, dropping some good mixes and allowing the booze to influence my white boy dance moves well.    Service is quite poor here, however. All of the girls are just there for eye-candy. They dance on top of the bar and seating areas once it transitions into a nightclub, and seem to not fully care that this is their job during the other portions of the night. One of the girls tending for me literally was on her phone, looked up at me and smiled as I looked onward asking for another, and then back down at her phone. About 15 seconds later she said she was sorry and got caught up with a friend, and then made me my drink. That's so lame, and exactly the type of service you expect from this place. No suggestions should be asked for, just don't do it...I doubt they really know their own menu quite well.  ~The Downlow/Extras~ No extras...reall simply put: Did you see how there are pros and cons to everything here? It's give and take, and I should not need to expect that from a place where I am spending a good amount of money. Plus, they spelled Jefe wrong....I mean, you are in Arizona, spell it right. This place tries to be The Boss, but they are barely that. They get 2 stars for the nightlife atmosphere and a  1/2 star which is rounded up for solid drinks. They lose a star for shit service and an over-priced douche menu. Would I go back? Yes...but that's after I have had a bunch elsewhere and then walk on in here to enjoy maybe one drink and the DJ music. Otherwise I will leave this for stupid ASU frat boys who can't get their oversized skateboard out to the Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"Good crowd but way too loud. If they had real dancing the loud music would be fine but it's more of a bar so being able to talk would be nice."}
{"text":"The thing I like about old town is that all the bars bring their own little flare and el hefe's is one of my favorites. A dash of cantina and club life is always a great mixture for good times."}
{"text":"Made it to the soft opening lastnight had a good time. Look forward to going back. Didn't eat so can't rate that, but so far so good on the service."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and fresh. Price is what I would expect for being where it is. The service however was horrendous. My husband and I came in the afternoon on a Tuesday and there wasn't many people in the restaurant. We were told to find out own seating and all of the available tables were filthy with plates still on them from their previous customers. And the three servers that were in sight were just taking care of select tables. So we found the table we wanted and stood there in hopes that someone would see us and come clean it. That is not what happened. We had to clean it ourselves by moving everything to another empty table.   Now that we have sat down we waited for our server for 10 minutes. They clearly saw us but neglected to come to our table.   After managing to finally get our order in it took 40-45 minutes. Mind you it was only two of us and one of us just had a salad.   Overall the experience was horrible."}
{"text":"El Hefe...hmmmm! Taco Bell has better service and food! It's overpriced and the service is awful. The so called manager, Tina, did nothing and was unapologetic. We later find out she's not even a manager. The food was bland and salty. They messed up our simple order...and 20 min later the order is still not out. We left. We should of went to Salty Señoritas for Mexican."}
{"text":"So I waited for an outside for 30 minutes, the ladies at the door were kind enough to tell me that I had opted out of seat placement. however, they got me seated within 5 minutes. Margarita with the little bottle bomb AF, tacos were great until I tasted pineapple.... My fault for not reading the description. Scenery was fantastic! ASU's finest.... Server was great. Not bad for a place around the \"other\" school....."}
{"text":"I went here for Lunch on Football Sunday 2 weeks ago. It was great! The environment was great! Plenty of TVs showing all major games and I liked they have a DJ playing music while eating.   The selection of the food was very good, great price value and the quality and taste was great!   The service was great! The waitress was friendly and did a great job in explaining my food options! I'll definitely will return next time I'm back in town."}
{"text":"First off I would like to say that I usually have a great time at El Hefe on Mill. Tonight was very different... We didn't even make it in the door because someone in our party was wearing Nike basketball shoes. This is Mill Ave, first, there is no dress code. Second, he was very nicely dressed. Third, in a party of ten people, he was the only non-Caucasian. We feel this was extremely racist, as other people wearing \"sneakers\" were being admitted. We won't be returning to El Hefe on Mill anytime soon. This treatment is ridiculous, unfair, and unnecessary."}
{"text":"Love this place! This is a go-to spot for my friends and I. Every time we are looking for a good happy hour, a fun night out, or just some good Mexican food - this is the perfect place!!! They also  play the best music and have the best environment for dancing. The servers & bartenders are all nice and make sure you have a good time. Definitely check it out, I would recommend the bullgaritas & the tacos."}
{"text":"if the bartenders would pay attention to their guest as much as they pay attention to their cell phones or their starbucks the service would be amazing..."}
{"text":"This was the place to be on Cinco de Mayo! Margaritas, friendly faces, and music that gets you to \"pump it up\" in your seat, of course.  Now I know where to go next year!"}
{"text":"BOM BOM BOM BOM BOM BOMP BOMP BOMP BOMP BOMP BOMP BOMP BOM BOM BOM BOM BOM BOM BOM BOMP  everybody f***ing jump!  BOM BOM BOM BOMBOMP BOM BOM BOM BOM BOM BOMBOMP   Other than the imposing \"you need to start partying now\" mentality that is endemic to the scene that is El Hefe, The vibe here is pretty cool when not bro-crowded (or \"browded\" if I may make up a term).   Food is decent but the kitchen can back up quick-- if every table is taken during the day, it might take upwards to an hour before your food will arrive.  And I'm pretty sure the bar forces its employees to dance on the bar countertops and booths... *cow prodding the girls* \"You stay up there an dance and feed those men that cheap tequila!\""}
{"text":"Go for happy hour! The tacos are amazing and the margaritas are good. The blonde bartender is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"We always have so much fun here!  Fun atmosphere, the dancers pouring the shots is always fun. Reliable, fun night out."}
{"text":"Be sure to ask to pricing for shots/drinks. Ordered the same shots twice and was charged very differently with one being excessively high."}
{"text":"Wild every night! My favorite place hands-down in AZ! The night life here is contagious and Iv never been disappointed with there Sunday fun day! Every Sunday they have a corn hole competition and crazy drink specials like penny refills!! You also have to try there duck and pork tacos or there Hefe Hamburger! My favorite margarita on the menu is the la chica flaca. If you want a fun place to get lunch and a few drinks or looking to go crazy night this is the spot."}
{"text":"This place is amazing I go there all the time for the tacos and they're amazed la chica flaca margarita! The staff is always attentive and willing to help out with anything even if your phone needs a charge. They are always holding fun events like taco eating contest and what not. If you're in the Scottsdale area you should definitely stop by for lunch or go later at night for a crazy party!"}
{"text":"Recently checked this place out. Got there early, thank goodness because after 630, the place turns into a seriously overcrowded, hot room, of typical \"Scottsdale\" barbie dolls. That aside, I must say this:  GREAT SERVICE! GREAT FOOD! GREAT MARAGARITAS! and an awesome staff who were very attentive and personable!   We tried a lot of things on their menu, but I must say the maragarita with the jalapenos was my favorite margarita. It was so fresh and tangy.   The taqueria style street tacos were killer!!! two words Beef Cheek! I definitely recommend them. The Duck were awesome too.   The Carne Asada torta was killer good as well. just really big! My hubby and I split everything and were there from about 5pm until 8 or so and it was a good time.   Fun people watching as well. Next time we go, and we will return, we want to rent a table with the tap attached and bring a ton of friends.   Worth the time to travel there, find it, and enjoy the atmosphere. its definitely a  fun vibe!"}
{"text":"Horrible!!! We've been here before a few times and loved the food! Came back for an El Hefe dog and a Bloody Mary but couldn't even get in cause of their \"new\" dress codes prohibiting basketball shoes. Its not  even club hours yet and we just wanted to eat. retro Jordan's are $200 dollar vs some $30 vans that are ok. Our group will just have our nights out somewhere else, denying customers over shoes...really?"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would!!! I came here for lunch one day with a friend. I had never visited Tempe and she was showing me around town. She was raving about how great this restaurant was. WRONG!!!!! 1) I ordered the Carne Asada fries. They were ehhh. The steak was still very pink/bloody 2) at the END of my meal a ROACH came crawling out off my PLATE!!! The waiter had the nerve to ask if I wanted another plate fixed before I left. Nope! I'm good! Had our meal comped. Will never eat there again!!!"}
{"text":"Britany is an angel, excellent service. Great patio, great vibes.  chips and salsa are always good"}
{"text":"College town spot with hard bodies, hot women and the Mill Avenue let's get FN hammered feel and soak it up with grease from a kick ass burger. Hit this spot when you are ready to throw down and grab an Uber back. Tons of venues in walking distance. This is party town! #vino2ultimate #vinosquared"}
{"text":"This was not a great experience. This planning for Scottsdale Rose Day was less than well orchestrated.   I went to the bar to get a drink and you would have thought that I was invisible. The bartender made eye contact with me at least six times and just flipped her head and went elsewhere.  When I did manage to get someones attention, I was told that they were out of Rose. I never got offered anything else.  I might come back when they are not busy and see if the flow and food are any better. If you are 21 to 28, this is probably your seen on party nights.  #vino2 #vinosquared #vino2ultimate"}
{"text":"Went to el hefe yesterday for Sunday lunch. We originally wanted to go to whiskey row but they sent us across the street because they were packed. Walked into el hefe, there were only two other parties there other than us. We were excited to get fast, efficient service but got just the opposite. There were four waitresses and one bartender. We sat at the bar. It took 15 minutes for the bartender to even acknowledge we were there. When she did, she did not say hello and ask what we wanted, she stood there staring at us. We told her our order. It took another ten minutes for her to pour our drinks. She thought it was more important to go check her phone first. The waitresses and the bartender were on their phones the whole time acting like they didn't even care to attend to the people in the restaurant. Keep in mind, there's only two tables there and we were the only ones sitting at the bar. It was VERY disrespectful and unprofessional. We got up and left. As people were coming in, we told them to not even bother. I will never be back, nor will I recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting a ton from the food at El Hefe, a newish Old Town Scottsdale spot serving up Mexican eats. I figured the bar, which turns into a hopping nightlife destination on weekend nights, would be more notable for its drinks than its cuisine, and I was right.  Not that the place doesn't look hella cool. It had lots of hot pink accents, including pink lighting and pink walls, which I loved even though it sort of reminded me of the now-closed Pink Taco.  I also thought the art-covered skateboards covering up the walls were neat, as well as the giant drawings of a Mexican wrestler and a Dia de Los Muertos-like skull adorning one of the walls.  Don't go there just to dine, though. While there were lots of televisions broadcasting sports, and the margaritas were impressive, I was left wanting a lot more with the food. It was too bad the $8 house margarita, at a whopping 20 ounces, couldn't set the standard for the meal, since that drink was such as killer deal.  The chips and salsa weren't too bad. The chips were nothing to shout about, but I liked that they were served on a cute cutting board spread along with three different types of salsa-chunky and mild, green and a spicy red. I did like the salsas, although I would have preferred the chips were a little thinner. They were only $3, though, which was pretty cheap, although most places would serve them up for free.  My friend and I tried a couple of the Grilled Mushroom Calabacitas tacos ($3 each). They were filled with lots of veggies, including zucchini and onions, but they were bland and sort of awkward to pick up and hold because the tortillas were tiny compared to the filling. Add a ton of salsa to them to give them a little kick.  We also each had a cheese quesadilla ($7 each). The quesadilla was pitifully tiny, and it was served on wax paper, which caused all the melted cheese to get stuck. These were one of the biggest rip-offs I've had, and the presentation was very bare bones, despite the addition of unappetizing pickled baby carrots and a drizzling of goat cheese creme.  There were a couple other things to note about the visit-the napkins at El Hefe seemed to be coming apart and left white threads all over my friend's and my jeans-not cool if you're planning on going clubbing in Old Town later. The bartender checked his cell phone more than he checked on us-clearly, we weren't his first priority. And the menu was really difficult to read, with backwards letters and all-caps. I know that's a weird thing to notice, but just looking at it gave me a headache.  All that said, skip El Hefe for dinner, and head to the cute and trendy spot for happy hour every day from 3-7 p.m., when those giant margaritas are only $5. Enjoy the ambiance while you drink, and go to here, here, or here in Old Town for dinner instead.  UPDATE: Justin, the director, reached out to me about my review, which I think is very classy and shows that he values customer service. I'm going to try out their dining options again, for sure."}
{"text":"We fixed the problem they were really nice and understand about the problem. We live this place, it's honestly one of the best places on mill ave."}
{"text":"Jake was awesome! Honestly best service we have had since being in Tempe! All bartenders in this area should be like him! Fast and attentive!"}
{"text":"Seems like a fun environment here on a Saturday night depending on what kind of crowd you like however the drinks here suck.  It's mostly sugared water with tiny bits of alcohol charging $21 for two drinks.  Tasted gross."}
{"text":"Bueno !  Hefe Hamburguesa (angus beef, grilled peppers and onions, jalapeno marmalade, queso, & chipotle mayo) = so good .  Pollo Torta (jalapeno jam, cheese, avocado, baja slaw) =good   totally happening place, fun vibe . Beer-garita 's surprisingly good .  $2  taco's and $5 marg's for HH"}
{"text":"This venue was not our initial stop when visiting but we decided to stop by because it seemed to have a good crowd. They have a Lyft pickup area right outside the entrance so that's a plus. I was with a party of 5 & being the only one from outside the state I should have went first when trying to get in but I was at the end. The security guard at the front checked my id & all & waited a moment then told me I could not get in because of my sneakers.  First of all this appears to be more of a bar style venue that has indoor & outdoor areas & I don't recall seeing a dress code sign anywhere but it made for a disappointing night because everyone else really wanted to go there but they understood that I couldn't get in so we left & went elsewhere."}
{"text":"Here's a tip about 5-Star Yelp reviews:  When they start getting extremely specific about deals, specials, and how you can sign up for text alerts, 10/10 times they are written by employees driving the average rating up and bumping negative reviews down the page.  As evidenced by this page, El Hefe has clearly encouraged their employees to leave good reviews talking about salad and taco specials to compensate for the customer reviews about their establishment.  Now, as for my experience...  In line at about Midnight, I witnessed an individual be told 'hey man, sorry but no basketball shoes in here' and was told the same thing once I reached the front of the line.  Being a logical person, I look not for coincidences but for patterns, and the pattern here was curious being that there were clearly people inside the venue wearing flip flops, Chuck Taylor sneakers, Vans, and yes, 'basketball shoes.'  So where is the pattern?  What made those individuals exempt from the 'basketball shoes' rule?  Well, myself and the gentleman who were refused were both of African descent, while the individuals inside were of European descent.  Again, this is simply a pattern that is only logical to reach.    When I asked about the 'basketball shoes' policy, each bouncer had a different response.  \"Oh, flip-flops and Converse are ok\" said one bouncer.  Another was aboslutely incredulous that I had noticed the pattern of race in the equation and said that Air Maxes were acceptable but not basketball shoes.  When I pointed out that I was wearing Air Max 1s, he was befuddled and stammered out a barely coherent response.    Every dollar spent is a vote cast, and I won't be voting for a racist establishment anymore.  I've included in the album a picture of the European individual clearly wearing 'basketball' shoes."}
{"text":"This place is the worst. Bartenders suck and the bouncers are terrible. Employees feel entitled and don't value your customers. But what do you expect. It's lame club in old town made for people who aren't legal to even drink."}
{"text":"Decent college bar.  We rolled in on a Sunday afternoon to grab a quick bite while we were walking around downtown Tempe.  It's weird to write this, because I know it's sort of like saying \"I'm going back for the toast,\" but the chips and salsa were fantastic.  I mean really worth getting.  The wife had tacos which she liked a lot and I had some kind of breakfast skillet that was good not great.  The staff was really friendly and quickly took care of an issue where the wrong dish was brought out to us.  It's also a cool patio right on the main drag.  I'll probably be back for tacos and margs at some point."}
{"text":"Stopped in to have a drink with a group of friends.  Watched the bartender \"Haylee\" drop a glass that shattered in the ice bin.  She proceeded to scoop out ice and finish the margarita she was making instead of melting the ice down and wiping the entire bin clean insuring it is free of any glass. After watching this, the group of 20 of us decided to leave.  I just hope that the person who received the margarita didn't have any shattered glass in their cup.  Will not be coming to this establishment again and hopefully the bartender receives some education on proper bar protocols."}
{"text":"it's scottsdale, what did i expect. this newest \"it\" bar is just that...it's certainly popular. especially if you like threadbare designer t-shirts, fitted ball caps, perfectly \"messy\" hair, and big boobs.   i have to give props to the decor....really like the wall art and the floral/dia dos los mucho gusto tengo hombre meuertes (or something like that) theme. and if it's eye candy you want, come here. not an ugly person in the whole joint.   we were however, seated immediately, even at happy hour, but had to wait 10 minutes to get value on our living social coupon. i liked my margarita, but as a lightweight, i usually get buzzed after one, but i never felt that old familiar feeling. my lady on the other hand got the skinny margarita and it was mucho flaco on the tequila. good thing i was driving.   when we were finally able to order, i got the mushroom street tacos and the ceviche dish. i have to say, my food was good. small, but good. we probably would've done better price wise to eat and drink on happy hour, but no matter. my lady had the salad....big disappointment. first off, they ran out of shrimp....shrimp? there's a Fry's less than 2 miles away. second, it was just lettuce (ehem, mixed greens), about 2 small handfulls, with a few corn kernels and 3 pieces of plantain....for 9 bucks! thank goodness for no shrimp...then it would've cost 12! you know at oreganos, you can get a salad for 9 bucks that could be eaten for 2 meals! el hefe's salad was more like an appetizer. and our waitress, bless her heart. absolutely gorgeous but didn't know how to pronounce ceviche.  but what i just can't get over is the music....unbelievably loud. so loud in fact, i can just move my lips and pretend to talk and you would laugh and agree and nod your head because really, you'd have no idea what i was saying anyway. so it's not really a place for eating....more for clubbing.   overall, i liked my food, not impressed with my lady's food, and would go back, but i'm too old for that loud stuff...i like to actually listen to my gal talk. and i don't own any ed hardy/cool fight gear/designer jeans/fancy shoes."}
{"text":"Nice place to sit outside and watch sports if it's good weather! Service is a bit slow and the waitresses don't seem to care much.  Week nights its typical college hangout, decently priced beers and draft selection. The tortilla soup is HUGE! Don't plan on being hungry for more. Also, the tacos are a bit small but are great with some Cholua. I'd recommend the chicken."}
{"text":"A very nice place to get some Mexican food. The food is good quality, especially their tacos are good and known. I would recommend you to try their tacos for sure."}
{"text":"The few times I've been to El Hefe have all taken place during late nights, so I was pretty skeptical to come for the food on a weeknight evening.  Came to watch the Suns game and got a prime spot at the bar with no problem. It was Tuesday, so you know what that means..and if you don't, I'll give you a hint: Taco Tuesday. El Hefes TT specials were great--$2 tacos and $3 draft Dos Equis.   So there's the back story.. now for the food.  Their tacos were SO good. I mean, really, really good. If you go to Barrio Queen for this type of fare, stop. Don't go back there, you're getting ripped off. The tacos here were super flavorful, and they do not skimp on the meat. My new favorite taco spot!  Come here for tacos. And to make it even sweeter, come here on a Tuesday so you can get 'em for 2 bucks."}
{"text":"Have recently experienced the rudest security twice now here. First time was at James Kennedy's event where I nicely asked the El Hefe security if I could go outside because one of the people who worked with James told me he was doing a meet and greet. He said \"I don't care and you can leave\" and started to act like he was going to push me so that I would back up... like I can be treated like that for just asking a question!! And he could have said it nicely! Then my turn comes in the meet and greet and when I asked the security if my boyfriend could come in the picture with me they said no!? Second time with security here was much worse and actually frightening; a couple weekends ago when we went here to celebrate my friend's birthday, my friend was dancing and his seeing glasses fell on the floor as a security guard was walking by and the security guard totally just YELLED, no BARKED, in his face (literally sounded like a scary dog barking in his face) asking \"why the hell would you move like that when i'm clearly trying to walk by\"...... totally uncalled for yelling and honestly doesn't even make sense what the security was getting mad at!!!! I was afraid to even tell the security guard that my friend actually bent over to get his glasses... I knew that would hurt that security guard's ego and make him feel dumb and he probably would've just gotten even more mad at us for no reason lol! Come here if you want to get yelled at, have security guards power trip, and be rude to you for no reason."}
{"text":"Two words: Sunday Funday. A few more words: Any other day of the week. I frickin love this place. My goal in life is to become the Duchess.  ~SCOTTSDALE LOC IS BETTER THAN TEMPE LOC~"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure how to feel about El Hefe coming to Mill ave since I really liked Canteen But it is nice and the layout is still the same, I like the pink scheme Courtney is an absolute doll behind the bar If you have the chance, ask for her and she will take care of you  El Hefe has a great happy hour The house margs are only $5 The also have drafts pretty cheap as well  I shall return and hopefully try the food"}
{"text":"Went out to el Hefe for the NBA Finals game the other night and had a blast! Great food, swift bartenders and all-round good vibes! Also dog friendly!"}
{"text":"Sexist. Turned down a girl for wearing cute ass boots because they didn't have a heel. Really? There was girls in there wearing sneakers. I'd recommend much better friendlier bars in the area. C.A.S.A. is a wonderful alternative"}
{"text":"it was a fun place. I ended up having dinner here. Good taco's and nice place to people watch. For sure would be back. The staff was very friendly. Great place to watch sports."}
{"text":"Went to this Bar last night to celebrate my birthday but wasn't able to because security judges you for your shoes so if you are wearing Jordans be expected to be turned away because they think you are going to cause troubles. Not worth it if they won't let you in because of your shoes. They're Jordans, I don't understand the issue? Tempe is NOT a ghetto place. Maybe you guys should include this in your dress code on your website instead of just saying the dress code is casual and people showing up wearing  stuff out of your \"dress code.\" Also you should stop letting people in with Nikes as well since it's the same company that makes Jordans. If you want to be specific with shoe types."}
{"text":"We were here five years ago from Seattle and anticipated our return. The place has changed for the worse. Loud thumping music, indifferent staff and a mediocre menu. Won't be back. Save your money."}
{"text":"So we stopped in after a 10 mile hike for a Cinco De Mayo lunch.  We were actually very impressed with the service, quality and price.  Attentive friendly staff keeps your glass filled.  I never think to get the picture taken before I start eating.  Sorry.  But we had 3 different soft tacos that were quite tasty."}
{"text":"Good but nothing special, food was quick and nice staff.  Ambiance is cool especially outside."}
{"text":"I had to knock this place down a star for being overly loud...with speakers above each booth it was a little obnoxious how loud this place was while the game was on. My table of 6 could barely carry a conversation without yelling across the table over the speakers.  The chips and salsa were mediocre but they did continue replenishing the chips until the salsa was gone thankfully. The tacos were amazing on the other hand. Definitely worth four stars on their own. I tried the Duck Carnitas, the Al Pastor, their Carne Asada and the Beef Cheek taco. I'd recommend each of them and twice on days ending in a Y.   The drinks were a little weak for the prices. I had the Bulldog-Garita with the mini bottle of Sol tipped upside down in the chalice....not very strong for a 32oz. marg....the Mexican Mule wasn't my favorite either. At $10 each just order beer or tequila or both.  All that aside service was tip top and the servers here are all attractive with ASU down the block. Worth a stop in for some great tacos outside the norm."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch.  Service was good, food was good (nothing worth returning for), and music was LOUD.  We had enchiladas and a chicken bowl.  The Chelada was the best one that I have ever had."}
{"text":"This is just a review of the atmosphere and service since I didn't try any of the food.  From the other reviews I thought my visit would have been better but there were a couple of issues that I found very annoying.  Pros:   The bartender who made my mojito was on point - she was smiling, provided quick service, and the drink was good.  Cons:   The layout of this place makes it difficult to socialize.  The aisles are narrow, the bar takes up too much room and it just feels small and crowded.  If you try to talk to someone sitting at a booth inside, all you will hear is \"excuse me\" every 3 seconds because there's no room to get past the tables. There also is a rude person who walks around making people get up from their bar stools and stand so they can take the chairs.  I had just ordered a drink and sat down at the bar when I was told I needed to get up.  Strangely, the people next to me at the bar eating were NOT told to get up.  Not cool. WTF is with hiding the bathroom door??  Do you think I want to look like an idiot staring at a wall and NOT seeing the door?  Douchebaggery at work.  If I decide to go back (and that's a big if) I will try some of the food and update this review.  Let's just say I'm in no hurry to return though."}
{"text":"As a nightclub, I think this place is tops. It is the club that started a new fad in Old Town, inspiring other, newer clubs to be more like it with indoor/outdoor setups, plus the taps built into the tables is a cool concept. The servers there are friendly and the place is fun. So what's not to like? Well, I was completely underwhelmed with the food our table had ordered.  The burgers were dry and the portion size of the sides were very small. The prices were a little high as well. We left there feeling ripped off a little, with no intentions of returning for future dine-ins."}
{"text":"Got assaulted here on Cinco de Mayo. Security wasn't as responsive as they should have been so my assailant got away. That was my first and last visit. I went here because their music was the loudest that night and it was super crazy. Fun at first, but I went home mad and covered in beer. The dancers were super hot though!"}
{"text":"Worst customer experience ever, agree with all the other reviews!!  Gee, trend showing?  People that work there only care about their friends, not paying customers. Predict this place dead in 6 months. Miss the canteen."}
{"text":"Fun cantina in Scottsdale. Good fun vibe close to Axis/Radius and within stumbling distance of The W. The service is attentive and friendly. The food looks yummy but I was too busy drinking. They have tables that have their own beer taps. Would love to get a group and try that out. The Beergarita (Coronita in a jumbo margarita) is a must try."}
{"text":"There isn't an option for less than one star so in order to leave a review at all, I guess I have to give them one.  First off, I called all around Tempe and Chandler looking for a place that would take a reservation for the boxing match. El Hefe gladly took the reservation over the phone - the customer service had me really smiling at that point! We were told that the reserved tables are usually expected to spend about $200 between food and drinks, sounded pretty reasonable for two couples who love boxing, food and beer so we took it. Our waitress was super good to us and the food runners were on top of things.  One huge problem that started to trash the night was when one of the security staff demanded to remove us from our reserved table and argued with my boyfriend about it - all the while our cups and plates had been cleared! We had been there at the same table for two hours, simply got up to use the restroom and came back to that.  The place was packed naturally, so we had to pretty much \"defend\" our space from others who didn't have a table.  Minutes after the fight ended I got my tab back - $356!!!! $150 over what I was quoted multiple times over the phone. While trying to add up the difference and figure out what a \"table surcharge\" is, our table was being cleared and broken down right in front of us. I tried to at least get my cup of water back from the guy and he was a total snot and kept it anyway. It was a huge rush to get us out of there, like we were in a cattle barn.  After finding a spot to speak with the guy who took my reservation, without having to scream over the music, he finally came back with a tab for $225. Fine, it's the amount we agreed upon anyways. I check my bank statement today and find out I got charged the $356 anyway!!!! I never signed for the larger tab, only the small one, still tipped our waitress and thanked the manager for lowering the bill - seriously??? How can I still get charged whatever they felt like?? Needless to say we won't be giving them any more business; they have enough for a few families on my tab alone. I wonder how many times that's happened??"}
{"text":"Worst place I ever been to, sorta. I drove up in my motorcycle and park in the spots outside of the place. Then was denied entry for having a motorcycle because they're thought I was in a motorcycle gang. Wtf, really? They're excuse was thinking I was going to cause a fight there. I advise anyone to not drive up in a motorcycle or else they won't let you in."}
{"text":"This is my favorite new bar in Scottsdale.  The wall art is awesome and the music is always right on for my \"going out\" mood.  It gets super packed so if you're planning on going on a Friday or Saturday night get there early so you don't have to fuss with the lines.  It's definitely a party hard or go home type of place so be ready to boogie down if you step foot in the door."}
{"text":"barmaids look like hookers. what more do you want?"}
{"text":"I was here for a happy hour event and especially liked the tacos and the friendly service.  Have you ever had duck tacos?  Neither had I until I tried them at EH.  Very tasty and a nice change from the usual taco choices.  The nachos were great as well and the three dollar Dos Equis' on tap was the perfect libation."}
{"text":"Courtesy of Kevin B.  El Jefe is a great place to hang out with the boys during the World Champion San Francisco Giants Spring Training.    It is a stone's throw away from Scottsdale Stadium and the place has a fine selection of beers and margaritas.  El Hefe would be a 5 star in my book if they served more Budweiser products, but it is what it is.  I will definitely come back with Cella when she is invited to spring training.  Thanks El Hefe!"}
{"text":"Seriously the beer margarita is genius! And if you're looking for good tacos or a place for taco Tuesday this is your place!!"}
{"text":"Love El Hefe! Tacos are always fantastic especially the Mahi! Tacos are not just for Tuesday at El Hefe."}
{"text":"Ruined my driver's license. Has a protocol of testing suspicious forms of I.D. that involves folding and subsequently creasing the license, leaving it rendered useless and unscannable. Wait staff is immature with bimbo girls and meathead guys. No plans to ever return here."}
{"text":"I love going there on my lunch break! Awesome vibe, yummy food, and the drinks are to die for! Do yourself a favor and try the Cucumber Margarita.. SO GOOD.   I haven't been there much at night but the few times I've passed by its always packed and so crazy. Great music and awesome drink specials!"}
{"text":"This place feels like a tacky strip club that happens to serve tacos. It also somehow turns into a nightclub with a DJ and stuff at night.   Good lingua tacos though, to be fair.   Not sure if I'd recommend, but probably not."}
{"text":"As soon as I saw a sugar skull on the sign, I knew I was destined for the place.  Just as you cannot judge a book by it's cover, you cannot judge a restaurant on it's signage.  Luckily for me, cool sign aside, I was loving everything I tried.  Even the presentation was impressive.  They serve the tacos on a large branded butcher block.    Do not miss the Yelp check in bonus!  Our table got free guac and elote dip.  Both were double dippablly good.  I would order both again in a heart beat.  I'm not even a guac person and was all over this dip.  The braised beef cheek taco was super tender and juicy.  The chicken tinga taco with its passion fruit salsa, jicama relish, lime crema and hint of chorizo was addictive.  For their al pastor, they braise a pork shoulder, and it's full of flavor from the pineapple salsa.  I could eat these tacos- every day.  All day.  El Hefe (The Boss) Supermacho Taqueria also has some pretty good margs.  I stuck with the happy hour house marg but the salty chihuahua with jalapeno and hermanos pistola with cucumber pique my interest.  The place was pretty rowdy and this was just during a week night dinner.  I gather at night this becomes a club.  Who would have ever thought that a club would serve some of the best tacos I ever had.   They passed around crazy mustaches and we got some hilarious selfies.   While, it was not the best place to dine with a baby, we were with a group and made it work.  However, the food was so good, I would tempt fate again and bring her in the future, if it meat I got my hands on these boss tacos!"}
{"text":"If I could go down into the negatives, I would. My friend (Who has special needs) and I tried to order but kept getting ignored. When i reported the poor  service,  I got told that the employees would never behave accordingly and it must be my misunderstanding. How unfortunate that all the on hand level ups would feel that I'm at fault. They all threatened to kick me out for making an issue of the matter."}
{"text":"Fairly tasty food, if it's hot but HORRIBLE service with mindless employees.  First, I have to say the service here is typical of what you may expect when you have college students (particularly ASU) as employees.  For the guys, the girls where short shorts with cheeks exposed if that is what you are looking for.  However, you trade that for service.  The staff's collective IQ is less than that of an average college student and it's difficult to communicate with them, loud ambient noise aside.  A busboy (Brent) just walks around expressionless, flexing his muscles and acting as though he absolutely hates being there. The other, shorter, shorter busboy was the only one there with a personality and should have been waiting tables.    The DJ just hits on the waitresses the whole time while blurting out the occasional \"Sup Bruh\" when is friends come in.  I am a fan of loud (good) music but a lot of patrons were complaining, not that the music was horrible (which it was - EDM) but that it was SO loud you couldn't communicate with anyone who worked there much less the people sitting in close proximity to you at your table.  They charge you for chips and salsa, which is ok I guess.  After all, you can't make money if college students just come in and drink beer for dinner while filling up on free chips and salsa.  However, they charge you an extra $1 for every \"Shot Glass\" of salsa you order.   And I do mean \"shot glass.\"  These things are tiny and only allow you to eat about 10 chips per order of salsa.  They were out of glass pint glasses so my first beer came in a plastic cup.  The waitress said the bartender said they were the same size, 16 ounces.  No way.  I finished it and poured my next pint (in a real glass) in to the plastic cup an there was still 2 oz. left in the glass. So....the plastic cups are 14 ounces.  However, I was not charged for the first beer since I made a stink but others should be aware of the gimmick.  Bottom-line, this place is always packed, which is why we tried it.  Just be prepared for bad service and the staff  being more interested about how they look versus the service they provide.  The food was pretty good but half of it was coldish and inconsistent."}
{"text":"Great time and service! They gave us free champagne and a table for our bachelorette party. Thanks for a good time!"}
{"text":"I want to keep this short and sweet but that may be difficult.  I will start by saying I am not a yelp reviewer, I don't leave reviews because I'm not bored and I don't think anyone will go or not go somewhere based on what I say. My friends and I arrived in Tempe on 3/15 and headed to El Jefe, starving and ready to start our vacation.  We had queso fundito, carne asada fries and guacamole, all amazing.  Our server Hailey seemed a bit flustered, it was taking a while to get drinks etc, but we are pretty easy going so just kind of let it go.  Once she had a few extra minutes to come talk to us we realized that she was covering for people that didn't show up to work so we all got it, we've all been servers at some point.  But when we called Hailey she responded, as quickly as she could.  We had lots of drinks, shots food, at this point we've been there about 7-8 hours with no reason to ever leave.   When Hailey was finally cut we closed our tab.  I don't know the exact amount because one of our wonderful friends grabbed it but I have heard stories and it's pretty legendary going forward, but I believe it was around $700 (Thank you Hailey, you were amazing!) We stayed another 2-3 hours, more food, more drinks, more shots.  We closed another tab at about $200 or so and some of us left.  Our last soldier arrived, had some food, more drinks and another $100 tab paid.   Let me be clear...we LOVED El Jefe.  Every time we walked past we looked for Hailey but if she wasn't there we moved on bc there are 100 bars on Mill Street and we were on a 5 day trip. Sunday evening...we'd been out to lunch, met some friends in Phoenix and when we came back to the hotel decided we wanted some of those carne asada fries and that queso so headed to El Jefe.  I'm gonna say, we had been drinking, we were not sober.  However, we were very coherent, we are old white women, we don't go stumbling around like 21 year olds drinking ourselves stupid and it was about 6pm.  We sit at the bar, which is literally full and completely male, the testosterone was all over the floor.  My friend had a drink in her hand from our last stop which she hadn't even realized or thought about.  When our bartender came over we ordered our food, he entered it and came right back to get our drink order.  I ordered, another friend ordered, and my friend with the drink told the bartender oh I guess I have the one I brought.  He grabs the cup, says I can't serve you.  Says as a matter of fact i can't serve any of you.   I'm sorry....what?  Your bar is full, FULL of loud, drunk frat boys screaming at the TV's.  At first we just laughed thinking he was joking because it was so ridiculous but he was extremely rude.  We cancelled our food order and walked out.  This jagoff actually chased us down outside while we were deciding where to go next asking what we were going to do about our food order (our 3 minute old food order) we told him we won't do anything and how disrespectful he was treating us and to check the receipts from Thursday and what a mistake he made.  My friend pointed out the bar was full of drunk frat boys and that she was honest about bringing the drink in inadvertently and what a mistake he just made and we would never be back.  He told us that WE were disrespectful for ordering food we won't pay for.  Anyone that has ever worked in any kind of restaurant or bar with food knows that cancelling an order is literally nothing...especially when it's crowded and there is no way they even started that food. Because we were starving we just went around the corner to Jimmy Johns to get sandwiches.  And this is where it got really messed up...we are in line and this guy comes in the back door of JJ's with a bag of our food drops it on the floor next to us and rushes off. He literally stalked us to Jimmy John's??  REALLY?  Maybe he was making a statement, he failed.  We brought the bag right outside and handed it to the homeless guys out front. They loved it! Got our JJ sandwiches, went back to hotel bar and enjoyed a cocktail or 2 and turned in.  This guy is an arrogant, sexist, probably ageist as well (never underestimate old white women...ask Hailey!) d-bag who truly needs to address his mommy issues.  It's really sad because we loved this place, and the food and drinks are amazing, but unless you're a cute coed you may want to pick a table in the corner out of sight or you may be \"cut off\" to make room for someone they deem worthy. So disappointing, it really broke our hearts I'm not gonna lie.  To be disrespected like that was embarrassing, and extra upsetting after we spent like $900 already.   The star is for Hailey!! Otherwise a big fat ZERO stars"}
{"text":"It's a fun place!! Always packed and a good time"}
{"text":"3rd time here for lunch and every time I am blown away.    They put a spin on Mexican food that just flat out works.  This is not what I would think of as a lunch place, but wow.  The food is flat out great!  I mean award winning good.  The service is outstanding.  I only had water last time and I think there was only one that my cup was half full.  By the way, the water there taste good, I have not Idea how, but it does.  The are very accommodating to special requests and to large groups.  I have yet to use the beer taps they have on their table, but that seem like an obvious win.  I would put this in my top 10 places to eat lunch, and that is saying a lot."}
{"text":"My bartender Austin fully explained the menu. I ended up trying the the fajita combo! Great presentation and taste; although it is a bit pricy. This may become a regular lunch spot for me."}
{"text":"My brother recommended that I try this place and I was a little skeptical based on the website alone. I thought it was a club or something. I went anyway and was soooo glad I did. The food is so damn good. I still think about it all the time! LOL! Why not 5 stars? It's so loud in there that you have to scream to have a conversation. It's a great place to watch the game and to hang out. Perhaps the outside seating area is a little quieter. Definitely give this place a try; you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time going out in Tempe and was recommended to come here. While waiting in line security walked up to me and said my shoes were not part of dress code. I was wearing a brand new pair of Jordan's. It didn't make sense because there were people in line with older Jordan's that looked rundown and other shoes like vans and converse that looked like they were dragged across the ground with scuff marks and dirt all over them. I understand there's dress code but to not call others in the same brand shoe out or allow people with busted shoes in just doesn't make sense. Maybe I'll wear pajamas and sandals next time and I'll definitely get in. If I try this location again."}
{"text":"Sometimes in life all we need is a 2nd chance to make it right!   Visited El Hefe this past weekend and had a great experience. Service was top notch, food came out quickly, and the drinks certainly were the highlights.   If you noticed my prior review, I am pleased to share the entire staff, management, and everyone we encountered was polite, friendly, and very accommodating.   Jessica served us and she was a delight! Very attentive and made our experience really sweet.   Guys-- the eye candy at El Hefe is reason enough to go... And if you're planning on bringing your lady, just keep your eyes glued on your date so you don't get in trouble drooling... Because this place may be one of the best places to watch any game, fight, or match on their huge and many TVs.   The selection of tequila & beer should meet any preferences or demands. We drank Casa Noble and had a delish margarita. Very good!!!   The food is a big step up from typical bar food, but don't expect authentic Mexican cuisine. They offer a great selection of tacos and snacks to pair your appetite for drinks. We loved the macho nachos and there's no way 2 people can eat all those chips piled high with all that yummy cheesy goodness. For a sun night out or to watch any exciting game, you will enjoy the snacks and the killer drink selection.   Coming back a second time, I made sure to seek out the management crew and shared my thoughts about my experiences. My biggest advice is seek out Rob, Erik, or Jamie if anything is either really good or really bad-- these guys truly care about the customer experience, and are striving to make El Hefe remarkable.   While I had my doubts, I am a fan and will be back during my visits to AZ!   Cheers..."}
{"text":"El Hefe is the place to be for good food and cold beer. They have a wide selection of beers on draft and craft beers. The fried avocado tacos and quesadilla are awesome. Ask for Nicole and she will take care of you."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, and it was during peak party hours on a Saturday night. I was NOT expecting that crowd in oldtown Scottsdale. I felt like I was in Vegas! People everywhere, girls in tight, short, dresses, wasted dudes. Yup. Vegas in Arizona.   The floor was sticky. Maybe it had to do with the gogo dancers pouring shots directly into patrons mouths as they stood on the bar. Nothing against that- I thought it was pretty cool. I might have taken a few myself."}
{"text":"This place is a shit hole. First of all its run down and one of the dirtiest places I've been in. Tried to sit at a table and they told us they were all \"reserved\" after 10 pm in which no one sat in them the entire time we were there. Then as I was sitting at the bar I had my chair pulled out from under me as I was told it was a \"club\" night. There was probably 75 people in the entire place at this point. When I asked the bartender if they didn't allow people to sit at their bar he immediately threaten to \"cut me off.\" I told him no need as I would take my business elsewhere. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone in their right mind."}
{"text":"We were invited to have drinks and watch the Mayweather fight at El Hefe located in Old Scottsdale.   My husband and I are both professionals. (RN & Law Enforcement) As you walked up to El Hefe, we were greeted by two security guards one with (beard & hat ) and one who was (slightly taller with the beard).   We were both excited with our ID's out and ready.   The security guard (beard & hat) in his nicest voice stated to my husband that he couldn't get into El Hefe because he had on high top sneakers.   We weren't happy but we obliged as we walked back to the car. We can hear our friends yelling  \"Are you guys coming back?\" Of course we are...  We walked to the car (which was two blocks away) and my husband changed into a different pair sneakers.   We walked back to the front of the line at El Heffe and the security guard w/ (tall w/ beard) states that \"We couldn't get in because of my husband's sneakers\".    WAIT.......Are you kidding me!  We were just here 10 minutes ago and spoke to the first security guard (beard & hat) who stated \" if you change your sneakers to lower top sneakers, you can get it\".    \"Is this a joke\" I stated. As I'm standing there  I looked to my left and there's two young Asian gentleman one had high top sneakers on and he was will denied access into the El Hefe.   The security guard proceeds to tell me that another security guard had gotten fired because he let someone into the club with high tops on. At that moment, I had sympathy and empathy for the security guard and the situation he was put into!    We were ready to leave......  Well to my surprise, two caucasian gentleman come walking out with (You..Guessed it)  HI TOP SNEAKERS!!! I was INFURIATED!!!!!   I looked at  the security guard and said  \"Ok, Now those two Caucasian gentlemen can out with high top sneakers on because I wasn't the security guard that let them in!!!  WHAT!!! I'm a little confused\"!! My husband said \"Look (showing his badge) I'm an officer of the law all I want to do is see the fight it shouldn't be a problem.   All of the sudden the Asian gentleman to the left of me whisper in my ear \"Watch this\"! He tells the security guy \"I'm gonna buy bottles so I suggest you let me in or I'm going to take my business elsewhere\"!!!  The security guard immediately disappears into the back...two minutes later he's telling us all to wait on the side while the manager (Bottle table Mgmr).   A dark haired young gentleman comes out and states \"Are you really going to buy a bottle\" the Asian gentleman said \"Yes, I'm definitely going to buy a bottle\" And I'm sure you guessed it!!!!! WE were ALLOWED into the club an ASIAN and a AFRICAN AMERICAN with HIGH TOP SNEAKERS ON!!!! We were personally escorted  into the club by the table bottle manager.   We ordered Ciroc with a craft of cranberry and seltzer water, nachos, loaded fries.... Etc! All of a sudden we're being treated like ROYALTY not like the MINORITIES who had on HiGH TOP SNEAKERS!!!!  People.....we're in 2015..... Do minorities still have to buy bottles and have tables service to enjoy what we all should get  EQUALLY!!!!!   El Heffe really made a bad choice in discriminating on the wrong people last night; little did they know people know people... DIDDY, Sickamore, DE..... Etc...If you known the entertainment business you know word gets around. I would NEVER, EVER GO BACK!!!!!   We the people ( every ethnicity )help these establishment to make money! I would treat every person like their worth TABLE SERVICE!!!!  It's about treating people fairly and equally and El Hefe didn't do that.....!!!!"}
{"text":"I like this place but they are racist. They wouldn't allow my Jamaican friend in on multiple occasions for different reasons. 1 time it was his shoes another it was because he has dickies black shorts on.

{"text":"Mr. T dancing on the bar on weekends is fun to see. Dancing bar- not chill.  Techno, and some Latin music.  Avg priced drinks for old town.  The girls doing beer bongs for ppl on the bar- cool to see but It feels like a college flashback.  The crowd was rude, snobby. Very much felt like I was in a BIG FRAT HOUSE PARTY.  The bouncers were nice.  :)  If you want to avoid the LONG ass line, have a girl with you and ladies have your cleavage out and hair extensions in!"}
{"text":"This is the best taco spot west of the Mississippi. There's also this sweet lil thang named Missy that works behind the bar. One of these days I'm gonna work up the courage to ask her out on a date but until then, I'll be eating tacos every Tuesday at El Hefe for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"Love this place! Came in for their famous Sunday Funday party and had a great time. Their host Garrett was super accommodating and helped us out throughout the night. The servers were all beautiful, best looking in town for sure! We ended up staying all night, the place never died out. I will definitely be coming back here more often! Oh and the tacos are life changing."}
{"text":"I wanna start off by saying that I'm a huge fan of El Hefe in Scottsdale. You get what you pay for there, and I'm totally ok with that! In fact, I reserved a table for my graduation at the Scottsdale location, instead of the Tempe location which is where my university is located. Why? Glad you asked!  I've been to El Hefe Tempe more than I'd like to admit. It really is a fun place, don't get me wrong. I think you have to mentally and physically prepare for how crowded it is on Thursday-Saturday nights. If you're not a few (or several) shots in, don't bother going. This place is a nightmare with trying to get drinks. The bartenders at the main bar try their best to get to everyone but there's always way too many people. I am always prepared to wait 15-20 minutes for a drink (on a good night). The back bar by Public House is a little faster, I recognized a bartender there from her working at previous bars in the area. She's fast, makes drinks really well, and in my opinion, is mainly why that back bar was doing so well (move her to the main bar! blonde girl with shoulder length hair).  The bar by the front patio is the one I have the most problems with. There's only one bartender there, always a guy. Every time I go there I have to wait way longer that any of the other bars to get a drink. Throw another bartender in there! That one male bartender always has a huge attitude and serves other people who wait less than I do. This happened to me twice last week on two different days.   In addition to bar service, this place is CRAZY packed. You really have to be careful and not step on anyone's toes here, this place is that crowded. Good luck trying to dance, there's simply no room! Another big issue I have is the bathroom. There's no enforcement to the line and girls cut like crazy. Even if the \"bathroom bouncer\" sees it happen he doesn't do anything about it. I kid you not I've waited at least 20 minutes to get into the bathroom. Ladies if you have to pee go before you come here! Somewhere else might be a little cleaner too. I haven't ordered food from this location yet but I have at the Scottsdale location, I'll update this review once I've ordered tacos from Tempe Hefe.   I think these are the main reasons I didn't want to celebrate my graduation at Tempe Hefe. My experience there is always so-so and never gets to the level of fun I have at the Scottsdale location. I don't think El Hefe Tempe is completely awful, it just needs a little more improvement."}
{"text":"Fun night watching the Cubs playoff game on the big screen. The Mahi tacos and fried avocado tacos were delicious, the beer was cold and prices very reasonable.  Aubree was a great waitress and I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Great tacos and drinks during the day and awesome energy during the night. My favorite bar by far on Mill avenue"}
{"text":"The service here was really bad. Wait staff is very inattentive. The food was ok but we waited so long to get it no one had much of an appetite when it showed up."}
{"text":"**Vegetarian Friendly**  Came in for taco Tuesday and had such a great time! All of their tacos are $2 all day. This place is very different from daytime to nighttime.   Appetizer: chips and guacamole  It's free with the Yelp check-in! Big enough to share with 2-3 people, but also delicious enough to eat all by yourself.  Taco: Fried Avocado  I got my carnivore-loving friend to order this taco and loved it. Ask for a side of the mango passion fruit salsa and grilled pineapple salsa. Both are very different flavors but add a great taste to the taco.   I wish their menus/advertising was updated. Their menu states frozen and on the rocks margarita, but they only offer on the rocks. They advertised $6 margarita of the month, but they don't offer those anymore either."}
{"text":"Best tacos, best margaritas, make sure to ask for Seth or Anabel, best service ever :)"}
{"text":"This spot is perfect for a Sunday Funday or  a Friday night out. A group of my girls from ASU stopped in and got a table. We got a few free bottles and danced our asses off! I will definitely be coming back. Everyone here is super cool and is down for a good time."}
{"text":"Place is a lot of fun, it's always extremely packed! I don't think I've ever seen it not extremely packed!"}
{"text":"Great place. Busy, loud, fun, modern. What a sweet place to hangout. Where can you get bottle service, of a keg of beer?  Yep, here is right. These guys spent some money to make this place first class. How about a stage above the bar idea.  Just creates a great vibe for everyone. Girls dressed for Vegas, to guys just looking to hang out. I will be back"}
{"text":"dead. walk in, out to patio. not a single person in sight. server cleaning off table tells us to walk back to host stand to have the host bring us out and sit down on the patio. instead of a simple I'll grab some menus for you! Wow! customer service is getting amazing these days...."}
{"text":"Alyssa was our bartender this week super rude! Very condescending,  Thanks Missy first and last time  Thanks"}
{"text":"The food here was pretty good the service was awesome had a server by the name of Christina that was on point with her service. Would definitely go back to the place just due to the service."}
{"text":"El Hefe looks like a good place and the decor is fairly hip... Although it does seem out of place on Mill and better suited for Scottsdale. At first glance the menu seems tasty and original, but upon first bite you quickly realize that it's all about appearances because the portions are small, expensive and aren't huge on flavor.  The bar is lame because they aren't even trying to highlight our amazing local breweries here in phoenix... The wait staff however is nice so that part is good.  Overall, it's better to check out a real pub like Rula Bula."}
{"text":"If you can stomach the bottled blonde atmosphere the food is pretty legit. I've been here several times both to party and to grab a bite. It's packed wall-to-wall weekend nights with liberated 20-something's, but pretty chill any other night. Get the guac and burger!"}
{"text":"Great food such a horrible service .... our waitress  was standing around at the bar playing with her hair for 20 mins didn't bother to turn around to come to our table to ask if we were ready or not ( this was around 1pm the restaurant was dead ) after 20 mins  she finally took our order we got our food and waited for our check I just got sick of waiting so we just went up to her and asked for our check. The food was really good like I said but service was just HORRIBLE!!!!!"}
{"text":"Tacos here are always very good. Madison our server was fantastic. She was super friendly and attentive. Her customer service was 5 stars!"}
{"text":"El Hefe \"THE BOSS.\" What better way to spend a Wednesday night or Friday night in Old Town Scottsdale?! Excellent beer and tequila selection. The servers and bartenders are all beautiful, and actually have brains, unlike majority of OT bars... The table service is always on point. Rachel (with the dark hair) is exceptional. Overall customer service is excellent. Sean Frantz and his team all do a great job for the company. If you like tequila, booty, and loud music, then welcome home.  If you don't like those things, then... Sorry? Maybe you suffer from a rare condition, who knows.   Obey the boss.  -H"}
{"text":"Tacos in happy hour are really good specially the Carne Asada tacos. Server was nice thanks Victoria."}
{"text":"I tried to go here, but the bouncer wouldn't let me in because of my out of state ID. I was visiting from South Dakota. I'm 23 years old! The bouncer was such a jerk about it. I called the manager and complained, just because the guy was so mean to me! He told me we could go find a cop and have them scan it, after I said that would be fine, he told me to leave. ??? No thankssss."}
{"text":"Massive bar, great food, but sort of small.  Tacos were a few bucks, alcohol was pretty cheap, and they have specials for Brunch on some days.  Usually a line to get in unless your a chick."}
{"text":"Great food!  Nice atmosphere. Good place to watch football game. Cool outside area. Steak fajitas were tasty!"}
{"text":"I thought the happy hour was decent, but its not a huge difference when its not happy hour. The service is decent too, but the tacos are really amazing. I loved it. Best one was probably the fish tacos, but everyone I know seems to let me know that the Scottsdale location is much better."}
{"text":"Being in the service industry i always pay close attention to servers and restaurants in general. After a long shift at work the other day a coworker and I went to have a drink and eat because we were absolutely starving and needed to wind down. We got a super sweet and cute waitress who was able to actually chat with us and constantly made sure our food and drinks and all around time was good. Along with her being so attentive, the manager working(super cute too) came by and made sure we were doing well and also gave us an industry discount without even saying anything to us, which was sweet. I highly recommend visiting this location"}
{"text":"This place is awesome during the summer, but I guess when schools back in session it just goes downhill. It's overcrowded, the music is getting shitty (they play shit you can't dance to) the line is super long!   I think this guy paid one of the security guards to let HIM into the LADIES restroom to get a BLOWJOB from some girl in the bathroom stall.   I walked in wanting to fix my makeup, then figured I should pee.... I saw something funny (a girl on her knees and a guy standing over her) the security was standing by the door he knew what was going on but didn't do anything until I pressured him to get them out.   I banged on the stall that the 2 were in and the guy getting the bj blew up on me and started cussing me out, at that point I was so pissed I just walked out and I think the security thought I was going to tell the manager or something bc he got told the couple that their time was up.   I get it it's a nightclub and people get ratchet, but damn. Keep it sleazy Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Was at ASU for grad day. Walking Mill deciding on lunch, a buddy and I decided to pop in here on reference of a bartending friend. Did not disappoint! We both got the tres tacos. The duck was by far my fav. Corn and fries were amazing. Think more sweet than spicy. Another guy next to me had the huge salad while his friend had the hefe dog.  Think they left happy too. The ladies couldn't have been more attentive. Only 'bad' thing was pretty average tap selection, when other places around offer more local. I think this place has definately made our lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Love the happy hour specials and the variety of tacos. The best taco is the fried avocado- so good! Crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. The other tacos are pretty good too. The guac is Delish. The service isn't great and can be rather slow at times."}
{"text":"This place is good. Maybe if you are a college student you would give this place five stars but since I am an old fart I go with four. The food was delicious. I got some kind of jicama salad and it was great. Also we got the chips and salsa as an appetizer and it was fun because they give you three different types of salsa. On balance, four stars is just about right for this place."}
{"text":"Got a table here(spent around 500$), the server poured drinks for everyone around the table(without consent from anyone) and multiple drinks for the people at the table. Basically she kept pouring out the drinks so that we would hurry up and leave so she could make more money on the next table and such. Poor service, I'll never ever go back again. The way it's ran is disgusting. I called management and they just say \"oh, I'm sorry I'll bring it up at our meeting\" umm....awesome. 500$ down the drain. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed this place.  My boyfriend and I were visiting Scottsdale for the weekend and I found this place on yelp.  It caught my attention with the fun atmosphere and the drinks!  I saw a picture of the salty chihuahua which is like a spicy margarita and I was sold!  We arrived on a Sunday but earlier in the day when there were less people.  But when we left I could tell the party was just about to get started.  We got carne asada fries and being from San Diego, where we basically INVENTED them, :) I was pleasantly surprised. They added like a green chile or nopales on top which I thought was a cute Arizonian touch. Our bartender/server was really awesome and attentive not to mention drop dead gorgeous. The girls that work here are all really pretty. Props to her though because she was so attentive and I really appreciate that. She had like a blue and green bikini top that looks like a bra. Anyway, such a cool area to visit if you're in scottsdale for the weekend and want to PARTY! :)"}
{"text":"This location is like the typical college club/bar; one problem I have is we got a table but strangers were in the space 24/7 and security doesn't really care. If you were to spend money and get a table, don't bother because people are literally dancing on the reserved tables and what little spaces there are behind the tables themselves. We used our table more as a table top to place our drinks and make our mix drinks more than anything which btw no one would want to pay extra just for a table to place your drinks.   TL;DR: Don't buy a table, it's an absolute rip off"}
{"text":"Great time for my brothers bachelor party. Food was alright but the atmosphere was great!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed my time at El Hefe regularly on the weekends but will not be returning. My friend from the East coast flew in and I wanted to show him a good time on Mill Avenue with one of my destinations being El Hefe. Upon arrival, my friend was turned away because of his expensive shoes because they were \"high tops.\" We took our business elsewhere and will continue to do so. No reason was given for the exclusion of his footwear and the short bouncer was very rude about it stating the manager on premise \"was not available.\""}
{"text":"Had a good time here, great staff, fun atmosphere, they were extremely busy during the super bowl, I am told this is the place to go during ball games, and will definitely be venturing back"}
{"text":"El Hefe is great for clubbing but for restaurant they are ok. Definitely could use more options on the menu but I've been here several times so I pick my favorites. They have a really good avocado taco that is unique and delicious. Service is good. My overall 3 stars is for the restaurant itself. Could use some work as far as offering more options."}
{"text":"Great service, being a soccer fan they really knew how to put on a party while also showing the world cup on their millions of tvs!"}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped by this joint after having a few drinks at the W.  It's a short walk, couple of blocks, away.  It was the middle of the week around 9 pm and the place was half full....good crowd, decent vibe.  We saddled up to a table near the bar and close to the patio.  We ordered a couple of drinks and people watched for an hour or so.  They serve a specialty Margarita here that's served in a large glass and a full Corona bottle turned upside down inside the glass, they call it a \"Beer-garita\".....it looks ridiculous.  Even more hilarious was the number of people who were walking around drinking this monstrosity....it reminds me of the tourists in Vegas who walk around with those giant tubes of Hurricanes or Margaritas....great people watching I tell ya!  Our server was very attentive and made sure our glasses remained full.  The music was pretty good too....a DJ was playing house/dance music.  Overall, it was a fun time.  Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"Went here on our lunch break. Looking for a quick bite. Started off nice and easy, we ordered our food and drank some water. After about 35min we realized we still hadn't received our food. Unfortunately the waitress made an error and didn't place the order. We left and decided to look for something else since we were short on time. Sadly we could not find anything to eat, so we gave up and walked back to our car which happened to be right in front of El Hefe. The manager on the shift saw us get into our cars and she ran out offering to give us our food to go and free of charge! We we're starving and thankful she saw us! A big thank you to El Hefe for going above and beyond for the free lunch, that was really nice!"}
{"text":"I got a chance to go here on a Wednesday night, and it was the craziest party in town.  The place was loud and filled with energy, which is just what I expected going in!"}
{"text":"The spot to be! They have great food I just love their decorations and what the girls wear. Got to meet the actors of Blue Mountain State here and it was the best day of my life haha! I always get the tacos and the bartenders are very experienced."}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs. If you want a good drink go some place else. We got 3 margaritas (top shelf) and the total was 42.00. The drinks weren't strong at all. This is my second time here and after the first time with mediocre service, I will not be returning. Unfortunate, because the food was pretty decent."}
{"text":"I was quite disappointed when they dropped the shrimp taco from the menu.  This was the best item they sold.  Haven't found anything else that wow'd me like that shrimp taco."}
{"text":"Alright, I love el hefe. I'm here EVERY Saturday night. I decided to give the whole taco Tuesday thing a try (I've never been to hefe early hours) The food was great, but service was HORRIBLE, I work in the restaurant industry, I'm a server as well I know how it is. The server did not ask how our food was *25-30 into the food, I felt bad I had to ask another server for more water and limes. Our whole table had no refills, plates were not cleared, while she did not acknowledge. I understand if you're busy, but please at least acknowledge your table, let them know. The food was great, but I've never experienced such horrible service. It was one thing after another. Spoke with a manager, Parker was nice and understanding hopefully he had a talk with our server. I don't know if I'll eat here again."}
{"text":"This place has a \"dress code\" which I noticed only applies to people of color. I was turned away at the door on a slow night and I saw 2 white men dressed the same as me: t-shirt, sneakers, and a jacket. All my clothes are in great condition. Glad I didn't have an opportunity to waste my money here."}
{"text":"Bar tender gave my friend tonic instead of a gin and tonic. Refused to put gin in it."}
{"text":"Happy hour tacos are $2 and quesadilla was 4 $4. Really yummy guac too it's a loud fun atmosphere on mill but fun for a week night!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I went for dinner and it wasn't as busy as other places. We sat at the bar and it took the bartenders a few minutes before they gave us menus & offered drinks. Once we ordered our drinks, it took about a good 10 minutes until our drinks got to us. The food was pretty good. They could run our food together since there was only two of us, but they ran them separately. The house margarita wasn't all that. I ordered another one and it took another 10 minutes to receive my drink. She made it before she forgot to give it to me so it sat there roughly 5 minutes before she remembered. It could be better. FOH staff needs to tune it up."}
{"text":"El Hefe is no boss when it comes to good food, good drinks, and good hospitality.  I went there today for taco Tuesday after seeing an acquaintance who works there advertise for it on Facebook. Now I know why he has to advertise for people to come to his own restaurant. We sat at a sticky table, had mediocre service, drank pre made margaritas that tasted watered down and weak, and then ate terrible food. Between the two of us, my friend and I ordered quite a few of their tacos. It just seemed like El Hefe took shortcuts everywhere. The tortillas were stale, the shrimp on the tacos tasted like it came frozen from a bag, the al pastor was not al pastor... One of my tacos literally tasted like vomit. I couldn't finish it and I'm one of the least picky eaters out there. We were still hungry after the tacos and ordered chips and salsa which were extra... Come on guys it's a Mexican restaurant/ bar. Anyways, the salsa was bland and I can't say I didn't see that one coming. I wouldn't go back. The servers seemed to have an attitude, no one smiled (I wouldn't if I had to work there either).  I tried to be friendly with our server and smile but she just seemed annoyed. There are so many other restaurants and bars to go to in Tempe that are so much more inviting! We should have gone to culinary dropout."}
{"text":"Tasty bloody Mary's loaded w snacks in the glass! On Sunday it's the Bears place for football. Spacious layout and lots of tv's to see your game. Enjoyed chips and guacamole w our Bloody Mary... now back to our cruise of mill street."}
{"text":"Great place! The food is always good and the service is great! They have a pretty good happy hour; definitely try the camarones tacos! We had Taylor for our server, and she was great!! Love the outside patio, too!"}
{"text":"Rude employees thinking they are too good to serve people and they have their noses so high up in the air. Last time i was here i almost ordered a hundred dollars in drinks and the bartender put them on the counter and then i continued to pay after that i left a tip and she tells me can you move to the side in a rude voice and then tells me to shoo, wish i could have taken the tip i gave her back so quick! Like who the hell do you think you are, will never be returning because im sure the employees will always have a stick up their ass"}
{"text":"We came in for the hotdog, street corn, and duck tacos but those things aren't on the menu anymore. The tacos we did get were really good though."}
{"text":"The pork alpastor = 1 thing and that's amazing! Stop in to check it out. If you are looking for a great place to rage on Sundays, then this is where you want to be. Great music, tons of chicks, and good food. What more could you ask for."}
{"text":"The service was unbelievably slow. We waited for about 20 min and the manager finally figured out we had not been helped and directed a server to help us. Even once we had the server, I could see the discomfort in her face every time she apologized and said our food should be right out. The food was \"ok\" nothing special. The only reason for 2 Stars was the great patio seating on Mill."}
{"text":"Crappy bartender put the worst taste in my mouth. I did write into them to express my sentiments. The lady bartenders only want males at the bar..."}
{"text":"I had a very poor experience last Sunday with a waiter. She was no where to be found 90% of the time. I was sitting at the table with about 8 other people and I stuck my card in there as we were all going to split up the tab. Heck I even whipped out my pen figuring I would make it easier on the poor girl and circled what items where mine as well as putting the last 4 digits of my card next to these items. We were all mid splitting up the card, got interrupted, turned around and what do you know someone snatched up the bill and put it ALL on my card. ALL 8 people's orders food drink ALL of it on my card. Some of the items I was charged for we didn't even receive as we had been \"forgotten\". So I ended up having to go through the hassle amongst 8 people's orders and my debit card and cash when this all could have been avoided if she hadn't so hastily ran to swipe my card out without even reading any notations I had made on the receipt or even simply asking if we were finished. It was all so quick and all so inconvenient. I had been to the Tempe location and I really enjoyed myself and the food. I really want to like this place but it just turned me off entirely to El Hefe."}
{"text":"I've contacted this manager Erik 2 times already regarding table information. Last week I gave it a shot even thought I knew it's been awhile since I've been to Hefe. No response- maybe he has a number. But when I did write my initial review to complain about my experience, I did contact Erik shortly after, and still no response.   Thank goodness my group of friends have gradually moved to different bars other than Hefe now. The only reason why we would visit Hefe, is to walk by it and say hi to our good pal Taylor.   Other than that, always treated horribly by bartenders and the security inside-they are so aggressive! And I wish the managers would be managers haha"}
{"text":"Pretty good. I would prefer to give it 3.5 stars though. I've been here enough to know that I like it overall. The tacos are fine, nothing special, but then again I wasn't expecting anything special. The drinks are of average price and decently strong. I've only been here on Fridays and Saturdays, both nights the DJ tends to spin pretty good music. It's VERY crowded during peak hours and the line can get somewhat long. More than once I've been overlooked at the bar and that's annoying. The bartenders do seem to be doing their best though during busy times. I know damn well one of their door guys recognizes me (my tattoo is very recognizable) and he got snippy with me when he was checking my ID and I had my sleeveless hoodie on during a rainy night. Policy I'm sure, but c'mon dude, I've given you a enough of my business for a better attitude.  Also, you should befriend the head of security, Corell. He's a super duper nice guy but will fuck you up if you mouth off!"}
{"text":"I was visting Tempe for the art festival last weekend and stopped by El Jefe for tacos and a drink. They had a lot of TVs and bartender was very nice. I noticed their very large advertisements for NFL Football and so i decided I would comeback on Sunday night to watch my Chargers play the patriots for SUNDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL.  Once I arrived Sunday Night, my friend and I ordered food and drink and noticed none of the TVs were on NBC, so around 5 minutes before game time I asked the waitress to change the channel to SUNDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL and she said \"no problem\". 15 minutes later (10 minutes into the game) the Tv still hadn't changed and the waitress returned. She said the manager had left and they weren't allowed to operate the remote! She then said \"the TVs are staying where they are...\". Note, I had already placed food order and this was a very big game. The food was so so. My friend and I had to scarf down our meal and go across the street where the game was on every TV. I do not blame the waitress but don't have giant NFL advertisements on every other tv and not show NFL Football unless you are wiling to hire people competent enough to operate a tv controller. I mean it's a sports bar right? Decent place to hang out.... Unless you are trying to watch football. Figure it out"}
{"text":"For lack of better words I was very disappointed. When we got there we had plenty of time to order a drink during happy hour but were told there would be a 10 to 15 minute wait till they could seat us. They basically held a line didn't allow anybody else to get in for happy hour even when there is open seating on the patio, not cool. When we finally did order food they messed up and placed an order for a taco not a torta, not sure how you confuse the two. And I ordered the spicy margarita which I've ordered it in the past in Scottsdale it was delicious and spicy the one I ordered in Tempe was bland no flavor and not even a hint of heat. I have been warned that the bartenders were not up to par but I  usually make my own judgement and this validated that. I'd like to go back and give it a second try but there was just so many negatives in the small amount of time we were there I don't know if its worth my time."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about El Hefe. I'm a huge fan of Dia de los Muertes so I'm instantly fan of their deccor and ambiance. It's 75% inside 25% patio with full exposure to the patio.  Now my first experience was somewhat awful. It was late on a Saturday night and the place was packed like sardines. If you thought you were going to take a step to the patio for some fresh air, think again. You'd be lucky if you made it out there or found room to stand. I think I learned that night, you just can't bring a big crowd to this location on a 'busy' Scottsdale evening.   Second experience was Happy Hour! I believe it's from 4-7 and they have a great happy hour menu for both men and women. I'm a bit partial to their Beer-goritas. , which is a 32 oz margarita and a coronita upside down in it! I love it, I think presentation sucked me in. Yea I'm a sucker.  The tables with the taps on them seem pretty sweet, and made me think about possibly holding my bday party there but the seating is limited and the booths just arent that big.   They have a lot of creative and unique margaritas to choose from and I definitely plan on making a few visits back but debateable on if this is a good birthday setting or not..."}
{"text":"I sat down with my wife to enjoy dinner and cocktails. At 9:15 while we're in the middle of eating and laughing some bar staff girl comes over and slaps a card on the table and says \"just so you know at 10:00 these tables are reserved and you'll need to be done. Are you fucking kidding me?? I'm drinking call drinks and Clase Azul and you're gonna make me feel like I'm being bounced after I've been here 45 mins??? 2 words.....fuck....off!!! And then the god damn bar manager comes over at 9:30 and says well you don't have to leave right away. Hey!! Eat shit you already walked me and threw a damper on an otherwise enjoyable night. Asshole........... This was my bad experience, now for the good. Since the original post I was contacted by the team at El Hefe regarding my concern. They took the post and my rant and used to educate the staff on a better approach to what could quickly become a sensitive issue. I went back last night to get a first hand look and from my first interaction at the front door with Sean through my service and reviewing the changes with the GM (Rob) my son and I had a great dining experience. I sincerely look forward to returning again in October with my wife for some more tasty tequila. They get 5 stars now for addressing a concern and improving upon it."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, loud, games on, DJ during commercials.... Cool spot. Food was good, nothing that knocked me off my stool, tacos were a couple bite sized and olny $3 i think. My brother had a brown bag of Tecate, classic! All good.... I would go back if in the hood of Snottsdale. Aloha"}
{"text":"Girls are crying for attention and the drinks get smaller for the same price, these people need to realize they are serving other people not celebrities lol no tips for you"}
{"text":"Food would've been good if it hadn't been cold. Waited 25 minutes for ten tacos, and the place was pretty slow. They cared more about talking to their coworkers than serving food. I guess we shouldn't have sat on the patio but it's a nice place to chill and people watch."}
{"text":"While here on a Friday night drinking with friends I became severely dehydrated and so stepped off to the edge of the game area to try to relax for a second, made the mistake of sitting down for a bit which the bouncer Andre didn't approve of as he was assuming I was too drunk. Told him that was fine so I stood up in the same area and was just hanging out, had a friend bring me a cup of water and he immediately kicked me out assuming I was having more to drink. As I tried to reason with him and asked him to merely take a whiff of the drink he became increasingly belligerent with me and wouldn't listen at all, in fact at one point he became physically aggressive with me when all I was trying to do was relax and make sure I wasn't sick. Thanks asshat, will not be coming back to this location with staff like that present who obviously care little about their patrons."}
{"text":"This place does have good food, only if your able to get what you ordered.. The Service and Managers are usually garbage to be honest. The only thing that's good there, are the security guards. I would rather go to sandbar or C.A.S.A, rather than to waste my time and money here at this place. Staff mostly tries way too hard just to look pretty, rather then to get the correct orders on food and Drinks. Been there multiple times, and they always mess up my order! I'm not a picky or complicated either, i order right off the menu. Plus, I work in the restaurant industry, so I'm usually very patient."}
{"text":"Wow!  Great tacos.  I had 4 different types and they were all fantastic!  Come on 2 dollar Tuesday and get fantastic,  cheap eats!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! The decor alone is so cool - kind of \"Dia de los muertos\" meets Compton, Cali! Love the metal bike and Virgen de Guadalupe at the door - nice touch! Margaritas are tasty and it's been wall-to-wall people every time I've been there. I will go back again. Oh and be sure to go back to the chalkboard - they have oodles of custom shots w/hilarious names. ;)"}
{"text":"Racist location. Went there on a game day. Had on usc gear and a pair of tennis shoes. Told me we cant get in because we were out of dress code because we had on tennis shoes. Ok no worries ill spend my money else where but you let white boys in with tennis shoes before us and about five packs after us. Save you money racism is alive. Look i didnt get 2 degrees to accept this kind of thing. Flip flops are ok but tennis shoes are not if you are black. If u have a dress code cool but if only for a certain look of person then thats racist."}
{"text":"The bouncers are bitches. Went on a Wednesday dead as hell... Told me I couldn't wear Jordan's in... But they let people with flip flops, Adidas and other brands in... Mike and I don't approve."}
{"text":"Edit: The manager came over and fixed the situation. Still wouldn't order a cocktail but cool that they refunded the second set of kettle.  Don't order a cocktail. Major ripoff. $9 for kettle and soda that was so weak that we ordered a second shot and it cost another $9. Basically you'll pay $18 for a very weak drink. Go across the street to HiFi..."}
{"text":"Not really my scene as this place aims to cram as much people as possible into this tiny space. So crowded that girls have to dance on the bar. It's a journey going to the bathroom. If hyperventilating was a place, it would be El Hefe"}
{"text":"The line does not move. They let whomever walks up to the VIP enterance in regardless. It's ridiculous. The music is great and drinks are a little pricey. If you wanna wait in line, not bad. I was told everyone that walks up is on the guest list... bullshit! The girl behind us in line tested it and went right in. The bathrooms are disgusting as well, doesn't matter what time of night."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit to El Hefe. The Margaritas were world class goooood! Our party of 8 was seated promptly and served extremely well. The $2 tacos were delicious regardless of the meat you choose. The atmosphere was outstanding with lively music all around. Our waitress was the best!! Keep up the good service and thank you for making us feel like \"The Boss\""}
{"text":"Stopped by for a margarita while in the Tempe area.  It happened to be Taco Tuesday so all tacos were $3 and house margaritas $6 so we had to try both. Got a fried avocado taco which was pretty good but could of used a little spice. The margarita was large but seemed watered down.  Good college area bar with good service and good Taco Tuesday prices. Also got our free \"check in\" Guac and chips which were tasty. Not bad but not outstanding either."}
{"text":"great happy hour prices. tacos are some of the best in Scottsdale. reminds me of the street vendors in cabo and rocky point.    great presentation on the trays. the tappers on the table are a nice touch.  younger crowd with attractive waitresses.  nice open air restaurant, close to the W hotel.  tacos and all the different salsas that come with the chips were fantastic."}
{"text":"The server was super attentive from the moment we walked in great food speedy service I have nothing bad to say about this plays the music was amazing definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"Place smells like cheap perfume or some odd scent for a restaurant. Our bartender was clueless and had zero confidence. Wont be back!"}
{"text":"It's a decent place. However the service is extremely rude. It's always dirty as well. I can't comment on the food because I haven't had it personally. If your a female buying drinks it seems like the bartenders tend to just look over you. Which was rude. Every time I have gone the bartenders walk straight past me, or look right at me and walk away while. I'm trying to order a drink. I always noticed. All of there bartenders. Have that stereotypical white skinny look. So there does not appear to be much diversity there. I wouldn't recommend this place to go at all. The only positive note I have to say is that the music is good 60% of the time."}
{"text":"Most crowded bar I've ever been to on a Sunday. My experience there left me feeling very overwhelmed.. We started with margaritas at the Hefe on Mill and then Uber'd our way on up to the one in Old Town Scottsdale.  I think if this bar was in a smaller city it would be more fun; just too many people for such a small spot. Or management might want to think about having a limit on how many people at one time.... It was ridiculous."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for dancing and having fun! Shots aren't too expensive and the jolly rancher is to die for"}
{"text":"Came on Taco Tuesday and was pleasantly pleased. Came in and the booths were closed so got a seat at the bar. Bartender was fast getting to us and friendly as well.   Got guac and chips for an app, came with a good amount of chips and guac was fresh and tasty. Would order again.   Ordered the $5/6 margaritas, pretty regular. Not bad, not amazing, but good nonetheless.   Lastly got the $2 tacos. Got mahi-mahi, carne asada, and chicken tinga. All veryyyy flavorful; I was surprised yet very happy. The tacos are decently sized with complimenting toppings/sauces. Definitely going again especially on taco Tuesday's.   The atmosphere is loud and almost club like, so probably not somewhere for a first date or someplace you go to talk about your life problems or story time. But great to go with friends or even solo to listen to a variety of music, possibly dance and grab some food and drinks after a long day."}
{"text":"Industrial meets Cantina decor. I think this would be a great date place if you come early. As the night went on, it got loud and crowded, although the music was great. Lots of 20s guys (for the ladies). Sugar skulls everywhere, flowery booths, etc. I think you have to come once. The food was \"eh\". Happy hour was $2 off, we tried some trendy tacos. That is not why people come. They come for the blasting music later, the large fast paced bar. Mainly guys, like I said. Ladies who are looking, may be a nice stop for you."}
{"text":"If you want to have a yummy drinks and food stop by anytime.  The bulldog beer-garitas are giant and delicious.  The pork tacos are my favorite but you can never go wrong with carne or chicken.  If you've never tried duck tacos, try them here.    If you want to party make sure you come by Friday night, Saturday night, or Sunday day. Make sure you put your party pants on cause you'll need em.  It gets wild and crazy.  WIth bottomless mimosa's on the weekends & great brunch specials you'll be glad you came.  It's always super crowded but the DJ keeps everyone moving.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Honestly if I could give this nasty bar ZERO stars I would. A group of us girls went out last night and stopped in here around 12:30. We grabbed drinks and started dancing. Some gross guy creeps up behind my friend and literally starts trying to bone her, she gives us the 'save me' face, so we pull her towards us. This guy apparently can't take rejection so he sucker punches my friend, A GIRL, in the face resulting in the black eye pictured below. He also elbows the girl he was trying to dance on in the nose causing an immediate bloody nose in the middle of the dance floor. So much commotion and not ONE bouncer is around, not one comes to see anything. Random people had to pull the guy away from trying to hit me as well. My poor friend runs to the bathroom with blood down her white shirt and running out of her nose and the bouncer there didn't even turn his head. I followed the creepy woman beater to the bathroom to try to stop him, but he practically shoves me to the ground and runs out. I told the security guards at the door and they literally did nothing until I started yelling that this bar let's woman beaters in and making a scene because literally NO ONE would help us out. Only then did they ask me for a description. Still didn't ask about my friend bleeding right in front of them. It's not like we're big tough girls either. My friend who got punched is tiny like 115 and I'm not much bigger. When this creep over 200lbs sucker punches a girl in the face, what should I do?!?!? What is the point of having security if you do nothing?!?! I called to try to speak with the manager multiple times today as my other friend may have a broken nose and they both would like to press charges if the asshole could be identified. I left my name and number because \"he was in a meeting, but he'll call you right back\" with no reply what so ever. OF COURSE. I should have called the cops last night, but at that point I just wanted to get my friends home since one of them still had blood gushing out of her nose. Although it wasn't this bars fault that that \"boy,\" we'll call him, is a complete piece of shit, but the way they handled the situation was sickening. This place is an absolute disgrace and clearly gives two shits about any kind rights for women. I'll never step foot in here again."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would! My husband and I attempted to go here for date night on 7/15/17, but were turned away at the door because of \"dress code.\" As my husband, who is African American, approached the door, the short White security guard continuously looked him up and down and around him. He asked for my husband's ID and continuously kept looking him up and down as to find a reason not to let him in. I then stepped to the side of him and the racist security guard said he couldn't come in because of his shoes. I searched high and low for said dress code that stated what shoes a person can and cannot wear in their establishment, however the only dress code that was found stated \"casual wear.\" I sent an email to express my concerns and still have yet to receive a response. Due to this individual and no explanation from him of what shoes are accepted, date night was ruined. I have told numerous people of my experience and have never felt more embarrassed or discriminated against."}
{"text":"If anyone tries to talk you into trying this place and youre hungry, I'd recommend avoiding. Drinks might be good, but the food was terrible. Two Hamburguesas we ordered were raw in the middle-Hard to tell because the meat was a weird reddish pink anyways, but this was no doubt raw. The meat was like a nasty meatloaf, spicy and not good in any way. Hope the drinks were strong enough to kill the bacteria in that vile stew of a \"hamburger\"."}
{"text":"I had the carne asada and the ground beef tacos....I'm not going to eat there ever again, the food was horrible and the service was even worse. You can get better tacos at Filibertos, no joke.They act very stingy with the chips too, they never asked if we wanted more or just brought more chips. Stay far away from this place, and spend your money where you will walk away happy. Somebody that knows how to run a good food place needs to buy that place and fix it because it's in a great location."}
{"text":"Will definitely be back! Came during a bar crawl so it was a bit hectic, but the staff still were on top of everything. The drinks were good. We ordered quesadilla and steak fries both good."}
{"text":"El Hefe - Macho Taqueria. Man...  At first glance it looks like every stereotype you've ever heard about Scottsdale. At second glance you realize that it is, indeed, every stereotype you've heard about Scottsdale. It's a \"Mexican Restaurant\", so when I was there I tried a few of their tacos that were on happy hour. I'm giving two stars because the duck taco that I had was pretty good, but once the food got to the table it took me 4 minutes to figure out which tacos were mine because of the way they present the food. More on this later.   El Hefe has a cool in-table tap system, where you pay at the table and can pour your own beer. When I saw this I liked it a lot, though they only offer two beers, and it's not cheap. After the \"cool\" factor wears off, you realize that you're paying extra to pour your own beer. Not so cool. The upside is the fact that I get beers for myself much faster than the servers at El Hefe did for me.   The booth seats are covered in plastic, in the style of your great grandmother. This is assuming, of course, that your great grandmother commissioned Ed Hardy to design her living room group. The ambiance isn't my style, but I'm sure that a lot of people love it...The biggest issue I had is the way the food is brought to the table. They start you with chips and salsa. It seems hard to screw up chips and salsa, but it happened here. The salsa comes in small jars that are downright weird, and they make dipping your chip absolutely impossible. You need to be a salsa MacGyver to figure out how to get the right amount of salsa on your chip...It's strange. After pushing some salsa around with a chip on a small plate for a while, our food arrived. Apparently, when you order tacos, they come 5-6 at a time, placed on wooden slabs that are roughly the size of a Las Vegas buffet. Our server couldn't remember who's tacos were who's, so we played a game of musical tacos (and wooden slabs) until we all figured out what we'd ordered. When a group of 4-5 orders 10+ tacos, you end up with 2-3 giant wooden slabs on your table and a very confusing family style presentation.   Like I said before, the duck taco I had was pretty good, and I hear good things about the BeerRita. However, unless I'm dragged against my will by a large group of people, I don't see myself returning to El Hefe anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went to this location for happy hour this past Thursday with a girlfriend. I ordered a margarita, said \"I'll have the happy hour house margarita ($6)\" and the waitress said okay. We get our bill and I was charged for a regular priced margarita ($13 - who would ever pay that for a margarita first of all). So I go over to the waitress and explain the situation. She then tells me \"oh we don't really do happy hour.\" I tell her that I've come for happy hour many times AND there is a happy hour menu on our table. Then she tells me that they're not doing HH during the final four. So I ask to speak to a manager. After waiting 10 min for this manager to come over, the waitress comes over and said there's no manager present. After questioning there being no acting manager on site, she changes her story and says he's in the \"back.\" After changing her story a few more times, she says he's in the bathroom and I'd have to wait to get the charge reversed. Clearly trying to make the wait so long that I'll just pay the full bill...nope. After another 10 minutes, he finally comes over and blames the waitress for not notifying us that they're not doing happy hour, but does not apologize.   Giving them two stars because the food was good and the manager ended up reducing the price of my margarita. But will never give this location my business again."}
{"text":"Met my husband there last night for dinner.  I arrived first around 6:40 and the place was basically empty.  Three people or so at the bar and two tables with two people.  I waited at my table for my husband to arrive for nearly 10 minutes.  No server came over.  Once my husband arrived the server walked by our table a few times before my husband asked if we had a waitress.  She took our order and while we waited for our food we watched the drunk people at the bar and one girl announcing that she was going to the bathroom to throw up.  When she returned, she and her \"date\" staggered out the door.  A new patron arrived and sat at the bar but left after 5 minutes with no service.  The other two tables cleared as well.  My Supermacho bowl arrived lukewarm with pinto beans instead of the black beans I ordered.  The sauteed fajita veggies were actually raw onion and diced peppers.  I would have asked for a manager but it did not appear that anyone in there cared.  We could not get out of there fast enough.  Unfortunately it took our server about 15 minutes to process our bill."}
{"text":"They were very understaffed for being a big event in Tempe. The food was worth it though the tacos are absolutely amazing! I had one of each and the fish one was by far the best! I ordered a non alcoholic bloody mary and was blown away as well! Make sure you check in so you get free chips and gauc!"}
{"text":"So I know that all of the 5 star reviews for this place are from people who have a hand in the company called Riot hospitality. They posted 5 stars on whiskey row, el hefe scottsdale, and public house on sixth (all riot properties) and used the almost the same exact post. Truth is, the bartenders stare at themselves all day and night while they fix their hair, and unless you're a friend of someone there, service is a \"c\" grade at best. Food is bland, drinks are inconsistent and the bartenders I've had, don't know how to make an old fashioned. I ordered a shot of rumplemintz and was given a shot glass full if simple syrup and that was the last time I went. This is the talent you'll find in the front of house at ALL of these properties."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. They don't even deserve one star. We tried to go last Saturday to have a few drinks with friends. We weren't allowed in because one of my friends was apparently wearing boots. Let me be clear that they were not boots. I noticed the guy standing behind us was wearing  boots but he was allowed in and when I mentioned it to the bouncer his response was, \"yeah, he's wearing cowboy boots\". He didn't let us in because my friend was wearing 'boots'. Some boots are allowed and some are not? The other bouncer standing next to him told him to let us in because my friend was not wearing so called boots and he still didn't want to. Never going there again. The guy just wanted to be a douche. I really hope this was not race related."}
{"text":"At least the food is of good quality. The service is deplorable for lunch. My server ignored me repeatedly as I attempted to get her attention in order to get something to drink.  The place was not full either and there was sufficient staff to tend to the restaurant which was at perhaps slightly less than a third of capacity. My experience there has been significantly better at dinner time. The variety in the menu won't disappoint, just don't get your hopes up for anything resembling good service. I'm a generous tipper (over 30%) and this place sadly did not cut the mark to earn even 15% tip for lunch."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food, hot, fresh, and delicious. Noisy lively atmosphere, lots of good people watching."}
{"text":"1st Clue: All the restaurants/bars were pretty packed except here. Waitress was \"ok\" until you told her that some of our food REALLY sucked, then she didn't bat an eyelash. If 3/4 of your party says the food sucked, then it sucks!!! Hey tried it, now I know. The town street is happening here awesome weekday/night life but just not here!"}
{"text":"Had the avacoda tacos, and they were great. The salsa was great also. On Tuesday the tacos are $3.00. Great price"}
{"text":"Today I watched as two of El  Hefe's staff members explicitly denied service to a black man for wearing basketball shoes. Their justification was that those shoes are used to \"fight\". Terribly disappointed by their inherently racially charged and biased policy as they allowed almost every other person with athletic style shoes through and refused to allow service to my friend. We tried talking to the staff and they simply dismissed our concerns. I urge you to reconsider your approach and training of your staff members in regard to safety precautions and respect for diversity and equity in our community."}
{"text":"Oh Hefe, my home away from home...I made a recent discovery of the amazuzing tacos here the other day and I'm kicking myself for not trying them sooner with as much as I'm here!  If you don't do anything else here, TRY THE TACOS!!!!  I had the Carne Asada and the Pork tacos and they were freaking delicious!  My friend ordered the chips and salsa which I know isn't really anything super special but the pico de gallo was very good as well, just in case you were wondering.  If you're going to come on a weekend night it does get pretty crowded so I wouldn't recommend coming if you're claustrophobic but it's a fun atmosphere where you can meet a lot of interesting people and get some good drinks and tacos!"}
{"text":"I would have to agree with Lauren F., that this place garners some seriously unnecessary hatred! I had a blast here, the service was friendly, and dammit, IT DOES SMELL SO GOOD IN THERE! Someone please let me in on the secret!   Sure there were a few groups partying pretty hard for Sunday Funday, but hey, to each their own... didn't bother me one bit! Also, I can't imagine what else would be on the telly, in place of the \"obnoxious\" sports that someone previously complained of! What would you rather be watching kind sir? Or was it ma'am....   All in all, it's an incredibly attractive space, and Tempe should consider itself lucky to have such a well thought out concept. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The prices on the bill were not the same as the prices on the menu, which did not contain the specials that the their website said they had ($3 mimosas and Mule specials). The service was friendly however multiple items we did not order appeared on the bill at first, when I asked that it be corrected some were taken off (but not all, the remaining once were small things and our bill was around $100 so I did not bother), then noticed that multiple of the prices were different on the menu then on our bill (mostly by a dollar or 2 off, but it was on a couple different items.) Waitress was confused but didn't bother to get a manager to clear things up, we just paid and left because the 6 dollar difference (Originally 18) was not worth the struggle and we don't go out in Old Town that often.  The food was decent, some in my party thought the breakfast burrito was rather small, another person was told they no longer carried the item on the menu  they wanted to order from it. I normally tip well over the 20% gratuity when I go to a place to watch a football game, in this case since the bill was wrong I just paid the gratuity and did not leave the extra I would have left after being at a table for over 3 hours. Disappointing that they did not have their advertised specials and that the bill prices and menu prices did not add up. The huge LCD screens are cool but they need to get their act together"}
{"text":"I'm reviewing the late night club/party scene (didn't try any food yet). Came here with friends after the ASU football game and after already getting our drink on at Cue. The line is definitely long for most parts of the night but it's still worth it. DJ plays the best hits and the dancing was off the chain. My only gripe is that they close at 2 while Moonshine's open another hour. Stay open to compete for business and keep the party going!  The only people I don't recommend this place to are those that are easily claustrophobic."}
{"text":"Crappy crappy drinks. What you read and order is not what you get! If you have to verify what they put in the drinks vs. what is ordered - bad service."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Food was good, not the best and the prices are too high for what you get. Customer Service is terrible. I have seen my waitress 2 times, no refills on my drinks or salsa, my order was messed up. And I could understand if the place was busy, but its not. I expected more. I Left disappointed. Hopefully someone has a better experience then I did."}
{"text":"Was referred to this bar because it hosts UofA watch parties for football games. Place was pretty busy because of Halloween weekend. Layout is nice/unique, but it was pretty cold inside.  Television set up was adequate: a UFC fight was on the same night so they split the tv's between the fight and the game. They don't have televisions set up everywhere like a sports bar (if that matters to you), but it got the job done.  Me and my buddy ordered some nachos with steak (I'd recommend splitting if you order it) and it was pretty good. Then tried the carne asada and duck tacos: i'd give the slight edge in flavor to the duck taco. All the tacos are pretty small FYI.  Service was also OK, waitress was pretty nice. I'd probably go here again."}
{"text":"They don't let people in who have neck or face tattoos This is DISCRIMINATION WHICH IS ILLEGAL This is not a dress code enforceable issue Same as not allowing someone in because of their sexual preference Hope someone sues the pants off them"}
{"text":"We went there on a Saturday night. Waited 30 minutes in line. The bouncer check my id than says my boyfriend can't get in because of his neck tattoo. There was no dress code posted and there was also others in the bar with neck tattoos and fully covered. It's not Scottsdale it's a college area. Upon looking around I know it wasn't just the neck tattoos it was they he looked which is bullshit. I am never going there again."}
{"text":"Tonight I had the pleasure of interacting with one of El Hefe's \"special\" bartenders. He happily took my credit card for my $12 drink. Soon afterwards I was approached by the same bartender with a different card. The bartender insisted that I had gave him a Bank of America card. I've literally never been in a Bank of America in my life. I told the bartender that it was not my card. He looked at me and told me it was my card.  We went back and forth. I told the bartender, who must of been held back in elementary school reading comprehension, that no, I had not given him a red BoA card. Instead I originally gave him a dark grey Wells Fargo credit card. He looked at me and said no, he received two cards in the past few minutes and of the two this Bank of America card was mine. I told him no, I gave him a Wells Fargo card and he would look at me an accuse me of lying to him. He was so confident in himself that he wouldn't even listen to me. What a joke, I could find a better employee at the homeless shelter.  It became such a situation that everyone around me at the bar was literally pulling in my favor. The bartender would say, \"no this is your card\". And I, along with half the bar would laugh in his face and deny the absurd claim. Finally this bartender realized his mistake. I don't know if it was divine intervention or an actual self reflection but either way I received my credit card back which was a huge relief.  However the story doesn't end there.  I checked my Wells Fargo account soon after this incident. I saw the $12 drink charge, which was expected. However I also saw a $16 charge right next to it! Wow, this incompetent bartender managed to lose my card, find it, then charge it for some fraudulent amount.   I called Wells Fargo already and they have started their investigation into the matter. I am leaving you this review to consider your decisions before you visit El Hefe Tempe. The next time I visit this bar I will be sure to bring cash and I recommend you do the same.  Edit: I called El Hefe this morning and spoke with Jamie, one of the managers. He looked into it and confirmed that the bartender had charged me for two drinks. He was very understanding and is going to have the GM reverse the charge later today. Because Jamie was very cool about it I am raising my review to 2 stars."}
{"text":"Had Margaritas here with my boyfriend here and it was pretty OK. We only had chips and salsa, no food. Pretty good."}
{"text":"This place is okay. Good drinks. Love the strawberry margarita. But the location is too small compared to the Mill location. Also, don't bring a guy here if you're on a date, all he will look at are the whistle girl's butts."}
{"text":"Went for the st. Patrick's day event and it was the best experience my group of friends and I had.  We all had so much fun!!!!!  There were games to play,  everyone around us was really nice. My main thing about bars are the staff.  The staff here are some of the best I've seen on mill Ave.  Nice,  attentive,  good attitudes.   Love it,  definitely going back with more friends"}
{"text":"Great service, food, drinks and atmosphere! Brandi and Zach were awesome. Devin, the security guy was very polite and accommodating. The GM Rob Mier made sure everything was awesome. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"The bouncers and especially are rude with a power trip and can suck a DICK. They wouldn't allow my friend and i in the bar because we were wearing shorts on while other customers were wearing shorts. Such Liars! That place is overrated. Big douche bar! BITCH IT AINT VEGAS! !"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, for some reason a lot of my friends enjoy having their birthdays here.  I do not like waiting in line and there is ALWAYS a line here.  I should stress my main experience here is only on a Friday or Saturday night.  Its always packed in here, and hot as can be.  Hard to move let alone dance.  Often tough to get to the bar and order a drink because there are so many people posted up there.  Not my favorite place, there are generally fun good looking people but at the price of standing like cattle.  Drinks are decent and well priced, but I only go here if I have to.  Just far too crowded for me, too hard to order drinks, hard to dance.  No where to sit down really at night.  I believe there is good seating in the day, but they move all the tables and chairs to make space for more people."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of downtown Tempe, let's call this the Mexican version of The Tilted Kilt. Attractive young women in really short shorts serve you with a smile. The menu was limited, the food was good. Many big screen TV's around the bar to watch sporting events."}
{"text":"If you like the smell of pot, or smoke yourself, then definitely hang out here. Otherwise inconsiderate people, including employees, will be smoking weed in the middle of the establishment. I honestly don't care what people smoke, but at least follow smoking laws of doing it at least 25 feet away from the front door and not in the middle of the bar."}
{"text":"They have great tacos and nachos. I haven't tried much of their other menu. If I could change 1 thing, it would be their service. I went in about a week ago and my group was completely ignored so we had to leave. I understand because they were extremely under staffed and the spring training crowd was in. Overall, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"El Hefe is one of my favorite Bars/Restaurants to enjoy dinner and drinks with friends. I typically visit during the weekdays for Taco Tuesday or the other specials, and weekend nights for partying. I'm never disappointed with this spot.  As a Restaurant - I'm a huge fan of the tacos on the menu (Chicken Tinga and Fried Avocado are my favorite), but the other items are delicious, too. They also have great drink specials - the Bulldogarita is my go-to (a huge margarita with a beer in it).  As a Bar/Nightclub - I'm also a hug fan. I love coming here with my friends. There are awesome DJs every night, the staff members wear fun theme costumes, and everyone is always so amped up having a good time. El Hefe has become a regular spot for me and my friends and I couldn't imagine a replacement in my social routine!"}
{"text":"Very sad excuse for Mexican Food... food is terrible... and by the way, you spelled \"jefe\" wrong... the way it is spelled (hefe) would be pronounced \"eh-feh\"... which means F. So in conclusion, The F has terrible mexican food..."}
{"text":"Nice place with a great staff. We went on a Thursday night which was a light night and were served by Cameron, a very cool and friendly bartender. Highly recommend the Mamacita margarita and churro Sunday."}
{"text":"Amazing food--try the Mahi Mahi and Pork Al Pastor tacos. Service is fantastic. Come before it gets super busy and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed from this bar/restaurant we went there last night and after standing in line for about a hour the bouncer told us that my buddy couldn't get in because of the shoes he was wearing? Wtf is that about  he was wearing regular Nikes its my guess that it wasn't actually his shoes but his nationality i didn't know that in this era that restaurants still discriminated but i guess there's still a select few that do this being one of them all i can say is there's plenty of bars around mill Ave don't waist your time at this one."}
{"text":"So many places like this in the area... Everyone is trashed with all the cheap liquor served.  Police is always hanging out side probably for a good reason.  Young crowd if that's your thing, pretty unique table set up with your own tap :)"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesdays for lunch are where it's at! $2 tacos and they're all delicious. They give the option of choosing between like 8-10 different tacos from shrimp, carne asada and duck carnitas to beef cheek. All really tasty on the fresh corn tortillas."}
{"text":"This review is strictly on the food. They have some of my favorite Gourmet tacos I've ever had. My favorite is the shrimp taco but it is now off the menu which I hope they someday bring it back! They have vegetarian options which is awesome. Everytime I eat there I always pair my tacos with one of their huge margaritas. I recommend going on Tuesdays to take advantage of there all day Taco Tuesday menu."}
{"text":"Randomly went in here with my dad for a quick bite to eat. The girl who served us was great. Great personality and made sure we were happy. Margaritas were tasty. Even the other staff took great care. Wish I could mention names Tacos were delicious. Five star experience all in all. Glad we popped in. Completely unexpected and delighted."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. They gave my guacamole to the people next to me. It took them over 20 minutes to bring the next batch out to me as I watched others get more. Food was excellent though. Tacos are amazing."}
{"text":"I'm gonna be completely honest here. Me and my brother went in last night to have a good time. We ordered one beer and a rum and coke. It costed $12.25, seeing that it's a nightclub that's pretty reasonable so I didn't care. When the scantily clad bar tender came back I ordered my second rum and coke, no beer this time, the check came back as $12.25... why?? I was definitely not drunk enough for the bartender to try and play that trick on me. At this point it was like 10pm and the bar started poppin so I wasn't too mad. Then some Mexican bro started grabbing up on me thinking I was the girl he was hitting on, problem is I'm a dude and he was grabbing my stomach. Once I got his hand off my abbs and moved to a different location, found some girls, and had a kick ass time. So all together if you wanna have your wallet drained for a 90% coke 10% rum drink then go right ahead. But avoid the drunk weirdos and find yourself some babes"}
{"text":"While visiting in town a group of about 6 of us stopped here for some dinner on a Saturday night. We were able to easily be seated right away and I loved that they had multiple TVs playing the playoff games.   I'm not sure why there's such harsh reviews of this place, I thought the food was great. To start we had some complementary chips and salsa along with a free chips and guacamole for checking in on Yelp. The guacamole was great, super tasty. The only complaint here would be the chip to dip ratio. For an entree I had the three tacos with black beans. I opted for the mahi mahi, pork al pastor & carne asada. I loved the mahi mahi & carne asada, but wasn't too keen on the al pastor. It was just too sweet for my liking.  Overall I thought this place was pretty good. Tasty fun, high energy, good music and a great location. I'm not sure what's not to like? I'd definitely come back here again and try some more of the tacos."}
{"text":"After a crappy visit here the manager contacted me to invite me back and send me a gift card. I am still looking for my gift card 3 months later. I tried to email the manager with no response what a shitty establishment!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to the restaurant.  My wife and I both ordered the 3 taco combo and one side dish.  My wife got rice for her side and I had the Mexican fries.  The tacos were very good and my wife fully agreed.  She liked her rice and I thought the fries were very good.  We left and I told her I would come back to eat here again for sure.  Then about 30 minutes later, we were both so exhausted we thought we were either drugged or they are using MSG in the food.  We are both sensitive to MSG and only feel like this after eating Chinese food lased with it.  I did not call the restaurant to verify weather or not they use MSG but can think of no other reason we both felt the exact same symptoms. I would highly recommend the tacos but for anyone who does not want MSG in their food, at least ask before ordering.  Just to be clear, I DID NOT verify if they do or do not use MSG."}
{"text":"I was having a awesome night tonight but out of nowhere this Asian dude work there just ask me to leave just because I was having fun. Is it because I am Asian American? Is this a place do not like Asian American to have fun? I don't know. But I will never wanna step in this place ever again in my life."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Stopped by while hopping around Old Town. The music was on point and most of the dancers were great. The crowd was mid-twenties but weren't really dressed up. People were spread out on the outdoor patio are and the inside. It was fun stopping by and was one of the better spots we stopped by in Old Town."}
{"text":"The new menu is awesome.  I had the steak bowl with a fried egg in it and fresh avocado.  It was way better than the bowl at Diego Pops.  I highly recommend this place.  Awesome service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Second time coming to this place in 2years. Not impressed with the service of the bartender. When we walked in, the place was totally dead with only 2 people sitting at the bar. We sat at the bar and waited to get service. The bartender was more interested in texting on her freakin phone instead of helping us. She saw when we sat down and continued texting, then she started chatting  to her other co-workers, then went to the other side of the bar to help other customers. She finally came over after I stared her down and had a personality of a rock!!! I'm very disappointed in the service we received and will not be returning back. It's shocking how establishments let their employees ignore their customers,yet let them text. Bad service = no TIP"}
{"text":"I've been coming to El Hefe Tempe since I was a young biomedical engineering & business major at ASU. Since I turned 21 this has been my go to spot for a mean Taco & Margarita. Thomas & Sean Frantz always take care of me when I'm feelin' like poppin' some Dom Perignon to celebrate with the team. Big shout out to Haley Lanford, Dede Machowski, Thomas, Alexis V & Tatianna & Courtney Leaming (sad to see you not here all the time miss chu). If you see any of these staff members working, you know your in for a fun time, amazing drinks and impeccable service. If your ever out on Tuesday or Thursday on Mill Ave or raging for a Sun Devil win, I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE you to come by and show the staff some love! SHOUT OUT to Ryan & the Riot Hospitality Group for creating an everlasting concept that is here to stay. I'm old enough to remember Canteen & let's just say I don't miss it at all even though they hosted me for my 21st! I'll be back every week as long as I'm living in Tempe AZ!  #RHG"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience here, whether I'm watching the game with the boys or celebrating a night out with Scottsdale Nights on BOSS TUESDAYS, El Hefe Scottsdale is your go to for TACO TUESDAY"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars.. I would. I have never seen service the way I saw here! The WORST customer service from the moment we walked in to wait for a table. Not only was the entire patio open, but we had a wait... but they messed up our entire order for three different plates.  When we let one of the guys know, not our server.. he snapped and said \"just keep that one\" what did u want... sounding and looking very rude and annoyed.. uhm, I'm sorry sir... we didn't plate it and send it out.. get an expedited back there so you don't have his problem. When we let our server know she said \"oh the kitchen has its days.. and they have been messing it up\" uhm, we don't care for your unorganized kitchen.  Bless our servers heart, she was the only one in that entire place who cracked a smile..  any who... who ever owns this place needs to check it out on Sunday nights. We didn't get plates. Utensils, nothing. When we asked that same guy who snapped for utensils.. he, again, with an attitude said \"ya. They are finishing rolling them in the back, we have been busy\" we get it.. just say... \" sorry about that, I'll bring some out in a moment\" mind you our food was already on the table after 45 min.. we asked for a box to the same guy, and he never returned with one. I can go on and on.. but for this place, I'll stop.   Thanks, but no thanks."}
{"text":"As a restaurant this place has fabulous food but hit or miss service. We went twice the first time was great. Our bartender actually order our tacos and made us delicious strawberry margaritas served in goblets. The second time the male bartender totally ignored us, forgot to put our food order in, and was serving dudes before us. This place is also very particular on who they let in. I have seen the bouncer not let a few people in. Otherwise a pretty decent polar overall."}
{"text":"So I just want to say the manager Mark and our server Andria were absutley amazing. I ordered food and it came with something I don't like it. When I told her she asked her manager and when he came over he apologized and said he would get me more tacos. Highly recommended to come to El Hefe.   Ps. Come buy lots of bottles from Andria."}
{"text":"I'm giving one star because after I spend my entire night spending hundreds on drinks, on my way out trying to get through the very condensed crowd the security and bartender girl were also trying to get through for their obnoxious \"bottle service\" delivery. They were having no luck getting through, and neither was I. This was the clubs fault for letting too many people in. But instead of waiting or gentle nudging through the security guard shoved my friends and I, spilling all of our paid beverages all over us. My drink also spilt on them, which gave the trashy bartender the idea to reach down and PULL MY HAIR. I was then dragged out by security being yelled at for throwing drinks. I was completely appalled. I live in Las Vegas and deal with lots of bullshit at bars and clubs but never have been physically attacked by employees, especially when I was trying to leave the bar. This place does not have their shit together and the employees are violent and do not give a single shit about their paying customers."}
{"text":"Really sub-par electronic music. Great for scoring 'roids. Perfect if you like vodka/redbull and hitting your girlfriend."}
{"text":"The Boss? Seriously? This place is a mess. Went there today and it wasn't overly busy. Short line out front.  We waited 1/2 for a table. They text us, we showed up and got a table. Then the fun began. Hostess came over to tell us to get back in line.  Said we jump past people and took the table. We explained the reservation and she said oh okay, I didn't know. She then took our order of drinks and appetizers and left. 20 minutes later a waitress comes over and wants to take our order. We explain once again. Wait another 10 minutes, and nothing. Total of 30 minutes of my life I will never get back. All 3 of us got up and left. Walked over to Z Tejas where it's always good. Won't be back. Ever!"}
{"text":"Bring back Canteen. If there were zero stars, that's what the would get. I came in at 5pm to watch a playoff hockey game and asked if they could put it on. The bartender was sweet she said she would \"ask her to put it on\" which I will assume means she needed to ask the manager. 10 minutes later they changed the TV to the wrong game, so we asked them to change it. At 5:30 it still wasn't on so we left and went to Pedalhaus.. which has cheaper and better Margaritas anyways #bringbackcanteen"}
{"text":"I have no idea how they make absolutely everything taste so good! I could lick the nacho skillet every time! The atmosphere is outdoor party vibe - great mix of indoor and outdoor seats. The Bloody Mary was spectacular. This place is a Tempe fave!"}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite downtown tempe spots to go to , as they have great music and atmosphere. Unfortunately we ran into an uncomfortable situation that made me not want to go back. I'm with a party of 3 and I'm the first one in bouncer checks my ID and I'm good to go but my boyfriend is up next and he's dressed appropriately the bouncer checks his id but then checks his shoes and doesn't allow him in.  Mind you there are no signs that say there is a dress code in place. Next up was our friend with shorts and work shoes and he was allowed in . This was disappointing to see as we were excited to enjoy the venue. We would truly advise to post dress code for any and all confusion and disappointment  for your current and future clientel."}
{"text":"The experience I had here was absolutely horrific! We went to this bar because it was on the list for our 90's bar crawl we were attending. I have been to this bar in the past and it was always super packed so this time I was excited since the traffic was slower. Upon arriving we attempted to get drinks at the bar. I've been to bars in the past to know that there is always going to be a bit of a wait when ordering drinks but something was off about the wait time we experienced. A person from our group tried to get the bartenders attention, he made eye contact with him and the bartender went straight to the person to our right to get their order. We figured maybe he just didn't see us so we kept waiting and listening to music. As soon as he was finished he walked the end of the bar and as he was on his way back to our side, he made eye contact with us again but went to the group that was to our left that just had walked up and began to took their order. Now I know he was choosing to ignore us because we had yellow helmets on and bowls attached to our heads with green slime (for our 90's costume) so it would be pretty difficult not to see us in a crowd let alone a bar. We had been waiting so long and were so shocked that we were being ignored that we ended up asking that same group to order our drinks for us. When he came back with the bill and grabbed it and thanked him for finally making our drinks. The more we stood there the more I paid attention to the fact that it wasn't just that we were apart of the 90's crawl but perhaps a race issue as I noticed that a group of really pretty Hispanic girls near by trying to order drinks were receiving the same type of service as we were. It was so bad that another person not soon after asked if we wanted them to order our drinks so we could get service quicker.The bartenders name was Mike B. and the way he treated us and I can only imagine others is unacceptable and needs to be dealt with."}
{"text":"First off, if I could give this place ZERO stars I would.  Let me break it down as to why.  First, I used to love this place... quick bike ride from home, allows dogs, has the grass in the back... TVs on the patio etc.  BUT, one of the times I recently went, I had a few margaritas, tacos and a couple beers and since I sat on the patio, I had to open a tab; the tab was closed at $55.  BUT before I could close my tab, they LOST my damn credit card, took them 20 minutes to find it.  Lone behold, a couple weeks later, I check my account, and I had TWO transactions, one for the $55 that I authorized and another for $225.25 that I had nothing to do with (keep in mind this was a random weekday).  First off, if I were to spend $280 at a bar, it wouldn't be at a bar on mill... that is for damn sure and it would be on a damn weekday.  When I called to speak with a manager (Brittany), she said she would investigate and then refund my money.  However, as a couple days passed, I didn't hear from her and had to call back, TWICE.  Once I finally got a hold of her, she said she spoke with the GM, ROB, and Rob said that they were unable to refund my money and I would have to dispute it.  I saw the original receipts, the signatures don't match and the bills are from separate tables. So either one of the servers diliberately committed fraud and charged my card for someone else's tab or it was an accident.  Either way, I should have to jump through hoops to get my money back.  I used to go to this place a couple times a week, not anymore!  F El Hefe... F Riot... Boycotting all RIOT owned properties from now on.  You would have easily made way more money than $225 off of me for the next few years, especially how much I go.  But now, not only will you lose all business from me and my friends, but I hope others do as well.  Do not go to this place, they don't care about their customers nor providing a great service, they only care about $$$... to the point here they have to steal it from their customers."}
{"text":"If i could give this place negative stars i would. My first time and completely unprofessional bartenders.  Ordered a glass of bubbly that was listed on their menu. After 10 minutes (after everyone else in my party had rheir drinks and were half way done, she brought out my glass of champagne. The wrong one. So i pointed it out to her and asked again for the glass i ordered.  So she takes my glass obstensibly to get the glass i ordered.  Another few minutes later she comes back to say they don't have what i ordered. So i ask for my original drink back. Of course rather than just leaving it, she poured it down the drain. Total waste. Never once was there an apology or acknowledgement for her mistake.  Sorry but after bartending and waiting tables for years,whatever happened to making the customer happy. I will never ever give this business my money."}
{"text":"This place continues to deliver. We had such an awesome time last night. We celebrated a few different special occasions, we had a great time. Meghan made our night, this girl has great energy and has the biggest smile. Everyone in our group all agreed that Meghan was the standout employee of the night. Not only all her interactions with us, but also the way she treated everyone around her."}
{"text":"I typically don't write reviews but I went out to El Hefe May 25th for my birthday, I reserved a table with 2 bottles two weeks prior along with my friends. We got there around 11pm and spent almost $1,000.00 only to be asked to come down from our table around 12:30am because it had been resold after we finished our bottles. Long story short, do not buy bottle service from this place. Specially from Xavier who's the one that resold our table."}
{"text":"I went for taco Tuesday. I was expecting an extremely packed restaurant, but it was the opposite. Yall have great prices for happy hour and taco tuesday. However, I was extremely disappointed in the staff. We were told we would have to wait 15-20 minutes and there were tons of open seats. People would come in that were friends with the hostess and be immediately seated. Therefore, we sat at the bar. However, since we didn't order alcohol the bartender ignored us.  The food was decent. It was my second time going here and probably won't go back."}
{"text":"This place...just wasn't for me.    The company I work for took us on a mini-retreat to Scottsdale for a weekend, and a crew of us made our way over to El Hefe.  And...it was just....how do I put this nicely?  Just not the Midwest.  All the women with fake tans, fake boobs spilling out of tanks, faux sexy hipsters mixed Men wearing tight Ed Hardy's with overly gelled hair & possible steriod use?  Just not my thing.  And it wasn't just the crowd of people there.  I ordered two gin & tonics (same gin) and they tasted VASTLY different.  On top of that, there were the overly surly cocktailers who seemed to be pissed off that people were there drinking.    I mean, I get that you want to finish your side-work and get home, but when a bar is open (and it's not even midnight), you can't get pissed off at your customers for putting down a drink on a table in an open section.  My favorite part of the night?  Leaving.  Sorry Boss."}
{"text":"Service is lousy, food is good though.  BEWARE this place charges a 3% \"tech processing fee\" for credit cards.  Just reduce the tip by this amount and the management will catch a clue."}
{"text":"We had a group of 13 of us today for a birthday/football get together .. Let me tell you that this place SUCKS  We never even made it thru the door and this goon of a door man was looking at us  Geez dude it's Sunday football and it's Scottsdale We were dressed appropriately . Bottom line is This place SUCKS way better places in Scottsdale Then this doucher don't waste your money here"}
{"text":"Came last night to watch the ufc fight. The bar overall was great and a fun experience. Got there early and sat at the bar but got so crowded real quick. The bartender was great. Drinks were good. Got the carne asada fries and it was really good. We had fun. Will definitely come again when we're in town."}
{"text":"Excellent TVs at the bar. Great sound system.   Bar Service is hit and miss. Free chips and guac with yelp check in is great! Comes with 2 salsas and pico. Tacos were good too.  This is a Chicago sports bar - Blackhawks, Bears, Bulls. Not sure on Cubs or White Sox."}
{"text":"Just came into town to visit my girlfriend. First time here. The music attracted me here as walking by from across the street. The staff was all pretty mild, then our server, Ashley Akbar, which upfront said she was new to serving. I have never been more pleased or impressed by a server that went over and beyond to give us the best service. She is an asset to this place and I will be back for sure and will always request her section.  Thanks Ashley Akbar!! You are the best!"}
{"text":"I will start off by saying that this review is influenced by two completely different experiences, which is represented by my middle of the road rating. (First visit: 4 star, Recent visit: 1 star)  To keep this relatively short I will just bullet point the things these two visits have taught me.   1. El Hefe is NOT a place to take a group. All the food ordered by a single table comes out together on the same blocks (yes I mean wooden blocks), with no sense of order. Now granted going with a group of 15 people (which I did), tends to lead to some confusion at any restaurant, but this was inexcusable. If you ordered the same thing as someone on the opposite side of the table from you it would come on the same platter and it was up to the customer to yell across the table, find what they had ordered, and have it passed over to them. This becomes particularly difficult with unfamiliar specialty tacos. Everything looks similar so only order something with a noticeable ingredient to guarantee correct delivery.   2. Having said that, this place does well with small groups, during the lunch time hours. Sit in one of the booths with the self serve beer taps at the table. It's definitely a unique and cool feature.   3. Check your bill! Every person in our group was overcharged for a particular drink that we specifically asked about the price. The same thing occurred with an up charge on a food menu item add on.   4. The décor is cool and unique, but be prepared for an Ed Hardy-esque explosion. Just embrace it.   5. The food is pretty delicious, but I am not a connoisseur.  Be prepared for small taco portions and tapas style entrees.   Overall this is a place for a quick happy hour drink and delicious $3 taco or a nice light lunch.  It's growing pains are providing a temporary excuse for some of it's short comings so be patient but provide feedback. It's needed.   P.S Don't forget to try the Bulldog Margarita (Margarita with a Corona in it)"}
{"text":"Fabulous food, drinks, delicious. Waitress didnt know what a mojito had in it..  But, overall, good experience"}
{"text":"I have never been to El Hefe at night, only for lunch or early happy hours so my review is for the food an ambiance during the daytime. I come here often for lunch, they have great street tacos, salsas and quesadillas. The happy hour is spot on with both food and drink specials from 3-7pm. Taco Tuesdays have $2 tacos and the patio is awesome when the weather is nice.   While I can't speak to the night time atmosphere this is a great spot to grab lunch or happy hour on Mill."}
{"text":"Disappointed with this visit. I had dinner here one year ago and it was truly amazing so much so that I went out of my way to eat at the one in Chicago and then came back this trip to Scottsdale and brought some friends. I had been telling them for weeks the margaritas were one of the best I had ever had and they had to try one. Unfortunately, timing did not work out for us to eat but we decided to grab some of those delicious margarita that I had been thinking about for a year. To my dismay the bartender was in a rush and did not measure very accurately making them too tart to the point that they were almost undrinkable.  We decided we would just finish our drinks and then head to another establishment in the area. Prior to leaving I stopped by the restroom which was in deplorable condition! Two of the three toilets were not functioning, stall doors did not lock and the overall cleanliness was disgusting. The unsanitary conditions solidified the poor experience for this visit. I don't think this location will be on the \"must visit\" list next spring."}
{"text":"Great food (tacos to die for) , lovely staff, and awesome Dj's. Good place for Sunday Funday and one of the best bars on Mill Ave if you're into the lively bar/club scene."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for brunch! It's flipping far from my house but it is so worth it. Brunch is full blown during football season. They have street tacos and street corn. Every time we go we order so much stuff.   1.Queso Dip with the amazing little tortillas and chips 2. Bottomless Mimosas (which have gotten kind of expensive). You still have to pay like a penny after the first one just a FYI 3. Carne Asada street tacos, fish tacos, and pork tacos (not for me). And last but not least the best ever  The Churro French Toast with Prickly Pear Cactus syrup.  Honestly we probably only drive 45 minutes for the French toast because brunch can be cheaper so many other places but it's THAT good. Make sure you call before you go to verify they're having brunch otherwise you might be heavily disappointed.   Also on my birthday they always give me a few shots. Super cool."}
{"text":"Tried to get dinner here. Stood at the host stand for 5 minutes to try to get a table. Finally the bartender noticed I was waiting and told me to sit anywhere and she'd send someone over. Waited on the patio for 15 minutes without anyone looking my way. I was never even greeted. I certainly won't be back. As I left to go get food elsewhere, 7 people were lined up outside an empty restaurant to try to get a seat. Absolutely horrible experience."}
{"text":"I had the best time at El Hefe, it seemed like they were giving out shots of Tequila everytime something was going on during sports game and they were so many fun random people to talk to. Be careful though, lots of young guys hit on you whether you are cougaring it up or not. It was packed and tons of fun, we were lucky all of us got to sit/grab a couch table outside and that was real fun and we could see all kinds of crazy stuff going on viewing the hilarious people sitting at the bar...There's a lot of funny customers here."}
{"text":"This restaurant was so accommodating and had quick service! Our waitress Amy was drop dead gorgeous and kind! Love our experience!"}
{"text":"First off I want to start by saying how great the bar staff and security were once my friends and I arrived... the atmosphere is a vibrant and hip one and they play a great selection of music. The only downfall I had was with the bottle service girl we had. She was a little disrespectful towards the end of our evening and it ruined the whole experience for us. Not sure if we will return but thanks again to the security for accommodating us"}
{"text":"Worst bartenders ever. The girls there are stuck up and rude. When all we were trying to do was get decent service on a friends 21st birthday they disregarded us. Waited 15 minutes to get the attention of the ditzy female bartender who then rolled her eyes at us when we asked the price of a drink calling us \"bargain hunters\". Sorry for asking, won't be going here or recommending this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Out of control.  There is no other way to describe it.  If you're in a serious mood to dance, party, fist pump, and make questionable decisions then this is the place to be!  Especially on Sundays!  All of my experience here has been during Spring Training so I guess it was a little more out of control than usual, but I'd like to experience this place when it is less of a sh*t show."}
{"text":"Meh.  I was eager to check out this venue simply because my friends used to tell me amazing anecdotes about this place when it first opened. I finally had the opportunity to go there, and I have firmly decided this is not my cup of tea. I have not tried any of the food here so I can't give you a honest review about the whole experience, other than what I experienced as a pseudo alcoholic. Hmmm...where do I begin? Ah, yes. Let's discuss the clientele. Before I proceed, I am throwing a little disclaimer out there so I won't step on any feelings...I have a tendency to utilize the word \"douchebag\" a lot. It's a part of my daily vocabulary. Honestly, can you blame me? I live within close proximity of the watering hole of these aforementioned creatures that seem to spawn at an alarming rate. So, if you are easily offended, you may want to gloss over my review and make the more favorable ones your focal point. The bartenders, from what I can recall, were not very prompt in answering drink orders. I remember waiting around, locking eyes with the bartenders and feeling slightly pathetic. My heart isn't pitter pattering over your Adonis-like looks, Mr. Bartender. I am in need of a beverage to quench my thirst, and it would please me greatly if you could ask me what my little heart desires. The place is also quite small, and for anyone that easily gets claustrophobic, it may present a huge problem. It gets packed during the weekends, and you will be the victim of numerous foot steppers. By the end of the night, you can boast to your friends about your battle wounds. Granted, as with any bar/club, it is a common occurrence. All in all, this place is something I can take in doses. I have heard from numerous friends that the happy hour is decent, so perhaps I will harbor no ill feelings and check it out at a decent hour. Like a moth to a flame, I find myself strangely drawn to this place. I may not like it very much, but we always stop there. It just might be one of those mysteries of life that will go unanswered for generations to come."}
{"text":"If you want to surround yourself with a bunch of douchebags wearing Ed Hardy-esque clothing, enough hair gel to set the place on fire, and too much cologne, then El Hefe is the place to be!  That, however, is not my taste.  I can't comment on the food because, after spending one Saturday night drinking there, I have never wanted to go back.  Plus, I can't imagine trying to eat while inhaling all of the aforementioned cologne.  I'll stick to DJ's, my \"dive bar\" down the street, thank you."}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place.. I went with my wife and some friends on Friday night to celebrate my wife's promotion and got racial profiled by the guy checking ID's I was wearing shorts and a plain black tee and when I got to the front of the line the bouncer told me \"your shorts are too baggy\" then proceeded to tell me that they dont allow black tees in the place. I looked around and half the people inside were wearing solid tees and also the gentleman behind me was also wearing a black tee but was able to go in with no issues. I felt just because I'm a Mexican guy with a bald head and tattoos I was profiled as a gang banger and was not allowed to get in to a so called \"Mexican\" restaurant. Never judge a book by its cover people. I'm a dad of 5 kids and husband to a beautiful wife. I own my own home and make decent money but because of the way I look I wasn't allowed to get in. I will never be going to this place again and ill make sure to spread the word on how I was treated."}
{"text":"Great drinks, tasty food, good atmosphere, fun servers (easy on the eyes too), and sweet indoor/outdoor feel.  I'd go again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went in for tacos today and were pretty disappointed with the food and service.  First our waitress asked us multiple times within like 5 minutes if we were ready to order, which we thought was strange.  I asked her if they carried 1800 coconut flavored tequila. She didn't know, so she asked the bartender. She said they \"probably\" usually have it, but were \"out\" right now. I then asked how much they charge for a floater on a drink (which is usually just a drizzle of liqueur on top of your drink). She asked the bartender, came back and said, \"We don't have anything for floaters except for Red Bull, but I doubt you want red bull on your drink.\" I let her know what a floater is since she clearly was not aware. Then I ordered a drink for my boyfriend to try and specially asked for Cointreau as a float. She said, \"con- what?\" I said, \"Cointreau\"... So she said she would go ask the bartender. She came back and said the bartender has never heard of Cointreau and that she's \"never had a request like that\". I took their menu out and pointed directly to where it states that COINTREAU is in one of their margaritas. (What an insane request, right guys?)  So she took my menu from me and brought it to the bartender. She was gone for a while, but came back and said \"We don't have that here. The closest thing to that is Grand Marnier. Oh and that'll be $9.\" -I never got my menu back- So I guess I'm just in disbelief that they were dumbfounded over the fact that I asked for something they say they offer and instead of just asking the manager to come speak with me, she went back and forth with the bartender basically telling us we are wrong and then tried to charge us $9 for a floater of Grand Marnier, which is commonly used as a float, so WHY would she tell us earlier that they don't have floaters. First off, if you have any kind of liquor in the restaurant at all, you then have a floater. I kindly declined such a fabulous offer. These people just don't make sense.  Irritated and unimpressed, he just ordered a Blue Moon.  For lunch, my boyfriend ordered 3 tacos. The ground beef, carne asada, and chicken. He said the ground beef was the only flavorful one out of the three.  While eating the chicken taco, he noticed he was chewing on a bone. It was the size of a nickel. I understand that this will happen time to time at a restaurant, but it definitely did not help with the already bad impression. We kindly let the waitress know and when she offered a discount, I just said, \"Oh that's fine. We just wanted the chef to know for his own information.\" She took the taco off of our check anyways, which was nice.  I ordered the avocado taco and the carne asada taco. The avocado taco was not bad. It had flavor and it was interesting that the avocado was fried. The carne asada taco was bland.  I asked twice for limes and finally received a cup of juiceless dried up limes- kind of like the orange slice on the Blue Moon, except not as dry. Keep in mind, we were 2 out of approximately 6 people in the whole restaurant, so I don't know why the service was so bad.   One star for existing. Good for you.   Ps- The food runner was very nice."}
{"text":"Strictly reviewing as a restaurant.. This place is great, when I tell people some of my favorite tacos in Arizona are at El Hefe, they think I'm crazy. They have great choices and are reasonably priced on some days, but I go up on Tuesdays. My favorite is the duck taco, absolutely nothing wrong with it, texture, taste, and spices are on point."}
{"text":"El Hefe has 2 dollar tacos all day on Tuesdays just because. So stop by,they have at least 6 or 7 different tacos to try! All delicious at the most and don't forget to stop by for their tootin happy hour as well from 3 to 7 Monday thru Friday!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a drink and hang out.  Food was great,  service was awsome!  Bartender Mikey was on point and managers Jamie and Sean were on top of their game.  Def.  will be back"}
{"text":"This place has bomb.com tacos the (shrimp tacos) are the best. The atmosphere is fun and inviting! Also the Churro's are on point! Happy hour specials are Great! I wouldn't suggest bringing your grandma here, definitely bring your friends instead."}
{"text":"Great margaritas, good food, good service.  Went here with our three kids and they easily accommodated us and their kid food preferences."}
{"text":"Great HH - 4-7 with a $5 32 oz beer margarita and $2 tacos. The tacos were good, Carne asada was my fav. Guac not as good as I expected but over all pretty good.  The atmosphere is more \"cluby\" than I expected (my husband ate at the one in Tempe and said so as well) but I love how open the restaurant is.   Overall, I would come back - just wish they were open for lunch as that \"crowd\" would be better for a meal with my husband or a friend."}
{"text":"Tacos! Isn't that what it's all about? I got the three taco special, which came with a choice of a side. The black beans were excellent. I liked that I was able to switch up the type of tacos and of course, I chose three different types. Sorry, I can't honestly comment which ones were which, or how each were. Why? It took forever to get our six tacos!   The service wasn't good. We were there on a weekday during lunch. It was packed! The waitress seemed to be the only wait staff in the entire restaurant. She was literally running from table to table. We ordered the chips and salsa (free with a Yelp check-in) and guacamole. When she placed the chips and salsa down on the table, in a quick hot second I turned my head to ask about the guacamole and she was gone, I told you, literally running from table to table.   The atmosphere is a college sports bar with an Americanized Mexican twist. Most people were sipping on margaritas early on in the day and it was already pretty loud. Not a place I'd recommend for kids."}
{"text":"Ordered a drink and the waitress took my order and went to clock out and proceeded to go home without giving my order to another. I got the check and went next door to Dierks Bentley. The bartenders were only interested in serving the male customers."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. My friend recommended hitting it up for a Taco Tuesday, but I decided to come tonight instead. The steak tacos are where it's at. Ate 3 of them! 5 start for sure"}
{"text":"This place is always a shit-show but so entertaining. Good dj's, good drinks, and the bartenders know what they're doing and are friendly. I hear they have food too..."}
{"text":"Had a nice time at El Hefe. My waitress was friendly and competent. The restaurant was very cool. I went on a Wednesday night so it was pretty empty, not a lot going on.  I ordered the 3 tacos; chicken, pork and carne. All were very good. All had very different tastes and had a nice presentation. I recommend the chips and salsa because the salsa was delicious for some reason. I would go back."}
{"text":"First time here. Heard the tacos were good. Was shocked to see they have been beat up on Yelp. I decided to make sure I didn't let that bias get in the way of my real experience or perception. Was pleased to see free guac and chips upon my first check in. Nice to see a decent give away for a check in. The guac was great. Chip are thin like I em. Appeared to be made fresh. Ordered a steak and a chicken street taco. Not very big but about the norm for a gourmet taco. Chicken was shredded and in a type of sweet sauce. Was yummy. Both were good but not awesome. The service was was great. Was checked on by multiple people. I think they are making an effort to fix customer service issues. My visit wasn't during rush hour. So all I can say is that the service was great, atmosphere was cool, TVs were very nice and everywhere and the food was good."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa were really good. Especially for $3. $4 more dollars to add the guac! I didn't add the guac. I got 2 tacos. One carne asada and one shrimp. There were 3 shrimp that were on the taco butterflied to lool like 6. It was ok tasting... Kinda burnt tasting. The carne asada taco would have been good but that too was burnt tasting. Probably won't eat here again. Also note: no Budwiser products for a Mexican Restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"It's clearly time for me to write an update since I am the duchess and all. What can I say. I love this place. I used to hate it and judge on it hard core but let's just say I'm going through a phase where I'm reliving my younger early 20's. (If you thought to yourself, but wait! Isn't she like only 24? Then bless your heart and we should be BFF).  I mean I'm pretty much here at LEAST once a week. Most likely 2-3 times. Mostly to rage face on the weekends. Sunday Funday? DUH. I'm usually pretty hamskied by the time I walk over here but I'm pretty sure you can find me dancing somewhere around the bar.   I can say that now have actually eaten the food here and it's def better than I thought it was gonna be. I've had brunch here before...they don't do bottomless but they do like a $15 schooner and then penny refills. Not mad at it. I can't remember what I had for brunch but I'm pretty sure I didn't eat it bc I was hung over and about to vom. But I think the bite or two that I did have were pretty tasty. The tacos are pretty good too - I've had the steak, chicken and beef cheek. Beef cheek is probs my fav. Get it. Don't be a puss.   Hefe is in my little hot corner and I do love me some of that hot corner - it's always packed! but I think with Bottled Blonde opening up, there's been a little more breathing room.   Hefe..hefe..hefe..**sigh** so many blurred memories. All of which I'm sure were a great time."}
{"text":"Hands down best spot to be on mill ave. Great food/drinks, tons of energy, great looking staff and CONFETTI! Always have a blast at Hefe!"}
{"text":"Never a dull night at El Hefe Scottsdale. Diesel always throws down the best beats, the staff keeps the energy live and Marlee is an absolute babe!"}
{"text":"Im from san diego and i have never experienced racism like i did tonight! I had six girls and three guys but cuz my black friend wore shorts 2\"too long cuz hes 6'3\" they denied him. I called out 4 other white guys not to dress code in the club and all they can do is give excuses! It pissed me off, I was so disappointed that i took all my friends else where (easily got in) and spent my money where i didnt feel prejudice! Im sorry tempe but if this is what they have to offer...fuck you! I respect people and dont judge on their skin color, i have video proof and for me i will not endorse anyone to come here!"}
{"text":"Honestly not impressed with this place, although it is one of the first places that grabbed my attention when we moved to town. We went for dinner and had tacos, chips and guacamole. I went again for happy hour with co-workers. Both times we were practically the only customers and the food was mediocre. I'm guessing this is a late night drink spot/hangout, so I can't comment on that vibe. I won't go out of my way to go here again."}
{"text":"I'm having a Scottsdale over dose and loving it!!!! I love the setting, the place is fun, it was pack and still service was excellent, always checking if I needed a drink (I was sitting at the bar) the staff was incredible friendly and the music was good. I still would enjoyed more if they had a live band, but makes sense its not the kind of place. The drinks were good also, the beer very cold and the cocktails  well served. I will probably become a regular but I have still much discovering to do in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Do NOT go here for food. We went here last Thursday around 7pm and it was completely dead, still the waitress walked by us numerous times without ever asking if we wanted water, drinks or food. After 30 minutes we just walked to the bar and ordered our drinks and food there. The waitress NEVER once stopped at our table to \"check on us\" and she spent a lot of the time in the back and was nowhere in site along with the bartender (we only saw two girls working). Around 8pm my friend arrived and she had to ALSO go to the bar to order her food or drinks or flag down the waitress to order something. There were only 2 other tables in the restaurant so its not like she was super busy, she didnt even acknowledge us or apologize for not coming to the table. We felt completely ignored the entire time and she would snicker at us when we would try to get her attention and she ignored us (group of 6). we were wanting to keep drinking all night but closed our tab and left to another bar where our service and tip money was appreciated. I NEVER tip $0 but i had to for this case, we tipped the bartender on the drinks we ordered but that waitress didnt deserve even $1 which i have never done. Even on bad service I usually leave 15%, but NO SERVICE i left $0. Do not go here if you want to get ignored."}
{"text":"Im going to update this and give kudos to the manager for taking my yelp review into consideration.  I do appreciate good hospitality.  I cannot yet say if I will return. But again, kudos for reaching out to me."}
{"text":"This place has the best tacos in the area!! I work right by El Hefe and I go there all the time for their amazing tacos. The atmosphere is fun and the service is great as well. I highly recommend the chicken tacos, nachos and the salty chihauhua!"}
{"text":"This is one of my least favorite places in all of Phoenix. I'll grant you that I'm more than a little biased against 'clubs' in general (I'd rather relax, talk, and laugh than get bumped around, shout, and pay $15 for a whiskey after waiting in line for 15 minutes).   That being said, this place is the worst of the worst as far as clientele goes. Every Phoenician has heard of the $35K / year Scottsdale millionaire. Well, this is where they all come on Friday and Saturday nights to take on more crushing credit card debt so they can pop some bottles and impress some trashy women.   Are you a male in your twenties that likes cranberry mixers, works in 'finance' (read: entry level teller at Chase), leases a 328i, is not above slipping something in a girl's drink, and pretends to be some kind of pseudo-cowboy hardass at Country Thunder once a year? Then you'll love it here among your friends.  Are you a woman that is attracted to the aforementioned Scottsdale Bro? You'll love it here as well."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks - prices were good. Staff was attentive and there was a great atmosphere. Had the mamacita margarita and chips & guac (which is free when using the Yelp coupon) tacos were amazing and the place was clean and had both inside and outside seating. Would recommend and come back."}
{"text":"My friend and I tried to try out El Hefe last night. We got carded at the door, it was about 10pm. I thought it was a restaurant, so I was kinda confused. We sat at a high top table outside. We sat there for 20 minutes and no one came over. Maybe there are no servers outside, and I just don't know the El Hefe procedures? Anyway, we left. Went to Fuzzys and had a great time. I won't try again."}
{"text":"People usually drop bottles, start fights or have dance offs on the corner. The music is tacky and the prices are terrible. Unless some one else is paying for the drinks, ladies, enjoy. Otherwise this is just another Mill Bar."}
{"text":"Oh El Hefe, just about my favorite bar of all time. This place is like half bar half club and it's awesome, I've never seen anything like it (the closest thing I've ever seen to it would be Coyote Ugly). There are literally gorgeous girls dancing on the bar pouring tequila in people's mouths, it's insanity. All the bartenders/servers are basically supermodels too. They have pretty good food too but sometimes the service takes a little longer (sometimes supermodels aren't the sharpest). But seriously this place is awesome for a night out or even great for happy hour and they have good music! When I lived in Scottsdale I would always take my friends that were visiting to hefe and they absolutely loved it, definitely a go to bar of mine when i'm in town"}
{"text":"Pros : The food and drinks are okay ...   Cons : Horrible horrible horrible customer service the staff is awful it took 15 mins to place an order. (Not busy just got ignored by staff) When we finally interacted with the server she was rude and got the order wrong. I would suggest only coming when it's a club to avoid this ordeal .."}
{"text":"Tips:  Mamacita Margarita is sweet as the description makes it sound. A great girly version of their margaritas. The margaritas are pretty massive in size.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Carne Asada Fries - Super yummy! The fries themselves are thin seasoned fries with steak and cheese toppings on top of it. Highly recommend this appetizer.  Al Pastor Taco $3.00 - The red sauce on the al pastor taco has a sweet taste to it which was unique in my opinion.  Carne Asada Taco $4.00 - Pretty good carne asada taco  Overall the food was not bad, though a bit pricey, but that is expected in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I have visited  this establishment multiple times this past year. Decent food and drinks, but a bit overpriced for the quality. What ended it for me was the rude wait staff and bartender. Won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Ordered a 7 dollar drink and tipped 3 dollars. Came back a bit later and was told I would not be served by any of the bar staff because I were too cheap. Extremely rude and a huge turn off considering I have come here at least once a week for the past 3 months. Will stick with Casa down the road from now on."}
{"text":"Very fun bar but INFAMOUS FOR HAVING CONSTANT PHONE THIEFS!!!! Be very aware of your belongs please ladies! I know wayyyyyy too many people that have gotten their phone stolen here. Try getting hooked up with a promoter and sticking to a table all night so you're away from the dance floor crowd! It's way more fun that way anyways :)"}
{"text":"Again with the hype for Old Town bars... Yet another friend said, \"You have to try ABC Bar\", this time being El Hefe. Yet another bar failed to live up to the recommendation.  (Though in retrospect, her recommendation was probably due to her running into the same old man who liked to buy all her drinks every time... should have taken that into account).  Strike 1: So loud I can't hear myself. Literally engaging my diaphragm and voice projection training just to make myself heard to my friends and the waitresess.  Strike 2: The tacos are not that great. They have duck, which is the only really saving grace about them, but they're like $5 for this little tiny,1/4 of a tortilla sized taco. They tasted pretty boring to me.  Strike 3: I had to hunt down my waitress. I mean, I walked around for 10 minutes looking for her to cash out, and this place is SMALL. I was very tempted to walk out on the tab just due to the crappy service..  Strike 4: We got water dumped on us due to the awnings outside. The manager sent us a round of shots, and he wasn't fooling anybody, they were pure grapefruit juice. Gee, thanks for filling my Vitamin C requirement...?  Oh snap, 4 strikes and you are definitely out of the park for good, El Hefe."}
{"text":"This establishment employees racist p.o.s security and door guards. My friends and I had a table and they refused to let him, us, in because of my Black friend's attire, now I'm Black too but I'm light* and I'm a female. No rips or basketball shoes allowed but right in front of me is white people looking that way inside! Fffffforget y'all.   I've been here for work with my liquor company for many years and have witnessed much racism. The place is sweaty and cramped and the regular staff will literally run over you to do their jobs, making any vendor work very difficult. The women who work behind the bar are typically rude and \"over it\", also not experienced in drink names or how to pour. It is true the place and floor are very dirty but I don't care about that myself.  This review won't change a darn thing because all these clubs are run by the same rich people and it won't affect them but maybe it will save your evening. Food is garbage and overpried as well just go to a real eating establishment if you want that."}
{"text":"Not a bad happy hour. $3 tacos, $4 cheese quesadilla and $6 queso fundido dip. And the music is pretty hip. Nice selection of draft beers. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Yo Bartender is a huge b*tch said she's wasn't gonna  serve me cause I didn't tip her after I tipped her 10 for my first drink, good music tho"}
{"text":"Currently here enjoying a house Margarita! I had the Mahi Mahi tacos, which were pretty good I enjoyed the toppings that were on them. The rice was a little dry but other than that it's good. Bathrooms were clean and the atmosphere is really chill at this time. It turns into a dance spot at night and they open up the patio. Nice place to chill and eat during the day if you like Mexican food."}
{"text":"Ok so I have been here before and the experience wasn't that bad, that's why I went back - well that was a mistake! P.S. My review will be similar to the one for Hi Fi because, well, they both sucked the same!   I went last Saturday night and this place was like a sardine can!! SUPER wayy too packed! There was NO room for dancing, or even just mingling. Frankly, you couldn't even breathe!! Brushing elbows? More like brushing noses! It was miserable and as soon as I felt my claustrophobia kicking in I needed to escape! We were about to leave when this guy started talking to me, lucky for me he did because we found a small 2 feet by 2 feet area we could a least attempt to dance in as they started to play some awesome salsa jams. Best 5 minutes of music we had heard all night so we bounced our little hearts out, all of the white guys in complete shock at seeing these two little Latin fire crackers break it down lol, annnnd then we left.   Seriously though, who wants to \"party\" like that?? I want to be able to mingle, get a drink fairly quick, DANCE and I don't know have room to breathe and chill out. I know places may be popular and \"thee place to be\", but it would seem way more exclusive and maybe even worth paying entry if the atmosphere was right.  Like really EL HEFE they have \"maximum occupancy\" laws for a reason! I could not imagine what would happen if a fire broke out! This place is not only NOT fun, but also NOT safe!   I don't see myself ever going back on a Sat night. The ONLY reason I gave them 2 stars and not 1 is because my friend and I didn't have to wait in their long ass line. We walked up to the front and they just let us in lol."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for their delicious bloody mary with bacon in it this place woulda got 3 stars from me. Their Tostadas were bomb and their chips with corn dip (i cant remember the name of it) was great as well."}
{"text":"Worse bartender and service I have ever had the bartender Alyssa was rude and needs a few lessons on how to treat customers"}
{"text":"Old town dress code for mill ave, plus the dress code only applies to people of color"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in town for the Monster Mash at Tempe Beach Park and Had met up with some friends for drinks here. I ordered Red Bull and Vodka and would say the drinks were ok. Didn't really seem like they put much vodka in with the Red Bull. I should've just stuck with beer.   Also, the security guy was a major douche and had superiority complex. Ugh. Our server was nice but also slow.   Based on the reviews and photos of the food, I would've never came anyway, but like I said, we were meeting some friends who were already here. I wouldn't come back if I was ever in the area again."}
{"text":"Employees are rude, slow and indifferent.  Good and drinks are expensive and poorly made. There are so many better choices on Mill, avoid this one."}
{"text":"First off, it's a great looking bar which has a supreme location right in the heart of Old Town. We stopped by last night to meet a friend for drinks and to have a look around. This is the first bar in town (that I know of) with beer taps built right into the tables (Coors & XX). I will be back to sample the grub soon enough. Another excellent addition to Scottsdale's nightlife!"}
{"text":"This place is great for happy hour. $2 tacos, $5 32oz Coronas and Tecates and $5 margaritas. There tacos are delicious especially after a couple cervezas. They play great music, have good service and oh, did I mention a beer tap at your table? Not one of those tall things that pour 5 or 6 beers, and actual tap hooked up to a keg of Dos Equis and Coors light. I haven't stayed long enough to see this place morph into a night club, but it is worth checking out for happy hour anyday from 3-7PM."}
{"text":"Being an extremely popular spot on mill avenue (a college town) many people have different perceptions of what to expect. El Hefe does not fit any of the negatives you frequently hear about bars in mill. The food they have to offer is off the charts, I highly recommend trying the avocado taco even if it may seem a bit different. It is absolutely amazing. I have never ordered something here that I did not like. The service both bar and dining setting are above and beyond. Both the food and drinks pretty much come out as soon as the \"tender\" of your service has gone to enter them. On Fridays is when I love going in with my friends as they ironically have a \"friends on Friday\" deal. Half off their killer bulldog-garita, and select $2 tacos. Can't beat it. Night life at this spot is the exact same minus the food, still exceptional service even with a huge wall to wall crowd. They also sometimes bring out a taco cart on the patio for super late night with great food before you hit the road home for the night. Would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Tacos on special during Happy Hour were good, unique. Not impressed with the ambiance and service. Didn't feel like staff was in the mood to work. We were there soon after 5."}
{"text":"Went for dancing and drinks on Saturday night and had an absolute blast!  Girls dancing on the bar pouring tequila into waiting mouths... YAY!  A bar that knows how to party right!"}
{"text":"I've been going to El Hefe for years and have always had the BEST time! My brother was visiting and he was buying a drink for himself. Sunday August 7th he was at the bar and ordered a drink for himself the bartender gave him 4 drinks and he had told her he only had ordered one for himself. The bartenders responded \"You pay for all four or none.\" So he paid for all 4 drinks. A larger woman had accidentally bumped into him and he had accidentally spilt a little of his drink on her. She slapped him so hard and then he had dropped all four drinks on her from being slapped so hard. The bouncer immediately grabbed him by the neck and pushed him out the door. How he was treated was not right or fair. Please feel free to look at video footage."}
{"text":"Just had drinks, but the selection was great, location was awesome.  Great atmosphere. Our waitress, Andi, was great!"}
{"text":"Who knew Hefe had great food?! Not me!   I come here often during the night scene, but I recently stopped in for Happy Hour. Their tacos were SO DELCIOUS! Full of flavor, perfectly executed and garnished. I also sampled my friends Carne Asada Fries. OMG BEST I'VE EVER HAD! Was eating off two plates. ;P   The waitress was super sweet and prompt.   Michelada was okay.. nothing too special. Next time I want to try one of their famous margaritas!  And what?!? TWO Check in offers?! DEF coming in again!"}
{"text":"I have never been here for anything other than drinks but I always have a great time.  The music is probably what brings me here the most.  Worst part is the lines to get in.  Be sure to beat the line to avoid waiting the night away to get through the door."}
{"text":"This place is okay. Came here for a 21st birthday. Nothing special about it. Service was okay and food was room temp/almost cold despite the menu stating everything was cooked from scratch. However, it still tasted okay. The DJ kind of sucks, honestly. The music is SO loud and it's obnoxious. Heard the same song played in a span of 15 mins."}
{"text":"What was the point of opening a second Hooter's right down the street from another one? I almost feel bad for the girls who are forced to degrade themselves in booty shorts and low-cut halter tops, but then again, half the chicks on Mill dress that way anyway. I guess being leered at all day by half-drunk frat boys really grinds on you, so maybe that explains the extraordinarily bad service.  Our hostess forgot to tell the waitress we were seated, so that took forever to even get drinks. Then, she forgot to bring our appetizers. All that would've been fine -- some people just have bad days -- but the food was somehow beneath actual street tacos and more bland than Chili's.   Couple all this with the obnoxious top 40 blaring from the speakers and every TV tuned to some idiotic sports spectacle and you'll understand why I hope this place burns to the ground. Leave this shit in Scottsdale, where it belongs."}
{"text":"I hate to give only 2 stars because the food was very good. But the service was so awful I will not come back for just the food. It's a seat yourself restaurant and only empty tables were dirty. No servers or employees around to ask to clean one. Finally started cleaning it ourselves and this brought someone over. The server was very spotty in attendance. Drinks only filled one time and we were there for an hour for chips n guacamole, a salad and a torta. I am very surprised at the lack of service.  Manager no where to be found to talk to either."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour and we came on a taco Tuesday. $2 street tacos and big margaritas with a corona sticking out is a great way to enjoy a night in Tempe! The atmosphere was great, the weather was nice and the food was great. Not sure what else we could ask for!  As a tip make sure to try each of the different tacos as they all had a unique flavor."}
{"text":"Although el hefe is known as a \"bar\" or a place to \"sunday funday,\" they should also be recognized for their AMAZING taco tuesday. They have $2 tacos that are a fairly good size and absolutely delicious! I love this place! Also, be sure to ask for the bartender Sean. He is the best!!!!"}
{"text":"It's funny because I've gone in on a Friday night literally wearing Nike sneakers and they've let me in but apparently my friends' boyfriends aren't good enough for this place.  They were both wearing GUCCI sneakers.  The tattooed security guard wearing a Cake shirt said they were underdressed.  Not even 5 minutes later they let in a white guy in Adidas.  You're frickin kidding me.  Way to make it obvious as hell that their skin color was the reason and not their attire. I used to love getting tables here but never again.  Stupid pretentious bar, you just lost my business.  Now I've realized why all my friends used to cringe when I'd say \"let's get a table at Hefe!\"  Maybe y'all should stop catering to the college scene and go for people who actually have money.  Racist as hell"}
{"text":"Who charges hot sauce at a Mexican restaurant? Apparently El Hefe does and didn't even bother to be up front about it. We ordered tacos and asked for hot sauce, so the waitress asked us if we wanted \"Pico De Gallo, Salsa Verde or Salsa roja\". So we said bring all three. When we got our bill she charges us a $1 each for the little salsa she brought out. If she informed us about charging us then we might as well got the chips and salsa for $3 that already comes with the 3 salsas.    Also, our tacos were cold by the time she brought them out and service was slow when we asked for our check. Not sure why it was slow because it was only my party of 4 and a couple that were the only ones in there other the the 4 other people at the bar, so we wrote a note why we only gave 10% tip.   However, we passed by again at night and it loooked poppin!! The nightlife here is probably the spot for this place because dining in during the day was not the business."}
{"text":"El Hefe was so fun! Our bartender Camren was so great every time I came to the bar he knew  my order and showed the best smile."}
{"text":"El Hefe has a wonderful happy hour with cheap drinks and tacos. The fried avocado taco is great for vegetarians. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is confused. It wants to be a sports bar, restaurant and dance club and as a result, it does none of them very well.  The food (I had the $3 tacos during happy hour) was decent, but nothing remarkable or earth shattering. The $3 beers were a hit with our group, but to a person (there were six of us), no one had anything nice to say about their food. Just sorta good, but not great.  Other than having some TV's which you can't hear over their music, I don't see how they can call themselves a sports bar...that doesn't even make sense. Maybe it changes during football season, but it isn't anything like a sports bar at the moment.  As for a dance club, we didn't stay to see it, but there is a large rectangular bar in the middle of the place and a DJ station at one end. I guess the dance floor would be between the DJ and the end of the bar which is not a large space. They were preparing for bottle service while we were there, and the wait staff was preoccupied.   Overall, I think this place needs a manager who cares about customer service enough to impart that to the employees, because it feels like they believe that you should be grateful to be there and not the other way around."}
{"text":"I've been here twice during Taco Tuesday night and it's a nice spot to hang out and have a few drinks. I don't think the tacos are the best but they are pretty cheap. I ordered the house margarita and it tasted like a normal house marg. During my second visit I didn't get the tacos and went with a Chicken Quesadilla which wasn't too bad at all. Also ordered a glass of Merlot and I was feeling great!"}
{"text":"Fun for Friday and Saturday nights. Also great on Sunday afternoon. Only one problem is that the line for guys is extremely long and unless you go early enough so you don't have to wait, that's the only way you're getting in.. Well that's unless you're a good looking woman then you're always getting in.. Great place though!!"}
{"text":"Went to El Hefe with some friends and really loved the atmosphere and the food! We sat at a booth w the old school taps (still cold/can't use) and had great service! I ordered the Queso Fundido and Chicken nachos for the table and everything was delicious! Had great drinks, great food, great service. When in Scottsdale hit this place up! Was awesome at 4pm and apparently gets crazy fun later in the evening!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE WILL TAKE YOUR CASH AND STILL CHARGE YOUR CARD.  I go to Old Town on a weekly basis; I am young and love to have fun, who doesn't?! I have never had any issues in old town until my birthday bash at El Hefe. My friends and I wanted to get a table with bottle service because hey, you only turn 26 once. Now, I knew gong in how much the table was, I brought the cash along with my friends who were pitching in too. However they wanted my card to hold the table, which left me a little anxious, I told the manager \"Don't charge my card, I have cash for this table\" he understood with a head nod and said \"of course.\" I am introduced to our little petite blonde waitress/bartender, I also tell her \"Bring me the check and I'll pay for this table with cash, just do not charge my card.\" She understood and said \"Okay, no problem.\" As the night goes on and drinks are pouring, our waitress gave me the bill with my card and ID, I gave her the cash, didn't sign anything, told the waitress, \"Here is the cash\" and she left, didn't see her the rest of the night. Saturday morning I see a charge on my card for $254.50! So she took my cash, along with all my other friends who pitched in and still charged my card. I called the bar, no answer. Disputed with my bank... big help there ... and now I am here, warning you, fellow yelpers, that there are plenty of other bars in old town, mill avenue, desert ridge, west gate, and downtown, just as good, not as crowded, and not a huge rip off from any bartenders or managers.   Am I bitter? ... Yes ... Will this stop me from having fun? ... No but if I can prevent another person getting ripped off like I did, well this post was worth it. Good luck! Be safe! and check your bank accounts in the morning, just in case ;)  Oh and almost forgot, Ryan Hibbert (managing partner for the El Hefe, Whiskey Row, etc) I will be posting on multiple review sites to bring awareness of the service these bars are giving. No one likes to be taken advantage of."}
{"text":"Love this place mysic is great and the bartenders are always nice!  Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"So this is a review strictly about the nightlife at El Hefe. When I come here at the end of a long night of drinking, this place is amazing. The lighting is good, sometimes they have dancers on the bar, and the music is really high energy. HOWEVER, do not come here unless you are a bit drunk or you'll be fist pumping to techno all night sober-YUCK. I once made the mistake of making this place my first of the night, and I ended up just leaving because it was boring. I was also getting shoved and pushed from all angles due to drunk college students (mainly guys, this was a complete sausage fest) who smelled like armpits and desperation."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Waiters ignore you when you attempt to ask them a question. If you have a reservation you still have to wait an hour when the entire place has empty tables everywhere. Waiters have an attitude like if they are bothered they have to do their job. I come here often because I love the food but I have to sacrifice the service and the long waits even though there will be tables available. Horrible customer service !"}
{"text":"When they kick you out for commenting on their drinks... Served water when asked for vodka soda.. first drink i could tell it was water"}
{"text":"Horrible place to go. The bouncers WILL ruin your time before you even get in and anywhere in old town is better than this place"}
{"text":"The tacos were so good. I had just the regular ground beef and it was the best ground beef taco I've ever had. Definitely recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Went here to use a local dines coupon, otherwise I don't think we would have ever gone here. Greeted by a friendly person, who sat us in a booth (first lead us to a table and I saw the taps at the booths and wanted to try that!!).  Small place with everything opened up to the patio, the weather was perfect. Very good service from our waitress, with a good explanation of the taps, happy hour, and menu.  Speaking of the menu, it is a short menu that is somewhat hard to read.  We could tell we were going to be hard pressed to spend the $30 worth of coupon we had!!   I ordered a salad (very large) and mushroom taco (very small).  It all filled me up and tasted great.  Hubby ordered chicken torte aka sandwich which was good and spicy enough. This is definitely a hip place for young folks!  We were there early but were warned they expected a huge crowd (Thanksgiving Eve) later on.   We enjoyed pouring our own beers (happy hour prices are very good!), however when the bill came, our waitress had failed to charge us for the beers!  We had to get her attention again and have her ring up the proper amount (which turned out be under $2 a beer!)  Of course using a coupon we tipped according to the full price, and we were very satisfied with the service. The biggest drawback for me was..............smoking is allowed out on the patio and the place is small, so we had to smell this during our meal and I am allergic to smoke!!  Plus the music was very loud and we couldn't converse much.   However it was a fun experience and different.  We left still feeling like we didn't get our Mexican food fix."}
{"text":"Our server Haylee was fantastic! We came here for taco Tuesday and had a great time! The food and drinks just added to our great experience."}
{"text":"This place is in a great location and sweet patio. Great place for people watching also.  The food was very average. Tried 3 different tacos and though the mahi mahi was the best. Had the nachoes and again very average. Cheese was extremely thick and random clumps of taco seasoned ground beef in there.   Service was average to good. The college-aged girls working there were friendly, attentative. Waitress did forget an order, but nice about it."}
{"text":"It's taco Tuesday, offering good food and promo pricing.  Patrons get free guacamole and chips with your Yelp check in. The Ice-Tea is passion fruit flavored,my favorite.  Lots of TVs and attractive coed servers round out the package. El Hefe works for me.  In the words of Arnold Schwarzenegger and I quote \"I'll be back\".   Salute!"}
{"text":"Had EXCELLENT service! Brittany was so sweet and very attentive! Love coming here, great patio and great vibes all around! 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"The Spicy Marg was delicious.  The burrito bowl was fresh! I also appreciated the yelp check in salsa freebie.   Service was ok Definitely a college spot - I felt like they were trying to throw a hooters vibe  Great place to catch a game with all the big screens Prob would not go back."}
{"text":"Good place to get drunk at. Haven't tried food. Looked like the menu was a little off the beaten path. But seems like everyone who ate there enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Yah, so in town from denver. Thought this place looked cool. Wouldn't let me in because I was wearing flip flops. Seriously, you know you are in Phoenix right? Get over yourself!"}
{"text":"Great vibe!  Cool patio. The street tacos were awesome and the milk shake is a must try!  My kids loved it."}
{"text":"was in on sunday the bartenders were slinging it and a bunch of snobby girls were causing a scene and cussing out the bartenders who were not at fault i would have had security kick them out but thank god they left wish i got the bartenders name but they were all very fast it will be a stop every time i visit"}
{"text":"When we walked in it was about 9pm. We wanted to get dinner here. Bouncer let us in and no one approached us so we assumed it was open seating. Sat down and waited about 20 min for a waitress. Apparently, they're supposed to seat you even though theres no hostess stand or anything that indicates that! Waiting staff was okay they were pretty quick once they realized no one was helping us. We got the carne asada fries and macho bowl. Pretty good, I'd categorize it as bar food, nothing fancy."}
{"text":"Great place!  We went at night and the place was bouncing with people... Mostly a young crowd.. Not a family place at night.. More like a night club.  We went for food,  ordered the carne asada street tacos,  and the Jefe Burger.  Both just perfect.  The tacos were at point,  juicy seasoned meat on small corn tortillas.  The meat on the Burger was tender and pretty juicy. Friendly staff. I would return!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place while visiting the Tempe Arts Festival.  We were seated at a table outside which was neat because then we could people watch.  Unfortunately, the service here is very slow. The server didn't come around enough. We started with an appetizer of chips and salsa. There was no extra charge for the big, long hair that came in the pile of chips. That was gross. Had to wait for someone to come around to ask for a new plate of chips. The food looked good when it was served, but we had no utensils. We asked the food runner, but he never was to be seen again. Hubby had to get up and go to the bar to get us napkins and utensils.  Food was better than expected for a bar.  Clearly this place works off of alcohol sales, because the girls were gorgeous, but the service sucked. I wouldn't recommend coming here to eat, but if you want to drink and have lots of eye candy, this is the place."}
{"text":"Wow, I mean it's the best bar on mill by a long shot..  Always a party and definitely brings in the hottest ASU crowd.  Bouncers at the door are always super nice.  There is usually a line when I go but it moves super fast. Now that the nice weather is here I will definitely be putting in some facetime on there outdoor patio.  Especially if they put that gorgeous Kryzlin on that outside bar.  Thanks El Hefe for bringing the fun."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the food and had to send my dish back. The chicken in my salad tasted like it was spoiled. No apologies, and was charged full price. Service was slow and it was not very busy. Won't be back. Not sure what is up with the extra tech fees they add to the bill. Was looking forward to visiting this restaurant. I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Not knowing anything about this place, I came by looking for some good Mexican food, basically just based on the name.  The place is younger and a little more trendy than places I would normally frequent.  However, the staff were VERY helpful, friendly, and cool, and the tacos were AMAZING!   I got one pastor taco, one Mahi Mahi taco, and one carne asada taco.  All were really good, but the Mahi Mahi was one of the best things I have eaten in a long time.  For me, especially just having gone to Italy, that is really saying something!  It was so good that I had to order another one.  I am sitting here trying to talk myself out of ordering more of them so I don't stuff myself to the point of not being able to walk.    I highly recommend El Hefe!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, although I was slightly confused by the theme. Really good Fresh Mexican food though!"}
{"text":"I've been here just a few times during restaurant hours so this review is based off the restaurant experience opposed to a bar-related review.  The food here is unique and for the most part phenomenal. You will find \"blends\" here that you may have never thought of but they are delicious and at a great price. I stopped by for my first \"Taco Tuesday\" here and enjoyed my meal. You can't get unique tacos for the combination of price and quality elsewhere in the area (this is coming from someone who's lived 10 min from Mexico). Additionally, the staff seems great and real friendly. Parking isn't the easiest but there are plenty of options."}
{"text":"Love this place and staff! By having place like El Hefe in Scottsdale there is no reason to leave town. Sunday fundays are my favorite time to go, if I do end up going out at night El Hefe is a must place to stop! Garrett G. is amazing host, he always makes sure that my friends and me have a great time, it's hard not to come back when service is so excellent! Thank you Garrett and Team El Hefe!!!"}
{"text":"Gave us free Sombreros at taco fest, this place is great! And they have really awesome margaritas!"}
{"text":"Don't go here. This place is racist and they only apply the dress code to non-white people. My black friend was turned away for wearing the same type of shoes that other people were wearing but yet they got in cause they were white."}
{"text":"They lost my debit card and couldn't care less.  No apologies,  just \"cancel the card\" was their response."}
{"text":"I've only been here on weekend nights when they're a bar only. I live in AZ and every time I come to Scottsdale I end up here since there's no cover. And every time I say I'm never coming back. They have a horrible layout for as crowded as it gets. The drinks are served in plastic cups and house well drinks taste like rubbing alcohol but still cost about $8. It gets disgusting in the summer because it's just way too crowded and the patio stays open to the bar. All they play is crappy top 20 EDM. DJ never takes song requests and just picks his nose behind a lap top. The only reason I ever came back to this dump is because of the group I was with, but next time I'd rather go home early."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beverage or 10 while my lady friend is shopping. Just sitting watching the Olympics enjoying my own company.  Great, friendly staff everyone minding their own business, then Hank walked in.  He was clearly  intoxicated and insisted on 2 shots, which the staff refused him. He started getting loud, I was glad he hadn't seen me.  Then I went to the men's. And he was in there washing hos feet in the sink.  I sneaked past him and when I came out he was gone, but he was back in the bar yelling about how much he hates me.  They called him a cab and got him out of there.  I recommend El Hefe I do not recommend Hank."}
{"text":"a great place to go to for bottomless mimosas, however, I'm not too sure if they still do that they used to have the most delicious French toast, it was to die for the menu changes when spring combs or summer comes, which is totally understandable"}
{"text":"Fish tacos were bomb. I enjoyed the club atom sphere at night. If go back if I was ever in Phoenix..."}
{"text":"What a fun place.  We came here on a Thursday and were lucky to get seated because pretty soon it was PACKED in here.  Good service, nice clean building, cool paintings on the wall, attractive people everywhere and just an overall fun atmosphere.  Order a bulldog to drink, but don't get the tacos.  They were weird.  I also came here on a Sunday and it was crazy.  It started to get crazy around 3 or 4.  Pretty soon people were dancing on tables, Mr T look a like was walking around pouring milagro down peoples' throats, beach balls flying etc.  My friend who just moved here from Seattle couldn't believe it.  He said it was like when he went to Mexico on vacation."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at El Hefe, but, judging by the food, I don't think I'd want to. The drinks here are rough....neon green margarita mix.... nothing fresh... mixed by scantily clad girls. If you want to listen to loud music and look at girls, this place is fine... if you want quality cocktails...try elsewhere."}
{"text":"I went here about a month ago and it was not a good experience. I went on a saturday night with a group of about 6 girls. We wanted to get some drinks, but we were unable to because the place was so crowded, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one (don't know how good the drinks may be). In the 20 minutes we were there I was hit in the head with a belt buckle (someone was swinging it.... really?!?!), my foot was stomped on, and a beer was poured on me. Not my kind of place at all. I would never come back, sorry guys."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot! They always play awesome music and make nights out super fun with the different themes the bottle girls do and the confetti    Went here for a friends birthday and they made it so fun with different signs and a giant light up \"El Hefe\" cake!"}
{"text":"If there were an option for less stars I would have selected that one. Don't let this place fool ya, when walking down mill it'll definitely grab your attention, but this place is a must avoid. The service was slow, drinks are way over priced and barely have any liquor in them. You have families in there along with servers who have their butt hanging out of their shorts. Nothing we had here was good, brought my wife here for date night since we are new to town and left highly disappointed. My drink had hunks of jalapeño in it and was in no way sweet. My wife's meal wasn't what she was expecting and we didn't even finish. Definitely needs to be closed or revamp the menu and the service. 52 bucks for 2 rather small plates and 2 margaritas that we didn't even touch. Smh"}
{"text":"The only plus to this place was that the bartenders are on their game, otherwise leave it for the Jersey Shore wannabes and slooters that get turned on by extra extra medium Tap Out t-shirts."}
{"text":"The service here is absolutely horrendous. We went for taco Tuesday and ended up regretting that we went. We were sat and the server came over to get our drink order, which was probably the only good thing of the night. My boyfriend got his beer, but I didn't get my water. We didn't see our server....or any other server.....for some time. We were ready to get up and just leave, but instead I asked a food runner to grab our server who we hadn't seen. A different server came over to take our order and finally bring me water after having to request it again. We got our food and aside from a manager checking on us as we both had our mouths full, nobody very stopped by our table again. We never received the check.....I had to ask for it after having waiting for far too long. I continued to see our original server not working the entire night. She was either flirting with a table of guys across from us or hugging and hanging out with a guy right in front of us at the bar. I understand these girls are young and working in a bar tends to include flirting.....but do your job. Make sure your guests are being taken care of. It was completely unprofessional and I won't be going back because it took over an hour to eat dinner when it should have only taken about 30 minutes. I almost didn't tip, but the server who ended up taking over most things was running around to other tables, so I didn't want to leave her nothing. She also wasn't attentive, but she at least helped us out some and was actually doing work related things. The good definitely isn't good enough to try and put up with such terrible service."}
{"text":"Service, food and drinks were top notch!!! Watched 2 games at once & very comfortably! Thank You!"}
{"text":"Understandably everyone has off nights and we experienced one of them. Calamity of errors thought the evening - slow service, order errors, cold food. Would consider this place more of a bar than a restaurant. Too many other good places in Tempe to waste a meal here. Skip this place."}
{"text":"Are you trying to rage your face off?!?!  Are you looking for ditsy woman with voluptuous figures to blow rape whistles vicariously throughout a fist pumping song?!?!  Did you ever think that Lord Disick would grace us with his presence at a sloshfest like this??  If so then get ready, because you're about to enter the place to rageface Fri/Sat nights & Sun mornings.  With music blast so loud you could hear it in the Grand Canyon, it's no wonder you'll look like a zombie the morning after because it's that wild.  The babes here at tops...I'd say if you go home w/ anything less than an 8 then you must of hit your head really hard on the side of the bar, got completely hammered or just have no game.  You want memories.  Go to El Hefe.  #BabesoftheBabes #NoCoverCharge #DanceFloorOnPoint #8'sAllAround"}
{"text":"We were here at 2pm on a Friday - the wait for outdoor table would have been 30-45 minutes so we took a seat at the bar.  We were served quickly and I enjoyed my Salty Chihuahua margarita (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/el-hefe-tempe?select=-k7Q8fXH1tRNndEyS8foAw#rfbhPZTZ4KMR8EUYtvVcZg) - not the best I've ever had, but it got the job done.  You definitely want to get the chili lime salt on the rim - so good.  The bloody mary was only ok - it was way too sweet for my taste (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/el-hefe-tempe?select=-k7Q8fXH1tRNndEyS8foAw#-k7Q8fXH1tRNndEyS8foAw).  A nice open layout but I'm guessing it gets packed later.  Good stop for a large drink on a weekday afternoon."}
{"text":"In town for a networking event and decided to stop by for lunch. It wasnt really crowded which was nice but the bartender was cool and prompt with our drinks/food. I ended up ordering the chips with guacamole which I thought was really good and the 3 taco lunch special with beef cheek, duck, and al pastor tacos and I was a fan of all three. Like I said, it wasnt packed so I cant relate with others that have had issues but I would def go back again."}
{"text":"El Hefe is a great addition to the already wild Mill Ave atmosphere!! I really enjoy the Margaritas and people watching on the front patio! The service is good, and the girls look good too! My friends and I go here a lot on the weekends, and sometimes to day drink!   It gets extremely busy on the weekends so you better WATCH OUT when paying with a card!! My boyfriend was double charged $79.00 when he told the server to split the tab with our friends (even though they both signed their receipts)! Beware and check those bank statements!!"}
{"text":"I came for the free guacamole. It almost made it worth the trip. The food is subpar. The place seems to be more of taco club with a Coyote Ugly vibe. The worst part about this place is the litany of photographs of the late-night patrons. The sheer number of gals and bros who send in Zoolanderesque poses without having a satirical flare is enough to give anyone a serious case of existential dread."}
{"text":"It was our first and last time eating/drinking here, definitely will not be coming back ever again. The hostess mean mugged us the second we walked in the door. We were sat in a booth that looked like the 70s puked on it that was covered in garbage and sticky. Everything we touched was sticky. The food was mush and no salt added at all. The menu says ingredients are fresh, but there's no way in hell. We both work in the food industry and that was just a slap in the face to claim the ingredients are fresh. Our bowls had hardly any meat in them. We got more meat hanging out of our waitresses shorts than in our bowls. The waitress was anything but attentive. Awful experience."}
{"text":"I have been here before and never had a problem, but I went last night and I was wearing pants that wear a little loose and they would not let me in. I am a big guy 6'3 and the dumb Chinese man said they were really baggy. He needs to open his eyes more. Lost a costumer. We were going to reserve three tables the following week for a huge party but they lost on that."}
{"text":"Loved the sign.. That's what made us stop in.  Food was delicious!!  We has the queso fundido, the Mexican fries and tacos.  Everything had perfect flavor combinations and was prepared beautifully.  And our server Kayla was attentive and super sweet!  Stop in and check them out!"}
{"text":"I came in to get some of these tacos I've heard about and one of the mamacita margaritas and I have to say it was delicious! The tacos were very unique and colorful, service was quick and very friendly, Kim who was our server was also great and I'll defenitly be back to try some more of the food and more margaritas! A fun restaurant with good food."}
{"text":"El Hefe is AMAZING specifically Eric the GM. He runs a tight ship. When you go to El Hefe you know you're getting the best service and a great atmosphere! Will be updating my review every time I receive excellent service"}
{"text":"Our server amber was amazing. She has such a sweet personality and gave us some great recommendations for the food. We will for sure come back here."}
{"text":"the food and ambiance was great.  Tacos are on the small side, so dont be afraid to order a bunch.  great food, great service, great location.  right down town by ASU campus  Cant wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"We tried the Hefe Dog, Hamburguesa, Chicken Taco and Carne Taco at Barrett Jackson. The food was great and the girls were awesome."}
{"text":"I visited this place last night, I decided to step over the fence from whiskey row,because I wanted to play cornhole,and the bouncer literally tackled me,and shoved my face to the pavement in the process. Meanwhile I stepped over the fence earlier on that night and nothing happened. This place has expensive drinks,horrible service, and bouncers that think they have a badge on. I will never step foot in this place again. If you want stiches, an expensive tab, and the rights of a slave this is the bar for you"}
{"text":"Great drinks, atmosphere, and probably the best Taco Tuesday on Mill Ave. A great value in an area where everything is a bit overpriced. Bring an appetite, their tacos are on the larger size. Just don't take the patio table my girl and I like to sit at"}
{"text":"Last night was a blast! All the servers were amazing, really friendly and attentive but not pushy.  Even the bathroom attendant was really nice! The bathroom was super clean as well.  Loved the Hornito's drinks! I really can't wait to go back. I've been wanting to try here for a couple months and I'm so glad I went last night! I really can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place  and come every Sunday with large group of people but lately the bouncers at the door  holds the  line for no reason. Last Sunday While the place was 1/3 full I had to wait in line for 30 minutes. However the door guy let about 50 people whom he didn't bother to check IDs because he knew them. This attitude needs to change and everyone should be respected. If we have to pay to get in the. Post a cover charge I would gladly pay that 5 or 10 dollar at the door than bribing your door guy. Last time I check bribing was against the law. Hire new door guys who is not associated with same douchy Scottsdale crowd so everyone get a chance to experience this place. Customer service starts at the door el Hefe management team not at the table. Till then I will take my money somewhere else..."}
{"text":"The pros...had the ceviche tostadas and a few tacos. All very good. If you are into the anorexic model in booty shorts and the unemployed skater look this is your place. The cons...the bar service is painfully slow and unfriendly. Overall feel is the front of house staff thinks they are far cooler than i think they are. A shame because the kitchen put out a good product."}
{"text":"My roommate and I were looking for a new place to try for dinner before a night out in Old Town.  We got to El Hefe at 8PM on a Saturday night.  We were quickly seated.  The music was so loud, we could hardly hear each other.  Typically a restaurant/bar doesn't bump up the music to that level until after 9 when more drinkers arrive.  We decided to try the Mexican Mule (being huge fans of the Moscow Mule).  We ordered chips and salsa as an appetizer.  I ordered the quesadilla for my meal and my roommate selected two carnitas tacos.  Our drinks arrived and the ginger beer in them was completely flat.  They were basically watered down tequila.  Undrinkable.  We asked if we could swap them out for something else.  The waitress complied.  As we waited for our replacement drinks, our main entrees came out.  Within 5 minutes, our chips and salsa arrived.  Another 10 minutes passed and finally our drinks arrived.  The delivery of the meal was a little backwards, but we were hungry.  The tacos were reported as \"really good.\"  My quesadilla consisted of three mini corn tortillas stuffed with some chicken and cheese and folded in half.  Not what I was expecting, but they were OK.  Someone described it as the new Pink Taco.  I would say it's a cross between Pink Taco and American Junkie.  Will definitely return for some afternoon day drinking."}
{"text":"Besides there being like 5 or 6 bouncers, people talking about getting cocaine in the line, and who knows what else in the bathrooms there, this place is due for a makeover"}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend, who is fromNYC and never been to the Southwest, to El Hefe as our first stop in PHX. It was a Sunday in December, so he was looking forward to watching the NY Jets game. So, I decided to take him here! I've never been here myself, so I thought why not? It's one of the newest places on Mill Ave since I left. It's definitely a good place to watch a game.   He had a couple beers and tacos. I had some margaritas and chips & salsa. First off, they have a long list of bomb margaritas! I can't remember the funky name of the one I got, but it was the one with Patron. It would have been great if the bartender was a little bit more generous with the Patron because I barely tasted any alcoholic content in this drink. I really do wish the bartenders and servers were more attentive though. The chips and salsa were great! The guacamole was mediocre. I had to ask for more chips 3x from 3 different people until I finally got my chip refill! Also, not once did the bartender ask if we wanted more to drink even when our glasses were empty.   The vibe around this place though was pretty awesome! The owner must be from Chicago or is a Chicago Bears fan because everyone seemed to be ecstatic and supportive of the team. They even had a DJ playing while all the games were on TV, and he was pretty damn good! Bravo to the DJ"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place, I'm new to the area and was told to check it out. I went to both locations Scottsdale, and Tempe on separate occasions and was not able to get in because of my sneakers? Where as other people with almost the same style of sneaker was able to get in? There is no sign posted about a dress code nor is there anything on the website that states that there is one. Why is there a dress code for certain style of sneaker and if so why is that not stated anywhere? If this is how all the establishment's are in either area I'll probably never be back."}
{"text":"Went in on a Friday evening after work with co-workers and received the absolute best customer service a big group could ask for. Happy Hour deals are amazing. Big margarita for just $5! Food was delicious. Elote Dip was bomb!!! Don't pass it up. Mr. Hottie Buff Manager on duty was incredibly nice and attentive to our table. This a great place to go after a long hard days work to unwind and make your belly happy."}
{"text":"DO NOT BUY BOTTLE SERVICE HERE.... We called ahead and reserved a table.  They told us the table was 1 bottle minimum .  We usually get 1 bottle of grey goose and then just order drinks and shots from our server (spending just as much as a bottle).    Server was pouring EXTRA drinks without putting mixer in them and leaving them on the side of the table. Then I noticed her take one of them away as if it was an empty.   Our server was also pouring very heavy, I don't usually mind and understand the server wants the bottle to finish quicker so we buy more.   Once the bottle ran out the server told us we needed to buy another one. We said we would rather just run up a tab and buy shots, mixed drinks, etc etc.  (there was 8 of us and we would have easily ran up more money than a bottle in the same time frame of drinking a bottle).    THE SERVER TOLD US TO GET OFF THE TABLE SINCE WE ARE NOT BUYING ANOTHER BOTTLE....  This has never happened at Revolver, Smashbox, Firehouse, Axis, or American Junkie.. We said we would be running up an equal amount, she said the only way she would allow us to stay is if each of us racked up a $200 tab.    Cliffs: Server was constanting pouring extra drinks and leaving them around our table. Server booted us from table for not buying another bottle even though we were willing to run up higher $$ tab."}
{"text":"Had an awesome experience with customer service the server and waitress were super prompt and friendly I was unsatisfied with my original order and the manager was very accommodating and followed up to make sure things turned out well and  sure enough it has!!!"}
{"text":"Really good chips and salsa. The tacos are also good  I order a margarita with a beer in it"}
{"text":"After a event we swung by to have a bite to eat and a couple brews. The place is trendy, younger crowd, and very clean. We found a couple stools at the bar and ordered chips and salsa and our first round. The bartender was very nice and quick to get us taken care of. The chips came out and for a \"mexican\" themed bar, pretty sad that the salsas were so bland. We got a menu and were gonna get some chow, but after seeing how much the tacos were we decided to wait and go somewhere else. We had a few more rounds, while this was happening the male friendly bartender left and 2 girls replaced him. The service quality quickly declined. They had attitudes, were slow. We left after I asked her for 2 shots of Jack Daniels Tennessee honey whiskey, and she held a bottle up and said \"this one\", I answered her stating \"no, the one right next to it\"... After that she got a bigger attitude and huffed at me. Yeah we called it a day."}
{"text":"Okay so this is your stereotypical Old Town Scottsdale night club.  One caveat....they shoot confetti into the sky from little guns.  Alright, I'm hooked.   It's over crowded. And I don't mean with just people in general.  I mean sweaty, overly intoxicated, overly \"friendly\" d's.    You have to expect that going into a place where you'll wait in line for 45min if you don't have breasts, right?  But again....the confetti.   They have chicks that dance on the bar running around with a whistle and a bottle of liquor pouring shots into whomever is brave enough to step up to the bar.  (This girl on her birthday! - no judgement needed.)  Note to self: this liquid they pour into your mouth taste more like battery acid rather than actual alcohol, but hey, it's the experience.  I have never even considered eating here being that I only force my friends into this establishment for special occasions.....or nights we've been over poured and feel like Superman.    On my birthday we ventured in here for 30min-1hr.  Enough time for a drink or two and a couple confetti showers. Heaven.  If you haven't been I recommend at least going once to really experience a real \"unce unce\" night in Old Town.  It will be everything you imagined.  That is if you imagine things such as: sticky floors, tight shirts on men, girls with tube socks on bars, overly gel'd - spiked hair, tight/short dresses, long lines (outside and inside), ear drum bursting bass and CONFETTI.   You're welcome."}
{"text":"Only giving one star because I have to. I do not make statements on racial issues, but tonight was very eye opening to me. A group of us (mixed races) flew in from SF for the weekend. We tried to get into this bar and were refused for the one guy that had a \"white\" t-shirt (he's black). I would not have a problem with this if it was a general rule that was applied to everyone. But from the entrance, we could see several men with white shirts on. When asked about it, we were told we needed to pay $800 for a table to be allowed in like them. Being me, I went to the side of the bar and asked a random man in a white shirt standing on the side if he had paid $800 for a table.... He laughed and asked what I was talking about. And then I had a security guard (from that same bar) tell me that what I thought I saw was correct and he saw it every night, but he didn't own the place so there was nothing he could do...  This is not a place I would want to spend my money anyways. Just felt the need to share because I believe of you don't, your just part of the problem."}
{"text":"Club atmosphere could be great. Except when I had a table for my graduation I wasn't even allowed in because I was late but half my party was already there. Apparently all the tables were filled to capacity? Bulls$!?$. It's the fact that they let other people in who weren't in line too. Thanks El Hefe."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. The line is always backed up, and it's full scum bags. Drinks are super pricy, and extremely tiny. You can't hear a damn word anyone is saying, and you always have someone's sweat rubbing off on you. This bar is over crowded, and way too noisy. Oh and if you have to use the restroom, plan on waiting in like for almost 10 minutes. Can't stand El Hefe."}
{"text":"Just stopped by for quick lunch. the carne asada fries are a must!! Really fun atmosphere and friendly staff"}
{"text":"Tonight i went to El hefe for tacos. That turned into me using the bathroom. Which turned into me using the air hand dryer and having to touch the bathroom door handle in order to exit. I attempted to speak with the general manager to at least ask for paper towel to be put in the ladies restroom. The security guard then decided to butt in and say \"theres toilet paper, cant you use that?\" I emphasized that that isn't the point.   The general manager not only ignored my request but also rolled his eyes as if what i was requesting was going to come out of his paycheck. I have eaten and patronized EL Hefe several times. But i probably wont be back."}
{"text":"El Hefe is awesome!   The tacos are brilliant! Try the Chicken Tinga tacos and wash it down with the Carlos Estavez Margarita; It has strawberries and jalapeno! YUM!  Right in the heart of Old Town's entertainment district, its always a party here! The staff is outstanding, and the music is by far the best, if your into house and hip hop!  Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"I will never go back here again! Went here to celebrate my birthday, they refused to let one of our guests in stating his out of state license was a fake- with no proof and couldn't give us any explanation. The bouncer was rude and our guest had to go to back to our hotel to get his passport which clearly states the same information and come back to Old Town Scottsdale. I say stay clear it's not worth the hassle.   The staff is on a HUGE power trip!"}
{"text":"This bar is okay, I came in on Sunday to enjoy \"Sunday funday\" and right at the door I was asked where I was coming from because I was \"stumbling\". I actually just walk a little off because I recently had ankle surgery, but thanks to the security guard for pointing that out.  The place I was coming from was a hotel so that was a little awkward.   The service of the waitresses is okay, it got pretty busy. I hope the bartenders get paid well because they were moving to try to accommodate all the orders coming in."}
{"text":"This place is like the Mexican Hooters. Great food and drinks. The staff gave pretty good service. I love the little metal mugs they have for certain drinks. The atmosphere is kind of western saloon like minus the whores and rooms. Hahaha. I would definitely come here again. :)"}
{"text":"Ordered chips and salsa, took 3 years to get it. They can't handle basic service items."}
{"text":"If I have to choose a Hefe, I prefer the one in Scottsdale but I think there are better places to be than Hefe in Scottsdale and in Tempe. They're both crazy packed. The line is usually pretty long Thursday-Saturday and you're going to be rubbing a lot of shoulders and other body parts against people when you try and move around. Be prepared. If you don't like being close to people and you're not assertive, you're never getting anywhere in there. It's generally a very drunk, sort of trashy young crowd but what else are you on Mill for anyways? El Hefe is the classic college club crowd and it needs to be experienced by everyone at least once in their life, but it's definitely not my first choice. Also lots of people try to jump the patio fence while they're waiting in line...Don't."}
{"text":"Food is excellent.  We had fajitas, chicken Caesar salad, tacos, chips and theit fabulous guacole The location is very open and breezy.  Next time I'll skip the margaritas unless its happy hour.  They are definitely not worth  $10. Service was a little lacking after we said no to seconds on the margaritas.  Waters we empty for 20 minutes and my   daughter had to request a box 3 times."}
