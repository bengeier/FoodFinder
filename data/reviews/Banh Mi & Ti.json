{"text":"Outstanding customer service. The staff is extremely friendly and outgoing.  The food is exceptional. I had the drunken beef and it was delicious. The Vietnamese iced coffee is also the best I've ever had.  The only downside is the small space. There is not a ton of room to dine in, especially when it's very busy. However don't let this dissuade you from going! Totally worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent bahn mi and the coffee was to die for! We had one bahn mi with chicken and one with pork belly. The flavor was great with both, but I preferred the chicken, as the pork was a bit too fatty for my taste. You can tell they're still getting some minor kinks worked out (e.g., serving condiments alongside sandwiches) and it could benefit from a bit more seating. But the staff was warm and friendly and the food was excellent. Will return!"}
{"text":"Small menu which I like. They can focus on what's good. We got 4 different types of flavor.  2 with bread and 2 with rice. All four items were decent.  The seating arrangement at this is less to be desire. The plastic silverware were flimsy. Overall I would come back here but probably just take out."}
{"text":"Pro-Tip: park far away and close your eyes!  You'll thank me later  Tony from meat loves the pok pok and I wouldn't say no. But I said 'hey tony, what's with all the carrots?'  You would've thought I stepped on his kid's turtle. Definitely don't mention his wife. Can't wait to try this place when I get the time."}
{"text":"Just what I was hoping for. Fresh, vibrant flavors. Tasty meats. I had the maple pork - spot on. The bread is crunchy yet soft. Nice, quick service. They could use more seating, but otherwise this is perfect if you're looking for banh mi."}
{"text":"Stopped into Banh Mi & Ti today for lunch and had an excellent experience! The owner was charming and gave me a full run down of the menu and what each Vietnamese dish is and tastes like. I have never had a Vietnamese meal before until today but I will definitely be back. Highly recommend stopping by if you're in the Pittsburgh area!"}
{"text":"I tried this place the other day for take out while walking past the store. The staff there was so friendly and fun. They took their time to explain things on the menu and give me their recommendations. It was fast service. I had the drunken beef with the mayo and it was delicious. The crisp carrots and cucumbers make it so refreshing. I can't wait to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Finally a great place in Pittsburgh to get Bahn Mi! And at a great price range, too! Went with a group of people and got pretty much one of everything on the menu and we were all not disappointed. Didn't get any coffee drinks but there's always next time."}
{"text":"Celebrated my grandsons 17th birthday with Bubble tea and delicious rice bowl! Food was fresh and delicious and the service kind and friendly. The restaurant had a small seating area that was neat and clean. Definitely would stop back!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Had the classic chick and pork'n'roll. Both very delicious and just the right amount of heat/sriracha. Limited, but cozy seating.  Variety of different flavored bubble teas with a mix of toppings.  Definitely a new favorite spot. Not very many places around Pittsburgh have decent Vietnamese sandwiches."}
{"text":"All food is fresh and creatively crafted.  The bubble teas are like sweet injections of oxygen.  The service is like visiting friends that happen to have  the coolest spot in town."}
{"text":"everyone is always so friendly and welcoming here! the banh mi and rice bowls and bubble tea are incredible -- it's my new fav spot!"}
{"text":"Just got a chance to stop in here today and was not disappointed! The bread was delightfully crusty, the maple pork succulent and not too sweet, the pickled carrots crisp. I'll definitely be back to try the bubble teas next. Stop in when you have the chance!"}
{"text":"Banh Mi Ti is amazing!  The staff are super helpful and have great suggestions on local favorites. The hot green milk bubble tea with red beans was incredible!  Definitely a great place to hide from the cold and enjoy a great time. Only drawback is limited seating."}
{"text":"Great food friendly staff. It was our first time there for a quick lunch. We had a bang mi, beef stew, and mango bubble tea. Everything was delicious. There were at least 7 people working behind the counter at the same time on Saturday afternoon. Some of them would walk back in the back room to get more ingredients. That makes the service really fast. There is some space in front of the restaurant. I hope they put out some tables and chairs soon so we could sit outside in a nice day.  We will go back and bring friends!"}
{"text":"Really stellar. Sandwich and tea both delicious. Had the roasted pork bahn mi and hot mango milk tea."}
{"text":"Bahn mi is not bad, slightly better than average. However, a couple factors bring down the score.  The wait was long on the two occasions we have been, on weekday evening and Saturday afternoon both. Longer wait than should be expected, ordering is done at the counter.  Viet iced coffee was good, though a bit sweet and far too much ice to warrant the cost. The plastic cup is completely full of ice before liquid is added.  Seating was a bit sparse, though I don't dock eateries for this. It adds to the charm.  The prices are high for Bahn mi, there is no way around it. $8 is more than I've ever paid, and for the overall experience it just didn't make up for the high price."}
{"text":"Wow. Super good sandwich. I got the Viet Special with the jalepeno and siracha. The spiciness level was not too hot, enough to be pleasant, but I like spicy. Everything inside was very flavorful and balanced. The baguette was crispy, but not enough to cut your mouth. The side cabbage salad is a nice little add-on, assuming you like fish sauce. Price for everything is very fair. Not enormous, but a solid meal. My only regret is that I have but one stomach to fill. I can't wait to eat there again."}
{"text":"I'm so glad my friend introduced me to this hidden gem. Since my first visit with her, I've come back several times and each time I am greeted with smiles and friendly personas. The people there work efficiently but are never unfriendly or rush you. Like many others, I fell in love with the viet special the first time I got it and have been craving and returning for it since. I recommend opting for the Sriracha sauce and jalapeños for the added flavor and texture that complement the sandwich oh so well. However, the xa xiu and tofu sandwiches deserve honorable mentions as well. My only complaint is that the portion sizes are too small; I'm guilty of having ordered a second sandwich to bring home with me to eat. Other than that, I can't wait to venture to banh mi & ti again!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Not a Banh Mi expert but everything was fresh and well flavored. The owners were exceptionally friendly and welcoming. Perfect cafe atmosphere. Don't think twice. Simple, fresh, easy food."}
{"text":"Excellent service and outstanding banh mi. High recommend the pork n roll and beef options. Will be going back for some bubble tea and Vietnamese coffee."}
{"text":"The people are nice, but I like more than unflavored white rice with cold tomatoes, cold cucumbers and shredded carrots in a bowl. The little bit of tofu did not have any flavor.  I left hungry and unsatisfied after eating the very small portion of tofu and cucumbers and tomatoes.  Gave a 3 because everyone who works there are friendly and they are just starting out and because I heard good comments about the buns they use for their sandwiches."}
{"text":"After reading such great reviews, my wife and I decided to make the drive from the north hills to Lawrenceville for date night.  We were not disappointed.  The staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  We shared an order of shrimp summer rolls, a drunken beef banh mi and a pork banh mi..  Everything was fresh and delicious.  And the prices were quite reasonable.   We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It fills a great niche for a Lawrenceville restaurant- great food, fairly fast service, casual and very clean atmosphere, good prices. It's great for a lunch or a casual dinner or take-out. The owners are sisters and are just as nice as can be. I highly recommend the drunken beef sandwich- tasy and fresh and not too heavy. I don't like boba but have had several of the drinks without add-ons and quite like them. The kumquat is surprisingly good. Great addition to the neighborhood and I love having them around."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are really cool for a change of pace.  The only drawbacks are that it takes a while between ordering and receiving the sandwich, and the seating is very limited, so there can be some standing around while waiting for a table.  The service is super friendly, and the bread is great, and that's the most important part of any sandwich."}
{"text":"We needed this place in Pittsburgh! Delicious and fresh. Bubble tea made with real tea and not so sweet. I highly recommend this place for all your Bahn Mi needs!"}
{"text":"First off, the staff are lovely- they greeted me when I came in, and seem very genuine. My xa xiu roll just came out and its hands down one of the best sandwiches I've eaten in the city- perfect mix of sweet, spicy and crunchy. Everything on my sandwich- cilantro, jalapeños, bread, vegetables, meat- is fresh. I got the almond green tea and unlike bubble tea I've gotten in Oakland it's not sickly sweet, which is a plus. Decor is clean and airy, great place for a solo lunch or a date (prices are very reasonable for the service and how much you get.) My only complaint is I live a few blocks away and would really like to not spend all my money here in the future. Definitely one of my new favorites in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Excellent!  This is a small shop with a limited menu, but you should definitely try it out!  Everything was delicious.  The staff were all super friendly and the service was fast.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Great service, food, options and pricing. If this place was closer to me they'd see me everyday for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is a favorite for my wife and I.  We will go at least once a week.  They have a large selection of banh mi and bubble tea so you can surely find something you like.  My favorite is the drunken beef and taro bubble tea.  If you're in need of a pick-me-up their Vietnamese coffee will hit the spot."}
{"text":"This place is an excellent addition to the lawrenceville food scene. If you're not familiar with Banh Mi or Bubble Tea have no fear the friendly staff will help you navigate the menu.  I've been here a few times already and tried the sandwiches and bowls and as far as I can tell you really can't go wrong.    The restaurant itself is a nice little space offering a dine in option or an easy takeaway if you're on the go."}
{"text":"A great locally owned place. The drunken beef is the best. Sandwiches are a bit small, so if your really hungry you could probably eat two."}
{"text":"Visiting Pittsburgh from AZ and popped in because of reviews and don't have good Banh Mi near our home- absolutely delicious. Ordered 2 different sandwiches and a rice bowl and all were exceptional.  Have a feeling anything off the menu would be good!!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Their sandwiches are fresh, tasty, and refreshing.  Enough options to keep you coming back.   Unlike many bahn mi sandwiches in town, these sandwiches have a good portion of meat inside and are really filling.  The spring rolls are huge and fresh--big pieces of shrimp with herbs and noodles, I would put these up as some of the best in town.    They sometimes have housemade non-alcoholic drinks, like strawberry limeaid.  That's what they  had when I was there last, and it was wonderful.    The patio is nice and sunny, a great place to sit and enjoy a sandwich and iced tea.  Everyone that works here is also very nice and helpful.    A+"}
{"text":"These guys are knocking it out of the park! Best bahn mi in Pittsburgh! Friendly folks, nice space, and great food and drink! làm tt"}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, and tasty!  Bright, clean, and inviting interior.  Very friendly staff.  Staff recommended the Viet Special as the most popular and most traditional option.  We opted for a drunken beef as well.  Both were fantastic."}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighborhood. The prices are good, the food is good, the atmosphere is pleasant, and the owner even came over and talked to us asking what we thought. Surly something must be wrong. Well haven't found it yet. Everything is freshly made and can't wait to work my way through the limitless tea menu."}
{"text":"Really disappointing banh mi's at this place. Especially given that their prices aren't super cheap. The service was alright. But I wouldn't go back. The food's just not that great and it's not a comfortable place to enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"The service is very friendly and their Banh Mi is authentic. Could have more pickled cabbage and carrot though. Best Banh My in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"When Lucy isn't in town (for those in Pittsburgh, this makes sense), it's hard to find a good Banh Mi sandwich. I've tried making my own at home but can't come close. We were finally able stop here on a Saturday afternoon.  My wife and I decided to split a Classic Chick and a Xa Xiu. We had to wait about 10 minutes in line, which is a little difficult in the winter as everyone crams inside. The cashier was very pleasant talking through the options with all the guests including descriptions of the sandwiches and bubble tea drinks.  The sandwiches were both fantastic (make sure to ask for extra jalepenos). Better than Lucy's? Hard to say. But still 5 star worthy in my book."}
{"text":"I WANTED MORE VINEGAR!  Went to try out because I gotta admit the lame clothing shop that use to be housed at this store front just had to go! I love Banh Mi but mostly for the salty sweet pickled cucumbers and carrots balancing the richness of meats and crisp french bread. It had all the makings of goodness but really lacked on flavors bringing it all together.   See You Around Larryville Kids!"}
{"text":"Coming from California where there is a great Asian food scene, I initially settled for mediocre Asian food or just stayed away from going out to eat Asian food in Pittsburgh at all. So finding Bahn Mi & Ti was such a nice blessing. I got the Bo Kho Bowl, and my friend got the Drunken Beef Bowl because we were both feeling rice for dinner. For the price point they were at, this definitely satisfied my expectations.  My Bo Kho Bowl came with two separate items: the rice with the marinated carrot and tomato slices on top, and the soup based beef with carrots. The beef was so tender, it easily fell apart. It was well marinated, so it tasted yummy too. The soup was flavorful, but not overpowering or too salty, and it mixed really well with the rice and vegetables!  I tried my friend's drunken beef bowl, and the meat was also very tender after being marinated in white wine! The flavor is nice, and I would choose to get that as well in the future when I'm feeling for a dry dish."}
{"text":"Wow! Simple,yet delicious. Do your mouth a favor and pop in for a quick bite. We tried 4 different dishes and found them all to be delightful and refreshing. Staff was pleasant and answered any questions we had. We'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  We had the Classy Chick & the Vietnam Special w the Onion Soup.  Out of this World delicious.  Service & staff are delightful & pleasant."}
{"text":"So happy to find bub tea in Pitt!! Coming from LA, it is a welcome sight. Chicken banh mi was perfect."}
{"text":"Awesome place in Lawrenceville for Vietnamese sandwiches.  I stop by here all the time if I'm in the area and craving banh mi(which is always).  I've really only tried the Viet special so I can't speak on their other items but it's one of the more authentic ones in Pittsburgh. The Vietnamese iced coffee is also a perfect complement to the sandwich.  Special vietnamese sandwich: 9/10 Viet coffee: 9/10"}
{"text":"Loved this place.  We had a wonderful no-frills bahn mi shop in Portland, ME, that I miss terribly (you know, only cash, knew what you wanted because you were a regular--didn't even need to ask).  This place one-upped it on friendliness.  The staff was amazing and very kind with suggestions.  We got the Lemongrass Chicken and Maple pulled Pork sandwiches (names have escaped me).  They were topped with pickled veggies and fresh cilantro, and I would have happily had those doubled.  The pork was a little tough to chew, but my MIL and husband enjoyed the Chix. We also got boba tea, I had mango and husband had strawberry. The bobas were a little overcooked and stuck to each other in the bottom. A stray one may have nearly killed my husband by choking (we have life insurance policy, so no worries).  The store is located in the now-bustling Lawrenceville and opened late-morning on a weekday.  The inside is narrow, but expands to some seating in the back, up a few stairs.  We sat on stools at the counter while we awaited our order.  It was clean, more modern/contemporary decor, and menu easy to read behind the counter.  Service was amazing and I hope that stays!  I haven't tried other places in Pittsburgh, and if none compare, I'll happily return and review accordingly.   But, certainly, I recommend you stop in.  At least get a boba tea."}
{"text":"So GOOD! I crave the original Viet Special every week. For 8 bucks a sandwich, you get a huge sandwich stuffed with pickled veggies, the vietnamese deli meat, cilantro, and jalapenos. Nothing to complain. Great service, friendly, and fast. Great bubble tea and viet coffee. Wish you opened later to fulfill my late, drunk hunger.... So glad you guys are here :)"}
{"text":"Extremely upset by how overcharged this place is. The sugar cane juice is $5 and when I asked for no ice I was told that would be $2 extra. I asked if I could just get less ice but that was also $1 extra. Unbelievable!! The cups are already pretty small to begin with. We watched them make the sugar cane juices and saw in dismay as they filled up the cups COMPLETELY with ice before adding the juice. They also only put the sugar cane through the grinder once. I asked why and was told that if you put the sugar cane multiple times through the grinder, the pulp will come out too. However I've seen multiple other establishments do this and get so much more juice. My recommendation is for this place to either get a better machine or use a filter after grinding the sugar cane. $5 for HALF a cup of sugar can juice is RIDICULOUS. Please refer to my photos for evidence on the cup of juice and then how much was left when I took out all the ice. The only reason I'm not giving this place 1 star is because my friends got the Bahn Mi which I tasted and it was pretty good. 0/10 would not recommend this place for the sugar cane juice. In fact, would not recommend this place for the Vietnamese coffee either. My friend bought it last time and same issue happened with her. So disappointed in this place.  If you want to pay $5 for a cup of ice, this is your place."}
{"text":"Believe the hype. While I can't comfortably make claims about the authenticity of the food, in this case it matters very little.  The food and service here are absolutely worth the effort of trying to find parking in Lawrenceville.  For a Bahn Mi newbie, the Viet Special is the way to go.  I typically add jalapeños and Siracha, but I'd go naked for your first try.   My favorite thing on the menu, odd though this may sound, is the cafe phin--coffee brought in from New Orleans with sweetened, condensed milk.  I've come here several times just for the coffee.    The places is clean, though the indoor seating is unimpressive.  If you can, grab a seat outside for some prime Lawrenceville hipster-watching."}
{"text":"Second time coming and it couldn't have been better! Ordered the Xa Xiu this time - which contained a greasier pork I guess you could say - but still just as delicious as the pork n roll. We came at a pretty busy time where the line was out the door. But they're service is fast and efficient! And the workers are amazingly welcoming and friendly"}
{"text":"I met up with a couple of friends to try this place, none of us had been here yet.  The interior is pretty small with only a few tables.  There is outdoor seating available as well.  You order at the counter and the food is brought out to you.  I ordered the Drunken Beef Rice Bowl and a Peach Black Tea with Strawberry Popping Boba.  The menu is small, but the quality and value is good.  The beef was tender and slightly sweet.  I would definately order it again.  Both of my friends had the chicken and both were very happy with their choice.  I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I've had this place book marked since it first opened because I LOVE BANH MI so much and Pittsburgh is pretty limited in in Vietnamese cuisine options. The only thing is that it's a little far from Pitt's campus by bus so I really only had the chance to go because someone with a car took me yesterday. When I say that I was smiling the entire time I was there, I'm not lying.   What struck me as soon as we entered the restaurant was the lights hanging from the ceiling and the overall feeling of coziness of the place. It's a little small so seating is limited, but I found that I liked it that way. You order when you first walk in at the counter and then sit down and the sandwiches are brought to you by one of the workers. I had the chance to chat with the owner who one of the few women owners of a small business in Pittsburgh (#represent) and she was so friendly!!   I ended up ordering the Pork N'Roll which was the perfect amount of sweetness to go along with the sourness of the pickled vegetables and the spiciness of the Sriracha. I asked for extra cilantro and was so happy to find that they really honored my request. The option to get jalapenos in your sandwhich (or on the side) is also available. The warm butter that was spread onto the bread I found was what really pulled everything together and it was DE-LI-CIOUS.   I've tried ineffable cafe as well and really found that this place left me so much more satisfied. I was so hungry that I didn't have time to take a picture but will definitively be returning in the future to try everything else on the menu including the bubble tea which I hear is bomb. Such a great little find in Lawrenceville. Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Never really had bahn mi before I went to this place, so I can't really compare it to others.   Extremely clean, wait wasn't do bad. Bread was fresh, as were the jalapeños on my sandwich.  I have had summer rolls before, and theirs are great too. All the veggies are very fresh.  All in all very tasty.    This might have become a regular place for me, but alas, I'm only here on business."}
{"text":"It was definitely worth the trip and the bread for the sandwiches was fantastic. The prices were very reasonable and it's a quaint little spot to grab a bite. If you like bánh mì do yourself a favor and stop here"}
{"text":"What stands out to me most is the exceptional customer service and extremely friendly staff, but  of course I can't forget about the delicious banh mi, which was exactly what Pittsburgh was missing! It's about time we got a brick and mortar specializing in the (oh-so special and dear to me) Vietnamese sandwich. I love that they have several options too, not just one choice. Each sandwich was carefully crafted to incorporate the authentic, traditional flavors with their own special twist. We got the Viet Special and the Pork 'n Roll. Both were amazing and had a crazy array of flavors and textures in each bite. Just FYI, the Viet Special is more of a cold cut sandwich.   To make the place even more special to me, Banh Mi & Ti also has fabulous bubble tea. Their bubble tea is a step above all the rest because unlike most other places, their tea base is actual tea and not a powder mix. Because of this, you can choose your base: black, green, or oolong. They also don't overload on the sugar, but of course can tailor to your preferences. That's another benefit of not using a pre-made powder!  I cannot wait to come back and to tell all my friends about this cute sandwich and coffee/tea shop!"}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations. First, the staff here are very nice. I felt welcomed as soon as I walked in the door. I ordered the summer rolls for an appetizer and had the pork 'n' roll bowl as my entree. It was very filling, the side of tomato and cucumber went well with the pork and rice bowl. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I love bahn mi. I love bubble tea. I LOVE bahn mi and ti!  My fiance seriously suggests we eat here at least 2 times a week. I don't want to over do it and get sick of it so I'm usually a soft no on eating Bahn Mi more than once to twice in a month. I always get the Pork and Roll and fiance switches it up all the time. I know I know everyone says it but it's so true: THE STAFF IS AMAZING!!!!!!! They are friendly and helpful and patient. This place gets BUSY but it is so worth the wait, trust me. I can't wait to pop in a get a bubble tea this week or even a sandwich. I've only had their sandwiches but their rice bowls look awesome!!! Don't be afraid to ask about something you don't understand or are  curious about.  I recommend getting your pork and roll spicy with fresh jalapenos and sriracha on it! It's not overwhelming and is the perfect balance of sweet and spice."}
{"text":"Their food is really great! Full of amazing flavor and the tea and coffee is excellent too! Everything on the menu is yummy but go for a sandwich ! The women working here are the kindest ladies ever. They are literally so sweet. I'm happy they are here!"}
{"text":"I've had plenty of banh mi's before and was never disappointed before. My friends have raved good things about this place, and I had my speculations.. I believe that it's pretty hard to make a bad banh mi.  We were greeted upon entering and the workers were very friendly. I ordered the Viet Special ($7.25), keeping it to the classic banh mi with pork roll, cured pork, and head cheese.  The ingredients were delicious and fresh! Their bread was just crispy enough too. If you like spicy, I recommend getting the sriracha and jalapenos in it.   My only complaint would be their Vietnamese coffee or sugar cane, it seems they really skimp out on the liquid part because your cup is majority ice for $4.50 or $4.95.  My first visit here was actually their special Bun Bo Hue Night on 5/17, which was super yummy and satisfied my craving. Hope they have another special night like that again :)!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy this place exists. The Viet special was very satisfying and the bubble tea is not overly sweet because they don't add additional sweetener. The staff is so friendly, kept addressing me by name. This is a new favorite and I'm a huge fan."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, but I was really into the drinks. My girlfriend got Lavender Boba, and I got a coffee. Both were delicious."}
{"text":"My lovely husband brought me home Bahn Mi & Ti the day after I finished the whole 30. I'm not sure if it was the drastic change from my super restrictive diet, or what, but I am IN LOVE with Bahn Mi & Ti. I have only had one Bahn Mi that I liked more and that was at a little place in DC. I got the veggie Bahn Mi, which was amazing, but next time I think I might want to try tofu, just for some more texture/filler. I also had a rice bowl that surprised me with how good it was!   I can't wait to come back and try other things!!! Great place!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The bahn mi are always fresh and the wait (except when it's very busy) is pretty short. Even when I go at weird hours they have fresh ingredients and jump right into it. The Viet Special may be my favorite, but I like ordering something different every time I go in since there are enough options to keep things interesting. My only minor complaint would be price, however I do happily pay it given the quality and experience.  The proprietors are lovely people who care about their food and their business. By the third time I came in Kelly had already learned my name and now greets me when I walk in. It felt like a neighborhood joint the first week it opened and now regularly gathers a big line during the weekend. It is worth the wait."}
{"text":"I went back several times now and still love it.  I got the Xa Xiu sandwich, the bo kho (beef stew) bowl, the bo kho sandwich, summer roll, and another flavor tea.  The Xa Xiu sandwich is one of my favorite.  The pork in it is great and cooked well.  The bo kho bowl  was very filling and portion great.  My favorite so far is the bo kho sandwich.  It comes with the stew and a naked sandwich.  The stew tastes great and is well done.  Paired with the sandwich, I feel like I am eating a meal my grandma made me.  Their flavored tea has been great as well.  Except the boba has been inconsistent.  First time I had it, boba was well cooked but bland.  Second and third time I had it it taste great but wasn't cooked well.  Still a work in progress.  Their summer roll is basically just their version with spring roll.  Their sauce taste great and it was also well made.  Customer service is also still exceptional.  Recommendations, if you're looking to try a sandwich, The Viet Special is still the one to try.  It's the cheese steak of the Vietnamese people. Majority of Vietnamese banh mi shops will have this sandwich.  If you want something with more familiar ingredients, try the Xa Xiu.  And if you want something comforting on a cold, rainy day, the bo kho sandwich/bowl is the way to go.  Add jalapeno to everything.  It's cut very thinly so it adds a nice subtle heat to your meal but doesn't burn.  If you want legitimate Vietnamese coffee, this place got it.  Overall, this place is fantastic and a must try."}
{"text":"First time here. Viet special was very good had it with jalapeños. Spring shrimp rolls also tasty. Around 15 people in small place at 12:35 for lunch. Would recommend coming right at noon or after 1:00 to miss crowd. Will be back."}
{"text":"The Beef Rice Bowl is a must!  Walked in on a whim....great service, friendly staff.  I am a fan!"}
{"text":"One of my partners and I came here for dinner. I usually get pho when I crave Vietnamese, so it was fun to go someplace that specializes in Banh Mi!    We got the Special w/ head cheese and the drunken beef. The drunken beef was the flavorful star of the show!  I kept stealing bites of it because it was so good and gingery.   We also got an oolong milk boba tea. It was tasty, but could have had more bubbles and less ice!   The ambience felt a little weird. I didn't like that you could see right into the trash, and the trash and recycling bring so visible made it feel kind of messy and gross.   When my partner and I sat in the seating area that is a little upstairs, there were fruit flies bothering us!  There was also some child that the owners were watching that kept shouting about poo and using the bathroom?  Kinda turned me off to have that happening next to me trying to eat their tasty Banh mi."}
{"text":"mmmmm yes, as good as it gets, a small joint but wow, super friendly peeps behind the counter, everyone said HI as we walked in the door... everything is made fresh to order, even the tea is brewed fresh daily, we actually got our sammies before our tea!  we sampled the Viet Special and the Chicken... both really tasty, will definitely be back for more..."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and wonderful people! This is the best place around! Everything is delicious (and I think at this point I've had everything)."}
{"text":"This is a lovely little lunch place. I had the Classy Chick Bowl. The flavors were fresh and I was able to try something \"new\" without venturing too far out there. I also ordered black strawberry bubble tea but they were out of classic boba (which was disappointing as I was looking forward to it) so I got the popping bubbles instead. It was good, it just wasn't what I wanted.   That being said, the prices were super reasonable, service was good, and food was tasty. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This is a nice little spot on Butler that has a nice outdoor sitting area. The food is light and fresh and very flavorful. Their sandwiches are good and the milk tea is delicious."}
{"text":"This was my first time here.... a true delight!!!  The service was wonderful, they explained the dishes and I will be back!!  Had the tofu Bahn and will visit again soon!!!"}
{"text":"This is hands down, our favorite Vietnamese sandwich shop. With plenty of vegetarian and vegan options, Bahn Mi and Ti's menu is sure to please the whole crowd because let's be honest, who doesn't love perfectly flaky French bread, loads of veggies and herbs and filling washed down with bubble milk tea? They also offer Vietnamese noodle salads and summer rolls too. Yum."}
{"text":"Banh Mi & Ti is my absolute favorite restaurant in Lawrenceville. The banh mi sandwiches are addicting and the bubble tea and Vietnamese coffee are fantastic.   The owners are so welcoming and lovely. My fiance actually left his wallet there and they hand delivered it to our house after the restaurant closed for the evening. You honestly can't get better service than that!  The restaurant itself is clean and bright and their patio is dog-friendly, which is always a huge plus.  In terms of food, I am obsessed with the Pork'n Roll and could eat it every day. HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, really inviting setting, supper nice staff, easy to understand menu, perfect amount of choices and a place I will visit over and over! Please support this women owned business well worth it! Sooo affordable, fresh and delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Very pleased. Love the beef stew with sriracha. Especially love the peach bubble tea and iced coffee. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"the friendliest small restaurant owner you'll see in pittsburgh. A lot of people go for the viet special as a safe choice, but go for the Xa Xiu if you really want flavors!"}
{"text":"Have visited multiple times since it's opened. I love their Viet Special so much! I've strayed to try the Pork N' Roll and the Xa Xiu, but always come back to the Viet Special. First of all, their baguettes are hard and crunchy on the outside, which is amazing. The Viet Special in particular has some very flavorful and mouthwatering ingredients like the pate and head cheese which go so well together.  In terms of drinks, I've tried the Viet iced coffee and a pretty basic bubble tea. Their iced coffee is pretty good, but if you're ordering it definitely be aware that most of the cup is filled with ice. I usually just drink the free water they have in the store when I go."}
{"text":"Banh MI and Ti is a great little spot for Coffee and Tea drinks, dining  and people watching in Lawrenceville. Lovely patio dining. Enjoyable bubble teas and coffees along with the delicious fare. The flavors were delicious in the food items we tried. We will definitely be back to continue to explore the menu. Great woman owned business to visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Really loved the drunken beef sandwich! My husband also loved his chicken sandwich and strawberry milk tea. Great lunch spot!"}
{"text":"i am a fan of this place. The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly.   The sandwiches are not as quickly put together as Jimmy Johns but they are a fairly quick in and out stop.  The portions could be larger as well. There is a big of bread to meat/other fillings ratio.  The drunken beef is amazing and my favorite sandwich. The pork sandwich CIA Xin and the Viet special are good, not great.   We had the taro milk tea. It was very delicious but the size was too small for the price.  We will be back."}
{"text":"When I went here the food was pretty good. It was a bad decision for us to order a sandwich with head-cheese. That was about as appetizing as it sounds. As far as finding foreign food in Pittsburgh, it can be really extremely tough. This food is definitely good and tastes way better than the typical foreign food in Pittsburgh.  I would definitely recommend checking it out sometime if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Tried the Drunken Beef bowl and it was fantastic. Taste of meat was really interesting and the spicy jalapeños and veggies made it all the yummier. Staff still remembers me from two months ago ... that is most impressive. Friendly, kind, and kindred."}
{"text":"Fabulous bank mi, wonderful owners. Outstanding place to drop in for lunch.  Great food and atmosphere"}
{"text":"Stupid Good. Hit the spot on a rainy winter day.  Bo Kho - superb especially paired with the super crisp but soft in the middle baguette  Cafe Phin - jolt of black coffee with chicory and the sweetness from the condensed milk"}
{"text":"Finally made our way down to this super popular sandwich place. The parking can be hard. They were super busy for Saturday lunch. We got the drunken beef and Xia xiu sandwich. If they don't identify themselves Vietnamese sandwich, I wouldn't be able to tell what region is it. My favorite out of two was the drunken beef. The beef was very well flavored and cooked. The pickled carrots and cucumber were the prefect adds on for the crunchiness.  But it tasted like Korean Bogogi. The Xia Xiu is a pork sandwich, I think it is essentially the canteens cha xu. Overall, it was good choice. I think I will go back to try more. Not sure if you can call in to order take out to save some waiting time, but at the time of writing this review, I didn't see the menu on their website. Maybe will check with them on our next attempt."}
{"text":"Came in for their family and friends opening and was able to try the Viet Special sandwich and the Classy chick bowl. I was so excited for this place to open, I miss having bahn mi close to home. The bread was very good - crunchy on the outside and soft inside - and the meat toppings were delicious! Definitely a well made, classic combo bahn mi ($7.25). I tried a bite of the chicken and it was well flavored. If you're deciding between a sandwich and a bowl, go for the bread, it's more filling.   They also have boba with various toppings and flavors, and Vietnamese coffee. I'm very excited to welcome this place to lawrenceville, I think it will be a great place for a casual meal and seems to be reasonably priced for the area.   I am going back soon to try the beef stew, one of my favorite Vietnamese dishes!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my coworker and we had an awesome experience. First of all, the customer service is amazing. They were SO friendly and SO helpful- their kindness blew me away. Second of all, their bubble tea was amazing. I have never had bubble tea before and went for the acai berry with black tea and it was super tasty. I really enjoyed it. They had a TON of options for flavors, and they also have coffee as well as sugar cane juice and some other drink options as well. Third and most importantly, the banh mi. OMG. My coworker ordered the traditional banh mi and I went for the chicken banh mi. The bread was so fresh and so tasty, the fresh cucumber and carrot were delicious, the meat was tasty and so flavorful and the hint of cilantro topped it off. I also added sriracha and jalapenos and loved the spicy kick. Two drinks and two sandwiches and our total was about $20- what a deal! We were able to sit outside too, which was awesome on such a beautiful Spring day. I loved this place and was really impressed. I cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"I had such a pleasant experience going to this shop... they seated next door to the barbershop I go to and I popped in for lunch one day. The business is family owned/operated and everyone was super friendly. I had a pork bahn mi and was really impressed. Definitely the best Bahn Mi I've had in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere, like coming over to a friends house that happens to serve boba tea (they've got \"Popping Boba\" in strawberry, passion fruit and more - so good!) and awesome Vietnamese beef stew! :) Inexpensive, well-spiced and staff is all so friendly. Very good on a blustery, wintery day."}
{"text":"Wow. The food was spectacular, fast (less than 5 minutes to prepare) and the proprietors were refreshingly genuinely enthusiastic and excited about their food. Definitely don't miss this place."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite 'cheap eat' in Pittsburgh and a contender for all-around favorite. The boyfriend and I have alternated between saying we really wish they delivered and are really glad they don't because we might put in a delivery order every night. Super fresh ingredients, excellent service, and the meats are so flavorful. The drunken beef and pork n roll bowls are my favorite"}
{"text":"We ordered the Viet Special and the Pork N Roll. The sandwiches were probably about 10 inches; so good for quick lunch but not over filling. The sandwiches we ordered were very good (we never had banh mi before so we can't compare). They will make your sandwich spicy if you'd like too! I'd say that the bread was a little tough. I also think the sandwiches could have either used more fillings or less bread (bread to meat/toppings was less impressive). The menu list is short, but I'd argue that is part of the charm: they focus of making food quick and tasty. We waited about only 5 minutes for our sandwiches!! The staff was so friendly and the cafe space was super trendy and cute! I would definitely recommend coming for a fast, tasty lunch! I can't wait to come back and try their rice bowls!!"}
{"text":"Banh Mi and Ti is pretty good. The space itself is more like a small cafe with a stand at the front to order and a few small tables in the back. Definitely only go as a pair if you're planning to eat there.  My banh mi was good. I'm inexperienced with them, but I liked it. You have a couple different combinations of meats and vegetables. All sandwiches come with the option of Siracha and/or jalapeno peppers.  I also had a cold tea (non-bubble). It was good."}
{"text":"Thanks to the Yelp community I was *SO* thrilled to find a real legitimate banh mi spot! Like many of the reviewers have already mentioned, if you live or have lived here in Pittsburgh.. you know this was EXACTLY what we are missing in our city.   My mom and I came in on a Tuesday afternoon to order for a take-out not long after they opened and almost all of the seats were already taken - that's how yummy this place is! We had drunken beef and xa xiu banh mi & banh mi bo kho to go - all so delicious and perfectly seasoned to our tastes. My mom can be a picky eater when it comes to any Asian cuisine but if she says it's good, you just have to believe her. We also had ca phe sua da, which is so satisfying and goes great with banh mi. But next time I already know I gotta try their nuoc mia (sugarcane drink).  Overall this place has surpassed my expectations! I'm so excited to know that the next time I crave banh mi.. there's a spot 20 mins away from me!"}
{"text":"I loved it here. The bahn mi is delicious and the bubble tea is made just right (so many places do it wrong!!) I really can't wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"I love their pork rice bowl, although I would be happy with just the vegetables.  The staff is super friendly and attentive to their customers.  I love sitting at one of their tables while eating.  The teas are great.  Enjoyed every moment and go back at least every other week."}
{"text":"Wow, Bahn Mi & Ti absolutely nailed it last weekend on our visit to Pittsburgh. We ordered the Drunken Beef Rice Bowl and traditional Banh Mi sandwich, both of which were very delicious and honestly some of the best tasting Vietnamese food I've eaten in the states. For drinks we ordered the Vietnamese style iced coffee with condensed milk and even came back post-meal to try one of their strawberry green teas (Both drinks were incredible). You can really tell everyone working here was happy to assist and the patio area was great for a relaxing meal outside. Can't wait to come back again soon."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches (I've tried the Viet Special, Drunken Beef, and the Classy Chick)!.......Personable owners, really sweet spirits!......Stop by, you'll be glad you did"}
{"text":"Not a bad stop for a quick snack or coffee fuel up. I've probably been biased by my many years of West Coast living, but I thought everything was just okay. Nothing was particularly flavorful or made with care.   The chicken and drunken beef bowls were okay, and the tofu banh mi was enjoyed by the vegetarian. The Vietnamese iced coffee, however, was great.   They do have a slick, clean decor and a small patio that was being dominated by a loud family when we were there. Inside they were playing country music, which was an interesting if incongruent choice."}
{"text":"Love this place! Favs are tofu banh mi, shrimp spring rolls, and black milk tea with boba and lychee...but everything has been delicious. The girls behind the counter are awesome...good vibes and good food keep us coming back."}
{"text":"As always, I'm always craving for Vietnamese food! I saw that this place had good rating & I liked the area that it was in. We went & had dinner there. The sandwiches were really good. Especially the bread. And really great Vietnamese coffee! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The explosion of places that offer bahn mi in Pittsburgh (Streets on Carson, Smallman Galley, Hidden Harbor...) is remarkable, but Banh Mi and Ti can't be beat for quick and friendly service, variety, and taste.  I've tried at least four varieties now and have enjoyed them all (chicken and pork'n'roll are my favorites).  Plus as far as I know, it's the only place in Lawrenceville where you can get bubble tea!  Great addition to Butler Street."}
{"text":"The owner is super nice. I had the special Banh Mi, and my Hubby had the Xia Xiu (not sure about the spelling). Bread was toasted, and super super nicely crunchy.  Mine was alright, and I wished there was more sauce.  Xia Xiu one was quite nice, but a little bit fatty.  Overall, food was very nice, and the experience was enjoyable!"}
{"text":"The BEST Vietnamese establishment I've been to in Pittsburgh..  the pork n' roll bowl is phenomenal, as well as the chicken and drunken beef. The bahn me is always amazing. I've truly never had a complaint about this place and I've been at least 20 times in the past 2 months.     Get the lightbulbs back so I can buy a drink in one!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Banh Mi & Ti for quite sometime, and it did not disappoint! Upon entering the door, I was greeted by the friendly staff. I asked a few questions on different Milk Ti and spices that they have, and they were super friendly!  I went with the Pork N' Roll sandwich with jalapenos, and my girlfriend ordered the beef sandwich. Both were absolutely delicious! The bread is perfectly toasted, and each bite is so flavorful. The Green Milk Ti was the best that I've had in Pittsburgh as well!  I'll definitely be back to try some of their other sandwiches."}
{"text":"I decided to try Bahn Mi and Ti before an appointment next door and I was not disappointed. The staff were extremely friendly as soon as I walked in the door. I ordered the Classy Chick and it came out rather quickly. The bread was crunchy, the toppings were flavorful and the chicken was well cooked. This is an excellent, quick, affordable option in Lawrenceville. I'll definitely be back to try more of their Bahn Mis."}
{"text":"The place definitely nailed it in terms of staff friendliness and atmosphere . The place is definitely cozy and worth a try. Although there were so many great reviews about this new place, I was a bit disappointed.  I was excited to try this new place! I went there on Saturday night around 5:30 PM. To my disappointment, they had ran out of bread, sugar cane juice and we were one of the last few people who were able to score rice bowls. Although I wanted the bahn mi, I decided to give the rice bowl a chance. We ordered the drunken beef rice bowl, cha siu rice bowl, chai milk tea and green tea to go. As we got our drinks, my chai milk tea wasn't that great. I could still taste the powder with every sip that I took and there wasn't enough sugar. However, the green tea with lychee jelly was good. As for the food, I thought that the drunken beef were slices of beef as how other Vietnamese places make the bbq beef but it was more of a meatloaf consistency which I wasn't expecting and didn't really like it. The cha siu was good.   Overall, I would try it again to see what the other items in the menu are. Keep in mind that the prices for the bahn mi are a bit more expensive than bahn mi's that you can find at the strip district."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Nice coffee shop vibe from a sandwich shop, I like the bright colors they use and the entryway lets in a lot of light. It's a little cramped when you walk in but thankfully they have seating which extends into the back of the building as well as a few tables outside. Water is self-serve from a countertop cooler. Service is friendly and they'll readily help you if you you're having difficulty deciding what to get.  Food: I've tried all their sandwiches and can say they're all fairly tasty. I feel there is some bias to the American palate as you won't find strong flavors of pâté or pickles (do chua) and the heat from the jalapeños+sriracha is relatively tame. While not the most authentic tasting, the ingredients do taste very fresh and the meats well-seasoned. The rice flour baguettes are also the real deal, airy and crispy.   Overall I like Banh Mi & Ti as they offer nice clean flavors and use quality ingredients in their sandwiches. I'd recommend this place or Ineffable Ca Phe if you have a hankering although don't expect \"down and dirty\" bold flavors like the shops in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"Bubble tea ...if you have never tried go to Banh Mi and tea first because this place does it right Squishy chewy perfect tapioca bubbles You want them nice,soft & squishy  They make tea in many flavors  With milk or with out  This day I think I found my favorite honey  Green tea with honey a mint leaf and thin slice of apple this is a lovely drink made with care  And then the banh mi (sandwich) They have many choices including fried tofu  Delicate fried tofu pillows with shredded carrots thin sliced cucumbers and their yummy sauce  Toasty long roll it's just so good You can watch them make the teas there is great care here  A narrow counter in front and tables in the back Everyone is so nice and friendly  And will gladly answer your questions about the teas and the banh mis This is Lawrenceville parking can be a hassle but if you want the best bubbles find a spot and go enjoy"}
{"text":"I was so excited to check this place out and it definitely did not disappoint! I used to live near a few Vietnamese sandwich shops in the Italian Market area in Philly and have always been a huge fan of Bahn Mi sandwiches. The combo of the crusty bread, meat and bitter veggies is such a delectable flavor! Throw in some bubble tea and I'm a very happy girl.  The shop is warm and inviting. Not huge inside, but we had no problem snagging a table. There is a bar along the wall with seating in the front room, a few tables in the back room and some outdoor seating as well. We were greeted immediately with smiles and an offer to explain anything on the menu if needed. They have a nice explanation of how the traditional Bahn Mi sandwich came to be, which is located on the wall opposite from the counter.  I had the Drunken Beef and my fiancé had the Viet Special. We were both very satisfied with our decisions and wished that we had room to try some of their fresh spring rolls! There's always next time for that. I love that they have the option of milk teas and also black/green/oolong for the bubble tea. They have a great variety of flavors to mix and even have a few varieties of the Bursting boba that I love.   Great food, great location. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I had the pork with maple syrup yesterday with extra jalapeños and the shrimp fresh spring rolls. Banh mi was good but was lacking moisture. Not as good as the cart in the Strip outside Bar Marco but still very tasty. Loved the spring rolls-rice paper was perfect consistency and texture. Shrimp and other goodies inside were crisp and fresh. Maybe the best fresh roll I've ever had! Can't wait to go back and try some more from their menu."}
{"text":"Vietnamese street food?  Yes please.  Love the Banh Mi here.  Best I've had outside of Vietnam.  I've never been to Vietnam, but strictly speaking that's still a true statement.  They're good.  Lots of great choices and a couple that I encourage you to push your comfort zone with (I'm talking about you, head cheese).    Had never had bubble tea (ti?) before this, and really enjoyed the Acia berry, black tea with tapioca pearl \"toppings\".  (I put it in quotes because...they aren't on the top.  They drop to the bottom, and every time the girl (the same energetic, friendly young lady always seems to take my order) asks me if I want toppings I freeze like a deer in the headlights until I remember she's talking about the \"bubbles\" in bubble tea (ti?).  Anyway...great casual dining inside or out on the patio on Butler street.  People watching galore."}
{"text":"Just another great addition to possibly the Foody-est neighborhood in the Burgh! Banh Mi & Ti absolutely delivered a solid Vietnamese sandwich.     I've been meaning to try this place out ever since it opened a couple years ago, and I was not disappointed in the least. I had the pork n' roll Banh mi, a Vietnamese coffee and the shrimp spring rolls, and while everything was very good, nothing really blew me away either.    First off, the sandwich. It was everything that you would expect in a good Banh Mi. Fresh veggies, a good amount of pork and a nice roll. While the flavors were all there, I found it to be a tad boring. More spice, more sweet, more salt, would go a long way with this already very good sandwich.    Next, the Shrimp spring rolls. Again, along with the Banh Mi, they are good, but very par for the course. They taste pretty much like every other good shrimp roll that I've ever had. Not a bad thing, just would like something more exciting from a hot, new Lawrenceville food stop.    Lastly, the Vietnamese coffee. It's good. For me, it was a little heavy on the condensed milk. I prefer the coffee to shine through and the sweetness to be secondary. Also, a medium cost 4.60, which is a bit over priced. The 16oz cup is full of ice, only leaving you with maybe 8oz of drink. I'm not usually one to complain about pricing, but in this instance it seemed a bit over the top. However, I find the rest of their menu is a very good value, especially the sandwiches.    Overall, it was a very nice dining experience. Service was great, very nice space and awesome outdoor seating. Food is very good, but could use some excitement to bump it up to 5 stars."}
{"text":"It feels weird to be among the more critical reviews in rating 4 stars, but hopefully these comments will at least help one or two people. It's definitely cool that Pittsburgh finally has a dedicated banh mi place, and they did it in a way that fits right into the neighborhood that is Lawrenceville. The ambiance is clean and modern, the item names are cute and concisely described, and there are appropriate vegan options. (This comment may be interpreted as a subtle jab at an overly gentrified feeling and price range for this type of food, which I think is a valid observation, but not something that influenced this review!)  They offer several different types of meats on their sandwiches, or rice bowls if you prefer. Some of them have some fusion elements, like white wine or maple syrup, which I think is pretty creative. The Viet Special is made and tasted pretty much like the traditional banh mi that you would find at places at other cities where this is a staple. The baguette seemed fresh and crispy, though it was a bit plain and could have used some more butter inside. The bo kho bowl was very savory and great for warming up on a cold day. In terms of taste, I think it is superior to the one offered at Cambod-Ican in the Southside, but the portion size was much smaller despite the cheaper price.  They also have bubble tea! It's not cheap, but they have variations not found at some of the places in Oakland, like acai, lavendar, kumquat, and dates. We tried a Logan and Dates fruit tea, and it was super refreshing with date and jelly pieces."}
{"text":"If you're craving something light, healthy, and savory, bahnmi is the way to go! I highly recommend the xa xiu bahnmi because the marinated pork is just really soft and delicious. Also, get all the toppings (siracha and jalapeños) for some spicy flavor and add a fried egg as an extra topping. If you're a fan of eggs and spicy food, you have to try that combo."}
{"text":"I seriously love this place. The drunken bahn mi is sooooo good. When I can't think of anything else to eat , this is where I go :)"}
{"text":"Update: I came back on a whim and ordered the same tofu sandwich and this time it was delicious! Very flavorful, great sauce on on carrots, loved the spice level, great bread. A whole different experience. I can't remember if I had the peppers and sriracha last time, so maybe that made the difference?  I also ordered a plain green tea bubble tea and it was very refreshing and complimented the sandwich perfectly. I am definitely returning and trying new bubble tea flavors."}
{"text":"Decent bahn mi and Thai iced coffee! Worth visiting!"}
{"text":"To say that I was thrilled when I found out a banh mi place was opening walking distance from my office is an understatement, and my expectations were pretty high. This place definitely lives up to my internal hype. I especially like their tofu, which is tough to get right, and it's cool that they offer a rice bowl option in addition to the standard sandwich. The owners of this restaurant couldn't be nicer people and it is a genuinely a pleasure to go here. They make an effort to get to know you and are all smiles. They also nailed the aesthetic of the place (great business cards, interior decor, t-shirts etc.). I absolutely love this business."}
{"text":"The menu here is focused, and it shows in the quality.  The banh mi is the best you'll find in Pittsburgh, and could give places in LA a run for their money.  The bread is fantastically fresh; soft with a crispy crust that you'll only get when it's right out of the oven.  They do a great classic banh mi with head cheese and pate, but the char siu is also excellent.  I usually spring for a Vietnamese coffee - the bubble tea is solid, but not as good as Fuku Tea when it comes to the texture of the tapioca pearls.  The sugar cane juice (fresh squeezed!) is mostly a novelty, as it is rather expensive for a small cup."}
{"text":"Delicious bahn mi sandwiches! We ordered the Pork N' Roll and the Classy Chick Bowl. The sandwich was by far the best thing! The bowl was good too, just not as good as the sandwich. The bread was crunchy, the mayo wasn't overpowering, and the pork was cooked perfectly!  The service was great-- everyone was smiling and very kind. There is street parking available but you might have to drive a few times around the block. A fantastic place for a quick bite before The Row House!"}
{"text":"This is such a wonderful new little restaurant!  I would say I eat here at least once or twice a week.   When you walk in, you are greeted with smiles. Even when they are super busy, you never feel like you're being hurried a long. You order at the counter and you can eat in or take it to go.     The customer service is outstanding. I called to order food, thinking that they closed an hour later than they did, so it ended up being about 15 minutes before they closed. Rather than be rude and telling me that they closed in 15 minutes ( which most places would do), I was pleasantly surprised that I was encouraged to order Togo and that they were happy to take my order!  They called me back to clarify a missing part of my order and also put the thought into putting our sauces on the side, without us even asking. Our whole conversation, she was just so nice and even told me to tell the person picking my order up to drive safe. That to me, goes above and beyond.    The food is consistent, simple, and fresh. They make everything to order.  It literally is the owners and their family making the food!  The bubble tea is the best that I've had in Pittsburgh. The tea is organic, the boba is the perfect consistency every time, and they even make their own aloe chunks for their drinks!    I never really traveled to this side of town, but I make the trip weekly now just to come here.  The inside is simple and trendy. Such a gem and I'm so glad that we finally have a spot like this in Pittsburgh!  I always leave with a smile, whether I eat in or take out!"}
{"text":"I've tried this place for the first time from a friends suggestion, and this place did not disappointed. The people were super nice with great vibes in the restaurant, and the tea and banh mi were delicious!"}
{"text":"This place!! The owners and staff are so personable and the food is super authentic. Absolutely go!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for a good...scratch that...the best bahn mi. The viet special is the traditional, as well as my favorite. Personally I am not a fan of bubble tea in general, but everyone around me seemed to enjoy them. I did, however, sip on come coffee. Not any ordinary coffee, they stock Cafe du Monde coffee, and brew it to order with a single serve drip brewer. Last but not least, the people are the kindest I have ever seen in a restaurant. Mi and Ti really know what they're doing. Now stop reading and go get ya a bahn mi."}
{"text":"Very good sandwiches, bubble tea, and coffee. The place is very cute and I like their service. Great experience overall. Although I think the sandwiches is a little on the expensive side."}
{"text":"So I love Vietnamese homecooking, but I never tried a banh mi. I didnt think it'd be AS GOOD as Tv and other people said it was. I was wrong.  It doesnt look like much, but it's worth the $8 imo.  EDIT: Eh, that might be prejudice against blacks."}
{"text":"Love this place. Family owned, great atmosphere and really delicious food. Everyone behind the counter is so friendly. We once time called ahead to check their hours and they called us back an hour later to inform us that they were out of something on the menu. Over the top thoughtfulness. Great bubble tea as well. Pleasant surprise. The tea and flavors are are made with authentic ingredients, just not sugar and concentrates."}
{"text":"Did not really enjoy the taro bubble tea. Not sure what milk was used but tarp flavor wasn't strong or sweet enough to my liking. The vermicelli bowl with pork was good but not the best I've had"}
{"text":"Banh mi lovers look no further! Fresh bread. All the ingredients you could ask for. So many options between the food and the bubble teas. It's easy to customize it just how you like it. Honestly crafted with care. The owners are genuinely great people, which makes me want to support this place even more. They knew I was waiting for someone and they were almost out of baguettes (make sure to get there earlier the word is out on how good this place is) and they saved 2 for me while I waited. I had the chai bubble tea with boba and the classy chick banh mi, both equally awesome. I will be back to this place for many reasons!"}
{"text":"Unexpectedly quick and delicious! Great for if you just want to come and go for a casual lunch. Definitely say \"yes\" to the extra jalapeños and Sriracha, as I feel the sandwich can be a bit lacking in powerful flavors if you leave them off. But I put hot sauce on literally everything so I may be biased/my taste buds may have burned off long ago. I am a vegetarian so thus always opt for the tofu banh mi. The summer rolls are also fresh and yummy.  I've been looking for a good bubble tea place since moving to Pittsburgh, and Banh Mi and Ti definitely delivers. I'm obsessed with the lavender flavor. It's nice that you can pick which kind of tea it is made with as well, as I haven't seen this at other places. Black, green, or oolong.  My boyfriend and I get cravings for this place on the reg, and it's just to stop by and eat on their cute tiny lil' patio.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing, and we are foodies!  We got seconds. The people are so nice too. LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"Everything on their menu is excellent. This restaurant is a superb addition to the Lawrenceville area. If I could eat here every day is the week I certainly would."}
{"text":"This is a solid banh mi. I've had the drunken beef, pork belly, chicken, and kho bo. The bread is excellent, though much denser than traditional banh mi if that's what you're accustomed to. The beef options are my favorites, with the drunken beef boasting a tangy flavor from white wine. The kho bo is rich and warming, and comes as a large bowl of beef and carrot stew with a plain baguette. I really appreciated that the staff accommodated my request for a side of the veggies (cilantro, cucumber, carrot) that go on the other sandwiches. While they don't normally go with kho bo, I liked having them to make my own little sandwiches. The bubble teas are very good with ample bubbles, and the staff is very friendly when taking often long phone orders for my coworkers and I.   I have to say that I'm not totally wild about their pickled carrots. Everywhere else I've had banh mi, the carrots are julienned so that they maintain some crunch. Often they are mixed with daikon which adds even more taste and textural variety. However, here the carrots are shredded very finely, and they lose much of their appealing crunch. Not a deal breaker but they could really improve the whole sandwich. Also, on several sandwiches I've had tastes of fish sauce that were unexpected. The menu states that it comes on the pork belly, which is fine, but there was an overwhelming amount that drowned out the other flavors. On other sandwiches that don't claim to be topped with fish sauce, I've tasted it on random bites, almost like it was on a utensil and got transferred. Again, I'm fine with fish sauce and understand that it's a vital Vietnamese ingredient, but if it's going to be used uncooked in its most pungent form, I'd like to know in advance."}
{"text":"Friendly and welcoming staff said hello as soon as I stepped in the door of this cute and cozy establishment. There are long bench tables with stools in the front, tables and couches in the back.      Fresh bread was delicious on my sandwich...Bahn mi with tofu...was good overall but not one I still crave like one I had from a food truck last summer. Loved the bubble tea.     Place was clean and tidy...including the restrooms."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place to get banh mi in Pittsburgh. Prices are fair, and I was pleasantly surprised by the great and helpful service. Even the set-up was very cute and modern. Would definitely recommend to people looking for authentic, quality banh mi. 6/5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Updated review: I still love Banh Mi and Ti. There are a handful of restaurants that I go to regularly in Pittsburgh, and Banh Mi and Ti has definitely become one of them. It's hard for me to try new sandwiches because I've become so attached to the ones I like, but the original, the Xiao Chao (BBQ pork), and the chicken one are all amazing.  The rice bowls are bomb as well-- would definitely try to go with a friend and get both. Like I mentioned in the previous review, the family that owns the place is the sweetest family ever. They always remember me and greet me by name which just makes me feel so special.   Seating is still limited, but they have a to- go option as well."}
{"text":"I don't think i've ever given 5 stars for a small tea and sandwich join before, but these Vietnamese style sandwiches (bahn mi) definitely deserve it! The drunken beef is fantastic! LOADED with flavor and just so unbelievably simple and good. Their buns are amazing, great crunch. All in all this may be one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten. The place is super tiny with three two tops in the back, 2 chairs, and two nook tables and chairs. There's a bar that runs along the wall. I'm hoping they will put some chairs and tables outside this summer (today would have been the perfect day to sit outside). The summer rolls were also great and I loved my chai tea with red beans. The sandwiches are also huge so you get a lot for the price. Service was quick and very friendly. They were helpful and willing to answer any questions you might have about the different options. I can't wait to go back and try some of their different options."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches for a great price. I would eat lunch here everyday! I had the viet special which was some pork cold cuts and pate. I tried everyone elses dish and they were all amazing! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best bubble tea in the city. The banh mis were also quite good but it depends on which one you order :) (sorry I forget which ones I got). Will update whenever I go back!"}
{"text":"My experience seems to be vastly different from the majority of patrons.  I can only speak on what I observed here.  1). This aint your mamas vietnamese bakery.  The bahn mi here is around 8 bucks compared to the three bucks Im accustomed at various Denver or Minneapolis vietnamese spots.  The only difference is the baguette is a tad longer with greater fillings.  2). Propietors are suspected bigots.  I walk in, barely a whimper.  Just silence, as she awaits my order.  White woman enters minutes later (with chinese woman in tow interestingly) to a chorus of helloes, and helpful explanations about the menu.  I depart....woman begrudges me a thank you, as if its painful.  Just minutes prior two white men exit, to a chorus of thank yous.  They made their point, and I wont return.  3). As I waited, I witnessed two different employees, cough directly into their hands while preparing beverages.  Yuck.  Lcukily I hadnt ordered a drink.  Im a healthcare professional and hyper-aware of things like  that."}
{"text":"I really like this place despite it being a bit pricey for the amount of food/drink. Because of dietary restrictions - I can only eat the chicken banh mi but it's pretty tasty! I only say it's pricey because I always had to eat two in order for it to be a filling lunch.   My favorite drink that they offer is lavender bubble tea! Anyone who knows me well knows that I am a sucker for lavender flavored anything and this bubble tea did not disappoint!    The location of this place is also great. I was able to always take relaxing walks with my friends on butler street after grabbing lunch here."}
{"text":"A friend and I split a Viet Special and a Pork n Roll Bahn Mi. Both sandwiches were fantastic, flavorful and the ingredients tasted fresh. I have had a few Bahn Mis in Ho Chi Minh City and I was not disappointed with these versions. More than the sandwiches, I loved the service from the staff, everyone was pleasant. The staff members took significant time to explain the tea drinks they offered, being polite the entire time. Only negative was not having an herbal tea or noncaffeine tea option but this is solely out of preference and not a reflection on this great establishment. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"This is a nice find, since there isn't a lot of places serve real sugar cane juice outside of the Vietnamese communities.  Sugar cane juice is a must have for the summer!"}
{"text":"Food tasted fresh, large portion sizes, and everything was inexpensive. I had the Pork N' Roll Banh Mi and can't wait to go back to try the rest. It was a great combo of sweet and spicy and I definitely recommend adding the Sriracha and Jalapeños. Fair warning though, seating is very limited."}
{"text":"This is my first time at Bahn Mi & Ti. The restaurant was busy but the friendly staff waited on me right away and my order was ready in a short period of time. A friend recommended I try the Drunken Beef and although I rarely eat beef the sandwich wasn't a disappointment.  The baguette roll is slightly crunchy on the outside and soft inside, the beef was tender and the picked vegetables, homemade mayo and sweet onions were the perfect accompaniment. If you like a spicy kick try putting some of the jalapeños. You can use Apple and Samsung pay too! I will visit the eatery again!"}
{"text":"I love Banh Mi and Ti so much! As soon as you walk in, you are welcomed by the super friendly staff and cute decor! The pork n roll banh mi is soooo good! It's made with delicious crusty bread, really fresh tasting veggies, and sweet and savory pork.  The bubble tea here is a must too! I love the taro milk tea with green tea.  It tastes almost like a milkshake!  The restaurant itself isn't very large, but there is still a decent amount of seating.  If you're looking for a cute place to meet a friend for lunch or a casual date spot, I would highly recommend Banh Mi and Ti!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! We got the classy chic and the drunken beef sandwiches. Tons of flavor and the bread tasted fresh. Also got the mango milk bubble tea which I was a big fan of. Looking forward to going back"}
{"text":"Banh Mi is my favorite sandwich in the whole wide world. There's nothing like the combination of sweet meat, acidic veggies, crusty bread, and a hit of heat. Up until very recently, there weren't many Pittsburgh options, so I'd have to seek out these lovely little sandwiches in other cities.   Thank goodness for Banh Mi and Ti: A brick and mortar shop selling delicious Banh Mi and tasty bubble tea.   Fist off, the staff is incredibly kind and helpful. They answered my questions and everyone seemed to be in a great mood: like they genuinely enjoyed being there. It was refreshing.  I ordered the Classy Chick and a taro milk tea with boba. The sandwich was incredible! The chicken was coated in a slightly sweet sauce. The bread was crusty and delightful and the veggies were perfectly pickled. Everything together tasted fresh and flavorful. The bubble tea was also flavorful, but not overly sweet (which I appreciate).   I can't wait to come back and try other options. Thank you for existing, Banh Mi & Ti!"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite banh mi and viet ice coffee places!!! Been coming here for a while and it has never let me down. The banh mi's are substantial and delicious. Definitely try the drunken beef one!!! And the iced vietnamese coffee never fails to hit the spot, perfect sweetness and boldness! Ask for less ice cause the ice takes up about 60% of the cup. The service is always friendly; and the interior is very clean, aesthetic, and group & work friendly (not too much seating tho, but when weather is nice there's outdoor seating!).  tldr; food 10/10 interior 9/10 service 10/10"}
{"text":"Crisp bread, fresh flavors, what's not to love about this place?  Boba was excellent - I ordered an almond milk tea (black) with some caramel pudding.  I had the pork belly sandwich and it was delicious.  I am definitely going to come back again and they are really friendly!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for lunch today after reading all of the great reviews. I was especially impressed with how friendly and patient they were as I asked questions about the menu. The food, as everyone has said, is amazing. I was really appreciative that there is no dairy in any of the dishes since I am lactose intolerant. And they caught onto that when I asked what \"head cheese\" is, it's like a salami, and made sure to ask if I wanted my strawberry ti without milk. One of the owners came over, she also made our awesome sandwiches, and we had a nice conversation with her. I can't wait to come back to this new family run restaurant!"}
{"text":"Have always wanted a good Bahn Mi sammy in Pittsburgh. Until now, there's never been a place to get them. I got the \"Pork n'Roll\" sandwich, which was delicious. Welcome to Lawrenceville!!"}
{"text":"Always hunting for great banh mi and this place did not disappoint! The friendliest people you could imagine run this place and they deliver a fabulous menu along with ambiance and experience. Try the sugarcane juice! So refreshing and unique!"}
{"text":"Yum. Fast and healthy and great family working. Rice bowls and rolls are excellent."}
{"text":"Authentic Vietnamese food with high-quality ingredients. Service was excellent and a very nice ambience. Would repeat."}
{"text":"Love the Viet special. Has pâté, head cheese. Head cheese was very thinly sliced, very good. Summer roll was done well, I think a little bit too much greens. Which made it a large roll. Shrimp was prepared nicely, cooked just right. The Thai iced tea was strong, the way I like it. superb! Will be back."}
{"text":"Super glad to have found this spot. Really rounds out the unique personality that you can rely on Lawrenceville for. Small amount of outdoor seating was perfect for the weather.   Ambiance: Super casual and small. The staff was obnoxiously welcoming and was willing to answer all our questions - no matter how stupid they were.   Food:  Vietnamese special, Drunken Beef Rice Bowl, Iced Vietnamese coffee, and Strawberry Green tea with Aloe Vera. I literally couldn't tell you which was the best. I personally had the Rice bowl and it was super great. The rice was delicious with the meat and veggies were covered in a delicious sweet sauce. If you're ok with a little spice, be sure to add the jalapeños because they really added to the depth of the dish and complimented the sauce.   The tea was superb as well, especially since I had no idea what I was doing with the ordering. Honestly, I dont think they would let you go wrong even if you could.   Will absolutely go again. such a phenomenal addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Bahn Mi & Ti is a great change of pace for the area, and a perfect spot for lunch.  My go-to is the Viet Special.  The pickled veggies are out of this world, and I could gladly just eat a bowl of them alone.  The mix of textures on the sandwich comes together very well.  Their baguettes always have the perfect blend of hard crunch and chew inside.  The prices are good, and the sandwiches are made very fast.    Their drinks are less spectacular.  The bubble tea is solid, but prices are a little on the high side compared to other options and the quality doesn't match the price."}
{"text":"Small excellent menu with chicken beef and vegetable entrées huge spring shrimp rolls and wonderful ginger flavored gravy on the beef stew.  Orders are huge.  You will need take home containers. Well worth finding a parking spot. casual friendly staff and very comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Hands down the ~best~ banh mi place to go to in Pittsburgh. First off, Banh Mi + Ti is women owned, founded by two sisters!! Situated in the heart of Lawrenceville, the Vietnamese eatery is a local favorite that evokes simplicity and sweetness. It has outdoor seating and a cute interior with a wall that customers can draw on. The banh mi is deliciously addicting... They offer a few options including vegetarian. The Pork n Roll is my usual - pork shoulder, maple syrup, five spices. I always end up with an Iced Vietnamese Coffee, easily finished quickly because it's so good. Perfectly sweet. The hot Vietnamese coffee tastes much richer!  Street parking is available if you can find a spot!"}
{"text":"I couldn't love a sandwich shop any more! The service here and the food is always top notch. The Bánh mì sandwiches are served on BreadWorks bread baked fresh daily, and you can tell. The bread is so fresh, light and airy with the perfect crunch, this alone will keep you coming back for more. You can opt for the sandwich to be served over rice, a great alternative if you're in the mood for a big bowl of warm rice instead of baguette. The teas (organic might I add) are amazing and sweetened with cane juice they juice fresh for every order. Kelly, all of the staff, is so so very friendly. The ambience is clean and modern. Vegan options as well.  Perfect lunch spot! I love to support this small local business."}
{"text":"Excellent location. Would recommend to any looking for a delicious rice bowl or sandwich. Keep in mind this is a Vietnamese cafe so it's not a regular restaurant but it there is MUCH to be desired. My only critique is finding a menu online is rather difficult. I hope somewhere from their shop reads this so they fix that. Facebook menu option wasn't available online when I checked. So good. So good."}
{"text":"Stupendously, supremely delicious! Had the Viet Special and the Pork N Roll sandwiches, as well as Summer Rolls, all of which memorably great. Highly flavorful combinations, super fresh ingredients, and the bread was utter bahn mi perfection...nice and crusty with a soft interior. Plus, the service was friendly and prompt. Only wish I didn't live an hour and a half away, otherwise, I'd be haunting this pace several times a week. What a wonderful addition to the Lawrenceville neighborhood."}
{"text":"The new vermicelli bowls are a perfect hot weather treat! So good! Bonus: Much easier to eat than the bread, but still all the flavor of the sandwich!"}
{"text":"I've had boba all over the world and this place is a STANDOUT! I got their iced lavender green tea (you can choose a base of either black or green tea) with lychee jellies and it was so good I got a SECOND one! I am in Pittsburgh 5-6 times a year so I was just getting ready to hit the road home which is about a 6 hours drive and ya know, I needed quality road drinks! You could tell the tea was high quality and freshly made. Also the lavender tea had actual lavender buds/flowers in it. Can't describe how high quality this place is and also the people who work here are ridiculously friendly and so kind! I really enjoyed talking to them and can't wait to come back to Pitt to go here, enjoy their tea and say hello again! I will also have to try their banh mi next time too! Highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"I've been craving a Banh Mi an this place did not disappoint. It is a great portion size and hit all the flavors. Plus the ti was amazing. Def one of my new favs."}
{"text":"LOVED Banh Mi & Ti. It's such a cute little spot in Lawrenceville, I was there for lunch yesterday  and it's abundantly clear it's a popular lunch spot. The line for take-out was long, most tables were filled (indoor seating is pretty limited), and the phone was ringing every minute with new orders. Despite all that, I found a seat and they had my order to me in less than 5 minutes. It only cost me $16 and I ordered a large flavored tea, shrimp spring rolls, and a drunken beef banh mi. It was all delicious. The drunken beef banh mi was the best I've ever had.  The people working were sooooo friendly and the service was quick and efficient. I will be back to try a different banh mi."}
{"text":"I absolutely love banh mi and was so excited to see this place open in my neighborhood. I am equally excited to report that they make really authentic food and that the owners are some of the nicest people I have ever met. They went above and beyond to make sure that everything in my order was perfect.  I have so far only tried the chicken banh mi but could already tell that it was super authentic, in addition to being tasty. I grew up very close to the \"Little Vietnam\" of the greater Washington DC area and grew up eating banh mi at least once every few weeks. I think this is the real deal and very much look forward to trying the other sandwiches!  Also, don't overlook the bubble teas. They are really good here. They make them with organic teas and offer a variety of mix-ins beyond tapioca, including aloe bubbles (my favorite)."}
{"text":"Love this place in Lawrenceville! The service is amazing, the atmosphere fits into Lawrenceville's aesthetic so well, and the food and drink is the perfect pair.  I've had the xa xiu and viet special and both are made with the perfect amount of every ingredient.  The only downfall in coming here, is that the bread is pretty hard on the outside, probably just the type of French bread they use. My mouth gets cut up from eating the sandwiches, but honestly it doesn't stop me from coming back.  The lychee bubble tea is also my favorite bubble tea in ALL of Pittsburgh (that's saying a lot, trust me!)"}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant with good food; 2nd time here; we've had the Viet Special, Pork 'n Roll, Classy Chick Bowl, vietnamese iced coffee and spring rolls. Banh mi bread is deliciously crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. I especially like the viet special particularly with the head cheese and pate; yummmmm. If you want rice, the classy chick bowl was very good; our little girl loved it too. The chicken is super tender and the rice and fixings are very fragrant."}
{"text":"Can they be any nicer? I don't think that could even be possible. The workers are so friendly, sweet, and caring. I have never had a bad experience here and I doubt anyone will, EVER. The owners care about their place and they care about their customers. I basically want to be their best friends and hang out when they are not at work, they are that nice.  I usually come in to get a drink and a thing of spring rolls. I love that they now make the spring rolls to order, so you don't have to get them early and quickly. They are now able to be made all day long! You can choose from tofu or shrimp. I usually go with the shrimp. I love that they are fresh and just wrapped tightly. It stinks whenever you get a fresh roll and the minute you bite in them they are not really that full and they also fall apart! These are really great. I also ask (if I am taking them to go) for some sriracha to be mixed with the hoisan sauce.  I like a little kick!  The sugarcane just is weird and I love it. Is it lemonade? Is it tart? Is it sweet? Is it delicious?! It is great. I usually have to pace myself so I don't suck up this drink so fast. Really, it is hard to not drink it fast. It is just so weird and good! I love it! I have even brought some to my friends just to see their initial reaction. I love their faces. They do not know what to think of it! I like it, and I urge everyone to at least try it...once!  The last time I came in I actually ordered a bahn mi! I ordered the classy chick and added a bit of jalapeno to it. It was a lot of spice! I loved it. The added fresh jalapenos were great! I think that if I also added in the sriracha would have been too much! But the jalapenos were great!  The bread was so fresh. Yum. The chicken done to perfection! Yum. The veggies were crunchy and fresh. Yum. I love it! I am excited to try the other flavors of the bahn mi! YUM.   Go here and go wild with the menu. Try new things. Get to know the staff, aka my possible new best friends. Enjoy this new place. They are really great.   My usual lineup: Classy Chick: Chopped chicken with lemongrass and garlic  Fresh Spring Rolls: Shrimp  Drink: Sugarcane juice"}
{"text":"Fresh, fast and tasty. Cute patio. Great place to stop for a quick snack and to try something new on Butler. Good for a day date, or quick lunch. Need to try their chicory still!"}
{"text":"Finally, Pittsburgh acquires a real Banh Mi place that I would be proud to visit and patronize!    Banh Mi and Ti just opened a couple of weeks ago in Lawrenceville.  They offer a short menu of Vietnamese Sandwiches, Spring Rolls, Rice Bowls and various drinks like Boba tea, Viet Coffee and even the real deal Fresh Sugarcane!  I had the pleasure of eating a couple banh mi sandwiches last week, namely the special cold cut and the char siu (xa xiu) versions.  The bread, right off the bat is fresh and perfectly made for its intended purpose.  The meats are high quality and what I would expect from an authentic Viet restaurant.  I sampled their beef stew and sugarcane drink as well - yummy stuff!  Service was top notch and interior decor inviting and warm.  What I discovered after a long foodie discussion with the owners is that everything's thoughtfully sourced from key areas and tested extensively to get it right.  I am impressed to say the least.  As expected, they are working through all the kinks to smooth out all the operational boo-boos their first few weeks.  There is no doubt in my mind Banh Mi and Ti will be around for a long time and I wish them the best.  See you there!"}
{"text":"Yahoo, great service and top notch Banh Mi.  On this visit had the Xa Xiu which is a roasted pork belly with char ixu base and fish base that comes with fresh toppings and you can get sriracha.  As everyone has said, the service is super friendly and willing to explain anything they serve before you order.  It was crowded with not seats when we were there today so we got it to go.  Even though it was crowded our sandwiches came out relatively fast.  If you are looking for a good authentic Viet sandwich, or spring rolls or rice bowls this is your place."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place.   First the food - wow. Got the Pork n' Roll which I'd recommend to everyone. Meat was tender and juicy, veggies were perfectly balanced to taste, and the extra kick from the five different spices was much appreciated.   Second the cafe - so cute! Took my time eating and reading a book in the back tables. Good lighting and the people were very nice.  Third the price - very satisfying sandwich for only $7.50! How can you beat that?!  Also the oolong Bubble tea I got was a extra plus. Yum. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Food: 2 Decor: 3 Service: 4  Came here for lunch once earlier this year.  1. Pork 'n Roll banh mi ~Didn't like. Bread wasn't crispy, and the flavors tasted a bit off, almost like fish sauce.  2. Milk tea ~Didn't like. Tasted a bit watered down.  Service was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Their food is always fresh. I love their drunken beef bahn mi and spring roll. It's Bahn Mi place, but I seriously had my best spring rolls here. I'm giving only fours stars because their bubble tea is not my favorite."}
{"text":"A Lawrenceville favorite of mine!  I've had the Pork N' Roll sandwich and also the ClassyChick bowl.  Both amazing!  I also got the black tea bubble tea which was perfect.  I plan to go back more in the summer when I can sit outside and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great little place in Lawrenceville to pick up something unique for lunch or dinner. I ordered the Xa Xiu bahn mi which is a delightfully \"crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside\" french baguette sandwich packed with char siu pork, carrots, coriander, cucumber, and fish sauce. You can request jalapenos and Sriracha in your sandwich, which I recommend as it adds a nice kick of heat to the sandwich. You can opt to add an over medium egg to the sandwich as well for an additional $1.25. Do it.   Highly recommend the black mango milk tea with boba, but I have yet to try other combinations and their fruit teas.   The interior is cozy and features a few tables inside and outside, along with bar style seating near the order counter. Wait times are very minimal so it's a great place to stop by if you're in a rush or want something to-go."}
{"text":"Incredible place overall! I've been twice now, and I've gotten the Viet Special and the Pork N Roll, and both were absolutely delicious! It's a small place, so seating is limited, but it's very cozy and both times I had no trouble finding a spot. We spoke to the owner as she checked us out and she's a GEM! She walked my mom through the menu and made the experience that much better."}
{"text":"If this restaurant is currently open as you peruse Yelp, close it immediately and head straight there. Trust me on this.  If you're still reading, then it must be after business hours so I'll tell you why this place rules.  I moved here from Philly and we had a bazillion options for banh mi.  Since Pittsburgh is known for sandwiches, imagine my shock at discovering that none of the Vietnamese restaurants serve this fantastic treat!  I found this one on Facebook and discovered today was their soft opening. Score! I came in and found a lovely, clean and modern little restaurant.  They were only serving a few items, so I got 2 Viet Special sandwiches and a Tofu rice bowl. The Viet Special is a very traditional banh mi with a few types of cold cuts, pate and mayo topped with pickled carrots, cukes and cilantro all served on a baguette. They also offer you either jalepeno or sriracha for spice (I went with the latter).     OMG you guys! I am still shaking my head with pleasure. This sandwich was exactly what I've been looking for! They also serve a few varieties with seasoned pork, beef, chicken or fried tofu.  All sounded amazing, but that Viet Special has earned a place in my heart.  I spoke to the owners and these ladies moved here from the Philly area a couple of years back.  They were also saddened by the lack of banh mi, so they made their own.  Eventually friends and friends of friends wanted them and...this dope place was born!  My only qualm is that they don't offer their tofu either baked or sauteed.  I'm not a huge fan of breading and I'd be fine with it on its own.  But that is such a minimal issue.   When you see me stuffing my face in there, be sure to say hi!"}
{"text":"Fresh clean and delicious.  Will definitely visit again and try something else.   The place have fresh spring rolls, sandwiches, coffee and tea.  It is more of a sandwich/coffee shop, they don't have pho or anything other entrees.  Hard to find parking during the day, but then again I am from out of town so what do I know."}
{"text":"My wife was craving Banh Mi so after a day of zip lining we decided to give Banh Mi & Ti a try.  We were so hungry!  We luckily found street parking right in front of the restaurant.  I say luckily because the sky just opened up and a big thunder storm started as we ran in.       We have had Banh Mi before and have made it at home.  Carrie saw good reviews on this place so we had high expectations and they were met!       We looked over the menu at the counter and ordered.  We both ordered Pork Bahn Mi's and a side order of Shrimp Summer Spring Rolls to share.       We went to sit down and our food came to us within 5 minutes.  Just perfect since we were so hungry.  Our sandwiches were excellent.  The summer rolls were delicious too.  If you have never had a Banh Mi before it's hard to explain.  It's just a lot of great flavors exploding in your mouth.  Cilantro, pickled vegetables, Jalapeno's and so much more.  One sandwich each and summer rolls were plenty and we were full after.       You might say it tasted really good because we were so hungry.  My brother and his wife came along with us.  They aren't foodie people and don't eat different food that much.  They still came because we highly recommended trying a sandwich.  They didn't know what to order but they ordered the Summer rolls and a Banh Mi.  They loved it too.  They were pleasantly surprised and I think they are Banh Mi fans now!  We will be back to this great little Bahn Mi shop!"}
{"text":"People have been telling me to go here and I'm glad I did. From the moment I walked in I was greeted by their friendly staff. The lady behind the counter took the time to go over the menu with me. The word Banh Mi is Vietnamese for \"bread.\" I decided to choose the Banh Mi \"Bo Kho\" which is their version of beef stew. She told me I could have it with rice or a baguette. I chose the baguette.  Having heard how good the spring rolls were I decided to order that as a side. You have a choice of either shrimp, tofu or veggie summer rolls is what they call it. I went with their recommendation and ordered the tofu rolls. I was told they take a little longer because they are made fresh daily and right on the spot.   I passed on the bubble tea and ordered green tea instead. I was told that their 3 standard teas (green, black, and oolong) are all organic. I gave them my name and was told to sit down. They have a small but very nice upstairs dining area to get away from the cold.  When I got my Bo Kho I was floored that I got a baguette almost as long as a small long French bread! That thing was huge!  All that for only $8.50. The baguette was made for dipping in the sweet sauce it came in. The entree had large beef chunks along with large chunky carrots. It was literally so good I nearly made a mess of myself but had enough napkins to handle the overflow.  Now to the summer rolls. They were indeed fresh and wrapped in a thin liner. The dipping sauce that came with it I later learned was actually peanut butter drenched with hoisin sauce! It's amazing what different ways places use peanut butter. This sauce was spot on and believe me I would recommend these rolls to anyone who comes. You get two nice sized rolls for only $4.95.  I was chatting with the folks at the next table. The lady had the pork and roll on a baguette which was pork shoulder, maple syrup, and spices. She loved every bit of it.  If you aren't into sandwiches they offer rice bowls. With whatever meat you choose you get steamed jasmine rice, sliced tomatoes, cucumbers, and Vietnamese scallion oil. Pretty much everything is under $10.00 so you can get a good meal at a reasonable cost. Take out is also available.  As far as beverages go, in addition to regular and bubble tea, you can get Vietnamese coffee and sugar cane juice. I'm not sure if they sell bagged coffee but I noticed that some were set up that way.  So you have plenty of options to choose from. The chicken, by the way is thigh meat. While I was dining a person came around and made sure I was doing well. I was very pleased with my meal and with the service. This place is a welcome addition to Lawrenceville and next time I will try the bubble tea."}
{"text":"So happy to come back to this place. I was last in Pittsburgh a year ago and still remembered the Banh mi's and sugarcane juice from this place. Thinking about those items were enough to make me salivate during certain days. Unfortunately, they ran out of sugarcane juice by the time we arrived. Just a heads up, if you want the sugarcane juice, come first thing in the morning. They use fresh sugarcane and juice it right in front of you. Otherwise, the Banh mi definitely hit the spot and am glad to be back here again."}
{"text":"This place is legit. Menu isn't online yet, but you won't be disappointed... Banh Mi, Rice bowls, Bubble Tea all top notch.  And it's a cool little space.  I will go out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"Bahn mi and ti is amazing! The owners are always so warm and friendly - we stopped in about ten minutes before closing one night and they welcomed us in and were even serving people after us. The viet special is definitely my favorite, but the xa xiu sandwich is also very good. Their bubble tea is some of the best I have had in Pittsburgh. Definitely will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"Mmm yummy! My favorite Viet place in Pittsburgh hands down. I am so excited this place is so close to me too. I've been seeing the reviews on here and wanted to come. Today I finally got a chance to, and it was phenomenal! Everything tastes so fresh and authentic. I got pork and roll rice bowl, my boyfriend got bo kho bowl. We both love it, everything .. from the flavor to presentation of the rice bowls. Mmmm.. I want to try the sandwich too, everyone seems to love the sandwich a lot. I'm going to come here a lot, I just know. :-p I also got their boba tea. I ordered a medium mango flavor green tea with aloe Vera and lychee jelly. I love it. The only thing I would suggest improving is, either more staff or expand the seating area. When I went there for lunch, there is an event going on I guess. They're so busy and a lot of customers were waiting for their food standing. It's quite crowded. However, as soon as I got my food, it's worth the wait 100% :) highly recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Growing up Vietnamese, when the other school kids packed PB&Js for lunch, I had my banh mi. I guess you can say I'm the self-proclaimed banh mi guru. Pittsburgh has a limited amount of restaurants that even offer this Vietnamese favorite, so they get automatic bonus points for bringing me back to my roots. They don't serve up your traditional Vietnamese banh mi, that's for sure, however, I don't necessarily consider that a bad thing. They added a little twist and American flare to it, and surprisingly, I didn't hate it. Sure, it can't compare to my mom's banh mi, but it was still delicious. They have several vegetarian options so I ordered the Feelin Tofu banh mi (not sure about that name though). Usually you would find pickled radishes and carrots, but they mixed it up with shredded carrots marinated in a sweet & savory brown sauce. Nothing I've ever had, but it was unique and actually complemented the tofu well. The tofu itself was very spongy. If they swapped it out for firm tofu, it would've been a winner. If you are actually looking for a more traditional version, Vietnam's Pho (now Maiku Sushi) stays true to the Vietnamese staple.   Overall, I rate them 4/5 stars. Service was fantastic - all the employees were very friendly and cheerful. The space is very cute and simplistically modern - although, they could use a few extra tables. The food was actually great despite straying from what banh mi is from a traditional sense. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"You guys, this place is amazing and I mean amazing!!! Before I write about food let me tell you about the staff. It's family owned. Two women and they're sisters-in-law. One of the staff is brother to one owner and sister of the other. Parents do the cooking in the kitchen. Everything on the menu is a family recipe. These are some of the nicest people I've ever met in my life. The friendliest small business owners I think I've ever encountered. Genuinely happy, kind, friendly and eager to explain everything on the menu. The fact that they call us by name is wonderful. It's the atmosphere you want in a local establishment. It was so refreshing to be greeted in such a fashion and to have wonderful conversation with the proud business owners. And proud they should be. The sandwiches we had were nothing short of perfection. I had the Drunken Beef sandwich; ground beef soaked in white wine for two hours and marinated in sweet onion and other spices. Topped with homemade mayo (I ordered without as I don't eat mayo) cilantro, carrots, cucumbers and jalapeños. My boyfriend had The Viet Special special with cured pork, head cheese and the same veggies. Both came on delicious hard rolls. A great styling of Vietnamese and French cuisine. We've decided we need to eat there everyday but will have to settle for once a week.  I love the layout and cozy feel of the interior. It's cozy in the sense that it feels comfortable and relaxing and though it's a smaller space it's not cramped at all. Counter seating in front and tables in back with two arm chairs at a faux fireplace. It's really quite lovely. What a fantastic addition to Lawrenceville. I haven't been this excited about a restaurant in a really long time. Everyone needs to experience the phenomenal flavors and appreciation that we did. PS: They have bubble tea!!!! Oh and Vietnamese coffees & teas too."}
{"text":"Very quickly and easy lunch spot. I ordered the viet special sandwich. It was pretty tasty, but some of the meat inside had some hard and chewy bits. The jalapeños provide a little extra kick to the taste but you can also ask for them on the side if you're a little spice hesitant. Overall would get again!"}
{"text":"I've heard so many good things about this place so I decided that today was going to be the day that I finally tried it. And can I say that I absolutely loved my experience here and the food was so delicious!!  I ordered the Viet Special Banh Mi and a mango green tea bubble tea with lychee jelly. The bread of the Banh Mi was so delicious, crunchy exterior, soft interior. The ratio of meat to bread was perfect and the added veggies have a nice crunch and flavor! I'm not a huge cilantro fan but honestly with the flavors of the Banh Mi, it was delicious. The bubble tea was the perfect sweetness and I got mine without milk, but the flavor was really good and they give you a lot of jelly, which made me happy!!  All in all, I think their food is really solid and so is their welcoming customer service. All of my food came out super fast, everyone was so nice. The environment was really warm and the interior of this place is small but cute! I will definitely be coming here again!!"}
{"text":"From the coffee to the crunch of the French bread, this place knocks it out of the park. We ordered two bahn mi sandwiches - the pork shoulder and the pork belly. Both were delicious, but the flavor of the pork shoulder was exquisite. Sweet, salty, and sour, the pork shoulder bahn mi was the best of the duo.   The sandwiches were jam packed with filling - generous portions of meat and pickled vegetables. The vegetables were also picked perfectly - maintained crunch with every bite.  The French bread had the perfect balance of crunch and softness.  For coffee lovers, be sure to try the Vietnamese iced coffee - strong and sweet.   Please do yourself a favor and visit Bahn Mi and Ti to satisfy your cravings for delicious food - don't waste your time at any other bahn mi place in town."}
{"text":"Yes please! Awesome Bahn Mi and bubble tea. I had the drunken beef and it was delicious. Also a mango bubble tea that was very good.  The space is close but long. The service is friendly . I will be back."}
{"text":"I have returned many a time and am continuously impressed with their sandwiches and spring rolls. My favorite is the xa xiu! Quick friendly service, clean place and great food."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here, the staff were very welcoming and helpful. The place has a cool, modern look, very clean and inviting. The food was delicious!
