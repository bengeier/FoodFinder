{"text":"Tried this place for the first time when I came here to Arizona, I thought the pizza was pretty good it's a great bargain at $5. I have ordered it  several times and it always taste good. I think the cheese is good, it's always hot when I get it. Have not tried anything else there but would definitely recommend the pizza"}
{"text":"We stopped by for lunch because of the reviews. We had to try this place!  Hard to find because their sign is missing and felt like a hole in the wall. But...we are so happy we stayed to try this place out! The pizza is amazing! The sause is perfect! And the crust is fluffy!  Not to mention cheap! Youve got to give it a try!"}
{"text":"Some of the best inexpensive hand-to-hand pizza around !! All of the guys are super cool and courteous. We come here alot. Don't forget to order the \"Cinnasticks\" with frosting.....Yum."}
{"text":"So freaking good, that I literally downloaded yelp just to 5 star this place within 10 min of buying it! They don't skimp on cheese, higher quality than barros, but much cheaper. AWESOME place."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service , the people who work there seemed to enjoy their job very much and it really made the atmosphere feel great. The pizza was delicious, and the mozzarella meatball sub was perfect. Me and my girlfriend pigged out and we went home happy and satisified"}
{"text":"I love this pizza place!!! Everything is so tasty. Delivery can sometimes be slow but the drivers will actually call you and apologize and come as soon as possible. I hate e ordered here for over a year and will continue ordering from here on the future"}
{"text":"Oh my!! We eat pizza a lot. We are new to Arizona and hadn't found pizza that we liked. Today our luck changed!  We loved the pizza, wings and the spaghetti was amazing. Great quick service and friendly, considerate delivery man. We will buy again, and again, and again!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Everything is made from scratch and it being a small family business makes it even better. Everyone here is polite and very helpful, from the delivery drivers, to the phone people, to the cashiers. I come here almost everyday and I recommend it to all my friends!"}
{"text":"So i got some carry-out today from this local pizza shop. They had a deal going where each large pizza 1-topping was only $5 if you did carry-out. This is a perfect price point and the pizza was enjoyable. For fast, hot pizza at that price I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"This is great pizza at a great price. The sauce actually has herbs and spices that give the pizza a great taste! Definitely beats all those chain pizza joints. They have carry out specials and delivery. There are located in an old Pizza Hut and the parking lot is a little run down right next to the goodwill.  Don't get me wrong I've had better pizza but at this price range I haven't had any this good."}
{"text":"Tony over the phone was friendly // professional. Young man who delivered my pizza was also friendly.   Got a large pizza  Flavor.  Good  Crust.   Good  Cheese.  I read another comment mentioning it was somewhat rubbery. I agree. Don't get me wrong. It's decent right. and I understand that you get what you pay for and for 10 bucks including delivery I'm satisfied so. 5 stars for you. Granted. Some cheese closer to where the crust begins would be appreciated. Perhaps it's just me.  Good job guys"}
{"text":"I had a coupon and ordered food on special, wasn't aware I'm not supposed to combine offers but they allowed it this time and were very friendly about it! The food was surprisingly cheap but VERY good! 2 large pizzas, large salad, wings, and garlic sticks for only $30! Can't beat that! I would definitely return"}
{"text":"Tried this pizza place for the first time this past Saturday. Ordered for delivery. The person on the phone and the delivery guy were very pleasant!!! The pizza and wings on the other hand were ok.  For $7.99 the wings were skimpy and the pizza's sauce wasn't wow and the toppings for an \"ultimate\" pizza were lacking alot! I figured for a pizza that was suppose to have  quite a few toppings, I am not sure where they were but they weren't on my pizza. Might try it again but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"My wife and I were on a walk around the area and we stumbled upon this place. It smelled really good so we had to go in and give it a try. The customer service was excellent and the food was pretty tasty for a 5 dollar pizza. Their crust is actually really good too. It has a nice crunch on the outside but light and airy on the inside. This is definitely a step up from Little Ceasars 5 dollar pizzas."}
{"text":"Spotted this place randomly so decided to give it a try tonight. Got twi large pizzas and wings. Paid $20. For the price, it's not bad at all. Definitely worth it. Would I come here often and crave it? Probably not. The pizza was missing something and prefer the dough to be a little more cooked, the cheese fell right off it. Customer service was great! The guys in there were super nice. Will be back at some point since it's so close to me and love supporting small restaurants like this."}
{"text":"Pizza is great. Wings are great.Dough was fresh and delicious. BEST WINGS I EVER HAD.Quick and courteous service."}
{"text":"I been having pizza delivered for the last couple months. The driver would not offer me my change and would keep it. Well tonight I wanted yo see if was me or the driver getting it wrong( gave them one more chance).  To night I handed the almost the amount +$10 extra. The driver asked me it I wanted my chance back I said yes it was $10. A second later he told me I shortened him and did not give him a $20 only gave him $8. Told him to just take the pizza back.   Very unhapp"}
{"text":"I decided to grab two pies from here through Uber Eats. If you're good with doughy/bread like crust, hardly any sauce, and browned barely there cheese - you've got your place. Not a fan at all.  Only pros is that it arrived hot and quick. Other than that, I really cannot recommend this place. It's just bread with a schmere of sauce and sprinkle of browned cheese."}
{"text":"First time trying this pizza place and first impression was. The food was decent. Pizza and wings where done very fast but they need to improve on customer service at the front counter. The young man at the counter seemed somewhat lost and confused. When I ordered for pickup. They didn't ask for my name or phone number. So when I got there. He asked politely what I was there for? I told him I was there to pickup my order. So after a few minutes playing on the computer another one of his coworkers cane over to assist him. I told him and he said yeah it's ready and bagged up my wings and rang my order out. All in all I did enjoy the pizza and wings and probably will give them another try in the future. Hopefully the younger kid will be a little more helpful in his customers service skills."}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly  and helpful from the moment I walked in. Got my order in fast and the pizza was evenly cooked .. I highly recommend  this pizza joint. Price was another +. Cheap price for a great pizza."}
{"text":"Very close to my place, and they also deliver for those nights I don't want to drive to get my food! Such a great team they have behind the counter, always nice and make awesome pizzas! The mini Mia's are to die for(: definitely should check them out !"}
{"text":"Always a great $5.00 pizza! I'm from the east coast and this pie reminds more of home then most places in the valley. Staff is always friendly and loves local businesses."}
{"text":"Went there again a few days ago. We will never go back. One of the pizza makers had a cold. He wiped his nose with his hand and continued to make pizza. Manager was watching and did nothing. Walked out without paying or taking our pics and bread sticks."}
{"text":"i ordered the great delivery special and the pizza came hot. The toppings were fresh, the dough was cooked just right, not to thick and the sauce was tasty. Friendly staff and delivery driver. The only problem,, The cheese tasted like melted rubber bands and the more I chewed it the spongier it got lol!!  If they use real or fresh cheese they would get more repeats."}
{"text":"This pizza is delicious, I was very impressed considering how affordable it is as well. I never do reviews but I decided to do a review after enjoying this delicious food and dealing with such amazing employees. The delivery driver arrived at the promised time and noticed that part of my order was forgotten, not only did he go back and get my missing items, he also threw in a six pack or soda. Great customer service and I'll definitely be ordering from here again."}
