{"text":"The food was great and their service was awesome... only thing was we were sitting at the bar watching a kitchen staff member wipe their nose and then dish the food with his hands .. very huge turn off if your going to have an open kitchen to the public make sure your staff is aware people can see you..."}
{"text":"Food was good, decor was awesome but unfortunately our service wasn't the greatest.  First off, no one was really close by to check the main entrance and we actually had to walk in to get noticed but when we did a friendly individual greeted us and sat us right away. Props to him. After that however, our server seemed to be rushing and had no patience to tend to us. Knowing the service industry as we do, it doesn't matter how busy it is, there should always be time to answer questions. In this case it seemed like she just wanted to get to as many tables as she could. With our dietary restrictions we have to be careful in what we eat and if an establishment doesn't have the time to answer questions or demonstrate a lack of care in answer our questions, they will not get us as returning customer and we wouldn't recommend it if asked. We will continue standing by the 4th and Ramsey location but Kensington we will not.  I was tempted to give nothing for a tip but I couldn't in good conscience do that to the rest of the kitchen and staff because of one person. With every encounter my wife tried to be friendly and talk to our server but she seemed to not even care and at one point totally ignored one of my wife's compliments. Oh well"}
{"text":"Just to get it out of the way since you all know my animosity towards long queues for brunch: even though this place has the \"NoWait\" app, YOU STILL HAVE TO WAIT. Instead of the 30 mins (from when we put ourselves on the wait list), we shuffled awkwardly side to side at the entrance for 15 mins until we got seated. I'll take that as a win.  I'm kinda of surprised at how spacious this venue is. Bright natural light shines in from the big surrounding windows and there's ample distances between the tables so you can comfortably converse yet still food stalk.  I got a tad overly excited that I was able to have my morning tea in a periodic table mug (yes, I am a science nerd lol). Looking for something savoury yet sweet, I went with the Crepes la Quebecoise: bacon, apple and brie cheese. I was expecting cut up chunks of fresh apple, but it was more of a poached apple pie filling which was even better!  Service was pretty adequate considering it was prime brunch time, and prices are what you'd expect for Kensington ($15-$20ish/entree).  I wouldn't be opposed to checking Red's out again, obviously wait time permitting :)"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! Loved the prairie breakfast (subbed in the beef sausages). Good sized portions, and Cheez Whiz on the table for those who don't mind being judged by their peers. Only mistake we made was getting a coffee from across the street while waiting in line, versus just getting a freebie coffee inside while waiting. Definitely would visit again."}
{"text":"Went there this morning for breakfast... be got a burger that he liked.. I got the Kensington egg Benny and I didn't like that plate... I found the potatoes to be under cooked and the Benny to taste very strongly of vinegar... acabo coffee was great and our server was nice, but sitting at the bar with stools that don't move and between 2 manspreader made me feel like being on a plane.. stuck like a sardine..  We will probably go back for a different meal and try something else on the menu, but I won't come back for breakfast. Beautiful restaurant tho"}
{"text":"Just had breakfast here! Food was great, but the real reason for this review was our server Logan C, he was actually incredible, super attentive and had a phenomenally upbeat attitude, we would come back just for him!"}
{"text":"It's better than the one on 4th st but still pricy for what you get. Lots of space so ideal for large groups."}
{"text":"Great new location (open for three months) with all the great Red's menu items from their other locations. Service was prompt and friendly.  Unfortunately arriving after 2 on the day of the Calgary Marathon meant that they were out of all smoked meat products and crÃªpes. So we easily had the all day breakfast Blueberry Buckwheat Pancakes with fruit compote. These hot cakes are thick and full of plump juicy blueberries. You know they're good for you because you can taste the dense buckwheat flavour instead of the tasteless white bleached alternative. These pancakes are great anytime of the day....next a walk through Kensignton to enjoy the sunshine!"}
{"text":"I have been going to the Reds diner on 4th street for years. It's a wonderful restaurant, the staff are friendly and the food is excellent. The one issue with it(which isn't much of an issue) it that it's busy and can sometimes be a wait. So I was really excited when I heard they were expanding. I took my parents to breakfast at the Kensington location and It was every bit as good as the original! It's a huge beautiful restaurant! Still very comfortable and homey which is one of the reasons I love going there. The food is just as amazing! Lovely breakfast comfort food and big cups of delicious coffee. I love this place! and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Wow....very good service...line up was there..but had us fed in no time Amazing eggs benedict..we  had a traditional and pacific beni...washed down with a mimosa...yummm Any time is a great time for breakfast..use.the nowait app...fun place...great ppl"}
{"text":"I like this Red's much more than Red's in Ramsey.  The decor is much nicer, and dare I say the good is better. My Big Breakfast should have been called Giant Breakfast.  Despite it being very tasty, I couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"It was busy when we arrived, and we were put on a 10 minute waiting list. They left us to seats in the entry way with free coffee provided while you waited (classy). We had a booth within 5 minutes. The menu had lots of options, some which combined traditional breakfasts with treats like pancakes (yum)! I ended up choosing a traditional eggs and bacon breakfast and it was great. The service was good as well. Worth the visit for sure!"}
{"text":"I went to this place today. The only thing that is awesome here is the decor! I ordered breakfast and they served it with a slice of half ROTTEN pineapple! I will never go back to Reds again!"}
{"text":"Went here Sunday morning with my mom, sister, 6 month old, 5 year old, and boyfriend and it was a hit. I love a popular trendy place that still works for kids!!! The menu was so good, great selection, and the food did not disappoint! Service was a little slow but they were slammed so can't blame them. I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"We eat breakfast here almost every time we stay in Calgary. It is definitely worth the wait. The staff are friendly and the food is great. There is a nice variety and they even have a tofu scramble which is a bonus!"}
{"text":"WAITING LIST IS A JOKE, DON'T BOTHER, YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT LIKE YOU DIDN'T BOOK. The waiters inside were not very polite. They have a lot of people so they think they can treat customers like sh*t. Unacceptable, we left and will never even try again."}
{"text":"5 stars for Logan C, our server on April 14th! (Good Friday) it was busy but this guy was literally jogging around getting his job done! He always arrived at the perfect time with coffee and water refills! He offered recommendations and was very courteous at the time of billing to let us know about the auto grat! He's an asset to the business for sure. (Other servers I had there had an attitude or were very slow)"}
{"text":"This place has a few vegan options, but at least it has some. Lots of variety for breakfast options. I was not too happy with what I ordered which were blueberry pancakes. The serving was big, but the pancakes were not good, very dry. :(  The service was good, we were treated nicely. The decor was awesome!"}
{"text":"unskilled staff, such a long waiting time and it did not worth it at all. The food was okay for the price. Definitely won't be going there anymore! Also the space is not defined for a group of people."}
{"text":"It's a welcoming atmosphere and great attitude from the waiting staff. With every table filled they managed to deliver our brunch in a timely manner. Unfortunately, the hash browns were soft and soggy. The fruit slices added to supposedly spark the plate came out dry (grape fruit and orange), I do not and did not expect fruit to be on my plate but if it is going to be added onto my plate; maybe not leave it in the sun for an hour. The bread from the Benny was hard, eggs were poached perfectly and ham was nicely portioned. Otherwise! For the Red's Original; Eggs were fantastic, bread nice and soft. It was a good experience and I hope to be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon at 1:30pm, we were greeted as soon as we entered by a very friendly guy who seated us by the window. The waitresses are full of smiles and helpful tips on the menu items.   I had a tasty specialty latte with almond milk and blueberry basil goat cheese French toast. Hubby had Red's Original brekky with eggs, toast, sausage and hash browns. Generous portions and constant coffee refills through attentive service and a relaxed atmosphere made this a great experience. We will be back for dinner as the burgers sound fantastic with a half pound of sirloin and a variety of toppings to choose from...I'm so happy that Kensington is growing and taking hold of its identity with places like this one!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Calgary for the weekend, and were having a seriously miserable time (dinner with old friend who'd become a fascist, Air B & B with no AC and a crappy small fan...). Anyway, we were looking for a place for breakfast, and had earmarked another spot, but as we were heading out of Kensington, I happened to glance over and noticed this place was already open. We're early risers (even on the weekend).  We got to the other place, which had lots of construction in front, and it had just started raining, so parking was going to be problematic, and we'd have to run at least a block. So I suggested Red's.   It's nice and spacious, well-lit and bright from all the windows, cool and quirky decor, and our server was enthusiastic and friendly. We were able to walk right in and get a table. What more could we ask? Oh yeah...the food? Was awesome. I had the Quebecoise Crepes stuffed with apples and bacon, with a side of maple syrup. SO good, and so unusual! Hubby got a giant breakfast. We both had lattes, which were perfectly brewed and perfectly hot.   We even came BACK the next day because our first experience was so great! Once again, breakfast was spot on, service was perfect, and we were able to park right out front!   Since our old favorite, Nelly's, has become a bit of a joke in the last 10 years or so, we have a new favorite spot in Calgary!"}
{"text":"My friend and I attempted brunch on a Saturday and I used the NoWait app to try and avoid a long line.  By some miracle, not a single person registered on NoWait was there so we walked straight in to a table.  It was still really busy and despite this, our server was great.  My Rancheros Wrap was delicious and my friend enjoyed her Mediterranean Wrap.    I sincerely have no complaints.  If you're open to walking a few blocks, you can even find free street parking."}
{"text":"Plenty of yummy hollandaise made for an enjoyable Benny.  The hash browns are precooked and never crisp.  I went to another Reds and the ham was thin-cut, unlike the thick-cut in Kensington.  Same warmed hash browns though."}
{"text":"Had breakfast at Reds in Kensington this sunny Sunday morning.  At a little after 8 a.m., the restaurant was a not too busy.   We ordered the following: - French Toast with warm Maple Syrup - I had a taste.  It was quite good. - Breakfast Sandwich Special - Also had a taste, it had guacamole, lettuce, tomato, egg over easy on multi-grain bread.  It also came with hash brown. - Kensington Benny - different take on eggs benny -  soft poached eggs on top of spinach and English muffin.  The muffin was slightly tough to cut through.  The hollandaise sauce has pesto.   Different but tasty.  The sprinkle of balsamic vinegar on my Kensignton Benny tasted good.  Also came with hash brown - I liked the hash brown but found the burnt bits a bit tough to eat through.      Coffee was quite dark and I needed more Stevia to sweeten the coffee.    Wait service was good.  Parking is on-street."}
{"text":"They have a vegan option. I'm happy about this. The price is a little hefty. All I wanted to know was if the vegan scramble was hearty because if not I was going to choose another option. Instead what I got was a complaint that the minimum wage had been raised and that I should expect higher prices. I don't buy this AND I was asking about the portion of the food. It went from being about food to social commentary. I am a business owner and I DO NOT buy this whole thing about the minimum wage closing businesses. If your margins are that lean in the first place Reds perhaps you need to look at your business model. Every time I have come to reds it has been poor customer service. We waited an hour to get in here. A little patience on the part of your barista at the bar today would have been nice. By the way, I am celebrating my birthday today."}
