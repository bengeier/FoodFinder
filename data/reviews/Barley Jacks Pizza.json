{"text":"We are new to the area and have been looking for a good pizza joint. This place is awesome! I called to order a pizza for my husband to pick up on the way home from work. Told them what time he would be there and they had it ready for him on the dot.
The pizza is delicious, it's not flooded with sauce, the crust has a light crisp and you won't be disappointed in amount of toppings you get.
Prices are great and the people are great. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in a long time. Dough is tender, sauce is excellent. Kudos to the owner and staff -"}
{"text":"Wings weren't bad but the wait was horrible. After being told they had been dead all night, they said ten minutes. I watched the line cook grab my ticket. I sat in the waiting area for 24 minutes. Yikes!"}
{"text":"This is a tavern not a restaurant.We been there four or five times.I thought I would give my review.The food is pretty good.But the beers are over priced.Don't be in a hurry when you go here to eat.It usually takes an hour and a half.They share there kitchen with the pizza shop next door over.The pizza orders get made first before the tavern orders.And while your waiting for ever you will continue to drink beer that is very pricey.The service is not bad.Atmosphere is quite They need to turn the radio up and the heat.We have decided not Togo back for a year or so .Just saying."}
{"text":"I ordered the pizza and cheese bread special and wife ordered a sub over the phone for pick up. Was told 30 min, so we get there a little after 30 min to be safe and my pizza and bread been done just now putting the sub says will be like 10 min... not busy at all, now my food will be cold waiting on hers with way more time than they had said. Not coming back here anytime soon"}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing, breaded mushrooms fresh not frozen same with the onion rings! Very great prices, awesome customer service. Will definitely order again! It's worth the drive down from Lakewood!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just passing thru town on vacation.  Stopped here due to 5 star reviews.  Pizza was good, a little greasy, but took forever to get.  30 plus minutes and the girl who took our order forgot to put it in.  We ate in, rather than in the car.  We got no plates or silverware.  I would not recommend eating it in the seating.  They arent set up to eat in."}
{"text":"Best pizza!  Had the wings and burgers also and everything is delicious and tastes fresh. Service is also friendly. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Not very impressed and if this is the best pizza in Brunswick I'll stick to staying in Medina. Wanted something different and found good reviews about Barley Jacks plus the pics of the pizza looked awesome. Ya... Not so much. Phone order for 2 large pizzas. Nothing out of the ordinary and was told 25-30 mins. No problem. Arrive to pick up after 30 mins to give them time and paid, even threw in a tip thinking it was ready and that I would be getting prompt service...Told it will be ready in a few minutes. Few minutes turned into another 25 minutes standing there waiting, and waiting. 2 others behind me in the same boat. One guy even asked if they just put his order in the oven and I guess the girl wasn't lying because I'm pretty sure they didn't even start making it yet. I'm like \"ok, well it smells good. Better be the best damn pizza I ever had.\" Disappointment all around from myself, wife and kids. Ended up throwing in the rectangle Totino's pizza's and luckily had some wings going in the air fryer I just bought. They need to invest in another pizza oven or give realistic wait times. The crust is an upgraded version of the pizza I used to get in high school. Sauce was decent. Nothing special about this pizza and not worth the wait. If you're in a pinch and there just isn't any other pizza places open... I still would stop and pick up a Digiorno's."}
{"text":"Just moved in to the neighborhood,  thought we'd give it a try.  Pizza was very good.  Good sized,  plenty of toppings.  Definately a good pizza.  Give it a try,  you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Good quick food.  Awesome wings, ask for crispy and they make them crispy.  Pizza is simple but good."}
{"text":"We went to the pub side Nice little place staff is friendly.The food is good I have not had mushrooms like this in a long time ,but you have to wait a long time to get it . My daughter and I ordered breaded mushrooms and chicken wings . it took almost an hour to get them I also Ordered pizza to go and it took another half an hour., They share their kitchen with the pizza place next-door So be prepared to wait.If you're ordering pizza and having it delivered from Barley jacks Pizza it's good."}
{"text":"The service was excellent and the atmosphere was really laid back and clean. We ordered a cheese/pepperoni pizza, cheesy bread, and wings, which was all really good. The pepperoni has an awesome taste and the wings were really good! We were pleased and will be going back."}
{"text":"Barley Jacks is an amazing local place! The pizza is fantastic. We usually carry out so I don't have many notes about the service. Take out time is reasonable and I've never had anything messed up on my order. Wings are also fantastic! Only negative that I've heard is that the bar selection is quite limited."}
{"text":"I wish I lived closer to this place just because it is that good.  Their dry rub Cajun chicken wings are the best I think I have ever had. A co-worker recommended this place and I make sure to get it every time I am in Medina. My boyfriend is a big fan of their calzones and of course their pizza is delicious. Would definitely choose this pizza place over any other one in the area."}
{"text":"Updating to 4 stars...order the Barley Chips. You'll thank me later. This time I also ordered the Cajun dry rub wings...they are legit and nice and crispy. Delivery was fast and the food arrived hot."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in brunswick!we have tried them all....the crust is on point!flavor is great and the cheesy bread is cooked to perfection!prices are also good!will definitly be ordering  from here again"}
{"text":"Really excited that this place is doing well. We just started off by getting their pizzas and their breadsticks which is very good very fresh and they always are looking for feedback on their food. They're starting to expand on a more extensive menu including sandwiches which of them that we've tried I've been very good as well. Hopefully they keep evolving with a new exciting stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"Had to give this place a try last night. I like to support local places when possible and especially when it comes to pizza. 
I got the veggie pizza. It was delicious. The veggies were fresh the best part was the pizza dough itself. I could easily tell it was homemade it had a great crust that was both crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. 

I'll Definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Barley Jacks is very close to our house, so we thought we would give this local pizza place a shot. We ordered a basic pepperoni pizza and it was very good. The sauce was tasty and the crust was lightly brushed with a garlic butter sauce, which was a nice addition. The pricing is a bit more than your typical large pizza chain, but it's not anything crazy. We'd order from them again and are happy to be supporting a local business!"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 burgers and a dozen BBQ wings for delivery. Holy cow the burgers were awesome! Huge, juicy and delicious! More importantly to me, they got the order right. Everything we ordered was correct. The only thing I could say if I had to find fault would be to leave the yolk runny that I ordered on my burger. It was cooked through. But still really good."}
{"text":"New family owned and operated Pizza shop in Brunswick!  Best pizza around, good value, friendly service and quick!  Offer both pick up and delivery and the menu offers in addition to pizza, calzones, wings, salads and burgers!  My nephews love the french fries!  Try it :)"}
{"text":"Got the Hawaiian pizza and it was . Very friendly staff, and they have done a good job so far. Put a few more/bigger TVs in there and this will easily become my new local spot for Browns and Buckeye games. Give them your business."}
{"text":"We wanted pizza and wings, so we decided to try this place because it's right down the street. We were not prepared to like it so much.  We had the pepperoni, with extra pepperoni, supreme pizza. and both hot and barbecues wings.  Everything was absolutely amazing.  I will only order wings from there from now on.  Can't wait to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"We just ordered our first pizza at Barley Jacks.  It was a delicious large pizza with pepperoni and sausage. The sauce was perfect...not too garlicy or sweet.  The price won't hurt your wallet.  Very competitive with other pizza chains in the area.  We highly recommend this place for your next pizza order."}
{"text":"Food is AMAZING!!! But the employees suck. Was told the delivery driver got lost. I live 3 minutes away, and it took an hour & a half to get here. When I called to ask about my order I was talked over cuz the girl was to busy giggling & telling \"Adam\" to stop. She sounded either wasted or high. Delivery driver smelled like weed. 2 stars for the food but I am NOT shocked why they closed.  Find a better staff."}
{"text":"Tried the pizza and wings here and was really impressed. Pizza was delicious. Wings were simple, classic, delicious, outstanding. We will be back... soon."}
