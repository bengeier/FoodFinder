{"text":"We wanted to take my nephew to this restaurant so he could watch the planes. I checked the Yelp reviews before leaving so I really wasn't expecting too much out of this restaurant.

I was appreciative because the hostess did help us find a table near the window so we could see the planes. But honestly, that was the only positive.

Our food was just not good. My husband's plate had a giant hair (and it clearly wasn't his as he noticed it right after the waitress set it down and he has buzzed hair) in his potatoes. He asked for new potatoes but the waitress did have the mm make a whole new plate. My sister ordered a taco salad without meat and sure enough she had mostly meat in her salad. That was also remade. My nephew was only eating his fries, not his grilled cheese, and we kept encouraging him to eat the grilled cheese. I finally took a bite and spit it out. It tasted awful, almost as if the cheese was spoiled.

I will most definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"We decided on this place at the last minute after a recommendation from a local. It has a fun atmosphere, there are all sorts of model planes hanging from the ceiling which are cool to look at. It's right on the runway, which adds to the atmosphete.  The food was also excellent, we had the Caesar chicken wrap. They even called in an employee who lives nearby to speed things up. We will definitely visit again while in the area!"}
{"text":"After reading other reviews..I decided I should go ahead and voice my opinion of the place as well. I would never have thought it would cost $25 for lunch for 2. Couple of burgers, beverages and they charge for fries and onion rings. I can't recall anywhere I have been that charges to add on fries and rings. A bacon cheeseburger is $7.99 and adding onion rings brings ya to over $10. Rediculous! The burger patty wasn't even a quarter of a pound if that.  Food served warm, not hot :( The portion of fries is fair but 5 onion rings for $2.19? Cleanliness of the place needs work. Condiments on table dirty..ketchup empty etc. I would say Denny's has this place beat for quality and value.  When ordering with the server a customer should be informed of additional charges. Even though it says it at the BOTTOM of the menu.  You can say I would like that with onion rings, but they will just say SURE. No mention of additional charge. Thumbs down"}
{"text":"i've been here many times. the thing that sets this restaurant apart from others is the view. the restaurant is located in the small airport. you sit by large glass windows and have a clear view of the surrounding mountains and small planes that are coming and going. i go here on two specific nites. tuesdays & wed's.  tuesday, they have an all you can eat buffet. their ribs are very good and also on the buffet were catfish (a rarity on a buffet) and stuffed bell peppers among other things. all three of these are my favorites. buffet is about $9.00 . on wed's, this is an all you can eat rib nite, $9.00. the ribs are good. they give you plenty of sides, bread, soup, and a salad bar, all for the one price. i've always liked the food and service. i love the view. if you get there before dinner, there is an airport giftshop so you can look around and pick up a gift for someone. they have a full menu including breakfast and a kids menu. go for the ribs or buffet nite. either way, you'll get the ribs. oh yeah, they also have an old fashioned glass case that revolves holding big pies and big cakes. good stuff. they also have outdoor seating so you actually sit right along where the planes are parked and close to the runway."}
{"text":"I love that you can have breakfast and watch the planes take off and land and the food isn't bad either."}
{"text":"The Saturday and Sunday buffet is quite tasty.  It is all you can eat and well prepared.  The fruit is fresh and cut just right. The pancakes are light and fluffy ... Ahhh the Blintzes YUMMY!  I think I will go back tomorrow.  Thanks to the staff, it was very good."}
{"text":"About the quality you would expect from a Denny's but it's nice to watch the planes take off and land."}
{"text":"Staff sucks ignored our needs , seem to try and forget we were there. Food really sucked cold just tasted like jail food. So do yourself a favor don't come here read the reviews"}
{"text":"This place has gone into the gutter! Under new management, again. Service, food and management is horrible. Will this restaurant ever become what it was? 
To many restaurants to go and eat at. I will not ever return since I have been going for 2 decades! Unless you are there for the view of the airplanes! The city should take over the restaurant and make it a McDonald's, that way you will have a better experience with your friends and family's I would give this restaurant 0 stars!!! My group will not be returning"}
{"text":"Deer Valley with new owners served up the best liver and onions with bacon I've had in a long time. Their hash browns were the best in the city after asking for them really crispy. The service was friendly and fast. Sadly, they no longer have the baker for their deserts who did such a good job and I passed after looking at the selection."}
{"text":"Reasonable price for a good  breakfast. Great place to bring the kids they have lots of cool airplanes flying in & out.."}
{"text":"So far so gross. 

I brought my little girls to see planes and eat on Sunday. We opted for the \"buffet\". Almost no salad bar. The ham was old and floating in water which rendered it tasteless.  The eggs were overcooked. The home fries were well done, cold and hard. The chicken fried steak was OK. Pancakes were rubbery. For 10.99 a plate the food was subpar. If it were not for my girls being so excited over the planes I would give it zero."}
{"text":"I've been eating here since the early 90s, and it's never really changed. It's always been just average food. It was actually a little better when it was a greasy airport dive, because they didn't have to impress anyone. It was always full of grubby, hungry pilots. Now they've renovated a few times and their prices reflect it. We went there a few weeks ago so the kids could watch the planes. I got the buffet, which was alright. My wife ordered french toast and scrambled eggs. Instead of eggs there was some yellow, folded thing on her plate. She tasted it and said it was gross, so i just loaded up the scrambled eggs from the buffet and gave them to her. One decent thing is that they'll let little ones share the buffet with adults, so you don't have to buy a meal for them. It was still pricey for the quality of food, even with a coupon. My wife surmised that they charge a premium for the view. We'll stick with cracker barrel next time for breakfast. Cheaper and much, much tastier."}
{"text":"This is an airport restaurant, hopefully that is obvious from the name.  
I open with that sentence because there are reviewers on here (see the \"MIsteak\" review) that are obviously way too sophisticated for this restaurant and must have stopped by on their way home to an overpriced debt-hole in Snobsdale thinking they were at Ruth Chris.  
So, back to the restaurant.  
The food is good, but usually not great.  I had the breakfast buffet one morning and thought it was great, but every other visit has just been good.  
The food is just part of the experience here. 
This restaurant is located at the busiest general aviation (general aviation just means no scheduled passenger service) airport in the country.  For aviation geeks like me, this place rocks for a big reason - there is a deck above the restaurant that has speakers playing the real-time exchanges between ATC and the pilots.  I think that is neat but, like I said before, I'm a huge aviation geek.  
If you want a restaurant with entertainment after the meal, try this place out."}
{"text":"I was there today for lunch and had the steak and eggs with my family.  I really appreciate the courtious server Megan and her timing with making sure we are taken care of with our meal and drinks. The food was great, my steak was done right and hot. I Wil go there again. They have prime rib dinner that is really good and fabulous. Thank you Megan your the best."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years.  They have always had a good fish fry on Friday evenings and a decent breakfast. I really enjoy coming here during cooler weather with family and watching planes fly in and take off while we relax and drink a little coffee."}
{"text":"Food was good and the service excellent, will have to bring Grandbabies here when they come visit !!"}
{"text":"If not for the aircraft landing and taking off, you'd be crazy to eat here.

Prices are about the same as Denney's.
Cleanliness, really needs to be improved.
Wait Staff, isn't very efficient. 

Apart from the menu, they do offer a Sunday Breakfast Brunch."}
{"text":"Cool place. Great chicken fried steak and their omelets are tasty. The staff was so friendly! Went there on a Saturday morning and had a nice time."}
{"text":"Close by so its very convenient for a good meal.  Its also a great place to relax and watch the planes come in.  The meal are nice in size and the price is right!!  Give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Since the restaurant changed ownership, the quality of the food has dropped dramatically.  We went for the filet mignon special, and found out they don't have that on the menu anymore.  As we were already there and hungry, we choose four other entrees..we were all disappointed.  The best part of the restaurant is the view...but not enough for us to return again."}
{"text":"Just plain and simple a great place to eat and enjoy your surroundings."}
{"text":"Went in for a late night birthday dinner for my boyfriends mom and family. Great food and excellent customer service! Megan was top notch! This place is a quiet little gem. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Will never go back! Stopped in for breakfast the other morning five minutes to get a menu and a cuppa coffee the two waitresses were more interested in the two men sitting in a booth on the other side of the restaurant. Ordered eggs Benedict what they brought me was not. The menu said eggs Benedict but that was not a holiday so whatever it was was terrible. Do yourself a favor and stay away"}
{"text":"This is for the fried chicken entree. There are very few decent restaurants in north phx and the airport has always had a decent breakfast and lunch. The same cannot be said for the $16.45 half of light fried chicken. The size of the of the pieces would hardly pass for a quarter at most places. I really like the restaurant and will be back, but not for supper."}
{"text":"Unlike other posters we have always had good service.  We don't do the buffets-not really their thing and they should stop.  I would also avoid the salad bar.  The food is below average but not awful.  You could kind of say it is a Denny's type diner.  If you are looking for fresh and healthy this probably isn't your place.  I go there for my indulgence once in awhile of chicken fried steak.  Our kids really like it because of the airplanes.  It is more of a thing to do then a place to eat.  We go 4-5x a year but would never make it a regular thing.  I think if they improved food quality and spruced the place up a little bit they could have a real gem.  If you want hamburgers or other diner food not a bad place..They also use canned veggies-I don't think Denny's still does that.  They should use frozen or fresh-don't understand why they don't."}
{"text":"Really, really nice people!! The scenery is better dern cool but man, it's so dull and lifeless in there. It feels like you're eating in a place from the 70's and the food taste like it. Bland, my goodness so bland. 

I was debating between on ordering the California grilled salmon salad or the chicken Caesar pita. Our lovely waitress said if you're not super hungry and don't want leftovers over the Pita. I went with the Pita. I should not have! It was so dern bland!! 

My friend orders the BBQ steak sandwich, pretty taste but way too much BBQ sauce. It was supposed to feature 2 huge onions on it, it didn't. Our lovely server got us 2 very hard,l and overcomes old onions rings. She meant well I'm sure, they all did but just go someplace else if you're not flying out of that airport."}
{"text":"Service was good.... The food??? I think I've had better hospital food. I was not impressed in the least!!! Bland.... Blah!! Portion size was ok. 
Needless to say, we probably won't be back. 2 stars is generous."}
{"text":"I'm an aviation nut and I LOVE airports.  I just need to learn to not eat at them.  I give this place high marks for the service, and their menu is so \"punny\" it's painful (yet amusing) to read.  And, they have about 100 small model airplanes hanging from their ceiling......reminds me of the room I dreamed of living in as a youth.

The breadth of their menu is amazing.  Burgers, countless sandwiches, chicken fried steak, regular steak, about 10 different types of fish. (really?  fish?)  Do you think they fly it in?

The one thing that all the dishes have in common is their mediocrity.  Just really, really not good at all.  My bun was dry...the meat reminded me of the frozen patties you can buy at Costco.  Judging from the looks of horror I saw on the faces of our group, I was not alone.  Two members of our party actually ordered fish dishes, to my disbelief.  Brave souls.

So, sorry DVAR.  You are my first \"2 star\" rating.  I really DID want to like you."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a number of times over the years.  Clean enough, friendly staff, fun location.  I'll be glad when they inevitably go out of business, though.  The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all.  I give the other star for the location.  They have outdoor seating when it's nice out, you can sit and watch the planes take off and land.  Fun stuff.  

This could be a great place, once they get ownership who's willing to throw all the recipes out the window and start over from scratch with higher quality food.  If you have to eat here, try a special.  If you wanna go to check out the airport, maybe try getting coffee.  They're busy at lunchtime.  I will willingly eat their breakfasts, that's about it."}
{"text":"We went here for Father's Day this year. It was busy but we were seated rather quickly. This place is amazing with the ambiance , food , and wait staff. The wait staff is friendly and helpful. Always making sure of what we need. The food that was ordered was fast and delicious. The two of us who had buffet's , the buffet's were yummy and had a wide selection of breakfast food. I can't say enough of how great the food and people are there. It keeps us coming back for more."}
{"text":"Had breakfast there today. The pros were the service and the view. It was cool watching the planes and helicopters taking off and landing. The servers were also very helpful and friendly. The food was average. Something like I would expect from a chain breakfast joint. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Here's the deal - I live nearby and often walk over with my young son for breakfast...he loves the planes and I get some exercise. Now I have read all of these reviews and know exactly what and who each person is commenting on - it's funny because I have felt the same way on a few occasions! 

Go there for a breakfast special of 2 eggs, bacon, hash browns & toast - all for under 5.00 bucks - order water & watch the planes! That is it!! By all means DO NOT order anything else on that menu!! DO NOT eat the numerous buffets, fish frys, prime rib, or any other coupons specials they entice you with - YOU WILL REGRET IT! Nasty!

Again, the best and only value is the cheap two egg special and watch the planes with the kids (I'm lucky because my boy like the special too) ...anything else here is a punishment.

PS - The service seems to have gotten a little better lately .... however, it was so bad before, just stopping by your table now seems like a blessing...It's a shame - this place could be soooo cool if they just tried a little..."}
{"text":"Bonus star for the airplanes.  The weekday buffet had a huge variety of A-OK food.  For the price I was happy.  After we ate we went onto the roof to watch planes takeoff and land.  I agree with Daren C., its worth visiting at least once, more than that if you work nearby."}
{"text":"The ambiance: Fun for kiddos but the tables, chairs, and dining room were a bit run-down
The service: Friendly and attentive
The food: Decent with medium-size portions

I think we are a bit spoiled by Wings at the Fullerton Airport with their newness, quality food, smaller dining area, and \"right on the runway\" ambiance. But, this is a larger airport and a larger restaurant in a different state so I probably shouldn't compare them.  Deer Valley Airport Restaurant was suggested by a friend who loves to take her kids to watch the planes take off.  We ventured over with 3 adults and 5 kids (aged 1-4).  The dining area was about half-full for lunch on a Sunday, and we were encouraged to choose our own table.  We opted for a large booth that could have seated about 8 people to leave room for the wiggly kids and highchairs.  Our server was attentive and service was not necessarily fast or slow.  She did check on us about 2-3 times after we ordered and received our meals to see if we needed anything else for the kids.  

For the food, as you could imagine, we ordered several kid's meals.  Mac and cheese seems to be Kraft and the grilled cheese is standard fare.  I ordered the \"Deer Valley's Favorite\" burger (meat, cheese, bacon, avocado) with onion rings and bbq sauce.  Sadly, the avocado was not ripe (which may be fine with some, but as an avocado-snobby Californian, I think they could do better) and the side portion of onion rings was small (about 6 small o-rings).  The chef salad was also ordered and seemed standard fare as well.  

You can go up to the top-deck above the restaurant before or after you eat to watch the planes take off and listen to the air traffic controllers.  A neat feature but, perhaps, not during lunchtime in August.  

Overall, it is a good place to take the kids, but wouldn't probably be good for a date night."}
{"text":"I was so hoping the food here was going to be good. I had a coupon for the filet mignon ($10.00 add $200.00 for salad bar) When I ordered it the guy said, \"let me see if we have any. \" I was like, \"are you serious or are you just kidding?\" No, He was serious! So before I ordered it I asked if he was a steak man and he said he was. He said the filet mignon was big, thick and it melts in your mouth. 

It was far from thick! It was a thin slab of meat, but it most certainly was not a filet mignon! I could get a much better filet mignon at Outback any day of the week. 

He also told me that I didn't need a coupon, that is the price on the menu.  So I don'e get it? I cut out the coupon make sure I come at the right time to use it and I didn't even need it anyway.

The salad bar was horrible! 

One good thing is outside Santa came in a helicopter to greet the kids! The line to get to sit in his lap was about an hour, but worth it!  Had it not been for Santa, it would have been a BUST!!

Blessings,
Fay"}
{"text":"We keep going back because our son loves it.  Loves to watch the planes take off and land.  Beyond that not sure why we go.  Most of the food is low quality frozen processed food, not much fresh here.  Avoid on a Friday night.  The fish buffet reeks really bad.  I would for sure stay away from the salad bar.  One time I saw salad literally floating in water.  We often to have send something back because they didn't micro it long enough and it is cold.  The service has always been decent.  I've noticed over the 3-4 years we've been going there the numbers dwindling.  A little updating a revised fresher menu and that place would be hopping."}
{"text":"We had the opportunity to take the Grandkids here for lunch. My Mom's new friend used to be a pilot and he was picking up the tab. Nice!

This place has a lot of history going on. Tons of planes hanging from the ceiling, planes taking off and landing outside, an observation deck on the top floor and a restaurant menu that will give almost anyone a nice option for a meal.

The food here is probably not the best feature of this place. I would have to agree with other Yelp reviews and say that it is the action and excitement from all the planes outside that give this place an A-OK rating.

Looked at all the photos of the food before coming here. Some looked better than others. Decided to keep it simple and go with the Triple Decker Club. The sandwich was pretty good but the fries were cold and soggy. My wife ordered the Monte Cristo and later told me that is was nothing more than some French Toast made into a sandwich and was not very appetizing.

My Granddaughter went with the Macaroni and Cheese kid's meal with some fresh fresh fruit. She really enjoyed her lunch and chowed it down very quickly. Our Grandson got the kid's version of a Cheese Burger. It was a small pattie on a full sized adult bun. Looked like they just threw something down on a plate and brought it out.

My mom is on a special gluten free diet and they did go out of their way to cook her a special meal. I laughed as it arrived and saw her tilting the unseasoned burger so that the puddled grease on top would drain off to the side. Her boyfriend ordered the Denver Omelette with Hash Browns. I could not see it with all the glare from the windows but it looked HUGE!

Don't get me wrong on this review. By all standards we had a fun visit watching the planes from the window and getting to enjoy time with the extended family. We were surprised at how busy they were and the the place was packed.

Great place to bring the kids and maybe get a bite to eat. The desserts did look really good as we walked out of the restaurant. Maybe that would be the best thing to get when coming here. Who doesn't like getting jacked on sugar and then running around in circles? COPY THAT ... HOUSTON!

2.75 STARS"}
{"text":"When we arrived around 3pm the place was pretty deserted. We asked to site outside so we could watch the planes but were told do to a recent storm, the tables and chairs were damaged. 

We ordered a couple kid meals and they didn't come with drinks. The staff was accommodating and was able to give sauces on the side. 

I got a burger and it was just a normal burger. Nothing to write home about but it served it's purpose. 

I heard an older couple complaining the  potatoes were not seasoned and overcooked. The staff also accommodated them without questioning. 

They have tons of model planes hanging from the ceiling which is a pretty cool feature. Overall the place was just average and only gets a three star vote from me."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite restaurants. From the outstanding service to the fantastic food-every tome i come here i enjoy my expieience. The omelettes are to die for and the prime rib on special thursdays and sundays is some of the best iv ever had. I would recommend this place to anyone, and the best part is the free entertainment watching the planes and helicopters. Its a great place to take your kids or just sit and have a meeting. Next time your thinking about trying something new you should definatley check out the deer valley airport restaurant."}
{"text":"I love to come here for breakfast on Sunday's after I run a 5K race. Love to watch the planes on the back patio. Buffet isn't that tasty though. The kids like it but I am not a fan."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this restaurant years and years ago. I was a student at the Deer Valley airport, and eventually a flight instructor as well. It was a great location with awesome views. The food was always descent the the service was great. 

Nothing too exciting, but a great place."}
{"text":"Nice place to have weekend breakfast buffet. Wish we had been here when the kids were younger and would've enjoyed the atmosphere. Only complaint is that they don't have flavored coffee creamer."}
{"text":"Our family of three came in today around 11:00-11:50 am megan was our waitress, she was awesome ! Very fast service but also an awesome personality thanks megan!"}
{"text":"Was good. Had steak and eggs with home tatters. It's a lot of food. I would split it. Flavor was good. Service was good. All good here."}
{"text":"I don't really come here for the food.  It is not bad, but it is not anything to write home about, however, during Christmas, it is such a fun time to see Santa land on a Helicopter, my twins go crazy.  I will probably have a couple more years of \"believe\" time, so I need to milk it.  It was a little crazy, but well worth their happy little faces.  My little girl keeps telling everyone now that Santa is \"really real\" because she saw him and touched him.  She actually almost mugged him, she was hanging from one of his sleeves, almost taking his bell.  I will definitely come back next year."}
{"text":"Server Nadia was very good, a hoot to be around. She has a lot of spice and humor. Fairly attentive and very appreciative. 

Food was decent; quality of what you'd expect at a diner. The salad bar was just ehh okay. I would avoid it to be honest.

Burgers are the best thing to order here as they are fire-grilled I believe and taste great. I ordered one of their specials, the Macho Burger which had sliced jalapeños, guacamole and pepper jack cheese. Cheese wasn't good but the rest was great! 

Sweet potato fries were good, not great. 

Atmosphere is cool because you're able to watch the planes take off and land."}
{"text":"Our bill for 2 including tip was 32.00, for that we got food out of a can.  Canned peas, canned gravy, thick slices of deli style turkey meat and very salty beef stroganoff that seemed like the recipe made with Campbell's soup.  The dark chocolate cake was the best part of the meal and we split that.  
But, seriously...canned peas as the vegetable?  Canned gravy on the hot turkey open face sandwich was not even seasoned.   The $2.00 extra for the salad bar was a waste, again just canned stuff still in the liquid with slotted spoons to serve with.  The lettuce was mostly ok, with some brown on the ends due to being out all day uncovered.  
The waitress was nice and friendly, but I could spend $32.00 and get much better and fresher somewhere else.  I just don't see the attraction to this place, unless you like waiting and watching planes take off."}
{"text":"My sis and I love this place. Great food at a good price. Can't beat their steak specials. The servers have always been fast and nice.  The salad bar has a nice selection too."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible food. I asked for the steak salad done medium. Only a very small portion of the steak was cooked properly and there were tons of slimy lettuce leaves. I didn't expect much from this place but it disappointed even more. My husbands fries were undercooked and they ran out of Mac and cheese for my son. The service was kind of weird, not the best and by the end of the night one of the bus boys was sleeping in one of the booths. Only reason we went here was because we were in a rush. Would never come here again except for soda (which was flat) and maybe the dessert."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is GREAT and the Customer service is excellent. Owner Robert Dare is professional and very friendly. If you have children fun place to take them..they have planes hanging from the ceiling all over the restaurant. My son and I go every Wednesday he loves it and I love the friendly atmosphere. Hope this this helps \"Bon Appetit!\""}
{"text":"Wow this place sure has changed. Service was not good at all. Menu has changed and no longer serve an airport restaurant staple, corn beef hash. 
Food was not good. Hard to screw up a scrambled egg. Asked for dry toast and came out soaking with butter. Waitress started arguing with me that I didn't ask for dry toast until she looked at my order. 
I was surprised how empty this place was as it had always been pretty full for breakfast. 
Will have to find another place for breakfast meetings at DVT. Would not consider returning."}
{"text":"The location (airport) 4. The view (airport) 4. The 50's diner feel a 4. Good service. But the 3x I ate there, the food was a 1 or 2 at best. And no bar. Thus a 3 total sounds about right. Still recommend it at least once for its uniqueness though."}
{"text":"I have been coming hrre ever since i was 4, i have to say that the food is ok, not the best, but not exactly bad. The hamburgers are also ok they fall apart a bit, but thats fine. Just dont expect high quality food, ots airport. Though one thing for you to be aware of is that it does seem a bit disorganized, and there is a weird set up whem you enter.

But over all it is a good place to eat simple food and watch the airplanes take off and land"}
{"text":"My daughter likes this restaurant because of the planes. However, last week we went for the breakfast buffet on the weekend and had a very bad experience.

After getting biscuits and gravy from the buffet I found a long hair all in my gravy when I was back at the table, I literally didn't want to eat anymore. I went up to the buffet again for my child and saw they had either added more gravy to the pot or switched it out. This all happened after we had been given our check and our waiter never came back after I found the hair, which is fine, we were almost done and it was busy. When I went to the counter to pay I was asked how everything was and I told the woman, who's always the cashier there about the hair.  She then asked me if I told the waiter and I explained that he hadn't come back. 

I understand this is a buffet and the hair may very well been from another customer. However, it was the total unprofessional manner in which the cashier chose to act that actually gave me a bad experience.  She continued to act as if everything was my fault because I didn't notify my waiter and she continued to lecture me about it without apologizing for the situation or offering anything to make it better. She left a worst taste in my mouth than the hair."}
{"text":"Ok so this place is small and looks like an old diner/restaurant but it's so good. Every time I go I get the chicken tenders and I can't get enough. I go back there just when I'm in the mood for good chicken tenders. The fries aren't the best, but also good. Everyone I've been here with hasn't complained about the food, from the breakfast to country fired steak they are yummy!"}
{"text":"We went here on Sunday to have their prime rib special. It was decent, just needed a dash more salt.  Overall our experience was enjoyable. The staff was very friendly and helpful, especially with my 2 year old nephew. They gave him some crayons and paper to keep him preoccupied =).  The staff checked in on us pretty often which was nice.  My friend had their pecan pie and she said it was really good. And if you like planes, there are a slew of them hung on the ceiling which I thought was really neat! I think we'll probably come here again since its so close."}
{"text":"In all honesty, the people who rated this place 1 star because they ordered steak and fish at a small airport restaurant deserve a slap to the back of the head. Of course the steak, fish and seafood is going to suck. Come on people. You're at a SMALL AIRPORT RESTAURANT. This isn't Mastro's, nor is it Sky Harbor where you can actually find modified versions of fine dining restaurants. 

This place is average. Not terrible, not great. Average. My boyfriend took me here on a Friday night because he knows how much I love airplanes. It was a really cute idea. The place was for the most part empty, aside from the glassed off section of the restaurant that was filled with senior citizens who seemed to be attending a seminar. The only thing about going at night is that the windows of the restaurant have a massive glare and it is very hard to see the planes outside when it's dark. 

Service is so-so. She came, took our drink orders and came back to take our food orders. My boyfriend got the grilled cheese with fries and I got the club sandwich with sweet potato fries (add $.99). The food was decent. The grilled cheese, though, was remarkably small. The fries that came with it were obviously the frozen wedge kind but my boyfriend will eat any type of fries, whether frozen or not. My sandwich wasn't bad. My only complaints would be that the tomato was a bit too ripe and the meats were cut a bit thick. Nothing you can't work around though. The sweet potato fries were actually REALLY good. They didn't seem to be the frozen kind and were cooked perfectly and had a great taste. Both items came with a large pickle spear as well. The prices were somewhat okay. The grilled cheese was around $5/6 and the club sandwich was $9.99 I believe, plus the extra buck for sweet potato fries (worth it!). 

So. Long story short. Don't come to this restaurant expecting a five star steak. You won't get it here. But if you're looking for a casual restaurant setting with food similar to a Coco's or Denny's type, come here. Plus you get to watch the airplanes, and look at their hundreds of model planes hanging from the ceiling."}
{"text":"Dear God, I felt like Gordon Ramsay on \"Kitchen Nightmares,\" although I didn't say the F word out loud and storm out. I was quietly appalled. My husband and I both ordered the filet mignon. The steak was a MISsteak as my husband eloquently said. It looked like it was run over by one of those planes outside the window, then left in a bush, wiped off, heated up, and THEN served with canned mushrooms (ack!) and wrapped in what was some sort of mystery meat ... bacon? The \"vegetable medley\" was two carrots, two broccoli florets, and the rest were stalks. Obviously from a can. My husband's mashed potatoes made him scared. Literally. He said they tasted like \"a trip to the ER.\"
The salad bar tasted of despair. What was really weird was that the family seated next to us was raving about everything. Maybe they just came from Sizzler.

Overpriced and underwhelming. Even if you are IN the Deer Valley Airport, go across the street to Culver's."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch. Good place to take the Grandkids. Good prices and the cook does great!"}
{"text":"I had heard that the food here was great but I am afraid I cannot go with that review. The food reminds me of a roadside diner. It wasn't bad but there wasn't anything stand out about it. I am hoping someone will suggest a specialty that I can go back and retry because I really had high hopes. I had the chicken gyro and my kids had burgers. The burgers were fine but the gyro lacked any type of ethnic flavor. It's very American diner food stuff."}
{"text":"Fun place to eat!  Really enjoyed the chicken fried steak. Only one server was working (Max) and he was somehow able to be attentive and juggle all the tables.  The view is also incredible.  Had a beautiful view of the mountains and saw a plane get towed off that had made a gear-up landing earlier in the day."}
{"text":"We ordered coffee and pancakes. The coffee urns were horribly filthy. Not exaggerating.  One of them looked like it had been dropped on a pizza and it had dried like that. The other had crud and milk looking splatters on it. The joints of the coffee urns were packed with crud. Truly.   The waitress was argumentative with us when we brought it to her attention. I watched what she did next. They were not put in the dirty dishes. She was using a white towel to rub them down.  Creepy. What was that white towel used for?  Anyway, it's a fun location but I can't tell you how many times we have asked for clean coffee cups or silverware. We will never return as these problems are due to lazy management and I for one don't want to become ill with a food-born illness or disease like hepatitis."}
{"text":"A great little place serving diner-like grub while you watch the planes takeoff and land. A fun place to take kids. Prices are reasonable. Always kept tidy. Can get a little noise when full."}
{"text":"Cool decor, awesome view of the runway, outstanding wait staff.

Food is pretty basic. Burger was fine, no special touches, just a burger. Fries were... well, fries. Not sure they do anything particularly well.

Back to the decor. Most amazing model airplanes hanging from the ceiling. I could spend all day looking at those things.

The wait staff; Darbi is the best, she just kills it but in all honesty, they all are just amazing. 

Stop by to watch planes land and take off, check out the models and be pampered by the staff."}
{"text":"The location is awesome, but they don't have good service there, at all.  multiple times we've sat there waiting for someone to take our order, and no one comes to us."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is lots of fun but the food is another story.

With a 3 star average on Yelp I wasn't expecting the best but was aiming for ok food. I was here many years back and the food was awful then but I heard about new ownership so I thought this place might be worth a try.

You walk in and see maybe a thousand model airplanes hanging from the ceiling. Then you pass by a retro salad bar similar to the ones from those budget steakhouses. They have a case packed with nice looking desserts. The back wall has large windows so you can watch the airplanes take off and land.

I ordered the grilled flat iron steak. My dinner came with a loaf of soft wheat bread and salad bar. The salad bar had lots of items that were fresh. Nothing I picked was bad or bad tasting. I was happy enough with the salad bar.

My Grilled Flat Iron Steak arrives and looks pretty good. But I had a hard time sawing through it with my steak knife and really needed something stronger like a jack hammer. Thank God I still have my real teeth because if I had dentures they'd be in the trash from damage occurred from trying to chew through that meat.

Thank GOD I asked for the gravy to be served on the side because it was THICK and LUMPY like RICE PUDDING. The gravy was so unappetizing looking I had to push it away from me because it looked like vomit to me. 

I do note the mashed potatoes and bell peppers were both good and that was a surprise. At least I had something to eat.

My husband had the chicken fried steak. He was able to eat his but complained to me about the thick lumpy gravy and corn that seemed like from frozen.

Our waiter never checked on us.

I was thinking about dessert because they did actually look good.

The waiter just dropped off the bill.

We paid and at that point the manager asked us how everything was and I didn't feel like getting into it at that point so I just said ok.

I might give them another try in the future because of the location and fun atmosphere but not any time soon."}
{"text":"Came in around 430pm on 6/5. First time visiting. Food and prices were great and our server was awesome! Probably some of the best customer service I've seen compared to alot of restaurants in the area. My kids really enjoyed watching the planes coming and going. We will definatly be returning in the near future:)"}
{"text":"We all make mistakes, its part of being human.
Only some people learn from their mistakes while others don't.

Well if you know someone in your neighborhood like this, one of those priceless Darwinian gems whose mugshot routinely shows up on the 10 o'clock news, the guy or girl who you suspect is selling dope to all the kids on your street, I strongly urge you to recommend this place to them. 

Not because I want to gawk at them in the next booth. I don't.
And not because I think they deserve DVA restaurant's outstanding breakfast and lunch specials. They don't.

It's because this place draws law enforcement officials like shit draws flies.
And they don't even sell donuts!"}
{"text":"I like this place for breakfast. The buffet is pretty good. They have all the breakfast favorites including corned beef hash, scrambled aggs and chorizo, french toast, home fries, biscuits and gravy, etc... Price is not bad for $8.99 a person. It's always busy and the service has been pretty good. They have two large dining rooms and can accommodate large parties and private groups. They also have a very extensive pie and cake selection. You can order pies for the holidays. It's not a fancy place but the food is good and the view of the runway and planes is a great change of pace!"}
{"text":"Pros:
-View of planes coming and going on the air strip
-Cheap & decent food (by \"decent\" I mean Denny's type food)
-Interior looks freshly renovated
-Very casual

Cons:
-Servers seem a bit busy

(We both ordered club sandwiches w/ fries)"}
{"text":"Another bad visit today...
Again BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!

Waited WAY to long for our breakfast, which was a simple order of eggs (etc) for three of us.

When we asked our Server to check on our order, she was discourteous and seemed to accuse us of not understanding how busy they were.

When our food finally arrived, no toast, which came later.

Not coming back."}
{"text":"Sign said please be seated.  I did.  2-3 mins later a couple did at the table adjacent to me.  I wasn't served, or even acknowledged.  They had drinks brought, and ordered.  Nothing for me.  Waited 15 mins, figured what the hell I'll watch the planes.  The waiter came to them 3-4 times, never to me.  I grabbed my jacket and left.  I'm not going to wave my hand and beg to be served, especially since there was only 3 tables with people in my area, including me.
Blah, not worth it."}
{"text":"Chicken fried steak  was  greasy and  was kinda a gainey taste  mash potators  were  like old been siting for awhile    peas  were dry   salad was only thing good but still  could of been better  havent been here for years  and i so remember why  friends had prime rib and it was very tough and cold    dont think i will be back    sad the food has always been this way"}
{"text":"As a pilot, I've been eating here since the beginning of time, or so it seems!  Voula just sold her business to some new owners (Mary Ann) from Canada.  Voula and most of her staff (Donna & others), always did go out of their way to make you feel welcome and to make sure you left happy!  This is an airport/neighborhood restaurant.  If you love a decent meal, around an airport theme, then this will work.  Because of my involvement with aircraft and RC aircraft clubs, I eat here 7 - 11 times a month.  No, it's not always perfect. No place is!  But if you want some usually above \"average\" meals, make sure you check this restaurant out!  And their separate room for group meetings, is THE \"Go To\" place for many organizations, including 2 that I'm a part of on a monthly basis. Thanks Voula...Best Wishes!  And Good Luck to the new owners, Mary Ann!  I'll still be coming in...."}
{"text":"Great wifi. Cool airplanes on the ceiling. The lobby next to the restaurant is great for casual business meetings. It is a little on the pricy side for meals. The view of the runway and planes is nice. 

It seems to always be busy during lunch. I will be going back."}
{"text":"DVAP....

You have to go at least once in your life. It really is a neat place with alot of history. 

The service is great, it appears to be family run. 

The food is good. Better then Dennys but not as good as Mimi's. 

I had the all u can eat of beef ribs, lasagna, meat loaf, cat fish, chicken, mashed and diced potatoes, stuffing, rice, homemade apple pie, etc and salad bar. I know I am missing a bunch of stuff they had but you get the drift. 

They run specials on Prime rib and stuff so you might want to call to see what they are serving the night you go."}
{"text":"Nestled in the heart of the North Valley you will find the Deer Valley Air Port.  It is a quaint little airport for non-commercial traffic.  There is a variety of aircraft on display and little propeller driven planes are constantly coming and going.  This what the romance of flight is all about!

Now imagine, if you will, a charming little restaurant with an aviation theme amidst this backdrop of mountains and planes.  Complete with outdoor dining and an observation deck to watch the planes taxi and land.

Sounds like a nice place, right?  Sounds like you'd have to work pretty hard to #&ck up a place with that much natural atmosphere and beauty.  Right?

Well they did!

The food is crappy and the service is non-existent.  The price is right in line with Chili's, Friday's, Applebee's, etc.  But the service is way off the mark and when I saw the all you can eat fish buffet I almost barfed.

In order to get the attention of our wait staff I had to stand by my table and wave my arms violently as if to take flight, and scream \"MISS MISS MA'AM MISS HEY LADY YO MISS MA'AM!\"  She saw me and tried to duck away.  Finally when I left the table to track her down, other patrons prevented her escape - all I wanted was silverware, napkins, a straw, and some condiments for our table as they make eating the food she just dropped off much easier.

No one ever came by for refills on our drinks.

THE BOTTOM LINE:  The intrinsic charm of the airport can not be beat but skip the restaurant.  Go to the Subway across the street and take your sandwiches to the Observation Deck at the Deer Valley Airport.  You'll pay less than half as much, get better service, better food, and you still get all of the romance of flight."}
{"text":"Their Fried Chicken is just awesome! Try the Chicken Rice soup on Sunday's as it is the best i've had. Great food, great service, great location. This is a must go restaurant that has great food with a great atmosphere for the whole family. They have a great viewing space outside for watching planes. My kids love it. They are great with kids. The staff and ownership know and say hello to people by first name so they must have a lot of regulars. Bring the kids. I even saw a huge private room for big parties or events which is always nice to know."}
{"text":"Was there this past Tuesday. Lets just say that the manager was extremely unprofessional and until things change I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I have had several people tell me about this place and how wonderful it was! Unfortunately my experience was awful....very terrible customer service, very scattered and confused. It was not busy...There was ten tables in there and two servers...Lori served our toast first without the over easy eggs....we waited at least ten minutes for our eggs and by that time the toast was soggy and not hot. I ordered a side of avocado with my eggs and she forgot  and it took her time to get that....My hash browns were crispy like I asked but we're freezing cold like they were left out of the heat lamp.  We were a group of nine and I understand that will take time but she had no idea who's food was what and her timing was off. She was trying and carried all of our food out four plates at time and the other server just sat in the back And didn't help her at all! Very disappointing, great view of the planes taking off but terrible service. I won't ever be back."}
{"text":"Decent food, great prices!  Staff is friendly.  We go there to see the planes take off and land. My son loves it. Desserts are delish. There's always a coupon to be found online for the food. I'd recommend using one just in case your experience isn't great."}
{"text":"I've eaten at DVAR before, but didn't remember much about it. Went last night with my son and boyfriend. It's pretty average. I would stay away from the salad bar. It was a very bare-bones type of affair. The soup was tasty, not at all like the canned stuff that they usually serve at diner places.The prime rib was a bit fatty, but the leg of lamb was superb. I would go back just for that."}
{"text":"Was at this resturant on 8/4/17 @ 11:30am to meet with a friend, watch planes, relax and chat.
Our food was good. Service not so good, the waitress Marbella seemed to be mad because she had to work on Labor Day ,
Well just have to say it was not the customers that made her work on this day.  She did not smile once, or make friendly conversation to make us feel like it was a good choice for us to be there. Not saying she had to party with us just being a little friendlier would of been nice. Oh yeah , I have had to work on holidays but did not make the patrons feel they were not welcomed in anyway.
Hopefully it will get better."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for breakfast or lunch especially if you enjoy small planes.  The burgers are REAL burgers, not those 1/4 inch pressed cardboard things!  I LIKE 'em!!!  It's a cozy place and has a nice large room that can be reserved for parties or meetings.  Parking is not a problem.  There are lots of pies and cakes, too, if you have room for dessert!"}
{"text":"My family loves this place... Big portions, fantastic food, not a lot of salt, and a great relaxing way to bond with family and friends.  We watch the helicopters and planes take off and land and the out side space, upstairs or down make it really exciting to be that close to the action.  The new owner has brought in a liquor  license  for those of us who like wine or a beer ... double the pleasure. He also has a new awesome menu and is replacing the old serving sets with all new as well. If you want a special and different place to have good food  and entertainment for great prices.. This would be it! I'll be coming here more often and I highly recommend it! They also have a private room for parties or business at great price's so I'm going to book a suprise party when the temp's go down a bit.. I know It will be fun!"}
{"text":"I've always been attracted to airports. I love that you can watch the planes land and take off while dining. You can also view the colorful hot air balloons and the beautiful Arizona sunset while eating supper at the Deer Valley Airport Restaurant. The food was ...meh, but the company and view spectacular.

I'll be back."}
{"text":"Dear Deer Valley Restaurant,

Please add the following to your ingredients list. 
1. Salt
2. Pepper 

Thank you.

Sincerely,
Our taste buds

Food was bland, clam chowder had the consistency of mashed potatoes, had to ask for my soup after wandering around the buffet for about 5 minutes looking for a kettle or something. Buffet area was disorganized, not well lit, and needed a good cleaning. 

Will give breakfast a chance."}
{"text":"Literally everything about our meal was awful. Service was awful ... I ended up re-filling my own soda, obtaining my own condiments, etc. after multiple requests to our server. The salad bar was disgusting, dirty and the fixins looked old, canned and low quality and tasted even worse. Desserts were in a spinning case like you would see at a greasy spoon in the middle of Nebraska and looked like a 5-year-old's cooking project. Chicken was dry, ribs were dry, everything was dry and tasteless. And, no alcohol. Not even beer! The bill was dirt cheap, so the damage was minimal, but still don't bother! There are plenty of other restaurants, including Taco Bell, that are far better in the vicinity."}
{"text":"Absolutely love their salad bar. I used to just go for my networking groups. But when we moved closer I have started going more often. Was supposed to find out they also have a breakfast buffet on the weekends. Also fun to watch the planes while you eat."}
{"text":"I don't see the need to ever go to this place unless you are flying in or out of the Deer Valley Airport and you just got off the longest flight in the history of flights and there was no food on board.  The buffet is just kinda gross.  They advertise a fish fry on Wednesdays and Fridays, but I don't see how they feel confident standing by their advertised fish fry.  It's just kinda gross.  The fried cod was too breaded and the fish didn't seem fresh or prepared right.  The lasagna was good, but not worth revisiting this place for.  I also sampled the shrimp cocktail (which was ok, but may have given me the shits), fried shrimp (bleh), fried chicken (ok), their soups (weren't very good), chocolate cake (crappy and stale tasting), rice pudding (barely ok),  and the table bread was fresh and nice (so stock up on that shit).

Oh, and not a fan of their salad bar either really.  Sorry Deer Valley Airport restaurant (although really I think you should be apologizing to me), but I'll never be coming back."}
{"text":"Damn shame.  After meeting here for @5 years, the quality of food has dropped to an unsafe level and the management is simply disappointing.  I have spent thousands of dollars here but after my experiences with the Kitchen and Management, I'll never go back.  Really, a damn shame because the venue and location is really nice."}
{"text":"We came because of a restaurant.com certificate with a group of 8. I had grilled chicken which was the special and it was the smallest, driest piece of chicken I've ever had. My baked potato was very old and dry. My husband ordered New York strip and it obviously wasn't that. It was tiny and over cooked. The folks in our group who ordered something fried seemed happy with their food but beyond that or a burger the food is sub par. I guess there is a reason that we were one of only 2 or 3 parties in the entire place. I had been there long ago but won't make that mistake a 3rd time."}
{"text":"My family just had the Easter buffet and it was OUTSTANDING! Fresh scrambled eggs, french toast, sausages, fresh fruit, etc.  All just plane good. Wait staff was friendly and efficient as always. One waiter we haven't seen in almost a year and he remembered us. We sat outside so the kids, teenagers, could watch the planes go by."}
{"text":"Great place to either fly or drive to for classic FBO food. Sunday breakfast before flying to Fullerton for lunch."}
{"text":"Food was just decent.  Nothing to write home about.  Pretty cool they have the planes in the background though"}
{"text":"The only  good breakfast buffet's  I've had are connected to 4 and above star hotels,come in at over double the price and usually have to dress up better than you would do here. 

Entrance was chaotic and it took time to work out who was going to issue a number for the queue which looked formidable yet we were seated in under 10 minutes.   

The buffet was a mixed-bag of good for the type food and phoning it in.  The corn beef has is institutional and tasteless without assistance , the breakfast potatoes were not greasy , gravy was good enough to embarrass the biscuit.  Pancakes decent, hot  syrup a nice  touch, and fruit selection fresh enough.  Service was good for a  full-house  and they drop off a coffee pot for you  which probably explains why it's good, e.g, get your own food and drink. 

Barring the planes I wouldn't go out of our way to eat here but you can't divorce them  from  in this case.  Like 2 for food +1 for location."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places for breakfast, especially on Sunday morning. They serve the BEST huevos rancheros in town. Service is great and prices are unbeatable. I saw a number of people criticizing the restaurant for the steaks or other evening meals. Can't comment on other meals but the breakfasts are the best around."}
{"text":"i've been eating at the Deer Valley Airport Restaurant for the past several years and have always enjoyed the great food they serve. 

Over the past few years I've also been allowed to hold my 101 Referral Network Meetings in one of the many conference rooms they have for my Phoenix group every 2nd Tuesday of the month. The service is always excellent and the Management is always very accommodating. 

I also love watching the planes take off and land when we're eating as well as enjoy checking out the hundreds of model airplanes that dangle from the ceilings in every room of the restaurant bringing back some of my childhood pastimes of working on model airplanes. 

I would highly recommend eating at Deer Valley Airport Restaurant!"}
{"text":"I see a slight upgrade in the food...heck with the decor--it's now 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Came here for a meeting of the Working Dog Club of Arizona.  Accidentally left my purse and didn't realize this until I was across town.  Called and spoke to Brittany and confirmed it was still there, sped across town again to pick it up.  Arrived about 20 minutes after making the call.
Was pleased I was able to get my purse back.
Was NOT the least bit pleased to find my payment for a previous day judging assignment had been depleted by 20%.  Hmm.  Now who would have done that?!  Thanks so much for staying there so I could retrieve my purse.  A small compensation would have made its way into my hands had there not already been money missing.  Who knew they had a \"finders fee\"?!
Extremely disappointed since this club plans to meet at this location monthly.
I will be making a call in the morning.
Will also encourage the club to put further consideration into meeting elsewhere."}
{"text":"Just sat down and asked for waffle and huevos rancheros. Busy place here and been a while since myself last here. Food looks good. 
My chow came pretty quick and is excellent. Apparently a handmade tortilla. Nice. I'll be back"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of buffets in general, so I ordered from the menu.   The omelet I got was no better than what you'd get at waffle house.  The service was pretty good, but the waitress seemed a little stressed even though it wasn't that busy.  

I love to go here, because I have a 2-year-old that loves all things aviation.  Being able to watch planes take off and land while you eat breakfast is a fun experience.    The food and service could be better for what you pay."}
{"text":"Great place! We had to wait a little bit for our food, but it was worth it! I had chicken fried steak & eggs & the gravy was wonderful & very well seasoned! The steak was tender & crispy on the outside. Loved the home fries, wonderfully crispy. My husband had the BBQ burger, which was very moist & delicious. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Average food, but generous portion sizes. Nice atmosphere though to see all the planes take off and land! Our waiter was SUPER NICE and very attentive. Even though I wasn't amazed by the food my first visit, I'd give it another try because I liked the location :-)"}
{"text":"I eat here at least one Sunday a month with my family starting this year. We come here for brunch, get the buffet it's yummy and a great deal $11 adults $5 kids. The buffet has a salad bar, bacon, ham, sausage,  pancakes, scrambled eggs, French toast, country potatoes, hash, fruit preserve for topping and other choices. Plus you can order toast (white, wheat, sourdough raisin and English muffin ) also you can order eggs (over easy/medium/hard). They also have a menu that has tons of offerings like huevors rancheros , omelets, ect. They have tons of seating asking the back windows so you can enjoy watching planes and jets take off and land while eating your meal. Again I love this place, kids will love it. It's a great place, check it out. I have been enjoying breakfast/brunch here for over 25yrs."}
{"text":"the place was clean .Our waiters where nice but service wasn't so good .The food was horrible .If you go for the experience your safe if you order a drink or dessert but the acuall food is horrible ."}
{"text":"Very good food and great service.  The menu has a great variety and I especially enjoy the daily specials.  The prime rib special on Sundays is my favorite, always tender and cooked to perfection.  An interesting place to eat as well with aircraft taking off and landing.  I highly recommend for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"I am not one to totally trash a business, because I understand that once in a while even the best run business can have a off night, but I can honestly say this was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had, and I have no problem at all posting my review. 

We went there for the \"All you can eat fish Fry\" only because we saw an ad and had coupons. While it was a buffet, it was not \"all you can eat\" as the food was not replenished enough. The food was cold, and they didn't have your typical \"fish fry\" dishes like cole slaw, french fries, mac and cheese. Instead there was a horrendous selection of lasagna, some sort of stuffed pork dish, stuffing, gravy and some sort of pudding item for dessert. 

On top of all that, the staff was rude. We had to wait for 5 minutes for the cashier, who when she finally cashed us out didn't ask us how the food was, or engage in any sort of pleasantries. 

Stay away from this join, far away."}
{"text":"Good food and great view!"}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying I am not super particular about my breakfast joints.  To me, breakfast is breakfast.   But this place did not hit the mark.  When we got there it was packed,  which is always a promising sign.  We ordered standard breakfast fare, waffles,  eggs, bacon, and coffee.  The coffee was probably the worst cup I've ever had.   The food was greasy and tasteless.   My syrup pot had smeared butter and food remnants all over it from the last diner, but they still brought it out to me.  The coffee carafe was filthy.   I couldn't hardly stomach eating much of my meal, and couldn't get out of there fast enough."}
{"text":"Great place for kids or aviation fans. My 3 year old son enjoyed a pancake in the shape of Mickey and devoured two slices of bacon. I enjoyed a vegetable omelet but the home fries stole the show. Overall, a fun experience."}
{"text":"Great local breakfast spot. The customers are a mixed crowd of mellow people. The staff is always nice. Great place for a business lunch or to bring the family. There's a patio which is perfect when the right nice. The restaurant sits next to the runway. My husband and I love to watch our three year old son watch in amazement as the airplanes and helicopters land and take-off."}
{"text":"I come here often and this is my first review ever. I've always enjoyed the food and the atmosphere here (planes/air shows, aviation theme, etc) and its a great place to take the kids. The food is good not great but good. The service however is sub-par and \"always\" hit or miss. It seems like there's never any sense of urgency to run food or get it out quickly. Denny's does a better job when the place is packed! Don't get me wrong, the servers are all very nice but man, seriously, get your act together. Learn how to prioritize food and get some chefs that are quick or hire more staff to accommodate a large house full of hungry people. I will give another review that's more positive once the service improves."}
{"text":"Met with a friend here yesterday afternoon.  We got there after 3pm and most of their specials had ended already the there were a few that ended at 4 but was very limited.  Spaghetti or patty melt.  The server was great but the menu was a bit pricey.  They did have a breakfast buffet which we missed out on but everything seemed to cost extra with the melt.  So we just settled for the melt and fries.  I  enjoyed it but $10 for a burger and fries seems a bit pricey to me.  I did enjoy the planes as did my friend and this was his first time here.  So that went well.  Would return no problem however I would try to time it for the specials."}
{"text":"They used to have great Prime rib, we went all the time but last night it was horrible."}
{"text":"We periodically dine at the Deer Valley Airport Restaurant solely to watch the planes take off. The first time I went there I wasn't expecting much from the food but I was pleasantly surprised - it's not the best but it's not bad. The restaurant has the feel of a 'mom and pop' diner. The servers are always friendly and pleasant although service can be a bit slow. With that said, we are never in a hurry when coming here and always manage to get a front row seat at the runway so slower service doesn't bother me. It's a great place for a leisurely weekend family brunch. Kids love this place."}
{"text":"I normally like this place... I looked up somewhere to eat fish today and saw they have a \"fish\" buffet.  Came in sign said seat yourself.... Sat ourselves.  Then the waiter got mad and flipped the sign around and no one came to wait on us for 10 minutes.  After he turned the sign around there were SEVERAL people just standing there waiting to be seated... They all left"}
{"text":"What a cool place to eat and watch planes do their thing. Pro tip: bring your food, enter through the main entrance of the airport and enjoy your food outside by the runway. My food from the restaurant buffet was barely luke warm and the prices are very high. The worker were pleasant enough and the place was reasonably clean."}
{"text":"What every you do don't come here for the dinner buffet, my goodness do they even look at it after the lunch crowd. Seriously it was nasty. What I gather was meatloaf was gray, the popcorn shrimp was all but dust, the broccoli had been there steaming so long that it turned to mush and the tarter sauce had a top layer of yellow. At 12.95 it was a huge waist of money, When we told the waitress she said she had not looked at the buffet, that's wonderful and when we told the manager she took off 5.00. Yeah right like we are coming back for that mess, photos attached, yikes"}
{"text":"We had the worst breakfast & service ever this morning. I ordered a two egg breakfast which came with bacon, home fries and sourdough toast. $9.50 for cold eggs and burnt to hell home fries. The home fries were so burnt that I felt like I was eating a plate charcoal briquettes that had been marinating in a grease trap. And to top it off $8.25 for a Bloody Mary with zero garnish. Two tablespoons of vodka and the rest was zing zang (supposedly). My mom ordered a bowl of oatmeal which was over $5 for 1/2 cup serving and she was the last to get her food. Haymaker blows this place out of the water. Grab some egg McMuffins and a blanket and sit in the grass by Luke Airforce Base for a true and cheaper experience."}
{"text":"We have a breakfast meeting the second Tuesday bi-monthly. The last two meetings it has been very frustrating. We had 26 people two months ago and over 40 this month. One waitress was assigned to handle the complete group. It was a disaster.
We complained to the manager and he came out and took a few orders which helped but not a lot. The waitress we had was doing her best but was totally overwhelmed. A lot of the group went and got their own toast as it was never delivered.
Had the food been warm it would have been delicious. We like coming there for breakfast but one more time like this will be a problem."}
{"text":"We had another enjoyable meal at the Deer Valley Airport Restaurant! This was our first time eating the prime rib. It was very good, especially considering how affordable it was! I highly recommend the larger cut. I got the smaller cut and it was good. I wish I would have gotten the larger cut because it looked even better and I would have had leftovers!

Our kid had a grilled cheese and fries. It was not small like someone else pictured. It was filled with plenty of cheese. He ate every bite even though he said he wasn't hungry. Their fries are very good! They are different than those pictured. They had a coating on them. We like their onion rings too! 

We were there about 4:30 on a Sunday afternoon. It wasn't too busy at that time. Our server was very pleasant and attentive!

There was lots of action on the runway which adds to the enjoyment of our meal. There is a lot of outdoor seating. The weather is getting nice and we will sit outside next time AND order some more prime rib!"}
{"text":"So this is a place, with food. That much cannot be denied. But you know what? It's a small airport restaurant, and if you're flying in for a $100 hamburger, then a $100 hamburger you can have. And patty melts. And salads. And whatever other Sysco-type delights you might expect. (It was even prime rib night when we were there, but as it was 20 minutes til closing time, I thought better of it.)

I had a perfectly reasonable patty melt myself, and I enjoyed it. The service was really nice, and the views out the window of the evening traffic on approach were phenomenal. Plus, *tons* of model airplanes hanging from the ceiling in the dining area, which was a fun touch."}
{"text":"This was our first visit for breakfast. It was unusually busy according to the staff. Although the place was crowded the staff was great! Seated us by the window which was just what we wanted. Food was hot and good. Very nice quaint place and very friendly to everyone. They made you feel like you were a regular. We will return to try other dishes. Loved the views and the observation deck."}
{"text":"If you like to watch airplanes while you are having breakfast, lunch or dinner then this place is for you. I was there today after not dining there for a long time and the restaurant was packed and it was loud. I joined two friends for lunch and I admit t is nice to have a view of the runway and planes taking off and landing since  like airplanes !

I had the gyro sandwich and it was good as usual. I find it kind of pricey at $ 8.89 for the sandwich only. Sides are additional. 

The menu is quite comprehensive and I like the fact that you can have breakfast all day. The wait staff is always very courteous and efficient. They run many specials and there is also a salad bar.

Why only three stars...? I find the restaurant to be kind of pricey!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love going to this restaurant. It has such a family feel. The staff is always upbeat and amazing. My parents love eating there when they come to visit. The food is amazing, the people are great, and the ambiance is retro fantastic. Love it there, and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Typical diner setting. The food definitely  fits in under the quality curve.....service was average."}
{"text":"I have been going hear since I was born. My family and I have developed a bond with the staff here and I always feel welcomed here. The restaurant has a good atmosphere that fits the concept of a airport. They have these nice plane figures hanging off of the ceiling all around the restaurant. You get a nice view of the runway for the planes so you can watch them take off or land. I absolutely love their French toast. The only problem I have with the food is the bacon at the buffet could at times be over cooked."}
{"text":"This place has really changed. My toast was cold and the butter hard. Hubbys hamburger bun was stale. Fries were cold. New menu has less choices and higher prices. Used to be one of our fave places but we won't be going back."}
{"text":"I hesitate to include this restaurant as one of my big favorites, but the truth is I eat here probably 15 times a month.

Located at the Phoenix, Deer Valley Airport.  It is a fairly big airport restaurant.  Food is fine, but the location and the people are great.

Especially for kids or people interested in airplanes."}
{"text":"Good old fashion american diner type restaurant.
the $10.99 small prime rib special is a pretty good place to start
it's not Ruth Chris, but it is a pretty good meal for a reasonable price
salad bar is usually a 2dollar add on. And, worth the 2 bucks.
pasta, various beans and bean salad, cheese, and all of the most common salad fixings. they have a specials menu on their website that shows what to expect for the month. I have never been disappointed with breakfast. All of the normal diner type choices available. Desserts are all house made and good. Pie and coffee.. with a great view of the airports runway. Maybe skip the spaghetti or some of the fried food. Like Fried Chicken, as the cooks could use some training on overcooking and temp control. even the quality of the chicken itself left plenty to be desired.
But, the chicken fried steak and gravy happened to be pretty good.
The service has always been very good..
 
Give the Pepper Steak a try if it's on the specials menu for the day..
Best thing I've had there.  It, was excellent...."}
{"text":"New to the area so trying different breakfast places. Got a coupon for this restaurant so wanted to try it. The atmosphere is great - 5 stars - watching the small planes and helicopters. The decor is great too with model planes hanging everywhere. Unfortunately, the food is average, at best, and the service was slow. Portions were also average. The bacon is really thin, not crispy and not very tasty - only 2 pieces too. I had ham and it was thick cut and pretty tasty. Read about the potatoes but mine were under cooked and were just ordinary hash browns. The biscuit I ordered was dense and tasteless. The orange juice seemed watery as well. Conclusion:  Too many other places to try so won't be back here."}
{"text":"Great soup and salad bar. You can upgrade the s&s to all you can eat for a a few bucks more. $9.99 total. 

Salad bar packed with many items, fresh and full. 

Artichoke hearts, radish, macaroni salad, Greek olives, 3 bean salad, ham, chicken, turkey, onions green and purple, garbonzo beans, kale salad, potato salad, chips and salsa, sunflower seeds, many dressings.

So refreshing and delicious.

Soups always so tasty!"}
{"text":"Amazed that this place stays in business.  Well, maybe not.  People like to look at planes sometimes, and I suppose that any sort of food & service will do as long as you can look at the planes.  Then there's the airport employees who don't want to drive somewhere for lunch, and of course the pilots who need something convenient.  And I'm not sure why, but a lot of retired folks seem to frequent the small airport restaurants such as this one.

Food was mediocre diner breakfast food.  My server could barely hear, had a raspy smoker's voice, and seemed to ignore me on several occasions.  I inquired about the omelette vs. the pancakes, and the reply was basically whatever you feel like.  So I ordered the omelette and then was immediately told that the pancakes looked good today.  WTF?

Prices are high for what you get - you're paying for the view of the planes, not the food."}
{"text":"Angus burger was good. Atmosphere is nice.  Lots of model airplanes and memorabilia.  A really nice airport restaurant."}
