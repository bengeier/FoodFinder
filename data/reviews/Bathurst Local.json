{"text":"This place is great. The friendliest service for which you could ask, delicious drinks and food, and a very cozy atmosphere. The French toast grilled cheese and smoothies make for a great breakfast and the Bathurst blackout is the perfect way to put a long day behind you. Did I mention the prices? They're through the floor! I'll be back here as often as I can manage."}
{"text":"Cute place. Small and dark, and only had grilled cheese on the menu but it was amazing! Good beers too, they take credit not debit"}
{"text":"Super cheap beers ($4.70!!), good music, and friendly service!  I dig the self-serve model, antique decor and chill atmosphere.  For whatever reason, it's kind of empty heretonight for a Saturday night - people are missing out!  Just a tad bit too dark here though - it looks like it's closed from the outside!  Would def recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I feel this place is aiming for a very select group of 20 something hipsters, which is fair enough considering the location. The cocktails are very true to their original form, which is nice, but the wine and beer selections are poor."}
{"text":"Great price for some great drinks (and potent to say the least). The bartender is super friendly and chill."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's very chill, but not in a run down hipster way. You could take a date here as well. They have an awesome drink list, I love The Walker. They also have grilled cheese sandwiches as well! Get there early and get their awesome window table. :)"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a low key place to enjoy some great whisky or beer and just chill, then you've come to the right place.   The owner is friendly and enjoys talking what spirits he has, and it's a place that any adult would enjoy."}
{"text":"Since my original destination was closed for a private party this past weekend, I figured it would be a good chance to check out this 'hidden gem' of Bathurst Local. The first thing that I (didn't) notice was that there is no marquee name outside, only a small sign in the window, so I almost walked right past it. It was not quite what I expected, not really a bar or pub in the usual sense. It's more like an old-fashioned private club where you can meet for drinks and conversation, but no cigars. Inside was rather dim, and I also noticed that each of the 6 hanging lights was a different style. There is also a curio shelf with books and pictures, and 2 wooden cabinets that display the various beers and other drinks available. Once you know what you want, you place your order and pay at the window at the back. The very pleasant server explained of all this to me when I came in. It's a fairly small place with seating for about 2 dozen people, and quickly filled up after I arrived and remained so until I left.  Most of the beer choices were unfamiliar to me; I gather they are all local craft beers. I had a bottle of Vermont Blond, along with the grilled cheese sandwich that is the only food item on the menu. The sandwich was very good, served on a bed of potato chips with a pickle spear on the side. There was also a list of the specific cocktails available, including one that was appropriately called the Bathurst Local. My beer and grilled cheese was $11; beers are priced around $6 while cocktails are around $7. Overall, a different experience from the average night out, but still enjoyable."}
{"text":"Truly a hidden gem, as much as I didn't want to disclose this place I just had to. Corner of Bathurst and Dundas Local is a quaint, low key, dim, intimate, quiet place where it's all about sitting down and catching up with company in a non pretentious atmosphere. Drinks are reasonably priced and they don't cheap out on alcohol. Ambiance is lovely with some chilled out indie music in the background, it's truly a haven for relaxation in this bustling city.  They've got a small list of STRONG cocktails with each its own distinctive characteristic. Each priced reasonably at $7-8 Jen had the Manhattan, and Aviator cocktail  I opted to try their Stay Gold cocktail  For food, there's only one thing on the menu, yes. Grilled cheese sandwich on a bed of potato chips and a pickle on the side. Only $3  Overall this place is awesome, great to catch up over drinks"}
{"text":"I needed to kill time one evening before meeting a friend at Bent and wanted to find a place nearby to have a drink. I almost missed this place when I first walked by since it looks like a store front. Inside, it's adorable with inexpensive drinks: $5 for a glass of house wine. It's self serve by going to the back of the bar and ordering. The wine list is limited (only one white). It's so adorable and chilled that I am willing to overlook that. Would be a great date spot."}
{"text":"Hidden gem with a good vibe, reasonable prices and delicious food!  The server was very friendly and had a good playlist of tunes going in the background.  This place knows how to do business. They keep it simple and it works!  Thanks a lot for a fun random Tuesdat night!"}
{"text":"a friendly spot to discover new local beers in a welcoming atmosphere. great crew. they do an interesting layout where you can see the drinks available in certain spots in the interior. so you dont have to peer behind the bar. also the owner Glen is very knowledgeable and awesome."}
{"text":"Went here one Saturday evening on the recommendation of a friend, and loved it. Friendly staff, excellent atmosphere. And damn, that was some good grilled cheese."}
