{"text":"This is a sandwich shop not a gourmet restaurant so arrive with appropriate expectations and you will leave in love! I call ahead for take out here often. I love the gyro! Loaded with perfectly delicious meat plenty of tzatziki sauce and fresh veggies. The onion rings are the best I have ever had. Now don't get them if you are on a diet! I love this little place and want to help them stay in business! Give them a try!"}
{"text":"We live down the street from this newly opened restaurant and we are glad it opened. The food selection isn't great, but it tastes great and comes at a good price. If you want to eat cheap, do yourself a favor and give it a try."}
{"text":"Delicious casual Greek!  First time there, got the regular gyro with fries (hubs got same with onion rings). Gyros were big, hearty, and flavorful. Fries were SO good (onion rings were great too). We'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place... The menu is a mix of american and some greek. The gyro's are pretty good and the various burgers / subs are great... I can't say that I have too many complaints. The only complaint that I have is the \"bulk frozen\" onion rings... You can sit there and watch them make up your food and they pull it out of a store bag in their freezer and put it into the fryer... They taste fine, but maybe some handmade ones would be a good improvement. Also the interior has a little left to be desired but other then that I have never had a meal there that I regretted! Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Honestly the staff was very nice. The restaurant was clean from what I noticed. I order the falafel gyro to go, it wasn't bad but definitely not great. The tzatziki sauce was truly unimpressive and tasted like sour cream and some diced cucumber mixed together. The falafel was dry as was the bread the gyro was served on. Really had high hopes that this was going to be a somewhat authentic Greek restaurant, but it's really more of a sandwich place."}
{"text":"I frequent this establishment a lot and so does most people in my neighborhood. We recently had a discussion in my neighborhood facebook group about this place and we all agreed (which does not happen often). The food is absolutely amazing. No matter if you order the wings, the Gyros, the burger, cheese sticks, fried, onion rings or even the Philly cheese steak. It is all really really good.  My only complaints are Food taking a long time to get, I call ahead for this the dine in decor showing more of a take out appearance.  Other than those two things I highly suggest eating there. I think the owners are the cooks and will often hand deliver the food to your table as they are proud of their dishes."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! My fiance and I ventured on Valentine's Day while trying to avoid crowds. The restaurant is extremely clean, and the food came out relatively quickly and was good!  The decor is minimal, but tasteful, and the staff was all very nice. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE! Called my order in and still waited a half hour because the clerk forgot and it sat under heat lamps! Definitely lost a customer!"}
{"text":"Good food, Good quantity, Good prices...Nuff said! Straightforward and simple, just like Mr. Geero!"}
{"text":"I had a delicious gyro and Greek salad. Service was great. Very friendly. Next visit, I want to try the fish gyro."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service, all for a reasonable price.  I liked it, but I don't know that I would go far out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"Food quality and flavor - top notch, second to none. The regular gyro meat has amazing flavor.   Why the low score... Service, service, service. Prior to this week, it was almost always the owner working and he was always friendly and professional. We've been twice this week and the three new female employees were working both times. First time, the meat was dry, as if it had been leftover from the previous day and microwaved. Tonight, they got our takeout order wrong - charged us correctly but wrong food.   When I called to have them fix it, we were placed on \"hold\" (she put the phone down and continued to have a conversation with the other employees..). After 10 minutes I hung up and attempted to call back. It took an additional 5 minutes for them to finally hang up the phone. When I got through, I had to repeat myself numerous times because the female on the phone kept talking with another employee.   We have been debating whether it is under new ownership. Either way, I don't forsee us supporting an establishment that is run in this manner."}
{"text":"Owner is Very friendly.  Super clean resturant.  Food was very good.  Authentic Greek Gyros.  Would recommend for families with children.  Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Can't complain- excellent gyros and salads. Everything is always warm and fresh. Great spot for quick dinners. Definitely call ahead for takeout."}
{"text":"Great food. The Greek salad with grilled chicken on top is great. I have also gotten the chicken pita, hummus & your choice of normal or seasoned fries. I have never gotten a bad meal."}
{"text":"Food is delicious! You will have to wait longer than you want, BC they have no employees. We don't let that deter us though BC the owners are very friendly and they have excellent, casual food. The salads are delicious, great gyros, excellent chicken and regular Phillies, tasty wings, and the best fries - seasoned (like curly fries) and regular."}
{"text":"I live just down the street from Mr. Geero. My family and I decided to give it a try and I am so very glad we did!!! I had the Philly Cheese steak and fries. The sub roll was very soft, the cheese, steak, onions, peppers, and mushrooms were perfectly cooked. Normally I don't rave about French fries cause well, they are just fries but, these were hot, perfectly salted and most importantly crisp! My mom had the Greek salad and she said it was just as good. The lettuce and feta were fresh and the dressing was homemade. My dad had the original gyro and said it was fabulous. All and all not one complaint! The owner came up to speak to us and he was super nice! He gave us some Baklava and invited us back. I have never had baklava that was fresh and this definitely was. It was delicious!!! Restaurants in this area have a bad habit of failing. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE go and try Mr. Geero!!"}
{"text":"I came here with my family because this place was close to our house and I felt like we needed to explore a little for restaurants around our neighborhood. With a 4 star review I decided it was worth a try for my tastebuds.  Looking at this area, in my opinion it's not exactly a good place for a restaurant. Located right next to the Bi-Lo and situated with conjoining restaurants it's iffy for a sit down restaurant.   I'll start with the good, and then move to on to the bad. The good thing, price. Meals here are good in price. Ranging from $2 or so appetizers to $5 subs and $8 combos. So, that points towards an awesome choice for lunches. Inside is clean and orderly not much to it though, just tables chairs and pictures on the wall. The counter you look into is a see through to the back of the kitchen which I feel is bigger than what they need. The food wasn't too bad, even though I felt as if everything did come out of a can and the lettuce wasn't amazingly fresh.   Now on to the bad. If you sit here to eat, I hope you have a phone or something on you because you will be bored. No entertainment and just tables is what awaits you. I felt as if I was at a Showmars, but less service and a smaller menu. Not to mention, when I did order off their menu it said that they offered cheese fries... But when I ordered it: \"We don't have any cheese fries...\" Well, that's interesting.  Overall, it wasn't amazing. Great place for lunch, but I don't know about dinner. No alcohol provided and well for a wings and sub shop especially one that makes cheese steaks I think this is not really that good... The food is okay, and prices are too. Lunch, yes. Dinner, No."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan as the food and decor is just so-so. It's priced accordingly, though, so it'd be good for a quick bite! The staff is very nice."}
{"text":"His food was bland and all frozen. No customers and the seating has rips in it. The owner was not very friendly. Praying I don't get sick"}
{"text":"Friendly staff! Wonderful food, especially fries! But didn't have any baklava. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"My first experience is quite exquisite! The Philly Cheese steak sandwich was awesome! I also bought a small Greek salad and it was awesome! Although the menu had many great choices, I decided to try one  item at a time based off the reviews. To anyone that is in the area of one of these restaurants, I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"There food is cheap and it shows why it's gross lady was rude and just wanted to get out of there would never order or go there again"}
{"text":"Pretty good. I went here with my husband and in laws after a visit to Latta Plantation. My husband had the gyro and I had the gyro sub with onion rings. The sub was great and greasy (not overly so) which hit the spot and I would get it again. The thing I hadn't expected were the onion rings, they were amazing!  The price was right to. If your hungry and in the area I suggest it."}
{"text":"Very good gyro .. fresh and tasty, I'll be back again... ambience is very basic almost cafeteria like but we enjoyed the overall experience. Fast and Fresh !"}
{"text":"More of a burger and wing joint than a Greek restaurant.  I was a bit disappointed with this place.  Hearing it was a Greek restaurant, I was expecting more than fries and burgers.  I wanted moussaka.  Would have settled for a good gyro, but that wasn't here either.  You see the other folks say the Philly Cheese steak is good.  Not greek at all.  What a joke.  This is an american restaurant, which is fine, but change the name to something a bit less misleading."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients in the best gyro I've ever eaten!  Super tasting french-fries with malt vinegar.  Plain atmosphere, friendly staff, very clean."}
{"text":"I can't get enough if that \"Philly Steak\" sub. And my wife loves the salads. The place is clean, staff is friendly, its quiet and relaxing. Perfect to go eat after work if you don't want to cook."}
{"text":"The food is subpar and the service as well..I'd rather go to Showmars.. Everything I've gotten has been bland and I've tried several items from their menu."}
{"text":"Great gyros! Quick and inexpensive for their combs. Generous portions and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Very delicious. Clean establishment. The Greek salad was awesome, the dressing is amazing. I also got the regular gyro, the sauce and meet is very good."}
{"text":"This place is a smaller - family owned style business. They are all so nice and accommodating. The decor isn't major but the food is great and incredibly affordable. We recently moved away and miss having this place just around the corner!"}
