{"text":"I loved this place! I liked the menu options A LOT more than what Layers offered. The customer service was awesome with really friendly staff. The food was great. I had a salmon sandwich and it was delightful. The side salad was great too- not too much dressing and the lettuce was definitely Fresh! The iced coffee was good too! I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"As the former unofficial mayor of layers, I was excited to see the tradition of \"fresh\"-ness was going to continue. Although the food MAY have been fresh, that's the best I can say about it. 


We ordered two breakfast scrambles with toast, etc. Everything was cold and the eggs had shells in them. On the plate you receive a dollop of cream cheese. No bagel accompanied the order, just cold toast and by toast, I mean warm bread. What is one to do with the cream cheese?

Coffee refills are free and thank heavens for that because when the first cup was poured, it was filled half way. 

Lastly, the water jug where you fetch your \"fresh\" water, hadn't been cleaned or changed in some time. The remains of old lemons clouded the bowl. 

All in all a poor review based on the product, not the service."}
{"text":"I ordered there spinach, feta cheese turnover and mocha latte...delicious! I went here once when it was Layers cafe. Same set up. Pretty clean and modern.  I would go here again. Mocha latte is not over sweetened."}
{"text":"Mom and I decided to stop here after a trip to the neighboring Staples.  We were pleasantly surprised by the unique culinary options, as well as the fresh-squeezed mint lemonade.

The dessert options were QUITE appealing to the sweet tooth.

A somewhat upscale hole-in-the-wall, we will be back!"}
{"text":"New bakery on the block, Fresh Bakery Cafe, looks pretty familiar. I was happy to see the smiling faces from the staff of Layers, the former tenants. The interior and furnishings still the same as well. 

-- New Observations--
New owner/owners (but I never saw them at this visit) 
Slightly different cafe menu offerings. Items look pretty simplistic and plain. 
Bakery goods - Cakes sold by slices, different pastry offerings 
They moved the utensils to on top of pick up counter 
There's a large round table in middle of dining area. 

I still don't have a clue what the focus of this place is. Or why it's called Fresh. Other than the \"fresh\"  squeezed juices, There's really no emphasis on it. Nor can I find any literature or anything on social media other than photos on their Facebook page. 

--Food--
Got Salmon sandwich. Just a simple sandwich with slices of salmon, cream cheese and wheat bread.  With lettuce, onions and tomato. Tasted good but nothing really exciting or daring like Chipotle aioli spread.  It was fresh though.

Looking over the menu, I see there's egg salad, ham, turkey, wraps,soups, smoothies, juices and coffee. 

The bakery cases were filled with cookies, pastries, cupcakes.  And different cakes and cakes sold by slices. 

I got a red velvet cake. It was okay. Moist, fresh and not overly sweet. Pretty sure it was more buttercream instead of cream cheese as the frosting and filling. Not my favorite. 

Prices were pretty affordable. Sandwich/Soup combo, lemonade with mint, cake, cookie totaled a little under twenty dollars. 

Good to see this place is open!"}
{"text":"The name is pretty accurate: the soups, salads, and sandwiches are made fresh, and there are two giant pastry cases full of cakes and treats. There's even a wall full of clean eating tips and info on superfoods toward the back. Their commitment to healthy options seems evident.

But their flavors leave a lot to be desired. Came in for breakfast but they have a limited and basic three-option menu, so I opted instead for lunch: half and half sandwich and salad combo. The EGG SALAD BLT was extremely disappointing: basic sliced wheat grocery store bread with pureed eggs, no seasoning whatsoever, and microwaved bacon. I took two bites and moved on to the GREEK QUINOA SALAD- because I love greek food, quinoa, and salad. The components were each okay, but they didn't harmonize and the dressing was oddly bitter. Did not finish either option.

Service was okay. Space is clean. I like the décor, especially the graphic print along the side booths and the lounge-like seating in the front. Order was ready quickly, and prices seem average- unfortunately, the food is too."}
{"text":"I was bummed to pull up and see Layers gone, but I headed in to give Fresh a try anyway. I ordered the same things that I ordered at Layers: Layers called it the Cafe Crossaint, Fresh calls it the Turkey BLT Crossaint Sandwich and a whoopie pie.  The sandwich was made with gross floppy bacon (like you find at subway), the lettuce was iceberg, the cheese was basic cheddar (it used to be a creamy white cheddar), the crossaint was not toasted and the addition of the tomato didn't make any difference, the turkey *seemed* the same. The mixed greens that came on the side were soft and wilty. Just didnt seem fresh. The whoopie pie was definitely not fresh either. I ordered the whoopie pie EVERY time I went to Layers -- It's my fave. This whoopie pie completely fell apart and was powdery. The \"frosting\" in the middle that is usually creamy and generous tasted like the frosting recipe on the back of a powdered sugar box. I will not be back to Fresh. Which is a bummer because I live in Henderson, nowhere near the other Layers location.

Just wanted to warn others-it may look a lot like Layers, but the quality and taste of food is not the same."}
{"text":"I ordered the quinoa wrap and it was absolutely delicious! I will be trying to replicate the recipie at home. I ordered the puff doggie for my daughter and it was very cute. It's a little on the pricy side, but what isn't on this side of town. I spend the same amount going to tropical smoothie. It's a lot healthier and has a beautiful bakery."}
{"text":"Curiosity and my mid afternoon coffee tooth drew me into the Fresh Bakery Cafe, formerly a Layers Cafe. 

The layout, colors and display are almost Identical to former cafe that used to be in this space. I think the new owners are banking on this consistency that current and new customers gravitate towards. Fresh Bakery Cafe no longer offers free iced coffee with a \"Yelp check-in\" like Layers used to, but they have stepped up the customer service and the desserts recipes. I did like Layers, but the last few times I came here it took a little long to get food orders in and a couple of the treats were dryer than I would prefer. 

I ordered an iced coffee, Reese's Peanut butter cup cookie, and an S'mores cupcake with marshmallow on the inside and scorch marshmallows on top. I'm not a sweets guy, but these two desserts were delicious. The Reese's cookie had peanut butter base with chunks of Reese's Peanut cups on top. This cookie is that perfect chewy chunky combination that many places fail at doing. 

The S'mores cupcake was very good and very moist. It also had a nice lite frosting on top and a gooey marshmallow filling. I intended to eat half and the give the rest to my fiancée, but this treat was too good to save. 

During my visit they were updated the logos on the outside if the building. My next time here will be solely on the savory side."}
{"text":"I decided to visit Fresh for lunch today to see how it had changed from it's previous incarnation, Layers.  It was rumored that when this bakery-cafe reopened under the Fresh moniker that they would have extended hours, an expanded, more diverse menu; and the addition of beer and wine.  However, it seems that most of these changes have not been implemented as of yet.  To be fair, they are open an additional two hours in the evening, until 6 PM; but the cafe menu is very basic, and no adult beverages have been added.

When I walked in, I was surprised to see that the decor, furniture, etc. remained unchanged and that even the personnel was the same.  I checked out the large overhead menu and noticed that for lunch they had two soups, four salad choices, and a few sandwiches, croissant sandwiches, and wraps.  What was nice is that they had 1/2 and 1/2 combos so I could try a couple items without commiting to a full order. 

Familiar face Brenda took my order, but she was unfamiliar with the new iPad register, so this took quite some time, but we got it worked out.  There was also only one gentleman preparing the orders, so getting our meal was also proved to be a lesson in patience, especially for this type of establishment. 

Food- I ordered a half a ham BLT croissant sans honey mustard with a half California salad.  The sandwich was delicious! The ham was real sliced ham, not deli lunch meat and the croissant was buttery decadence.  Unfortunately, the salad was a little bland.  There was a bunch of bacon on top, but it seemed like that thin precooked microwave bacon.  It had zero flavor.  The dressing also just seemed wet, no flavor or zing.  

My friend ordered the turkey BLT and said it was delicious, except for the honey mustard. She would do what I did and 86 that next time.

All in all, I will come back to test out their pastries, which looked good, one of their 4 smoothies, and maybe a couple other breakfast or lunch items."}
{"text":"This place tempts me every time I drive by to get to Target. On my most recent trip to Target I gave in to my temptation and stopped in. 

The last time I was here it was Layers Bakery. I was a little surprised that the inside decor and even the food offerings seemed to be the same as the former bakery. It seemed like the same place with a new name. 

I had the Artichoke and Ham quiche plus two goodies to go. The quiche was flavorful and reasonably priced since it came with two sides. The eggs weren't as set as most quiches though. My Blondie Bar was good, but not great. For my husband I grabbed a Harvest Bar. He said he enjoyed the flavor, but it was not as moist as I would have expected. 

We'll stop in here and there since it's so convenient. This place will do the job if you are looking for a sweet treat. They do carry a large variety of sweets from bars to cupcakes to breakfast entrees."}
{"text":"Had an early dinner here with my kids. They had a puffy doggie which was good, a grilled PB and J which my son finished with no problem, and a cup of chicken noodle soup which was amazing. I had a quiche that was good with nicely sliced fresh fruit and small salad. The iced coffee was great and the cupcakes yummy. 

Friendly service and very clean. 

Reason why not a 5: kids meal sides could be more creative for the price, improved display cases would probably increase customers since you can see them from the front of the store (almost didn't go in) and the cupcakes were good but not the best I ever had."}
{"text":"This used to be Layers and is now called Fresh.  Fresh does not mean Organic which Layers did have some items which were.  I guess Fresh is because everything is made fresh to order.  The staff is ok, they were not overly friendly like when it was the other place but they were fine.

The food was not anything special, the menu has changed from the previous place and the selections are not as great as they used to be.  We had sandwiches and salad and it was not anything really special, it was your average.  

This is a place I would go back to if I was in the area and needed to eat something but to make a special trip to come eat here is something I would not do based solely on the fact that there is nothing in the place to specify they serve anything organic.  We prefer fresh organic items and there are way too many places now that serve the same items they have but with organic produce and better seasoning to really make the food stand out.

Here they just seem to serve you but not really go out of their way to make the food items stand out and leave a WOW impression.  From what this place used to be and how we used to feel when leaving this place to what it is now, its just ok.  I am glad there is something there as a choice for people, but with places not to far down the road that serves organic items, I would go to those places first."}
{"text":"I purchased 6 cupcakes: 2 yellow & 4 red velvet.  The red velvet cupcakes were anything but fresh.  The cupcakes were hard and stale and the cream cheese frosting was gummy.  The yellow cupcakes tasted just okay.  I also purchased a chocolate croissant that was prepared perfectly."}
{"text":"Seeking pastries for breakfast, my wife and I checked the display cases and were disappointed to find not much of a selection though there was a greater variety of baked desserts.  We ended up with a blueberry scone and blueberry muffin, the former more moist than the later - who would have figured?  We plan on giving them another chance the next time we are in the mood for a dessert or two."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with my boss for lunch and I've gotta say, it's quite good. I always get the Chicken Gyro Plate, which has always been more than satisfying and is plenty to eat. I decided to try a chocolate chip cookie from here recently and was pleasantly surprised at how fresh, soft, and delicious it was. The food is fresh and tastes good, that's all I can really say about it. I'd definitely recommend it as a lunch spot."}
