{"text":"Just had the Curry Chicken Dinner and it was incredible!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place way back a few years ago but kind of forgot about it. I had been on a kick to try oxtail and was searching all around my area and just happened to fall upon this tiny restaurant again as I was in the area. I was very happy with my findings, the oxtail is super tender and just falls apart. You get very little bones in the actual dish, and the dish itself is huge. The gravy that it's stewed in is mouth watering and the rice and peas and potatoes and great as well. I don't eat the roti but I was told that there are better so I'm not sure. My only con is that when I ask for gravy on the side it is very oily compared to other restaurants, it tastes great but very oily."}
{"text":"Probably the worst West Indian food I've had. The kidney beans were dry. The veggie meal didn't have much variety as they advertised. It's very strong in curry taste. It's more Indian food then West Indian. The doubles were inedible. Will not be returning and it's no wonder why they have such a low rating. But then again West Indian food is hard to come by in Oakville."}
{"text":"Good but not great. I had the goat roti and also tasted the chicken roti. Both were ok but I don't think this place is worth me driving there just for roti. Cori's is better."}
{"text":"Great tasting food, good value. Don't expect a smile from the front desk. Food is served fresh and quickly. Authentic Roti with no filler like some competitors."}
{"text":"Really good Rotis. Have had both chicken and goat. The dhalpourie is fresh and not too chewy, the curry had an abundance of meat not just potato. Large size roti for $8 was a bargain. There are several other Roti shops in Oakville and Burlington, but this one is my favourite."}
{"text":"Had both goat and chicken roti to go, took a few min. To make.  Goat was a bit dry but chicken was great, potion was good but wish there was a bit more meat then potato.

They suppose to take debit but the girl said their machine is not working but they got an ATM in store for me to use.  When I tried to use it it said communication error.  Then she offered me to try using debit and it worked?!?  I find it so weird!!!"}
{"text":"After grocery shopping at Organic Garage, I decided to duck into this place to grab a bite. The review below is correct with being able to smell the spices from OG; this could be a good or bad thing,  depending if you like strongly scented food. Small resto with a couple dine in tables. I waited 5-10 minutes for my hot goat roti and it was quite tasty and well filled. I wouldn't say it was hot though, more medium."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out since my coworker told me that they had gluten free options. I ordered the chicken curry over rice and peas. It came over rice and kidney beans (maybe the sign was wrong?). Anyways, the portion was massive - rice, potato, chicken. The rice lasted me three meals total since I brought the leftovers home. 
The woman working the front desk was distracted and cut me off several times mid sentence to talk to someone behind me, which I felt was quite rude - but the food was good so whatevs. 
In terms of gluten free, all of the meats were available as gluten free curries over rice. No upcharge but probably more expensive than regular lunches since the gluten free meals are classed as \"dinners\". I paid $11 and it was a ton of food - pretty decent for oakville."}
{"text":"A great West Indian restaurant. Had the boneless chicken roti and it was phenomenal. Like most roti joints, it's packed well, offers a filling experience, and is packed with a lot of flavour. There is a lot of potato in this roti, which can be a good or bad thing depending on what you like. Some of my friends who enjoyed a roti with me didn't enjoy the potato rich experience. I got the mild spice, which held up to be very consistent with a mild flavour. I would definitely come back and try the goat roti. 4.5/5"}
