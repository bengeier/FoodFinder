{"text":"Very simple looking place with two nice ladies working away making sandwiches. I tried the breaded chicken supreme and thoroughly enjoyed it. Great for take out as the space is not as appetizing as the food."}
{"text":"Went today at lunch and had the veal sandwich with tomato sauce which costs about $7+tax. Excellent size and portion. I could hardly finish the sandwich, Bun was soft and veal was nice and tender."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon as she was closing. Me and my buddy wanted some panini. She let us in, locked the doors and even though she was busy with a delivery order, made me and friend two fresh panini. Talk about customer service.   The bread was fresh. The veal was tender and thinly cut. Sauce tasted homemade. I will definitely come back here in the future.  5/5 for me!"}
