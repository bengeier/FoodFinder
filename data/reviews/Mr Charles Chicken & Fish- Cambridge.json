{"text":"My family and I tried to eat here tonight but we just ended up walking out of the restaurant.   We arrived at 6:50 PM and were immediately seated, but that is where our customer service ended for the evening. The restaurant was about half full, and seemed relatively calm for a Saturday night, so we were excited at the prospect of having a quick bite to eat and going on our way. After being seated we waited for 15 minutes without anyone paying us any attention. A busser eventually came to our table and took our drink order, and even said he would let a waiter know we were ready, but after we recieved our drinks we were never spoken to by another employee until we walked out the door.   While we sat and waited I personally watched a waitress (who was working while wearing a tan pocketbook) windex the front door, have multiple conversations with other empoyees and customers there, and even take a personal call on her cellphone in the middle of the restaurant. We also saw multiple people behind the bar holding various conversations with other employees. After seeing all of this I realized that we were fighting a losing battle trying to get food, so we walked out at 7:20.  Another customer alerted the owner, who came out to our car and offered to pay for our meals. Unfortunately with a 5 month old we really couldn't stick around for much longer without risking a meltdown so we were not able to take him up on his offer. I appreciate him trying to make it right, but it's going to be hard for me to forget this bad experience.  Hopefully they can get their situation figured out because with service like this I don't forsee a lot of repeat business."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. I had the fried chicken dinner with two sides. The chicken was cooked perfectly. I also got the broccoli casserole which was good but not the best that I've had, and the wedges which were really good. For desert I got the pound cake which was a little too sugary for my taste. With all stated I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I have probably been anticipating this place opening for so long that the food didn't quite live up to the hype for me.  I gave this place a second try and the chicken was still rather pinter for what I was expecting. They fry up the chicken very nicely though - if you care about the crunch more than anything else, this is the place for you!  But there was very little meat on the wings that came with the chicken and waffles, and the waffles were nothing special either. Coming from California, I was probably expecting too much out of their chicken and waffles and skinny wings were not what I was expecting to be served.  I will be coming back often though because my wife loves the food here. The staff has always been wonderful, and they have a bar! And the everything is reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"The only downside about this place is that the hardly ever answer their phone. Today I was actually able to get through and put my order in. As soon as I arrived to the restaurant my food was coming out the kitchen. The food was delicious. It was too good to take a picture. Lol. You can sit inside if you want to and they have an open bar."}
{"text":"We decided to try this restaurant on a Friday night. The take out line was extremely long so we sat down. The food was hot and good. However, we waited about 35 minutes to receive it. The waitress was not as attentive as she could have been with such a small amount of people dining in. It wasn't the worst but it certainly wasn't the best!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out yesterday from this location. I had the combo plate of fried chicken and shrimp with mac and cheese and broccoli casserole. Have to admit the chicken and shrimp were rather tasty. It wasnt too greasy and it has a food crunch and taste. The mac and cheese, well it wasn't mama's! It was just mediocre, dont think I will try again. The brocolli casserole was decent, could have used a little more broccoli and in a person who loves cheese.  Overall it was good and will try this place again!"}
{"text":"This place has been around for a while and is a Charlotte staple. I was very excited to see when they opened a second location with in dinning seating. Same delicious food but now in a different atmosphere. The new location even has a bar and the hostess was defiantly excited to serve us and couldn't wait for us to come back.  I highly suggest if ordering fish to get it salt and pepper and fried hard! They also have great lunch specials which I got which was friend fish that came with with potato wedges. Make sure you try out the collard greens and their friend chicken!"}
{"text":"Food and service were excellent. Both fish and chicken were crispy and fresh, cooked perfectly. Will return soon!"}
{"text":"My family and I moved a couple of blocks from Mr. Charles not too long ago. We finally go5 a chance to go the other night. There wasn't anything on our table that wasn't scrumptious. The food was awesome and the fried chicken was the best I've had in the area. The staff wad friendly also and the prices were very reasonable. We will be making this our go to."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for the food here after hearing so many raving reviews. However the food was lacking serious flavor. It tatsted like they forgot to use any kind of seasoning and just threw flour on the food to fry it. I only gave two stars because the cashier was friendly. Definitely won't be going back or spending my hard earned money on this flavorless food."}
{"text":"Food is very good but service is terrible.  Even if you call ahead for take out you'll be waiting for 20 minutes.  It's like they have either an inexperienced crew or they just don't know how to juggle their work.  Frustrating."}
{"text":"Mr. Charles was really good! The fried okra was my favorite. The staff was very nice and our food came out hot and quickly. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"An unassuming sit down restaurant hiding, arguably, the best fried chicken in Charlotte! The sides were crisply fried, not overly greasy and pure heaven!! Go now!!"}
{"text":"I have been there 3 times. First two were good the third time I was waiting quite a while for my take away order. Guy before me got his went out the door then came back in saying he got someone else's order, that it was a hamburger and he ordered chicken . They gave him his then instantly mine was ready. I had ordered a hamburger. I asked if it was the same one and they said no. When I got home it looked like it had been messed with so I tossed it and decided not to go back. I was sitting right there and could hear the 2 others order. They both ordered chicken. What would you think?"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Mr. Charles Chicken & Fish and I must say I was very impressed. I arrived before the evening rush so I was seated immediately. The staff were friendly and personable. With being a first time customer I needed to look over the menu a bit before I finally decided on an order.  Everything sounded appetizing on the menu but I decided on the All American; this is comprised of two pieces of chicken, a piece of fried whiting, baby shrimp, and two sides. I chose macaroni and cheese and broccoli casserole.   I didn't have to wait very long before my food was brought out to me piping hot. Everything was cooked and seasoned to perfection. The chicken was flavorful and tender; definitely not overcooked or greasy. The whiting was crispy and delicious. The macaroni and broccoli casserole tasted like my grandmother cooked it! Needless to say after the first few bites I was hooked.  This was a very pleasant visit and I will most certainly return. If my future visits are as great as this one, this will be a favorite."}
{"text":"So, ummm, yeah, I had decided that my sole soul-food outlet was set in stone with my last visit to ERD. But as luck would have it, I ran into a couple of these Mr. Charles' daddi-o's at Sam's Club and got to chatting and I decided with such awesome and genial folks at the helm (Michael and Corwyn, you know I'm talking about you!), I better go try their food. Off I went yesterday  with my kids to Mr. Charles' new sit down joint. RIGHT AWAY when I opened the door, Michael hollered at me by name!!! That kind of thing just sets the mood. Felt welcome and happy to be there. The warmth of the folks working there and the introduction to all the employee's was super nice.  But what's really important was the food, right?!? Well, they do NOT disappoint! Fried green beans were delightful, the hush puppies with just a hint of vanilla were amazing, the shrimp and fish cooked perfectly and more importantly, with excellent flavor. \"Hey, Vic, what about the chicken???\" The chicken was brilliant!! I could just wrap myself in the fried chicken and my cares would wash away until it was all in my tummy.   As earlier stated, I thought I had found my one and only soul food joint and was pretty much sticking to it. But Mr Charles' has proved that you can love two places equally with the same fervor. I will be back and I will go to the other joint and I will love them both for they are locally owned, small businesses who treat their food with the same love and care that they treat their guests, and that gets my business every time!  Another 5 star soul food joint?!?!? YOU KNOW!!!!!!  Eat well, YELPERS, and remember to support your locals!"}
{"text":"So decided to try this place since its close to my house. I ordered the chicken and shrimp dinner and asked for jumbo shrimp instead of the baby shrimp with a large order of okra, mac n cheese and collard greens.I waited for 40 min for my order after being asked several times what did I order....When I got my order I had two small pieces of chicken and 4 \"jumbo\" shrimp now all of this was about $21.00...It was not worth the money or wait...the collards were not seasonsed well and the mac n cheese was alright....for 21.00 my taste buds should have been jumping instead they were extremely disappointed."}
