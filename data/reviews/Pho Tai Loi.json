{"text":"I reallyyyy wanted to love this place, but I don't. It's just 'meh'. 

It's on the cheaper end, sure, but it's not that cheap considering how much/what you're getting. The convenience of getting pho at a food court is great, but it's does not come at the same standards. 

Their pho broth was SUPER SALTY. Yes, I'm pretty salty about it. The amount of MSG made it very difficult to eat. I've never felt so crappy after eat a bowl of pho. And as a Vietnamese staple dish, that pho was very disappointing. 

The rice was worse; I had their 'Com tam ga nuong bi cha op la' (Rice, grilled chicken, shredded pork, steamed egg, fried egg). The chicken was mediocre, steamed egg was dried and stale, the fried egg was over cooked and rubbery?!? 

They raised the price some dishes, and did not update their menus, and still managed to overcharge us on top of that..

I realize my review seems like an anomaly amongst the rest, but.. it was bad. 
Even by fast-food/food court standards, it's still not great. 

TL;DR - Food is cheap, but mediocre even by food-court standards. And be prepared to drink a litre of water after. If you're sensitive to MSG, avoid."}
{"text":"What a cool food court find!! The moment you walk into this little mall it's like being transported in time to an old school Asian mall ( think Richmond Public Market minus the produce/wet market). You can get your cell phone repaired, cargo mailed, purchase bootleg VCDs, sort out immigration woes,get nails done, and then buy a new shirt and have lunch. How crazy is that?! 

Anyway, this little find was not bad for a food court stall, nothing fancy here but the Bun Bo hue was good as far as food court food goes. In it, there was an assortment of pork blood, Vietnamese ham, pigs knuckle (?!?), tendon brisket on round rice noodles in a mildly spicy broth. I am not too sure about the authenticity of this dish but it tasted pretty good and had a fair amount of ingredients.

My companions had an assortment of pho and banh mi, all of them looked happy with their meals and it all disappeared quickly to the place of no return!

It seemed to me that the pho could have used a bit more ingredients, as I did not observe the typical layers of beef on top of the noodles. Also, the banh mi seemed a bit understuffed to me..perhaps I'm just spoiled by my fave Banh Mi Saigon in Vancouver ;)"}
{"text":"Bang for the buck this is a good place and their food is good too.  Price wise a beef pho was about 5 bucks, a generous plate of chicken pad thai (lots of chicken) with sprouts on the side was about 8 bucks.  The pork banh mi sandwiches are about a foot long baguettes, warmed up, fresh cool veggies and a decent amount of meat and it's barely 3 bucks!

This place is beside Arigato near the south west side of the building in the food court which has about 7 or so places to eat.

There are vermicelli, rice and other dishes available as well.  The choices are decent and the quality for the price is pretty good.  I haven't been to this place in years but I was happy to remember that it's so nearby to where I live.

2.80 for a pork banh mi sandwich?  Great deal, good sandwich!  Cash only..."}
{"text":"My go to place when I want some Bun bo Hue or Bo Kho! Home style cooking is simply amazing!"}
{"text":"Not many people will know this but this place has the best Beef stir fry in all of Mississauga.  The beef is very tender and moist.  It is located in a food court of an office building so most people will not know it is there."}
{"text":"Unique experience, a fairly odd mall, full of bootleg dvd sellers, cellphone case sellers, etc..
Amidst it all is a pretty happening food court, about 10 Chinese restaurants and this Pho/Vietnamese spot.  Due to all the competition the prices are very fair at Pho Tai Loi.  You pay (cash), get a number and sit, wait for it to be called out.  The surrounding shops are terrible, the food options good!  The rare beef and chicken pho; $5.75.  As good a deal as you will find in Ontario.  The chicken pad thai ($7.99) also very good and cheaper than most places."}
{"text":"The food here is fresh, delicious and plentiful. The cashier is warm and always has a smile on her face. The dishes I would recommend are the banh mi (viet sandwiches) which are made fresh to order and on a soft bun. The vermicelli dishes have well seasoned meats and come with a salad with a fish sauce dressing. The pho and beef stew are delicious as well. They taste home made and have great flavour! This stall provides restaurant quality food. If you are looking for great Vietnamese good in Mississauga, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Came here for a casual dinner. I had the rare beef pho and a side of spring rolls here. The price is pretty cheap and the portion is decent (slightly on the large side).  The pho is average, I found that it wasn't as chewy as I'd like it.  The broth was flavourful.  The spring rolls were very crispy and fresh and were only $2.50! Overall the food tasted decent, however, I got a stomach ache after and I'm not sure if it was caused by raw the bean sprouts, or something in the pho."}
{"text":"This eatery is in a mall by my workplace. Before visiting it, I had tried one of the other Chinese food establishments over a year ago. 

A couple of Saturdays, I literally walked a couple of times through the food court area. There are roughly four Chinese eateries, but there wasn't any dish that stood out.

I then found Pho Tai Loi. I went with the grilled chicken vermicelli with a crispy spring roll. The woman working the counter was friendly and advised that my number would be called.

I sat in the food court waiting. Sure enough, my order was ready. I thanked her, picked up my tray of food, and started to eat at the table. The vermicelli was delicious. Why didn't I know about this place?! So good!

I will come back to try one of the pho dishes. It's a great place to get authentic Vietnamese food that is yummy and cheap.

{"text":"Great soup, cold dishes and wings...It's not often that I give out 5 stars for a 'food court style restaurant' but I am making an exception here. Everything here is prepared fresh daily, and the food here is very consistent in terms of freshness and taste. Service is fast and friendly, the portions are generous and they never skimp on dishes that have meat in them. I used to work around the corner and this way my Friday lunch go to place. I now live in Toronto, but occasionally come to Sauga on weekends, and when I do, I always have a great lunch here :)"}
