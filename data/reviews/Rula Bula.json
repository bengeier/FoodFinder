{"text":"The service is meh. The food is traditional Irish fair so to the unfamiliar it's bland. It's cabbage and taters. But the key is that they do it right. They are also one of the few places in, not just Arizona, but all of America that get's their Guinness directly from Guinness made the traditional way. They do have the BEST Black & Tans. It's a bar with bar food, but at lunch time I'm reminded of hardy bangers and hash and fish and chips and corn-beef hash and shepherds pie that I'm so used to. All their food is home style like your mom made it.  If the service was a little, and I mean just a little bit, better they'd get my fifth star. If you're coming down to the Phoenix from Flagstaff this place will seem very familiar with the hipster-dive type atmosphere that are most places in Flagstaff."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with a co-worker and ordered the fish/shrimp combo with chips. The food and service was excellent! Will go back there again for sure!"}
{"text":"I had a mac and cheese burger from here and the wonderful memory will remain in my heart forever. Next time I'm adding bacon!  Love the style of the place, the deck in back is awesome. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The only reason I am not giving 5 stars, is cause it is a wee bit pricey. But oh, so worth it! One of the best Guinness pours in town. Great atmosphere, misters on their back patio. I always get the Shepard's pie - out of this world. My wife loves the veggie version of the Shepard's pie and the salad with salmon. You gotta try a side of the brussel sprouts with apples. Yum. Like any place on Mill Ave, it get crowded TH-SA during the school year. And can get noisy."}
{"text":"If you are Irish (which I am) and in Tempe, Az., this is home for you!!!  I loved the place.  Lots of Irish momentos, had some of the finest Guinness's mixed with other items.  For intance, had a Guiness with Cider (corwn float).  It made it tasty.   Did not have food, (ate nearby).  But saw the menu had reasonable prices and the food was irishy.  The Bartender, Steve, was friendly and informative.  Everyone should stop in when on Mill St. in Tempe and have a Guinnes.  Slainte!!!!"}
{"text":"Visited with a group of friends for drinks on the patio. Has a good atmosphere outside, so we were pumped. When we sat down, it took what seemed like forever for our waitress to finally greet us and take our drink order. However, once we got rolling she was fairly attentive. My problem with this place is the bartenders. My friend ordered two different martinis that were so horribly made that she sent both of them back. I ordered 3 vodka sodas in an hour ($6 a pop on well) and left there stone cold sober. They were almost certainly 100% soda water with a lime.  I tipped my waitress well, but left her a note advising her not to tip her bartenders."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars. I had a hard time picking between 3 and 4.  The food tastes amazing, portions are huge, and the people are very nice. But, they've gotten my order wrong 2 out of the 3 times I've eaten there, and it was different people getting it wrong. Maybe it's just too noisy in there? But they never ask me to repeat it or give any other indications that they can't hear me."}
{"text":"I have yet to find a better fish and chips this side of the Atlantic ocean. Pair it with a Guinness, and you'll be in heaven. Corned beef ain't bad either, although it's not particularly lean (yes, I know, it's an Irish restaurant!).  Good for lunch meals (since it's usually not packed at lunch), as long as you plan on not being able to think very clearly for the rest of the day. ; )  Update #1: I asked an Irish friend of mine for his \"take\" on Rula Bula's. I didn't want to lead the Yelp community astray... He says it's the best Irish food in town! So, I guess you can take that to the bank.  Update #2: A friend and I were dining at Rula Bula's when a patron behind us starting choking. I gave the heimlich a whirl, but not having the best upper body strength, stepped aside when the professional help arrived (first a very nice cook and then perhaps a manager?). Anyway, heimlich was successful, and everyone went home safe and sound (after eating the rest of the meal, of course). Hey, that's cool. I like eating at a place that's not afraid to save a life or two... Oh, the meal was good too ~ lamb stew for my friend and corned beef for me. ; )"}
{"text":"This place is expensive and the food sucks.The corned beef was cold and looked like it had been sitting out all day. It is like an Irish TGI Fridays."}
{"text":"We were double billed and the service was horrible. We sat on the patio and were completely ignored for 15 minutes until my husband got up and got our beers at the bar. The table next to us seemed to have no trouble getting them tobring their drinks however. Perhaps they were friends with the staff?  I've been here for dinner before as well and while the food is decent I'm not overly impressed. Having been to my fair share of Irish pubs in Ireland this is not a good representation. It is definately an American idea of an Irish pub and it is appropriately overpriced for the \"tourists\". I'll go to the pub down the street for better service and a true Irish feel from now on."}
{"text":"We were here in a party of fifteen so I always anticipate issues with service and food quality with that many people. And it was a busy night. Not so here. All of our meals were great as was the service and level of attention. The bier wasn't bad either"}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible place......rude management, lazy bartenders, stupid servers. The place literally stinks.......as for being an authentic Irish pub....me thinks not.....its about as Irish as a mexican taco stand and trust me i lived in Ireland for a long long time.....its as though they bought the interior from Irish pubs r us mail order catalog. Clientele are preppy student types with not a lot of gumption who easily buy into the faux \"plastic paddy\" facade.......if you want a real Irish experience i would suggest O'Connors on Dunlap or Tim Finnegans or Seamus Mc Caffreys in Downtown Phoenix......avoid this place at all costs.....pure and utter crap...."}
{"text":"I go here for happy hour and enjoy hanging out on the back patio, which has a feeling of a quaint urban setting. The wait staff is excellent and friendly and they make an awesome snakebite! I have not eaten here so I can't say anything about the food, but the atmosphere is lively and I always have a great time at Rula Bula."}
{"text":"Irish Sangria is AMAZING! The food was good, and the atmosphere was pleasant. Friendly, helpful, staff. Seriously, get the Sangria."}
{"text":"Oh Rula Bula, I hate that this is how my last visit turned out. As evidenced by my former review, you used to be my favorite bar on Mill until last Friday, June 15th. I decided to have my birthday party and moving away party at Rula Bula. You guys were charging cover and would not let me in for free even though it was the day of my birthday. Seriously? You guys must be the only place on Mill with that policy! So I paid because this is where I told all of my friends I'd be and I went inside. Well apparently you don't do well in the customer service training area because the red headed girl taking the money outside was sweet enough to call me a b*tch while my boyfriend was still right there. While workers will gripe about customers, it would most certainly bode well for you to tell your employees to at least wait until the whole party said person arrived with has gone inside because saying that in front of people doesn't really help build good customer relations.  The only upside is that Emily was good server, she was attentive, though our car bombs were skimpy. Over all I am saddened that I will have to find a new place to hold my coming back party when I come to see all of my friends."}
{"text":"Ok Irish nachos and beer. I will say the service for a table of 20 was amazing. I just never felt like it was a great experience. I have been back a few times after my first visit. This place has gotten much much better in the past couple of months! This is now one of my favorite places in Tempe."}
{"text":"In Tempe for a convention.  The wings are among the best I have ever had, and far superior to any nearby restaurant.   The wings, fish and chips, and corned beef were all excellent.  Well priced, great service.  We wish we had eaten here every night instead of the final night of our convention.  If we lived in Tempe we would make this a regular haunt."}
{"text":"Today is March 17th St Patrick's Day we came here to have lunch my wife has been waiting to take me here. Upon arrival we were informed that there is a $5 cover charge per person just to enter the building and eat lunch regardless if you're not drinking neither one of us drink. We are extremely disappointed. How greedy can an owner be does he need that much money to make $10 extra on every person or a couple that walks in. True example of greed. How much money does a person need to make. Are they needing money so bad that they have to figure out a way to make extra money without having quality food. Just a question totally disappointed in the owners greed. If I could rate it -10 I would."}
{"text":"Being of Irish decent, and having toured Ireland in the 80's, this doesn't make my list of good Irish pubs. The atmosphere is nice, I'll give them that.  Although they tout that the bar itself was made in Ireland and imported to that location, it looks nothing like the bars I saw in Ireland. Go there for the alcochol is my recommendation.  Guiness is Guiness no matter where you get it.  I thought the food was lousy. I had the Shepherd's Pie, and I sent it back. The pub does occupy a good location on Mill Avenue, so if you don't like it, you don't have to walk far to find someplace else."}
{"text":"Wicked tasty shepherds pie, friendly staff and nice environment. Thanks for the great recommendation Yelpers (I was visiting on business)."}
{"text":"Fantastic menu that can be consumed any time of the day! Personal favorites include their mac&cheese, pork chops, and mussels! They always have a ton of Stella readily available and on tap, as well as Bass and Newcastle and duh..Guinness.  Their fish&chips are delisch as well (although I am always a bit skeptical of eating seafood in the desert)...!   i like!"}
{"text":"Awesome Irish pub! Friendly service and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I'm between 3 and 4 stars on this one. I went here for Trivia recently and sat at the bar. I had the shephards pie, which was delicious. There are a lot of good beers on draft, and the batender knew how to properly pour a Guinness.   They have trivia nights on Wednesdays. It's not a bad way to spend a weeknight.  Also, a word of caution - I only noticed 2 small TV's in the bar area. Not necessarily a bad thing, but if you're going out to watch a game it might be better to check elsewhere.  Overall, a good bar to get a properly poured Guinness, above average bar food, and a really unique atmosphere."}
{"text":"Terrible!! beware!! This place up-charges ( adds approx 30% ) to your bill if you pay with a debit card! I went last week for lunch with my co-worker and I had the burger. It was bland but overall a good burger. I paid for lunch for the two of us and my co-worker paid the tip in cash direct to the waitress. I gave my card to the waitress, and before she returned to our table, my chase bank alert was sent to my phone--typical email alert I have set up, but when I looked at the amount Rula Bula ( Boeher Hospitality LLC ) had added 30% to my bill and charged it to my debit card. I asked the waitress and she said had the typical ...duh...deer in the headlights look--she went to the \"manager' ( bald guy about 45-50 who was behind the bar. She came back and said they add 30% because of the tip. I reminded her we had already paid her cash for the tip and I never put a tip on my receipt. She again said she wasn't sure why ( deer in the headlights) and asked me to see the manager if i had a problem with it! Are you serious? Of course, I have a problem with it. I went and spoke to the old bald guy behind the bar and he said they add 30%  to all college kids because they run their debit cards to zero and can't pay their tips. Are you serious?.., I asked! I reminded him I'm 40 years old and not a college kid. He then stated every bar/restaurant on Mill automatically does this to all patrons since most are college kids on Mill and it is a buffer charge from the bank! He then stated my charge is only pending and would be changed later to the correct amount. Are you serious? This is crap, as I work on Rio & Mill and eat lunch on the strip everyday at every place on the strip. Rula Bula ( Boeher Hospitality LLC) is the only place that has done this. My co-worker said he had been going there for years and never checked his debit card statement--but he will now!  Are you checking your debit card statements? Set up an alert to your email and go there and see what I'm talking about!! What a shame to have a nice place with good food ruined by pathetic unprofessional management. The place is a scam. If this happens to you and someone wants to file a class action law suit, please get a hold of me. The management are ignorant and willingly doing this. No one should give these people our hard earned money to hold onto till they decide what to charge us."}
{"text":"Best Guinness around, great staff, fantastic happy hour food.."}
{"text":"There food is great. I love there Bread Pudding and there Shepard's Pie. Both are delicious! If you are looking for a nice place with the occasional local guitarist, its a good place."}
{"text":"Good food, good drinks, good music. We went during afternoon. The potatoes skins and spicy potatoe balls are recommended!"}
{"text":"Aside from an Irish Pub in Illinois, this has one of the best Sheppards Pie that I've ever had. They have fantastic service, good craque (atmosphere) and good music."}
{"text":"A really nice bar and restaurant with some classic Irish dishes. The service was excellent and the food very good. And the draft beer selection was good as well - what you would expect at an Irish bar. The Guinness was not quite as creamy as I had in Dublin but I suspect the brew does not travel as well as one would like."}
{"text":"Not after today.  Your food is good. I never mind paying for good food. I never mind paying for good service either. But if your going to be a pricey Irish Pub you better be great at both. My father ran authentic Irish Pubs in Milwaukee WI. I know quite a bit about the bar and restaurant business. The owner should be available or if he is not, he should never wonder why some things don't bring in money. It's the inconsistent service, surly managers, a hostess that seemed to hate seating people etc. You don't play Irish music. I am told that is because you are in a spot close to a university . Funny, Trininty Hall Irish Pub in Dallas is just a stone's throw from SMU, yet still have a wide menu, Irish music, Sports, poker night, trivia and a staff that goes out of there way to know your name when you come in every week. We moved in mid-November and have come about once a week, yet, not a single soul in your \" Craic\" pub, knows us. I blame an absentee owner."}
{"text":"My wife and I have started frequenting Mill Ave for restaurants that offer something different.  Rula Bula fits that bill.  We are always down for something new - so I tried the Shepard's Pie.  It was really tasty - even if it was made with beef instead of lamb.  It really reminded me of food that my mother made when I was growing up - except that it was more polished.  I really did like it.  My wife really enjoyed her entree as well.  I don't recall what it's called, but it was basically stewed beef served in potato (pan)cakes.  She shared with me and I really enjoyed it as well.  Both entrees came with broccoli, which I welcome over fries, every day.  It was at the high end of what I would pay for good, fresh-made, basic home cooking.    Finally, I had no idea that the place had a large patio out back.  I have always seen it from Mill - where it looks small.  But once inside, you see that Rula has two personalities - one is a family restaurant and the other is a college bar.  I think they co-exist well here."}
{"text":"YOU NEED TO EAT HERE! Everything was perfectly cooked. The sauces they have for their appetizer fries was amazing. 4 of us went and argued whose was better. Go now!"}
{"text":"This isn't a 'just went to this place once' review - it's a 'been going to this place for years' review. Just thought I'd clarify that before getting into it. Rula Bula rocks. It was actually my first culinary experience when I moved to the valley 7 years ago. I was skeptical, as Irish pubs don't typically have a great deal to offer vegetarians (which I was at the time... now I eat fish, which opens up the menu a bit), but Rula Bula's got a few really tasty veggie options, including veggie potato skins, vegetarian shepherd's pie (that's right - never seen that anywhere else, and oh so delicious), and the four-cheese grilled sandwich. I prefer to go for lunch or dinner, as the place gets a little college kid crowded rowdy the later it gets. Yeah, I know - I'm old."}
{"text":"-Irish pub atmosphere (that's what you were expecting, right?). -Patio for when you need some fresh air. -Occasional live folk music. -Decadent bread pudding: totally worth it no matter what you're drinking."}
{"text":"While I love the fact that there's an Irish pub on Mill Avenue, I have to agree with Stevey P. when he says that it's missing something. I've been to Irish pubs all over the Valley and Rula doesn't exude that same warmth that Chandler's Fibber Magees does or  the free-spirited feel of Phoenix's Seamus McCafferys or the Cheers-vibe of Casey Moore's.  And the bar's food has never really wowed me. But if you want something different then the usual \"Girls Gone Wild\" bars that line Mill Avenue, this is your place. You won't see guys doing body shots off the girls. And you can get a mean Black Velvet."}
{"text":"Don't go there!!!   Worst service EVER!!!!!!! My companion and I were seated and no one came over, even to take our drink order for OVER 15 minutes.   When I complained, they were rude and uncaring!  Stay far, far away!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped by this place while wondering around mill St.   And it's delicious. .. very rarely do you go to a restaurant where every dish that comes out is delicious. ...I highly recommend this place.  Great food.  Great atmosphere and of course great beer. .."}
{"text":"Good place to eat or get a beer for happy hour. They have many classic Irish dishes, burgers, and sandwiches. Sweet potato fries are quite tasty. Nice location right on Mill Avenue with patio."}
{"text":"Rula Bula is a great spot. It has survived the test of time on Mill Avenue (miss Long Wongs).  I dont go to Rula's that often but when i do go, its always been a good experience. only once have i gone there and just found it way too crowded for me to enjoy my time there but it can get pretty busy in there, especially Fri-Sat.  The staff is very friendly. On one occasion i went there with a friend and she asked me whats good here, i simply stated\"ask the bartender\" and the bartender proceeded to ask her what types of beers she drinks and then gave her some recommendations based on her taste. Most bars point you the the wall of beers and say \"any of those are good\" Also on that same night she had left her coat on a bar-stool outside and the bartender immediately saw that and placed it behind the bar. when she started to panic because she realized she lost her coat, the manager came up to us and said they have her coat and went outside grabbed her coat and brought it back to her.   Try the Magners Cider \"good stuff Maynard\""}
{"text":"This is like the worst chain restraint, a nice barmaid but everything you hate to see on a night out otherwise. an embarrassment to the Irish bar name. go to olive garden instead"}
{"text":"I love this place it's probably my favorite bar in Tempe. Most of the places around the university are really sleazy. The atmosphere is nice. There is a beautiful courtyard and good food with reasonable prices. This place does not have the strict 21+ rules like most of the bars on Mill which makes it more pleasant for groups with people who are under age."}
{"text":"This place has the best fish and chip! It also has good vegetarian options. Love the architecture, interior, the Irish music and the beautiful garden."}
{"text":"If I could give -10 I would!! Never setting foot in this place again!! Which is very sad because this used to be a frequent handout spot!! I love the food and it used to be so fun but..... Last night my husband was slipped something in his Guinness!!! And my friend has had the same thing happened there!! Not cool not safe!! So gross that stuff like this happens but twice at the same place!!!! Beware!!!! Be safe!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the worst, the service was horrible and there was a hair in my food. DO NOT GO HERE PASS!"}
{"text":"This is one place I really enjoy to visit at lunch hour during the week. The staff is friendly, love the style of this place and the patio out back is relaxing. You can't go wrong with the fish and chips are great! I also like getting their Reuben sandwich which is good."}
{"text":"Rula Bula is a cool mellow place to go on Mill when you aren't really in the rap and hip hop music mood.   It is usually crowded on the weekends, but pretty dead during the weekdays. They have open mic a few days (tuesday for sure) and live music during the weekends. Most of the time there is a two dollar cover during the weekends.  The food is pretty good considering that irish food is pretty bland (in my opinion), but I don't go for the food.  Drinks are pretty expensive compared to other places on Mill."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. We are from out of town and are in the Scottsdale area attending spring training. We wanted to celebrate St. Patrick's day so we made reservations at Rula Bula several weeks in advance for that day. They took our reservation-- no problem. Then, three days in advance of St. Patrick's they call us and tell us they can't honor the reservations. The excuse they gave was that they shouldn't have made them in the first place. I bet, though, that they made and/or honored reservations for plenty of their regular customers. Easier to dump the out of towners than honor their reservations."}
{"text":"I had a late dinner here after a happy hour in Scottsdale. I had heard such high reviews from several people about the atmosphere, the food, the drinks, everything. I like gastropubs a lot, especially of the Irish decent. They're an aquired taste because they attract the dirty hipster type, I love the hipsters.  My first impression was Wow, they fit a pretty big restaurant inside this little place on Mill Ave. My second impression was What the hec is that smell? The entrance smells interesting. not a bad interesting, just different. Where I sat in the back stank of nursing home. It was an older building, that I appreciated, but it stank to high heaven.   I didn't order anything to drink but my food was really good. Had the St. Panciro Chicken sandwich. It came on a great big chibata bread bun and the chicken was grilled nicely with jiucy tomatoes and not-to-leafy lettuce. Mixed in was a spicey sour cream and the softest avocados I have ever had. I love avocados on a sandwich and they were wonderful with the chicken. The sweet potato fries were delicious as well, they came with a hot, spicey dipping sauce that was indeed hot and spicey! Make sure you have a glass of water.   It was a good experience for what we were looking for for the evening but I cannot say I would go back. Maybe if I was feeling hipster but the smell really turned me off."}
{"text":"Bouncer wouldn't even let me through the door because it looked like I had been drinking. What kind of person on Mill Ave at 1:30 am isn't drinking? I could understand if I was absolutely hammered but I wasn't out of control or anything. I hadn't had that much to drink. He was just a shitty bouncer at a shitty bar. Rula Bula can go get fucked."}
{"text":"I've been coming here on and off for the last year to open jam/mic night on Tuesdays. The beer selection and liquor selection is top-notch for an irish bar. Lots of whiskey and dark lagers for the irish blooded folk out there. If you enjoy live music every night, then this is your ideal place for folk and irish tunes. Don't expect the best service, but don't expect the worst either. As for the food- WOW. I love the irish nachos, and the artichoke and cheese dip is phenomenal. Not to mention the fish & chips. The only thing that ruins it is the prices. I know they rack it up because it is a college town and frequency + prices = High profit... However, it kind of sucks when I only come in twice a month and my tab is always around $60 for a beer and some food with a friend. I have never seen a manager in this place with my own two eyes, but I'm sure they are lurking somewhere. Rula Bula is 'ok' in my book, but if I'm hungry I will eat before I come here."}
{"text":"Ok. So, the service is usually slow and getting a seat can take a while on a busy night. The college crowd can be overbearing and loud. But, if you go on off hours, like lunch on a Saturday, you can sit on their beautiful patio or check out the historical interior and drink awesome whiskey and eat some amazing Irish pub foods! There hasn't been a single item on the menu I've tried that I haven't loved."}
{"text":"I've been to better, much better, pubs in my lifetime with much better atmosphere and attitudes, but... It's good when you need what they have. I have to agree that it has certainly lost a little of something in the past few years, but Rula Bula still seems to make decent fish & chips, shepherd's pie and boxty (their self-proclaimed specialty). It's on Mill, so if you're there during the weekend afternoons, expect kids. Lots and lots of kids. I like kids. I teach kids. I don't want to see kids when I go to a pub or bar. I especially don't want to see kids when I'm in Tempe sitting on the patio enjoying a smoke and a beer. But hey, it's Tempe. It's Mill on a Saturday afternoon, what the heck should I be expecting, right? Pretty much the only reason I care to come here anymore is the food (or because my mom still loves it and wants to meet up for lunch). It could use a \"new coat of paint,\" so to speak, though. And by that I mean they should try to rough up their image a little, lower their prices and stock more (better) beers."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place.  Our staple is the fish n chips, followed by a snakebite or two.  We also love the decor inside - we were told some of it was actually shipped in from Ireland.  I also like the location.  It's not too hard to get your parking battle done since it's more toward the end of Mill."}
{"text":"Come here whenever my family is in town.  The burgers are really good and the irish nachos are AWESOME!  Never came to drink so I don't know how the place stacks up as a bar."}
{"text":"Good Irish pub with all the usuals. Decent beer selection. Good food selection from traditional Irish to standard american style. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Best Irish bar in the Valley and in fact the only real Irish pub in the valley.   Period."}
{"text":"Rula has one of the most incoherent door staff ever, they are all \"career\" door guys. Pushing 40's door down. Get a life. Seconded of all, I had one of the most impersonal bartenders I think I have ever met. I'm assuming its because I didn't have a huge set of tits flopping around while drinking my blacksmith. Anyhow,  I will give it to Rula that they have some good live music-but if you make your way past the swarm of bros and hoes-you might just enjoy yourself a smidgen  All n all- not a fan."}
{"text":"What do you get when you have three senior citizens, two of whom couldn't hear a dump truck driving through a nitroglycerine factory, two middle aged parents, a 13 year old with a cell phone addiction, and two thirty-somthings who know they're better than most of you on this website? You get our little family outing to Rula Bula.  This place was great, and did an amazing job of serving our 8 person goat rodeo when we all went out as a family for dinner one Saturday night.   Food was great, drinks were free flowing and constantly topped off, and the waiter didn't start throwing things at a group that it would be a euphemism to call \"hard to serve.\"   The poor server should have known he was in for a festival of special when six of the eight of us were sitting outside due to one of the elders of the tribe insisting that 108* \"wasn't that hot\" and then continued to be grouchy because it wasn't significantly cooler inside. He was wrong about this, and I think the man might be part lizard, but we won out.   Only ding, like Sarah said before me, was the heat. Thankfully I was drinking beer, which cools my soul and warms my heart, so I was able to soldier through another family outing with our brigade.   Thanks Rula Bula, you handled your business in what could have been real nightmare."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant. I've only been here once but I had the cod and I loved it. It has a great atmosphere, not too hipster-y, and has good music too. Will definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"Rula Bula! Its a pretty cool laid back bar with a outdoor patio that rivals the size of the indoor bar. The crowd is pretty chill with a variety of different but friendly people. Within a few minutes I met a bunch of people from the NW and as far east as Philly. They had some live music as well.  The outdoor bartender (Mike) was really cool and very attentive. The food is typical bar food but it tastes really fresh and is done right. We ordered the Boxty. A thin, crepe like pancake made with potatoes and filled with heaps of braised short rib. The bartender says they cook the short rib slow and overnight. It was served with perfectly seasoned and crunchy vegetables.   Overall I think this is a cool relaxing spot in downtown Tempe. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!!! Took 30 mins for 1/2 table to get drinks and then they messed up most of them. When we asked for a manager he was supposedly \"behind the bar\"...well if the manager is that slow behind the bar he should change jobs. Food was so so."}
{"text":"Pros -  -  The food is actually really good for pub food.  Excellent shrimp pasta. -  Patio - dedicated bar, you can smoke cigars, misters and heaters -  Scotch list is extensive and reasonably priced - even for the good stuff  Cons -   -  College students pack it during the semesters - so get there early -  Inside space is small so the music is LOUD and makes talking hard.  If you go late, go for the music. -  Staff is a mixed bag.  Day staff is great - night staff seems overwhelmed frequently"}
{"text":"The bartender from Chicago was awful. He was rude and did not deserve our service. Overall we did not have a good experience at this restaurant and ended up using his tip on a bartender at another restaurant in the area. stay away."}
{"text":"My girlfriend was in from Canada, so I took her to Mill Ave...we hit a lot of places, but this was by far the best. Awesome staff and selections!"}
{"text":"I proposed to my wife here. The staff was awesome and helped me out with the whole thing. We both thoroughly enjoyed our appetizer, entrée (shepherds pie), and dessert. The drinks were great and not overly priced. I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"I love Rula Bula, Lamb Stew is the best! Also, great fish fry. I am disappointed that they choose to charge a $2 cover on some nights. I went there last night to have a Guinness and some dessert, but they want a $2 cover because they have some lousy band playing to a mostly empty bar. I wanted to sit on the patio with my wife, but I am not willing to pay $2 to go into a place like Rula Bula. I know it is only $2, but come on...  Also, great patio atmosphere!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot on Mill Ave. The food is amazing, and their alcohol selection is premium. THe atmosphere is great between their indoor area that has live bands, as well as their large outdoor patio. Great place to chill out and have a few drinks with friends. Definitely recommend if you're looking for something a bit different than the usual bar."}
{"text":"If I have to choose a bar on Mill avenue - Rula Bula I choose you! They've got a good selection of beer, food, and plenty of space. They typically have a cover on the weekends. On scheduled nights they have live Celtic music."}
{"text":"A disclaimer- yes, I went to ASU. Yes, I've been to Mill a few times. Did I know Rula Bula was anything more than a basic bar? Not really- not until I started reading an urban fantasy series written by local guy and all around cool gentleman named Kevin Hearne. It's especially fun being a native reading a book by a native, because protagonist's shop is on Mill, and is bookended by stores that actually do exist. He lives in Tempe, just south of ASU, and he's got his own favorite joints to eat at. All of which are local.  Which is also where Rula Bula comes in. Because apparently they make \"the best fish and chips in town\". Fish and chips? The best? Are you sure??? I had to check it out. Problem is I live and work in North Phoenix now. Trips out to Mill are few and far between. Until I went out there for a photoshoot. Voila, perfect reason to go eat there.  Now I did NOT get the fish and chips. But my husband did, and holy cannoli, they are good. Crispy and light, tender on the inside. I got the braised beef & Guinness boxty. Because I'd heard about boxtys before, but what WERE they? Are they good? Could you really go wrong with beef slow braised in Guiness? The answer, wee bairns, is no. Holy cannoli did I mention it was good? Savory and rich with a hint of bitterness. And a boxty is a bit like a crepe. It was stuffed with the meat, and you ripped it apart with your fork (no knife really needed), and shoveled this goodness into your mouth. My girlfriend got the shepherd's pie, and you know it's a good place when they master the classics. I'm not sure I've ever tasted a shepherd's pie this good.   The drinks menu was also pretty cool- I always enjoy trying out whatever craft cocktails they claim to have. Mine was... okay. I just remember really loving my girlfriend's. I tried looking at the website to jog my memory but can't find a drinks menu. Suffice to say it was warm and appley and had a stick of cinnamon to stir with. This was right around Thanksgiving time and there was a bit of a chill in the wind outside, so it was just absolutely perfect.   My vote? Absolutely go to Rula Bula, and do yourself a favor and skip the drunken frat crowd. Go early enough so you can get dinner, because to me that's where this place really shines."}
{"text":"I like it a lot. Only negative is it's location brings along the general 'Mill' BS that's unbecoming an Irish pub (dumb rules to keep collage kids in line and whatnot)  Otherwise, great service, great food, great drinks. A nice place to be :D"}
{"text":"I went here craving fish and chips as well as the well-worn comfortable atmosphere that one expects from a good Irish pub.   The menu said that the fish and chips were voted \"best in Phoenix\" and sited the fresh made batter as the key to the dish's quality. With my expectations raised, I settled in to enjoy the two-piece meal.   It was ok. The breading, while definitely different from other places, did not add that much to the fish. In fact, it was actually pretty thin which meant that it did not stand up to the weight of the fish. I had to resort immediately to a knife and fork. Most people probably eat fish and chips that way by default, but personally, I like to eat this type of meal with my fingers. The fish was slightly over-cooked, but still tasted good.  The atmosphere was a little on the chain side of of the spectrum, but Rula Bula has enough of the pub staples to be comfortable. The service staff were very friendly.  All in all, I'd go again. If you are looking for a an Irish Pub experience in Tempe, Rula Bula will serve you well. However, if they really do have the best fish and chips in Phoenix, then the bar is not insurmountably high."}
{"text":"I have frequented Rula Bula for a few years now and it is hard to pin point just one thing that keeps me coming back.  The food is great as is the service and I love the authentic feel of this Irish pub with it's odd ball, mismatched tables and Guinness decor.    I typically order the corned beef sandwich on rye and it is sublime.  The three cheese grilled cheese sandwich is also very, very good.  While some feel that the beer selection leaves a lot to be desired I have never really seen it as a problem.   My only complaints about this establishment are their lack of a \"true\" happy hour and the crowd that sometimes fills it's patio.  On a few occasions the patio bar has been occupied by some of the scummy mill crowd which is a disappointment as this is normally a great place.   I would highly recommend Rula Bula to anyone looking for some great Irish grub at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"The best Irish pub in Tempe! Stop by for the open mic on Tuesdays, they've got some good singers there! The bartender Casey really makes the place awesome"}
{"text":"This place was delicious.  The food was great and very tasteful, the drinks were strong (and they came out quickly too), and the staff was very friendly and helpful.  I was quite surprised."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best experience with a bar/restaurant I have ever had on mill. Most Mill ave bars don't give a rats ass about the people who stay at the border, but Rula Bula's bartenders are highly social. The outdoor bar allows smoking cigars, which won me completely over since I have been thrown out of other bars on mill that allow smoking in the patio areas but apparently despise cigars. The atmosphere inside is quite amazing with an extremely welcoming feel, not to mention the food is the best I've had from a restaurant in a while."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome!  I really enjoy the atmosphere on the outside back deck.  They have an excellent hoice of middle and top end whiskey.  Ask for Desiree.  She is awesome.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"We love the Irish inspired pub themes, and Rula Bula is a great place to get that. My husband and I usually order a salad each and 1 Fish and Chips plate then split it because the portion is very large. The Fish and Chips comes with tartar sauce and malted vinegar if you like it that way. It is a great dish to drink with a Guiness!  Nestled in the heart of Tempe, when you feel like getting a little culture down on Mill, Rula Bula fits the bill for both food and fun."}
{"text":"A friend of mine plays there on Mondays...so we wanted to surprise him and go watch him play.  So I called about 3pm to find out what time he goes on.  Here's how the conversation went:  Me: **ring ring** Rula: This is Steve Me: Hello is the Rula Bula Rula: Yeah Me:  I was just wondering what time Shelby goes on tonight? Rula: I don't even know.  Probably 9, 9:30, 10 Me: Can you get me someone who can find out? Rula: No, there are no managers here. (He hung up at this point)  I don't know about you, but that was not customer service at all.   So I waited an hour, called again.  This time got a girl.  I knew she would be better then the last guy cause she answered the phone...\"Thank you for calling Rula Bula.  How can I help you.\"  Much better then, \"This is steve\".   She told me exactly what time Shelby went on and let me know that they serve food til 10p.  So we got there about 8:30p.  Ordered drinks and food.  Was enjoying ourselves until the server came over and told us she was going to have to close our tab because she was leaving.  That is one of my biggest pet peeves, when I am forced to close my tab cause that person wants to go home.  Why can't my tab just be transfered to someone else?    So we're enjoying music and the bartender comes to clear our glasses and my friend ask her if he could have another stella.  She doesn't say anything and just walks away.  15 mins later we're looking for her to find out about the stella, we make eye contact with her from our table and motion for the stella.  She points to the end of the bar.  Apparently she served it when we ordered it and then just left it at the bar and never said anything to us.    I used to like hanging out at Rula Bula, but it seems that lately it's gotten expensive and the service has gone to shit.  I don't know why they tell you that the pints of beer at $4.50, when they are actually $5.50.  I won't go back anytime soon.  I'll stick to Fibbers and The HatRack Pub."}
{"text":"Went to Rula on an ASU football game Friday.  I don't think they put an ounce of thought into their business levels or needs of their customers.  I get there and the front entrance is closed off and there is a sign that says to use another entrance.  The arrow pointed in one direction but the entrance was actually in the back so there's one fail for directing traffic.  I finally get to the back entrance and it's understandably busy.  The bar on the patio is swamped so I expected to wait a minute to put in a drink order.  I stood there for 5 minutes (timed) and it wasn't until a female friend of mine walked over (didn't wave or draw attention to herself, just simply walked up) that we were acknowledged and asked what we needed.  Coincidence?  Not sure and I don't care!  We get our drinks and when it was time for round 2, I waited 9, yes, 9 minutes to order.  Again, same friend walked up and viola, \"what can I get you guys?\".  The bartenders seemed friendly enough but they had ZERO sense of urgency and apparently had some fixation with the right side of the bar because they were helping existing and new customers over there while I waited.  One guy (older) who was bartending and was moving at a snail's pace.  This held up the other guys from pouring their drinks so to pass the time along, they were all joking around with each other instead of acknowledging their customers (yours truly) and letting us know it would be a minute.  Laughable.  Another couple were waiting and discussing how bad the service was as well.  They got so irritated they ordered their drinks, slammed them down and left.  If you're looking for a low key place to get a drink, I would only recommend this spot if it's dead slow or if every other bar on Mill is closed!  PASS!"}
{"text":"Nice spacious pub, and a real pub not a bar that calls itself a pub.  The fish & chips are good."}
{"text":"Hands down the best fried fish ever! The chips weren't my favorite, but that cod was amazing! The artichoke dip was stupid good, and Liz made our trip amazing!"}
{"text":"Love love love the Irish chips in the curry sauce!!!  I could eat it forever and never get tired of it- so good!  Mainly, it's the curry sauce that makes it so good.  Fish and chips are also great!"}
{"text":"Love this traditional Irish pub.  Food was good and the atmosphere was great!"}
{"text":"Had a pretty larger group to celebrate St Patrick's Day a day early on St Paddy's Eve as many were traveling the next day.  Sat outside and were promptly greeted and drink orders taken and served.    Apps came out quickly but not all at once.  Orders were taken and plates came out sporadically as well. with 4-5 being served then a few more etc.  By the time the last plate reached the table the first group was almost finished eating.  The waitress was quite attentive and apologetic claiming there were issues with the kitchen.  She could sense our frustration and disappointment.  The manager came over and confirmed there were issues wit the kitchen not preparing orders as received.  He more than took care of our inconvenience on our bill.  Great beer selection and menu options with some very solid Irish Pub style dishes being offered.  I had the fish and chips which was very good.  Several in the group ordered other traditional Irish fare and all were pleased with the choice.  Had a couple in the group with solid Irish heritage and they even commented that they were supposed at how good the dishes were.  Would certainly go back but call ahead if you have a larger group so the staff can plan accordingly."}
{"text":"2 stars for the fat smelly man who is ALWAYS there inside when I'm there (and who I constantly end up walking past all night) 5 stars for the fabulous patio 4 stars for the crazy, cute Irishmen my girlfriend and I stupidly offered a ride back to their hotel  1 star for the crazy Irishmen who wouldn't get the fuck out of my car 5 stars for the time my girlfriend made a paper towel \"scarf\" in the bathroom and paraded around the patio all night  Average that up?  3.5  (Total guess...you do the math.  I'll give the benefit of the doubt and round to 4)"}
{"text":"My husband took me here during a rare event we get to eat a meal together.  Food was amazing (could have been the company I had with me too), but I got an enormous salad, which was absolutely wonderful.  Way to go!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed myself the few times I've been here at the Rula. It's a great change of pace from the Landon & Candace frat/sorority show up and down the rest of the strip. I didn't have any service issues sitting at the bar, nothing out of the ordinary on a crowded weekend night.   It IS a place where friends just hang out with beers in their hand, sometimes trying to jig to the catchy Celtic bands playing the middle. On Halloween, my friends and I were out in the back patio and a girl in the tower of the adjoining hotel gave everyone down below a nice stripshow. Bonus star.  I guess the downside of the bar is with the high ceilings and bright lights it doesn't have that authentic Irish pub feel, but who am I kidding.   We're in Tempe.   Which also means smoke-free Irish bar, and until May rolls around, Rula definitely has the leg up on the two McCaffrey's...  4 Stars."}
{"text":"Over the last year, I've noticed a rapid decline in the quality of service at Rula Bula. It used to be my favorite place to wash away my college woes, but now I don't ever want to go back.  On a Friday night in May I was out celebrating a friend's birthday with a group of 10-12 people. We were all ordering food, booze and overall having an excellent time. When time comes to mosey on home, the waitress informs me that my credit card has been lost. Problem #1: If a guest's credit card is lost, a manager should always come discuss this with the guest, not the server.  The waitress, Maddie, was horrified and worried, and suggested I leave my phone number with her so if she found it she could call me. She also gave me a comped beer, which I later found out wasn't comped but a beer she paid for herself. True true to her word I received a phone call shortly after close that night. For a variety of reasons, I was unable to pick up my card for a few days. Because of this Rula Bula put a pending charge on my credit card for $25 because my card was \"left overnight\".  Problem #2: management. In conversing with the manager via email, I received excuses, and was told several times that I was wrong about the credit card charges about which I complained, even after verifying them multiple times with my card company. In my emails I also listed several shortcomings I had noticed regarding the level of service, and received absolutely no input from the manager.  There's no excuse for poor service, lost cards, non-comped drinks after such an egregious mistake, and no real apology. The managers really don't seem to care, which is an attitude that rubs off on many of the employees, save for Maddie.   I'm sad to say goodbye to the best Guinness in town, but I simply can't keep justifying the poor service and lack of concern for customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed this place when I'm down in Tempe on Mill. Once I found out it was Pat Tillman's favorite hangout when he was in school at ASU it just added to the greatness."}
{"text":"The Shepherd's Pie is fantastic, I have tried a few different Irish places and I think Rula Bula has had the best so far. The irish chips are something I'd go back to snack on, they are pretty filling on their own. Service is good, though the place can get pretty crowded. But that is just a given when it comes to Mill ave. Their Irish coffee is perfect for the cold weather, they had a few different options. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a hardy meal."}
{"text":"We came in here for an Early dinner one day. For once I did not have a hard time finding a parking spot.  Beautifully decorated place inside. Very much like a place in Ireland. Just a lot cleaner, because, it is newer. Even down to the Lace curtains.  The food was good, really good. Very true to Irish Food. Not something that everyone likes. But, since I grew up with the Ish food. I like it. Our service was good, Everything was hot (food) which is another plus.  They do offer Free wifi, which I did not use, but if you needed it....... After dinner we sat outside on the enclosed patio area. To listen to live music which was also nice. They allow smoking on the patio. If you are into that. I would absolutely go back to eat again."}
{"text":"This place is one of a kind on mill. I always consider this place my first or last stop of the night.  Never does Rula Bula bore me or ever get old. The staff are real friendly, the manager is knowledgeable  on transactions, their products and is very helpful. Had an incident once where I had trouble with the way my debit card was setup. Immediately I was helped by the manager then next day when i called it in, since my bank is of no help.lol.  Anyways, overall finger food is fairly good, drinks are from.bottom to top shelf, environment and entertainment is soo kick back. Rula Bula, my go-to place."}
{"text":"This little Irish pub was so much fun on St . Patrick day. Loved the Shepard pie and my daughter loved the fish and chips. Been to many Irish pubs in Ireland and in other states. Really enjoyed the how it was sunny and not so dark.  Hope to go there again!"}
{"text":"This is a Mill Avenue classic! They brought the bar from Ireland, you really feel like you are ina traditional pub in here. There is a large outdoor patio with fulll bar for smokers and on those lovely nights. They have heaters. Inside there is a large bar and a dining room with an eclectic assortment of tables.  FOOD and drink: They have a number of traditional dishes, but I am sorry to say that noe have been outstanding enough to make me come back for the food. But, they do have Smithwick's and many other great beers and whiskeys so come in for a drink and live music. They have different music each night, always something fun!"}
{"text":"Large portions but nothing too exciting beyond that.  Good beer selection on tap and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here on Easter based on the recommendations of friends for their Fish & Chips (for my mumsie).  I had been here a few times before, but only had appetizers and drinks.    Mom liked the fish & chips, said it tasted like a tempura batter, I don't like fish so I didn't try them to know.  The chips here are awesome...they're cut like a really thick potato chip which I ordered as an appetizer, but wouldn't have had I known those were the same type of \"chips\" coming with my mom's meal.  The tartar sauce, I'm sure is made in -house so it does have dill in it, which it looked like the fish batter did also.  I didn't care for the tartar sauce but mums didn't oppose it.    Also I was asked if I wanted the appetizer chips to come out first, which I did because we were starving, but everything came out at the same time.  So for $6, it's a good appetizer, but not when you're already getting it with your meal.  The lunch sized portion was just right with 2 good sized pieces of fish, a side of cole slaw, and the chips for $9 (served before 4:00pm).  The chips also come with this delicious sauce which I would kind of describe as a fancier version of 1000 island.  Delicious!  I ordered the Shepherd's Pie, which I was somewhat apprehensive about after reading the reviews, but I thought it was pretty good.  It lacked salt, but I'd rather something lack salt and be able to add more than vice versa.  The presentation was absolutely marvelous, and the potatoes on top were to die for.  It was served with a side salad, also a lunch special for $9. I could have substituted \"chips\" for the salad if I wanted, which, again, I would have done had realized what I was doing.    Service was fairly quick, which it should have been as we were one of about 3 tables in the whole place, and our server was very friendly.  The Guiness brownie looked tempting, but I had a Snake-bite with lunch and that always makes me too full to even finish my meal.    All in all, a decent meal and I would definitely return again, but based on the fish and chips alone, Mums and I decided we're going to try another place next time."}
{"text":"Delighted to have found another 5-star restaurant in Tempe. Fish and chips and mac n cheese were outstanding. Excellent friendly and attentive service. Selection of drinks seemingly endless (Try Killian's Red cream ale on draft!) I'll be back to try their other specialties. I really enjoyed this place even more than the fabled (and incomparably expensive) House of Tricks."}
{"text":"My favorite things about Rula Bula: the outdoor patio at night, and the mac n' cheese! The menu, overall, is a bit pricier than you'd expect from the location, being that it's on Mill with the hundreds of drunk ASU students that crawl the street every weekend, but the food really is just great! However, the service is sub-par. Almost every time I've been here, there's been at least one issue (lack of waiters, waiting too long for drinks, waiters nowhere to be found, etc.)"}
{"text":"Rula Bula all 3x I've been have each been very different experience. The first was a St Patty's Day & busy, busy, busy out on the patio. No table, no chair just chilling with friends. That was my first good experience there. So naturally I went back. Landed at the bar inside this time & at happy hour. Me & my PIC consumed some HH concoctions but moved on for dinner else where because neither of us felt like partaking in anything too heavy. But still had a good drink at HH & helpful staff tending the bar. The 3rd time was on a gorgeous Saturday night. We were in Tempe for an event at the lake. So we tried the patio bar for HH food & $1 off beers on tap. The sliders we tried were good & the beer cold. This place is A-Ok but I'm gonna have to just come in starving to try the food sometime soon. Everything that went by looked tasty. Stay tuned."}
{"text":"I love this spot. The potato balls are my favorite and the live music is always great.   The manager Brandon was very accommodating with some mishaps with our late lunch so we will be back!"}
{"text":"Formerly a favorite, definitely gone downhill.  Primarily due to managers who seem to feel like they are doing you a favor by allowing you to spend your money, and oh yes, its a lot of money.  You want a real Irish Pub, go to Casey Moore's and skip the attitude"}
{"text":"This place used to rock. I come here every once and a while to enjoy a great time, however, I had the unfortunate experience of meeting Lindsay the cocktail waitress. Her appalling service and pretentious attitude was more than enough to make me never want to come back here again. And if that wasn't enough she said I was a fire hazard by standing 10 feet from the door, AND LATER she told me to expect bad service by asking directions to the restroom. I no longer consider this the Tempe Ireland experience , as I remember that country had nice people. Next time I'll just head to the fox."}
{"text":"Ahh-yes. You either get it.... or you don't.   Rula Bula is one of the BEST, and most genuine places to hang in the Tempe/S Scottsdale area. The food is always there- and it's surprisingly good Pub fare, but what this place sells most successfully is soulful ambience, a down-to-earth yet diverse  crowd, interesting live music, a gorgeous patio, and a cool-as-hell waitstaff. That's the hook.  It's the kind of place where women get up and dance to live music because they're actually moved to \"get down\". Not that there isn't a little frontin' and narcissistic booty-shaking going on, but it feels very balanced and chill, because everyone else is either lounging in beat-up  wooden booths, hanging out in a laid back fashion on the patio, or tucked away in an intimate corner somewhere.  It's also a place where alot of people pass through on their way to somewhere else for the evening, and is nestled against an upscale hotel- so if you're into people watching, there are always fresh faces. The staff is very cool and keeps things on the upbeat overall. It's a great time, and cool place to meet other cool people. ."}
{"text":"Another bad case of poor door managers. Nathanael is a b* and doesn't know what's up. Other than this little door man complaint the Irish car bombs are 2 legit 2 quit"}
{"text":"I loved the beer garden here!  My girlfriend and I met up with some friends here during a coast-to-coast road trip.  It was our first time in Tempe, and a good time it was!  We got to the bar just as it was starting to get busy on a Friday night.  Our intentions were to have one drink and then go back to our hotel to get a good night's sleep, but the atmosphere held us in and we couldn't leave!  Unfortunately, we couldn't party too hard since we had to continue on our trip early the next morning, but we could easily see ourselves having too much fun here.    We didn't have any of the food and mostly chilled outside where it was starting to get crowded, but the bartenders were attentive.  There was a live band playing cover songs in a polka-style inside, and a bunch of people were dancing and having a good old time.  We will certainly remember to hit up this place if we ever revisit Tempe!"}
{"text":"Rula Bula is a really fun place.  I like the crowd, the music (reggae cover band) was great, and nothing is overpriced.  Our server was extremely friendly as well.  The Irish chips are soooooooooooo good!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Rula Bula. I love Irish Pubs, and Rula puts on all the airs of being one, but decor aside, it never really completely fills the bill for me.  The drinks are good, the food is decent (love the oysters Rockefeller!) but the atmosphere has never really drawn me in. Maybe its because its on Mill, but I never see this as the kind of place I could hang out for more than an evening once every few months.  Still, if you're on the north end of MIll Ave and need a properly poured pint of the black stuff and a decent whiskey to go along with it, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Rula Bula gets five stars from me for two reasons:  #1 Perfect fish and chips. #2 One of the only correctly poured Guinness drafts in AZ.  They could punch me in the neck when I walked in, and i would still give them five stars for those two reasons.  Almost all the food is good (though I can count the number of times I've had anything other than the above on one hand). The happy hour is great, with half off appetizers, including the fish nuggets, which are the fish 'n' chips I eat before I eat the fish 'n' chips.  The world's most competitive trivia night. These people STUDY for trivia night.   Great outdoor seating, good service. Decor is interesting, especially if you like this particular famous race horse that I currently forget the name of but is the subject of approximately 90% of the wall art."}
{"text":"Tony served us tonight on the patio. She gave us great recommendations and all of us were very happy with what we ordered. Was impressed with the service, the portions, and the quality of the food. And the patio with the variety of music was very enjoyable. Haven't been here in a while, but will definitely be coming back.  Thanks for providing a great evening for myself and my out of state visitors."}
{"text":"This review is heightened by their selection of alcohol on tap.  I am a Magners kind of girl.  Therefore, this place makes me very happy.  We had dinner here last night, the food leaves much to be desired.  Not sure when they won best fish & chips, but they're not very good.  I'm looking forward to trying some other places.  Overall, I think Rula Bula is worth it for happy hour drinks and apps, but not for an actual meal.  It's not much like an actual Irish pub, which is depressing.  I love pubs, and this doesn't meet the mark."}
{"text":"Doing some errands and saw Rula Bula.  I like irish dishes especially shepherd's pie.  Shepard's pie it is.  Waiter told me it also comes with sides including french fries or mac and cheese for an upgrade.  French fries when shepherd's pie has a mashed potato topping?  Nope.  mac and cheese?  It would be a disappointment (my readers know that I am Queen of the mac and cheese-don't ask for the recipe please.  It is as secret as the IRS lost emails.)   I also had a choice of soup.  Leek/potato or french onion soup.  Leek & potato it is.  Nice irish soup until I tasted it.  Two large pieces of RAW POTATOES in the middle of a not so stellar watery soup base.  Tasted oniony but not good oniony.  Like onion soup mix with leeks in it.  Well, regardless of this, people don't eat raw potatoes unless you are camping out in the woods and the flame gives out.  (Can you tell I love camping?)   The waiter took it back and gave me french onion soup.  Much better.  Quite nice as a matter of fact.  Next, the shepherd's pie.  The top of it is usually put inside a broiler (a salamander in restaurant talk) to give it a nice color.  Not so.  This was very blonde.  Doesn't mean it's not going to be good right?  Right.  Actually it was pretty good.  The sirloin inside was not greasy and with the veggies in it it was quite a nice interplay.  So would I order it again?  Yeah, maybe but this time with a Guiness or a Sam Adam's beer.  I was driving and didn't want to take a chance with having the Tempe or Scottsdale cops give me a breathalyzer so a nice cold glass of water accompanied my meal instead.  No carbonated drinks (not good for your bones-bet you didn't know that! ).   Service was fine..  Despite the fact that it was a Wednesday night, they had quite a clientele.   Glad I tried it.  I was always curious about the place.  Now I know."}
{"text":"Second time here and I will continue to visit. The oysters taste amazingly fresh. The bacon wrapped shrimp is so delicious with the bacon grease. The Shepards pie was great to share. And the fish and chips are definitely fresh. Good drinks, good service, good food. A must to go!"}
{"text":"First visit and want be the last. From the time I walked in I was treated like I was the only person there. Service was A-1 and the plate at the end of my meal was as clean as it was when it came out of the dishwasher,  hahaha. The shepards pie was first-class!  Devine was the young lady who delivered phenomenal service. Thank you!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are from Las Vegas and was in Tempe to see the Arizona St./Utah game.   We just like to compliment your staff for an outstanding pre game dinner.  Despite being busy, we found a table in the quart yard and were greeted very quickly.  Server  was fast in getting our drinks and food orders.  Food came out in a timely manner and tasted great.  We were able to enjoy the meal and not have to rush to the game.  Both my wife and I have worked in the food serve industry and enjoy seeing good service.  Being locals here in Vegas, too often see customer service take a back seat to making money.   It was refreshing to see your staff work so hard and provide such good service.  Please forward our compliments to you staff.  We will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place. The wait staff and bartenders have always been great whenever we go.  I usually take my friends here when they come in from out of town as it's a bit of a haul from my house.  The patio is one of the best places to have a  Guinness in Tempe.  Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"First time here, and our party of 8 had great service on the patio. Out table was ready a little before the time of our reservation which was great for those of us who got there a little early. Loved our server, who is a fan of the restaurant and engaged to one of the cooks. Everyone loved their wine, and the prices are reasonable event at happy hour. Everyone also loved the spinach artichoke dip which was NOT run of the mill at all. Our server was able to get cucumber slices for the GF contingent, and was so nice nice about the ask!  My son said the fish and chips was the best he has had anywhere. He's a teenager, and after the two piece dinner, he was too full for dessert. My friend's kale quinoa salad was amazing (she reluctantly shared a bite with me). The Dublin Irish Cheddar garlic dressing on my wedge salad was so incredible, I asked to buy some to take home.  The Rule Bula Irish Coffee was such a great dessert on a January evening, especially poured over the vanilla ice cream that came with my friend's delicious apple cobbler.  Looking forward to taking my other son to try the fish and chips and to just enjoy another evening on the patio!"}
{"text":"While in Arizona for watching the Angels in Spring Training, we found this great Irish pub! The vegan shepards pie was tasty with the Irish pub chips which were addicting. The fish and chips were really good, too according to my better half. The atmosphere was great because of the decor. Lastly, there is a coupon for free parking for two hours. Make sure you go into the restaurant for the instructions before you pay!"}
{"text":"Ah Rúla Búla.  How far you have fallen in recent years.  What once was a warm, friendly and enjoyable \"home pub\" venue has changed over the last several years into a disorganized and seemingly mismanaged establishment.  If you are in any way familiar with Mill Avenue and Tempe, you likely know about and have been to Rúla Búla.  It is a literal cornerstone of social and gastronomic life on Mill Avenue in Tempe. Having worked in Tempe for nigh on 15 years now, I've been a patron here for many a year.  Once the highlight of an office outing or a simple lunch with a friend or co-worker, the last several visits here have resulted in poor service and mediocre food.    We have a fairly large group to accommodate (10-15 people) and as such, always call ahead to make reservations.  Our last trip here at least started better than the last few (in which they completely forgot/ignored our reservations and ended up having to wait for them to clear customers and tables for us).  The tables were indeed ready for us upon the specified arrival time.  I was somewhat glad that we were on the back patio area, as the interior of the restaurant itself was overly warm.  Our reservation was for 15 and 14 of us were there within a few minutes of each other.  Drinks were fairly prompt, though all at the table commented that their drinks (from soda to water) all had an odd taste to them.  Perhaps the ice had been tainted with something?  Also the soda's were all very flat and watery.    We then proceeded to wait a good 20-30 minutes awaiting someone to return to our table and begin taking orders.  We finally flagged down one of the servers and his comment was along the lines of, \"Oh, are you ready to order?\"  Now, it's possible that they were waiting for our last person to show up.  Maybe.  However, any seasoned server knows that group luncheons are a dynamic event.  There are often times less or more than what the reservation is made for.  Some show up late, some leave early.  If it was in question, a simple \"Are you all waiting for someone or are you ready to order\" a few minutes into our arrival (like when they delivered the drinks) would have resolved this.    When a server finally did attend our table, his greeting was prefaced with the suggestion that we split our entire tab into 15 equal amounts to make it easier and faster for him to process upon completion of our meal.  Never in the whole of my gastrological life has a server suggested that we structure our payment in a fashion that is more convenient for them.  Be that as it may, we quickly discussed it and agreed to this.  We had already been there some time and as it was a work luncheon, didn't have a limitless amount of time.    Orders were taken and then the next long wait began.  An hour after arriving, our 15th member joined us and we still did not have our food.  Unfortunate or fortunate?  At least he got to eat with us, right?    Shortly after this, our food arrived.  For myself, I ordered the bangers and mash.  Pretty traditional dish for irish pub food.  Three half portions of bangers, served on a bed of mash with a red onion gravy.  Back in the day, my favorite choice here was actually their Pub Whiskey Burger.  They made a pub whiskey sauce that was phenomenal.  Sadly, it was removed from their menu a few years ago.    The bangers and mash is normally quite good but today it was fairly blasé.  The sausages themselves were okay, could have used a bit more searing.  The mash was good but not very flavorful.  The gravy had no signs of onion in it.  And normally this dish is served with either the vegetable of the day or brussels sprouts with apples.  For some odd reason, mine came with... irish chips.  Sliced, fried potatoes to accompany my already sizable portion of mashed potatoes.    Curious choice for certain.  If there had been a question as to what I wanted, they should have asked me.  Under normal circumstances I would have asked for the normal veggies or sprouts to accompany my meal, but this long into the lunch, it just didn't seem worth the fuss.    Once we left, we pretty unanimously agreed that this was likely the last group luncheon that we would be having here.  It's sad to see such a storied establishment fall into disarray and mediocrity.  I hope they can make adjustments and improve.  Taken from their website, \"Irish pubs are a retreat from the real world and at the heart of Rúla Búla is the ready smile, the invitation to relax and enjoy good conversation, great food and drink, hospitality and humour.\"  This has not been our experience here in some time.  There is a lot of competition on Mill, which is only growing with the improving economy.  Robbie Fox's down the street has new ownership and will be re-opening as Public House on Third.  It also happens to be right next to our office building.  Where once we journeyed to the opposite end of Mill Avenue to patronize Rúla Búla, we may find ourselves having our luncheons a bit closer to home."}
{"text":"Good place to go if you a fans of Irish type of beer and/or any types of dark/thick beer.  I can't really handle the dark beer so I tend to not go there if I don't have to.  They do charge covers to get in, so be sure to shell some more of your beer money for that, usually $10 and a long line especially on the weekends.  I would rather save my money for somewhere else."}
{"text":"My girl friend had corned beef and cabbage and I had shepherds pie. I asked the server if the potatoes were real. She said yes. Wow, worse than powdered potatoes. Whatever happened to this place? The corned beef was ghastly and the shepherds pie ass dreadful. Years ago this place was awesome. What happened?"}
{"text":"The best Fish and Chips I've ever had.  The atmosphere inside the restaurant is inviting and friendly and the prices are all reasonable."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite spot on Mill because of the live music on the weekends, generally fun atmosphere. I've usually gone later in the evening when they have someone out front checking IDs. I understand that while being so close to the university they have to scrutinize as to not compromise their business, but MY GOD. And the guy was SO RUDE. He insisted my ID didn't look like me (I had shorter hair in the photo), so I pulled out my military ID which had a more recent photo. He was just as rude to my friend and brother while checking their IDs, treating us as though we were trying to get away with something. My friend is 29, my brother is 25, and I'm 26...never had such an issue trying to have a good time.   Once we were on the patio with drinks in hand, the same douchebag was going table to table RECHECKING IDs, interrupting everyone's good time.  He came to our table, my brother have him his ID AGAIN, and the dude harassed him for 5 minutes claiming the photo didn't look like him.  The only difference, literally, was that my brother was wearing his glasses that night. We finished our one drink and left. As I walked out, I thanked Mr. Power Trip for ruining our experience and he only have me a dirty look.  I wanted to channel Leslie Mann and scream, \"you're nothing but a door man! Door man! DOOR MAN!!!\" But he wasn't worth another minute of my life. Will not go back because of door man."}
{"text":"The best Irish pub in Arizona hands down. Tons of history here as it was built out of an old saddlery."}
{"text":"Luckily I came here in the summer, so I've missed all the frat-guy chodes.    I love me some Irish pubs, but somehow Rula Bula is lacking.  I can't really place it.   It's nowhere close to feel that emanates from Rosie McCaffreys, Casey Moores or Dubliners.   At those places you can't mistake the environs.  I think Omer is right on re: the lighting, ceilings and decor here.  I really like the fish and chips here - especially the quarter inch think round potato chips.   Paired with a pint of Harp, and I was a happy camper.   Service was ok - neither fast nor quick.  But after the second beer, the server brought out the check before asking if we'd like another.  wtf?"}
{"text":"I really like this place a lot.  They have a great happy hour menu with a lot of small plate choices.  It looks small from the front, but it is quite large.  I really enjoy the patio out back.  Plenty of heaters for cold nights.  Food was very delicious!  Can't wait till the next time I hide my bike to rula bula.  Also patio is ultra dog friendly so that is an extra point for me!"}
{"text":"Lotsa reviews about this already so not sure what this will all mean.  Had the fish and chips (voted Best in something or another).  In short, fish was pretty juicy and got 2 fairly large pieces, but the batter was a bit doughy in that by the time I got around to eating my 2nd piece, the outside wasn't so crispy/crunchy.  A bit more of the tempura batter feel to it than, say, the harder/crispy coating on H. Salt or something.  Taste was good but got a bit soggy as it sat.  The chips were cool.  Not fries but potato discs.  In that sense, more like American potato chips (fish & chips, get it?) but thick cut, much thicker than a kettle cooked chip.  Good and crispy on the outside, but starchy potato on the inside.  I liked 'em.  Also had the mussels which were cooked in a thin alfredo-ey type of sauce.  Pretty good.  And these Spicy Bollix potato balls--I thought they'd be like potato hush puppies or whatnot but they were much bigger and as it turns out, quite wet/gooey on the inside.  Seemed like fried poi.  But, they were quite spicy (definitely not traditional Irish here) and tasty, too.  I'd recommend a go.  Ambience was a faux, rustic pub feel but there was a live band playing later and they rocked some Pogues and Flogging Molly pretty well."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday. The food was good, but the service was so-so. We were not given silverware or napkins till after the food was served, and we had to ask for them. The patio was great though! I could definitely see myself going there for a beer after work."}
{"text":"wow, was i pleasantly surprised at this little place. i initially thought it was just a pub, but on top of a lengthy bar, it also had some choice seating for restaurant patrons. reportedly, they know how to serve a thick beer and every great import is on tap. as luck would have it, i happened upon this place while there was a very talented live band that made it possible to watched the Irish jiggers do their... uh... jig. it was pretty crowded and my party of six couldn't find a seat anywhere.  the place was overrun by overly-euro looking men, all in their 6'5\" frames and no shorter. my Mexican friend was the only distinctly American-looking person in the place. the place had such great ambiance that we stayed until last call. Honestly, this place is a jewel on Mill Ave."}
{"text":"This place definitely wow'd me!  I'm a California native and I was in Tempe for a wedding and me and fiance came here on two occasions, for lunch and late night drinks. For lunch we decided to visit this place, since it was so close to our hotel.  It was fairly quiet in there so we got seated and helped immediately.  Our server did a great job making sure we were happy and satisfied.  I believe her name was Rachel, very talkative lively lady, kudos to her for doing a good job. The next day we came here with a bunch of friends for some late night drinks.  All I can say was it was busy!  But I particularly liked the environment and feel of the place.  There was a live band rocking out to keep everyone entertained, the outside patio was alive with people but we all managed to find a great spot to chill out at.  The servers were incredibly polite and made sure everyone had a drink and didn't have to wait.  They also were very quick to clean up empty mugs. Overall some really good service here!  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the Tempe area."}
{"text":"good afternoon buzz with my girl.  it was ok.  I didn't eat or drink, so no star no star, but if I had, I am sure it would have been good.  thanks for the restroom stop, for that, you get 5 stars. and my girlie had wine."}
{"text":"This place is a winner...Outstanding fish and chips, perfection in my book!  Excellent service, fun atmosphere...Bread pudding was awesome as well...Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I was here for the first time last St. Patty's Day. We didn't eat, and the place was pretty crowded (as expected), but it was a good time and the Guinness was perfect.  Then, I ate there a month or so later. The food was awesome. The fish and chips were the best I have ever had. And that's not even my favorite meal.  The outside patio was comfortable and the staff was attentive.   I'm looking forward to eating there again very soon. And perhaps partaking in some Guinness-drinking again for St. Pat's Day."}
{"text":"The fish and chips were the best I've ever had. I went on a Saturday night (around 6) and was seated immediately. They do the perfect pints which is cool since they are an Irish themed restaurant. I will come back soon!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  I have eaten here several times and it is always fun to drop back in.  Great atmosphere and food.  I wish they would bring back the fried Brie, but I have enjoyed everything I have tried.  Catch them on the weekend when they have music going and it is a great place to spend some time.  Definitely soak in the feeling of the place and have some Bangers to round out the meal.  Many happy returns and thanks again to the great serving staff!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Irish bar right on Mill ave.  Ambience is good. Decoration around the bar, gives a super cozy sensation of an Irish bar (wooden floors, wall decorations)  Occasional days of the week, they also have live music. Super fun!  Guinness on draft and lot of traditional dishes. Seriously mind blown with everything I have tried so far. (For vegetarians out there, they also have meals for you)  Outside patio is very spacious plus, if want, you can smoke cigars (if you are into that).  In general, great experience with great friendly staff.  Worth the visit! Good luck! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've come here plenty of times with friends while partying on Mill Ave but I've never been in long enough to try the food. Sunday afternoon we weren't feeling the lacking brunch menu at the place next door so we figured why not try something different and wandered in to Rula Bula. We were really impressed, I had the beef medallions and my boyfriend had the pot roast sandwich. Both were so good we ended up splitting the two between each other because we couldn't pick which one was better. I want to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic and so was the company. The bartender (Daphney) was very friendly and attentive to everyone at the bar. She kept everyone happy and engaged in conversation with them all. This caused me to go back the very next day. Same thing with one exception. I watched her try for over 30 minutes to find someone to watch the bar for her to go to the bathroom. She finally did just to immediately be turned around by the GM who said, \"can't you see I'm busy\".  About 5 minutes later he came and watched the bar. She was gone 3 mins and when she returned you could tell by the body language he was being very rude to her. Once he walked away you could see he felt empowered and above her. This guy needs talked to. He needs to realize we become repeat customers due to the servers and bartenders not because of the GM who never once engaged with a customer. I would easily give 5 stars if not for this GM who obviously is out of his league managing anything."}
{"text":"Good pub food, reasonable prices, and decent service. I had the Irish Lamb Stew, and it was well cooked, tasty, and filling. Not gourmet, but for the price and the ambiance, I'll certainly go back."}
{"text":"When giving reviews I'm always hesitant to give REALLY critical remarks unless I believe my remarks can benefit the business somehow.  I see a lot of potential with this place. Being one of few locations in all of Phoenix that serves an Irish interpretation of food, there is plenty of opportunity for this restaurant to grow with their clientele.  However, before doing so, there are some stark fundamentals of how this business runs its processes that really irk me.  Simply put, there is a lack of consistency all around. You can see this by how diverse the reviews are. 5 star, 1 star, 4 star, 2 star, 5 star, 1 star, etc and so forth.  Some servers here are wonderful, attentive, assertive, and knowledgeable in the business' food menu. Some servers are just a-ok.  The host was either hungover, or simply didn't care about their job, the lack of greeting when my girlfriend and I entered the establishment was too telling, and the lack of charisma let alone eye contact with us as customers further reinforced this.   Now, onto the menu: The menu has some very solid traditional food offerings. Things like Shepard's Pie and Corned Beef and Cabbage are familiar and can be seen as the \"prime\" of the menu.  As a server though, I was not offered any menu suggestions, or given anything beyond the standard server experience.   This among other reasons is what makes this place just \"average\". It's a shame, though, given the uniqueness of some aspects in this restaurant, and they sort of just let it go to average. Which, to me, is a waste in this business. You need to have a \"wow\" factor as a restaurant, and it's so simple, we're not asking you to remodel the tables with new plywood, we're just asking for your servers to be more engaging with the customer.  When our food was delivered, we were not offered any additions, like extra napkins, or a refill on my clearly emptied water. Again, not a bad thing, but not good either. Just average.   To summarize, from a customer POV, mix of good and bad points:   FRONT OF THE HOUSE: * Entered restaurant, the host seemed disinterested and seated us at a table where an elderly person's walker was present * Server who was not our table's greeted my girlfriend and I, but host did not. I don't think I'm allowed to state names on Yelp reviews, so I'll just describe the server who was not ours as having VERY bright red hair. * Server who was not our table's was VERY friendly and gave equal attention to both girlfriend and I. This is a GREAT plus, and why I didn't give a two-star rating. The \"front of the house\" in a restaurant can make or break a restaurant going experience for your customer. * Server who WAS our table's was friendly * Our server was a bit slow to get our drinks (waited for 5+ minutes after being seated). * Our server was nice with accepting our food order * Our server checked in with us after the food was delivered. * Our server was keen on details and identified the check that my girlfriend hid from the table because my girlfriend doesn't want me to pay for the bill (lol)   THE FOOD: * My parsley garnish on my eggs benedict had grit in them. The parsley was clearly not washed before being minced. OR, the parsley was cut on a dirty board. * The temperature of the potatoes in my eggs benedict dish were not hot. It was as if someone had cooked them, and let them cool for too long. * The cabbage in my girlfriend's corned beef and cabbage dish was not cooked all the way. I am unsure if this is a restaurant preference or if the cook was just lazy and didn't want to wait for the cabbage to cook all the way.  THE BEVERAGES: * We ordered ice water, as we went for lunch and weren't feeling any alcoholic drinks.  * Water came out relatively quickly, had ice, however, I finished mine quickly and was never offered a refill   All in all, it's average right now, but there's hope for the business from a lunchtime perspective. I really hope the business owner takes this review to heart, because I mean well. I didn't want to have to give Rula Bula a 2 star review, but as Yelp states for 2 stars.... \"Meh, I've experienced better.\"  You can be a 3 star restaurant, or even a 4 star with just a little more effort in how you engage your customers and handle your food. Washing parsley takes seconds. A food warmer is  great one-time investment. Coaching your servers and rewarding them for good behavior strengthens your business all around, and more importantly, it makes your customers want to return."}
{"text":"Upon my second trip to Tempe, I had to return to the Rula Bula.  One night, I again had the shepherd's pie, and it was average--not what I raved about 6 months ago.  Maybe an off night for the chef.  Another night, however, I ordered the pork tenderloin dinner and it was fantastic!  It rivaled any dish you might get at an upscale restaurant.  Seriously.    Anyway, people come here to drink and socialize, not for a fine dining experience.  It still gets 4 stars for cool atmosphere, an open-mike night, good Guinness, and a great outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Hate it.  Horrible.  Expensive.  Terrible drinks.  Rude bartenders."}
{"text":"i'm irish. like red hair, freckles, i like lucky charms irish. this place.... isn't irish. sure, it's got Guinness signs and there's Harp on tap, but ahhhhh no. it tries. it really does. i think they had something on the menu called the 'dublin burger'. see? it's trying.  having said that and dispelling this silly rumor that this place is an irish pub, i have to say that its not terribly awful. i dug the whole two bars thing (one in the establishment and one out back on the patio). i love patios. i'm a sucker for outdoor drinking. they have heat lamps out there for when AZ is not 110 degrees. its pretty nice.  service was so so. the bartendress in the front wasn't exactly attentive and kind didn't give a crap if we wanted food or not. the waitress on the patio was great. she was on top of our drink orders and even anticipated others. pretty spiffy.  food was decent. i split the fish and chips and the irish potato nacho-y thingies. for the money, i would say it really wasn't worth it. i would probably head down to gordon biersch to get some bang for your buck in that area but the beer selection was decent and they had harp on tap. points there.   decent place to grab a beer. i also saw that they have a live band come in from time to time. dunno how great that sounds being indoors in that smallish area, but /shrug. to each his own."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. I got the wings both times. Very good sauce- I did the Rula Bula and, I believe, Guinness BBQ. The beer selection is excellent. We had our first experience with Banana Bread Beer. Amazing!  The Guinness blends are great. Staff was very friendly and attentive. I don't remember the meal i had the first time but I remember being very happy with it."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is ALWAYS fun at Rula Bula its one of my favorite places to go on mill its not filled with college Students but more of a mixture of post grad and established adults.  -The cider on tap is a must if you prefer a light beer  -When they have live music at night the vibe is beyond perfect"}
{"text":"St. Paddy's Day! Irish pub in Tempe. Decorated like the auld sod. Nice patio out back. The was starting to crank up when we left, but it wasn't Irish music music. Downtown Tempe was crazy. A spectacle."}
{"text":"I've always loved Rula Bula, but I have to tell you I went there for lunch last weekend during the Tempe Art Festival and they really out did themselves.  The place was packed, but we were warmly greeted and because we didn't mind a high-top table, we were promptly seated.  Our waitress was over the top....very friendly and attentive, as was all the wait staff.  We found out later that our waitress had 19 tables she was covering at that time, but you never would have known it.  The food was excellent, as always, the the drink was even better."}
{"text":"I visited on a Saturday afternoon for brunch and had a great time! The Mac Attack burger was HUGE and the Brussels sprouts as a side were awesome. The service was friendly and attentive and the ambience was fun and rustic. Will definitely come back next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"It's official - I have found my favorite place in Arizona for fish and chips. We came here last night with a large group for drinks before going to see a show at the Marquee Theater but my boyfriend and I snuck off to the bar area inside and ordered a bite to eat. I don't think anyone in the group really noticed we were gone. Plus, it's like 90 degrees outside so A/C sounded really nice to us...  There is a tiny TV in the corner so of course, we sat right in front of it so that my boyfriend could indulge in March Madness or whatever (He loves sports, me - not so much).  Anyway, I ordered a black velvet - it is essentially Guinness with champagne. Brian got a black-and-tan, which is Guinness and harp. I felt like we were preparing for St. Patty's Day (which is today!). I enjoyed my black velvet and would order it again because I personally enjoy Guinness and champagne separately. I also used to work at a Tilted Kilt when I was in college so I would always have a snakebite and a shot after my shifts - loved my Guinness beverages.  The fish and chips were perfect! The cod was battered with the right amount of seasoning and instead of french fries, the dish is served with potato slices. Brian really enjoyed the potato slices but we wished they were a little more crispy. I wish I could give you a better description about the food but that was all we ordered. Because of the sweet tooth I have, I was eyeing up the bread pudding but we decided to leave our seats at the bar and join the rest of our group on the outside patio bar area. So I didn't get it but we will next time! Ugh, if it weren't St. Paddy's Day, we'd go tonight but I'd rather skip the bustle."}
{"text":"It almost feels like someone took a step back and said to themselves, \" It's about time we sprinkle a little class on this party street.\"  In all honesty, I party as much as the next alcoholic cheap beer craving college student, but its still nice for my liver to take a break from the onslaught of cheap Que Club Long Islands and Thursday Barneys Boathouse shenanigans.   With that being said, big ups to Rula Bula for establishing a relaxing, authentic Irish Pub ambience while still serving some hard to find Irish Brews and delicious Irish bar food. Huge fan of the outside-patio set up; it offers enough room for large crowds to get their drink on while still providing a somewhat intimate feel for smaller parties looking for a more laid back night out.   As for the food and drinks; highhhhly suggest going with a frothy pint of Murphy's Stout, followed by a Shepard's Pie that'll leave you feeling as if you're eating in Dublin. Happy Hours are usually pretty solid as well."}
{"text":"This is one of the few places I can go, sit at the bar, & order a nice dinner & maybe a Blue Moon and feel \"among my people.\" Also...I can bring my 80something parents and 50something siblings here on St Pat's Day (granted- DAY, not night) and they fully enjoy it. Finally...this is where I learned that my culture has FOOD! Yes- the Irish have a culinary heritage. Who knew. At Rula it looks like: salmon, boxty, bread pudding ice cream, shepherd's pie. Don't let the bar appetizers keep you from ordering 1 or 2 great entrees...."}
{"text":"There's a lot we like about Rula Bula. Hubby adores the Boxty selections, and even gets a little miffed when other Irish places do not serve them. Last time we went, we decided to try items we had not had before, so we opted to share the Fisherman's Platter (with 4 shrimp, 2 pieces of fish, and 1 scallop and chips) and the Irish Mac & Cheese with Rashers (bacon pieces). The Mac was not as stellar as I hoped, but that didn't stop us from finishing the dish. It needed a bit more seasoning, I think. The Platter was good, but the standout for us both was the chips- 1/4 inch slabs of potato cooked to perfection and sprinkled with salt and pepper. The coleslaw was also the way I like it-crispy, and not too sweet. The meal also came with two types of Irish soda bread and a side salad, which made a very nice lunch the next day, as we were completely stuffed from the dishes we shared. Service was attentive, and the prices are fair. We'll be back for the boxty, for sure."}
{"text":"Rula Bula saved my marriage!  Rula Bula also holds the secrets of the Free Masons, is a regular meeting place for the Illuminati, and the Knights Templar once excavated its basement with the goal of finding the Holy Grail.  Okay, now that I have your attention, I can honestly say that only one of those things are true.    The fact of the matter is that I have put off writing a review of Rula Bula for over a year because I have always found it difficult to articulate why I love this place so much.  Anyway, I could put it off no longer, so here it goes:  Many years ago, when I came of drinking age, Rula was one of the first pubs I went to and it has always held a special place in my heart.  Now, do not get me wrong, the reasons that I hold RB in such high regard are not all based upon sentimental nostalgia.  Let us start with the menu.  I am a vegetarian and Rula has always been a safe refuge for me; the vegetarian shepherds pie is phenomenal and their veggie burger is always a safe bet.  Rula also has my favorite dessert in the Valley of the Sun; the Irish Bread Pudding with Vanilla Ice Cream is responsible for an extra five pounds I carry around these days.  Moving on, the ambience of this Irish pub located in the desert is relaxation incarnate.  Okay, let the debate end right here, right now--although Rula Bula's bar and woodwork were constructed in Ireland and shipped to Tempe, this does not make it an authentic Irish pub, and someone arguing either side of that coin is a moron.  Nowhere in the bar, on their menu, or on their website do the owners claim that Rula is an \"authentic\" Irish pub.  RB is 7500 miles from Ireland, so no, it is not going to be exactly like the homeland.  Also, I do not seem to read a lot of reviews of people complaining that Pizzeria Bianco's food and ambience is not authentic, the way it is in Naples; get over it, people.  Beer!  I love that I can get all of my favorite Irish and English beers on tap here.  Live music!  I love their open mic night and basically all the other nights during the week when they have great bands playing.  One last point, they have a great staff of bartenders and servers.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Not sure who would give them anything less than 5 stars. Every time I go Rula Bula, I leave more amazed with Irish cuisine. Everything on the menu I have tried was perfect and if I could, I would eat here every night.  Thanks for introducing me Irish brown bread!"}
{"text":"Since everyday is a good day for a Guinness, and since I happen to be on Mill every single day, this is the spot I like to come to collaborate those 2 facts of life. I also really love that I get free drinks, often, but I think its just the red hair. Seriously, red heads in Irish pubs.. I could tell stories for days..  Its not exactly your model Irish pub, but they have a decent happy hour, yummy menu options, lots of space and a sweet patio with an outdoor bar. The only real downfall here is the douchey dudes that are always here and that it is always retardedly packed after 8pm. Otherwise, its all good. Seriously subtract that and add a mechanical Bull or something equally obnoxious, and I'm a fan for life."}
{"text":"actually really like this place, but rarely come here. probably cause it's on the Mill \"strip\" and just about everything else there is not like this place at all.  this is a fairly large pub complete with brass accented bar and hardwood floors. the food is super English/Irish with Shepard's Pie and other \"meat and potatoes\" fare. not cheap, but it's unique and good, so it's worth it.  there is live music every weekend, and possibly during the week, too. i think weekends after 10 they start charging a cover, but it's only like $3. it can get really loud inside, especially with the live music, but thankfully, there's a huge outdoor courtyard area with a bar, which is where i spend my time there.  the crowd can be college, but not obnoxious college, it's a laid back crowd of students and older folk, too. the place can get pretty busy during the semester, and sometimes the wait at the bar is frustrating.  all in all, it's a cool place, especially among all the other trashy, club-like places that abound in that area. i only knock off a star for the terrible indoor acoustics and bar service during peak hours, which can't really be helped anyway."}
{"text":"First off, let me say that Rula Bula is one of my favorite pubs to just chill and get a great cocktail. They also introduced me to one of my favorite snack-and-drink combos: the Irish chips with curry dipping sauce and a glass of Irish Mule (or maybe two ;) )   So why am I giving them a barely 3-star review right now? It's sad to say but last night, I realized as good as their curry sauce and Irish Mule are; they are probably the only two things I'll ever order from Rula Bula.   The Irish dip I ordered last night was mediocre. Since I know the Irish chips are thicker than regular chips, I specifically asked for mine to be extra crispy and they came out even soggier than normal :(   Service: I has received good service here from most of my visits before. However, my server last night was not very attentive. She took a really long time to notice that we were ready to order our food. Once received our orders, she took another while to come by and check on us. So I never even bother to ask for a side of ranch that I originally wanted.   Overall, this review is specifically for my experience from last night. I am sure Rula Bula can and will do better than this."}
{"text":"One of the few places in town with Ace Pear Cider on tap...good job. the outdoor patio is nice and the old Irish feel of the indoor bar is always a plus. Some of the best fish and chips in the area."}
{"text":"I've always loved Rula Bula. It's a great, laid-back atmosphere. They've got a great variety of Irish whiskeys, as well as some perfect Irish boxty, a potato pancake. It's quirt hard to find any boxty in AZ, much less something so good as this. The braised (in Guinness) beef boxty is savory, tender and wrapped in that fluffy pancake. NOT a breakfast food, at all."}
{"text":"Rula Bula has great food, good atmosphere and is located in a fun area. The outside patio area is also a fun place to kick back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a fun place to grab a Guinness and a Shepherds Pie!! (which, by the way, is awesome!) They have a good menu with enough choices to satisfy most appetites. They offer a great patio space providing room for small groups up to large groups parties.  They host a fantastically fun St. Patrick's Day party including singers and traditional Irish dance troops.  Iv'e experienced this event several times with no fail of a great time!!! The staff has always been accommodating and friendly. Parking is provided in the lot on the north side of the restaurant along with a free parking code for up to 2 hours.  The atmosphere inside is warm, cozy, and clean.  I like all the wood and stained glass decor and the bar is a great one to 'belly' up to. If you're looking for a comfortable place that serves great Irish food, give it a try.  The chef is typically open for special requests as I have made a few without any attitude or hassle. Give this place a try.  And yes, there is a Happy Hour....perfect if you have a fun group of friends in need of a Friday night fix! :)"}
{"text":"Rula Bula is a cool irish pub located on Mill Ave. They did have an outside area, but it  was very busy so we where sitted inside. The food was really good. I loved the appetizer sampler that I ordered.   There was a live band on night we where in there. Very hard to talk to anyone. So FYI not a good date place after certain hours as you can hear each other."}
{"text":"When Rula Bula opened I was pretty excited because I like things like Guiness and shepard's pie.  Both of these things are decent at Rula Bula and given the other choices along Mill Ave, this place looks like a foodie's wet dream.  The thing I like the most about Rula Bula is the wooden fixtures and the decor.  Oh, how I do not miss hanging out in Tempe, but if I had to go back, I'd stop by Rula Bula.."}
{"text":"Lots of fun - great deck in the AZ Spring temps, and a great location on Mill Ave.  The service is a bit slow if you want a server, but if you get your own drinks then not bad.  Also, a bit pricy."}
{"text":"I ordered the French Onion soup and the fish-n-chips. Both were very good. Atmosphere was good, except I was there on a Friday, and halfway through my meal a rock/party band started playing. Decent band, but killed the atmosphere to be having fish and chips and Guinness while a band is whaling away on an Eagles tune. Instantly transformed from an Irish pub to every other party bar on the street. Even before the band they had alternative music playing on the sound system. 5 stars for food, but minus 2 for atmosphere and lack of a theme commitment."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Rula Bula. My boyfriend had been previously and spoke very highly of it. So during an evening stroll on Mill Avenue, we decided it would make a great spot for dinner.  I had the shepherds pie and he had the bangers and mash... Both were exceptional. The menu noted that the shepherds pie had been voted \"best of Phoenix\", and I quickly realize why. The dish was savory and flavorful, comfort food at its finest!  Despite becoming full only a third of the way through my meal, I pressed on! I told myself that each bite would be my last until there was nothing left on my plate.  I'm not sure what wizardry was used to create this meal, but I feel it might be black magic & I'm totally okay with that.  If I could give them 6 stars, I would."}
{"text":"I like this place if I want to go out and grab drink. The nightlife atmosphere there is chill and not crazy like the other bars. They serve good cider."}
{"text":"Gone downhill. The corn beef from Safeway is much better. Super thin sliced here, robbery, potatoes and carrots half cooked. Try four peaks to see the difference"}
{"text":"Best Margarita's at an Irish Pub??  Yes Yes and YES!  They were super refreshing that the first one quickly tasted like another.  There were 4 in our party and 3 of us ordered salads, one friend opted for the brunch menu and got the omelet of which she said was delish!.  I had the Irish Cobb Salad with their house made garlic herb vinaigrette.  Best Cobb salad I have ever had!  So fresh and the chicken was cooked perfectly.  There is a tendency to overcook it on a salad.  Service was on par and very friendly!  Will definitely be back on my next visit to the area!  Oh, and there was live music too.  Put that together with the beautiful afternoon and all was picture perfect. Good job!!"}
{"text":"Rula Bula was really really fun.   The outside patio was SUPER packed...I was pushing people out of the way just to walk inside. The inside was empty...must have just been that kind of night. The band playing inside was really great, they played some old Journey and such. We left as soon as people started fighting on the patio...  Go here for a rowdy time!"}
{"text":"I am going to give this place only 3 stars because 1, I have a 95% chance of getting kicked out whenever I go here, lol.  It always seems to be the case and 2, the food is ok, nothing spectacular.  With that being said it actually is a really cool bar.  It has a psuedo authenticity to it that makes you feel like you're in Ireland they have great live Irish music.  That is always a positive.  I find the beer selection to be pretty good and the vibe to be pretty good as well.  Although not the best Irish bar I have ever been to (I am from Boston) it's definitely the best Irish bar I have been to in Arizona, and one of my top 2 spots on Mill Ave."}
{"text":"Great service + great food + great beer = five stars. The bartender Camille knows her beers.  Fish and chips are excellent (as they advertised)."}
{"text":"I came here because it is a location in a book series that I love and I got super excited once I found it was a real place.  As someone who has spent a lot of time in Ireland, I'm pretty picky when it comes to Irish food. And I have very little patience for Americanized Irish food.  First impressions: * Downtown Tempe is super cool * The decor is legit inside of Rula Bula * The staff are super nice, especially the bartender who helped us (tall white male, tattoos, plugs - didn't catch his name) * They have Magners on draft! Which I've never seen in the US  Unfortunately the food wasn't that great. I got the steak and guinness pie and it was a bit bland. The portion was generous and all meat but it needed more Guinness and more salt. The sides were very good.  My Mom got Fish and Chips and she wasn't that impressed either. The pieces were small and also bland.  BUT on a happy note, my friend got the Mussels and really enjoyed them.  I would absolutely go back, they have cool stuff happening every night. And the bartender was super cool. But I don't know that I would eat here again. Probably just drink. The food prices just aren't justified.  (That said, I do want to go back for breakfast and see how their Full Irish Breakfast is)"}
{"text":"We had cobb salad and corned beef and cabbage. Everything was great. Our server got our granddaughters balloon off the ceiling twice. Great atmosphere. We'll be back."}
{"text":"A little over 5 years ago Mr. M came to me and said, \"Do you hate winter?  I hate winter\".  I said, \"I've always hated winter\".  And then we started plans to move to Arizona.  I had been here many times over the years, but he had never been to the desert.  So you know me with my wily ways, I planned a fantastic scouting trip in the middle of March and we left St. Louis crappy winter/early spring weather to spend 4 days here in the Phoenix metro area.  One of the things we did was visit Rula Bula around St. Paddy's day and had great food, even better drinks, and got to see the Keltic Cowboys play. That was one of the rare nights in the past 10 years where I stayed up until 2 a.m.!!  What a great time.  Ever since then we've been back maybe 2 dozen times over the years and always have a great time.  For us we really enjoy getting some exercise around Tempe Town Lake and then rolling in here around 2 in the afternoon.  It's usually quiet and we can gab with the bartender and have a relaxing time.    On our most recent visit, about 2 weeks before Christmas, we stopped in on a Sunday completely unaware that they have a weekend brunch menu.  I had the traditional benedict plus avocado and really enjoyed that one.  I loved the fact that they put it on puff pastry instead of a heavier bread item.  I usually have to take half home, but this time I ate it all by myself and only let Mr. M have one teeny bite.    The Black Velvet cocktail on the menu sounded interesting and it was.  Champagne with some Guinness floating on top.  Pretty to look at and even better to drink.  We now have some Guinness and cheap champagne in the fridge to make one of those whenever we want.  Mr. M had his usual Guinness BBQ wings and some Jameson on the rocks.  No complaints there.  Jody took great care of us at the bar.  All in with the food and drinks it was $32.90 before tax and tip.  We always look forward to a visit to Rula Bula."}
{"text":"I have been here at least half a dozen time (only four \"check-ins\").  Never had a bad meal or bad service.  For the delicious photo associated with this post is Bangers & Mash.  The meal came with glazed carrots. The mashed potatoes were very good. The carrots were good, too. The sausages were fair. They tasted a lot like some breakfast sausage I have had. They were nothing to write home about. Honestly, they were a bit disappointing. The one outstanding thing was the gravy. I've had sex that was less enjoyable.  It was great!  If they sold it on its own, I'd buy a gallon and a straw.  (Update on 06/13/16: Ordered the Bangers & Mash again only to be disappointed.  The once \"nectar of the gods\" has been reduced to a thin excuse for gravy where the beef component is beneath an amorphous layer of grease.  This was once a great dish.  Add to this experience poor service from my waitress - she nearly didn't exist; I saw here ten minutes after I sat down and again 40min later for my bill.  There was also an obnoxious aroma of fish in the restaurant.  Not the smell of cooking fish but the smell of a boat deck.  I have lowered the rating to three stars.)  I have also had the Fish & Chips, and my son has had the burger.  All were good.  The outdoor seat is nice when it isn't \"hell-fire\" hot in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I really like lunch at this place and think they have some great values on their menu.  I often get the lamb stew and along with the soda bread it ends up being more than I can eat.  I've always eaten up at the bar and the same bartender has been there to serve me over several years and he always goes above and beyond service expectations (I really appreciate that he always wants to know if I like my food after the first bite and always asks if I want a go cup for my drink as I'm paying).  Definitely a great place for lunch and at night they often have live music which rotates between inside and the patio based on the weather.  This is certainly one of my favorite spots in Tempe."}
{"text":"Irish Pubs.  I probably don't give them a second thought for about 363 days out of the year.  Granted that's likely in part because I don't have any trace of Irish ancestry that I can discern, but that's also partly because (1) I'm not a heavy drinker and (2) traditional Irish food has always been kinda meh to me.  That said, you can certainly count me as one of the multitudes of people who've passed through Rula Bula's doors at least once.  Before tonight's lovely International Supper Club UYE event (special thanks to Monica O for organizing it), my last stop at Rula Bula was at about 5 years ago on a sweltering August Saturday night amongst hoards of ASU students (long story).  This time, a weeknight dinner under the stars with ASU students thankfully on Spring Break.  It's been a while since I've tried Rula Bula's menu, so tonight it was time to rediscover one of the valley's longest standing Irish establishments.  Set in one of Tempe's oldest buildings (the more than century old Andre Building on Mill Avenue), Rula Bula has been a fixture for locals, tourists, and ASU students for decades.  The name Rula Bula translates to \"uproar and commotion\" in Irish Gaelic and the name fits the product quite accurately.  The interior has the feel of a quintessential old world pub with a relatively limited amount of seating and a small corner used for live music alongside the obligatory bar.  The patio out back has a bar of its own with some extra seating (though they often remove some of the tables and chairs from the patio to pack in more patrons during super busy nights).  You could be perfectly comfortable here during happy hour or during dinner hours most nights.  On weekend nights, however, the place will get raucous with big crowds and live music to boot.  I've had the corned beef and cabbage as well as the bangers and mash here before.  Tonight it was time to go outside the box.  Or perhaps I should say inside the box.  Okay forget that word salad, I ordered the Boxty.  Never heard of it?  Neither had I until I read the menu.  Basically a potato crepe stuffed with braised beef cooked down in...well Guinness of course.  Also got a side of Rula Bula fries (basically shoestring fries with a little extra spice).  To wash it all down, I went with a Guinness Blonde (not a fan of the old school Guinness so this was the compromise).  Total cost for the food, drink, tax and tip came to about $27.  For the record the Guinness Blonde was fine.  Harp remains my favorite Irish brew, but Guinness Blonde is a perfectly passable and relatively light lager.  The boxty was a fairly decent portion and the braised beef was excellent.  The beer flavor was evident, but complimented the meat juices rather than overpowered it.  The crepe itself was something of an afterthought which was surprising since supposedly the traditional boxty is really all about the potatoes.  The fries were a pretty good pairing and soaked up the meat juices pretty well, though I'd probably go with the whipped potatoes as a pairing the next go around.  As with other trips I've had to Rula Bula I would pretty much rate the overall experience as okay.  Not great, not terrible, just okay.  The food was okay, the service was on the slow (but friendly) side, and the prices might be just a tad steep both for the food and beverage.  I suppose your outlook on Rula Bula and Irish Pubs in general probably just depend on your expectations.  If you're here to ham it up with your friends or the other patrons with a beer in hand, then you'll probably feel right at home.  If you're looking for a solid sit down restaurant experience, you might be disappointed on some fronts.  If you're looking for a St. Patrick's Day option, I will say from experience that Rula Bula is a fun place to be on St Patty's Day with great music and great vibes.  I may not frequent Irish Pubs often, but I can confidently say that Rula Bula is up there with the best you'll find in the valley."}
{"text":"Pre-game dinner before the ASU vs Stanford baseball game at the Muni. They serve Fish & Chips the way it was meant to be. Guiness is smooth, cold & creamy. TREMENDOUS !!"}
{"text":"Rula Bula means something along the lines of a 'fun party,' and this Irish pub didn't disappoint!  A friend and I came here after she'd heard great things about it, and I'm glad we did - Rula Bula is definitely different from the typical Mill Ave bar scene, with a slightly older crowd.  They have a good selection of beers and ciders on tap, including Magners (they have bottled pear, and apple on tap), which I hadn't had since studying abroad years ago!  They have lots of seating, both indoor and outdoor, which makes for an easy time finding a table.. just be aware that the patio is smoking-friendly though, so if you're sensitive to second-hand smoke, it might be better to sit inside.  Our server was also very friendly, and checked in with us regularly to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.    I only ordered cider while there, but my friend also got their shepherd's pie, due to the positive reviews.  Before we'd met up, she'd mentioned craving mashed potatoes, which was a good thing I guess, because the dish appeared to be about 75% potato, 25% everything else.. it was also only lukewarm when she got it, but our server was kind enough to heat it a bit more.    Overall, in terms of atmosphere and service I'd give Rula Bula a 5/5, but I took off 1 star because of my friend's dinner. If you're looking for an Irish pub, and want a different experience from the typical Mill scene, I'd recommend trying out Rula Bula :)"}
{"text":"Of course this place makes its name as a pub, but I'll review it as a restaurant.  I stopped in here for lunch last week, as Irish food sounded like a nice change of pace from the usual.  The lunch menu had several appealing options.    I had the Shepherd's Pie (with Cheese).  I will say, it tasted great.  I've always been a fan of Shepherd's Pie, and this didn't disappoint.  My colleague had the fish and chips, which looked tasty as well.  The only complaint I had was that the portions are a bit small.  I know it probably wouldn't be healthy, but I probably could've eaten two of those pies."}
{"text":"Visiting Tempe and was just walking off dinner and decided to stop in for a beer.  Wound up smoking a good cigar and having a few pints.  Very friendly staff"}
{"text":"Came in on St.Patrick's Day after the Flogging Molly concert and smooth jazz music is on??!! Big. Fat. Fail. We had to ask them to put it on something different (How about some irish drinking music, it's St Patty's Day for pete's sake!) and it took the manager/bartender forever to get around to it. It looks like it was just somebody's ipad plugged into the system playing Pandora. On a side note, our female bartender was flipping awesome and knew a LOT of scotches."}
{"text":"Had a great time with my wife and daughter.  Friendly pub environment, great staff, good food and a decent beer selection.  Lots of cool nick backs to look at, old saddles, swords on the wall, Pat Tillman memorabilia, etc.  ate at the bar and that was fun.  The overall experience is a 5."}
{"text":"Service is pretty good and food is incredible!  I would bump this up to five stars if service was a little faster.  That being said, the food and booze alone are worth the hype.  Their entire traditional menu is on point.  Shepard's pie is MASSIVE and the meat is juicy and perfectly flavored. Happy hour is a must do because their prices are unheard of for anything I've experienced on mill ave.  The Black and Tans are almost perfectly poured.  They cater to the ASU crowd which makes the energy/atmosphere lively and exciting. If you want delicious Irish pub food I wouldn't suggest anything else!"}
{"text":"By far the best Irish Pub in the area!  The food is delicious, standard Irish fare.  Great whiskey selection, and the expected Irish beer selection as well.  PLUS- Every Friday night, The Paper Snowmen play, and they rock."}
{"text":"I just moved here and wanted to go check out the local Irish pub. Well Rula Bula did just that! A classic Irish pub with all the right beers and a fantastic choice of whiskys. Good food, nice bartenders and Irish music to go along with it. Try it out. Slainta!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of the 'new' Mill Ave but life is about change... I had never been to Rula Bula before but checked it out with a friend. I honestly can't remember what my friend ordered and I apologize for that. I had the award winning fish & chips. I totally get the award thing, this dish was absolutely perfect! I have no idea how to fry fish and potato slices and have them come out not at all greasy- not a bit! Maybe they bake 'em, don't know... The batter on the fish was light, correct amount and light golden brown. The fish was flaky, perfectly cooked and outstanding! The chips were potato slices also delectable. There were no random potato ends, just perfect slices. I opted out of vinegar, instead I got a side of house tartar sauce. It too was excellent. There was a trivia contest going on but it wasn't distracting. While the front matches the rest of Mill Ave brick-a-brac the inside had the look of early/middle 19th Century. The patio looked gorgeous and the staff were attentive, polite and friendly. I'm headed back soon"}
{"text":"My friends and I went on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant was warm inside which made it quiet uncomfortable. The drinks we ordered were the Pear cider, banana fosters mixed drink and Guinness. The drink were all great. The food however was not that enjoyable. We had the Rula Bula wings and a potato ball thing. They were both less than desirable so we did not order anything else. Great place for drinks!"}
{"text":"I am part of an organization called Stupid Cancer that helps raise awareness for young adults with cancer and everything they have to go through. Well I decided to have a meetup for other young adults and their caregivers at Rula Bula! I had been there plenty of times before as I live nearby however, on the night I had my meetup, all the staff were exquisitely helpful. We were served in a timely manner, our food was delicious, we were given ample space for everyone that attended, and the best part is when we were given a challenge to take a picture with 15 strangers to help raise awareness, the staff was only too willing to help! Love Rula Bula and I will stay a very loyal customer for a long time to come!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Been here several times and it never disappoints. First time i came here my bf and i just moved to tempe from sun city west. We really like Irish pubs and this one is the only one that i know that serves Magners cider.  The food is also good too. I ordered shrimp wrapped in bacon as an appetizer and it was amazing. The shrimp were large and the bacon was thick.  The servers and bartenders are friendly too. I've never had an unfriendly bartender or a server. One my favorite places to eat on mill."}
{"text":"Came out for lunch and looks as though the fried fish were their signature dishes or the typical bar food.  They have Guinness on tap, enough said!  They have a huge patio at the back and full bar."}
{"text":"Very close to the Irish experience. Some of the staff and musicians have that Irish flare. Food was authentic and very good. The menu offers most of well known Irish culinary fare. Prices very affordable. Had the Bangers and Mash, tasty and more than enough to fill. This is the place for Bloody Mary's.  One the best I've had. Worth the stop when in the Tempe area."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner and drinks last night with some friends and had a great time!  The food was surprisingly good, great service, great atmosphere...and the band was AMAZING!  I could listen to them every weekend, they were so good!  The shepard's pie, boxty and chicken sandwich were all delicious!"}
{"text":"Oh my Rula, did you redeem yourself?  It seems they might have - but I think another visit will tell for sure.  Someone sure dialed down the douchebaggery this time around, or it was an off night.  As our first official stop on our pub crawl, we met several friends there - all in all, ended up with about 20 people.  The staff was friendly, the bar tenders nice, fun and actually helpful, and the music, while not live, was at the perfect level.  Most of my group got food, and watching the locust like destruction, I'd have to guess it was all pretty good.  Their drink prices are still a little high, but at least the pours seemed to match this time around.    I'll be willing to keep going back if the service and atmosphere keeps improving like this."}
{"text":"Really nice patio. It's surrounded by vines and has plenty of misters to keep you cool even when it's 115 out. Awesome food, better drinks, and one of the waiters made a special shot for me with Jack Daniels and Goldschlagger that tastes like Christmas."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for work and pleasure and I've had a great experience every time.  Friendly servers and good food. Leave room for dessert."}
{"text":"Rula Bula is a \"must visit\" for the Mill Avenue visitor. It is a great place to just sit with friends, have a drink and talk. That is after all what an Irish pub is supposed to be. There is an excellent back patio with a satellite bar and misters. The food is typical Irish fare with everything from boxty to shepherds pie. Try the Hot Bollocks Spicy Potato Balls and wash it down with one of the hard ciders they have on tap."}
{"text":"Pricey. Cornbeef sandwiches are $10 and up. Yes, it was Irish cut cornbeef (thicker slices). The sweet potatoes were done right. The sandwich was tasty, though lacking of Swiss cheese. It would have been nicer if under $10. Washed it down with a half and half. The beer was a fair price. So bring your Celtic coin. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain"}
{"text":"Considering that all of us were roaring drunk on New Years and this pub was part of the rowdy block party in downtown Tempe, our experience was pretty smooth here. Our waiter was very friendly, made sure our drinks were refilled and that we had plenty of water, and even furnished us with silly party hats, streamers, and noisemakers. The fish and chips were tasty, made more so by the awesome tartar sauce, and the corned beef, though a little dry, was tasty too. The whole pib was assembled in Ireland, and is pretty charming and not at all pub-sized, with plentyof seating for all."}
{"text":"The first time we went it was FANTASTIC! I mean right down to the shamrock topping off my Guinness.   The second time was good but no shamrock kinda bummed about it.   The third time was a let down, no consistency and I doubt I will go back totally bummed. A real Meh experience.  I hope it gets better but tillI hear the shamrocks back I'm staying at Fibber's."}
{"text":"This is your average, run of the mill (no pun intended) Irish Pub. And it doesn't try to pretend to be anything else, nor does it need to.  The outdoor patio is especially nice, both on nice days, and even in the winter (they have epic heaters outside).   The happy hour is great, both for food and booze.  They don't have a ton of vegetarian options, so I've been using this place as more of a bar than a place for food.  However, their bread pudding is surprisingly delicious, and worth ordering. Also, in the winter, they have alcoholic hot chocolate, which is AMAZING. Really, really amazing.  Staff is nice and helpful, really fun. Wednesday night is trivia night, so they'll be packed. Be forewarned.  This is a great place to meet friends for a pint (they have cider too!) and have a good time.  Not a great place for vegetarians to eat."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  A fun atmosphere during St. Patrick's day.  Service is average at best.  The food is about average.  I previously tried the corn beef, which was bland.  I tried The fish n' chips were pretty good,  perhaps one of the best fish n' chips in the Phoenix valley."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, mixed crowd (some young and some older), decent food - live music and trivia nights. Been going for years, but it seems to be going down hill a little, or maybe I am just getting old!"}
{"text":"It was just ok, I had the Rula Bula burger which was really messy. It was hard to eat. The taste was okay, nothing special but it's a nice atmosphere. Nice for a night out. I've eaten at other Irish Pubs in Chicago and as far as food it just didn't meet my expectations but the place and service was nice."}
{"text":"Rula Bula is among my favorite bars in town, and is easily my favorite place on Mill.  They have a great atmosphere with awesome live music, and while it can get crowded on busy nights, it's never so packed that you can't move around.  The patio is great year-round (they have heaters for when it gets \"cold\"), and they have a full bar inside and out.  The inside is gorgeous and feels classy without being pretentious.  As far as prices go, they're not the cheapest, but it's reasonable.  The best part is they have a great whisky/whiskey selection - amongst the best in Tempe (if not the best)!  I can't recommend Rula enough!"}
{"text":"was here mostly for drinks..but did end up ordering a few appetizers.  Hot bollix spicy potato balls were very thick and heavy lol but oh soooo good.  basically a deep fried mash potato ball with a kick.    Hot Bollix Spicy Potato Balls An original creation of deep fried potato, rashers (Irish  bacon), scallions and Irish cheddar cheese balls  and  Grilled Bacon Wrapped Shrimp Six shrimp and applewood smoked bacon skewers served  with Guinness BBQ dipping sauce  these shrimps were medium sized... cooked just right."}
{"text":"Pretty good place if you are looking for an Irish Pub. There are much better out there, but for Tempe it's pretty good. Prices are EXPENSIVE, and sometimes they have trouble pouring... but it is a great atmosphere and usually a chill crowd."}
{"text":"I have very mixed feelings about this place. The food is very good, great fish and chips, wings, and the \"comfort food\" is amazing! However, this place has consistently terrible service. I eat here often for the food and I can honestly say I have never once had a good service experience.   On my most recent visit we waited 5 minutes for the host to even appear at the front desk. After we were seated someone brought us waters and it was 15 minutes until we tracked down a waiter to help us.   I observed the manager walking aimlessly around the restaurant ignoring the fact he had 1 waiter working every table inside and that his host kept walking to the back patio to fraternize which at one point caused a couple to give up waiting at the front desk and leave.   This experience isn't representative of every time I've been here but it is never much better.   Bottom line: the food is consistently pretty good but the service/management needs to be overhauled. Also, lay off the blasting of Irish folk music, I understand it's an Irish restaurant but it can be quite overbearing."}
{"text":"Used to be a saddle shop in 1886.  Now an Irish pub.  Enjoyed my Fish and Chips with a pint of Guinness.  As authentic an Irish pub you will find in Phoenix, Arizona. Very friendly and efficient staff.  Love the design - I don't feel like I am in a gimmicky chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying my requirement for any place that calls itself an Irish pub is that they carry Strongbow or Harp. Most places I go have one or the other (mostley just a lot of Harp). They not only had both, but the Strongbow was on tap.*drool*  I went out to dinner here first. Then hit it up later as a bar. The food is fantastic! The old world and new world menus are a great way to make sure that everyone in your party can be happy."}
{"text":"I would probably frequent this place is I lived in Phoenix...well more likely if I was a student in Tempe.   The inside and the outside are very large so it didn't give me that 'I feel so crowded that I can't breathe, touch me and die' feeling.  Usually I don't like Irish pubs because they tend to feel like caves but this one was quite the opposite.   The bartenders were all friendly and prompt.  Everyone there seemed to be having a good time.  There was even a live band which was Irish music.  When the band wasn't playing the music they had going was all pretty decent rock stuff.   My only complaint was the immense amount of cigarette smoke.  I guess it's my own fault for sitting outside...but it seemed like everyone there was smoking all at the same time and blowing it all in my direction.  Oh and also, the bathroom was pretty small for such a big place.   Anyways...  cool place."}
{"text":"My wife and I love Rula Bula!  We enjoy the atmosphere and the food.  If you find yourself in Tempe and want to go to an Irish Pub, make your way to Rula Bula.  By the way, the corned beef sandwich is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Food was fresh and tasty. Great Irish fare. The vegetarian shepards pie with mashed potatoes was satisfying and different.  The service was a bit slow, but friendly. Very relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best pub in the valley! Great atmosphere, the whole place is decorated in a way that makes you feel like you've been transported to Ireland. The waitstaff is always welcoming and kind, and the food is always so good and hardy! My personal favorites are the Shepards pie and the Boxty. I also highly recommend the apple crumble! This is a absolute must if you love Irish food or pubs. Beware though, after 10 pm they start carding so leave those under 21 at home."}
{"text":"we decided to give this place a whirl for a few brews and food before heading to the celeberty theater for a show. we found street parking across the street.......score. we went in and took a seat just inside the door. we sat there for a few minutes before our very pleasent wait person came over she took our drink order and came back within a few minutes again. we went ahead and ordered the guiness barbque sauce wings ,fish nuggetts w/chips and for a potato overkill the skins as well all the food was very tasty . she informed us that a wait person had called in ill and that was why the service was a little slow.....not that i ask because i thought the service was just fine for as busy as it was...................we will add a 1/2 star just for that"}
{"text":"I've been to Rula Bula a few times, most recently for Happy Hour. They have some decent HH specials--discounted appetizers and drinks. The food has always been good at Rula Bula, and the service friendly. As far as atmosphere, you can't ask for anything better than an authentically imported Irish bar. Well, you could ask for an authentically imported Irish beer too...but they have you covered in that aspect as well."}
{"text":"Always good cheer, scrumptious food, and a great time. We went as a couple with friends after a show at ASU-Gammage, sitting in their beer garden. Nice brew selection plus warm winter drinks like mint hot cocoa with whipped cream. Tasty wings and outstanding hot bollix (don't ask, just order). Burgers were well above board, and Rula Bula serves some of the best steamed mussels in the Valley. Vegetarian shepherds pie was good scran. And the wait staff were funny and friendly. Theater tickets get discounts on entrees. We used to go for quiz night Wednesdays but recently it's been a destination for a consistently enjoyable special night out."}
{"text":"Before I begin, I would like to point something out to the Yelpers of Tempe, Az-  All of the Guinness in the United States is imported from Ireland.  Yes, there are other breweries outside of Ireland, but America only receives Guinness from Ireland.  So, it stands to reason, that Rula Bula would, indeed, have imported-from-Ireland Guinness. That is nothing special.   However, the two times I've been to Rula Bula, the Guinness was poured well (one server even attempted the shamrock in the head... she didn't quite succeed, but she was new and it was the effort that counts).  Also, the food it super yummy!  I can't wait to drive back to Arizona in a few weeks, just so I can have the whiskey bread pudding again! It is the stuff of dreams and nightmares... nightmares only because I'm always too full to eat it all- but it's always too delicious to stop eating it!"}
{"text":"I'm on a business trip in Tempe for 5 weeks, found this place on Yelp and gave it a shot. I'm glad I did, I've been about half a dozen times now (still have a few weeks of my trip left). I haven't had anything I didn't like, and I order something different each trip. The fish and chips are some of the best I've had in a long time. Although I eat alone and do not order alcohol (read smaller tab) I've received great service every time I've been here. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Greatest Draft Beer selection on the Mill Avenue.   Guinness Smithwick's Harp Bass Magners Four Peaks** seasonal and recurring Lagunitas And many more"}
{"text":"I admit a 1 star is a bit harsh, but I am rating the Shepherds PIe.  If you have McBar shipped over from Ireland and serve Guinness, congrats to you and the hundreds if not thousands across the country to do the same.   Doesn't make you authentic.    Now for the Shepherds Pie.  Gross.  Totally inedible, so I didn't eat it.   Btw, Sheep need a Shepherd.  Cows need a cowboy.  Shepherds pie is made with LAMB!  Either way this was gross.  The waitress was very nice and took it off the bill and I had some bacon-wrapped shrimp so I wasn't starving.  The Guinness was fine."}
{"text":"I am very picky about fish and chips, so I will say that they are OK here. The main reason to go to Rula Bula would be for the atmosphere. The back patio is great for people watching and just relaxing with friends. It does get frustrating when you just want a drink outside, but a local band happens to be playing inside so you have to pay a cover to get in. I know that's the situation with a lot of other bars, but it doesn't help that I can go to a very similar bar a quarter of a mile down and not pay a cover."}
{"text":"Hey Yelpers,  Was outvoted on coming here with my work friends for lunch. I admit not a huge fan of simple Irish food but made the best of it. Got the lunch special chicken salad wrap with potato salad.   They say everything is made from scratch and so far I can say I disagree. The wrap was good. At least the amount I got. What I mean by that is I pretty much got a whole sliced tomato in my wrap and a side of the chicken walnut mix. Pic attached. I was pretty bummed out on that. I think it's reasonable to expect a normal amount of tomato on a wrap. Seriously, these were like 1 inch thick slices in there. So when I first picked up the wrap I was really excited thinking I scored major Protein but to only be denied the wonderful goodness of chicken for a half rip tomato. Darn.   The potato salad was 4 stars and the service was decent. All in all, I left hungry and went back to the office to drown my so sorrows in animal crackers."}
{"text":"I've come to Rula Bula A LOT in my 10 years of living in arizona. I remember taking my parents here as an ASU undergrad, taking dates here as a twenty something single person, and apparently still coming back today. I've always loved the food and drinks.   But for some reason, the place has never really struck a cord enough to review but I now want to only because I absolutely loved the band that was here. The audio was perfect and they actually made the night a lot better, which is unusual for a cover band. I'm not just saying this because I got a free CD. Rula Bula consistently delivers"}
{"text":"Every time we come here the food is extremely delicious. The service here is also good. We always order the Irish potato skins for an appetizer. It comes with 5 pieces and we are a family of 3. I wish it was 6 pieces but not a big deal. They are tasty. For dinner I get the bistro filet medallions and it is absolutely amazing. The place is loud but it is a bar and we always come during dinner time. We've always been satisfied with the food and service here."}
{"text":"well, you can't give 5 stars to Irish cooking but a good solid 4 will do. my friend and I eat here often and have probably tried most of the lunch offerings. always good and always warm and served with a smile. good music, good beer, and good craic. try it St. Patrick's Day, we did and had a wonderful time. by the way, the bread pudding is to die for."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Its good for HH but the food is off a bit. Whatever, it's good atmosphere and food and drinks are decent. I would go again but I have to say when I think of HH and or drinks and food this place never comes to mind. That should tell you something I guess?"}
{"text":"I stopped by here last night for a friends going away party. (sniff sniff) Cute little place. The drinks were good (Southern Peach gets a thumbs up from me) and like everyone said, the fish and chips are YUMMO!!! I had the sweet potatoes fries with my fish and everything was scrumptious. They even had spicy ketchup, which is a rare find. Either I was hungry or it was really good because I could have licked my plate if I was allowed.  We also ordered a side of the the mac and cheese, which was just ok, only because we didn't know that it had ham in it and it made the mac and cheese taste very salty so I only had a bite or two. ( We didn't see it on the menu but we saw that someone else had ordered it hence the reason we ordered it.) I think without the ham, it would  have been pretty ok.  So with that said, great food, fabulous company, a little eye candy here and there, what more could a girl ask for?"}
{"text":"Despite the strangely low reviews we came here because one of our favorite authors writes a story where the main characters visit Rula Bula often. We were in the area and thought it would be fun to check it out. The service was great from the moment we stepped in until the moment we left. And what an awesome atmosphere. It looked like I would imagine an old Irish pub looking.   We weren't hungry but we had heard they had great bread pudding (one of my favorite desserts) so we tried that. It was awesome!!  Hope to come back here sometime to try the fish and chips!!"}
{"text":"I went here last Thursday with some alumni from my alma mater.  I have to say that the food was alright, not exceptional.  We had some fish and chips, potato skins and some other food that does not come to mind.  The atmosphere is a typical bar.  It feels like any bar, any where.  Basic beer, mixed drinks, etc.  It is strange, but this place did not have a unique feel to it.  I could have been anywhere........."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar. There is atmosphere, good food, good music, and good drinks. What else can you ask for?  The outside patio can be a great setting for a romantic lunch while the inside is home to many a happy and loud night. Cider and reggae, salad and traditional Irish grub... I still have not tried the boxty. This place has some vegetarian options, mainly salads, but those are delicious.  This is the perfect place to cure those didn't-do-well-on-my-biochem-final-blues."}
{"text":"Best Irish Pub in Tempe.  Usually has Live entertainment on the busy nights.  It is super pricey, so I would suggest pregamming it at the house or a dive before you make a night out of this place.  Happy hour is a smokin deal for food, which is excellent by the way.  Hit up the fish and chips or any of your Irish faves..."}
{"text":"Few places on Mill Ave have stayed the same since I received my horizontal Arizona ID card... Rula Bula is one of them! And, it's kept all of the same 'charm' to remind us (whether we like to or not) of all of the crazy times back in college and even the times after we graduated when acted like we were still enrolled.  Rula Bula tries to hold true to its Irish theme from everything on the menu to the band that will get you dancing a jig faster than a couple pints of Guinness. The patio is also a fun spot, but get there early to find a seat. I've always found people to be friendly and willing to share a barrel where you can rest your drinks. Don't forget to order a few Irish Car Bombs and sip on some Jameson. In fact, Rula Bula even looks like pub you might stumble upon in Dublin!  Sláinte!"}
{"text":"Great local spot!  Came in alone for dinner during a business trip. Was seated right away. Tried to decide between a couple Irish sounding entrees and picked the Gaelic Chicken. It was outstanding!  3 chicken breasts smothered in mushroom gravy on top of mashed potatoes. They offer a choice of sides so I chose brussel sprouts and apples - an interesting and delicious combo!  Now I sit here completely satisfied but awaiting a half order of Irish bread pudding to put me over the top.   And did I mention, the service was great too!  I'll be back next time I'm in Tempe"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere situated on Mill Avenue near ASU. You won't find an obnoxious co-ed crowd who can't handle their liquor. The food is a little pricier than some of the other establishments along Mill Avenue which usually keeps the bad seeds out of the way. Excellent appetizers and sandwiches. Pleasant waitstaff. Reasonable prices and generous portions. One of the best Irish pubs in the Phoenix metro area."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 shepard's pie...both were very tiny appetizer sized portions for an entrees price.  Had more peas than beef and one person ended up getting sick.    Service was decent but will definitely not be back.  Not even close to worth the price."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time eating here, and I'd definitely go back! We got 2 appetizers, potato skins & the potato balls, both amazing! I got the veggie sandwich for dinner, which was out of this world!! The only downside, was that our waiter was not exactly the greatest, definitely needed lessons in keeping the drinks full. Other than that, great place!"}
{"text":"Great location.  Decent food.  Okay alcohol selection.  It is no Fibbermagee's.  It's not what I would call authentic Irish pub, but its a fun commercial knock off.  Better than most selections on Mill Avenue."}
{"text":"My wife and I meet for lunch here at least once a week. My favorite foods are fish and chips and Irish Steak Salad. Ice tea is great too. Particularly great during the winter when you can sit out on the patio."}
{"text":"Love it there but unfortunately last Saturday was not a good experience. The bartender outside was rude and with an attitude his name if I'm correct is Ryan other than him great place for Irish car bombs!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I had been craving shepherds pie for weeks and finally found a place that makes it exactly how I like it! My friend got the bangers and mash and that was fantastic as well. My boyfriend got the Mac and cheese burger which, of course, was delicious! Plus I love their half and half beer list, too ;) and this building is beautiful inside and out. Love their patio! The only reason I don't give it five stars is because I wish the kitchen was open later, since it closes at 10."}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere, a few good beers on tap, good sliders. The waitress was kind of a snob and looked \"busy\" even though there were only like 4 other people at the bar, so that was weird."}
{"text":"This was our second stop for the night at one of my friends going away party.  There was a $2 cover since there was a band playing that night.  I'm sure the band was good...I can't really remember.  But what I did remember is the drinks being a little on the weak side.  Now, I understand that I am a professional drinker, so drinks naturally seem weak to me, but my friends said the same thing and they are light weights.   The staff was very polite, so there are no complaints about the service.  It was pretty packed, but not rowdy.  I'll probably give it another try."}
{"text":"Finally got around to satisfying my fish and chips craving and I'm very happy I came here for it. The entire atmosphere and decore of this place is awesome and comfortable. And as the fish and chips go; Flakey, golden brown, delicious fish with a side of really yummy cocktail sauce and the chips were just perfectly salty. I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I go to Rula Bula every Wednesday night for the Brainstorm Pub Quiz. My friends and I love trivia, and Rula Bula hosts one of the best in town. The questions are difficult, the teams are serious, and the food and drinks are great.  Now, the reason for a 3-star review -- we come here every week, with a reservation made, and we still have problems. Sometimes they don't have a table for us, sometimes they cancel trivia at the last minute because they don't have the proper paperwork. It just seems a bit disorganized.  I give the food and drink a thumbs up, but the service, staff and organization a thumbs down."}
{"text":"I went to Rula Bula for brunch for the first time yesterday morning. I went with a big group of friends - 14, to be exact. We made a reservation, so they knew ahead of time how many of us would be there. We also told them ahead of time that we would be requiring separate checks. They were understaffed, clearly, because our poor waitress was overwhelmed. This was definitely a problem as we began ordering food and drinks. It's irritating to call in advance and give a heads up regarding some of the more complicated aspects of our party, in hopes of making the experience easier for everyone, only for the staff to be under prepared. Obviously, it took quite a bit of time for us to get our food. When we did get it, the food was lukewarm, or in some cases cold. While I understand the desire to serve the food all at once, I would rather they have served us a little at a time. We were never given the option of choosing. At the end, separating the checks turned out to be a disaster. After our waitress separated the checks, there was one mimosa unaccounted for - she couldn't remember who ordered it - so she tacked it onto someone's check. When the person stated to the waitress that she hadn't ordered the mimosa, the waitress responded and said that someone had to pay for it and she couldn't remember who ordered it. There was no attempt to figure it out, just an assumption that adding it to another person's ticket was acceptable. IT WAS NOT. I understand that being saddled with 14 guests at one table is difficult, but charging someone for an item they didn't purchase and justifying it in that way was not ok. The only reason I gave this 3 stars is because the food was good. The French toast is incredible and I would definitely recommend it. But Rula, you gotta step up your serving game."}
{"text":"Always love the fish and chips here! Great patio and inside decor. Love the Guinness float for dessert."}
{"text":"Most authentic Irish restaurant in Arizona!  Amazing lamb stew and fish and chips!  The oysters Rockefeller were awesome, but quite small for the price!!!"}
{"text":"My daughter was treating me to lunch. Even though our family avoids the over-congested, over-hyped Mill Ave circus like the plague, we decided that Irish food is what we had a hankering for. I knew that Rula Bula had great Yelp reviews and it was close to the ASU art museum we planned on visiting. I had the Bistro Filet Medallions ($9) and my daughter had the Irish Stew ($8). Her 2 year old son had the fish and chips kids meal ($6). My daughter also had the Magners Cider. Overall the food was good, but I was a little surprised by the whiskey-peppercorn gravy on my meat and mashed potatoes. When they say whiskey, they are not kidding. This is the first time I have ever had a gravy with vapor-action!  Pros: Good food, nice Irish pub vibe, and a misted patio that would be nice if it weren't in full sun on a 105 degree day with 45% humidity.  Cons: Parking, parking, parking. There is no parking lot for this restaurant. There is a pay-$2-per-hour lot next door to the restaurant. That means that we will not be making a return visit to this establishment. The valley has way too many restaurant options to put up with being gouged for parking."}
{"text":"It was \"Ok\"  I enjoyed the French Onion soup and grilled cheese & bacon sandwich.    Have to say they should toast the top of the FO soup longer, a better crouton would not hurt and maybe let it meld a little longer.   The sandwich, the pasta was a waste.  I removed that and enjoyed the sandwich better.  Atmosphere was dated, and blah.    Maybe as a lunch spot, but I doubt I'd do a dinner here again ... sorry"}
{"text":"Brussels Sprouts never tasted so good.  The place is tops for ambiance and good Irish comfort food.  The perfect place when you want to visit Mill Ave but don't want to deal with the college debauchery."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed Rula Bula for happy hour. They have a nice patio and decent food and drink specials. The food has always been okay. After my last experience there, fish and chips will never be the same. I noticed two black specks in the malt vinegar on my plate. Upon further examination, I saw that they were dead flies. I raised the bottle of vinegar into the sunlight and noticed about 75 more of them at the bottom. I was feeling nauseous as I had already had a few bites. The waitress was sorry, offered to bring me a new order. Didn't take anything off the bill, though. Guess I should have talked to a manager."}
{"text":"Joe was effen awesome. Took good care of me and tiff. Was the kind of bartender you just feel good with. Dont get married."}
{"text":"I did like the ambiance of this place...We sat outside weather was awesome. We ordered a bottle of wine.   We had the Irish Chips with melted cheddar cheese, pico de gallo, jalapeños, sour cream and chipotle pepper sauce., it was actually very good. I've never had it with potatoes! Yumm! The Buffalo Wings were BOMB! Did I mention that the Chips were off the hook! Feed me potato's!!!!  Downside:  The waiter was way chatty...and a little irritating. Before we ordered the bottle of wine I selected a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon, it was gross. I asked him to give me another selection and he clearly stated, \"My manager won't let me take it back I need to charge you for it.\" I was in shock...I couldn't believe it so I started laughing.  At that point I told him to bring me a bottle of what my GF was drinking since it was way better and forget about the whole nasty glass of wine. It's all in the delivery of the message dude...I don't care if you charge me for it. At least go and pretend to talk to your manager then tell me you can't. Duh, It's called customer service. You know the line of work your in....Just Sayin!"}
{"text":"Your run of the mill irish bar.  They have pub foods, they have the substandard bar service you would expect when not ordering a rye on the rocks or a guiness.  The other reviewers are quite correct when they say it is a haven from the torrent of douchebaggery happening outside and at the other venues.  Then again, you are in Tempe.  What do you expect?  People don't go to ASU for academic achievement."}
{"text":"Came here for a drink with a friend and a group dinner.  So many drink options at the bar and my favorite cider was on hand.  =)  There is an outdoor patio in the back that we had reserved all to ourselves.  There is a bar out here as well so you won't be empty handed for long.  Since it was highly recommended on Yelp and by our server, I ordered the shepard's pie.  I kept thinking of the Friends episode when Rachel tried to make a trifle and made a trifle/shepards pie.  This was nothing like that and was very yummy.  Brussel sprouts were served on the side which I could have lived without.  We also ordered potato skins which went very well with my drink.  Great spot.  Great service.  I definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I'd give them five stars if the servers weren't crabby ALL of the time and the bathrooms weren't a mess. And by mess I mean the t.p. dispensers are broken, some doors don't have locks, and they smell bad.   Otherwise, the food is awesome and all of the beer offerings are, too. I've had a few of the sandwiches, and the fish are chips are my favorite--big fish, great batter.  I hate that some establishments feel like, \"we're unique and in high demand, so just deal with our shitty service and amenities.\" BUT I still come here and they know I will. Damn them."}
{"text":"Great service and love the vibe. Much more mellow then the rest of Mill Avenue. Absolutely love this place."}
{"text":"Don't tell my husband I'm giving Rula Bula 3 stars.  He thinks it deserves 4.  But he should try earning his little Elite badge and write his own review I say.  After Zoolights fell through on Saturday night (not interested in walking from a parking lot in Chandler to get there), we found ourselves on Mill, which is actually only the 2nd time I've ever been on Mill.  My husband, on the other hand, had too many months unsupervised in the Valley before I joined him, and has apparently visited many of these fine establishments, including Rula Bula.  Not being a huge fan of Irish food, or beer for that matter, I decided this would be the 1 in 100 dining experiences I let him choose.  I loved  the interior I must say.  And the menu is not so bad either.  If I could find quesadillas and hot wings in Ireland, I might just visit.  But so as to not completely humiliate my husband, I ordered a cider, rather than a margarita, and fish 'n chips.  The cider was perfect, not too sweet.  If only beer should taste this good...  The fish (cod) was perfectly cooked and the batter was flavorful.  I just wish it was a little more crispy.  Perhaps it didn't hold up to my splash of vinegar.  The chips were near perfect, except I wish the fish hadn't been plopped on top as it caused them to lose their crispiness, too.  I would be happy to come back to Rula Bula again.  They have a great patio with a bar out there as well.  But I think I'll stick to the time of year when ASU is not in session.  I have a sneaking suspicion this place is a different beast when school starts back up."}
{"text":"We really like coming here but this last time, i was not so thrilled. I like the corned beef and cabbage. I think they have changed the way they cut the corned beef, prefer them to cut it thick. We also sat outside because we decided to eat during the Tempe Art Festival. Regretted that move. Smokers sitting at the bar that was right behind my table. I am the worst kind of complainer of cigarette smoke, i quit smoking years ago and the smell just gets to me. I have the nose from hell and i kept smelling it, gag me. I Still like the atmosphere of this place and not writing it off yet, i will just chose to eat in doors and order something different.  I would however love more options for my gluten free allergy.  Sure, we'll come back."}
{"text":"Great Irish pub on Mill Ave in Tempe, close to the Light Rail stop.  Definitely worth the visit for a shot of Jameson's and a beer.  Fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"The shepherds pie, grilled cheese with Mac and cheese and the champ potatoes were very tasty. My son is still talking about the potatoes!"}
{"text":"Comfort food and relaxed surroundings. It would be a place to come in out of the cold except that it's in Phoenix. Still, the old-world charm and hearty food make it great place to get fat and happy. The location leaves you with plenty to see along Mill Ave as you walk off the Bangers and Mash."}
{"text":"Rula Bula is the place to go if you're...  1. Stuck on Mill (no offense Mill...my 21 year old former self loves you and I always know to visit you first if I want a crazy time!) 2. Looking for a bar with people drinking themselves to the point of having a good time  3. Want to participate in events like trivia night   Rula Bula is a good time. But you have to go into it expecting to walk into a bar atmosphere hiding behind a restaurant. The patio is fun and there's plenty of room to sit. The food is decent and true to Irish dining. But I really don't think people go for the food. Every time I've gone, food has been an after-thought.   Be prepared to stand and wait for a seat if you're visiting after a festival or game. Rula Bula is practically the first stop after the light rail and Tempe Town Lake so it's a hot commodity! So my advice is to stick to Rula Bula if you've had some cocktails and won't mind the pub feel!"}
{"text":"Service is so bad. Waitress keep continue to ask same things over and over again"}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times the last 10 years, and I feel the same about it every time.  It is an okay place.  The atmosphere is your typical Irish venue.  It can be lively, or it can be dull depending on the day you go.  We went before the Devils vs Cats Basketball game and I was expecting lively but it ended up being tame.  The fish and chips are decent here.  But their happy hour fare was not good.  My bloody mary was not good as well.    The patio is a great spot to chill at, and with the great weather we have been having I suggest grabbing a seat outside.    Overall its a C"}
{"text":"3 and a HALF stars  I really like the large patio in the back-definitely an older and not as rowdy in the annoying BroDawg screaming for no good-goddamn reason, but more bustling like friends come here to chill the fuck out. The way a good pub should be.  However-my dining experiences and some day experiences in the past have not been great AT ALL. I found the bartenders lacking that extra mile, esp. when there was hardly anyone in there and I was at the bar alone-in a real pub, that is an opportunity to chat a little bit. I don't mean I want to tell them my lifestory, but man...its a bit awkward! Also the veggie burger was lacking and became a mess all over my hands due to some mysterious fucking leaky ass sauce. So I couldn't recommend this place for a long while 'cause everytime I went, it left me disappointed and hollow. It was also the worst poured Guiness I had ever had, too.  BUT-the bartender out back was awesome and it is a good vibe (how hippy does that sound-damn, the west is changing me!), really spacious, huge beers at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I'm in love with the Iron Druid chronicles books so I was excited to see if their fish and chips lives up to how Atticus describes it in the book.  AMAZING.  My BF doesn't eat seafood and he wished he could ordered his own instead of having a bite of mine.  Their Hot Bollix Spicy Potato Balls are unreal.  They come with buffalo sauce."}
{"text":"Nice place to have lunch in Tempe. Had the grilled cheese with macaroni sandwich.  Excellent service from the staff and the sandwich was average in my opinion."}
{"text":"The hot bollix appetizer is phenomenal. Mashed potato, cheese and bacon rolled into balls and deep fried, then served with ranch dressing and hot sauce. It's the most American take on Irish food I've ever seen. Unfortunately, that's where the food stopped being delightful for me. The entrees were merely blah. I supposed I should have ordered the dish and chips everyone raves about, but I just wasn't in the mood. Otherwise, the decor is great and actually quite authentic. Flogging Molly over the speakers? Not bad at all.  The beer...not enough selection and they need to clean their lines, but the Guinness was better than anyone should expect from a pub in Tempe."}
{"text":"This was my third stop on my first tour of Tempe. I came here on Friday, and was pleasantly surprised by an awesome Irish band playing, a really nice atmosphere and friendly bartenders!  I pulled up to the bar and sat down, ordered a beer and struck up a nice conversation with the bartender. I told her I had just moved here and she was more than happy to share her tips on other good places to drink!   I really loved the band playing that night, the songs were all Irish-themed and people were clapping and dancing around right in front of the stage. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Update: Don't get the chicken pot pie... no flavor under that crust! Disappointed..."}
{"text":"Awesome food and awesome service!  Brandon is by and far the best bartender in Tempe."}
{"text":"Another outstanding experience at the best Irish themed bar that I know of stateside.  Fantastic menu with some unique \"gastropub\" style small plates like Brussels sprouts with apples, otherwise some familiar old school fare like burgers and fish & chips.    What makes this place great is absolutely the atmo and service which is very, very accommodating.  Offers a wonderful variety of warm drinks for cold weather cheer.  Easily the coziest place to hang on Mill."}
{"text":"this place is so fun and they have awesome hefveisen on tap...very yummy...and the bouncer outside went to alert the waiter who alerted someone else and a guy come out pretty timely to change out the propane tank when our heat lamp was burned out last week so we got to warm up and continue drinking. I always recall 2 years ago when the guy waiters  and other guy staff were dressed as german beer girls or swiss beer maids with wigs, knee socks etc..the costumes were really hilarious...and yes it was on halloween! it would be funny if they dressed like that everynite though"}
{"text":"My ex was 100% Irish and as the dutiful wife, I spent a lot of time learning the ins and outs of Irish Cooking. Well that relationship ended years ago, but my love affair with good Irish cuisine has never faded.   There are a few things on the menu that are a bit Americanized, however there are some stellar examples of this simple yet tasty food.  *As Kerstin M. says, their Boxty selections are always solid. The Beef and Guinness is wonderful, but the daily offerings are sure to please as well.  *The Bangers and Mash is a wonderful combination of their handmade Irish sausage with Ulster Champs (think lumpy mashed potatoes with green onion and herbs... one of my personal favorites).  *The Guinness and Onion Soup is fabulous. I crave this in the winter months and have actually tried substituting Guinness for Brandy when I make the stuff at home! It's a nice twist on the traditional French Onion; melty cheese dripping down over the sides of the crock. *Once I was there and they were serving traditional Colcannon which is mashed potatoes with kale or cabbage and some additional spices. I can't remember if this was around Halloween, but they had the little \"prizes\" inside and everything (thankfully the waiter warned us). But what fun!!!  Remember to get your fix of fresh Soda Bread and if you are like me, wash it all down with a couple of pints and Black and Tans!  I've actually held several work events here and as they aren't quite as busy for lunch, they are the perfect destination for something a little different (normally they don't take reservations, but I've never had a problem with calling ahead and making arrangements for my group).  Rula Bula has a few detractors, but I say to them Póg mo thóin! and sláinte as I order another round!!!"}
{"text":"I am an Irish blooded boy, so I might be slanted in my opinion. :-)  My girlfriend and I try to eat here, whenever we are in the Tempe area.  We love the food and the atmosphere.  I tend to eat either the shepherds pie (awesome) or we both each enjoy the Trinity Burger (not on the menu any longer but they will make it for you) which is made with applewood bacon, cheese, BBQ and avocado.  We love dining on the back patio, when the weather is nice, and it offers a great atmosphere and vibe.    Rula Bula is one of our favorite little spots, in Tempe, to go out for a bite and a drink.    Sláinte!!"}
{"text":"Fun outdoor patio but a lot of bees and wasps.  be careful where you sit.  It is a great location, right off of mill and next to the Tempe Mission palms.  the food is solid, potato and fried foodstuff heavy.  The drinks are good, but i warn you that it gets crowded and depending on your server, you may get hit or miss service.  It pays to carry cash as they are not fond of splitting checks.  Great people watching, you get college students, street urchins, renaissance festival types, guys in suits, couples breaking up...you name it.  fun times!  Awesome for day drinking in good weather."}
{"text":"We went here to eat, the food was good, but the service was slow and the servers were indifferent. We had a party of six and it seemed too challenging for them to put more effort in towards the people at the end of the table.   When we left, one member of our party forgot his backpack. Now anyone with a brain at the restaurant would have immediately realized how valuable this loss was and would have put real effort in to look and see if it could be located. Instead after 3 calls, asking them to specifically look where it was left, and being told it was no where to be found... he drives there to look himself, only to find it in the exact place they were asked to look.   The servers are incompetent and below average in intellect. A 2 year old or my dog could have found it. This added unnecessary stress. The one star reviews about the service at this place are accurate."}
{"text":"I don't think I'm alone when I say that every time I go to an Irish pub I'm hoping to see a leprechaun.  Or at the very least some of his Lucky Charms... The only reason Rula doesn't get a 5 is the amount of time we waited for drinks / food.  Granted, we were there on a Sunday during the Tempe Arts Festival - but that' no excuse for drinks taking 30 minutes and food taking more than 75.  We got the Irish Dip with fries & the American Sliders - both were tasty and worth ordering again.  I took a peek at the back patio, which I think would be amazing with a group of friends.  This area of Tempe has LOTS of choices, so I might not be back right away, but if I'm in the area & am craving Irish cuisine / beverages / music, I'll come back fo sho."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Irish Pubs!  Love the atmosphere and the entertainment.  The patio on a nice day is a perfect place to hangout for drinks.  The fish and chips is a must and the Shepherd's Pie is a delight and really filling too.  Snakebite? Ouch! Oh wait you meant the drink - sure thing!  Bringing out the Irish in me....what does that mean!? Don't think the Irish and Chinese ever mixed in history...or did we? (The movie Departed was a remake on a Chinese Trilogy - Infernal Affairs)  Our service was quick for a pretty crowded place, but then again it was still early.  I've been there when I couldn't even walk a step....wait that was pretty much every visit to the Rula Bula! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"After living in Tempe for 18 months and making more trips to Rula Bula than I can count on one hand, I figured it was time for an update. I'm still not wowed by the food - baked brie and the chips w/Killarney Sauce are the only two items I will order because they are both really good.   The outdoor patio is awesome. I've always had fast service and even though it does get crowded at night, I never feel super cramped. The only thing I didn't appreciate was before an ASU football game a few months ago, I wasn't allowed to order two drinks at the outdoor bar because they were both going to be for me. Apparently that wasn't allowed - lame. Indoors is still a lot of fun especially due to the live music. Bar service inside is fast for me, but that's probably because some of the bartenders recognize me from how much I frequent Rula Bula.  I'm bumping Rula Bula up to four stars because I always have a good time drinking there with my husband and friends. Plus we always meet interesting people and have fun stories when we leave. Go for the drinking and music, not for the food."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I am 24 with a CA ID. This place made me feel terrible for being 24. My family was able to have drinks; however, they made me leave the bar after suspicions of me drinking alcohol, when I am 24 with a CA ID. The person who told us to leave was very rude, as evidence by him making faces and blowing \"kisses\" at our party. Strange and disrespectful behavior. Wish this was a good experience as I have never had to leave a bad YELP review. I hope the people who work at this bar on Monday evenings will become more respectful and thoughtful in how they address their clients."}
{"text":"Okay it gets a star for the patio but that's about it.  The food is just ok.  The main reason I don't like this place though is due to my first experience here.  I was at a bachelorette party and I am not a big drinker so I only had a beer.  I watched as the waiter \"bought\" a round of shots of the girls.  They each had a mixed drink or two and they WAY overcharged the girls assuming they were too drunk to remember.  This has happened at another bachelorette party I went to as well. Maybe this is just an Arizona thing?  Every time the waiter \"buys\" rounds of shots and then charges the table.  Not to mention that the mixed drinks here are REALLY expensive.   If you are into the Mill crowd and you want a party I suppose this place works, but be aware of your drinks and make sure you are charged correctly.  Do not just \"open a tab\" here."}
{"text":"It's the best Irish bar in Phoenix metro and certainly holds its own against Casey Moore's or the Bikini Lounge.  Rula Bula is large and well lit, with a large patio out back.  There's as many varieties of Irish beer as one can drink.  The real key to Rula Bula is the nooks.  Something that few bars have managed to do right in this town is nooks.  My favorite spot is just inside the front door, off to your right as you walk in.  I've spent many a night huddled with too many friends around the tiny table there.    There's a large stage that generally features good Celtic bands of one stripe or another.  Pints average five bucks a piece which is respectable enough for Mill Ave.    Rula Bula, without a doubt is the bar that reminds me most of my time in Galway with a happy, open atmosphere, plenty of room for chatting up strangers and nooks aplenty."}
{"text":"Granted this place is probably known for their beer and not their food, but really, how hard is it to supply some decent food?  I tried two appetizers - both were not good and both overpriced. I'm not a huge fan of greasy fried food so can't speak for their fish and chips.  In terms of service, one waiter was really nice but we were passed around to different waiters and I can't say that the others were helpful at all.  My recommendation would be - don't eat here."}
{"text":"Excellent . Had the fish and chips but sub'd house champ for fries.  Very good  Food is really good and the outdoor area is fun"}
{"text":"This place is awesome great prices great place to go for a giant out nice outside patio for smokers great food good drinks great staff"}
{"text":"This place has solid fish & chips and shepards pie.  Prices are reasonable and servings are generous.  We enjoyed the brussel sprouts with apples side dish too!  Casual ambiance. Our food came out quick and our server was attentive without being overbearing.   Will definitely come back here next time I'm visiting the area! I hear they have fun trivia nights!"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times before while visiting family in Arizona.  First off, let me just say the Rueben Sandwich is AWESOME.  This is what sold us on Rula Bula the first time we came here.  The 2nd time we went, we had a Rueben...and guess what the 3rd time we went, another Rueben!  Can't get enough of them I guess.   We decided that this would be a nice place for our family to go after my Dad's memorial service.  Called a few days ahead and spoke with the manager, explained the occasion and what we were looking for- somewhere that we could sit outside for a few hours, have a meal and some drinks, enjoy the beautiful weather and hang out for a while reminiscing with family.  It was indeed all that!   Our server was very good- the food was excellent (yes, we had a Rueben!)...and we also decided to split an order of fish and chips, also, very good.  We ended up hanging out for about 2 1/2 hours.  They never rushed us to get out and they even separated the checks between all the different groups of family.  Most places put up a stink if asked to make separate checks, however, Rula Bula did not.  They were very accommodating and friendly. Did I mention that they also have Guinness 250 on tap here?  Another plus! The only qualms I had about our visit is that I was a little disappointed how the tables were set up for our party.  They were split into 2 tables, and it would have been nice to have them grouped into one large table.  Instead we all just kept shifting seats in order to visit with different members of the family...no biggie I guess.   I would recommend this place to anyone looking to have a great meal, a good drink, in a laid-back atmosphere.  I'll definably come here again, next time, for Rueben #4!!! :)"}
{"text":"Can't beat their chips (fries)  and their burgers are great too. My roommate loves their grilled mac n cheese sandwich and they have great  baked potato. I love to take my family and out of town friends to experience not only the previously mentioned food but also their authentic Irish cuisine."}
{"text":"My favorite bar in Tempe.  You can never go wrong here.  Have the fish and chips to eat.  Have many servings of delicious Smithwick's.  Have Jameson.  Lots and lots of fun even when it's a bit crowded on the weekend.  Just show up a bit earlier on Friday and Saturday."}
{"text":"Stop #1 for the Light Rail Pub Crawl was Rula Bula... at least for me - and it was my first time there!  I was with my mother-in-law-to-be (Joan M), and upon making our way to the back patio, we were welcomed by a huge group of yelpers.  Great back patio by the way.  I had a Stella and Joan an Irish coffee...  Kate was our server and handled our group well - she did a good job considering so many peeps arriving at different times and paying separately.  Only one discrepancy that I overheard but it wasn't too big a deal...  The bathroom was pretty filthy and the TP was out in one stall while the door wouldn't shut on another - not a fan of nasty bathrooms in restaurants.  Enjoyable pub atmosphere and convenient location on Mill Ave just off the Light Rail.  Although we didn't eat during our visit, I was impressed with the selection on the menu and based on the positive reviews that came before mine, I would totally be open to returning to eat sometime.  I'll update then!"}
{"text":"Ahh yes your traditional Irish Pub! This is the first bar were I had the pleasure of experiencing the Oatmeal Cookie Cocktail (which they do very well by the way). Most of the Mill Ave. crowd know Rula Bula as a great bar but many forget about it as a lunch or dinner option.   They do a great lunch menu with sandwiches, Shepard's Pie ect. I usually get their French Dip with their house made fries which is almost too much food. Their fries are wonderful, basically sliced potatoes fried until they are golden brown. However, I have friends that swear the Shepard's Pie is the best thing on the menu.   The service can be a little slow as they often get hit with the convention crowd from the Tempe Mission Palms next door. However, it's affordable and just good home-style food."}
{"text":"As far as Irish pubs go, Rula Bula is spot on for me. It doesn't feel cheap and sticky like other so-called Irish pubs around here and I've never felt it was a bad choice. Drinks and a night out, mid-day for lunch, mid-week for dinner, trivia, live music... yes!   I truly love the fish & chips, but I've also enjoyed their burgers, Dublin chicken & Farmhouse chicken sandwiches, Shepherd's pie, chicken pot pie, St. Peter's Fish & the Gaelic-style chicken breast which is my go-to. The food is substantial and delicious.   I always walk out thinking I need to go back asap. :-)"}
{"text":"Like a few recent reviews,  I've too been coming here for a long time, over 12 years. I've always let the small things slide, a bad server here and there. During my recent  visit my friends and I came in for a quick beer. I didn't have my wallet so I simply asked for water. The waitress very rudely asked me to leave. I questioned her about it, she simply coped out with \"it's upper management\" Upset, I emailed their management and they assured me this is not their policy. This was not the first time with bad service, just the worst and the one that will make me not return again. Good beer, yes,  but you better hope you don't run into a server having a bad day here!"}
{"text":"I've been going here a few times a year for over 14 years just for the bread pudding. After our recent experience, I'm really disappointed.  Over the years our service has been anywhere from Excellent to worthwhile (average).  Having been a server many moons ago, I always leave at least a 20% tip for average service.  Yesterday was the first time I've left 15% in I can't remember how long.  If it wasn't for the bread pudding I would NOT be going back and I would have left 1 star.    So, expect good/great food and crappy service."}
{"text":"I loved this bar when I went to ASU. I could always count on a fun live band and friendly bartenders. Great back patio area, definitely a nice change of pace from the \"Frat-tastic\" bars on Mill like Robbie Foxes and Cue Club. Some of the most memorable times shared with good friends were at this bar. I love the snake-bites (Guinness and Cider) and the Irish Car Bombs, and if you go on a Saturday the Sullivan's are usually playing and are always a good time."}
{"text":"Upon writing this review, I thought for sure that Rula Bula would get three stars, but based on Yelp's description, I just can't give it more than two. The \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" really is spot on.   The food isn't horrible and I really like the patio here, but there are just so many better places to go. I guess the only thing that keeps me coming back whenever I happen to be on Mill is the fact that they have a Cider on tap. But unfortunately, that isn't enough to outweigh the negatives.   First of all, I am confused by the fact that people can smoke on this patio. I'm not sure how the laws work, but my favorite patios around the city are completely non-smoking and I definitely don't enjoy smoke with my meal. The tables and chairs are not in good shape and the tables are often left a little dirty. The servers aren't very friendly and seem to be rather miserable. On our most recent visit my husband held the door open for one of the staff members who then directed us to \"seat ourselves wherever\" without a thank you or welcome. Kind of weird. The food that we've tried is so-so. I'm not a huge fan of the Irish delicacies, but their veggie sandwich is decent.   I do really like the patio because it's off the main street and hidden in the back. It's a good spot to hang out after an afternoon event at Tempe Town Lake. Rula Bula is by no means a bad place to spend a little time, but with so many better options around the city I don't know if I'll return."}
{"text":"I haven't had great fish n chips in a while. A good place that serves it fresh and authentic is hard to find...until now. Rula Bula is awesome when it comes to fish n chips. From the very first bite of the crunchy beer batter delicious flaky cod. You can taste how fresh the fish is. It's served with hot crunchy potatoes (chips) not fries like them other places. With a side of house made tarter sauce and coleslaw. I highly recommended this spot to anyone wanting and craving great authentic fish n chips. The staff is awesome and friendly as well and they've got a wide selection of brew on tap."}
{"text":"I used to like this place despite the fact that the customer service was lacking.  But after last night's display of utter disrespect and unprofessionalism of the manager, I will no longer waste my money in this establishment.  How does an Irish Pub hire a fantastic traditional Irish folk singer, then stop them half way through their show, publicly accuse them of driving off the crowd (nevermind the fact that he brought in his own crowd) and to be rude enough to say \"Maybe if you stop the crowd will come back.\"  And from what I've learned, this is NOT the first time management at Rula Bula has cut an act off mid-show and asked them to leave.  The professional thing to do would be to let them finish the show and then not ask them back if you didn't like them.  But no, that would be too tactful and nice for Rula Bula.  Give the talent the bum's rush in public.  Not only will I never set foot in Rula Bula again, I will spread the word to my 520+ friends on Facebook and ask them to do the same.  This was just an insult to watch."}
{"text":"Rula Bula is the Mike Piazza of Irish pubs.    You see, back in 1988, Piazza was the LAST player drafted by the LA Dodger in the 62nd round.  The 1390th pick overall.  One-fucking-thousand-three-hundred-and-ninetieth.  And many say that even THAT was a stretch and purportedly done as a favor from his childhood friend and Dodger manager Tommy Lasorda.  But Mike got to the majors and kicked some major ass to become the best slugging catcher ever and a 12-time All Star.  And that is the same story of how our little Irish spot on Tempe's Mill Ave came to the Bigs and started wrecking shop.  A number of years ago, when it started, it was a pretty drab, boring place.  Then they got their shit together, hosted some Irish folk bands, and renovated their backyard.  They started distancing themselves from frat bar to autonomous Irish pub and improved their drinks selection.  Then, they revealed these out-fucking-standing fish and chips combo which slotted them for the All-Stars of little-pub-who-could, underdog perseveres status.   Give me Varitek and his Irish pub up in Beantown, and I'll put Rula up against his without blinking.  Rula is THAT good."}
{"text":"Best fish and chips in Tempe. I don't know how they do it but it's so light and tasty. Your body doesn't hate you after dinner.   Plus the the decor and set up of the place makes you feel like you're in an Irish pub (this is a statement from someone who has never been in an Irish pub). Rula will have to suffice until my dreams match up with my pay."}
{"text":"For March's International Supper Club we picked Rula Bula, a local favorite Irish Pub in the Tempe area.   We were a party of 14, and for some parts our server struggled a bit with keeping orders straight, for got some drink orders, brought the incorrect ones but overall it went well. It was a few days before St Patrick's day and we were out on the patio area, and have to say while the weather was perfect, seating outside was the place to be, you sort of forgot that you were just right off Mill ave.  I ordered a Smithwicks and that was delish and hit the spot, then ordered some potato skins and 3 piece fish and chips. The potato skins to me were slightly over cooked, instead of the cheese being oozy it was a little crisp, but don't worry they still were eaten. I should have gone with maybe a 1 piece fish and chip because they do not skimp on the sizes! 3 where just too many! But the fish was perfectly fried, it was crisp and tender and flaky, I was bummed that I couldn't finish the dish haha it was so good!  Rula Bula does offer codes to paid for 2 hours of parking, call them and they will give it to you, some of us were even worried that we might run out of time before our meal ended but our server took our parking numbers and added more time to our tickets, I thought that was cool!  If you are looking for a fun local Irish Pub to chill and enjoy the surrounds, go the patio area and enjoy yourself at Rula Bula!"}
{"text":"Wonderful  brunch!  Great prices and wonderful service. Always a treat to eat a this restaurant. We always come back!"}
{"text":"I may as well write a review of Rula since already give over a healthy portion of my paycheck to them every weekend. I'm a fan. A Regular. The guy in the fedora who goes to other bars and gets asked \"Hey, aren't you the regular over at Rula?\" I'm also kind of biased, but i'm a Guiness fan. and I'm a cider fan. And Rula trained its bartenders on how to pour the perfect Snakebite (Yep, its Guiness and Cider, layerd. The Cider floats on the Guiness. Its neat-o!).   Ok, So. Rula. Probably has the largest back patio on Mill Ave, and on the weekends, it gets fill to the brim with every kind of stereotype that exists in the greater Phx area. Frat Boys mix with Foreign Exchange Students mix with Old Fogey's mix with Hipsters. And everyone gets along pretty much. When the occasional fight breaks out (as drunkards are wont to hit someone/thing at some point), Security breaks it up and gets the problem cleared away. Also, as its a large back patio with many tables, chairs, and people, and its a bar, people are going to be smoking. Cigars and cig's abound, and ashtrays as well.  If you don't want to be bothered by the smokers, feel free to meander through the crowd, back inside where, all the while on Friday and Saturday nights, there is really good live music playing (which, by the way, is who the 2$ cover to get in goes to). And for the most part, everyone gets along.  In the realm of food, Rula has the Irish fare down pat. The Boddington's Shrimp, the shepard's pie, the boxty, all are amazing, and decently priced. Don't come here and expect to order nachos and a second rate burger to add some flavor to your Coors and Bud Light's. They have real good food with real good beers. The servers are all friendly and quick, the management is pretty chill, and the over all feel of the place is relaxed. Its hard to feel tense while hanging out here.  Oh, and don't try to order beer from the bar back out back.  He's just so happens to be the best bar-back this side of the Mississippi, and keeps the outdoor bar running in top shape, but, trust me, as much as he wants to get you a beer and back amongst the masses, the poor guy is not allowed, no matter how much you bitch about it or how much money you try to throw at him. Wait for one of the bartenders, they'll gladly help you shortly."}
{"text":"Had lunch there with my ladies' monthly lunch group. They had some kind of event, so we are not allowed to park in the parking lot next to it. I had to turn around to park on the street or the garage. I parked in the garage, because it had a sign that business' validate.   Sat in the patio since the weather is still nice. Ordered the corn beef melt sandwich. It took longer than usual. I did not see a lot of people, but who knows? Got our lunches. The bread was toasted so it was soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. The corn beef was good (no salty). The swiss cheese melted perfectly on the corn beef. The potatoes are yummy. Service was OK. And they do not validate parking anymore."}
{"text":"Great Guinness!!! Would have received a \"5\" if they had 'All Day Irish Breakfast' on the menu."}
{"text":"My favorite pub in the city. Great layout, patio and atmo - second to none.  The food is the hidden gem, pretty much everything is amazing. The Guinness beef boxty is incredibly hearty and filling. Spicy bollux potato balls are off the hook."}
{"text":"Love this place. Amazing food, beer, and drinks. All the bar tenders are awesome. Servers are great. Their patio is amazing. Food is plenty of pages to choose from on their menu. If you are in Tempe try this place !  Great food also!"}
{"text":"I've always had fun at Rula Bula. Summer nights can get super packed, but that is typical of a Mill Ave bar. In the winter, they have heating lamps in the back, and it's warm and cozy out there. They have cider, which is sometimes hard to find.   In the summer, there was live music. My friend and I had some fun when they were playing Irish music one night."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Tempe. Great back patio for drinking and smoking. Nice staff and good appetizers."}
{"text":"Prompt service from staff when sitting inside. Big patio with a full service bar. The food wasn't great (bland and greasy), but if you're looking for beer this is a great place to go! Stereotypical Irish bar in the middle of tons of college students. Not what I was hoping to find."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped here on a whim and I'm glad we did! Rula Bula was a nice change from the quick paced eating experience you usually get on mill. I was a nice evening out so we opted to sit outside. The patio feels very private, surrounded by trees and decorated with strings of lights above.   The service was excellent and very attentive. I ordered the Vegetarian Shepherd's Pie while my friend ordered the Strawberry Salad with Chicken (each was about $18 after tip). I was thrilled with my meal and had more then enough for leftovers.   My only complaint was that there was a group of guys who were seated next to us half way through our meal. The group ordered cigars  and the smoke was blowing over to our table. If I hadn't already been served I would have asked to been moved as there was many other available tables.   Overall this was a great place to get away from the louder mill dining scene."}
{"text":"Pros: They have Strongbow. It's a wimpy cider but I still love it. - GREAT hamburgers. I love them much more than their Shepherd's Pie.  If you go there before 10, you won't get to hear the live music but at least you'll avoid the mass of drunk college kids swarming outside.   It's a bit more for the out of college crowd but perhaps that's why I like it."}
{"text":"Your average pub; I am not a big fan of Mill Avenue.  However, Rula Bula is a great place with good food, good selection of beer, good service & live music.  I only gave it four stars out of my own personal preference.  This is still a good selection if you like the college pub scene; you should definitely check it out."}
{"text":"This is a fun place with fun atmosphere. The menu has many options- not just Irish fare, from burgers to wraps to salads. The fact that they make a vegetarian shepherds pie puts them up there in my must have meals! I'm giving this a 4 star for the food and atmosphere. I think their outdoor patio is one of the best in the area. The only downfall to the place is the service. It is very hit or miss on how long you sit before someone gets to you- even on slow days. I would try it when you are not in a hurry and there to enjoy the patio and the outdoors!"}
{"text":"Loved this Irish Pub.  The fish and chips are truly the best - flaky, light, and crispy - with Irish chips that are great.  The Shepard's pie is amazing. I recommend getting the side of Brussels sprouts - they are tender and flavorful. Their Guinness pour is true perfection and includes a cool shamrock stamp in the foam. If the weather is nice, definitely opt to sit on the patio."}
{"text":"Food was awesome.. Music was great.. Service mediocre at best..  The corned beef melt was delicious .. The egg put it over the top"}
{"text":"Do not come here if u actually drink anything other than beer. They use a shot measurer & pour exactly 1 shot for a $6 drink. Cheap asses! I've watched a few bartenders do perfect pours on the Guinness so that's a little impressive. The food is okay and the service is okay.  The main thing going for this place is the patio and people you come with. It's in a pretty convenient location so it's not too far for people to meet up when coming from different parts of the Valley."}
{"text":"I have no idea what an Irish pub should look like but this place feels pretty close to what I might expect if I went over to Ireland.  Great food and atmosphere.  Received a hearty greeting at the door during my visit and that set a positive mood for the evening.  Ordered the shepherd's pie and was not disappointed in the least bit.  With some great friends, this place is a good time to be had =)  Cheers!  Update 12/13/2013 Had to update my review because of a recent visit that involved their \"Thirty-Five Dollar Steak\" (which isn't actually $35 but I would consider paying that much for it).  I know people might not consider getting a steak here but I would recommend it.  Especially with the sautéed mushrooms Irish whiskey peppercorn sauce.  The steak is delicious on its own, but that sauce is outstanding."}
{"text":"Love this place, fun and friendly environment. Staff are wonderful. Food is amazing. I don't know what they do to the mash potatoes but they are full of magic."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places on Mill Ave. I like Irish pubs and this place delivers. Drinks are good and it's worth visiting for lunch on food alone!"}
{"text":"I stayed in Tempe last weekend when I was visiting family, and my friend took me to Rula Bula. Initially, I said, I don't like Irish bars. But once I was introduced to Desiree at the back bar, I was hooked. She's a rad bartender, dealing with the crazy bar patrons while wearing a great smile. Not my favorite bar in the world, but Desiree made it a great night!"}
{"text":"This place has certainly gone way downhill. We were greeted by an eye rolling (literally) young woman. We waited briefly for a table, but then sat at that table for at least 15 minutes before being greeted by a server who wasn't even supposed to be ours. Tyler, our server, was outstanding. Otherwise, this whole lunch experience was awful. We waited 45 minutes for food when finally we asked to speak to a manager. The manager, Kevin, came over, finally, with our food. We expressed our frustration with the eye rolling and the 45 minute wait for food. He blamed the new hostess saying, \"She flooded the restaurant with tables.\" And, \" She doesn't know how to deal with stress.\" Next he offered us a free round or dessert. We declined as our one beer lunch had morphed into a 2 beer lunch already because of the wait. Kevin was sarcastic and condescending, and I almost died when he blamed the 19 or 20 year old hostess for all of the problems. When Kevin left our table, after not apologizing, we began eating and then realized our food was ice cold. I sent back the potato skins I ordered and asked Tyler to nuke my soup. When we received the bill, we were quite shocked to see nothing beside the skins I had sent back was removed from our bill. We paid our bill and way overtipped Tyler because he was great. At the end of our lunch, a random server had the audacity to come over to our table and sarcastically say, \" You ladies should come on A Monday. It's a lot less busy.\" As if complaining about waiting for 45 minutes is okay in any situation. This place is a mess and we will lot be returning. Terrible."}
{"text":"I was here on a rainy afternoon to meet up with a friend for a beer and some fish and chips, though I've never been in here at night.   That said, the fish and chips were money. As they should be. If an authentic Irish pub can't serve some solid fried fish filets, I lose quite a bit of respect for it.   The service was fine, but it's a little hard to guage from only seeing it one time during a slow afternoon. We sat outside undercover for a bit after we finished lunch and it has potential to be a great hangout area.   If I'm around Mill on St. Patty's, I will definitely be around Rula Bula."}
{"text":"It's not Casey's.  It's just not.  Not even close.  If you can get past that.  I think the food is better.  Guinness pours are on par with Casey's, and they have live music.  Sometimes it's even good! I like live music.  They have a back patio which is way smaller than Casey's and has no Blarney Stone.  The front area is too bright and too clean but they do have some cute stuff up on the walls.  It's a great place for drinking when it's not crowded.  St. Patricks at Rula is what's the word? Oh yes. Insane.  I have never made out with a girl in the bathrooms here.   I haven't decided if that's because Rula is too classy or I'm too classy.  Perhaps a bit of both."}
{"text":"We live in Tucson and wanted to visit this place as it's mentioned in a book series as having some of the best fish & chips in Arizona.  We drove up for brunch, I got Rula's Big Breakfast which was excellent!  The French toast was thick and moist and the Tullamore Dew dipping sauce it's served with is very tasty!  The fried chicken was also good but not really anything to rant about.  Their home fries on the other hand are absolutely worth the trip themselves (these are the chips served with the fish & chips).  My wife ordered the fish & chips and they came out crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, definitely a contender for best fish & chips.  This would normally warrant a 5 star rating from me, however a month later we visited again and both got the fish & chips, and while the chips were still just as spectacular, the fish wasn't the same.  The batter seemed thin and lacked the crispiness that the first time around had.  The food was still good, but it was just disappointing after having such an outstanding experience the first visit.  We plan to go again a third time in the near future and I'll update my rating depending on that trip."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place on mill! Their food is amazing ! :)  They also have a great selection of beers on tap as well. All of their bartenders , servers and bouncers are extremely friendly and knowledgeable.  The patio here is seriously one of my favorite places to drink and eat. They also have live music on the weekends so that's always a plus. Rula Bula I love you !"}
{"text":"This place is great. Super easy to work with, very personable service and great scenery! They flew the actual bar in from Ireland, so the whole establishment itself is a conversation piece!   The food has been consistently great, and the servers went out of their way to make my guests and myself feel at home."}
{"text":"The good:  Guinness tastes better here for some reason  Bar imported from Ireland is cool  great location with big outdoor area    The eh factor:  food is only OK  cover charge on weekends due to lame bands"}
{"text":"whether out back on the patio or in the bar.  It is fun. great college bar. Irish of ourse which means... people are getting drunk!   Tuesday night they have the open mic which is my style and as long as the place is not packed to the gills anynight RulaBula is a great place to make a new friend :)"}
{"text":"Brought a friend and family here for some beers and appetizers on New Years Eve before the party started.  Service was good, loved the place but noticed that the charge on my credit card was higher than what I signed, not by a lot but definitely higher \"tip\" than I wrote.  Beware!  I was just informed by Jason, the manager, that I'm in error, higher charge is only an authorization.  Correct charge is pending.  I will delete post when this is confirmed.  My apologies but this practice is unusual for the establishments I frequent in my home state."}
{"text":"This is so sad. Sitting at Rula bula for the last time. Been coming here a couple times a month for a couple years. We love this place. But not after today.  The service is so horrendous. Out waitress is so angry. We asked her to correct an error to the order and she got so put off like it was somehow our fault."}
{"text":"Classic Irish Pub on Mill. Perfect for fish and chips, a Guinness, and a great bar atmosphere!  The food here is great. I tried the fish and chips ($12) and it was perfect. Lightly battered, perfectly fried. The chips were different but complimentary to the meal.   They also had several cider beers on tap (my favorite). When I asked which beer I should try, the waitress offered bringing a sample of each so that I could know the beer before I committed to a pint. Great service!  The outdoor patio is great for parties. If it's cold, they have heaters during the winter. Summer has sprinklers. They've got live entertainment inside on weekends and also trivia nights. If you're looking for a place to hang that is casual and fun, try Rula Bula."}
{"text":"i didn't eat so i can't comment on the food but i do have a friend that has ordered their bread pudding twice and it's never arrived. their car bombs were good and the outside bar staff was friendly. i'll check it out again and try some food"}
{"text":"I had a night to kill in Tempe before my friends arrived for spring training the following morning so I called up some friends who graduated from ASU for some tips on what bars to hit on Mill Ave. Every single one of them said Rula Bula and now I see why. It wasn't the typical Scottsdale/Tempe club scene, which was nice. It's an old-looking Irish style bar with a stage, decent sized dance floor, and an awesome patio. There was a $2 cover, I'm assuming because they had a live band playing, but it was well worth it. I had a black and tan followed by a snakebite and both were delicious. I stayed for maybe an hour, watched the band, and met some cool people on the patio. Overall, a really fun place with a great selection of beer on tap and a fun, chill crowd that isn't overly into themselves."}
{"text":"Seems like there is a bunch of folks on here that got a wedgie just before they went in, maybe a trip to Sensations before your next visit?  It's just next door!  This place is an excellent excuse of an Irish Bar.  It is too big and airy for the Pub name.  To be fair, I do avoid this place on Fri and Sat nights, most of the other nights though it is a great, fun place to hang out.  They often have music, you can check the internet for details (sic).  One of my favorite aspects of this place is that inside and the back porch are two completely different feels.  I really like both, but prefer the porch at night unless there is good music.  Very chill and same stuff on tap and plate  The drinks here are expensive, but not necessarily over-priced.  The Guiness is thicker here, I think it is the imported kind.  They have an excellent selection of liquors, especially whiskey.  Their prices are better for expensive Irish Whiskey than other bars in the valley.   The food I've had is fusion Irish and very good.  The Beef and Guiness Boxty is heavy and delicious.  The salads are inventive.  Snacks are also good and high quality, the Irish Chips come with two great sauces and are a great snack over many drinks.  Go on a Thursday or Sunday night for dinner and drinks.  I think there is an open mic on Tuesdays"}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant/bar on Mill by far. Even if you're not a fan of the Irish, you'll enjoy their foods. Their Irish chips (kind of like potato fries/wedges) are amazing!!! And so is their irish (french) dip. Great Irish pub atmosphere, a little more mellow than most Mill bars, great outdoor bar/patio."}
{"text":"We were referred to try Rula Bula and a group of 8 of us were very pleased! We sat outside on the patio Friday night and it had a great vibe. One of our friends said it was the best burger they've ever had with another two loving the fish and chips.  All meals were delicious with very good quality and the prices were extremely reasonable especially with the food quantity served. Highly recommend for those in town to check it out."}
{"text":"My parents, family friends and I were going to eat here before seeing the Book of Mormon which started at 6:30. We all were gathered at a table no later than 4:30.  We probably ordered  our food about 10 minutes after we had all been seated. First off, the waitress didn't even get my order of a root beer correct and instead brought me Sprite (which I don't mind, but that's what you get when your waitress doesn't write down orders). Then she comes to us about 15 minutes later saying that the receipt that had printed out didn't get everyone's order so she had to come back to our table to find out two of the orders (again, what happens when you don't write down the orders...). After about an hour of us sitting around with no food she comes up to my father to let him know that she was just informed that there was no cod left. At the point we told the waitress that we had to leave in order to get to Gammage in time. That was probably the worst service I had ever experienced. Whatever is going on in the kitchen needs to be fixed. I am super hesitant to go back in case this happens again. I was really hoping to try a burger with pretzel bread. Guess I'll just stick to Casey Moore's. Atleast I can get a sandwich there much quicker."}
{"text":"went with the office mates last week for lunch - seated immediately (after leaving Oregano's when told 30-40 min wait); two of us had fish & chimps, one had Strawberry Salad with Chicken, another the Irish Club Sandwich and Onion soup.   Service from Ashley was excellent, even though we were inside and she also had to cover the few people out on the patio, she still had time to bring two  of us another pot off hot tea.   The fish was fresh and crisp and perfect cod; the salad was delicious, and L said the onion soup was one of the best she ever had, and she loved the sandwich. quick and efficient service, really good food, and free parking in downtown Tempe. What more could you ask for for Tuesday lunch?"}
{"text":"I'm usually here to drink and listen to live bands but ended up here on a Saturday morning randomly with some out of state friends. Had the rula bloody mary which was awesome and ordered the corned beef hash. So in all honestly let me day I have only had corned beef hash 2 other times in my life but I have seen other people order it many times and this was the breakfast of champions. It was so good. If your deciding besides this and something else...order this. Also they have a great outdoor patio area and are open early for day drinkers.  I'm not sure why so many complaints about the staff because everyone I've ever encountered there was pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and the food looks good, that is if you can get someone to it serve to you. We waited at a table for 15 minutes and I felt like I was behind the enchanted shield covering Story Brooke for all the notice we received. Any attempt to attract a waitress was as efficiently ignored as Fox News ignores the truth. I admit 3 waitstaff for 4 tables was probably taxing the abilities of the servers, so perhaps I need to cut them some slack. For your money, go to the George and Dragon."}
{"text":"Great local place where the age group is not all 21 year olds.  Live music on weekends and delicious food.   Indoor and outdoor bars. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"1st time here. Very good.  Had the corned beef sandwich with sweet potato fries.  Washed down with a glass of Malbec.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I like going to this bar on mill ave because it's very lowkey and rarely has any college students. The staff is very friendly and professional."}
{"text":"This is a really solid Irish pub/restaurant.  The food is quite good, especially the Guinness braised beef boxty.  For dessert, be sure to try the bread pudding, which is probably the best I've ever had.    It's a fun place when it's busy and has a great traditional Irish pub feel inside.  They pour a perfect pint; you'll notice the difference if you're a Guinness lover.  Rula Bula is a little pricey, which is the pretty much the only reason I haven't rated it a 5."}
{"text":"Holy crap, 7.50 for a dirty martini, and with crappy vodka...sometimes you just don't know how much I wish I didn't have an allergic reaction everytime I drink beer!"}
{"text":"Best Irish bar in town.  We frequent their back bar. The bartenders are always helpful, fun and attentive.  The best overall: April. She works inside 5-6 nights a week.  Their food is fantastic. I havent tried a bad thing yet. Beware the Boxty though, its HUGE.   Best shepherds pie in town (most places put cheese on it, and but put i mean stack 3 layers of greasy cheddar on top of the mashed potatoes)."}
{"text":"\"There are good ships, and there are wood ships - the ships that sail the sea. But the best ships - are friendships - and may they always be.\"  How can you begin a review of an Irish pub without an old Irish blessing? Let me start by saying, Rula Bula is the most understated bar on Mill Ave. Amongst the cherry pits, taverns and middle-aged somethings lurking at The Library Bar (why is that, anyway?) Rula Bula is like a big warm bear hug. The usually have a pretty steady lunch and dinner crowd - it could stand as a restaurant in its's own rite - fish and chips are not as greasy as some, and the potato \"rounds\" are perfect. My favorite is the Vegetarian Shepards Pie, but @ $10-$15 per meal we don't eat here frequently. BUT we do drink here frequently!    Around 9 or 10pm they have live live music every weekend. This is THE ONLY spot on Mill that you can find live, good local music. The bands change every night - but my local favorites are Shawn Johnson and the Foundation (a perfect blend of Hootie meets Sublime meets your favorite cover songs) and the Irish band that always plays there (I have no idea their name!) but they really bring down the house. Between 11 PM - 2 AM the band really creates a sort of \"collective\" atmosphere - everyone that is inside dancing (or jigging) to the music.   The crowd is the perfect blend of young college kids, late twenty-somethings and an older crowd. It has a great neighborhood, eclectic feel.   The drinks are average price - roughly $5 bucks for a mixed drink and $3 for a beer. My favorite is a Snakebite (which is 1/2 cider - which they have on tap- with 1/2 Guiness). If you like a lighter beer, try the Snakebite w/ Harp instead.   Like many of the other reviews have stated, they have a huge outdoor patio area (great if you aren't into the music and want something a bit more low-key).  Living in Phoenix 8 years, I have never been to a bar that makes me feel this good."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all of the buzz is about because this place wasn't that great! I had the grilled cheese and it was hard and dry!  There was this nasty drunk guy who sat across from our table and it was quite sickening! I will not be going back!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere in a great bar (totally imported from Ireland) and good fresh beer. Good food and even better to celebrate the Saint Patrick day's. You should stop here if you are around Mill."}
{"text":"If you love irish music, beer and liquor than this is your place. The food is good and the prices are average. Plus they are having promotions for their 13 year anniversary."}
{"text":"Kristen here! I like Rula Bula a lot. Like, a lot a lot. Rula Bula does not at all fit in with the trashy bars and overall poor restaurant selection on Mill Ave. It is a diamond in the rough, and it consistently transports me into a lively Irish pub, filled with authentic decorations and very very good food and drinks. I am not a fan of beer, but I am a fan of this place. Get the chicken pot pie or bangers and mash. You will not regret it. Love this place!"}
{"text":"This was my second year in a row coming here (I visit Phoenix every March for Spring Training). I brought my daughter here both times and we both very much enjoyed the Irish Lamb Stew and Irish chicken pot pie. The location in the heart of Mill Ave just blocks from ASU with all the action gives it a nice touch too.  I will probably make it a tradition to come back here for dinner every March when I'm in town for baseball."}
{"text":"This place was cool - exterior is painted bright, sunshine yellow. Very cheery, yes, but the color doesn't seem to scream \"Irish pub\" to me - hmmm, I dunno... Inside was very charming - exposed brick and lots of wood - very pretty and \"inviting\". My date and I had the Irish Nachos - Yumm-meee!! Love the spuds they used too - reminded me of homemade spuds my gramma used to fry up for breakfast.  I had a Blue Moon and it was pretty delicious. They had a band which actually rocked - they played songs from Tracy Chapman, Tomy Petty, etc.  Good place to go - it does get crowded, so I recommend getting there sorta early to get a good spot."}
{"text":"I know that most of my friends and I come here for the drinks for they have awesome food as well.  I used to come here all the time with my family when they visited because my Dad is Irish and loves any Irish pub.  They have a great Guinness beef puff pastry type deal, deliciously unhealthy mac and cheese and an awesome desserts.  I love the brown bread ice cream and their bread pudding!  And then once you've devoured all that food (if you can still move) they have great drinks and live bands!"}
{"text":"They charged me for iced tea that had a bug in it! I didn't want to argue about it so I just paid and left, I even tipped because I also bought my friend a beer. Disappointed by this experience."}
{"text":"The food here is good. Expensive though.  The Guinness pours are good. Expensive though.  Good whiskey selection...noticing a trend?  This place is expensive, especially for what it is. I mean, it is an 'authentic' Irish bar, brought piece by piece from Ireland...but aren't they all now? There are so many 'authentic' Irish bars that there is actually a cottage industry in salvaging pieces of Irish pubs and sending the pieces to America.   I don't think it should mean that everything is $2 more than it should be.   The food is good though!"}
{"text":"It was a quiet night in the Bula, friendly greeting from the hostess team. A pleasant red hair Irish lass showed us to our table.  At first seating we were put into an empty corner, our waiter Robby was happy to have us. He gave a crisp recommendation for the combo app's. Robbie my man, good call. Wings, skins, fish and yummy dippings, ranch, sour cream and tartar. Loved the frosted beer glasses, not your typical bar glass, really liked it.  We had an eclectic parade of people sitting in our section, week day, early evening probably has a different feel than other times.  Robbie made another good call on sword fish & halibut recommendations. We really liked his humor and repartee. Nice job Robbie!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of the Kevin Hearne Iron Druid series so of course I had to try the food at Rula Bula!  I must say, I was not disappointed. We were there for Brunch and I ordered the AZ Burger with Rula Bula house fries as well as a a side of Bangers to share, and it was all quite yummy!  The burger was huge and cooked exactly to order and the fries were nice and crispy (the coffee was quite good too).  I had never tried a Banger before, but once again I was not disappointed; it's kind of like a cross between a Braut & a breakfast sausage.  The wait staff was very attentive as well as friendly and we did not want for anything.  The ambience was relaxed and fun and patio seating was available. Can't wait for our next trip to the Tempe area to try another menu item!"}
{"text":"Very very disappointed in this place and i've been there a few times.  Last time i was there I ordered out. First off the person (i believe the manager) took forever to input the order (burger, fries, wings and macaroni). So I'd assume the time it took he would have gotten it correct   I get the order, take it home only to discover no burger and fries. Great and i live too far to just come back to get the cold food.  So he agrees to refund my whole order back to my credit card. Well a week later and STILL no refund back. So will now have to file a dispute."}
{"text":"When I'm in Tempe, so far, there is only one place I need to go to, and that's Rula Bula.  I'm a huge fan of their sister place, Lis Doon Varna, and they basically have the same menu.  I love the fish & chips, and I have no problem downing 3 pints of Guinness there.  Great place, and great times."}
{"text":"The bouncer shined his light in my friends eyes multiple times on our first stop to her 23rd birthday.  Not only does he almost bend mine and my friends id in half so much to where it creases or breaks but also just stares at us and disregards our small talk asking him how he's doing. Then as we exit the bar he makes kissy counts very loudly and obnoxiously and throws small balls of paper at us. Like no."}
{"text":"How in the world did I not know that Rula Bula had such a fantastic patio!?!??  I'm a native, and have never visited Rula until last night.   Wow, seriously, who knew?  I guess a ton of people.  Everytime I am in Tempe, which isn't very much, I see that place and it just looks so crowded and small and I hate shoulder to shoulder places.  So I was quite surprised when we walked out to the patio just in the nick of time to grab a table and relax.  Didn't try the food but the service was great.  My water glass was always full, and I never had to wait for my next refill on the blue moon.  Also, one of our group asked for a vodka soda, and the waitress said, it's cheaper if  you are having more than one to jsut get a tall double.   WHAT?  Did I just hear a waitress try to save a patron some mula?  Crazy...I need to go back and see what their Bar Food is like.  Great chill laid back atmosphere for a Wednesday night in Tempe."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visits to this lovely establishment during a recent visit to Tempe. Service was friendly and attentive and the food was tasty too! If I find myself in the area again I will make sure to stop by for another round."}
{"text":"I went here a few weeks ago on a Friday night after I got off of work.  I guess I should start by saying that the only reason I gave this review 2 stars instead of 1 is because Rula Bula covered my friends tab the next day when he went back to settle the situation.  My friends and I had been there for about an hour before it was time for last call.  One of my friends had opened a tab, and upon attempting to pay it and retrieve his card, he was told that the system was down and that he was going to have to wait until the following morning to get his card back.  In fact, there were about 10 people still waiting at the back bar by 230 who were trying to pay their tabs and get cards back.  I had cash on me and even offered to PAY MY FRIEND'S TAB AND EVEN LEAVE A TIP, just so we could get his card back and go home!!  Then, when I explained to the manager that it was illegal for him to hold my friend's card over night, he said \"Thank you inquisitor\" and told me he didn't need a lesson in the law!  Then when I told him I did not think it was befitting of a manager to talk to a customer in his establishment that way he just dismissed me as drunk and walked off in huff and went back in the building!  At that point, an employee who was still out by the back bar even suggested that my friends and I go get a police officer to settle the issue!  I work down the street from these guys and I would never want to bring the cops into someones place like that.  However,  I can honestly say that it is because of my experience with the manager that night at Rula that I even created this Yelp account.  I will never go to that bar again.  If you want a good pub setting with a good staff go to Casey Moore's on Ash just off of University."}
{"text":"We visited during the Tempe Art Festival which is a busy time but this location was fantastic. The waitress made a couple of mistakes but everything was served well and our family enjoyed being able to sit outside. I loved the bread pudding and the peach cobbler cocktail, I hope to go back soon!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Co-workers, friends and I come here for lunch and happy hour quite a bit. My favorite dish is the fish and chips: their ale batter is great and the lunch-sized portion is huge and very reasonably priced. Desiree is one of their servers/bartenders and she is ALWAYS exceptionally cheery, friendly and attentive. In addition to loving the food and atmosphere, the staff members, like Desiree, are the reason we keep coming back and recommending this place to others. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a long time.  Great atmosphere. Love the decor and loved our waitress Cara or Carl (she has a soft voice and we heard carl) . Lol. The fish and chips were fantastic. My husband had the ultimate cheese sandwich and loved it and so did I when I ate the other half that night. Absolutely orgasmic. Onion soup was great. We will definitely go back. So much more I liked about the place but I'm not gonna tell you, you're just gonna have to go find out for yourself."}
{"text":"Pretty much always live music which makes this place awesome! they have deals on drinks often which is great! I enjoy coming here,"}
{"text":"FOOD: After several nights of liberal boozing at Rula Bula, I just ate here for the first time today. The fish and chips are amazing!! Not only is the cod great, but the chips are the best I've ever had. The menu offers other popular Irish courses, too. The beer selection isn't the greatest, but they do have a couple good choices.   PRICE: The dishes are decently priced, but the beer is relatively expensive. A pint was $5.50.   ATMOSPHERE: This place is covered in wood on the inside, giving it that authentic pub ambiance. But at this time of year (spring), you gotta eat outside under an umbrella in the courtyard out back. It doesn't get much better than eating delicious fish and chips, sipping on a pint of brew in warm weather with friends. At night, it can be a fun, lively place to party. On the weekends, not sure which night, they have live bands playing. Cover will be $2 on these nights.   SERVICE: Great staff  SKINNY: Rula Bula is a double threat! I've been having great times at Rula Bula at night, and just had an even better time chowing down during the day. Best fish and chips in Tempe. Decent bar with great atmosphere. I'm making this my fish and chips haven!  Here's to a long life and a merry one. A quick death and an easy one. A pretty girl and an honest one. A cold beer--and another one!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, my experience at Rula Bula was not very good.  I came here with a large group, about 15 of us for dinner.  We were at a conference at the Tempe Mission Palms Hotel next door.  Rula Bula was very convenient to the hotel.    The coordinator of the dinner made a reservation, and the restaurant was able to accommodate our group and one or two other large groups.  So, space was not a problem.  As happens many times with big groups, service is challenging.  Things started off fine with water being served and drink orders.  The difficulty began when the drinks were delivered.  The server could not remember who ordered what.  We had to do a lot of reminding about out orders.  This persisted throughout the meal.  I ordered the corned beef and cabbage - a traditional Irish staple that should have been really good.  It wasn't.  The meal came with a modest amount of corned beef and cabbage.  Most of the plate was take up by boiled potatoes and carrots.  The veggies tasted ok, but there were a lot of them.  The corned beef was not anything special.  In fact, it was clear that it had been reheated because there were some dry burnt pieces.  There was very little cabbage in my serving.  The cabbage that was there was mediocre at best.  Corned beef and cabbage is one of my favorite meals.  What I got at Rula Bula was a big disappointment for me.   Others in my group said their meals were ok.  The delivery of the meals was an issue too because the person sitting next to me received her meal a good 15 minutes after I received my meal.    Positives were that the restaurant was willing to give all of us separate checks, and the server was very friendly.  Too bad the food and delivery did not measure up."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. From the old time look of the outside/inside (which transitions to a more elegant and modern patio in the back) to the music they play; if I didn't know any better I would say they were streaming my personal playlist: punk/rock/alternative/irish rock. Haven't tried the food personally but it looks good from what I've seen. Attentive and friendly staff and a good selection of drinks. Prices aren't anything special but the atmosphere makes up for that, it is on mill after all. My only complaint is that they charged a ridiculous cover on St. Pattys day so with the tip included I think I paid 20 dollars for 1 beer. Will update with more visits."}
{"text":"I was working in Tempe for a couple of weeks and was wanting to listen to or join-in at a local Irish Session.  I saw that they have live music so I called to see if they had a regular session.  The woman who answered didn't know what an Irish Session was but said that she was relatively new there.  I called back the next evening and the guy that answered was not only clueless about what an Irish Session is, but he seemed irritated that I was asking and hung up on me.  I think this place is about as Irish as a Bar Louie that serves Guinness.  If you are looking for a college bar that pretends to be Irish... this is your spot."}
{"text":"A favorite of my wife's, Rula Bula is a cool Irish pub located on Mill Ave. They have an excellent outdoor patio so when the weather break in AZ expect this place to be packed. With rotating beers on draught (good selection to boot), and a full bar you'll have plenty of drinking options.   The food is actually good! Well above standard pub grub fare- try the Irish sliders. Staff is usually pretty cool, but they can get a little testy when the pace is crowded. You may even wait a bit between drinks."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great atmosphere great food and friendly staff. I have had there fish and chips (Best in Phoenix). Mouth watering burgers and awesome loaded potato skins.  Great place to go for dinner or just go out for a beer. This is my favorite place on mill."}
{"text":"Love this place. Fun pub with amazing patio bar. Good selection of beers, great staff and the food I've tried so far is excellent."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer after being out for dinner with friends. Its an Irish Bar so was nice to see Harp (and other Irish beers) on tap.. Stayed only for 45min then headed home.  Nice joint - its a bar in Tempe, so its usually busy!"}
{"text":"This is one of the few places on Mill Avenue that I still like to drink at. Although you still get the ASU crowd, which makes me feel old, you still have a great time. On Friday and Saturday nights Rula Bula charges a cheap cover, but you also get some live entertainment, and you drink at one of the few places in Arizona which actually pours a Guinness correctly. Rula Bula also has a big patio, so on a nice night, it's a perfect place to hang out.   Tonight my cousin happened to be in town when he chose to give up his seat on his overbooked connecting flight. Since his hotel was right down the street from Mill, it was a convenient spot to get a beer and something to eat. We both drank a black and tan, which was excellently mixed. The food was actually pretty good. I just went with a corn beef melt, which was an alright sandwich. It was on ciabatta bread, which was doesn't quite compliment corn beef the same way that rye bread does. Nothing spectacular, but not bad. My cousin had chicken sliders which he seemed to enjoy. There also was a big selection of more authentic looking Irish dishes, but neither of us were hungry enough for anything bigger than what we had."}
{"text":"Always amazing service, Brian D. Is beyond a great waiter!!! I recommend going to see him, very pleasant and just great customer service. The drinks and food are great. Try the Rula Bula wings, they are awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Rula Bula is my favorite bar on Mill Avenue, but I'm a huge fan of all things Irish.  Did you know Rula Bula is gaelic for \"rough and tumble\"?  I sent a photo to my friend in Dublin and he informed me of the translation.  We always get the pickle back shots when we go.  If you've never experienced a pickle back, you need to.  It is a shot of Jameson chased with a shot of pickle juice.  It does not sounds good, but it is flippin amazing.  My friends who aren't huge whiskey fans love them as well as it will kill the afterburn in your throat.  I love the Guinness BBQ sauce (my Irish pal says that's blasphemy, but it's because he hasn't tried it), so try the burger with the BBQ sauce.  This bar is also good for getting the various Irish draughts like Harp (Northern Ireland) and Smithwicks (Republic of Ireland), not to mention the Guinness staple.  We like to hang on the patio, but dining in the restaurant is just as fun.    Sláinte!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here after work on Saturday for Happy Hour. Three dollar sixteen ounce blue moons and three dollar irish nachos= after work bliss! Happy Hour goes until seven! Love the atmosphere of a pub!"}
{"text":"I really like this pub. I have been to alot of crappy Irish pubs but this one is definitely not one of them. It was a great place to go on a sunday night to meet an old friend out for drinks.  They have very ample pub style seating, and a really awesome patio out back. The bartenders are cool and there are good amount of beers on tap. I had the kiltlifter mainly because the name is funny but it turned out to be a great beer that a had a few more times throughout the week while I was in Tempe.  My next trip out I will be trying the food as I have heard some good things about it."}
{"text":"I, like many others, went to Rula Bula for St. Patrick's Day festivities. And BOY! was it busy! Knowing that it's an Irish bar lent itself to a crowd, but I was impressed by the bar itself. My friend and I went to the back patio (even more crowded than the inside), where we drank, smoked some cigs and watched some Irish Step.   The back patio bar was helpful, friendly and fast, too! One EXPECTS to wait on St. Patrick's Day, but I never waited more than 3 minutes for a drink. We didn't partake in any food, but what I did see looked not only delicious, but Irish-authentic.   My complaint lies in the bathrooms. Ladies have 2 (!!!) stalls and on a busy night, you'll wait longer for the bathroom than you will a drink. Come on! When will businesses learn?!   Impressive bar staff, cool atmosphere, reasonable drink prices. Thank you, Rula Bula, for restoring my faith in Tempe bars!"}
{"text":"Rula BULA! A great name and place. I went to eat around happy hour with my Mom, BF and baby. We got nicely greeted and promptly seated! Lol It was starting to pick up when we got there, with a few 6 and 7 tops. I got the Vegetarian Shepherds Pie and since I love veggies and lentils, it was delicious! My mom got the fish and chips, and we really dug the Irish chips. My BF got a burger and the bun was amazing. Baby had grilled cheese, wish they would've of suggested wheat bread, but that's ok. The portions were great, definitely plentiful. The waitress was good, no mess ups, quick with everything. I would give 4 1/2 and the only reason is is because she didn't say her name! But other then that great food, great svc and experience:)"}
{"text":"The kitchen was down when we went to visit, so it was just Guinness and Green Spot. The place has a great vibe. Looking forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"Great night tonight at an old favorite!  Perfect service, thank you Ryan!  DH's medium rare requested steak came out closer to well done.  Well, this diner is ever afraid to return anything back to the kitchen, but they were so accomadating.  I just love this place."}
{"text":"Ok, we're Iron Druid geeks so we had to eat here.  I didn't kick Oberon under the table so we couldn't give him any of our fish and chips.  With that said...  The Fish and Chips are GREAT.  Everyone had a great meal, so much so that we went back for lunch the next day.  And again we were completely satisfied with our meals.  (that's 2 for 2, or 100%)  So it's an Irish pub with bar type food, but it's really good food.  So go eat here.    And if you see a guy with knotted tatoos from his foot up to his neck say hi."}
{"text":"Beautiful patio in the back you HAVE to sit at. There are heaters so during the winter you are still fine. Try the Rula Bula Irish coffee if you want a drink to warm you up! Always great servers and bartenders that will actually talk to you."}
{"text":"This place is like the Irish pub equivalent of London Bridge in Lake Havasu City. The main attraction is the whole history of it being a pub shipped in from Dublin.   Truthfully, the saddle shop is a good looking bar.   Anyway, got the beef and Guinness pie (about $15) -- more of a stew with big chunks of beef with a French roll-looking piece of puff pastry laid on top. It tasted much better after shredding up the meat and mixing in some mashed potato.   My boyfriend got the shepherd's pie lunch special (about $8). While his entree was decent, he got salad as a side, which he said was very heavy on the vinegar.   Overall, the food and service were decent, but the prices were fairly high for these traditional dishes. It's worth stopping by for a beer at least once."}
{"text":"Very cool place to hang out.  The food is good, drinks are plenty!"}
{"text":"Bartenders are friendly and the environment was chill. i liked it"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch for the first time yesterday and my only regret is that we haven't tried this place sooner! The atmosphere is awesome- laid back and inviting. They have a prime location and are right next to a metered parking lot. Parking is free (for 2hrs) if you're eating there so make sure you get a code to use at the meter before you eat! The beer selection reminded us of our time in Ireland and we were surprised to be able to get Kilkenny, which we haven't found many other places in the States anymore.   The food? DELICIOUS! Skip the fries, get the Irish chips! Our server, Rachel, was right on top of things too. I don't think we really had to ask for anything because she anticipated what we'd need and she was spot on with her food recommendations too. The chicken tenderloins were house-made and delicious! So much better than anything from a chain restaurant. Their mac & cheese can be a \"create your own\". My husband tried it with shrimp and said it was some of the best he's had. Also, the patio is huge! Hopefully next time we go it'll be a little warmer so we can sit outside and enjoy the weather and great food!"}
{"text":"I changed jobs a few months ago and am now working in the Mill Ave area. Once again (previously at Old Town Scottsdale) I find myself writing about cool bars with tons of reviews containing details of fun nights on the town from the perspective of a working stiff grabbing a quick bite on her lunch break. Oh, well, c'est la vie!  First off, I was expecting a kind of dingy dive bar but the interior is actually quite nice looking. I liked all the little Irish knick-knacks they had around the place. And even though there were a couple of signs advertising whiskey and Guinness, there weren't a ton of neon signs everywhere... so during the day, the place really does not scream \"college bar!\" at all. The seating was comfortable and I liked that there was both an open area where you could push some tables together for a large group and also an area separated by a couple stairs with some semi-private booths. Our server was friendly and attentive and the food came out really quick.  I ordered the strawberry salad because I knew I was having a big dinner later that evening and I didn't want to fill up. Surprisingly, instead of the boring iceberg lettuce you would expect from a bar salad they had a nice spring mix. The strawberries were very fresh and the grilled chicken was cooked perfectly. All the flavors worked really well together and the only criticism I have is that the dressing was a tad too sweet. Overall, a really tasty salad. My fellow lunch companions ordered a burger, fish and chips, and shepherd's pie. All of their plates looked really good and they all enjoyed their food. I will definitely order the shepherd's pie next time since this is a favorite dish of mine and they serve a nice small lunch portion that you can get with a salad to keep the meal from being too heavy.  Hopefully I'll get to try this place for a few drinks in the evening some time but until then I will definitely be back for lunch."}
{"text":"A little back story: I'm from AZ, but went out-of-state for college. Somehow, I was able to graduate in 4 yrs, while most of my friends who stayed home were on the 5 to 5 1/2 year plan. Well, this meant when I moved back to AZ after graduation I got to relive my last year of college all over again (this was fun at times, but not so much at other times since I had a job), and at the time I really enjoyed Rula Bula. Compared to some of the other bars on Mill, this ones seems to attract a less douchey crowd and shockingly what appears to be more a slightly more mature group of ASU students (there is such a thing!).   Even after outgrowing the Mill scene, this was one of the few bars along the street I would still occasionally go to. Over this past Christmas weekend when I was in town visiting I came here with a group of friends and a good time was had by all!!! There's nothing about this place that particularly stands out. We had a super cooperative waitress on this last visit who had no problem keeping track of individual tabs and kept the drinks flowing (everything from long islands to car bombs!).  There's both an indoor and outdoor bar w/patio and both bars have multiple bar tenders so things move quickly.   I've never had the food here, but I've heard from people who have that's it's good. The bouncers are nice as well (it didn't happen this last time, and I'm not sure if they do anymore, but if I remember correctly in the past they do charge a small cover occasionally when there's live music). Not that it's a big deal for me, but the bathrooms are not the cleanest. Ladies, if your bathroom looks the same, sorry."}
{"text":"Sheperd's pie and Fish and Chips were AMAZING! ESPECIALLY THE CHIPS!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place.  I just can't forgive the constant fish smell, the asshole security detail, and the lack of air conditioning moving about."}
{"text":"Beware of the parking policy. The sign outside says go into Rula and get code. Which we did only to find out that before it could be entered a $44 ticket was issued. The meter maid then lied and said just call the city on Monday and they'll dismiss it because there's nothing she could do once it's issued. Called and emailed the city, played several rounds of \"not my job\", finally had to return to Tempe, setup a court date. Which by the way can ONLY be on Friday. Can't wait to goto court and have the final city official completely let me down and remove all faith I have left in humanity.  The city completely blames Rula Bula saying they should just discount our bill and their policy is at fault. However the food at Rula Bula is good and I love their tap selection, this was only my second time there for food and sadly I won't return. The staff was nice, waitress was too new to judge harshly for our hiccups inside but the parking situation is a problem."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed going to Rula Bula's and I have been there many many times over the last 10 years.  It has a great selection of beverages, good food, and reasonable prices.  I do not find the staff as friendly as at other Irish Pubs.  This was not always true, but I am not as satisfied as I used to be with Rula Bula's.   Some of the staff are very good, but others are lacking."}
{"text":"Though the Irish economy is in trouble more often than it is not (and I'm not bashing, I'm a Murphy on my mother's side and built like a potato farmer) one can't argue with the success of its number one cultural export, Irish bars. I've been to a number of cities a round the world and the one thing I'm almost always certain to find, is an Irish bar, and Rula Bula is a wonderful example of what they are like when they are done right. In addition, I don't know how long it has been in its current location, in the historical Andre building, which was built in the lat 1800s, but it has been around at least almost 20 years, since I've been living in Phoenix and the food and the quality of the adult beverages have stayed remarkably consistent.  I'm not a huge fan of Irish food but this place does fish and chips quite well and they know how to pour a Guiness right and when the weather is nice nothing beats the outdoor seating area. Oh, and did I mention the establishment is in sight distance of the third street and Mill Avenue light rail station?   I don't do the late nights like I used to when I was younger but over the years I've had some fun times in Rula Bula and if you are young and want a fun place to have a few drinks and hang out with friends, I don't think you can go wrong with a place like Rula Bula."}
{"text":"This is a fun little pub! Great variety of beers, on top of a full bar (liquor) and a pretty decent menu! A group of friends and I went here and each of us were happy with everything. The loaded potato skins were just enough to fill my belly, nothing special about them, but still good. The french onion soup and clam chowder were delicious and the chicken fingers, A - OK! Next time I go I would like to try some of their famous main dishes so I can leave a better review. We kind of ate from their appetizer menu, so nothing different and exciting. The place is usually hoping on the weekends, because it is located on Mill. They have live bands, a small dance floor, inside seating and a large outside patio with tables and a full bar. The servers, bartenders and bouncers are all quite nice, its a fun atmosphere! :)"}
{"text":"I've been here before and the food was ok. Today the whole experience was worthy of a one star review. I called this morning to inquire about bringing my 16 year old daughter there today to celebrate Saint Patrick's day. I spoke to a manager and was told that we were more than welcome to stop in anytime before 9pm. After 9, everyone needs to be 21, I said we were coming down for the food.  We got there about 3:30 in the afternoon, we started to walk through the door and the employee at the door says its $5.00 cover for each of us. I said, we came to eat, his response, I don't care. The cover is $5.00.   I mentioned that I had called earlier and asked about bringing my 16 year old daughter down, and was him there was no problem.  Someone came out, claiming to be a manager and let us in to eat. Of course, I still had to pay $10 for the pleasure of walking through the door.   The food was really bad, it was just thrown together. I get it, it's a drinking holiday, it was busy, the food came quick, but it was a mess. And, served on a paper plate, with a plastic knife and fork.  Lesson learned, never returning on Saint Patrick's day.   I just called and talked to a manager named Brandon, his professionalism and apology has inspired me to add an additional star. I was offered to come in again and he would take care of my meal, I declined.  The guy at the door, could do well with some serious customer service training. He was not very welcoming at all."}
{"text":"First off I want to say thank you to Rula Bula for allowing a large Wednesday group to monopolize a fairly large part of their restaurant last night.  We had a double birthday which drew out about 25 of us.  We were seated, served and managed by two very capable servers.  This isn't why I'm writing the review though.  Like most \"Iron Druid\" fans I associate Rula Bula with Fish & Chips which is what I always order here, but last night my boyfriend and a few others ordered the \"Comfort Food\".  Good Gravy!  This was amazing and now I can't imagine trying anything else.  Do you like Mac & Cheese? Do you like fried chicken? Bacon? Brown Gravy? Do yourself a favor and make the trip to Downtown Tempe."}
{"text":"Came here to catch up with an old friend a few weeks before classes started, so the area was a lot less crowded than it would be today. It's at a great location right on Mill Avenue, and we sat up at the bar for a late lunch.  Originally just planning on catching up over a Guinness, we decided to check out the lunch menu and I ended up ordering a pretty delicious burger. The Irish chips that accompanied the burger were a great break from normal French fries; a couple dashes of malt vinegar made them perfect. I'd highly recommend giving them a shot if you haven't tried them before.  Rain started pouring as a monsoon swept through Tempe during lunchtime, and the weather just happened to complement the Irish decor perfectly. We ended up striking up a conversation with the bartender and found out that he grew up in a neighborhood next to mine back in California. He even ended up showing us a few of his bartending tricks. Great guy, great food, and a great experience."}
{"text":"Had a work happy hour here. The patio in the back is nice and large in the back. This was a surprise since the restaurant storefront looks small from the street.  The waitress was a little overwhelmed with our large group of about 30. The apps were freshly brought out and we devoured each plate as it came out.   Misters and fans would have been nice since it is still pretty hot in the evening. Like 80 degrees.  Nice bonus is validated parking for 2 hrs."}
{"text":"Great food, great live music, awesome patio, superb beers, need I say more? Definitely the best hangout on Mill Avenue!"}
{"text":"I have worked on Mill for over a decade and Rula Bula has stood the test of time in my restaurant rotation. Last Friday I went for happy hour, and yesterday for lunch. Both expierinces were so pleasant I thought it high time to yelp it.   Happy hour was great. Our bartender was attentive and funny and made sure to come around before last call. They have some great apps on special, chicken fingers, skewers, potato skins ect.   Their lunch menu features weekly specials, so there is always some thing new and different to try. I went there with a group of 5 ladies and we everyone was happy with their choice. I had the grilled cheese on marble rye (with tomato and 4 types of cheese this sandwich is delicious), I have tried the boxtys, potato pies, bangers and mash, french dip and salmon - all great. Our dining experience was enjoyable last week mainly do to our server (Nathan?). He split our bill without being asked and had boxes and change before we finished eating. When you're on a lunch break, not having to wait around at the end of your meal is a big plus.   Rula Bula has a great outdoor patio, fun pub atmosphere, excellent Irish pub food and is located right off the Light Rail.  You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"We chose to sit on the patio to enjoy the amazing weather. Our server was very friendly and made a fantastic dinner recommendation. I knew the fish and chips here were the best in town, but I was pleasantly surprised to discover how tasty their fried shrimp is as well."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, the portions generous, the atmosphere authentic, and they have Smithwick's on tap, a sure sign of a true Irish pub.  Also, we were pleasantly surprised to get 15% off our tab for having just seen a play at the Gammage!   We'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Sorry, Rula Bula.  You went from being my favorite bar, to one of the worst.  The people that take your money at the front are downright rude.  The guy with the round glasses tried to snatch the money out of my hands before I handed it to him which is NOT okay with me.  The new management is terrible.  Things used to run smoothly but now it seems as though it's always a mess.  One night we had to pay a cover and the bathrooms weren't even working.  REALLY?  There are far too many other places to spend my hard earned money; I'll take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Rula Bula is a great pub on Mill. They have a band every now and again--on these days, there is a small cover so bring a bit of cash.  The waitstaff is really friendly here. I came here a lot during World Cup time (even at like 10 in the morning) and they were giving away free glasses. Rumor has it that the owner gets beer glasses by the box and they are piled up on the 2nd floor of the restaurant (incentive for owner: I will change my rating to a 5 star if you contact me via Yelp and give me some beer glasses. dead serious).  The Happy Hour prices are pretty good and the beer selection on tap is great. If you're visiting for the first time, sit on the patio. It is no joke bigger than the inside and much more fun. If you go around Happy Hour time, the sky will have AZ sunset colors and it makes for a really great experience."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Gotta go here if in town. Very friendly and knowledgeable bartender helping me, the ND fan before the ASU GAME."}
{"text":"Great Irish bar/restaurant with a really good menu! I always enjoy their food. Inside and outside seating on mill ave. The last time I ordered take out it was a debacle, but when dining in it's great."}
{"text":"The food is what you would expect from an Irish pub.  Decent, but not memorable.  The atmosphere, however, is pretty awesome.  It's a great place to relax and hang out with friends.  Sit out on the patio, if the weather permits.  They do have misters, which we know is a lifesaver during Phoenix summers.  I'm told that their beers are awesome, but not being a personal beer-drinker, you'll have to judge for yourself. :)"}
{"text":"My daughter's favorite restaurant to go to my whole family loves this place I don't think there's anything that we don't like their"}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars on Mill! Love it because it's not full of douchey frat boys or dirty old creepers hoping to score with a college chick. Like garlic with vampires, the Irish theme seems to keep the bros away. Like anything slightly foreign is too hard for them to understand so they think \"screw it, let's go to vintage\" or one of those other horrible places. I also like that it's pretty casual. Sometimes a girl doesn't want to wear high heels and a short tight dress sometimes a girl wants to rock jeans and converse and slug down a Black and Tan. Just saying..."}
{"text":"Went here after work with a couple of my co-workers.  The weather was nice so we opted to be seated in their patio area. We didn't realize it was whiskey and cigar night so the smell of cigar smoke lingered around, but nothing too serious there. The music was a bit too much though. It was just blaring and hard to hold a conversation.  I ordered the Fish and Chips. These were wonderful. The fish wasn't greasy or falling apart. The chips are bite-sized potato circles. That's the best way to describe them.  My co-worker got her typical order of salmon and she said it is always delicious. My other co-worker got mac and cheese with jalapenos. The jalapenos were not included so that was a bummer.  Great beer selections here as well from domestic to craft.  Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Went to this bar for the first time with a friend and had a blast. We went to the bar inside and they had a band playing that played music to dance to. We sat at the bar and the service was awesome. Our bartender TJ was amazing. Our drinks were so good and he was a awesome bartender. And even though he was busy he always made sure we were doing ok. Great bar, great atmosphere, and amazing bartender. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Rula Bula is probably my favorite spot in Tempe.  They have a solid selection of beers, lots of whiskeys to choose from, and the wait staff is friendly and attentive.  I usually prefer to hang out outside on the great big patio with a group of friends, but the inside is just as inviting."}
{"text":"since it's opening, I've been to Rula Bula more time than I can count, and each time has been a great experience, the best feature is when the weather is right, a nice meal and drinks on the patio can't be beat. a stones throw from Tempe mission palms, and in the shadows of the old flour mill.  Drinks, food, service, and entertainment are great, Remember we're a collage town, and this is almost a necessity."}
{"text":"I have been to Rula Bula quite a few times and cannot really remember anything memorable about it, so I was a little concerned selecting it as the starting place for my groups pub crawl. I was actually really pleasantly surprised with the outcome despite a few less-than-desirable things.   The patio area was a great choice. Plenty of room to accommodate our large crowd, both smokers and not. They also have Strongbow, which made me happy (just wish Amanda could have been there to share a glasss!!!)   There was an incredibly drunken guy sitting at the bar who was loud and obnoxious. It took a little too long for the bartender to kick him out.   As Gabi mentioned in her review, the bathrooms were pretty gross and certainly not maintained throughout the day.   As for food, I had the cheese and tomato sandwich on wheat with the potato fries. I was pleasantly surprised by my food and I really loved those little tasty fries. Yum!   Our server was able to accommodate all of us Yelpers pretty easily, although I ordered at the bar.   Overall Rula Bula is okay... but I certainly would never plan my evening around it."}
{"text":"The first thing I respect about Rula Bula is its ability to attract customers while keeping a low profile. No flashing lights, no 400 pound bouncers with angry stares, and no promotional cards being shoved in my face from down the street.  I walked in and liked what I saw. It has an old school feel to it. There was a live band doing some Lady Gaga covers, and it sounded like karaoke. I wasn't impressed, so I ordered my Jameson (reasonably priced) and walked out to the patio.  It was a good patio, with a DJ in the corner. It had a different feel to it, and I appreciate how laid back it was. But it felt like something was missing. I waltzed back inside, admired a much better cover (of Micheal Jackson) and realized the one thing I couldn't find here.   FUN.  To a west-sider like myself, Tempe is the Mecca of mischief, a place where I can have one too many and stumble back home with a story to tell. There was a dance floor, but no one was dancing. There were tons of people, but every group kept to themselves. Even though I don't go to bars to meet women, there was a suspicious lack of pretty ones in here. It's like everyone who was too old or uncool to go elsewhere came to have a Guinness in peace.  I came here expecting a fun bar that wasn't a full-blown club, and instead of getting a happy medium I ended up with a boring dive. Don't get me wrong, I fucking LOVE dive bars, but I don't go to Mill Ave for them. Rula is a good place with good history. I can't hate on it. I love the interior, and I could see myself coming back during the day. It's just not worth going out of my way on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Walking in, it has a very Irish feel. It is like walking into a pub in Europe. Very authentic and has the best Guinness in Arizona. The owner came out to talk to me about his Guinness tap and is very knowledgeable about the beer.  The fish and chips are delicious and so is their apple crumble. Their other beer selections are awesome and are reasonably priced. The outdoor patio is perfect for night life and on weekends they have live music!"}
{"text":"They have Lagunitas IPA on tap. So  yeah, there's your 4 stars right there.  On top of that they are on my bike route home from school... so convenient. Super plus, my bartender kept my drink full and get this, didn't ignore me.  She was funny, and friendly, and really made my day. So yeah, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Odd Happy Hour. Terrible food.  The only time in my life I've ever seen a group order chicken wings and not finish them.  I mean, that's saying something isn't it?    Two stars because they have Guinness on tap and it's a convenient location so I always seem to end up there when I am in Tempe, even though it's not very good.  Note to self: beer only next time."}
{"text":"We dined here for the first time on Monday Aug.18th about 7:00 PM. We met some friends who happened upon this gem a few years ago and highly recommended it. The place was busy, nice bar area up front and the dinning section is located further back. The menu is all Irish type meals. Something I'm very familiar with growing up having these dishes and being half Irish. So much to choose from and had a hard time deciding. Menu has so much to offer: including all the staples of a home cooked Irish traditional meal! Started with a great appetizer : seasoned potato balls that are deep fried & served with ranch and buffalo sauce- YUM!! The potato nacho's are gigantic and should be eaten as a meal. Serves at least 3-4 people! I had the corn beef sandwich and requested it wrap in a flour tortilla, it was delicious. My husband had a burger that came with bacon and a fried egg on top. One of the best burgers he has ever had! He ordered a few pairings of beers along with that, that went well & he enjoyed! You won't leave hungry with their portions. I feel a little expensive, but with the amount of food, presentation & atmosphere- well worth it. You have to try this place- amazing! Owner stopped by our table and inquired about our meal. Pleasant, friendly and told us some history of the restaurant. It's also indicated on their menu that the building was actually put together in Ireland and brought to the U.S. That's pretty cool! Truly an original..  BTW- if it's on the weekend or during any college event. You may want to go earlier as the night life and bar gets packed and it's a different crowd."}
{"text":"Superb quality food and customer service! Great teamwork among the staff. A pleasurable atmosphere. The fish and chips are some of the finest on our continent and competes with authentic British. Ian and Steve have the establishment's best interest in heart and is constantly situationally aware of her customers' needs!"}
{"text":"Finally, a place that has fish and chips worth mentioning!  Great ambiance for corporate lunch meetings to late night hang out.  Love the outdoor seating area and bar."}
{"text":"I stumbled in her for dinner one night and brought an out of town guest, the service was incredible and the food was good but if you are looking for upper scale steer clear... My husband and I have since been back... once again, good service... good food...   This is where I first met Shawn Johnson who is an amazing musician, I will go back..   LOVE the back patio with a bar and smoking available..."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to RulaBula for a while for lunch thinking it was pretty expensive and while its not cheap, they seem to have organized their menu a bit better for lunch time.  We were able to get in today without a wait even though there was a street fair of some type going on right in front of the place on Mill ave.  I had the special which was an open face pot roast sandwich which was very filling for $9.25.  I have always enjoyed my lunches there and will definitely go again."}
{"text":"This pub is on the end off Mill... So for those who can make it past all the bars through the block lies this gem. It's signifigantly less crowded than any other bar on Mill, serves my favorite beer (Magners), has a huge outside patio for socializing however still has local bands play inside some nights. Very chill place, absolutely love it."}
{"text":"The last time we (me and my drinkin' buddy) were here, it was: - Spring break - In a college town - During March Madness - During Spring Training - On...  St. Patrick's Day.  Talk about quintuple witching hour.  Oh myfuckinggoditwasoffthehook.   We walked in at 7:30 p.m. after moving hotels from a tragedy to something nice. 7:30 p.m. remember. There were people there drinking since 10 a.m., and looked every bit of it.  Yeah, the service sucked. The service has always sucked here.  But they have a great drink menu (come on, it's an Irish pub), the food is top notch, as talked about by the guy who's my friend and his parents are from England, and he knows something about fish and chips. Not the crappy fish and chips that most \"English\" pubs have, but the flaky kind this place and real English pubs do.  The sheperd's pie is also top notch, and so is the stew. Every time I've been here, they've had some band, sometimes it's too loud, but it's all part of the fun."}
{"text":"On wed nights they have trivia at 830. Trivia was fun. Many questions were from earlier than 1980s which was not fun and very challenging, lol. The food was great. I ordered an artichoke and spinach dip and guinness wings. They were very good. I also ordered the dirty Scotsman which is half Guinness and half kilt lifter. My friend ordered some chips, which are like really good flat potato wedges, but we never got them. The waitress forgot. And she didn't even come back so we can even tell her that she forgot them. The next time she came, it was to give us a box for the food. I.e, we were done eating.   Usually at trivia night I would have 3-4 beers but only had one because the waitress rarely checked on us, so how can I order more? Our waters weren't refilled either.  To sum up, 5 stars for the food, 1 star for the service and experience. :/"}
{"text":"Oh Rula Bula, we have so many good foggy memories together. I can't believe I just discovered you have happy hour!   The bartenders were super friendly. Definitely the kind of place you could come alone and not feel lonely.  Drinks during happy hour are $3 for a pint, or $1 off 20 oz drafts, wells, and house wine. After HH, drinks can get a little pricier. Foodwise, $8 got us  sliders, sweet potato fries with a tasty spicy ketchup, and the Hot Bollix Spicy Potato Balls- deep fried mashed potatoes with bacon, scallions, and Irish cheddar. How can you not like fried balls of potatoes and cheese?  I will cheers to that!"}
{"text":"We went to Rula Bula after a vacation to Ireland and wanted to try Irish food at home. The food was great. As an apetizer we had potato skins made with Irish bacon- best ever.  Also, their potato balls were something different and great. However, I made a bad decision and had their Moscow Mule. The flavor was great but I think the bar tender forgot to put in the vodka. I tried a second one and found it also lacked vodka. Maybe the bartender drank the vodka?"}
{"text":"3 and a 1/2 stars.  The extra little bit is for the fish and chips, which is extremely delightful and tasty, especially when you are ditching class and drinking beer along with it.   But the lacking stars are for the service.  The slooooooooooow service.  From bartenders to servers, you will get your pints and food at a turtle's pace.    If you go on St. Patty's day (it's comin' up) be prepared to be packed in like little sardines because the place gets BUSY.  As does any other Irish joint, but if you want to breathe, the only place that might be possible is on the patio.  Otherwise, good luck moving in the bar and even more good luck trying to get a drink!  I wouldn't rula this place out (get it?) but I'm not so sure I'd become a regular either."}
{"text":"Order the Oatmeal Cookie, even though it's not baked in an oven.  And probably doesn't have oatmeal's heart-healthy effects."}
{"text":"I come here one to two times a week with my boyfriend on his lunch break. They always have fast service and delicious food. The \"lighter fare\" of rosemary chicken and potatoes always makes me happy. Never tried anything else except a few bites of my boyfriends choice hamburger. The latest one he has liked has cream cheese and jalapeños I think? Very good, but so spicy that it burned my mouth. Yum! I enjoy this place immensely."}
{"text":"I admit, I like this place. In a town like Boston, or NYC, this would be 2 stars, but in Phoenix, it's one of the few Irish pubs you can go to, that is somewhat authentic (authentic meaning Guinness owns these, and Guinness is made in Ireland, so hence this is an Irish pub) .   It feels like home, from the Boston bartenders, to the Red Sox fans that seem to flock there. The prices are good, the food is surprisingly good, and they have a great staff. They have live music on the weekends, with a small cover, and bartender selected music the other nights( which can be terrible, depending on who is spinning). The patio is really quaint and secluded from Mill St.  When it's not hots as nuts out most people hang out here. They do have misters, so don't wear your glasses outside if it's misty season. My only problem, is one of location. Mill St. for the post college folk, can be annoying. You have a lot of options in the terms of bars, but this is one of the few worth going into. It seems to attract and older crowd, and  the ASU students that are mature and just looking to chill. It's mellow and not college-y at all. (new word) If you like the Irish Pub feeling, this place is rather cool."}
{"text":"Hands down the best bar in Tempe.  Live music on the weekends, great food with a hat tip towards authenticity, a fun laid back feel, large open patio and outside bar.  Rula Bula manages to pull off the often difficult balance between great daytime eatery and fantastic late night watering hole."}
{"text":"It was all good. We stopped after the PF Chang Marathon for some real refreshments and fuel. We were seated first available inside. They accommodated our group of 6 very quickly. The drink order was taken and filled quickly. We ordered our meals and they came in a timely manner as well. The BLT Salad was very good, basic, but fresh and plentiful. The Turkey Wrap was very yummy with a wonderful sauce. The Sweet Potato Fries we received were stone cold. Our waitress brought us some piping hot replacements in no time. The Chicken Sandwich was yummy. One of us ordered the Fish and Chips...the fish was also stone cold. We did not know this until later that night, as our friend never sends his food back, and will not complain. I heard this and was pissed! I would have had that taken care of on the spot. Plus we sent the fries back and he knew that. Oh well. The patio is awesome and it is always crowded."}
{"text":"The food here is actually pretty good, the bartender we had a few nights ago made an amazing old fashioned for me! I gave it three stars because we came back here on a Saturday night and the security guard was extremely rude to my boyfriend. My boyfriend is from Ireland so for obvious reasons we wanted to come back. The security guard had the audacity to ask him what his visa status was before even letting us in. WHO DOES THAT?! My boyfriend was extremely offended so we just didn't even bother going in. Management and the owner might want to think about retraining their staff."}
{"text":"I went here during lunchtime on a weekday and there weren't too many people. I was scared that the food might just be typical bar food but there was so much more to choose from! They even had vegan options, which came as a surprise!   I ended up with the special of the day which was a salmon salad. It was pretty good but there was an overwhelming amount of onions! Salmon was really tasty though!   The pub itself was really cool. I loved the architecture and the atmosphere and would love to go back in the evening for a few drinks! It's seems like a great place for groups and happy hour!"}
{"text":"Rula Bula!  No, I'm not speaking Caveman, I'm talking about the coolest spot to hang on Mill Ave.  The outside looks unassuming with the yellow and white. Once you walk in, it looks like a quaint little restaurant. Until you step outside into the back patio. Then the true Rula Bula experience begins!  The back patio has a full bar that curves around back to the right. The patio is filled with tables and chairs that are filled with a wide variety of people, from the young, hot co-eds that go to ASU to the 9-to-5ers who are stopping in after work to the older-yet-hip crowd that still likes to get together in their 40s and 50s.   The greatest thing about this place is that even though it is busy, it's not impossible to get a drink at the bar. As long as you take care of your bartenders and be respectful, they'll come back and take care of all your drink needs.  Needless to say, we all left quite happy.  Definitely one of my stops when I come back to AZ!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday after 11pm.  They charge cover after 10pm I believe (after a certain time).  But it was only $2, so not bad.  The front door guy who checks ID can be strict.  Not sure if he was messin around but he made me smile so he can see if my lilps matched my lips in the picture.  It was a good way to check an ID that's for sure, but geez, really?  Anyway, we hung out in the back outside.  They had mists on because it was so hot.  I sat in a spot where the mist was dripping.  I guess it was a good thing because I didn't feel much from the mist.  We hungout here for a bit til more friends met up with us.  Our waiter/bartender was good, fast too.  Music played was good.  Drink prices were decent.  I don't know the price but I just know we ordered a lot of drinks and it didn't come up too expensive like at clubs...that's all I can say for now."}
{"text":"Used to go to Arizona State and this is where we ended every night out.  Hard to find nicer bouncers and bartenders at any bar on Mill.  Great prices on car bombs and Guinness and a great late night menu also.  Good place to go to get away from the club vibe of a lot of Mill bars and just hang out and catch some live music  Atmosphere is awesome, definitely a place I'll be going back to every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This is an amazing Irish pub, one of the best Rubens that I have had. Highly recommend the cream beer!!!"}
{"text":"We love Rula Bula!  We have such nice evening there Friday night! We had just arrived from California to Tempe to visit our son.  We sat in the patio under the misters and so enjoyed the fabulous food, comfortable climate and the best waitress and service ever!  It's a regular spot for us and is super fun!"}
{"text":"Boxty, boxty, boxty.   How tasty and wonderful yet simple... It's just a thick potato pancake wrapped around some scrumptious filling like guinness braised beef or broccoli and cheddar. This is my uncle's favorite place to eat when he's in town (he's VERY PICKY and likes simple stuff and not too many veggies), and every time I bring someone there they really enjoy it. I love the cozy pub feel on the inside, and if it's a nice day it's great to have outside seating as an option too."}
{"text":"I've never been one to hit up the Mill bar scene. At nearly thir....at my age, I just assumed it was all going to be the obnoxious college crowds everywhere.  Rula Bula was definitely not what I expected at all! Thankfully! It was fun, low key, laid back. The place is cute, the crowd was mixed, the drinks came fast and the staff was friendly. We came too late to try the food and being that only one of us ordered a mixed drink, I can't justify giving it 5 stars based on beer and service alone. I will be back to try the food and update then. I predict a 5 star rating in the future."}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked forever on the suggestion of a stranger. Finally made it here and oh wow so very good.  I had the fish and chips which was really good. The fish had this amazing crisp batter and cooked to perfection. The potato wedges were cooked crisp and crunchy. The slaw was really good and not every slaw is made equally. I absolutely loved my meal and the Irish atmosphere  The wait staff was very attentive and friendly. It's my turn to say if you haven't tried the Rula Bula bookmark it and definitely give it a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"One of the best little pubs in Tempe, friendly, not rowdy, not a meat rack, just good people and good spirits!"}
{"text":"A bug group of came in after the bike fest on sat, was very busy we sat in the corner area the bartender was very attentive and we had several of there appetizers all were very good . Plus they have a huge selection if draft beer.We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Always a great time to be had at Rula Bula, good pub grub, great ales and good happy hour.  We spent a lovely Saturday afternoon/evening on the patio last weekend and got to listen to live music too.  Wonderful way to spend an afternoon.  I will be back :)"}
{"text":"The food was good as usual. Get the Shepard's Pie with carrots. Wash it down with a glass of cider. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"The only time I venture out onto Mill Ave is to come here for trivia on weds.  I try to avoid Mill Ave because parking is stressful.  There are very few spots to park for free.  You most likely will have to pay to park, even after 6pm. So far, I've had the potato leek soup, chicken pot pie and the fish and chips, all of which were amazing!! The fish and chips are probably the best I've had, and I've lived in Florida for 4 years where fish is their thang. The only thing I don't particularly like about Rula Bula, is that if you come in a large group, they won't split the bill.  I always feel like I over pay when I am forced to pay this way."}
{"text":"Rula Bula has some really great pros but they are outweighed by one major con. The patio is awesome, the music is not too loud so its great to go with a group and hang out and have a conversation while drinking, I love it. I also think their prices are reasonable and the selection of beer and whiskey is good too. My major point of contention is having to pay cover, yes I know the last time I went I only had to fork over two dollars, but that just makes me ask \"why two dollars? do they really need to shake me down for the extra few bucks?\" I hate paying cover to frequent an establishment Here is an idea, why dont I start a restaurant and just to walk in the door I charge 10 bucks. Ohhhh?? Thats crazy you say? Then bars need to stop this insane practice. (exception is bars doing a crazy drink special like penny bladder busters or a band is playing, a real band, I am not referring to the mediocrity I have seen at rula bula in the past)"}
{"text":"Great service, incredible setting, and currently loving my beer. The shepherd's pie is everything I needed in my life."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Great beer and great environment.   It has gone extremely downhill over the past couple years...   The bartenders used to be awesome and personable. My past 4-5 times they have been so rude I've left after one drink. I'm 27, not a college kid and act responsibly - treating people without respect and rudely will make you lose customers like myself.   I was willing to pay your higher prices for better beers and cocktails, now I will no longer be going there. I gave you many chances..."}
{"text":"Great pub. Food was good and a good selection of beer. Nothing was amazing, but if you like the pub style establishments, this is a great spot."}
{"text":"Come for the food, stay for the trivia on Wednesdays!"}
{"text":"..went in here on a weekday afternoon..no one hardly in the place..I don't understand what people rave about this place being so Irish..it looks a DisneyWorld version of an Irish bar..fake wood and everything is too new looking to look authentic Irish..go to Seamus McCaffrey's in Phoenix to see authentic Irish..anyway..I ordered the Irish potato skins ($9)..I'm sitting there wondering where they are after 10 min, 15 min...finally the bartender brings them out on a tiny little plate..2 potato skins!..and they're barely warm!  I walked out w/o paying.."}
{"text":"Let me start by clarifying that my five stars are for lunch on Mill. Rula Bula is a bit of a sleeper lunch place: if you've gone at night when school's in, it is very clearly a \"get crunked\" frat boy crazy kind of bar. So it will come as a damn good shock to you when you go during the light of day and enjoy a nice, relaxing lunch.  The fish and chips here are delicious. Beer-battered, thick and hearty, and real fish, served with a great tartar sauce and their awesome \"chips\"--lightly fried, thick potato slices.  Their boxty is a whole different story, but it's packed with flavor and incredibly hearty. Their salads are huge and everything is made up fresh, and you can tell they take pride in cranking out a really great lunch and catching you off guard. They're like a better Robbie Fox's, but they were here long before, and it's not hard to see why they've done so well.  Their patio is fantastic, the help is on top of things, the food comes quick, and everything is absolutely delicious and beautifully homemade, not just frozen, Sysco, dropped in the fryer, like so many pubs and bars. It matters and the price is right and it's WELL worth it to try this place for a great lunch.  My only complaint is that a few of the authentic Irish tables inside are too low for my legs to fit underneath, so I do well to avoid them for lunch. Otherwise, I'm always happy here for lunch."}
{"text":"Being on Mill Ave intrinsically puts Rula in a negative light..... despite its stereotype-ridden location consisting of the frat boy, psuedo hipster, loud and brash crowd, Rula is a nice little bar/restaurant and one of my first choices if I need to be on Mill Ave.   Always and forever my favorite thing will be the cute/quaint (yes its possible to use those adjectives for a Mill Ave bar) outdoor patio in back.  Its really quite lovely with lighted trees and a semi-private location.  There is a full/large bar outdoors too in addition to all the dining tables.    *Spicy potato balls and the chicken sandwich are really great... everyone always raves about their food and I can't disagree*    the happy hour is lacking... no happy hour food items and the drink discounts are so so.  I tend to be more of an 'atmosphere' girl so despite the disappointing happy hour I will go back to Rula for its environment ... especially over Robby Fox's and other lacking Mill Ave bars."}
{"text":"I had wanted to go there for quite some time and today it happened.  My expectations were very high and I was let down.  Their award winning fish and chips was average at best.  Price-wise the menu selections were reasonable.  Portions seemed adequate.  Service was fine and the outdoor patio was nice.  But the food was just me-too average.  No reason to return with so many other eateries close by."}
{"text":"This is my default happy hour/bar in Tempe. Prices are good and food is better, but it can be expensive outside of happy hour.  There is a wide selection of food and beverages on happy hour. Really, you can't miss on this one. BEWARE: Even though happy hour is 7 days a week, it is not available during special events, game days or for whatever random reason they feel. This part always makes me, a loyal regular, kind of pissy, but oh well. It has yet to deter me from going.  Every now and then, they have specialty dinners (single malt dinners, whisky dinners, etc.) that are quite awesome! Definitely be on the look out for posters in the bar and go to one. It's definitely worth the money and you'll be happy.  PS...they might have my single favorite bar food item...Hot Bollix. They are glorious, fried balls of deliciousness. Get some...NOW!"}
{"text":"As an Irish lass thru and thru, the promise of a cool Irish pub to get some grub and frosty guiness was enticing...and it delivered!  The food was great, our server was excellent, and they were able to accomodate our group of about 15 walkins without blinking an eye on a saturday evening (bonus points for that).  Their patio is really nice, lots of flowers and greenery and high stone walls that make you feel like you're in more of a garden than just off Mill Ave.  Overall, great place to head with friends!"}
{"text":"The BEST fish and chips I've ever had. I keep looking for better and keep getting disappointed. Rula Bula has got it figured out!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit to the place. The last time I was here, i sat in the backyard patio (which was great) but this time, preferred sitting inside. The service was great both the times and the decor gives a nice touch to the experience. Being a vegetarian, the choices were very limited indeed for me. The Potato skins were good as starters and the Vegetarian Shepherd's Pie was nice too. The Guiness brownie and Apple Crumble made for great desserts. I dont drink so cant comment abt that but they do have an extensive selection of drinks. The bill came to about $73 for 5 people without the tip. All in all, a good place with great people at ur service."}
{"text":"This place never ceases to amaze me! The clam chowder is out of this world! Homemade, delicious no fishy taste. Order the Fish and Shrimp combo, you can't find better in the valley!"}
{"text":"Today was my second time coming here. I always like to start my reviews after my second visit incase the first wasn't as expected. Anywho, today, since it was so nice outside, my fiancé and I decided to sit out on their beautiful patio. It's the perfect size for large parties and still have room for other patrons to enjoy themselves. My fiancé ordered a beer called Smithwick's, highly recommended for those who love dark beer, but it's not as heavy as something like Guinness.   For the appetizer, we order the Hot Bollix, which is a creation of their own that is a combination of Irish Bacon, potatoes, Irish Cheddar Cheese, and a few other things, fried and served with hot sauce and ranch dressing.  OMG, they are addicting. For the main course, I opted for the Irish Dip and Swiss, which is like a French dip, but served with Swiss cheese instead. Pretty yummers. My fiancé ordered the Reuben, which was big enough to feed two people. Needless to say, we couldn't finish it.   I'm giving it four stars because the service could have been slightly better this time around. The server did not refill my drink (iced tea). Other than that, it was rather enjoyable."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar in Tempe.  The food and beer are always so tasty.   My wife and I go there to hear good local music and love it."}
{"text":"Old school pub in Tempe. I like the patio with lights and heaters. It is the last bar on that side of the road so cool views of Mission Palms Hotel and Hayden Butte \"A\" mountain. The fish and chips are bomb. Good happy hour food prices."}
{"text":"The food is too overpriced for what you get. I've never been to a bar/restaurant that let me down so much with their chicken strips. I mean really, how do you mess that up?? They weren't strips at all but more like nuggets and way over cooked. For $8.50, it was incredibly disappointing.  I observed other dishes my friends ordered and their food wasn't appealing either. I think I'll stick to drinks only from now on."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great service. Food always hits the spot when your need some irish pub classics."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night.....The food and service was fantastic! Staff is super attentive, and Josette made sure we had everything we needed. We ordered the fish and chips and tried the Irish mule. No wait, fun energetic music and a quaint Irish feel. A+"}
{"text":"The menu says \"the best French toast you will ever eat\" and they did not disappoint.  Two thick fluffy slices of French toast - that appear to be deep fried - with powdered sugar and strawberries on top. Huge portion size so I wasn't able to finish it.  The Irish whiskey sauce was a little too alcoholic for me, but was still delicious, and my bacon was cooked a bit darker than I like, but that's personal preference.  The only bad thing is that I'm a UofA fan and the water glasses had the Sun Devil (ASU) logo on them."}
{"text":"This place was excellent!! The food was delish! I had the skirt steak salad and would order it again. The service was good, especially considering we had a group of 20.  The drinks were good, bartender knew what they were doing.   The place has a fun atmosphere to it.  I'll definatly be coming back next time I'm in Arizona."}
{"text":"Great alternative to all the rest of the lame Mill scene. Basically the only place on mill you should feel comfortable at past 9am if you're over 28. The Pyramid Country party was rockin tonight but it took too long to get a drink. They must've been understaffed. Anyway, thanks for not charging a cover. See you the next time I'm forced onto Mill and able to compromise."}
{"text":"I had this place bookmarked for over 3 years.  I finally went with a great group of Yelp-migos the Wednesday before St. Paddy's Day.   It was a beautiful night and our group of 13 (and a 1/2) sat outside on their lovely patio.  Our waiter was visibly overwhelmed and we all wondered how the heck he was going to fare the hordes on Friday (St. Patty's Day), if he couldn't handle our little group.   At the end of our evening, I saw him getting annoyed when several people asked for to-go boxes for our leftovers. This could've been rectified by him asking who needed boxes. Large parties typically have multiple ongoing conversations and seasoned servers know to do this to avoid the back and forth trips. Overall, the service was good and our server even went to extend our parking codes since it took a while to receive our food.  On to the food.  VEGAN REVIEW: I noticed that they have expanded their vegan menu and now offer Beyond Meat \"Chicken\" as an alternative for salads and wraps.  They offer vegan mayo, upon request (it's not listed on the menu, so just ask).    I ordered the San Patricio wrap and modified it to be vegan. I got the Beyond Meat \"chicken,\" spinach, avocado, vegan mayo, all wrapped in a spinach tortilla. It was pretty good, but they could season the Beyond Meat in order to give it more flavor.  The french fries were crispy and delicious! There's also a vegan Shepherd's Pie, made with red potatoes, that was really tasty.    Be advised that the veggie burger patty is NOT vegan and they have no vegan buns. You can get a lettuce wrap, tortilla, or flatbread, all of which are vegan.   Most side orders (kale, cabbage, etc.) can be modified to be vegan if you specify no meat, butter, cheese, etc.; sub olive oil.  I was informed that they will be doing Meatless Mondays and more vegan options if enough customers request it.   They offer patrons 2 hours of free parking in the adjacent parking lot; contact the restaurant for the code.  They also offer free wifi for customers."}
{"text":"We had the worst service from our server and the manager. Server never came back to get our order and we had to take our cups to the bar to get refills."}
{"text":"I'm going to be honest.  I was completely gone by the time I came here.  I really don't remember too much from this experience.  Although, the bill in pocket the next morning was no more than $13 which I think is a good sign.  Or a bad?  I seriously do not know.  This place was cool from what I can remember.  I think there was live music?  Yesss.  I love live music.  This place seemed pretty big as well and I really did like the outside area they have going on.  We were able to secure a table and enjoy our beer in the warm Arizona air.  Eventually, a waitress did take orders from us which was great.  This place was neat.  I think we stayed until close?  Pretty cool place to check out.  Would love to try the food here sometime!  Well, I'm going to end saying that although I cannot remember much from this Rula Bula experience, I did enjoy myself, and that is what is most important!  So GENIUS."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday along with few friends from work. The place was pretty empty, so we were seated immediately - probably it gets packed over weekends. I ordered the Corned beef & cabbage - and it was just so so. The beef had ok flavor but the veggies that came with it were just plain steamed or boiled.Overall  the dish was a bit of a let down. But my friends ordered the Beef Shepherd's pie and the Mac Attack and they enjoyed their dishes. So it seems like I probably ordered the  one of their mediocre items on the menu. Ambiance & service was decent - we were a group of 5 and we were in and out of the place in 1 hour. I plan on going back some day and trying out other items on their menu before I completely rule this place out. And yes - this place is conveniently located  next to a metered parking lot. Be sure to call this place before you go there to get a 2 hour free parking code - the code they have given in their online menu does not work."}
{"text":"We ordered the 'Mac Attack' burger and the 'Chicken and waffles'. The food was delicious. One of the best burgers I've had in a very long time. The beer was also good. Service was excellent. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"2hr free parking at ASU! That's five stars enough. I got the fish and chips and they looked great, tasted even better. Super moist. Spicy ketchup was great. I subbed sweet potato fries for Irish chips. I know, I'm that guy, sorry.   I sat at the bar. Food came out real quick. I'm satisfied."}
{"text":"I've been to Rula Bula about 50 times and it's ok. But the last dozen times I've gone it was really lame, varying from the crowd, to the speed/quality of service, to the bouncers. I've never eaten here but everyone seems to like it. The most recent visit, I went 2-3 weeks ago on a Friday night and the bouncers checked my friend's ID. He gets asked how many beers he expected to have, he answered and they denied entry. Which is funny because my friend is 35-36, so the GenY \"bouncer\" was still a zygote when this dude first started pounding beers. And that's the last time I went to Rula Bula.   The fact is Tempe is just no longer that cool. It's just another Phoenix suburb with the same douchebag meatheads and plastic sorostitutes as Scottsdale. Oh, speaking of which, the girl-guy ratio here is fucking terrible (if you're a straight dude). Bottom line, come here if you want to pay 5 bucks for a Blue Moon and say, \"I'm drinking in an Irish Bar!\" Otherwise, you can pay 30% less and get the same drinking experience across the street at Tavern."}
{"text":"Here is the skinny, Rula is on Mill, north of University, and this is the first problem.  The majority of this crowd is the plastic hat wearing, acoustic guitar maiming, frat boy we've all come to know and love OR the skinny jean squeezing, ironic mustache wearing hipster.  But my grand pappie always said \"It takes all types to keep us spinning\" so I keep going back.  Why? The food (by and large) is awesome.  Don't get the bangers and mash unless you don't mind kind of mushy bangers (i prefer mine with a bit more snap).  Shepherd's pie, Boxty, and a few other items I've had are great. Beer is good, good with food, I ate and drank so much I almost pooed.  Yeah, they have beer.  So don't a lot of places.  The back patio is great if you are a smoker (I am).  The music out there is hit or miss but the bar tenders, bussers and a few regulars back there are worth it.  Live music on occasion is alright and the trivia night was really fun the night I went."}
{"text":"Good late night food spot with good food not just greasy fried late night food but a nice menu selection.  I had the chicken flatbread .. delicious! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've had a few good times at Rula Bula and the food was usually pretty good. However, the last time I ate there the potatoes in my stew were very bitter, which means they were too old and too high in that chemical that forms when potatoes are too old, creating a bitter taste and gut aches. They left an awful aftertaste. When we were leaving I told the food server that the potatoes were too old so they were disgustingly bitter and she said, \"Really?\" That was it; lousy customer service in response to a complaint of bad food because the kitchen used ingredients that should have been thrown out.  I haven't eaten there since."}
{"text":"Five-star Fish N' Chips and Five-star Guinness pours.   Regarding all the love it/hate it review inconsistencies: this restaurant/bar is a chameleon of sorts. It's one color during the day and another at night. It's complicated even more so depending on whether school is in session or not. Lunch on a weekday in the summer yields friendly waitresses in a history-rich, inviting restaurant. Visit on a Friday or Saturday evening in the fall and you can expect a rushed/stressed wait staff and a packed house of loud, drink-loving college students. Each has their pros and cons, but the experience may be drastically different from one visit to the next."}
{"text":"Tucked away on the north side of 5th Street and Mill Avenue is the humbly delicious Rula Bula. We went here for a Friday night dinner and got their signature Shepherd's Pie (beef, potatoes, veggies) with a side of brussel sprouts and apples, and their fish and chips (cod, fries, comes with coleslaw and their homemade tartar sauce). The Shepherd's Pie was my favorite, and having savory apples was a first, but good, nonetheless. Their food was wonderful, to say the least, and they have a wide array of classic Irish food and a large mixed drinks section, so there's definitely something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Rula Bula is my favorite bar in Tempe.  The atmosphere is warm and inviting and the staff is absolutely fantastic.  On the weekends, they have live music inside sometimes including this awesome by-request cover band called Yoga Pants.  Everybody always has a fantastic time when these guys come around.  The outside patio is also a great place to hang out.  They have twinkling lights and space heaters and a newly renovated outside bar.  I have never had anything less than a great time at Rula Bula!"}
{"text":"Been here several times and always a pleasure coming back here. After running in the PF Chang's half marathon last Sunday, chose this as my post race meal and so worth it!! They have an excellent brunch menu and that was just what my tummy was in the mood for! Ordered the corned beef hash and poached eggs with the traditional Irish soda bread and believe me I was in post race meal bliss!! Extra kudos to the staff at Rula Bula since they had to deal with a ton of post race famished runners and yet remained super friendly and great service!! Try the Velvet Mimosa, Black Velvet and Champagne-super smooth and delish!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a beautiful Monday. The bartender said to sit anywhere INSIDE or OUT but when we sat at the outside bar, a waitress came up and said \"this bar is closed but there's one inside.\" We told her we wanted to sit outside because it's gorgeous out, and she took care of us anyways, but we felt like we were being a bother. Ordered ACE pear cider and they were out, got an apple ale cider instead. We had the fish and chips and it was awesome. Very fresh! Overall, I love the atmosphere and food of this place, so the little misunderstanding about what's open and closed won't keep me from going back."}
{"text":"Loved the food! The service was also really good! The waiter made great suggestions when we asked and was knowledgeable and very helpful! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"\"The mouth of a perfectly happy man is filled with beer.\" ? Egyptian Proverb.   Does this quote apply to those who drink Snake Bites?  Anywho!  Met up with some of my favorite Yelpers for a belated St. Paddy's Day lunch and it was great!  Rula Bula's is a cute little pub with fun Irish tunes and some delicious eats.  Their patio was looking pretty tempting on this beautiful Friday and the first day of Spring but we dined indoors.  To start things off, Gillian ordered and shared her Hot Bollix Spicy Potato Balls with us.  Thanks for sharing those heavy balls with us, girly!  I had assumed that the spice would be present inside the deep-fried cheesy potato balls but the spice came from the hot sauce served on the side.  It was kind of nice since weaklings like me can adjust accordingly.  I had a picture but I stupidly deleted it before I posted it.  Gah!  As for my entree, I ordered the Shepherd's Pie with my side of brussel sprouts with apples.  It was delicious, buttery, and worth the calories.  The brussel sprouts were cooked to tender perfection and I loved the bite from the apples.  I actually didn't know the brussel sprouts came with apples until I bit into one.  Yum!  That tartness really helped cut through all that richness from the potatoes and meat.  I would definitely order this again!  \"For each petal on the shamrock this brings a wish your way. Good health, good luck, and happiness for today and every day.\"  Thanks for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"We sat outside and frankly it smelled bad. Possibly bleaching the \"deck\" would help. The food was good and the server was friendly but seemed a bit overwhelmed. I may try it again and sit inside."}
{"text":"Cool bar with cool staff. And they have Kilkenny on draft!! Good place to go grab a beer for happy hour or a nice scotch with some buddies. They have tons of whiskey/scotch to choose from."}
{"text":"There's not much more I can say about Rula that hasn't already been said. Except, I guess, I can tell you why I like this place. I like it for two glorious words: HAPPY + HOUR.   Yes, those two words matters so much to me. Rula offers 1/2 off all appetizers and discounts on pints. What could be better? I say try the brie, for it comes with an unbelievable apple chutney. If you're looking to split an entree with a friend, opt for the lamb stew - served with a side of soda bread. The stew is hearty and the serving is huge. I've also had the shepherd's pie, which was pretty tasty. Way too large for one person, though.   Also, I discovered that Rula can make ya a Raspberry or Chocolate Guinness. I don't know how either tastes, for I went with a plain (but satisfying) pint. I asked to sample the concoctions, but was told Rula doesn't let people sample liquors. Fair enough.   If I could change one thing about this place (ok, maybe more than one thing), I'd have a larger beer selection - even sold by the bottle. I'd also make it less noisy and crowded at night. If you don't get there early enough to stake your spot, you're likely to be standing the entire time. That doesn't make for a very comfortable experience. Word to wise: take advantage of Rula's casual atmosphere and leave your ridiculously high heels at home.  It's great that Rula offers live music. I wish they offered more. Sure, the outside patio is great, but what if I'm in the mood to play darts? I guess I'll have to go to another bar for that... and for the beer I'm really craving.  WORD TO NON-MEAT EATERS: Try their veggie burger thingy - with mushrooms, peppers and such all heaped between two soft and delicious pieces of bun. Yum. It comes served with fresh, crispy and DIVINE 'tator wedges. These ain't your normal french fries, people. I STILL have cravings for them!  Rula Bula's food deserves 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how it is that I've never been to Rula Bula.  Of course, I don't spend much time on Mill.   Friends suggested Rula Bula for drinks and snacks tonight.  I arrived to a completely dead place at 4 p.m.  I found my buddies on the large back patio.  The patio is great and so was the weather today.  Service was a little sketchy, but nothing major.  We did have to change tables after we got pooped on four times by the birds in the tree up above.    Happy hour on Sundays if from 4 to close.  $1 off drafts and well drinks.  Then the server announced that all apps were half price.  Not sure if that's a happy hour thing or not.    We had a few things to share.  Here are the results.  The lemon shrimp app was pretty good -- a cold shrimp dish, which we weren't expecting since it didn't say that on the menu.  And the smoked salmon plate with cukes, onions and capers.  A steal for $4!  The salmon was good and went well with the soda bread.  We also shared a Shepherd's Pie.  The meat was good and it wasn't too greasy or running.  Just right!  I'll be back to try more tasty offerings.  Slainte!"}
{"text":"Lunch time in Tempe with some co-workers.  The menu is long and you can get overwhelmed with the choices.  When this happens, you let the locals pick for you.  I was not disappointed at first cause it was good.  After 1500 calories later is when I regretted it.  Started with buffalo wings.  4 out of 5.  Could have used a spicier kick.  Then got the grilled macaroni cheese with bacon.  4 out of 5."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the most \"authentic\" Irish pubs in the phoenix area. The others don't look like an Irish pub, have very very poor beer selections, and lack a substantive Irish demography inside from both staff and patrons. Rula Bula defies most of these downfalls of Phoenix area Irish pubs.  Whether or not this pub was disassembled and shipped here I'm not sure, but it looks just like the other pubs claiming this accomplishment. Authentic menu selections round out the place nicely, though on the pricey side for both food and beverage.  Staff could be more polite, even if the patrons are not Irish (as I am not). Just not a comfortable, inviting feel to me. College yuppie clientele seem common.  Beer selection is a typical limited selection of British and Irish imports. Nothing special. If you must have an Irish pub and you're in Tempe then this is your place. If not, there are other places of interest to the beer enthusiast in Tempe."}
{"text":"Im not going to sit down and write out the whole story again as yelp deletes your review if you answer your phone. The manager Chris refused to allow me to have a few beers with a friend inside of the bar because i had my certified service dog with me. As a disabled Iraq war veteran and my border collie goes with me everywhere. He disregarded the ADA and told me they would only allow me to finish my beer (i already paid for by the way) on the back patio. I had nothing to drink prior to this, i wasn't being unreasonable, my dog was being well behaved as she is trained to always be, and Chris is just a dickhead. Shame on you Rula Bula for your disdain towards certified service dog's or the disabled combat veterans who need them!"}
{"text":"I am such a sucker for a hidden gem! Rula Bula is definitely that. I have passed by here several times to go to the disgusting clubs like el hefe and cue Club. I'm Getting older and starting to appreciate smaller more quaint bars so I was really impressed with this place. There is a back patio that is somewhat hidden, and very enjoyable. Their Irish car bombs were on point, and our bar tender was excellent. I fell in love with this place and came back with 5 friends who had never been, and now it's safe to say they are just as in love! :)"}
{"text":"Ah, this is good stuff!  First off, they have free two-hour parking behind the joint, so plan your trip carefully.  Second, enjoy!  I'm a former native and I'm back in town with a friend who is also a former local, and he tells me there's this great fish 'n' chips place in Tempe, but he couldn't find it over the weekend.  So yesterday we're out and about and were going to go to Ted's, THE BEST PLACE in town for hotdogs, when we decided to look for this place.  Dave remembered something close to the name and it was close enough, and here we ended up.  Decor: very nice.  I can't say it struck me as authentic Irish so much as old American antiquish, but that's OK.  Drinks: I had iced tea, which was fine.  Dave had a whiskey which apparently he quite liked.  Food: very good.  We both had fish and chips, and we both liked it.  I was ambivalent about the \"Irish\" potatoes, as they simply seemed sliced at about a quarter inch and pan fried, but they were OK.  The fish was very good, nicely golden brown, and the tartar sauce was sufficient in quantity.  The coleslaw didn't do anything for me, but Dave finished his.  But what's going to bring me back is the rest of the menu.  I like George and Dragon in Phoenix, but I prefer to go there with either my wife or my oldest friend, and neither are in town, I don't like going there alone.  Thursday Dave and I and another friend are going to a movie at the Valley Art, and I'll get a chance to go a bit further afield on the menu, something that I'm really looking forward to.  And I heartily recommend the Hot Bollix Spicy Potato Balls as an appetizer.  They're quite yummy, they also have a little bit of heat, so if you're sensitive to heat bite in to one first before dipping in the buffalo sauce.   One complaint: for a Monday post-lunch meal, they were really slow getting our meals out to us.  They were less than a quarter full in the dining room and I'm sure had a few out on the back patio, I'm not sure why it took so long.  It wasn't a problem as Dave and I weren't on a schedule and were just gabbing, still, it was a little strange.  I'll definitely bring my wife here when we're in town together."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great outdoor patio!! Really good clam chowder. Saturday and Sunday morning brunch from 10am to 2pm"}
{"text":"On our way to see the Luminaries at the Botanical gardens.  We were with friends that had eaten at this place before and they knew some of the history.  We were there early so getting a seat was easy.  Our friend told us the flooring, tables, windows and decorations came from a bar in Ireland. Knowing this made the experience more enjoyable.  We had a good meal with everyone enjoying their meal and eating more than we should. Prices were reasonable and the quantity of food was sufficient.  This would be a place to take pictures when the sun is shining through the stain glass windows,  I would definitely go back to eat there if I am in the area."}
{"text":"It's a fun Irish pub/restaurant.  The food is decent.  Nothing to write home about.  It's on Mill Ave so you can expect a college crowd.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Mwah!  Had a wonderful dinner tonight.   I ordered the Bangers and Mash this time.  Nice presentation, and very tasty.  I especially enjoyed the mashed potatoes and gravy with this dish.  Creamy potatoes and perfectly seasoned gravy.  I highly recommend Rula Bula to everyone, in search of a unique dinning experience. They offer great Irish and English dishes. Jennie, our waitress, was so courteous and kind! What a fantastic way to end the week! Ask for Jennie when you visit Rula Bula! Thanks Guyz, and of course we will be back again.  Also, ask any of the staff about the history of the building.  You will be AMAZED!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"umm yea. there is nothing all that great about the Rula  i was here with my BFF (yea like a teenage girl, lol) cause we was bored and figured get out of the spot.  we took the train up to mill already half toasted on a couple cans of Mickies in thirstbuster cups care of Circle K. (heart) circle K kay..! ya know.  anyways so walked up and down mill scoffing at the people looking to get fucked up. i blew up AmyD on the cell saying we would catch up with her at the sets or yucca tap room...  ended up walking back to the Rula and grabbed a couple drinks. umm. yea. this place isn't really great or anything.  just kinda like all the rest of the \"bars\" on mill. just irish stylized. i've been here plenty of times before and never thought to myself...\"wow what a great irish bar\". meh. it's kinda like a themed college bar and nothing more. oh well. grabbed a couple blue moons and bizounced. threw a middle finger to mill as we jumped on the \"trolly\" and busted ass back to PHX screaming \"602\""}
