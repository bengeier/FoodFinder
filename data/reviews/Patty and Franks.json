{"text":"Hubby and I have started 'Wednesday Night is Burger Night' . Tonight we went to Patty and Frank's and what a great choice!! We arrived about 6 pm to a bright, fresh and welcoming place. A couple waiting for their takeout to cookand a young family were our fellow diners. A great selection of eats are on the boards at the order counter - basic burger for $4.99 ( a frank is $3.99) that you customize yourself for a buck a throw (ie. cheeses, bacon, egg, etc) or various house creations, plus fries, poutine, onion rings, shakes and house ice cream sandwiches! I had the L'il Boy Blue (perfectly cooked bacon and creamy blue cheese) and fries, hubby had the Early Riser (peameal, fried egg and chipotle mayo) with onion rings and a choc shake. It was all top notch! Juicy, grilled tasting good size burgers, great home cut fries and crispy onion rings. The chipotle mayo had a nice tang and the shake was very good - chocolate-y and nicely thick. The place is very clean and the staff is prompt and friendly. You put in your order, have a seat and they bring it to your table. Our meal was $29, tax included. We threw out our trash in the big bins provided and handed the counter guy a tip on the way out because they earned it! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My girlfriend and I walked in for the first time out of curiosity and they treated me like Im a usual. The people there took their time to explain everything to me which is nice.  After I ordered the food, the cashier took an extra minute to make sure I get the lowest pricing combination possible.  Great hot dog and amazing Nacho Libre. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I just got back from this place and it was amazing. The food was rather good but the service was what sold me. We decided to go here on a whim for our date night and were VERY pleased. The service is what really sold this place for me. I wish we didn't have to tip at the start of the meal since it only got better the longer we were there. I never felt like anyone was watching me eat yet there were on the ball. I also really enjoyed that when they said REAL cheese, it was real cheese. Thank god for this place, I was really missing the Lick's but now I have a new go to place."}
{"text":"I'm the queen of those deal websites (buytopia, groupon), so after reading the yelp comment on this place, I rushed over there.  The first 2 times I went there, the place was closed (before the actual closing time).  The third time I went on a Tuesday night at around 8:30, not realizing they closed at 9pm.  The place was empty except for me and Danny, the front counter guy was really nice and acommodating, giving me suggestions that would get the most out of my coupon.  I got the Vanilla milkshake (effing delicious!!!), the  P&F Poutine (I took it as a take out and haven't eaten it yet), the texan hot dog (burst in your mouth and flavourful) and the Eh Oh Burger (had it the next day, lovely!!! Make sure to get it on brioche bread).  I've been an A&W gal (there's one up the street), but I will def. come back here more often, even if it is more expensive.  The food is that good."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  The food is delicious (I had a frank doused in tzatziki!) and their burgers are so so delicious.  The owner gave us a complimentary order of fries so we could try the recipe he created for vegetarian gravy. Amazing. I'll go here anytime I have a burger or hotdog craving, without a doubt!"}
{"text":"I really hate to do this because I really like the place. I wen't there the first week it opened up and ordered a burger for me and my girlfriend. I think we may have got combo's. Anyhow the total of that was $35. I could have gotten a great meal a couple doors down for that much.   The onion rings are also EXTREMELY oily... To the point where they were inedible.   The burger was good... but not worth that much exactly."}
{"text":"Patty and Franks has a great selection of burgers. their meat is great, and their fries generous and crispy. I have been there a few times and i will certainly be back for more."}
{"text":"Oh, patty and franks where do I begin? I guess with what I ate...  A frank, wrapped in bacon...with peanut butter and blueberry jam! Get it. It just works. Trust me.   It came to $16 for this heavenly thing as a combo (fries and drink) and then a bottle of beer too so not that badly priced for what we got. Fries were crisp and delicious.  The guy behind the counter was very helpful and accommodating to us sharing. He was friendly about giving advice on the menu and their signatures.  Try that frank, do it do it."}
{"text":"First impression, cozy friendly place,  the guy at grill who took my order was a nice dude, advisable with food, such a filling burger and not too messing.definitely will be back. More burgers to try."}
{"text":"The service deserves 10 stars.  Awesome staff ! Burger was great, fries really good and onion rings fantastic. Was super fast service and great quality."}
{"text":"Awesome place, fries are amazing. Super friendly owner and they stayed open for us. I would definitely come back, so many options for burgers and other stuff!"}
{"text":"Burger houses are popping up everywhere these days. Like this Greektown addition I just happened to stumbled upon. I will admit however that \"Patty and Frank's\" does not quite strike me as an ingenious business name, but whatever.  Pretty decent food and solid enthusiastic service. I'd imagine you could customize the hell out of your burger. The stock burgers are not huge, but are on the affordable side of gourmet takeout, enough to satisfy those who just want a decent good burger. And boy do the patties taste like they are fresh off a backyard barbeque grill. Can't speak of their hot dogs or poutines yet, but the fries are tender and huge. Good enough to make for a decent lunch.  Speaking of fries, I wasn't expecting that they threw in fries on the house with my single burger order, which I guess is what happens when you step inside looking for lunch at a takeout joint that you had no idea had just opened.  {TTC: a short walk to Logan from Chester subway station.}"}
{"text":"Good price and good service! Very friendly staff + the pf style hot dog was just amazing. I will return again one day to try the chilli dog."}
{"text":"Patty and Franks is a great place if u want fresh burgers/hot dogs or fries/onion rings. It's all made in house, never frozen and no preservatives. I was attracted by the bright red sign and was in the mood for a burger. I walked in and took a look at the drastic improvement in appearance from what it used to be when it was a run down Greek restaurant. I walked in and felt like I was right at home  I debated which burger would be my first kill. I tried the Northern Lights burger \"Home burger topped with lettuce, sautéed mushrooms, smokey BBQ sauce, real cheddar cheese, and crispy bacon\" and was instantly in love.  It was so juicy and flavourful and I knew I would be a regular. If you haven't had Patty & Franks then you have not lived yet!"}
{"text":"Excellent Blue Burger Stopped by Patty and Frank's Saturday night - we had a Groupon. One of the best hamburgers I've had in a long time - big, messy in a good way, and great kind service too.  7$ for a hamburger of this quality is more than fair.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"i didnt expect much but the food was very tasty, they gave me free fries and gravy, and it was one of the best service experiences i have ever had. The people who work there are so nice!"}
{"text":"This place is a great addition to the Danforth. The customer service was awesome... It really makes a difference eating at an establishment that appreciates the customer. I had the P&F frank and it was very flavourful. The portion sizes are large so go hungry. They're open late which is also a plus!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Friendly service. Fair prices. Patties start at $5 then each premium topping (cheese, sautéed somethings, etc.) is $1 each. The beef was delicious. I was gonna grab a gyro nearby but they weren't open before 12, but these guys were, so I thought I would try it out. Glad I did!   Something was a bit salty, maybe the blue cheese. Other than that I would say everything was spot on.   Very delicious. I just got a burger but I was full. The fries looked good but i couldn't do it. Maybe next time. Poutine sounds good. They make milkshakes, and they brought at least one boy to the yard because they were mixing one up when I was there.    I highly recommend checking out this place if you like burgers or are looking for something other than souvlaki, gyros and sushi on the Danforth."}
{"text":"This place rocks! The burgers are fresh and tasty and for the price, you won't be hungry after. I had the Patty's Peppercorn and man, did it pack a punch! Dijon-ranch sauce on top of lettuce, tomato, ONION RINGS and SWISS CHEESE! I was very surprised how the peppercorn crust turned out and man was it ever good. I got a combo and the lovely guy who owns the place asked me to try \"a new soup\" and it was AMAZING. Really want to try some of their other menu options.  A 24-hour A&W took over the old Lick's and It would be a grand shame if Patty & Franks doesn't get more business. Go in and try it THE REAL THING, you wont be disappointed."}
