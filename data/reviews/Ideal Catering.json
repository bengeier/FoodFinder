{"text":"I really like this food truck. Especially when I get the overly Canadian craving for traditional style poutine. 

The normal hotdogs here don't taste as good as hotdog stands, but they have good deals on the hotdogs and fries combos. 

I mainly just go here for the Supreme Canadian fries, which I can only stomach once every few months (delicious, but VERY oily. You can feel it clogging your arteries in ways, most fastfood restaurants can't.) And I also come here for the poutine. Always a pleasure."}
{"text":"No. Just no. I have bought their stuff ONCE and it was so bad that I did not risk another attempt, fearing for my health. I got their veggie dog with fries, something I always get at the blue food truck just down the road. I dressed everything, tucked in, and the veggie dog stank. Yeah. It smelled like feet and was probably 2 months past the expiration date. I threw that out right away, a little bothered that I didn't throw UP. I figured that I will have some fries, and initially I didn't taste anything wrong with them, because they were being dipped in ketchup, but I had one fry straight up and it was stale like it's been sitting there for days. I avoid this food truck even if I'm coming out of sid Smith and it's right there staring like a bad scent you can't shake. I walk down to the blue truck, get my food, and come back up to eat. 

Overall a disgusting experience,  never coming back because I value my health and want to live a fulfilling life."}
{"text":"russet potatoes
cheese curds
dark gravy

that is one incredible poutine.
so cheap.  even the small is much too large for one person. such a good deal.

pretty much everything you want in a dirty greasy meal."}
{"text":"This is a must try place. Absolutely amazing. This is the Toronto culture, the poutine the burger, the fries, all are amazing.

The portion is huge, feel how students eat during the exam nights and enjoy this memorable experience of being a UofT student."}
{"text":"For food trucks, this is as good as it gets. Mind you, there are a number of food trucks on the university campus but this is one that really stands out. To regular students, this truck is known as the 'anything to drink for you' truck as the friendly woman in the truck always asks that in an accent that stands out in memory. It also helps that it's in the middle of campus, stays open late (until 11:30 PM), and is across a student residence whose dinner hall closes at 7:30 PM.

As for the food, you have the selection of hotdogs, fries, and fries supreme which are the most popular among others. The poutine is the one that stands out the most as the portion and gravy is amazing and comes in three sizes with the smallest even being quite large. The prices are $4, $5, $6 for the sizes, respectively. The cheese curds are a bit big but I don't mind it. The gravy is dark, thick, and beefy and full of flavour. I usually get an Arizona drink too as they're cheaper here ($2) than the hotdog stand next to them."}
{"text":"My favourite poutine spot. Classic poutine with thick cut fries and the perfect amount of gravy and melty cheese curds. Super affordable, especially for the size. 

I paid $4 for a small and it was the perfect portion. A medium is only $5, and perfect for when you're extra hungry, trying to fill yourself, or sharing with a friend. The large is also only $6 too! 

It's my favourite poutine not only because of the value, but also because they keep it simple and classic. No embellishments and fancy toppings. Just a good simple traditional poutine.

Fast line. Kind service. Quality food truck. 100% would return."}
{"text":"2018 new year, new me
or more like new year, still broke
thanks to brown food truck me and my gf can split a med fries and be satiated for less than $3. well really, i always crave more cuz they're so damn good"}
{"text":"This truck is the best thing that's ever happened to me. The poutine is the perfect meal to cheer you up on a bad day."}
{"text":"After sampling quite a few other poutine places in Toronto, I've definitely figured out what's so different about Idea Catering's - their gravy. It's so ridiculously beefy; gravy in other places tends to be more mild and thicker. Ideal Catering's gravy hits you right in the face with its strong beef flavor.

Also, try the fries without the gravy! They are deliciously crispy and salty, perfect for a post studying midnight meal/snack.

Love this place. The lady who runs it is Turkish and just soooo nice."}
{"text":"Known as the \"Brown Food Truck\", or \"Anything to drink for you?\" truck situated in front of Sidney Smith, I come here for a cheat meal between classes every once in a while for their poutine.

The cheese curds are squeaky and melty, fries soft and fresh (I've never had a stale order ever), and the gravy just pulls it all together.

It's $4 for a small poutine, $5 for a medium, and ~$6 (?) for a large (never ordered a large before, I can hardly finish a medium).

If you get full easily I recommend getting the small because the potatoes really fill you up.

Convenient, cheap, and delicious."}
{"text":"Matt's Pick: Large Poutine, $5.25

You can't go wrong with any business whose motto is  \"Gravy Always Free\" . This chip truck on the U of T campus in front of the Sidney Smith building dishes out some seriously amazing poutine (S $3.75, M $4.50, L $5.25).

Order a large poutine and you'll get a dirty-big mound of fresh fries topped with a pile of cheese curds and slathered in gravy. Ideal Catering does things right by mixing the curds and gravy throughout the fries. This way you don't end up with dry fries at the bottom.

Sure, the fries could be a little crispier, the curds could be a little squeakier, and there's nothing gourmet about this poutine. It's just good old fashioned, simple deliciousness. Possibly the best poutine I've had in Toronto. There's no better fuel to get you through 3 hours of painfully boring evening lectures."}
{"text":"Found this food truck through a Yelp search for poutine -- good choice, y'all. Massive, massive portions with rich beefy gravy (as other folks have pointed out) and very squeaky curds. The small order is a good size for one person, but note that the medium order probably offers the most bang for your buck -- it's probably 2x as much as the small (it pretty much looks like the large and there was no way I could finish it). There's a line of 4+ students, but it moves fast!"}
{"text":"Everything from my first review stands but I'd like to add Ideal Catering has, what is in my opinion, better tasting gravy than the Blue Chip truck for the same price and with the same squeaky cheese curds and skin-on cripsy fries."}
{"text":"Got the supreme fries in medium for $5. Absolute value pick! So much food and toppings were relatively fresh. Absolute banker."}
