{"text":"This is my go-to for any meal honestly. I love how quick and easy everything is. The service can be strange to those who aren't used to Asian owned establishments. But I enjoy that there's no forced conversations and unnecessary check ups on us while we eat. So, service is straight to the point and quick!  The food though, is never disappointing for me. I choose to eat here for hang overs, for a quick lunch, and sometimes even just a quick spring roll snack.  I highly recommend! It's just delicious food with good service and the owner will always remember your face :)"}
{"text":"Great food and incredible service. Friendly caring and warm service. Pho is rich and balanced. The service!!"}
{"text":"So far I have only had pho tai chin and it was fantastic. I am glad to have found a great pho joint so close to me! Looking forward to trying the rest of the menu!  Edit: Awesome, absolutely great. I have gone many, many times for late breakfast or lunch and I am never disappointed. The waitstaff is very friendly and always on the spot for drink refills and advice on what to get! I cannot recommend enough!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite restaurants in Tempe! The service is great, always friendly, and the pho is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Meat portions were a tad on the small side but all and all we enjoyed it. Staff was super friendly and the place was clean! We are definately putting this on the list for dinner outtings. And theres options for kids! Cant wait to come back and try something else."}
{"text":"Solid Pho   Very good broth.  not the cheapest Pho but very good and consistent.   It is a very clean well ran restaurant.   The staff here is generally very friendly.    A favorite of our family"}
{"text":"This restaurant really lives up to its name by being (in my opinion) the best Vietnamese Pho restaurant in Arizona! I've been to a couple of other Pho joints in AZ that were either hit or miss, but this one sets the bar pretty high by balancing quality, flavors, cleanliness, and let's not forget, remarkably fast & friendly service!  I've been to numerous Pho restaurants over the last decade in both California (where I'm from originally) and Arizona to be able to decipher the difference between \"quality\" or lack-there-of. What sets Un-Pho-gettable apart is that they're able to achieve the level of deep flavor in their Pho broth without the use of MSG (which a lot of cheaper Pho joints do to compensate for lack of quality ingredients). I'm not going to knock MSG for being the bad guy, because I personally feel that a little doesn't hurt (it adds flavor). But let's face it, if you can create a good savory dish without it, I'm all for it. IMO, the use of MSG is like cheating (adding flavor to subpar food and sometimes disguising what they don't want you to taste).  The owner was kind enough to give us a little background on his restaurant and how they stand behind quality ingredients and how they choose better cuts of meat, take care in preparing the Pho broth (which when done right, takes a long time to infuse the flavors), and how this is all orchestrated without the use of MSG. Now, our assessment... As soon as our food came to the table and we had our first bite, my GF (who is Vietnamese by the way) agreed with me in delight that we found our new Pho spot in AZ! We were just too spoiled in LA, and just couldn't find the right spot to fill the void in AZ. But let me tell you, the broth was full bodied and robust (the way pho broth is supposed to be), the meat was tender and delicious, and the noodles were on point! We also had an order of egg rolls (Cha Gio) and compared to other places where I sampled this dish, you can tell the wrapper was top quality because of the crisp and texture. Sure the prices are a bit higher than some other Pho restaurants, but it is well worth it to know you are paying for good quality and Pho done right.   If you're looking to try Vietnamese Pho for the first time or you're (like us) just trying to find a new Pho restaurant, do yourself a favor and give them a try."}
{"text":"I ever tried Vietnamese or Pho before I ate here, and I was surprised how much I liked it. The food was tasty and the derive was good."}
{"text":"This is probably the best bun place in the valley.  It is attached to the asian market and less intimate and restarauntey, but the awesome food totally makes up for it.  The portions are HUGE as well!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite pho spot on the planet so far. Not like I get around the planet much or anything, but I grew up in the San Gabriel Valley area of Los Angeles, and had plenty of pho choices growing up and when I go home to visit. The broth is the most pleasant I have ever had, for those who know Golden Deli in California, I would even say unphogettable' broth is cleaner and more flavorful. I prefer my pho with rare steak, and always order the #13 with my steak on the side. The only thing I wish they had was more choices for steak, such as ribeye or even filet mignon. I'd pay the extra $$ for better quality cuts. I also appreciate that they've kept the prices so low throughout the years. Another thing I mist highlight is the prompt, friendly and accommodating service I receive every time without exception. Most servers know my wife and I's order by heart. Great experience always."}
{"text":"Quite simply, if you know Vietnamese food, you know this is great food.  If you don't know about it and want to learn, please go here and ask.  They will teach you about it- and you should try it.  I crave it now!  They have another restaurant in Virginia and have been restauranteur-ing for years.  A complete family operation and truly authentic and home cooked food.  Located in the Mekong Plaza next to the entrance to the supermarket. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So pho-cking good!  The best pho in Phoenix (not that that's hard) and the owners are totally awesome and helpful."}
{"text":"Okay. I know there are several places to try but this place by far is the best in the east valley for Pho. The staff are friendly & eager to please your appetite. The Pho Ga is our families favorite. I prefer my order with half vegatables & chicken. The broth alone is delicious if you don't like to add spicy hot sauce or sweet hoisin sauce. The staff also recommended the combonation fried rice. It is the best tasting fried rice I've had in a very long time. It has chunks of bbq pork ribs, chicken & a few shrimp which i don't mind because the balance works well together. The spring rolls are also a great appetizer w/ peanut dipping sauce. Overall it's the best having ate other Pho joints in rural & local areas."}
{"text":"Really good pho!   Not many great places to have pho in Phoenix. This is the best I hav had thus far in the area. The soup is not greasy and the meat is tender. It is a bit on the pricy side $9-10/bowl so that is a downside but worth it for the quality of the pho."}
{"text":"Hands down best pho I've ever had and I'm sad I live too far from them to go more often. Their ingredients are fresh, their service is quick, management seem like respectful people. The only thing I will say is that they often mess up my boyfriends order when he asks for no onions in his pho, 50/50 they will put them in his soup anyways, it really depends on which waiter we get. Also, their Thai tea is delicious! Definitely check this place out if you're in the area, if you're not then it's definitely worth the commute."}
{"text":"If you've read my other reviews, you know I have a soft spot for family-run businesses and this one is no exception. Having tasted a LOT of pho in my time, I have to say that this is among the best! It's wonderfully friendly proprietors and delicious options for both carnivores and herbivores! I recently had to make some changes to my dietary habits and tried their vegetarian pho for the first time today - absolutely delicious, super-flavorful, and loaded to the brim with crisp veggies. If you're a vegetarian and looking for a yummy vegan pho, check 'er out. If you're NOT a vegetarian, try the pho tai (rare slices of steak). Egg rolls and rice paper spring rolls are also tasty times, indeed!"}
{"text":"Wow! Extremely nice people. The owner was very helpful with suggestions and tips on how to dress the soup. Everything was so prompt without making us feel rushed. The #16 Tofu Pho Soup was delicious. Perfectly warm broth and fresh veggies. I will definately be visiting this place regularly, especially in the colder season. Can wait to try their unique looking dessert drinks."}
{"text":"This place just keeps getting better. This week , I finally ordered a non pho dish & it was AMAZING. I ordered from the vegetarian section of the menu, I forgot the name of the dish but it is the only one with WIDE noodles that is in the veggie section. OMG......this place rocks. The owners & staff are so nice too!!! Wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"This the second time I tried this place I would have to say Never again... I really would like to Forget this place exist.  MY usual Pho place was closed and I needed Pho to help me recover from the night before... So here I went with my kids.  Walking in was pleasant We got greeted, seated, and menus in hand.  I didn't like that they did not give my son a menu, he can read his 13.  Anyways we started out with the egg rolls and I got  Pho with meat and  my son got the chicken breast with rice and a child's pho for my little girl.  When the egg rolls came I was like WTH really iceberg lettuce to wrap my egg rolls : ( . Not impressed . Then it took awhile for our soups and entree to come out and when it arrived... DISAPPOINTMENT!!! Now everybody should  know that the broth is what matters and it tasted like chicken/beef broth, the beansprouts and basil looked sad.  The basil looked like it was picked over. My sons chicken didn't look like a chicken breast.  It looked like they took half of the breast and half it again then smash it flat.  it was too sweet and uneatable. The service is good and the food is Phogettable."}
{"text":"Superb pho, been to at least 8 pho joints in the valley this ranks up high on the list, always fresh ingredients possibly it being close to the Mekong supermarket. :)"}
{"text":"I am Vietnamese and since living on my own I never found a restauraunt that reminded me of MOM. This place does, and the owner resembles my Mom too! lol  I come here weekly with my BF and the owner & staff recognize us as soon as we walk in. Everyone here is so nice. Flavorful dishes, quick to seat & serve.  It's always a pleasure to come here...just wish we found it sooner!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place,  did a search for a place nearby to eat something different.. seen this place had nice reviews and close and we my wife and I liked a Vietnamese place near our old home so thought it would be good to check out.  The people were really friendly and helpful, Wife had asked how to pronounce a few things in there language and she seems excited to share with us and then would tell us how to say each thing they brought to the table it was fun she would make sure we pronounced it all correctly before moving on to each new word.     The food was wonderful I had a 41, wife was like a 38 or something and son got a 14.  she then taught us the proper way to prepare to our taste each thing we ordered and how to eat them.  We shared around the table what we each got and all of it was great.  Oh don't forget to get the coffee if your a coffee lover its almost like having a nice little dessert drink with your meal..   Service even though very busy was quick and very friendly we had at least four people stop to make sure we had everything we wanted. prices were good but the food was outstanding.. we will be back for sure to sample more items soon."}
{"text":"This restaurant is not too bad for arizona but nothing like la and sfrancisco vietnamese restaurants. The only complaint that i have is charging .50 cents per togo order which i really never heard off or experience before, it's the principle not the money. Prices are already high as is and the orders are kinda  skimmpy, i will probably  not go out of my way to dine at this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is great.  The service is extremely fast and very professional.  I love their  ice coffee with the condensed milk as I get it every time I go.  Also, their Pho and spring rolls are awesome!"}
{"text":"This place has the best vegetarian Pho I have ever tasted.  The spring rolls are also excellent.  The atmosphere is quite modern and fancy for being in a grocery store plaza.  For the price the place is amazing. It is the best restaurant I've been to in the area (definitely the superior than the other places I've visited in Mekong Plaza)."}
{"text":"I've tried other local Vietnamese places but nothing compares to this. I cannot describe how good their pho is. You really have to go in to try it out, you will not regret it.  Me and my girlfriend have been going here for almost a year because its that great. The owner/s know us now and we don't have to tell them without onions because they remember. A HUGE bowl is like 8 dollars but it will definitely fill you up."}
{"text":"If you're afraid to try UnPhoGettable, have a seat inside the modernly decorated restaurant and ask the owner to explain the cuisine. For a first-timer like me, I needed the explanation (What the heck is Pho? How do you say it? What are your recommendations?)  If soup isn't your thing, they have plenty of dishes that will satisfy hunger. I always order the combo platter which comes with a seasoned pork chop, chicken wing, spring roll, rice, and a small bowl of seasoned broth. To die for!!!   Service is incredible. They remember us every time we come in, which makes me feel like this is a family place.   If you like coconut, try their coconut juice. They add in a touch of sugar and some young coconut flesh that is really good.   Don't forget to peruse the Mekong Market after you're done with the meal (don't let the smells scare you away. They have some pretty cool stuff in there with amazing prices on produce.)"}
{"text":"My first time eating pho and it was delicious. I had the number one with all the meats. We also tried the soft egg rolls with Vietnamese sausage and they were delicious. I ate mine with the fish sauce. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"My wife loves this kind of food. Not so much myself. Great quality food in just a meet and potatoes kinda guy. Service here is impeccable. These people got their shit together. If Asian cuisine is your thing, then this place is truly unphogetable."}
{"text":"I can never understand why this place has such great reviews!?!? It boggles my mind. The pho here is just alright, what really gets me is the pricing. It is way too pricy for sub-par pho! this place was unphogettable, for being pricy and not flavorful!"}
{"text":"Been here twice. I really like that this place is just located right after mekong. Hopefully tey got bigger place next time."}
{"text":"Great name, great location ...  Right outside the Mekong supermarket ... really can't beat that ...  I guess given its geographic advantage, the quality is only secondary.   I went there twice, the first time, my impression was OK pho as I was with a group of friend and didn't pay as much attention. 2nd time... went there after grocery in Mekong and paid a bit more attention to the food .... honestly, it's really just a OK, or can I say OK-minus  If you were in the area and looking for good pho, I would recommend to go across the street to Blue-Moon. Much cheaper (like $5-6 vs $8+) .. i know we are talking about 2 bucks .... but hey that's like 40%, and the quality is much better...   But if you were really craving for pho and can't just wait to cross the street, this is a OK place."}
{"text":"The best Pho around, hands down. You won't be disappointed. Service and presentation were great."}
{"text":"Yes...  going to have to say it... lives up to the name!!!  I have never been to a pho-stablishment that features the variety of regional cuisines of Vietnam.  Just happened that we had the owner take our order.  He was very willing to spend the time explaining the various regional variations of noodle soups on the menu despite it being a busy Friday night.  Not to mention, the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Definitely phogettable! Waste of $40!  Our first and our last- food portion sucked for the price. We had crispy roll for $7 they were tiny with rarely any meat and tasted like mush! My bf had the sliced pork rice plate for $11 but was really only worth about $3- the pork slices were so thin, it looked like a kids plate! I ordered the fried rice which was okay- the meat tasted old and hard.  We still tipped a good amount smh Just going to stick to what we know and like best- Saigon Pho! They never let us down and price is half of what this place charges!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Pho place. Fresh and yummy! Lots of noodles too! I will be a returning customer."}
{"text":"The pho here is the best I have ever had - amazing broth.  The other food, I would not recommend.  There is another place just a couple of blocks away with better spring rolls/pork/shrimp/beef.    Again, pho here is simply perfect.  But the meat dishes here are usually overlooked - beef has that over cooked beef taste, pork in the spring rolls also has that overlooked tasted, and the shrimps are cooked to the point of being dry."}
{"text":"The food was excellent!!! Everything tasted fresh and delightful. The staff was kind and very welcoming. . I rarely get GREAT customer service because I have three young children and they do cry and throw tantrums, but the staff here was amazing and welcomed us with a smile..My New place to come  for my pho fix and I will be recommending this place to family and friends.."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pho place, and I've tried a couple others in the valley. The service is the fast, the staff is friendly (and remember you if you're a regular), and the food is yummy! I love the peanut sauce that accompanies the spring rolls and the pho hits the spot every time."}
{"text":"This place is the best.  The food is fantastic and the owners are great.  We bring our own wine and everyone knows us when we walk in the door.  The Pho is great, the Autumn Roles are fantastic, and the rice noodle salad is a must."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service, perfect size portions for the price! I will never get pho anywhere else. The market that they are located in is great for shopping and browsing after a big meal. It couldn't be better... btw try the shrimp spring rolls! Yum!"}
{"text":"The pho here is average compared to the legit ones back in Westminster, CA. For $8 a bowl, I was hoping that I would receive way more meat in my bowl.  The service was great. They were very welcoming and was always filling our waters.  Overall, I didn't rate this place too highly because of it's expensive price. Right across the street you can get a bowl for just 1/2 the price."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food I've had, and I've been to some very good Vietnamese places. Very fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Great service and wonderful food. Even when it is busy, you are always greeted and taken care of."}
{"text":"I moved to the Phoenix area a few months ago, from the Santa Cruz/South Bay area in CA, wherein I was spoiled with amazing pho houses all over the Bay Area.  This place is close to what I'm looking for in a great pho place; the pho itself should have a clear, flavorful broth sans MSG and excessive fat droplets on the top; noodles should be cooked, not overcooked, falling apart, or clumping; rare beef (tai) should be sliced thin and given abundantly, not overcooked (if served in the broth).  There are a variety of atmospheres, from cafeteria style to very cozy & relaxing... I like something in the middle with friendly, helpful staff sans excessive hovering. Here, the ambiance is a little off... more cafeteria style, especially with the double doors looking inward into the Asian shopping plaza.  Definitely very casual; the space is small and there were way too many people working.  I was greeting quickly... by three different people.  I asked the first server if they made the noodles fresh (rice noodles cook quick, so I pretty much expect this from a legit pho house) or if they pre-cooked and then put into the broth before serving (this causes the overcooked-ness & clumping); she wasn't sure so headed off to the kitchen to ask.  While she was gone, I was greeted by a 2nd server & let her know I was already being helped.  Later a 3rd server came by and took my order, I never got an answer about the noodles, so ordered the Pho Tai with fresh noodles and beef on the side, then she took off like a lightening bolt & didn't wait for my drink order.  It was served very quickly, so quickly that I was taken by surprise when they came bearing food :)  The broth and noodles looked perfect!  The broth was spot on!  I like the wider noodles (but this is more a Northern style pho & hard to find), but these were great, especially since they weren't overcooked.  The rare beef was sliced a bit too thick, but they gave a generous portion of 13 slices (extra is $3.50 for 10 slices). Since it's the broth that makes the pho; this place has definitely earned my repeated patronage... at least for when I'm in the mood for a very casual, cafeteria styled dining experience :)"}
{"text":"Great location within the Mekong Plaza. However, the Pho Dac biet price has now gone up to $9.25 a bowl now! Their quality is still decent, good broth and good amounts of meat in the soup but this is far too expensive for a bowl of Pho now. I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon until they adjust the price. If i can get a bowl of Pho for about $6.50 -$7.50 on the West side with better quality then there is no incentive to return to here anymore."}
{"text":"I was visiting from CT and when compared to my local pho, this pho restaurant is great.  The portions are large and the price is inexpensive.  The broth is rich and smooth.  The restaurant asked if I understood what I was ordering; to be certain I would not get an unpleasant surprise.  The owner came to check on us to make sure we had a great meal.  I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Very clean! Staff was very proactive in wiping things down and cleaning the surfaces in the dining area. Pho was really good, the broth was very tasty."}
{"text":"Awesome!!! I love the special chili sauce condiment they concoct in house. Friendly, great service, super clean. Would go every day if I could!"}
{"text":"Preston, you need to know about this one. Greeter explained the menu well, staff was friendly and courteous. Had Beef Pho with Brisket and Meatballs. Came with the bean sprouts and fresh thai basil.  Food came out quickly. rice noodles were well cooked. Vietnamese Coffee was good but high calorie. Attached to the Asian Market. One of the best small restaurants visited in a awhile I'll be back and send friends."}
{"text":"Unphogettable has always had fresh, high quality food in the many years I've been going there.   The service is good, and the owner is often there to offer recommendations for those new to Vietnamese food.  I typically get pho, but they also have unusually good fried rice (which may not be on the menu)."}
{"text":"Best vermicelli salad! They have 2 locations, one in tempe and one chandler. My family is vegetarian and we have been coming to this family owned restaurant for the last 9 years. So excited that they are at Dobson and Warner. A lot closer than Dobson and Main Street in Tempe.   The consistency is always on point. We have never been disappointed since we have been coming here. I really enjoy the service and food. The owners are so friendly and nice, and the customer service is great! I'm not sure what the other reviews, I completely disagree. Give this place a try, their food is great."}
{"text":"One of the best Pho Tai's I have had in a while. Hubby had a vermicelli dish and he loved it too. Service was great and super fast and tech place was bright and clean. Definitely going back when we come back to town."}
{"text":"I moved here from California. I was worried that I wouldn't find a place to get my spring rolls and pho. But I did. This place has a very friendly staff. We had a guy as our waiter. He was very helpful. The pho is always great. The springrolls could be better."}
{"text":"This restaurant was quite \"phogettable.\" They give you iceberg lettuce to \"wrap\" with, the fried egg rolls (\"cha gio\") were just below mediocre, and the sauce on my grilled pork chop was painfully sweet (I could barely eat more than a few bites, eve after trying to rinse the sweet sauce off with fish sauce). We also found a hair in our food, which always sucks, and there was a fly buzzing in our faces the majority of our time there. The only aspect of the meal that was alright was their Thai iced tea. That was it. The prices were definitely too high and the food was generally bad."}
{"text":"First off the owner is outstanding, very friendly and personable! I come here once a week and every time it is absolutely amazing! Rolls are perfect!! LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"The service is great, and the pho lives up to the name.  The prices are great, and the service is good too.  The location is great too, if you're not too full stop by the bakery next door, they're great too."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! The service was great, the place was clean, the atmosphere was lively, the food was well priced, and the pho was as described \"unPhogettable\". I would recommend this place to anyone in confidence. It's had been a long time since I've left a restaurant so satisfied. Get the #9 pho combo!"}
{"text":"Great Pho but I don't tip at this place. I found out a while ago from a few workers there that the owners take the tip from the servers. One worker went on to say that even if I tried and put the money in their apron, they would still get in trouble if they don't give it to the owners. There are cameras everywhere. I thought that was kind of sad..so I rate this place a 2 star for good pho but bad business pratice.   So remember to not tip!"}
{"text":"I've been to Unphogettable at least a dozen times in the past 8-9 months. and absolutely LOVE it. Their food is relatively healthy in comparison to other Asian cuisine restaurants and the Pho is AMAZING....I've eaten at Da Vang about 4-5 times and this place is MUCH better. The broth in the Pho is flavored perfectly and the meat is oh so tender. I always get the #4 Pho with brisket and the #17 egg rolls, both of which are amazing.   The food is delicious, but it's the service that really makes this place. After having visited only 2-3 times, the owners now recognize me and my family when we come in and helpfully explain how to eat the food to maximize the experience.   The prices are reasonable, the food is good, and the service is top notch."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in the valley. Located in the Mekong plaza in Mesa, unphogettable serves a huge variety of pho. Its a simple concept, and a delicious one too. Piping hot broth packed with flavor. Very affordable and family friendly."}
{"text":"Used to go to this place once a week, but the service has gotten worse that I started finding somewhere else to go. Still 4 stars for the good food and the friendly owner!"}
{"text":"A tasty pho place that you can enter from the street or from inside the asian market that it's connected to.  I ordered the veggie soup with rice noodles. The soup arrived relatively fast and it came with a metric ton of fresh veggies as well as tofu. It was delicious!  The service was great - the servers were very attentive and friendly. I think 3 different people asked my husband if he needed a refill on his water.   I really liked this place and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"when i read the menu it said that it had different seafoods + tofu but the bowl brought to me had two tiny shrimps and a little piece of tufu and excess of noodles and warm water and poor quality soup at its best and 10.99 for such a soup which could be cooked better at home.if i could rate lower than one star i would"}
{"text":"So I came to meet a friend around Mekong Plaza and she recommended us to eat here. I love pho, and usually don't have any complaints. I had the rare flank steak, and friend had the seafood pho (this one isn't on the menu, but if you ask, they'll accommodate!) . She enjoyed hers a lot, and mine was a-ok, I'd say I've experienced better ones, with more flavorful broth, and thinner-cut beef.   However, the service was outstanding!! Our waiter was very attentive, and made some good recommendations that made me wanna go back for some other ones!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough positive things about Unphogettable.  Everything is homemade with the greatest of care, always fresh, and always excellent service. The portions are more than generous, and the prices reasonable. The pho is amazing, as is everything else I've ever tried. They always make diners feel like extended family. I've moved east, and I miss it terribly!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's very clean and the staff is very friendly - the owner is usually there and is very attentive. My husband, daughter and I go every week and haven't had any issues.  We always order the #9 (beef pho) and the combination fried rice. Both are delicious. The fried rice is very light and not greasy - my daughter loves it, it is a very big portion, so be prepared to box it up (it does reheat very well too).  I recommend this place over any of the other pho restaurants in the area - by far the best we've had."}
{"text":"I normally want to avoid a kitschy place like this that white-washes everything. Well, it proved me wrong.  This place had the most outstanding service of any place, pho or otherwise, that I've been to, especially on a packed Friday evening. Quick table, ordering, and constantly making sure I was doing good. It took a little longer for the pho, but when it's a packed house, it's understandable. They seemed to work quick and hard there, even fixing up some messed up orders at the table next to me.  Had a typical pho tai, which was served already in the broth. Again, understandable to help ease health concerns, but still trying to find a place where I can cook it to my liking. The broth is as the other reviewers have said: flavorless. I had to mix in other condiments, but I did like their version of sriracha. Price point was also a negative as well.  Overall, it was a fine place, with the only dings being the price and bland broth, but the service really makes me like being there. I would definitely be open to future visits."}
{"text":"My first Yelp review ever!  Went for weekday lunch here with a coworker.  The resaurant is situated on the left side of the entrance to the Mekong grocery store (which, by the way, blows Lee Lee's away).    The service was fast and very friendly.  On the clean scale I give it a 10 out of 10.  Our waitress took the time to ask us if we have had pho before (a first) gave us the general overview of the menu (a first) and when we went to pay they wanted to know how we found the place (also a first).  Normally at a Vietnamese place there is little eye contact with the workers and little conversation.     We had the beef pho, it arrived very fast, less than 5 min, and it was delicious.  Spring roll also very good.  Would have given 5 stars if they took my plate when I was done.  Otherwisea  great experience and I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've tried four different pho places in the Valley and this is one of the best. It is on the more expensive side but I have been here about six times and the pho has been good everytime. The spring rolls are really good as well. Have not tried anything else there."}
{"text":"Best vietnamese in Mesa. Service is wonderful and welcoming. Great chefs! Everything I have tried so far was excellent. I love love love the summer rolls. Price is reasonable. Place is very clean."}
{"text":"Our regular Pho restaurant wasn't open so we gave unPhogettable a try.  Such a pleasant surprise!  We were sat immediately, the dining room was impeccable and the service was so attentive and friendly.  The spring rolls and Pho were super tasty as well.  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Not a super experienced Vietnamese food consumer, but I appreciate a good bowl of noodle soup, and this was fantastic. Appropriate portion of hot, rich, slightly spicy broth with soft well textured noodles; brisket, shaved ribeye, beef meatballs, a bit of fat, some ribeye cap strips, and tripe in the bowl. Fresh sprouts and greens on the side with a couple slices of pepper and a lime, some great chili sauce and a bit of bean curd sauce on the side - bam. Fantastic service; talked to the owner for a moment and he informed us that they're open all day on the same shift of workers, all of whom were kind and knowledgable (not to mention being on the ball refilling my diet coke). Highly recommended, and definitely returning."}
{"text":"My Vietnamese friend invited me today for lunch at this place, I ordered the Pho n°9 and he took the n°1. Both were really good !  I will be back for sure!  And it's also great that after you can go do your shopping in an Asian market , there are so many product that I discover today !"}
{"text":"The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful - almost to the point of being invasive. It seems like the Vietnamese places I go to are either extremely helpful or extremely neglectful to their customers! I guess I'd prefer the former.  The food was great! I had a bowl of the Vegetable Pho with Beef Broth and was surprised that they also offered vegetable broth as well. My vegan friend was especially happy with the vegetarian option. I would recommend unPhogettable to anyone in the East valley craving good Pho."}
{"text":"If you are a big fans in viet food, this is definitely a place you looking for.  The place is clean and neat.  The food are so delicious that you won't regret to visit.  Definitely will visit again!"}
{"text":"This is the best Vietnamese I have in Phoenix is worth the trip to Mesa.  If you want great fresh Vietnamese food at reasonable prices, then make the trip to Mesa.  Service is outstanding, I really enjoy the service - they explain in detail.  I've been able to venture out and enjoy new things.  Try it and you'll be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and I've loved it every time! The food is fresh and MSG free and the prices are reasonable. The service is fast and super friendly! I enjoy going to this restaurant and will continue to go here when I'm in the mood for pho."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying pho, but I wasn't impressed. I ordered the seafood pho and it had two pieces of shrimp in it. The broth was very flavorful but the lack of seafood was disappointing. The main reason why I am giving this place one star is because the owner takes the tips from the servers. I read a review on Yelp with this information, and confirmed it with the server when we arrived. There are also two cameras in the restaurant, I assume to ensure that the very nice and efficient girl who helped us wouldn't be slipped anything without the owner's knowledge. This kind of practice is pathetic and unacceptable to me. Tips are for servers who work hard, not for the owner to steal. I did not leave a tip and will not return, as I will not support this unethical business practice. Please consider this if you choose to visit Unphogettable."}
{"text":"This place is always busy! But I love coming here because the service is excellent & the food is amazing. It's more sanitary than most pho restaurants."}
{"text":"this is the best pho in arizona my hubby and i love it we lived in cali and the pho out there was awesome but this pho is better"}
{"text":"Had a craving for beef stew  one day and this place hit the spot. Definitely would eat here again!"}
{"text":"Had the Pho dac biet here for lunch. It was ok. Was expecting a bit more since it had a 4 star average on Yelp. Not worth $8.75 a bowl."}
{"text":"Friendly service, average pho, $9.00 for a bowl of pho. Flavor was good, but not great. Restaurant is clean, decor is modern, and right out the front door of the restaurant is the Asian supermarket. Heavily Asian clientele, so not sure if it's due to the proximity to the Asian supermarket, or if I need to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"One of my favorites. The owner and staff are friendly, courteous, fast and attentive. The food is delicious. Many Phô varieties to choose from. Love it."}
{"text":"Given the reviews for this place I had higher expectations. They put minimal may and noodles in our phos and we had to ask for extra on the side. The taste wasn't impressive either imo. On the good side, the place looked clean overall. We will be looking for a different place for good pho."}
{"text":"Food is above average but there are better pho places in Arizona. Their service is excellent so I'm giving them a 5 star.  I'm always craving Bun Rieu and I usually get it from here only to be disappointed.  There's not enough flavor in it I think so I usually just stick with Pho to be safe. After, this is a Pho place"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place ever to get pho! They give you a good size portion and their broth is one of the best."}
{"text":"Overall feel of this place is very busy and that is a good thing because it means people are there to enjoy the food. I got the pho with sirloin and it had lots of meat which makes a great bowl. This will be a place I will revisit."}
{"text":"Wow. Without a doubt, the best pho I have ever had. The staff is friendly and inviting, and the menu has a large variety, so there is always something new to try."}
{"text":"Clean and fast service restaurant. I am going there for 2 years and their foods always taste same. Servers sometimes forget, but the service is fast always. I will go there soon"}
{"text":"So the Pho is actually really good... as advertised."}
{"text":"Good Pho Tai!  The staff is very nice and would happy answers questions to help the novice."}
{"text":"First off, the pho here is the best in Mesa/Tempe. Also, the owner is so kind and friendly! And the staff is really accommodating when it comes to suggesting vegetarian dishes. A little pricey, but the all around quality here is well worth it.\""}
{"text":"Amazing Vietnamese coffee (which, itself, is glorious).  I had their pho #10. Delicious. Easily as good as any I've had anywhere else, including LA and San Francisco.   The restaurant is clean, good size, and has polite and efficient service. This is one thing that sets this place apart - sometimes really good pho places are small and crowded and kind of a stressful experience. This restaurant though is large comfortable and clean. Definitely come check them out. I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food was great and the people was even better. Super nice and friendly.   I ordered bun bo hue and it is the best Ive had. My family had pho and they loved it!   This is a must go to pho place if you're in AZ!!"}
{"text":"Truly excellent!  And the iced tea here is phenomenal! Can be highly addictive, so watch out!  Also, there is a green drink that is great for your skin that is high up on my list too.  The owners really get to know the patrons and do everything to make sure you have a great experience.  Highly recommend this place if you like pho!  Wish they were here in California..."}
{"text":"We go here at least once a week, for the great food and wonderful service. Everyone there goes out of their way to make sure everything is to your liking. We have to give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Super delicious!  They have super flavorful broth in the beef pho. Love the sides of mint and jalepeno. Have been 3 times in the last month.  Can't beat 10 for a filling and yummy dinner."}
{"text":"One of the members of my party was FORBIDDEN from getting the dish that she wanted.  That's right, they told her she was NOT ALLOWED to get that dish, being told instead that she would like the number four. They strongly discouraged my fiancee from getting his first choice as well. I don't know about you, but I think we should be allowed to order what we want, not what the staff thinks we should want."}
{"text":"After reading some of the other reviews, I thought I would try the \"S1\" which is not your ordinary pho, the noodles for one are a little thicker and the broth is both a little spicy and has a much more beefier flavor. Overall this place was good, but not as good as everyone makes it out to be in my opinion. I have tried my fare share of pho, at a handful of different across the valley, and although their restaurant may be nicer than most the pho does not compare to some of the places in the West Valley   Their service is amazing, just as everyone said and their coffee is also great!"}
{"text":"Just moved from California to Arizona. They say that southern California has the best Vietnamese food to offer outside of actual Vietnam. So moving to Arizona, I had to leave that behind and settle for wannabe Viet restaurants and whatnot.  So when I found unPhogettable, I shuttered to see a pho restaurant title without a number after it and incorporating a terrible pun that makes my teeth grind.  But I walked inside and hey! It SMELLS like a good pho restaurant! =)  Ordered a bowl of pho tai and it was pretty decent! The broth they make is surprisingly flavor and they somehow use less MSG and fats than their Californian counterparts without sacrificing flavor. So that was a very pleasant surprise for me.  One problem is that the pho is slightly overpriced compared to CA. But if pho is what you're craving, this is the place to stop! ^_^"}
{"text":"Decent food. Rude cashier/hostess workers who acted bothered to wait on me and seemed put off because I sat close to the register where they sat, they were even rude to other employees.  More expensive Pho than I'm used to in Phoenix area. Decent portions.  The rude ladies just gave me a bad taste. BTW I ordered to go and it took 1/2 hour for 1 order Pho."}
{"text":"First time having pho with my girlfriend I asked which one where good the said the shrimp and seafood and the brisket....they where on point bother were really good it was my first time having pho but thumbs up"}
{"text":"Extremely attentive, kind staff (even when the place was really busy and my 8 month old kept knocking spoons on the floor!) Ordered the #7 but with the S1 broth and #37. Everything was very delicious. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My friend brought me here to try Vietnamese coffee and it was amazing!! The staff was nice also. We didn't try any of the food, but it looked and smelled really good. I'll have to come again to try the food, but if you like coffee, come here and try the Vietnamese coffee!"}
{"text":"Awesome pho! Great service too. I have had the shrimp pho, and that's my favorite. My boyfriend had beef and loved it. We have been back a few times."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Pho and spring rolls. Servers leave a little to be desired. Not much personality. If you care about the food more than the people come here cause it was good."}
{"text":"The food is average but the portions for the rice plates pork chop n chicken were small n stingy! The pork chops were very thin 2 small pieces n the chicken breast was the same! And the service was bad! In addition, at the end, they automatically added an 18% tip on the bill and it was LUNCH TIME! I have no problem paying 18-25% tip for an upscale Steakhouse restaurant like Ruth Chris but NOT \"Pho\" for lunch! I WILL NEVER BRING MY FAMILY BACK HERE! There are way better Pho places that give healthy portions n taste great without forcing a big tip! I don't believe tip is forced but should be up to the client and based ON THE SERVICE OF THE WAITER OR WAITRESS!!! THEY DEFINITELY DID NOT DESERVE AN 18% TIP"}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here frequently.  Family atmosphere homey feel. We get the same thing all the time. Pha is our comfort food. Staff are like old friends. They remembered our routine pretty quick."}
{"text":"Good combo pho with beef, place is newly remodeled open seating,  nice friendly staff. Met the owner.  No wifi only reason I didn't give 5 star"}
{"text":"The place lives up to its name.  A+ experience.  Took my family to Scottsdale for R&R and got tired of eating at chain restaurants.  Decided to look for more interesting eatery and found a Vietnamese place near the resort.  Yelp reviews were really bad.  One of the reviews mentioned Unphogettable.  When I looked up Unphogettable on Yelp, there were many positive reviews.  Although the restaurant was 20 miles away, we took a chance and glad we did.  This was the first Pho restaurant that I've been to where staff were attentive.  Owner came by to ask if everything was ok.  Wow!  That was the first.  By the way, good food too!  We will definitely make an effort to go back while we are in town."}
{"text":"The food was good. Service was decent. The only thing I really did not enjoy was being seated next to strangers in a family-like dining table. I was there for lunch with a friend and it felt like the couple seated next to us (same table) were in our business, listening to our conversation. I'm not sure who enjoys that. But, I certainly do not. Next time I go back, I will make sure to request separate seating."}
{"text":"we had spring rolls and pork fried rice .. It was ok .. but came to $26 .. should have been more like $6.. basically waway way way over priced"}
{"text":"loooove their iced green tea and the vermicelli salad w/sliced pork and egg rolls. VERY clean and refreshing on a HOT summer day! But add some siracha for a nice kick! Fresh spring rolls are a favorite as is the pho, but honestly, the pho is better elsewhere.   Clean atmosphere, friendly service and they even got rid of most of the fish smell!"}
{"text":"The young lady that helped us was very friendly and the flavor of the pho was good. Just right across the street from my work-out place and so yummy!"}
{"text":"I went here today during the New Years celebration at the Vietnamese cultural center and I was really impressed on every front.  Service - The service was really friendly and they considerate for our 3 year old daughter. Appetizers came out rapidly and the main courses (pho for me and the mother in law, bun for my wife) came out at exactly the right time with genuine smiles.  Food - On the outside I was smiling, on the inside I was having a \"When Harry met Sally\" moment! I had the Pho with vegetables and rare steak. IT WAS AWESOME. The steak arrived rare within the Pho, but within a few minutes the hot liquid had gently cooked the steak throughout.  The pho was just a little bit salty (not bad though) so go easy on drinking it at the end but it created the perfect balance for flavouring the noodles and vegetables within it.  In hindsight, even though I'm sensitive to salty food I wouldn't have have changed a thing since the beef broth flavor infused into the ingredients so well.   FOOD ALLERGIES:  I'm always concerned about MSG in my food since I'm allergic to it and my wife and daughter are allergic to gluten. Well, we had no problems here. After we were done we were chatting to the owner and he was explaining their philosophy on cooking. They prepare everything from scratch with no MSG or artificial ingredient including the pho soup base and the fish ball and beef meatballs. He was explaining that the fish balls are simply flaked fish that's mixed with spices then reformed into balls (same for the beef balls too). He said he has a special technique for this that not everyone can master without adding fillers such as bread and that not everyone can do it. Who am I to argue? all I know is that next time I go I'll be ordering them.  Prices: $7.50 to $8.25 for main meals  Overall: Bloody Brilliant!"}
{"text":"This is in our regular rotation. Fresh, consistently yummy pho and really nice staff."}
{"text":"This place is always clean, friendly,and fast. I love the number 20 and I get it every time! Spring rolls are amazing, and always wash down with a Thai tea!"}
{"text":"This place has good prompt service and cordial staff. But the one grievance I have is that one day the womens restroom was occupied and so I used the mens instead, I went in right after a kitchen staff left and being a details kind of person, I noticed the sink was completely dry, not a sign of soap or water in the sink. He did not wash his hands! How do I know? Because after I washed my hands, there were soap bubbles at the bottom and the sink was wet.  So gross!  Never coming back."}
{"text":"It's good although portions could be a little bigger. Located outside of a grocery store which is useful to keep their ingredients fresh. They probably just go to the store when they run out of veggies or something. Freshest veggies I have seen at a Pho place. I'll definitely stop by again the next time I'm in Arizona."}
{"text":"If your looking for the #1 Pho place, this is it! Sick, hungover, or just looking for a great pho?  Gotta come here! I was turned on to this place by friends and it is GREAT! Service is awesome.  It's a bit cozy, but it's definitely worth it.  I've tried multiple of options and a salad from here.  Every time is better and better.  This place is a must, and worth traveling if your a Pho fan!"}
{"text":"I gotta say the pho was ok at best. The broth was bland and there was not much meat nor noddles. The \"fixings\" were lacking as well. Service was fine, but with so many pho options in the valley I find it hard press to return."}
{"text":"Took my daughter here for lunch and since it was cold today for Phoenix we both ordered the pho.   It was very very good.  The portions were huge with tons of meat and noodles.  The broth was uber tasty.  This pho is better then our stand by place we always go to and the portions were bigger and cheaper.  There was quite the variety of pho and soup to choose from.  I will come back here again."}
{"text":"My husband and I both love this place!! The staff and owner are ALWAYS nice.  We have gotten our family hooked on the chicken spring rolls, it's not on the menu but they are always willing to make it for us with no extra charge.  My husband always gets the pho ga and I always get the mi ga."}
{"text":"My go-to pho place! Their coffee and orange juice is to die for. Fresh squeezed OJ and it literally takes 5-10 minutes to come out because they're in the back making it from oranges. SO GOOD. Their pho is amazing and the service is incredible. I love this place and I've been going there for years."}
{"text":"I became a pho-llower of this soup almost 15 years ago, and when I first came to \"Pho\"-enix from Dubai (a sad, sad land of no pho), imagine my delight when I started to believe that the city was named not after legends of birds raising from flames, but from the sheer number of pho havens full of steaming noodles.  But the food here?  Pho-nomenal!  Bar none better than any in the valley- read more below!  Real cuts of steak, so tender.  A broth that has been lovingly looked after for almost 24 full hours.  But the real gem is the hospitality.  Chan raised my level of pho trivia by at least a third, and articulates with just as much pride and passion in describing his approach (fresh, quality ingredients, with time & attention to preparation) as he clearly does insisting on quality control in their dishes and making his guests feel at home.  His demeanor matches his craft in creation of such a \"Cheers\" style ambience.  Neighborly.  Welcoming.  Will I ever consider going to another place in town?  Pho-gettaboutit. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ More detailed info, for my fellow pho-natics:  I generally categorize  my places of pho pilgrimage in two categories: the first is the hole in the wall, bright lights, fish tank, sparsely decorated, plastic flowers with awesomely bad music videos playing in the background.  The second, is the tastefully-decorated, McDonald's equivalent, where all of the fun meat additives are homogenized into two choices of \"beef\" or \"chicken\" along with a host of barely recognizable broken rice & bun dishes.  And the food usually ends up about as bland as the décor in the first category.  As a pho purist, I had clearly opted for the former.  But Un-pho-gettable is the first place I've found that has every element of their business plan in synch- service, quality, enjoyable experience from the moment you walk in.  I had held strong to the New Times darling recommendation, thinking since N Phx was closer it would merit my continued patronage.  Then I branched out, trying Ha Noi Pho & Anise in Chandler, the two more pho-gettable restaurants by LeeLee's Market, Blue Moon (don't fall for the 50% off specials!), and various others, and then finally, I was \"saved\", the moment I walked into un-Pho-gettable.      Trying to make  \"Pho in a can\" with those sauce packets at home?  I don't recommend (Blue Moon is a close replica).  What I do recommend, is you drive tomorrow for lunch, no---- drive right now- immediately to Dobson & Main.  PS- They have really cool t-shirts."}
{"text":"Great Food. The Pho, the rice plates and spring rolls are delicious! However, it's kinda pricey and the service is not always the best."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pho joint in all of Arizona. I have been to about 17 from flagstaff to mesa to central and Tucson! The owners are so welcoming and very proud of their business and it shows! The place is always clean and the bathrooms are immaculate! I always order pho Tai and water.. But I've had both their egg rolls and spring rolls both excellent! I love the broth! It's true pho broth.. It's not the beef bullion cubes other place use and you can defiantly taste the difference! The sprouts are the cleanest I have ever seen! I love this pho place ...  try the greatest pho in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Flavor: 3 Waiting time: 2 (they accidentally threw the paper where they wrote down the order so we had to wait 45mins for our food!---it didn't taste as good as we thought it'd be! AND NO DISCOUNT OR ANYTHING! Just SORRY! Place: 4 Price: 2"}
{"text":"Had the #1 Pho and it was amazing! Also had the Autumn Rolls, which were great especially with the peanut sauce. The service is great and the owners are friendly and very appreciative of their customers. This place is a hidden gem. Glad I work nearby!..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I used to eat at Pho Ao Sen on Dobson and Baseline but decided to try unPhogettable after it won \"Best Pho\" according to the Phoenix New Times. I also have always been fond of Mekong Plaza.  I almost feel like I shouldn't be sharing this with every one because I'd like to keep it my own little secret. The New Times never steers me wrong.  Great service the second I walked in the door. They have their own homemade sauces (plum sauce and two spicy sauces). When I opened the menu, I was astounded. At least $1 cheaper than Pho Ao Sen for every menu item. The spring rolls (#A2) were amazing with shrimp. They were so fresh.  Then I got the #9 pho with well-done brisket and rare steak. It was as good as it gets. Afterwards, stopped off at the supermarket and bought some well priced and tasty sake.  I will definitely be back. Yum!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for a big bowl of tasty pho! I bring new people here and have never had a disappointed reaction. It's fun to go explore the market and bakery once you're there too."}
{"text":"We are so happy to have this place close by now! Fresh and delicious food. Pleasant and attentive service."}
{"text":"This is our favorite standby. We have been going to the mesa locotion for years and were happy to see he opend this one. The stoor is clean the staff is attentive and the food is always on point! I am looking forward to many more date nights at un pho."}
{"text":"The service and hosts are super-friendly. I came here with friends and it seemed like they have many regulars since the host and waitresses knew customers by name or remembered something about them = good sign!  The prices were a bit more than what i expected - around $7.50-$8.50 for a regular or specialty pho. I am originally from san diego - this place is decent. The broth isnt as aromatic for what i am used to but pretty good for mesa! The bowls come out big but have a lot of soup rather noodles.  They are generous with their beansprouts & basil. Its conveniently located in mekong plaza so you can do grocery shopping before or after."}
{"text":"This was my first Pho experience...  When we went in we were promptly greeted and seated. We told our server that it was our first time (*blush*). She was really cool and recommended some traditional dishes. I chose the rare steak with flank Pho and my friend had the chicken Pho. It Arrived very quickly and it was steaming hot with a beautiful side plate of goodies to add. The server even mixed up our sauce for us. The servings are huge and a good value for the price. I took half of mine home.  I will be back! Go Pho!"}
{"text":"I LOVE pho & wanted to get a quick pho near the Mekong grocery store so we came in. I'm only one year new to Phoenix & have been trying as many pho places as possible. The service was quick but the servers we short & rude. I ordered the pho with everything. This place may be called unphogettable but my pho was very phogettable. It was under average & the prices are the most expensive that I've seen in Phoenix. I will not be coming here for pho again."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed lunch here. The food is good and the service was excellent.  We used to come to pho van that was in this same location so we weren't sure how it would be.  UnPhogettable  completely remodeled and updated the place. We were very happy. We will return."}
{"text":"THEY EMBARRASSED ME! Would of been a 5 star rating, however, when i tried to pay they came back and told me my card declined VERY LOUDLY.. They could of said it a little quieter, but no, they caused a scene and called me out. Other than killing my vibe the pho was decent."}
{"text":"I have been to other Pho places, and realize how good this one is. I have been a few times, and decided to take my mom to a different Pho place. I shouldn't have, this is the place to go for the best Pho."}
{"text":"BEST PHO EVER! I always get the shrimp pho and spring rolls. The only downside is that they don't have alcohol. Service is awesome!"}
{"text":"Is their name presumptive? Yes. Are they truly unphogettable? Yes! Some of the best pho in town; get the rare beef pho. Drooling just thinking about it"}
{"text":"I've had pho all over the country and this is one of the best I've had so far. The staff is very friendly and curtious. I will be a frequent customer here for a long time."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Very clean lots of smiles everywhere.  The food was excellent.   Lots of space on seating. The restrooms were very clean. I will return. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I decided to check out unPhogettable for the first bowl of pho that I'd be enjoying in AZ. Tasty broth, chewy tendons, generous meat, and as many bean sprouts, fresh basil, and fresh limes that you can stuff and squeeze into your bowl! Solid bet for a big, tasty, filling bowl of pho at a reasonable price ($8/9). Convenient location, connected to an Asian grocery store so you can walk on over and stock up on seaweed, longan and strawberry Pocky after finishing your pho."}
{"text":"Awesome!!!!!!  I had pho with well-done brisket and it was great.  I have a favorite Vietnamese pho place that is Zagat rated back in Philadelphia and the pho at UnPhoGettable was very similar.  The noodles are perfect and the broth was delicious.  The meat was also very tender, melted in your mouth and had no fat. The soup came with basil, lime, sprouts, and jalapeños like usual, which were all very fresh.  The service was great also.  Always had a drink, food came out fast, and very friendly servers and owners.  Great place for pho lovers!  I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I had to post this because I forgot a few months ago. I lived in the area for a year and this was the go to spot for me on the way to school  its right on Dobson road and after I went to mekong to shop I would always stop and get tea. I decided to sit down and boy was that a great decision, they were not only nice but fast! and the Pho was so good! and I honestly loved how fresh the vegetables were and how great the stock was. I asked for sauce because it wasn't on my table and they gave me extra stuff and asked me was I fine. I was just thrilled to find food that I was used to eating on the west coast so close to my house. I have no complaints and if I ever go back to visit friends I will be sure to stop buy and get pho and of course pick up some stuff from Mekong."}
{"text":"Great pho. Very nice place. Alot of food. Great priced. Will be back. The staff was friendly."}
{"text":"So the food here is ok, service is average, but I never expect good service at a Pho place, and they are slight higher than average.  The price for dishes here are about $1-$2 higher than I'm use too.  Bun are good.  Pho was good though I like the soup to come out piping hot, and it never is.  It's hot, just not steaming hot like I'm use too.  Decor is nice and clean, servers are generally friendly.  Where this place fails is in the nickel and diming.  They charge extra for getting your steak rare on the side instead of being in the soup.  There's also extra charge for take out so I've stopped getting that here also.  Worse yet, they charge extra for extra fish sauce.... that's like a hamburger place charging extra for ketchup.  I could understand some of these charges if the prices of the dishes weren't also above average.  On general principal though, charging a premium for the dishes and than charging extra for little things that should be free means this place is a once or twice a year place instead of once or twice a week for me."}
{"text":"This is probably the best spot for pho in the valley.  The service is always super prompt ajnd the staff is so friendly.  It's also conveniently l ocated right inside Mekong Marketplace so that I can get grocery shopping taken care of after a bowl of delicious chicken noodle soup.  Pho comes with bean sprouts, cilantro, basil, limes, and jalapeno slices.  They aslo have hoisin sauce, sriracha, and red pepper paste on the table so that you can customize your flavor to float your own boat."}
{"text":"First of all.  I had this order to go. Mistake. Had to assembly my self. Takes away from the whole pho idea. Was very tasty.  Now i know. Will be back for sure.  I will just eat in."}
{"text":"This place is great, the spring rolls here are exceptionally good. The waitress was really nice and we had excellent service. I decided to try something different and had a mild curry beef stew, it was really good. One of my favorite Pho's when I'm in this area."}
{"text":"Great, authentic Vietnamese food. Casual, clean, prompt service. Friendly staff too. Haven't tried Vietnamese? C'mon you're missing out!"}
{"text":"Yum. After doing some shopping at the Mekong plaza we decided on having lunch here. Very clean, which is a big plus for a Vietnamese establishment. The food was great, very tasty. Would love to back."}
{"text":"Really everyone? This pho place is by far ranked down there on the Pho places I've had. Growing up in San Jose, one of the largest Vietnamese comminutes in the country, I'll say I've been to a fair amount of Pho places. I drove to Orange County, CA all the time in college just to get Pho. I'd like to think I have some Pho cred. But hey I know this is AZ- the pho competition  is not like in CA where there's larger Vietnamese communities/restaurants. This place really skimps out on noodles and meat. Seriously for the regular bowl of pho it felt like the amount of noodles and meat you get for kiddie size. You know that feeling when you eat all the noodles and meat and you're FULL but there's still all the soup there? Yea not here! I also tried their pork and rice and it that was the nail in the coffin. The pork meat tasted like rubber and it was amazingly VERY dry. Also try not to burn the sauce on the pork- doesnt taste yummy. I hope I......wait for it......phoget about this place! Service was good though +1."}
{"text":"This is the first time we had eatten Pho and did not really know what to expect or for that matter what it really was.  Turns out it is broth, noodles, some veggies and different types of beef or chicken or seafood, but you probably already knew that. I had the number 1 (can't remember what it was called).  It was a beef broth with noodles and I added the veggies.  It had beef brisket, flank steak, beef tripe and tendon and beef meatballs.  It sounds like a lot but trust me it wasn't.  I mean there was a lot of noodles and broth but the meat and veggie portions were extremely skimmpy.  (Hence the 3 star rating)  The meat was also a little on the bland side but if you mixed the hot sauces in with it, it tasted better.  My girlfriend had the number 9 which included beef brisket and flank steak.  She also thought the same as I, but for some reason hers had an almost overpowering taste of cinnimon.  The service was beyond great and the lady that was either the owner or manager came to our table and talked to us for a few minutes.  She explained everything and also gave us suggestions.  We also had the soft spring rolls as an appetizer.  One thing I didn't expect was that they were served cold.  I think that we will probably go back and try it again but order something different."}
{"text":"I can't even begin to tell you how much I love and crave this place. Service is wonderful, the place is sparkling clean, and the food is soooooo so fresh everytime! I drive all the way from north scottsdale to eat here. They also have great vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Ok. Pho is just bunch of noodles with broth and couple skids of beef. No matter how good it's (not in the case of this restatement) I ended up paying $13+ for a bowl of soup a bit too much..."}
{"text":"This place is about 5 min from my place and is the best place to get pho, spring rolls, and fried rice. Haven't tried everything yet but I know they are all good!"}
{"text":"Tried unPHOgettable, the name captured me. Had #8 pho and my brother had #25, they were both ridiculously delicious. My pho was cooked amazingly well, added tofu, which was brilliant, and the jasmin iced tea was pretty great as well. Anybody who wants a well priced delicious bowl of pho, this is your next stop!"}
{"text":"I love this place. From the food to the service it's all excellent. Mom and I have lunch there at least once a month."}
{"text":"My other half swears by this place. He says it's the best Pho around. Being Asian I believe him. I usually get the combo plate which is chicken breast and pork chop with rice very tasteful. Service is always great here they are a family run business and it's refreshing to see. Living close we visit it often."}
{"text":"This is quite a turnaround from my prior visits to Unphogettable and from my last review.  I dropped by today to have some PHOs which my husband, in particular, adores.  It is probably his favorite Vietnamese indulgence.  We ordered chicken phos only to find the broth to be almost tasteless (the word almost is my concession).  I found the chicken meat to be rather strange-- thick slices of what appeared to be chicken but tasted more like turkey breast.  Is that so bad you ask? Well, I found the meat to have a tough, flavorless consistency.  As a cook, I have a feeling that the broth was created with some commercial bouillon and then pieces of chicken? turkey? were thrown in.  This makes sense considering that most of their menu is soup based.  They have to be using alternative ways of creating broth. When I make chicken soup, the meat in its bone creates the broth and then you pull the meat off the bone and voila! a delicious, meaty  chicken broth.  This was not the case here. It was probably the worst PHO we have had in a long time.  My husband commented that the PHO we had in Paris, France was one hundred percent better than this PHO??  Can you believe the french make better PHO than Vietnamese in Mesa?  I remember the PHO in Paris so I can't disagree.  The point here is that Unphogettable better step up its game because you can live on your past reputation for only so long.  I did notice that there were not many ethnics eating here only non-vietnamese locals.  I am beginning to wonder if these people are the ones rating the place 4 and 5 stars when Unphogettable no longer serves good food and has basically lost its mojo.  BTW, a little research led me to fact that their regular chef is no longer there.   I ,  for one , am NOT returning either.  (The service was fine)."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Pho joints in the east valley. The Manager and his wife are very friendly, my fiance and I Love this play. They actually give good service as well, which is hard to find at small business azn restaurants"}
{"text":"Pretty good pho and vermicelli noodle bowls. I'm vegan so I just have them give me extra tofu instead of egg rolls, or the veggie pho is vegan by default. It's the same quality as the Mekong location."}
{"text":"Just finished eating at unPHOgettable--I LOVE this place (second time I've been there this week). I am new to pho--but from what I can tell, this place gets it right. The servers (because everyone seems to help here) are super sweet and attentive and the food comes out FAST and piping hot. The owner says they cook the broth for 26 hours (and you can tell by how flavorful it is), the noodles are never overcooked, and we always get white meat (which I appreciate).  And let's be honest--the name of this place is awesome haha."}
{"text":"This was the first pho place I tried in the Valley after moving to Arizona. I found the ambiance to be very lively with at least 75% of the seats filled. This looked to be a good sign for quality food!   We ordered two bowls of pho, Vietnamese coffee, and fresh spring rolls. The service was very quick and the servers very friendly. The rolls were very tasty and fresh. My fiancé loved his coffee, but he is very particular about his broth and found it to be just average. I'm not as picky and was happy that my pho came along with tendon and tripe.   I shall be back for some more unPHOgettable feedings Pho sho!"}
{"text":"Good food bad service, I've been staring at our pile of plates for 30-40 minutes now."}
{"text":"This is like my Sunday afternoon hangover food. But I'd probably still have it all the other days too."}
{"text":"Thank you for offering vegan pho! Yay! It came with a mound of veggies (bok choy, broccoli, carrots, cabbage, snap peas, tofu) mixed with a light broth that wasn't overly salty. It wasn't mind blowing but, I thoroughly enjoyed my bowl. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. Looked it up on Google Local. Only one size. Recommend at least once. Also, the shrimp, rice paper roll is really good (A1). You should try it."}
{"text":"This is my other favorite phô in the Mesa-gilbert. My wife and I enjoyed the 4 and the 31 salad. We got it to go and even that was lovely. Delicious broth and all the right additions."}
{"text":"I went in to get the nem nuong cuon and a bowl of soup today. The nem nuong looked different so I called one of the girls over to make sure my order was correct. She said that it had changed. I told her that it didn't taste the same and she stated that it had changed since there is a new chef cook but it would taste the same. When I had a bite of it, it wasn't even close to what it used to be. I was disappointed and wont be returning. Now that there is a new head cook, I am guessing the dishes will no longer be the same. I use to come in weekly, but very disappointed in my meal today."}
{"text":"Staff is very busy running around, tending to the needs of customers coming and going. The spring rolls were very fresh and were served with a delicious peanut sauce. I have had numerous peanut sauces and they are usually colorless and tasteless which was not the case here.  My Pho was delivered to my table quickly and it was piping hot. A nice portion of fresh basil, bean sprouts, jalapeno slices and a wedge of lime was served on the side so that I could add to my liking.  Excellent bowl of goodness!   The place was very clean and the staff could not have been more attentive or courteous.   I will be returning without a doubt.  The menu was huge for a restaurant of this type.  Well done!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife just moved to the area, and have had bad luck so far with our pho experiences. UnPhogettable was a nice change however, and we were both extremely satisfied by the quality of the food. We ordered the pineapple cream puffs, the spring rolls, and two different types of pho. The spring rolls were very good, and very fresh, and rolled nice and tight so they did not fall apart in our hands. Overall we were very pleased and have found our go to for pho."}
{"text":"We love this place, i always plan to review but never do. The service is wonderful. The food is great. If you are new to Vietnamese food ask the waiter or waitress for advise on what to eat and how. They have a bunch of great new things. The fried rice is wonderful so go eat there (we will probably see you :P)"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try this Pho place for a long time as I shop at Mekong market regularly.  We tried Goi Cuon for appetizer.  It was ok, but the sauce was missing some flavors.  We ordered Pho with brisket, flank & lean steak and pork chop rice plate for main course.  The beef broth lacked the rich beef, herbs and veggie flavor, and the most disappointing, the grilled pork chop was drowing in a hoison sauce accompanied with steam rice rather than broken rice.  The menu clearly stated steam rice, but I should have stuck to my instinct that this restaurant lacked the authenticity.  When I asked the server for the nuoc cham dipping sauce, I had to explain the ingredients before they understood my request.    Sadly, my meal was Pho-gettable... Hopefully, it was an off day."}
{"text":"The pho is good and the place always busy when I come in.  The service is good but you have a wait a little for the food to come.  It worse the wait though because the pho is so good.  The place clean and nice and the services is good and the food is good, what more do you want."}
{"text":"Bomb dot com. I had the tofu pho and Thai tea. Omg the tea was amazing! The pho was medicinal! I met the owner and he was super nice. Our server was amazing as well. She tried to teach me how to say some stuff in her language and I really appreciate her patience. Everything was great! I've already recommended this place to many people. I'll be back for sure. I swear my day was amazing after eating there!"}
{"text":"Worst pho restaurant in town. They did not give much noodle for a large bowl. They even forgotten my drink even when I reminded them. The worst part, there was a bug in my pho."}
{"text":"Hasian: Hot + Asian  I love hot Asian food, and when you come to unPhogettable, that's what you will get.  I've been here a few times and I've NEVER been disappointed. The restaurant is attached to the Mekong Plaza.  On this lovely evening, I had the #1, and I had the rare steak on the side. The staff had no problem accomodating my request. The Spring (actually Autumn) rolls were phenom in the peanut sauce. Try it. You'll like it.  Everything is fresh. I don't have any complaints about this place. At least none that I would Yelp about.   The Pho is phantastic (see what I did there?). The broth comes out at the perfect temperature, and there are enough bean sprouts and basil leaves for your palate.   The name is cute. Duh."}
{"text":"I ordered a rare beef pho with added beef balls. The beef was chewy and the beef ball had an off-putting flavor and an odd texture. All could be forgiven though based on the broth.  Interestingly. when I first tasted the broth I felt it was ok. It didn't have the depth of the best of broths it town, but it had a flavor that was pleasant at first. I thought was better than some of the bland offerings around the valley. However, by the end of the meal, I would have preferred one of the more bland offerings. Imagine listening to the same musical note over, and over, and over, and over again. Silence is much better. That was how I felt about this broth. The same darn note over and over again. I did what I never do and started doctoring the bowl with sriracha, hoisin, salt, and by the end I even tried sugar.  On a side note, I had the spring rolls which were the worst I've had in town. The spring roll itself was flavorless and the sauce literally tasted like melted Skippy peanut butter, While I enjoy melted peanut butter on a toasted bagel, it's not exactly what you want as a complement in your Asian meal."}
{"text":"This place foods suck, pricey, and bad service doesn't deserve to charge 18% tips to customers. Never ever come back to this place again."}
{"text":"We're in Phoenix for our annual Baseball Spring Training extended weekend and we're staying in the eastern Phoenix valley.  We were planing in trying Unphogettable last year when we were here, but we got sidetracked and it was our loss.  The restaurant is in front of an Asian grocery store and we got there a little before closing (at 8p).  My wife and I ordered our usual of Spring Rolls and two Chicken Pho's.  The service was very friendly and quick.  We counted 4 different prople who stopped by our table to make sure everything was OK and our diet drinks were always full. The Spring Rolls were fresh, with a thin slice of pork roast and the sauce was peanut buttery.  I like my dipping sauce more on the hoisin side, but these had the first one that I actually really liked that was on the peanut side!  The Pho was good and very hot, with the chicken shredded into small pieces, akin to shredded pork, mixed well with the noodles.  The beansprouts, cilantro and jalapeno's that came with the soup were just barely enough compared to other soup places I had visited.  Overall, it was a nice place and we'll be back to try it again."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant that opened up where Pho Van used to be. This is the second location for Unphogettable. The renovations done to the space are very nice and the restaurant appears much cleaner than the previous one did. Service is very friendly and attentive. I appreciate that the restaurant opens early each day 9 am in case I am in the area and craving pho. I tried the pork vermicelli bowl and enjoyed it. The pork wasn't as flavorful as I am used too but the size of the dish was very large and had lots of delicious vegetables. I want to go back soon to try the pho."}
{"text":"I really liked the brisket pho I ordered here.  It was sooo good.  Quite honestly,  I don't know much about pho.  I've had it once or twice before.  It seems to be hearty noodle soup with rich broth that can be kicked up a few notches with bean spouts (for added crunch), fresh basil, hoisin and sriracha.    I love the fact that I have some measure of control over how spicy I can make it or how what I add can affect the taste.  Maybe I just like the process.  unPhogettable is a corny name.  I had solicited advise from my friends on FB on where to get good pho.  Khai Hoan was the definite consensus but it was closed that day.  unPhogettable was next.    Located in the Mekong Plaza, I did get the sense that it should be decent.  It's surrounded by other asian restaurants and an asian supermarket.  It wouldn't reflect well on the business if it wasn't good.  From the get-go, the service was friendly and fast.  I'm assuming it was the owner who stopped and talked with us but she was super friendly and helpful.  We ordered spring rolls (with pork and shrimp) served with peanut sauce, hot tea, vietnamese coffee and two bowls of pho (one brisket and the other veggie).  Everything came fast and was delicious.  The peanut sauce that accompanied the spring rolls was soo good.  I loved the pho.  It was tasty and hot.  Having added everything provided to me, it made the soup even better.  Like I said, I'm no pho connoissuer but this pho was really good to me.  All together I think it ran us $25. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My Vietnamese friend and I first tried the specialty Ban Mam fish based soup. The broth was salty but tasty.  Nice pieces of white fish and a few thinly sliced meat topped the noodles.  My  companion said the traditional piece of squid was missing though. Next The Tom Bun arrived.  Grilled shrimp accompanied by freshly shredded greens topped this dry noodle dish.  With the side of julienned pork we ordered, this entree was great!  In fact the pork with its special sauce would have been great on anything!   Even though the staff made the mistake of bringing us the wrong dish the first time, they were apologetic and friendly.  Clean tables, clean dishware were impressive.  The last Vietnamese spot I dined at did not present its self well in the sanitation department.  :)  We had a good experience yesterday and UnPhogettable is on my \"will visit again list!\""}
{"text":"Being a Californian from Los Angeles has spoiled me because I never knew that Vietnamese food could get so expensive lol. Over $10 for a bowl of pho that is considered a size small in the SGV? WHAT?   Anyway, I don't like pho. Never did, never will. So obviously I didn't try the pho here but I did get the vermicelli with egg rolls and pork, as well as the bi cuon and those two were okay. The vermicelli was sweeter than the ones in LA for some reason (maybe it's that fish sauce) and for $9, I guess it's okay. 2 small rolls of bi cuon for $5 was a blasphemy to me because back in the LA or even the OC, we could get 4 rolls for the same price that tasted much better. But, the ones here were still decent so I'm not complaining.  Overall: Food is good, prices could be better but hey since they don't have much competition, I guess it's okay."}
{"text":"The food was so good!  My friend and I both had the brisket pho and we shared the crispy spring rolls.  The pho was excellent!  The brisket was tender and delicious.  The pho broth was very tasty!  The spring rolls were also very good.  We never felt ignored because the service was fantastic.  Everyone working there was very attentive, polite, and quick.  I would definitely go back.  Perfect food on a cold night, too!"}
{"text":"Always amazing service! Always amazing pho! Add veggies to a meat dish! The spring rolls A1 & A6 are the best in town!!! We are now here on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"I was in the area one Sunday and decided to have lunch here. I looked at the name and thought....oh my...this is probably gonna be a mistake. Who names their restaurant something that corny and have good food!??  Boy, was I wrong!   The owner was very polite and nice, he was constantly checking up on us while we ate to make sure we got everything. The pho was .....\"unphogettable\"!!!! .....  I must say this is the best pho I've had since Seattle.  They had the pho out in like, 5 mins also...which is how long pho SHOULD take to make at a restaurant level.  I was very satisfied with the service and the food."}
{"text":"Don't ever go here. The pho broth taste so sweet with all the msg. This probably the last time I will be here"}
{"text":"I called ahead to order dinner for home.  I'd been here before,  and although it didn't stand out,  it wasn't bad..  That I remember.  I asked for something that was on the menu,  but was told it wasn't so got something else.  When I got there,  there was no one in the store,  and I didn't feel like my presence was making them too excited..   I ignore those things quickly  though and brushed it off.    I got my food,  and it was chicken pad Thai.  It was really dry..  Like crispy noodles burned to the bottom of a pan dry. So that was disappointing.  I didn't finish more than half of it,  and unfortunately probably won't be back."}
{"text":"The restaurant had really friendly service. Great on refills my drink never went under 2/3 . It was fairly busy, yet my food came out pretty fast. The portions are huge and tasted amazing. Any questions i had about the menu were answered quickly with no hesitation. Plan on going back very soon!"}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch. Very easy pay at the counter type spot but amazing food. Best pho!!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place.  We went in because our regular pho place was closed. I feel bad because we are now regular customers and go in at least once a week.  We get the same thing each time and they know our order.  They are super friendly and more than happy to explain how to eat the food if you new (wrapping egg rolls and using the sauces). Not to mention clean clean!  the portions are huge and enough for our family of three to share two dishes.  The soda with lime is amazing!  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Super not good. Ordered shrimp spring rolls and duck soup. The rolls smelled like my dogs infected ear. The duck in the soup was nearly inedible. Didn't finish everything just drank the broth and ate the noodles.  Worst $20 ever spent."}
{"text":"When have you ever visited an establishment who's greeting to you is \"Thank you for bringing your nice family\"  LOVE  This is noodle soup served with love.  Its also the only place we've ever eaten Pho, so I don't feel qualified to comment on the authenticity of the food, but it tastes so good, so fresh, so delicious, that even if it were not authentic, I would still give it 5 stars.  The last trip we made was an incredibly hot day, I ordered a lime soda (soda water and an abundance of fresh squeezed lime juice, with a lime wedge and ice....so refreshing!) with one of the salads...rice vermicelli with shrimp sausage.  Absolutely perfect for a hot day.  I enjoyed immensely.  Also, at the end of our meal, the owner came walking in and whether he actually recognized us or not, I have no idea (we've only been 2 or 3 times before) but he ACTED like he knew us and came walking up and again greeted us with \"Thank you for bringing your family today\".  Gotta love it."}
{"text":"The pho here is the best in Phoenix area. It will rivals many pho houses in California. The Vietnamese community is growing. And so is the taste for good pho. The broth, in the pho, here is all from scratch and no shortcuts. You can really taste the balance of flavors of anise, cinnamon, etc. If your not familiar with Vietnamese food. You don't have to worry. The service staff will politely educate you in the proper way to enjoy any dish. If your looking for new pho house or looking to try Vietnamese food. Come here"}
{"text":"My favorite dining option inside Mekong. I love the vegetarian bun. Lots of noodles and lettuce topped with crunchy egg rolls. It comes with a dark, flavorful sauce that substitues for the traditional fish sauce. I would like to see another topping besides eggs rolls like a faux (pho?) meat.   Tofu spring rolls and the accompanying peanut sauce is delicious. I can't specifically comment on any other dishes, but the family that I've brought here all love their dishes.  Service is so friendly and welcoming. UnPhogettable is one of those places where you feel like you're dining in someone's home."}
{"text":"We love this place! Great place especially if you are vegan. We like the harvest rolls and the vegetable pho."}
{"text":"It's always a pleasure coming in for pho here. Owner, staff and food is always exceptional! I've been coming in for lunch with my co-workers and always rant to others who never had Pho.   I always order the #8 with a Thai tea."}
{"text":"Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. We got there right before the dinner rush on Friday evening and we were seated right away.   They have a quite a few different options on the menu and different plates to pick from.   We ended up getting one kids chicken pho with rice noodles, one chicken pho, one seafood pho, and a grilled fish dish that came with a small salad and rice.   The pho's came out quickly and the fish plate came out a few minutes later. My chicken pho was just decent. The broth could've been better and it definitely lacked flavor. There were about 5 pieces of chicken in my bowl for $9.95.  The seafood pho had two pieces of shrimp, two pieces of calamari, and two pieces of shrimp cake. This was $10.95. Really wish it would have had more shrimp....   The fish plate had a small serving of white rice and a small salad. The fish though, was decently sized and it tasted good.   There was no soy sauce or forks at the table so we had to hunt down the waitress. She did come around for refills though and she did check up on us a few times.   We spent $45 for two regular sized phos, one grilled fish plate, one lemonade, and one kids chicken pho.   I wasn't too impressed with the pho as I've definitely had better tasting broth. They were also kind of skimpy with the meats. I've been to other places where they give you a lot more meat and the phos even cheaper. Maybe will be back if in the area."}
{"text":"I love Pho. I love mekong plaza and its potential.  Anyway- unPhogettable is a nice place to spend your Saturday after stocking up on Asian groceries. What I like about this place is how personable and amazingly friendly the wait staff are. Service was impeccable.  The pho was great- me, my sisters and grandma got a variation of different noodle dishes. We did one with seafood, one with tendon, and one with rare flank steak. We also ordered thai iced tea and vietnamese coffee. All of those were good, but not the best. One thing that I didn't like very well were the fresh spring rolls. I am used to the pho places in Atlanta serving fresh spring rolls with mint inside, and with bigger pieces of shrimp and meat.  So overall- food was okay, but service was amazing."}
{"text":"I mean, the place isn't TOTAL garbage. But frankly, I've been to better pho places. Places where the meat portions aren't so skimpy in the pho soups, and the vegetables served are diverse and multi textured. Also, the broth needs to be abundant and not skimpy either.  That's the thing, this place may have decent pho broth, but the fact that they provide so little quantity in the bowl that arrives for the price makes me want to make the extra drive westward towards central Phoenix to hit up a better Pho place. Or head south to one of the plentiful pho places in Chandler.  Then there's the vegetables. See, Vietnamese food is about textures. And vegetables are a HUGE part of Vietnamese cuisine. For instance, in the pho that I order from here, the vegetable dish that you're supposed to dunk into the soup, it really just comes with bean sprouts and basil, the two cheapest vegetables that a restaurant can provision to its customers. What about cilantro? That's cheap, why can't there be a plentiful amount of that on the vegetable dish? What about the infamous \"sawtooth herb\" that more authentic Vietnamese restaurants will carry?   So, authenticity. That's a big one. And it's hard to talk about \"authenticity\" because let's face it, Vietnamese cuisine as we know it in the USA is very \"southern Vietnam\", which is really a collection of Vietnamese and French influence. American too, if the Vietnamese food is from Saigon (which was occupied by the US during the Vietnam war).   I bring up authenticity because this place really doesn't hammer it for me. It seems like they take all the cheapest parts of American-perceived Vietnamese cuisine and serve it to you. A great example is their noodle dishes that come with lettuce. The better restaurants will serve \"green leaf lettuce\" and not iceberg. Iceberg is cheap, lacks nutrition and frankly doesn't taste good. Also, the lack of mint in these dishes makes me scratch my head as to why the restaurant almost deliberately holds itself back.  The only thing I can possibly think of is that the restaurant is trying to cater to a specific demographic of customer that devalues things like green leaf lettuce, mint, sawtooth herb. I don't buy the idea that the restaurant doesn't have the financial resources to provision these basic herbs that can literally be bought walking distance from Mekong Market in the same shopping plaza.  To end the review on a positive note, I will say this: It may have been smart for the restaurant to hire on servers that speak fluent English, however, part of me wonders why there is a need for that in the 21st century. Since everyone has a smartphone or at least an Internet connection, even newcomers to Vietnamese food can quickly run a Google search to determine what Vietnamese food is all about, and know upon eating at Unphogettable that this restaurant really isn't the place for a true Pho experience."}
{"text":"The pho and Thai tea were great. I'd maybe prefer a \"fast food\" variant, since the pho, drink, and tip were about $16 - kinda a lot for a work lunch... but it WAS great food! Also, our server showed us the \"right\" way to eat pho with the sauces - thanks for the tip, it was yummmmmmy!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and I'll most likely be back because I love that I can trust the meatballs to be GF but probably just for takeout due to poor service and a server spilling soup resulting in burns.   Food: I order the #1 Pho and A1 spring rolls with shrimp & pork. The pho is pretty good here and it's one of the only places that I can safely eat the beef meatballs knowing they are gluten free so that's nice. The pho is definitely the star dish here... spring rolls are OK but probably wouldn't order again.   Service: I don't expect a lot as far as service goes at any Vietnamese restaurant around town, however I would expect that when the server spills your piping hot bowl of pho all over the table and onto your lap and burns you that they at least wipe up the soup that is all over the table (or maybe bring you extra napkins or a towel to do so without having to be asked). Also, if I was an owner/manager and my server were to do so, I would be a little bit apologetic and maybe offer a discount or comp something... just a thought considering the fact that a significant amount of soup was spilled on a customers lap causing burns (I would post a photo to show but they are in places not appropriate for Yelp). They did give us a $4 discount on a $55 bill after we mentioned the spilled soup, but regardless... I get accidents happen. But typically it would (and should be) handled better."}
{"text":"Incredible.  I eat Vietnamese food in many cities and this is the best.  I usually order the same dish and have come to recognize if fresh ingredients are used.  This restaurant is great for quality and flavor of the food, clean and fantastic staff who are friendly and know their menu.  You will love it."}
{"text":"By far, this is one of the best Pho restaurants I've been to. Really friendly customer service, awesome food. The pho has no oil floating... healthy dining... Hands down, I give this place five stars... Please check out this place some time."}
{"text":"The pho was ok. Nothing really stood out. The service was really good. I usually order rare steak on the side with tendon. Why did they charge me 50 cents to have my steak on the side? If I knew that was the cost of labor then I would had requested it inside my bowl. 3 Star for the pho but 5 star for the service."}
{"text":"I wasn't super hungry but wanted a little snack. I ended up getting the A2 fresh rice paper rolls with Vietnamese pork sausage served with house special sauce. Great snack if you're not very hungry and want something to hold you over."}
{"text":"Best pho in the area. period.  Especially useful to soothe a sore throat or clear sinuses."}
{"text":"Craving pho on a Sunday morning, my friends and I decided to drive 20 mins to the only pho place available....this one. Location was cute and convenient, and attached to the shopping center's grocery market. When we walked in, it was extremely busy or anything so we were seated right away and given drinks.   For appetizers we ordered the spring rolls and the egg rolls. Disappointing. The spring rolls are a very easy dish to make, noodles, veggies, meat and sometimes you add shrimp......no, the noodles weren't cooked all the way, the meat was tough and dry, and the veggies weren't fresh, pretty sure the lettuce came out of a bag.  Not to mention the peanut sauce just tasted like straight up peanut butter, that's not how its remotely supposed to taste. The eggrolls were also subpar.  When it came to the entree I got a beef pho with flank, tendon and a few other meats. First thing I notices was that the broth was a lot more clear than any other pho I'd eaten. Rest assured, it tasted just like it looked, hot water! I drowned it in sriracha, hoisen and extra lime just to make it taste better. Meat again was dry just like the spring rolls had been. I was sad.....I just wanted decent pho and this was not it.   Not to mention one of my friends found a tiny piece of a plastic wrapper in her dish. Cute name, cute place.....food no bueno."}
{"text":"I don't know I haven't been coming to this place! Very tasty Vietnamese food and good service every time. The menu is large. The prices are a little higher than the average Vietnamese restaurant, but it is worth it! The average for entrees are $10 plus. Will continue to come back! Try the grilled chicken with rice! Yum!"}
{"text":"Most horrible I've ever had!  Over-cooked noodles, bland base and the manager/owner happened to stop by and asked how was everything, after I told him, he walked away saying or doing nothing.   Overpriced and bad food.  I am never eating there ever again."}
{"text":"Pretty much a regular here. They know when I don't come often lol. Pho is great here even the rice dishes are good. All the veggies are fresh. Try this place you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food and serivce was great- very fast service."}
{"text":"I came here a few times already and I can already say that my fav dishes here is the vietnamese spring rolls and well-done beef pho.. the staff is very friendly and it seems like a very clean restaurant. Only complaint is that the spring rolls are kinda small, but that's it. A bowl of pho ranges around $7-8, so price is pretty average. But as far an quantity, you will get plenty of beef, there's no skimping of meat in that area. The broth used is flavorful and has great aroma.   The owners seem like they really pride themselves in their food and service, and that to me is a good sign that they are always front and center of what's going on.I like how it's in the middle of the Mekong plaza, so I can get a bunch of shopping and lunch in while I'm in the area.   Good stuff!"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot on the East side for pho. The service is fast, polite, and consistent. It normally takes only but a few minutes to be served your food after ordering! They also keep the place clean and organized, and are very good about remembering repeat customers! I would highly recommend this spot and go at least once or twice a month myself."}
{"text":"This place will always be one of my top favs. They're clean, efficient, and always serve with a smile. A personal favorite that I would recommend is P4 (pho with the brisket). It's delicious. :)"}
{"text":"It is ok, the meat is a bit chewy, the broth was nice.  At $10-11 per bowl, it is pricey."}
{"text":"Amazing Pho broth is so rich and delicious. I never really eat the meat in pho so I can't judge. Staff is very attentive."}
{"text":"UnPhogettable- a poem Trying new things can be oh so frightful so it helps to have owners that are oh so delightful Start out with springs rolls to begin the meal, I liked the peanut sauce so much that I let out a squeal! And ah the pho, the main show if you will,  both my tummy and soul it did fill. I've also had their chicken dishes a time or two, those are quite good if soup's not for you. The lighting is dim and the tables lack in style, but once you get past that you'll be there a while."}
{"text":"$10 for mediocre pho? No thanks. You're basically paying for the convenience of eating next to Mekong Supermarket. Nobody should be paying over $9 MAX for a bowl of pho, it's outrageous.  Service and the restaurant itself was nice. The cell signal kind of sucks all throughout Mekong Plaza, if you are indoors. (I'm AT&T.)  To be fair, the Viet broken rice plate place across from Unphogettable is also super expensive, but their rice plates are SOOOO good.  On the other hand, Unphogettable's pho is totally forgettable, nothing to write home about, and wayyy too expensive for pho.  Their name is a cute pun though."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Nice decor,but a little dark.  reasonable wait time for food."}
{"text":"My favorite Vietnamese noodle place in the area. All of the soups are great and the price is reasonable. Spring rolls appear to be made to order and not prepared ahead of time and refrigerated. Service is prompt, the restaurant is a quick in and out for families. If you've had enough of pho, the bun bo hue an the duck leg soup are great. Along with all of the vermicelli bowls. The grilled pork is particularly good.   My only gripe is that they don't offer the kids pho for carry out."}
{"text":"Update 1/12/12  Gave it another try because one feller on here said the egg noodle-wonton dish was the best thing he ate all year, and it was their special, so...  THAT was the best thing you ate all year!?  Pretty tasteless watery broth, and ingredients were pretty tasteless too, and sparse leaves, and over-priced - $8.50, I think it was - too.    1 1/2 rounded up to 2."}
{"text":"My bowl of Pho Ga was served in less than 5 minutes from taking my seat. I've never experienced service that was so fast, attentive and beautifully mastered! The flavors were phonominal and they don't skimp down on the portion of meat you get. A lucky find, Truly unPhogettable"}
{"text":"Having owned a restaurant for 15 years, I notice everything when I dine and consequently, I am very picky. I am completely at ease and delighted by this restaurant. I really appreciate the freshness of their food and recognize that they do not cut corners on their ingredients. Their broths are WONDERFULLY flavorful. I usually choose a vegetarian dish and my husband likes seafood. We eat here at least once a week and have never been disappointed. Do try a Vietnamese dessert for a fun and delicious experience.  (BTW, they cater to those who must follow a gluten free diet).  The decor is attractive: a lot of windows, black and white photography, pendant lamps, two flat screened televisions on mute, American music at an unobtrusive volume, and what I really like --- the place is exceedingly clean, including the bathrooms!   The owners of Unphogettable are a married couple, who work very hard and have the most hospitable personalities. They not only make the environment pleasant for their guests, but have  created a good working atmosphere, as is evidenced by the happiness of their employees.   In closing, I couldn't be more enthusiastic in my recommendation of Unphogettable."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place! The food is amazing and the customer service is probably the best I've ever experienced. Every time my boyfriend and I dine here the owner visits with us and asks how we are, etc. I've only had Pho at a couple of places in town so I can't speak to the authenticity but it tastes amazing and fresh every time. Places that make good food and offer the kind of customer service these places do (and family owned is always a plus for me!) are just priceless. UnPhogettable is always worth the drive to Mesa."}
{"text":"My favorite local Pho place! The service is always so fast even when it is packed.   Sometimes there is a short wait for a table as it can get very busy but this time we were sat right away. We ordered chicken Pho which comes with side plates of your standard bean shoots, jalapeños, lime, etc. They have hoisin sauce available as well.   The broth isn't the best I've had but still really good!   Be sure to check out the market it's attached to as it has so good deals on produce and other items you wouldn't find at other markets"}
{"text":"I love this place!!!!!! I get the S1!!!! It is so good!!!! I dream about this place!!!! They are quick too get you in and out! If you like PHO U have to try this place!"}
{"text":"By Far, Our Favorite Vietnamese Restaurant in East Valley. Service is fast, dependable, and restaurant is clean. Restrooms are clean, thank you. Food is outstanding."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed with this place. I'm sorry but why is this place still in business? First off, I walked in and the vibe was not friendly. The staff here honestly doesn't speak at all, not even basic etiquette...   I took a peek at the menu and I was very astonish at how much they charge for a bowl of slice beef pho. 9.95 is probably the most ridiculous price ever. If they are going to charge a ridiculous price for pho, at least make it good. Their pho is so horrible. The broth tasted old and it tasted like they pour chicken broth into their pho or something.. I also tried a little of my wife's dry noodles and I can't believe they call themselves a chef here. The noodles has no taste, the chicken was dry, the fish tasted old, and there was no sauce to the dry noodles...   Seriously that will be my last time there. 9.95 for a bowl of pho that's not even pho and the horrible service... no thank you...."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and first time every eating pho.  Restaurant was very clean. Staff was super nice and attentive without hovering wanting us to leave. The owner was so nice to chat with about his business. Will return."}
{"text":"My girlfiends have been saying they've been wanting to try pho forever! They finally decided to meet and up at unPhogettable so they could try pho and catch up on some needed girl time.   The ones who've never had pho of course ordered it and were very impressed with their dishes. Now, I've had pho before and I enjoy eatting it but my favorite dish off any Vietnamese menu is the bun, which is what I call a \"yummy meat and noodle salad.\" unPhogettable delivered on the \"yummy!\" I also ordered the shrimp summer rolls with their peanut sauce!  My favorite!  I hope to return to unPhogettable and try the pho when I'm in more of a soup mood! Yum!"}
{"text":"I really like this place! I tried their beef pho and it was amazing! I will recommend this place to anybody, try it!"}
{"text":"I love the name, but was the pho really unphogettable?  No.  Sorry.  Located in Mekong Plaza inside the supermarket, which can be crazy during the weekend, this is really a great location for a pho restaurant.  There are several LCDs for your viewing pleasure.  I really loved the painted bamboo murals on the walls and the contrasting taupe wall with some dark red in other areas.  The decor here is nice compared to other Vietnamese restaurants I've been to.  Very modern-esque.  Another plus, is the recess lighting over the tables which adds a better ambiance to the restaurant.  I am a fan of modernized restaurants especially Asian ones because back home, I'm accustomed to white walls and non-fancy decor.   But even with awesome decor and ambiance, the food was just ok.  I've had better and I think it's just gimmicky.    Food here is a bit pricier, but I guess that's what you're paying for."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is always top notch and the servings are large. Worth every penny. Friendly , helpful staff. I will continue frequenting this awesome restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, fair prices. As an Asian who lives in Arizona where it is hard to find authentic, quality Asian food, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This was always my to go place for pho. Especially when your hungover! The pho dac biet was always good and never disappointing. The broth was just right and you get a good amount of noodles and meat. But my favorite entrees would be bun bo hue or bun rieu. I can never get enough of having good spicy food. Although it wasn't as spicy as I wanted it to be. So I always ask for a side of chilli paste and extra peppers. The service was great and drinks were refill very quickly even when they are busy. If I'm ever back in Az  for whatever reasons again and I'm in need of pho I'll definitely be hitting this place up!"}
{"text":"Still keeping the rating the same, however I did try a rice plate here just out of curiosity and I wish I had the noodle soup instead. The portions were much smaller than I expected and the dish didn't include any fish sauce like most places, though I'm not sure if that's the norm here or not. Either way I will be back for the Pho."}
{"text":"I love, love, love coming to this place! It gives me the feeling of family and that's a great addition for any restaurant to have!  The soups have been great and they will work with you on your choices.  I don't know if anyone is aware of that, but it took some time and chatting with the sweet owner to discover this.  I love getting the soups with the soft tofu and minus any carrots and every time, its perfect.  The desserts are also awesome.  I love getting the red bean.  Its the right amount of beans with the sweet coconut milk...and makes me \"think\" that maybe this could be healthy.    I say, if you haven't tried out this wonderful place then do so and do it quickly and then sit back and enjoy!"}
{"text":"* sigh of relief *   THERE IS AUTHENTIC ASIAN FOOD IN THE VALLEY!  great service, good pho. the broth wasn't oily nor watered down. average pricing for a bowl of pho (8.25 for the special).  also ordered hieu tieu nam vang, my favorite soup dish. however it wasn't so great here; broth was bland, large serving.  salad rolls and peanut sauce are just like any other place, nothing special nor bad.   I LOOOOOOOOVED that they had disposable chopsticks and sauce dishes. very clean and inviting setting."}
{"text":"My husband loves pho, and since I had never tried it, we decided to give this place a try based on the reviews seen here on yelp. The restaurant was clean, and the service was great with highly attentive staff. We tried  the meatball and rare steak pho and were very impressed! The flavors were delicious and the meats were prepared wonderfully. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"unPhogettable was a great restaurant! I was particularly happy to see that they have three vegetarian dishes under a separate vegetarian menu heading. They can also make vegetarian pho with vegetable stock. They have vegetarian spring rolls and crispy spring rolls. I ordered the vegetarian flat noodles, my mother ordered the vegetarian pho, and my husband ordered the vermicelli noodles with shrimp. We got an order of vegetarian spring rolls to share. Everything was excellent! The owners were super friendly and the service was fast and courteous. I love the fact that they have various sauces and utensils at the table so that you can experiment with flavors without having to keep asking the waiter to bring you over some more sauce. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not the best Pho you can get, I'm Vietnamese so I had a lot of experience with Pho, this one not so much unless you're American only had Pho for a few times, in my opinion the broth is bland and this place is OVERPRICED for Pho. Yes that's right white folks y'all just got ripped off. I like the Bun Mam here the flavor is really good but for $10 the portion was way too small for the price. Giving this place a 3 stars for me is being generous."}
{"text":"Wonderful establishment. Great food, great authentic Vietnamese soft-drinks and deserts. And most of all, incredibly friendly, outgoing staff. In contrast to almost every other genuinely ethnic Asian restaurant, these people understand that a lot of white people are a little uncertain or inexperienced when it comes to Asian food. They guide you through the menu, answer all of your questions, and are very attentive and friendly. Wow, what a contrast to most Asian places I've been to! And because of this great service they have a huge non-Asian following. What a smart business model! The food is excellent: the rice noodle bowls, Pho (Vientamese beef or chicken soups), and fried rice dishes. They have great appetizers and one of the absolute best soft drinks which is an authentic beverage made of soda water, lime juice, ice and simple syrup. In just the right proportions, this drink is heaven. The bottom line, if you're one of those people who is curious about trying Vietnamese food, but feel a little awkward or intimidated, this is the place for you! In contrast, if you're an old hand who's powered through hundreds of noodle bowls, can pronounce all the dishes in their mother tongue, and are deft enough to catch flies with chop-sticks, this is still the place for you!!!"}
{"text":"Met up with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday, and was surprised to find out this place was here! Delicious pho soup, excellent service!  After dinner, we walked around and shopped at the Asian market attached to this little restaurant. All of the tea is here, people. Come get whatever is your favorite.  I've stopped here on the way home from work for dinner to go, several times since. Unphogettable. See what they did there?"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and it's literally my go-to place when I'm craving pho. The service is fast and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"A little more \"American\" than the Vietnamese places we usually go to but the food was very good and the staff was very friendly and attentive. The place is pretty and very clean. It's pricier than most Vietnamese restaurants and they have fewer options but would probably go there again."}
{"text":"Best pho in PHX hands down. #13 is my all time fave. the fresh rolls with shrimp and pork are also divine. they seat you quickly, serve your food within a few minutes of ordering, and send you on your way happy as can be.  unPhogettable.. that's what you areee."}
{"text":"My wife was feeling a bit queasy after shopping at the nearby grocery store.  So stopped in just for her to rest, but the manager seemed to notice she was feeling and uneasy and offered to make her something that will make her feel better.    He made her some sort of noodle dish that she loved.  I had the tendon pho and it was great.  We have liked this unPhogettable ever since."}
{"text":"My dinner partner has been mentioning this restaurant for several months. I think he was most taken by the catchy name. I was not particularly anxious to drive clear across the valley for dinner when I have three stalwart Vietnamese restaurants close by. But because I am a food adventurer I acquiesced to his repeated suggestion.  This diner (I will not describe it as a restaurant) is in a shopping center serving, what might be described as the Asian market, adjacent to an Asian/international supermarket.  It was clean and had a number of patrons. We were immediately greeted and seated. Our service throughout the evening was courteous and gracious.  I requested from our server than my order be the house specialty pho', which she identified as #1. I made a point of telling her that I consider the 'side vegetables' an important part of my meal and that I use/eat ALL my side produce (people who eat pho' know what I'm talking about).  When my dinner was served I had to stop myself from exclaiming out loud. The first thing out of my mouth was to tell my dinner companion that was the last meal I would have at 'Un pho gettable.'  The pho' is nearly twice the cost of all three locations in CenPho (central Phx). The dish of produce additives was so conservative that I still huff to think about it. And, the flavor (lack thereof) of the broth/meat was disappointing.  Service and cleanliness is very important, hence the three stars."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are addicted to this place! We come here up to three times a week and I find myself craving it on the days we can't make it here!! The chicken broth is the best I've ever had and the service is always wonderful, they have super motivated and attentive staff which I appreciate!"}
{"text":"my favorite place when I lived in Arizona and loved coming back to get my pho fix. portions are generous and the broth is very rich and flavorful!"}
{"text":"The spicer the better. Make sure to get the S1! I usually go for the P1 with the soft tendon, meatballs, tripe, lean brisket, and fatty brisket. Of all of the Pho restaurants that I have been to in Phoenix, I would say that this one is close to the top. Really accessable and easy to find and attached to a great international market. It has a laid back style to it and the waitstaff is very friendly.    A quick tip for any bowl of Pho that you get, order extra noodles on the side instead of another bowl if you are still hungry. It is a lot less expensive and gives you more to eat."}
{"text":"My favorite Pho place. The brisket is always tender and delicious and the service it fast. Seriously, sometimes it is like a Jimmy Johns commercial, we order our food and they bring it out a minute later. If you are new to pho or you aren't sure what you should put in your pho, just go with the brisket, you will love it. The only problem is the plaza that they are in can get busy and there will be no parking and 30 cars circling the parking lot. No restaurant is good enough to put up with that. It seems like half the time we go there we end up going somewhere else because there it no parking."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good. I dont like pho in general. I know, im a weirdo. I normally eat pho at home because in general i find pho broth at restaurants to be a bit too oily for my taste. Anyways this place is pretty good. $10 for a bowl is much too expensive for me though. Lived in the bay area and the size here would be considered a medium for $7 at most."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. I crave it all the time and it's hands down the best in the area. I drive 20 minutes just to eat the chicken pho! Veggies are always fresh and the soup is always amazing. I use so much hot chili paste that my broth turns red. I could eat this pho every  single day. YUM"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved eating at unPHÕgettable! This was one of my first experiences eating phõ, and I think the overall experience was great for a first- timer. The menu was very easy to read, and there is a variety of main ingredient dishes to chose from (chicken, beef, pork and vegetarian options like tofu). Minus one star because the service was ehh- the waitresses weren't exactly \"warm\" if you know what I mean. Overall, the food was ridiculously good. I would recommend this place to anyone eating to try phõ for the first time or to an experienced phõ eater."}
{"text":"Cool place by the market but let us be honest. The food is not good. The price is ridiculously expensive. I've been here couple times and I think i had enough experience with this place.  $12 for a simple bowl of super dry/chewy noodles with dry/tough microwaved(they called it grilled) pork. This is not an authentic Vietnamese restaurant at all. Or it is if you would consider it, but the taste of the food is so bad that make me think it is not. Two people come in and easily spend like above $30. Are you kidding me? With that money i think we can have much more better food with better service elsewhere. Just not worth it."}
{"text":"The owner is what makes this place POPPING! Down to earth people and no bs. I'm from California and I'm very meticulant on the type of pho I go to. This is by far THEE BEAT OR EVEN BETTER THEN CALIFORNIA! Try this out .   The only negatives is probably that it gets busy at night...they probably need to make it bigger!!"}
{"text":"Thanks for the good reviews.  It helped me decide between several different Vietnamese restaurants in Chandler.   Great food.  Great Pho.  Clean.  Everything was well presented."}
{"text":"pros... 1.  the veg are fresh 2.  the restaurant is clean.  love it.  must give the owner a 5 stars on cleanliness of the place, even the sauces on the table (covers were not covered w/spilled sauces). 3.  convenient  cons... 1.  expensive 2.  service is very slow (you will be frustrated if you are hungry).  we went there 4 times and it average about 20 minutes for the 1st order to come and there was a time the 2nd bowl of noodles takes another 20 minutes. 3.  the beef in the beef noodles are lean meat.  I prefer fatty beef when I eat Vietnamese noodles just like how they do it in Chicago or LA."}
{"text":"After taking a break from going here a long while ago due to a very bad service, here I am again and I am so excited about how big of a change of unPhogettable. The restaurant is crowded when I walk in, but I get greeted right away with a very prudent manner by a friendly server.   I have dined in at numerous places and I still favor the ones that make me feel warm, welcomed, that my business is greatly appreciate and you, unPhogettable, you have done that for me, so I thank you!  About the food, I order Pho as always to determine if there is any adjustments in the quality, and I have to say the smell and the flavorful favor say it all! I really dig the Pho, but comparing to other places, the Pho in this place is not my favorite. However, I will definitely come back here and there to try out other items on the menu as well."}
{"text":"Oh, I hesitated before we entered this what seems to be a pretty highly rated yelp restaurant...  The only reason for 2 stars instead of a one  is a super friendly service. Our waiters were excellent, very helpful and accommodating. It is absolutely not their fault that food is mediocre. Actually, what was strange is that they charged our CC just the amount on the bill and did not include the tip my husband left. Bill was $26.40, my husband signed for $31, but online I see a charge of $26.40 only.  I don't know if I should call and make sure that waiters got their tip... I guess, I will do it on Monday.  We ordered pho chin ( well done brisket ). The broth was good, but nothing spectacular, brisket itself was still pretty chewy and tasteless. I expected it to be at least a little bit better, but if you are hungry and want something hot, go for it. The portion is very generous.  Vegetable Cha Gio (Fried Vietnamese egg rolls) was completely soaked in some oil, which totally ruined the dish. It looked like their fryer was not hot enough when they dipped rolls for cooking. Another possibility is that oil was old. Neither of the scenarios excites me.  Vermicelli with seasoned grilled shrimps disappointed as well. There were only 5 tiny shrimps on the top, pretty rubbery but tasty. The rest seemed to be 2 pounds of vermicelli.  I don't know what everyone else with 5 star reviews ate there, but whatever we had was not that. I don't mind cheap, ethnic food, and I know that it can be inexpensive but still very good.   I will not repeat, but I encourage you to try. Maybe, it was a bad day and you will get something better. Again, the service is very friendly, I kind of feel bad leaving such a negative review, but I cannot lie and led other people believe that the food was good."}
{"text":"The Pho was not the best and it's expensive. I paid $33 for two bowls of pho and some egg rolls."}
{"text":"This is the best pho I have had since moving from California to Arizona. Although I've had some awkward situations with the customer service there, I have never had a bad meal. They have all your typical pho soups for about $9/bowl, but they also have more unusual types from different parts of Vietnam which I appreciate and have not been brave enough to try. I like to stick to my brisket and tendon pho and fresh spring rolls... but I'll be a bit more adventurous soon :)"}
{"text":"I've been going to unphogettable for about 5 years and in those 5 years their pho taste the same . It's consistent and taste great to me ! I always get a bowl of soup and a side of spring rolls . Delicious!! I was also very happy to find out that they have a kids menu. When I first started coming here I didn't have any kids but now I do and it makes it a lot easier than sharing my pho or ordering another and not being able to finish it . The only reason why I'm not giving 5 stars is because sometimes they don't really have great customer service skills . They don't say much to you and point at where you need to sit .  I always recommend this restaurant to people and I probably always will ."}
{"text":"This place deserves its name. The pho was as good as any I had elsewhere and the springrolls, both fried and raw, were delightful. The employees seemed overworked and nonchalant, however. I almost gave this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Amazing, I've been there several times. I usually get the #9 Pho w/ brisket & tenderloin and the egg rolls.  The broth is slow cooked daily. The herbs are fresh and the pho is delicious.  The staff is very friendly and attentive.  I live several miles away but it's worth the trip even though there are several pho restaurants along the way.  Plus there is a great bakery and market nearby to walk around after dinner. They also have delicious tea (hot or iced) which is a nice break from the usual soda pop."}
{"text":"unPHOgettable is quite PHOnomenal For being Asian, service is remarkable Get filled up for less than ga$ in your abdominal No MSG, no trans-fat makes it responsible  Summer rolls and pork taste so verrry nice  Add some Sriracha and chili for that extra spice Oh! Love me long time, I need more rice! If ya don't have yellow fever, you'll be enticed  Even my round-eye BF began to slant Clapping his hands in a chant Tried ordering more, though his pants can't Calm down cracker, no need to take a chance On a food coma, me want some late night romance  Being Vietnamese, I'm keeping it PHO-real Eat here for an authentic PHO-bulous meal Situated next to an Asian market  For that trustworthy PHO-king feel  PHO-shizzle, PHO-sho, this ain't no faux-Pho"}
{"text":"Had the Pho Tai there.  Service wasn't bad, but the food was overpriced and medicore.  You're better off going somewhere else nearby like Khai Hoan or Pho Thanh."}
{"text":"Sorry but why do people like this place ? They have great reviews but the people who like this are people who don't know what good pho is . Growing up Vietnamese and eating pho this place just isn't good . The soup isn't flavorful which means I have to had extra hoisin and sirracha to it . The price is a little bit expensive compared to other pho places who have the best pho ever and give bigger portions . Like common people get out more and try other places!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a very clean joint with good service.  The portions aren't huge but the owners care about how their food is prepared and presented.  I totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"Even in this heat I'd eat Pho. The tofu veggie spring rolls (not fried) were delicious and so was the peanut sauce they came with. Had the beef base Pho with brisket and steak. The meat was pretty good quality and the beef broth was good. I would come back here when coming back to the Mesa/Tempe area."}
{"text":"Soo good, cheap, and good for kids. I got my two little boys grilled chicken and beef with a side of white rice."}
{"text":"Excellent Pho. One of the best I've had. The broth is very flavorful. I had the steak pho and shrimp spring rolls. Both were great. Passes the come again test."}
{"text":"Super bomb! From the egg rolls to the fried rice with shrimp/pork to the beef pho! Everything was soooo delicious and fresh! Id definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Favorite place to eat at when i go to the Asian market. I know theres others places but i love eating here. My bf and i usually share our pho because the portion of pho are so huge. We usually get the rare beef, I've had the chicken before but for new guest get the rare beef it taste better and has less ginger. The price is a little experience for pho but like i said the portions are big."}
{"text":"Long time returning customer! This is a great place to eat and the people are extremely nice"}
{"text":"It was worth the drive. This place was clean and the service was excellent. Ordered Bun Rieu and it was one of the best."}
{"text":"Okay, I know that anyone checking my profile is going to see a bunch of 5-star reviews...I'm just starting with the places I LOVE (I'll get around to places I don't...later...if I feel like revisiting poor experiences).  UnPhogettable definitely fits this description, hands-down my favorite pho place EVER.  The menu is big, a really nice selection, but I have to admit that, despite visiting every couple weeks, I continue to order the same thing...the sliced pork bun with egg rolls is just TOO GOOD to pass up.  It's a wonderful cross between a hot rice noodle dish and a salad: fresh, refreshing, satisfying and flavorful.  The quality is typical of the rest of the menu...this place is consistent and reliable.  The portions are perfect...for two meals!  (I've discovered that most reheat well for lunch the next day).  I have almost finished the bun once, an accomplishment I am truly proud of.  The atmosphere is really friendly...hip and modern-trendy, with informal seating at long tables, very relaxed.  The restaurant is very clean, and is a part of the Mekong Plaza shopping complex...so you've got an awesome Asian market to roam through after lunch.  The staff are very attentive, and the owners are FANTASTIC - super-friendly, great sense of humor, and even remember my favorite order (which is pretty good with the number of customers they get!).  I never can believe the check when it comes, either...incredible amount of food for the price.  If you like pho and bun, this place will compare favorably with anything you've had anywhere else.  IF YOU'VE NEVER HAD IT, are you in for a treat!  Give this a shot, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Love the pho. Again just wished these asian restaurants would be more attentive with their customers drinks haha"}
{"text":"The terrible experience here was really unPhogettable. They should be honored that I'm not allowed to give them zero stars. The table wasn't sanitized properly seeing as there are brown, sticky spots that I accidentally put my arm upon. The poor costumer service wasn't really something that bother because I rather prioritize the quality of the food instead. I ordered the typical pho. The broth was flavorful, sadly that's the only good thing about it. The meat was a disappointment, rubbery, and old. Almost like it has been sitting in the freezer for 5 years before being finally served to unfortunate customers. The texture of the noodles felt like plastic. It's sad that this place receives such praising reviews yet I didn't get to experience myself."}
{"text":"I've been to this pho spot a fee times for lunch and it never disappoints. It's usually busy, but the service is fast efficient and friendly. There are lots of community tables to sit at when you walk in. This makes for a kinda noisy restaurant but I certainly don't mind it at all. There are some smaller tables available as well. From the outside it's a strip mall but the decor inside is quite nice and not what you would expect!  The menu has a good selection of a variety of Pho, egg noodle and regional soups, vermicelli salads, entrees and appetizers. I've had the summer and autumn rolls with peanut sauce and they are fresh, crisp and delish every time. They are filled just right, not too much yet not to skimpy. The veggies and meats taste like they had just been put together, which is just as it should be. While I don't like too much peanut sauce, I do like it here as it's not too sticky and sweet. I've also tried the pho and it is great! While they are very flexible and offer a variety of ingredients for the pho it is the broth that really stands out. It's savory and well balanced, you can taste the beef and spices and it's wonderful. I love love the lingering star anise taste in every spoonful.  Know that you can pick up take out here and they package it very very well!"}
{"text":"I went during lunch time and it wasn't super busy yet. The parking situation for this side of the plaza is horrible since its near phoenix palace which caters to huge parties and family functions so expect to park a little far if you don't want to dance around other cars getting in and out. I got a dac biet and the broth itself was a little sweet for my taste but the rest of the bowl was pretty solid as far as the meat goes. I gave them an extra star since everyone gets an individual veggie plate! We all know how weird it is to ration veggies when you go to a pho place."}
{"text":"Another good stop in Mekong Plaza.  Friendly and efficient service.  The servers always take the time to explain each dish, and are genuinely concerned that you get exactly what you want.  Very fresh ingredients make for great pho, and you will find it here."}
{"text":"I enjoy my meal every time I'm here. I ordered the vegetable fried spring rolls and the #21 Pho which has chicken based broth and seafood. It was delicious. It took a while for my spring rolls to come out, so I rushed to eat them so I could enjoy my Pho while it was steaming hot!"}
{"text":"I had the #1.  It was pretty tasty.  The broth could have used more flavor.  Overall it was good.  3 stars because it was $8.50 for a normal size bowl which was still a bit small compared to others.  Where I'm from its $5-6 for a regular and $6-7 for a large bowl.  I paid $10 after tax and tip.  That is ridicules for a bowl of pho.  Apparently the owner said they use all natural ingredients.  I really don't care and I probably won't go back unless if they drop their prices."}
{"text":"This place is part of an Asian mini-mall.  It's awesome.   This was a very clean, modern-looking place.  It wasn't very crowded on a Wednesday afternoon.  Parking was easy.  The staff greeted me as soon as I walked in.  I had a seat and got to ordering...a #9 (rare steak and brisket pho).  It was about $7.50.   I received my food about five minutes later.  Loved it.  Packed with flavor, unlike some of the previous reviews have mentioned.  The woman came over and told me to mix some of the hoisin sauce with some of the hot sauce and lime juice.  I tried her suggestion and dipped the meat into it - man, how awesome this stuff was...  She also mentioned they do not use MSG.    I'd hit this place up again in a heartbeat for some of the best pho ever!"}
{"text":"One of the Best if not THE BEST places in the Valley to have Pho.  #15 Chicken Pho is my favorite.  I don't go out to eat for lunch with my co-workers often, but when I do, I always vote for coming here.  The staff is friendly and the service is great.  The food is the icing on the cake and it's superb!  I highly recommend this place, it's Yummy!"}
{"text":"I rarely give places one star, but I guess there truly is a first for everything. I was out in Arizona for the first time, craving Vietnamese food and my friend took me here! The name really hooked me in, it's so catchy and punny- I am all about the puns.   But I was truly disappointed throughout my meal. Staff overall were not very friendly or unattentive, despite the fact that the restaurant was not busy at all. My friends all ordered the Pho - which they said was adequate. I was feeling different and decided to order my favorite, banh canh cua. Now this dish is not very hard to mess up, but when the bowl came out - it was ALL broth. A huge bowl of broth, with sunken mini pile of noodles, one small piece of pork and two shrimp. This was IT! For the description on the menu, something along the lines of seafood soup with vietnamese udon....this was hardly fitting.   I figured, okay maybe the portions are just small. I took my first sip of the broth, and already my experience continued to get worse. The broth was practically hot WATER. Pretty tasteless, no flavor besides the fact that it was red color, I wonder where they got that from since it did not taste like anything. There were kinda floating tiny pieces of crab throughout the broth but they were so small, you barely had any. I'm midway through my soup, forcing myself to eat it since I was starving...and then I found a PIECE OF PLASTIC in the soup. Clear plastic, a piece as big as my finger....wonder how they were able to miss that putting in my bowl but also shame on me for eating half my bowl and not realizing it. Maybe because all they gave me was broth, and it was just lost in this soup.   I ordered some summer rolls to go in case I got hungry, since I did not have much for lunch. And those were even more disappointing than the soup if you can imagine that. Peanut sauce tasted like they just stirred some peanut butter together and put it in a cup. The roll was hard, and chewy beyond measure. It was tough, and the noodles wrapped inside were definitely not cooked all the way. Meat inside the roll was tough. The whole roll was tough - TOUGH TO EAT!!   Did not enjoy this place, and to say the least - this restaurant was definitely unPHOgettable for me -________-"}
{"text":"This is the best place in town to get good Pho'. The broth is very flavorful and full of noodles and all the goodies you can pile on.  The special fried rice is delish with little tiny squares of ham in there you pick up with your chopsticks.  Taste like candy!!  Prices are fair for a gigantic bowl of soup that tastes good and is very healthy.  I always take my leftovers home for lunch the next day!  When you are done eating here stroll through the Mekong Market for a tour of Vietnam!  Then go to Aoozy bakery right next door and get a bag or nine of the almond crisps!  They are quite delightful!  I love this place!"}
{"text":"The best pho ga ive had. they cook their broth something insane like 24 hours and you can tell. the service is super friendly and you can tell the family owned store has a passion for vietnamese cuisine. the bakery beside is a good place for dessert after, too."}
{"text":"Pretty good pho for the Mesa area, the pho I think had a hint of MSG, but overall well cooked noodles, good beef slices, fast and nice service, clean, and good portions. Prices are more than I expected for the Mesa area, but not unreasonable."}
{"text":"Their pho is the worst I had in the az area.  with respect to the other rave review, their only saving grace is good service, esp for people who had not had vietnamese food before, as their servers do speak better english and because they are not crowded usually, they would have more time and patience to explain the food to you.    The reason why they are not crowded is because they are located in a vietnamese/asian centric mall with large crowds of asians shopping for food and groceries at the mekong supermarket, and they know a good pho from a bad one.  Trust me I am asian :)     Going here would be like a vegetarian going to texas roadhouse and having them cook up a steak and try to explain to you the fine art of grilling aged beef.    If you are at the Mekong plaza area, and U need some vietnamese food, go to the other vietnamese restaurant that is directly across from them, I can't recall the name, but they have a large menu full of rice dishes and stuff.  U can order like noodle items too, I love their dry house special noodles there.    If you are new to vietnamese food and would like an intro, I guess this place might work, so 1 star for that.  there are a lot of other places U can go to like Khai Hoang, Dat Vang or even Saigon."}
{"text":"I am a Pho enthusiast, and I must say that this is one of the best Pho I have ever tried.  The prices are comparable to similar restaurants but the quality, service and cleanliness are outstanding.  Every single time that my family and I have been to this restaurant, the owner and sometimes his lovely wife is there to greet us.   I visit this restaurant at least once a month, and every time has been an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, CLEAN, very enjoyable! Right in same plaza as great shopping too, a bonus!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. We came here weekly. Now a days not so much, you see the last couple times I've shown up 45 minutes before closing (1st time) then an hour and fifteen minutes (2nd time) they've told me they were closed. Kind of bullshit to have a different time listed on your door if you ask me! Anyways, decent for pho. That's all I recommend there though."}
{"text":"First time I ever tried pho in my life. I came here with a group of four friends and had a good time. The servers were really nice and frequently checked on us at our table. They were also happy to teach us what the name of the dishes were. I definitely will stop by again in the near future."}
{"text":"I keep coming back because their food is great and they are possibly the nicest restaurant owners I have ever met.  I wish it were closer to our house, but its worth the drive."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. Vegan menu options are awesome, food is fantastic and staff is always welcoming and friendly. We literally eat here 2 or 3 times a month."}
{"text":"I'm from Central California and this Phò place is not bad compares to the ones I been to. They are still flavorful and delicious. However they do need a few more side ingredient and it will be amazingly awesome! But I definitely recommend this place to eat delicious phò!"}
{"text":"Hands down...the best Pho in the valley. My GF and I ate here today for the first time and loved it. The owners came out to greet us and welcome us to their establishment for the first time. She explained how the beef broth is simmered for 24 hours and the chicken broth simmers for 12. What a great selling point. The Pho was great. It was fresh and the broth was amazing. Crisp clean taste with crisp clean flavors. The portions are large and we have plenty to take home. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 6 stars.   We purchased the Groupon and went on the same night to unPhogettable.  By 6PM, this place was boomin.    We ordered the soft summer rolls (pork sausage), #8 (Pho with brisket and flank) and the #48 (steamed rice with seasoned grilled sliced beef).   The summer rolls were very good and came with a delish house sauce.  We hadn't received our dinners yet when a server came over and asked if we had the Groupon.  We said yes, and she explained that they couldn't accept it until the next day.  We hadn't read that on the deal, so I was a little frustrated (not mad, but just like, 'dangit!').  The owner stopped by and we talked to him for a few minutes.  We looked at our Groupon and saw that it DID say it couldn't be used until the next day.  So it was totally our over-sight.    He explained that a few tables had gotten mad and walked out, and they only did the Groupon to get new people to try their restaurant since June is the quietest month for most restaurants in the valley.  We told him that we didn't care about the Groupon, and were there for the food not the deal.  We decided we would just use the Groupon the next weekend.   Needless to say, he was very excited and grateful. I think we were more excited about our dinners though.    When our meals came out, he showed us the Vietnamese way to eat Pho and the rice and meat plate.  That was really cool.  It was obvious that he took great pride in his restaurant and food, and wanted to make sure everyone was happy.   I can't explain how amazing the food was. The #48 came with a broth on the side that you eat first to cleanse your palate.  I could have just eaten that as my meal and been totally satisfied.  The sauce on the beef was hard to explain.  It was slightly sweet, but had a lot of depth.  I was reluctant to share.   The Pho broth was fantastic.  After all of the noodles, meat and bean sprouts were gone, and we were both stuffed, I couldn't stop sipping the broth.  Seriously. It was so good, I didn't mind over-stuffing myself.   We said we would be back next weekend.  I don't think I can wait that long."}
{"text":"They have vegetarain pho! So many vegetables, tofu, and broth. It warms my soul :). I will come back again for it! There are other vegetarian items if you are not interested in pho.    Here are some vegetarian items: - Sautee seasonal vegetable with rice - Vegetarian fried rice - Wide noodle wok fried with vegatables - Vegetarian noodle soup - Vegetarian eggroll salad"}
{"text":"I had the pho with brisket and rare steak and it was good. Very flavorful and good size of a bowl. My wife had vermicelli with pork and that was really, really delicious. It was good overall, but next time I'm at Mekong Plaza, I'll probably give it a shot to the other restaurants just to compare."}
{"text":"Love this place! I am a huge fan of the # 9 but my new fav is #24. This place is very clean and always full of customers. They keep the A/C on and it's nice and cool just like it should be in the summertime. The employees here are awesome too. Always very nice and seem to remember everyone! That's the kind of restaurant I love!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous pho!   The owner Chan was very nice and informative (I brought a first timer!). And dorothy n other servers were so nice and helpful!  cant wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here today with co workers and it was absolutely delicious! Cannot wait to go back gain."}
{"text":"Pho is good here as it should be, hence the name. The broth had really good flavor and wasn't overly salty nor oily. The veggies that accompanied it was fresh and crisp. This place is extremely clean. I really like the disposable chopsticks and sauce cups at each table. Rice plates are okay - I prefer the place across for rice plates.   Very good service. The owner was charming and pleasant. Price was a couple bucks more than the average pho joint but nothing outrageous."}
{"text":"Best Pho around! Not greasy like a lot of places. Spring rolls are awesome and so are entrees. My family and I have been coming here since the Mekong plaza opened. The owner is sooooo nice. The staff is always friendly as well. The restaurant is clean and prices are reasonable. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great day pho soup!  I've been wanting to try this place inside Mekong Plaza.  I ordered the Seafood Chicken based Rice Noodle Pho with a side order of egg roll that my son and I shared.  The soup had a couple of small shrimp, a couple small pieces of squid and two split tiny shrimp balls.  Although, the broth was very tastey, I didn't think it was worth $8.50.  Nothing special about the eggroll.    Hubby ordered the curry based beef soup.  It was more or less stewed beef peppered with pho spices.  A little lackluster for my taste.  The price is a little more than what I wanted to pay for a so-so pho.  There are 3 or 4 choices of soup on the KID'S MENU.  The service was excellent!  We'll go back to try other entrees on their menu."}
{"text":"Very good pho.  We also tried the bun which is like pho without the broth?  (That's the best i can describe it.)  We always get spring rolls with our meals and it is refreshing.    The service is great!  I always judge how well they are doing by my drink. If it never gets half full they are great.  It's not often servers are on it like here.  Definitely a 5 star for service.    I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I really like the food here and service is usually pretty good. The last time, our waitresses were non vietnamese who had ridiculously long acrylic nails on, it personally grossed me out a bit as it appears a bit unprofessionsl but they don't touch the food so I guess it doesn't matter. It is just weird to see non asian people working in an asian restaurant. The spring rolls are pretty average but sauce is different with a coconut flavor."}
{"text":"Had a great time here! The staff was great, service was good (even in a holiday rush), and the food was top notch! Couldn't have asked for a better lunch :)"}
{"text":"Always a great time here.  Today I opted for the wonton soup.  I think it's the best in the valley with fresh wontons, a great broth, and little pieces of shrimp and fish cake in there.  The BBQ pork also adds to the flavor.  This place never dissapoints."}
{"text":"Another decent Pho place in the greater Phoenix area. This one is very clean and nicely decorated.  Staff is very friendly.  Pho and spring rolls are delicious. Price is a little more expensive compared to other pho places. But you do get a lot of food here."}
{"text":"My family came here and ate when they visited me once--the food is good, although nothing extraordinary. It was slightly more expensive than what I am used to."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some great Pho, this is definitely a place to check out.  It's located right dab in a Vietnamese shopping center, how can you really go wrong?    I ordered the Viet iced tea with cream which was a lot less sweet than the Thai teas I'm used to, it was surprising but still very delicious.  The appetizer ordered was the Summer Rolls which house a large hunk of spicy sausage in it, the sauce to dip it in was really sweet and didn't cling to the roll well, I think I'd rather have had hoisin sauce with it.  I ordered the white meat combo noodle soup bowl.  This consisted of a couple of pieces of imitation crab, fish cake balls, shrimp, pork slices and calamari.  Each was quite good in its own right except the imitation crap which had started to flake and come apart in the hot broth.  The broth by the way was fabulous, didn't overpower the meats but added enough flavor to them, much like a fondue broth, while still more than delicious enough to slurp the rest of the way through once all the solid bits were gone.  The reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is even after showing we've been around the block with Vietnamese food we were constantly being given instructions on what was good and what newcomers to Vietnamese cuisine should try.  I mean once is good service, but after the customer replies that they've had it before don't continue to treat them like newbie white devils...some of us are a little more travelled than others, thanks."}
{"text":"One of the better place for Vietnamese cuisine. The spring rolls are made fresh with each order and the sauce is nutty to the taste. Try the Pho, taste as it was like in Vietnam. Authentic Vietnamese dishes.   This restaurant is next to the main entrance of a Asian strip mall. Parking is free but expect large crowds exotically on a weekend. Place is clean and come early, as there might be a long line waiting for tables.   There is an Asian market too, for those who like to get groceries after a meal."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not amazing. I came here with my husband and were seated right away. They had a large menu, but only one vegetarian option. It was $10 or $11 and only had a very small amount of tofu. The taste was good and I was full, but we ended up only getting two bowls of soup, one drink and it was $35. Very pricey and not great."}
{"text":"We read about this place on yelp and we're excited to go try it. But we won't be going back. We were sat quickly but asked if we would share a table. Which wasn't a huge deal. We were asked by two different servers if we were ready to order. We ordered with the second server. 35 min later we had to ask about our food. 5 min later we were notified that our order had been \"lost\" . I explained to the server that we were not going to wait. She looked confused about why we wanted to leave. Bummer that we didn't get to eat!"}
{"text":"Delicious pho, spring rolls, and peanut dipping sauce."}
{"text":"I can not say enouph good things about this place. The first time we walked in, the owner greeted us like we had stepped into his living room. I am pho phonatic, so I knew what to order, but my friends were still getting used to the pronunicaiton. The owner dove into the menu, explaining that he liked to educate his customers so we knew exactly what we were getting. That personal touch won me over immediately.  Then the pho came out. I don't exaggerate when I say it was the best I've had in a while. It might have been because of the fresh ingredients the owner told us about, or the good ratio of broth-to-meat-to-veggies, but either way it was delicious. The egg rolls were also tasty, but I just wish we were served more (that's more of a comment on my appetite).  I've been back several times, and unPhogettable does not dissapoint. Also, check out the massive Asian grocery store attached. If you want alcohol, you're allowed to buy some there and bring it in. Bonus points!"}
{"text":"Good pho if you like your soup base light and fragrant. If you're looking for something brothier and sweeter, look elsewhere. Also i've noticed that their noodles seem fresher than at other places. Might be because they're right next to an Asian grocery store..."}
{"text":"Before unPhoegettable I had never tasted vietnamese food, after trying pho for the first time I automatically fell in love with it and added to my faves. I've tried other restaurants that serve pho, from holes in the wall to fancy places and nothing still nothing compares to this place. The crispy pork rolls are out of this world. Service can be better thats why I gave it four stars. To make this review simple...this place is unpho-king-believable."}
{"text":"If you frequent Mekong plaza, then you have probably seen unPhogettable on your way in. unPhogettable is a great place for Pho. I am a big fan of noodle soups and I loved the vegetarian Pho. The service was friendly and the overall experience was very nice."}
{"text":"Love this place! We always order the childrens pho thai and egg roles.  This is the perfect amount of food and the taste is amazing.   They use filtered water, your water glass in never empty, and the employees always give amazing service.   One of my favorites is the iced coffee as it is so refreshing.  If you want a great value, check them out and then go next door to the bakery for a treat."}
{"text":"Yep, this place is a winner.  I've been here twice, and left happy both times.  I love that they have vegetarian pho (with tofu and veggies instead of meat) and the service is incredible - you can tell they really love their business and their customers.  I will absolutely be stopping here whenever I'm in the area.  FYI, they don't serve beer/booze, but you can buy it in the market next door and bring it in!"}
{"text":"My friend Steve turned me on to this place over a year ago, and Chan's unPhogettable is, for me, the final word on Pho in the valley.  The portions are incredible, the staff is so warm and friendly, and the Mekong Market is always a fun place to shop after an extremely satisfying meal.   Tip: TRY THE VIETNAMESE ICED COFFEE. There's a ritual to it, which is half the fun. The other half is DELICIOUS ICED COFFEE."}
{"text":"My favorite pho broth around!  Nice portions, good prices.  The staff treats you like family!  They are really just about the nicest people I've ever met at a restaurant.   I like their spring rolls, but I like the ones at Pho Ao Sen better (especially the peanut sauce there).  But this is my favorite place for pho.  It never lets me down and is always worth the drive.  The fifth star was given because I really feel like family when I'm there."}
{"text":"Welcoming and timely service.   Clean and well-run.  To someone who has spent many hours consuming pho in the hidden corners of Little Saigon in the OC - this was a very pleasant surprise.  Clientele was solid mix of gringos and asians.  Phood was 3.5 stars.  Disappointed in our $5.75 spring rolls - which were 'stuffed' mostly with rice noodles and razor thin slices of sausage.  But on the plus side the menu includes a whole page of interesting 'regional' noodle soups - so there are some off the beaten path options if you want to stray from the pho options.  Plenty of sprouts and leaves served alongside - most noodle soups in the $9-$10 range.  Prices about 15% above where they should be - but for such a pleasant and friendly environment it's worth the extra few bucks.  Note hot tea here is $1.95...  Would have assigned 3 stars purely on phood and prices - but great,friendly staff and service make this a 4 star review."}
{"text":"This place is unforgettable aright, I'm from Orange County an boi customer service is awesome  here. About the food well I order #2  pho bowl with magical stuff. Soup had alot of flavor meat was well cook. appetizer dish was little disappointed. Deep fried  egg rolls were little blaa, spring roll wasn't  spring at all super dry... won't stop me from coming here and trying other things"}
{"text":"So many options and love the easy to read menu. Very simple place but great food! They even have simple options for kids which is a plus. Must try spring rolls!"}
{"text":"I've been trying to look for a suitable substitute for pho here, since I eat it back home all the time. Compared to all the other places in the pheonix/glendale area I've been to, this is probably the best pho place and it's about 30 min from where I live.   It's not as good as the pho in the bay area, but it tastes close enough. The servers are really nice and the restaurant is clean which is a plus, since most pho places that taste really good are kind of dirty, and mom and pop-like, similar in Vietnam.   Since I'm vietnamese, it works in my favor ( I feel like I get more food and more quickly too). We came in a huge group and they reserved a table for us (unlike most vietnamese places which get you in and out as quickly as possible!) Most of us got pho, we shared spring rolls, and some others got bbq rice plates and bun bo hue (Spicy beef noodle). They even brought out the special onions to put in the pho (by request only). I think some got the special desserts and liked them as well. We all left really happy and most of us are from california so we know what good pho is ;)"}
{"text":"PHO EVA!!!   This is my new spot, its clean and the customer service is a ten. There are tons of places to eat at the Mekong Plaza and I have tried a few but so far this little spot of paradise is THE best. Two thumbs up and a cheesy smile"}
{"text":"Great pho soup and spring rolls. The food tastes fresh and everyone wins because you not get to eat fresh but you don't burn your wallet doing it. Jasmine tea is amazing as well!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Truly some of the best pho I have had. I always want to try something else on the menu because it looks so good but I always end up with the pho because it's so darn good.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"pretty good but a bit pricey but Im spoiled living here in Northern California!!"}
{"text":"I went here with a group of 11 people yesterday for our monthly Vietnamese work lunch.  The short version of why I gave the low review was because the server was rude, and the food wasn't tasty. (Comparing to other pho places in the area, not homemade.) The positives are that the manager is nice; the decor is really nice as well, and the presentation of food is beautiful.  Long Version: Our group came into the restaurant at around 11:20 am yesterday. We were making our orders, and I ordered in English. Then, my co-workers told me I should order in Vietnamese to practice speaking. I awkwardly ordered in Vietnamese and asked for the pork bun and egg rolls with a bowl of pho broth. (In Vietnamese, there are two words for \"bowl\". A large bowl and a small bowl.) When I first ordered in English, I asked for a side bowl of broth. When I ordered in Vietnamese, I asked for a big bowl of broth. I cupped my hands in a small bowl gesture. While the server was standing there, my co-worker said in Vietnamese, \"Make sure you say (small) bowl, not (big) bowl.\"   The food came out, and I saw this HUGE bowl of pho broth, and thought to myself, \"Wow, these people are really generous with the side broth.\" I seriously got excited and snapchatted about it. And at this point, the manager comes by and asked us if everything is good, and we said we were good.  I eat the pork bun, and honestly it's not that bad, but the meat is pounded really thinly. Probably around ~1 and 1/2mm for each slice. The volume looks like a lot, but the mass of the actual meat is very little. You're looking at about 10% meat/egg roll, 40% noodles, and 50% vegetables. Also, it was really, really dry--similar to eating beef jerky with a little bit of sauce splashed on it. However, I tasted the chicken version of the dish, and it was moist and a lot more tasty. I also tasted my co-workers bun bo hue, and I recommend getting that dish over the pho here.   I started sipping on the pho, and it wasn't that bad. It probably tastes a little more watered down than what people are used to. But if you're the kind of person who uses a lot of hoisin, sriracha, and lime juice, I think you will like it.   As I was eating the pho, I noticed my friend's small side of pho broth, and I was like, \"Wait. What the heck?\" And he said, \"Yeah, this is free, and yours is probably not.\" Then I was wondering if they were going to charge me a lot for the broth.   Later, we went to go pay, and the girl who took my order was also the person at the register. She charged me $4 for the pho broth, and then I said, \"Oh..I said I wanted a small bowl.\" She shrugged and said, \"It'll be $18.85.\" I was like, \"What the heck.\" She talks to my other co-workers in Vietnamese, and then says the cost of my bill in English. I think she definitely knew that I wanted a side broth because I ordered a entree already. And I feel like if she knew my Vietnamese was bad and says my bill in English, why not use my English order instead of my Vietnamese one? Honestly, I'm partially at fault for saying big bowl, but she didn't clarify after I said side broth in English in the beginning.   Come on, man. Why are you so mean.  I got annoyed and told my co-workers about how I thought the server was rude. And one of them jokingly said, \"Well, you said (big) bowl.\" But the others agreed that she most likely knew what I meant. -__- Later, my friend told me that while she was taking my order, she was rolling her eyes as I was talking.   You should try it out if you want to give newer pho restaurants a try or are introducing people who normally don't eat Vietnamese food. I think the presentation of the food and the decor will impress them. Just don't order in Vietnamese to the girl with the glasses who looks like she's being forced to work there. You will probably piss her off, and she will probably get petty. I wanted to give the restaurant a three star review, but my co-workers told me to leave them a one star review, so I met in the middle.  They could have been having a bad day, but I think that new Vietnamese restaurants should have nice servers and really delicious food when they first open. Also, it seems like the other location in Mesa has better reviews, so I would probably go over there instead. But I'm just a random person on the internet who had a bad experience."}
{"text":"This place is awesome from the pho to the amazing customer service. The pho is wonderful with great flavors, plenty of aromatics, and good meat. The broth is a bit spicer than most pho places but I really like it. Plus the price and portion size is great. The only thing preventing this from being 5 stars is that I wasn't a fan of the Thai iced tea with shaved ice in it and or wasn't a strong enough flavor for me.   The customer service is great very helpful, attentive and get your food quickly. The owner is also a very nice guy who talks to everyone making sure things are enjoyable. What really stood out is that after going in once he remembered me and that we had talked about yelp. It was only a minute or two conversation but when I came in a week or so later he remembered. That is just unbeatable when it comes to remembering customers and showing appreciation towards them.   This is a place I will be coming to again and again"}
{"text":"Ordered the mi vit tiem (duck soup) and there was a piece of hair in it. Reordered the bun tom nuong (vermicelli w/ grilled shrimp) there was way too much vermicelli, not enough grilled shrimp or sauce. The staffs are nice. Overall not the best experience.."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly service. I've seen cheaper pho, but I felt it was a good value because of the portions and how tasty it was. Things were maybe just a bit on the sweet side. I'd come back."}
{"text":"So I have never tried Pho before and my friend and I went to try this restaurant. He has already had it and he loves it and said that i absolutely needed to try it:)   We went and it was super packed! We went on a Sunday night. It was very lively.   We decided to get the veggie pho with tofo in it. We saw from the reviews that the portions are generous and we don't eat too much food at once, so we decided to split it.  and it was definitely more than enough! We also ordered the shrimp and pork spring rolls as an appetizer with that peanut sauce and omgoshhh that was sooo yummmyyyyyy. Never had that before and it was amazing! and also a side of white rice- which is always yummy in my book :)  I absolutely loved the pho! love how they fried the tofo, because im kinda iffy when it comes to tofu but this was really yummy. i didnt add to much sauce to it, just jalapeno for spice and i added the additional veggies.   for someone who has never had pho i really enjoyed this meal and i tend to crave it alot! i will definitely be coming back here!!! I also love the plaza/mall that they have! very nice :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Pho place in Arizona.  The menu is diverse, an the staff is friendly.  They will answer any and all questions.  I've heard them giving \"lessons\" on how to eat pho several times.  The food is great, and the keep the drinks filled.  I've never had a complaint, and I've been there numerous times.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"OMG I just loved this place. First I love the name. LOL.   This had to be the nicest pho place I've ever been!  Summer rolls were awesome and the pho, was just amazing. I wasn't feeling well and good definitely made me feel better.  Customer service was great as well, kept checking on us and making sure we had even water!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I go here weekly for our pho fix. This place does get crowded, but it's worth it. Their food is consistently good. The restaurant is clean and the service is usually pretty fast."}
{"text":"Great pho and service, this place has the best pho in town. Its convenient when you can go to grocery and have all kinds of food in Mekong Plaza."}
{"text":"How can I PHOget about you, unPhogettable? My boyfriend had told me many times he had taken to-go pho from here and said it tastes just like how CA's pho . I had to try it myself.   Finally got to try it for lunch. with him when I visited and he was right! Out of the other Pho places he had taken me to around Phoenix, this is the most legit pho you can get!  The broth and noodles tastes the same as the ones we have in LA. Thank you Vietnamese chefs who makes good broth!  By the way, if you get super full off the food, you can walk around the market! It's an Asian market, so if you live in a area that only has Albert-son, Fry's or Ralph you should definitely stop by for some Asian grocery shopping, maybe you can make some at home and enjoy a Vietnamese meal ;)  can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"Decent little Vietnamese phò place.  Ordered : A5 vegetarian spring rolls - tasted different from other Vietnamese or thai places. Was great with soy dip.  V5 - vegetarian phó with fried tofu- quantity is too much for the price. Tasted bland at the beginning, with sriracha sauce, tasted delicious.  Not loud, decent place for 1or 2 visits a month."}
{"text":"Overall pretty good.  Pho, great.  Beef with rice, awesome.  Iced coffee, worth the trip just for this.     Staff was very friendly and helpful.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Such a good spot! Is close dining with smaller grouped tables but the food is so delicious you don't mind your neighbors. Try the meatball pho and the wontons"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place for pho in the Phoenix metro area. There are several options for pho available (16 different varieties, to be exact), I'm a fan of the rare beef (#13) and my boyfriend usually orders the combo with everything (#1). The broth is by far the most flavorful of anywhere we have been in the valley. The spring rolls or egg rolls make for a great appetizer and their Thai tea is excellent. The owners are very sweet and check to make sure everything is tasting good every time we come in.  I highly recommend UnPhogettable!"}
{"text":"The last time I went to eat their pho I was not impressed. Maybe because I had so much of 43rd express and phone avihna- or davang cafe. Those 3 has better flavor and better portion. I think they have the same price range. But I have to actually put some spices on my pho to get something out of the food. I think they get a lot of people because it s convenient on those who just visited the market place.   If you thinking of phone I can't recommend this place. Its very forgettable."}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying I really like this place and may go back but I ordered food there last week and that same night I went home and saw it on Dirty Diners with 7 health code violations. I didn't get sick or anything but that's not cool..."}
{"text":"Pho comes in one size! Super delicious and flavorful broth. Friendly and attentive service from the people who work there. I'm loving their unique name, \"Unphogettable\"! Would definitely come back! :)"}
{"text":"I suppose you get used to your favorite Pho place and then everywhere else seems a little off? unPhogettable was like that, there was nothing bad about it, but it was a little off in my opinion.   For one, I wasn't a fan of the huge long communal like tables in the middle of the restaurant.  We got there when it was really busy and had to sit at one.  I just like my own space!  Plus, I am fairly sure they didn't have any AC, so it was really getting warm with all that hot soup and warm bodies packed in there.    We had attentive servers and the food came out quickly, but I wasn't wowed.  The Pho Bien (meatball) was served in a mediumish size bowl (only one size) with my own personal plate of herbs and sprouts (which was nice).  The pho was swimming in grease.  It is a personal pet peeve when places don't skim!!  The meatballs where quartered (I generally like them thinly sliced).  The problem with quartering a meatball is if it sits all day in broth cooking it will get rubbery, as these did. Other than that the broth was good.    Pho is like pizza, even bad pho is pretty good. I would say is was OK.  It just didn't do much for me."}
{"text":"Very clean resturant, fast friendly service, food is as good as the other location. I like how calm and quiet it is."}
{"text":"Amazing pho, quick service. They love kids here, they give free fake tattoos to kids. Service is quick they are very attentive. Prices are resonable.. i like that they taylor the food to your request.. staff is friendly. All around worth the stop any time of the year"}
{"text":"Hitting Mekong last night to try all the new restaurants we started here because they have Mi Bo Kho (beef stew with egg noodles), one of my favorites. So we ordered that as well as the egg rolls.. we almost started laughing when the egg rolls come out.. they were served with 2 pathetic pieces of warm iceberg lettuce and no herbs.. wtf?! While the rolls and the fish sauce tasted good they were greasy and without the romaine and herbs, ordinary.    The Mi Bo Kho arrived.. I was surprised to see about a half inch of oil on the top of the stew, I like some oil content but this was ridiculous! The stew tasted like it was made from a base and not from scratch.. had this weird fake beef taste. The meat was so fatty and not very well cooked. The meat was so stringy that it got caught between my teeth.   We finished sharing the dishes.. what a complete disappointment.. don't worry Da Vang, they have nothing on you!"}
{"text":"Good pho and good service. I feel it is slightly high priced by $1-$2 per bowel of soup personally but they probably have high rent due to location and the place is always clean."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a couple times and will keep coming back. The staff is so friendly! Wide variety of items on the menu which is nice. Huge portions. The fried rice is also very good!!"}
{"text":"We love pho and loved the mesa location. They were a little slower than most pho place we have been to but it might have been because I ordered bun chay and that took longer?   The broth and food was delicious and the service was good. The kids both ordered pho and ate the whole thing! I liked how they had a kids menu as well!   Will definitely add to our pho house rotation."}
{"text":"I was eating here because of Yelp  But I order fried rice and it had egg shells. Still in the plate it was bad I complained but all they said it was sorry"}
{"text":"Been back many times, the pho is consistently great.  And while they don't serve alcohol, they allow you to bring your own so you can pick up beer from the supermarket which is literally steps away. Lovely service, very clean also."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, the soup is amazing and fast and friendly service. The food is healthy, all natural with no additives. A must try!"}
{"text":"We live right around the corner from the Mekong Plaza, so this is our go-to place for Pho and good Vietnamese. The portions are more than generous, my partner and I can usually share a bowl and still leave more than satisfied. I don't think I've ever had a bad meal here. Both the beef and chicken based broths are flavourful, the cuts of meat are excellent. Neither of us have ever ended up with a fatty or chewy piece of meat, be it beef or chicken. Even my partner's 10 year old inhaled the Pho, and he's a picky little guy!   Try the Vietnamese version of diamond ice for dessert, if you like trying new things. Made with coconut milk instead of condensed milk, it's a refreshing way to cool off once the weather gets hot.   Whether you get Pho or one of the rice or vermicelli dishes, you'd be hard-pressed to find a dish that was really good. Add that to the super friendly and attentive staff, and you've got one very highly recommended Vietnamese restaurant!   The only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the price. Bowls of Pho are $8-$9, which is a little high comparatively. If they could drop the price a couple bucks, they'd easily be a 5 star!"}
{"text":"Not the most authentic of viet restaurants. Food was good. The eating area was clean. The place was \"PhoGettable\"   I recommend going a few steps further to the food court, where you can find three or four kiosks that serve up some tasty authentic dishes."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  I have never had a bad meal here and I don't understand the bad reviews I see.  The soup is always so incredibly hot and delicious - the meat is plentiful and tender.  The staff and the owner are always friendly and nearby for any of your needs.   The only reason they close early is because they sometimes run out of soup.  This is an intricate soup that has to cook for many hours before being served.   Thanks unPHOgettable!!"}
{"text":"I would rate this place 3.5 stars.  I really need my .5 star for many of my reviews.  Again, we picked this restaurant partly of its name and good reviews.  The name is very catchy and I wont Phoget for a long time.  however, their Pho did not live up to its name.    It's unPhogettable but not in a good way.  The broth was a little too strong.  I think the cook added too much star anise so it was quite overwhelming.  DH ordered Bun Bo Hue.  He said it was only okay.  My friends also ordered Pho bo and they thought the same thing.  The service was excellent.  Our waitress kept asking if we needed anything else.    The owner also came over to say hi and asked about the food.  I wasn't sure if I should tell her the truth or not.  I ended up telling her that everything was great.  I should have told her what I thought of her broth and maybe she should go easy on the star anise.  Oh well... maybe next time.  What do you say in this situation?"}
{"text":"this place was pretty awesome. cheap, quality food, great customer service and quick. Somehow the laws of physics cease to exist on their stoves cause they get your food out fast.. Over all the food was great"}
{"text":"Ummm where should I start.  I was craving for Pho the other day and our friend told us how good this Unphogettable was.  I even checked Yelp and they actually got 4 stars so I was really happy to go.  I know Mekong market smells but I didn't think this pho place would smell also.  When we walked into this restaurant I almost puked.  I was waking into sewage/bathroom.  My husband said we can leave but I knew how hungry he was so I said it's okay.  I ordered their pho.  The bowl was huge with so much broth and so little meat and noodles.  They were even stingy with bean sprouts and herbs.  I was ill all night after I ate there.  I will not be returning.  Only good thing was their decor, it wasn't that bad.  Again I will not be returning.  I have habit of not eating at a restaurant that makes me puke all night long.  I did loose a pound though."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and always try something different. Still, I am always pleased when I leave. Great food and great service. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Extensive menu and really friendly staff.  Always have had a good experience here.  Super for first timers as the owner does a intro course to Pho.    I thought I wrote a review before, I should have.....  Pros - awesome service - extensive menu - über fresh ingredients  - good portions and price - side sauces are an excellent touch.  Each table has an assortment of sauces to spice up your dish.  All good. Like the hot stuff!  Cons - none  I am not being easy by not coming up with any \"cons\" as the restaurant excels as their craft."}
{"text":"Service was okay, we were seated immediately but I kind of felt like I was being rushed to pick a meal but honestly other than that the food was great. I loved number 15 on the menu. The Thai tea was also not too bad. The dumplings/wonton/gyoza was actually really good, in not sure if they offered one that had more pieces but I wish I had gotten more."}
{"text":"Best pho in Az I've had so far.  They have the best variety of meats for their soups as well.  If you haven't tried marbled brisket order your self one.  NOW.  This stuff is gods gift to the world.  Tender fatty meat that melts in your mouth!  Oh so heavenly!  :D"}
{"text":"I love the pho here! This is my favorite pho place in the valley, and I tried a lot of different places in the valley. Their spring rolls are delicious, and I occasionally get their pork chops."}
{"text":"I used to go to the original location in Tempe all the time and glad they opened up a second location closer to where I live. The place is spacious and always clean &  you never really have to wait long for your food to come out. My favorite thing to order is the beef stew. I love the flavor of the broth and they never skimp out on the beef. Besides the beef stew I've tried their pho, rice plates and vermicelli bowls and it's all been good. It's a bit on the pricier side compared to some of the  other pho restaurants but as long as my food tastes good, i don't mind."}
{"text":"Wonderful little find while in town visiting.  Took my husband to Vietnamese for the first time here and he is hooked.  Great food, wonderful service and good prices.  Can't go wrong"}
{"text":"I love this place, the food is amazing and the service is the best.  I ate the veggie/tofu stir fry with rice noodles and the vege sprint roll.    I also recommend the Tropical Fruit and shaved ice if you feel like dessert."}
{"text":"Coming from an Asian,  this place is over priced and the portions are a joke for the pho special.  There are many other places that give literally twice as much for less 6 dollars."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Nat King Cole - Unforgettable)  UnPhogettable, that's where I am UnPhogettable in Mekong Plaza Like a sauce that's fishy that clings to me How the taste of Pho does things to me Never before have I ate this much and more  UnPhogettable in every way Add basil's and lime, that's how I'll roll That's why, darling, it's incredible That some place like UnPhogettable  Thinks that I am UnPhogettable too!  UnPhogettable is one to remember when it comes to Pho restaurants.  Every ones trying to be creative and this one definitely catches the eye and ears.    UnPhogettable is located right at the entrance of Mekong Plaza, an Asian grocery store, which is a prime location.  One of the first to open around that area so kudos to jump and the wagon so quick.    I ordered the Pho of course and so did my friend.  Nice warm to hot broth is important to me and this place didn't disappoint.  The beef round is which I'm used to is not used here unfortunately.  Instead it's cut into a triangular shaped and much small portions.  Too bad, cause that would have been the way I liked it.  The side condiments came in a small saucer dish.  Now I can appreciate that cause I only use so much.  For those of you that loves a lot of basil, cilantro, jalapeno, and bean sprouts...you will be disappointed.    Overall, the Pho doesn't blow my mind, but it's okay.  Service hits with a bang and I enjoy the black t-shirt uniforms instilled here.  Most Pho restaurants don't even have uniforms. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love me some Pho, I can't get enough of it but I don't know why.  I came here after hiking for four hours and I was very hungry. I had #9 pho and grilled pork chop with egg. Yes I had both.... don't judge me, I was very hungry!  I never had a bad pho and I don't know how to describe good noodle soup. All I know is that I liked it here so much I finished the entire bowl including soup.   Pork chop had nice flavor, I ordered combo with other pork dish, which wasn't the best I had. I think I would just stay with pork chop next time.  Portion size seemed smaller or I was extremely hungry to made me think that way. I thought pho used to be perhaps $1 less than what they charge here.   Service was prompt. I came here around 3pm, they had several other tables with customers. Clean inside.  Located at the same corner as Lee Lee."}
{"text":"Eat here almost once a week with co-worker.  Usually order number 7 on the Pho soup menu but sometimes would go for number 1 that usually have everything on it (tripe, stomach, etc) if you are into those things. Tasty and big portion always, good service as well.  Nothing like a good hot bowl of soup during cold chilly days."}
{"text":"Walked in for take out and immediately wanted to stay... buzzing with patrons, a heavenly smell you could almost taste, and a super friendly owner that had us at 'hello'.  But what about the food?  Having lived in Singapore and traveled through Asia, this is one of the most authentic Viet restaurants I've been lucky to visit on this side of the Pacific.  Portions are not huge but more than satisfied.  And the taste was spot on, very fresh and authentic.  Props also for the nice modern decor, so refreshing in a world of cheesy Asian restaurants with hi-five kitties behind the register.    We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Bone in my soup. Gross. Have been here a lot and nothing like this has ever happened."}
{"text":"Hands down,  favorite pho place! Love the food. I definitely recommend it if you're looking for truly delicious pho! There is smart always a helpful employee and all the ladies working there are so sweet!!"}
{"text":"First time there.  It's right up next to the Mekong Market.  The pho was solid (love me some rare beef and brisket), and we also tried the \"autumn rolls\" instead of the usual spring rolls. It has egg in it, so you know I'm a fan.  Overall, good pho, good price and good service."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Pho restaurants i have been to in the valley. The tripe and short rib pho is delicious!  Love the heap amount of herbs and bean sprouts they serve with the pho. This is the place to go to when it's cold outside. It's Asian comfort food!"}
{"text":"I used to make fun of unPhogettable. Because their pho was very forgettable. But then their flavor has gotten better recently and they're more fully staff now. Which means better service!!! That is the most improved aspect.  Blue Moon used to be my choice because it was super cheap but not that great. Now they raised prices and it's still not that great. And then there was that other pho place on Southern and Extension that had a double murder occur which made it shut down. Now that place was good but it's closed indefinitely.  Now back to this place...  I usually order the Beef pho #1 and like I said, flavor is getting better. It's probably your best bet in the Tempe/Mesa area so I recommend that you give this place a try. I think soon, they will earn my 4th star."}
{"text":"Up a notch since my last review. Awesome service specially by the owner. Their vermicelli dishes are bomb. I like the shrimp and pork one. Always clean, always fast. :)"}
{"text":"The pho here is pretty good and flavorful but it's pricer than the  other Vietnamese restaurants.  The crispy spring rolls are very bland which is pretty disappointing. Their grilled pork is pretty good especially over noodles and the portion is HUGE! We'll definitely return again when we're in the area."}
{"text":"The Pho was not unphogettable by any means but it was very good. If I could choose between this place and Pho Thanh up on Camelback in Phoenix, I would take Pho Thanh any day. Nevertheless, this is a good option if you are craving Pho and want a no nonsense place in Mesa."}
{"text":"Pho broth smells kinda weird.  Good service, really friendly (so not Vietnamese like!).  Otherwise, overpriced and there are better out there in AZ."}
{"text":"Very nice service. The food is very good. The place is clean. Have been here for a number of times and never disappointed."}
{"text":"UnPHOgettable that's what you are UnPHOgettable though near or far Like a soup of love that sings to me How the thought of you does things to me Never before has something been more  UnPHOgettable in every way And forever more, that's how you'll stay That's why, darling, it's incredible That something so unPHOgettable Thinks that I'm unforgettable too  Lyrics by Pho King Cole  I'm a sucker for that golden life blood broth that like the sun to superman recharges me from my drunken escapades. Granted it's not the best, lets face it, this is Arizona, the hotbed of Vietnamese cuisine, right?  Told by people in the know that this is the best they have and that if I'm in need to come here. Yes I was in needs. Hungover and feeling like a penny I looked like I just spend 40 days in the desert instead of 40 hours in the city.  Went with my standard spring rolls and large pho with extra tripe and meatballs, no tendon or flank. Soup was clean of debris from the parboil. Not oily slicked, but to me could use a deeper degree of coriander and spices. Noodles were looks and not packed at the bottom, plenty of room to mix and generous condiments. Spring rolls were tight, light, but could use more noodles. Peanut sauce could have the crumbled peanuts be more pronounced. Light on the fish sauce. An excellent meal.  I was surprised they had a sister store in Virginia Beach, soo far from Arizona.   The next day, same sob story, hurting from the night before I treid the Mi Vit Tiem, roasted duck leg soup, earthy, not gamey, rich and flavorful, but didn't have the same effect as my beloved pho. Kind of classy.   Service is great, totally family run. Prices are average, parking is stripmall ish and plenty. The Vietnamese coffee was the only real downfall. Kind of weak in my opinion. Just thick and I had to ask for extra ice. Not bad for Arizona.  Love how they open at 9am, but close really early between 8-8:30."}
{"text":"I've come here probably half a dozen times now. Not only do I go around to restaurants and eat pho, I also make it at home. I like taking the lazy way sometimes and going out to eat instead of nursing a pot for a third of the day. This place is where I like to go whenever I'm in the area or going to Mekong.   The food is delicious. The beef broth in my beef pho was flavorful and not overly salty.   Parking is plentiful of course from being in a shopping plaza.   The eggrolls are delicious. They're not stuffed with nothing but vegetables like other places.   The prices are reasonable. Higher than what I pay at my corner spot but in a better location so I could reason why the price would be a hair higher.  The place is medium sized and clean. CLEAN is how I like my Asian restaurants.   The owner is a nice guy and the staff is friendly.  Anyways, to sum it up: I'll recommend this to anyone that is  PHOking hungry."}
{"text":"Our favorite local phó place - we come here all the time. Fast, polite service and great food!"}
{"text":"Decent pho, nothing much to brag about. Service was always excellent, being Vietnamese and I know pho pretty well, it's just a little over priced for me."}
{"text":"I live in the area and shop in the Mekong plaza from time to time so I decided to check this place out for Pho. It's very casual, you can sit anywhere you like. It's a smaller restaurant with TV's around and tables for big groups and couples. I ordered my chicken pho to go and waited only 5 minutes (I didn't call ahead to order just walked in). Staff was very friendly and even offered me a glass of water while I waited. The pho itself is a very generous portion and for those that have never had it, it's like a soup on steroids! The broth is so fragrant and tasty...you add in the rice noodles, meat and veggies yourself.   I really liked this place and would recommend!"}
{"text":"Best phò in town! It's the only place I come to eat this stuff! Recommend this place to anyone looking for some bomb phò!!"}
{"text":"This is my fiancé and I's favorite pho/Vietnamese spot in Arizona! One of the only places we'll go! Their pho, bun rieu, goi cuon, are my fav's! Whether I eat in or take it go.. Always amazing!!  The owners are the sweetest friendliest people ever! Always helpful and when we bring new people in they explain it very well! Yes I've seen some people comment it is pricier than other restaurants in the valley... But u get what u pay for!"}
{"text":"Food was great and super flavorful. Service was impeccable with the server explaining all the different options. I wish more restaurants would take note of the service level that this place delivers.  As a side note; definitely check out the supermarket next door, it is quiet an experience!"}
{"text":"I have spent three years in Tucson to try most Pho. I always think Phoenix has better than Tucson. Also, one of my colleagues recommended this place to me several month ago. I finally came and tried this weekend and was totally disappointed. The service was great. We didn't wait for table and didn't wait too long for food. (The waitress was very thoughtful. I ordered vege noodle and spring eggroll, but didn't realize the eggroll had meat/seafood or vege/tofu options. She pointed out, and let us to do half and half. Other than that I might give 2 stars.) I had Thai tea, which was not surprised. It was actually like something you could find in grocery store and make at home. My boyfriend had the #1 Pho. The soup was most disappointing part."}
{"text":"This is a good, clean place if you want some Vietnamese food.  I am not a huge fan of their pho (and I've lived in Los Angeles and San Diego where I have been exposed to amazing pho), but the rest of their food is good.  I specifically love the S5 which is the egg noodle soup with duck. I have had this dish at many other places and never has it been as good as it is here because most other places make it too sweet.  The service here is also great, and I have met the owner and his wife on several occasions and both are really great people and really care about their customers. Ingredients are always fresh such as the jalapenos and basil given on the side. And there are TVs if you want to stop by during a game that you don't want to miss."}
{"text":"Quick and easy lunch spot, great noodles, yummy broth, just a nice simple tasty meal."}
{"text":"This was our 1st time eating there and it was pretty good. We order PHo (#8 and 9) and also chicken egg noddles. Out food arrived in less than 15 min and the waitress was helpful and nice. The only thing I dint like was their coconut water, I'm used to the pacific coconuts, it was too sweet for my taste buds. I will come back again!"}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in Tempe, hands down. I've been many times and have yet to not have an excellent meal. Fast service, good food."}
{"text":"Good selection of pho dishes and bun bowls.  The pho had a lot of noodle but not much meat.  The bun maybe a bit much lettuce.  Service was good and food came out reasonably quick."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Pho I've ever had in my life. My girlfriend and I come here on the regular. #13 Everyone that works there is super friendly and hot damn are they fast when it comes to service. 10/10 would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I have not had a lot of Vietnamese food, only Pho at Saigon Kitchen out here in Surprise, lots of boba milk tea, and spring rolls at a few places.  My Sisser kept telling me about this place when I told her I want to try more. Well she brought me here the other day to get take out.  It had to be take out cuz we were doing showing off places we like order out dinner night, and I was getting her some beef chow fun for ACE on the other side of the road.  We got a ton of spring rolls and a salad.  They were so NICE to us while we ordered and waited for our food and when they brought it to us we ended up in a great conversation about the love of food and how much they care about what they are doing in their restaurant.  Very impressive.    We couldn't wait to get home to try it and we were starving so we started digging in on the way home... :)  I LOVED the salad, the spring rolls were also very good. The sausage one was my fav, I love the cilantro.  The sweet chili sauce was my fav. I usually love the peanut kind, but that was the only thing I didn't get wowwed by, it was good but not great.  I would still eat it often and enjoy it, I just know I have had better... but this is only for the peanut sauce, everything else was amazing!"}
{"text":"Very presentable for a \"Pho Joint\" (ultra clean and modern in a Shopping Center with a large Oriental Market) with a very nice broth that may be almost as good as higher ranked locations, but slightly less robust.  It also could have had a little more meat (had rare beef slices and well done brisket variety). Another tasty rendition of Pho was the Chicken Pho and it tasted great as well. A gorgeous looking vegetable plate was also a hit at our table. Shrimp Spring Rolls were excellent and a bargain v/s the others. The owner was a delightful man who said they cook Pho Broth for at least 24 hours. I \"Go For The Pho\" in Vietnamese Restaurants, thus I can only give it three stars when comparing it to others I have had, but a very nice rendition of Pho Phavorites!"}
{"text":"Exactly what I needed this evening. This bowl of noodle soup is never a let down, always amazing! Bonus, it will knock out this cold I feel coming on. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"UnPhogettable is one of the most consistent Vietnamese places in the area. Every time I go I leave satisfied with my meal and customer service. My two go-to choices are #1 and #37. UnPhogettable's Pho is really good in general but I must emphasize how good the broth is! It's clean, no debris floating around, and full of robust flavor. If someone gave me a bowl of broth by itself I would be happy, but then you add the noodles, onions, and beef and you're in heaven. The ratio of meat and noodles to broth seems perfect, you can finish the whole bowl without feeling like your stomach is going to explode, totally satisfied. The meat alone is pretty tasty, I can't decide if the meatballs or steak is better. In addition, if you ever have a sore throat or are feeling sick, Pho is the way to go, it always makes me feel great."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Pho spots in the valley. They have a large selection, great food. Their wait staff is very pleasant. The restaurant is always very clean."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS Veggie w Tofu Pho, chock-full of seasonal vegetables and full of flavor. Portion sizes are 'just right ' so that I didn't feel stuffed or wasteful. Most noteworthy was the super attentive service.  I see myself traveling far from home to visit again soon!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in all of the Greater Phoenix area, I have no idea how many times I have been here. Their Pho is the best I have ever had (including the San Francisco Area). Their service is amazing, and they take the time to answer your questions and explain the menu.  The name explains exactly what this restaurant is, unPhogettable."}
{"text":"Excellent soup, learned about it on a rainy day and brought my family..... Had Vietnamese soup at many places, but this one tops them all"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pho place in the valley. Though I live in downtown Phoenix, I sometimes work in the East Valley.   The service is excellent and fast. When we ask for extra limes, they bring them and do not charge extra (some places charge for little things like this).    The pho is in a huge bowl and comes with the usual extras.  I tend to always bring home leftovers, just a tasty the next day.   I've tried a few pho places in the valley, and this is by far the best one."}
{"text":"I have never felt more compelled to write a Yelp review. This was place clean, had great service, and some of the best pho I've ever had. Completely authentic and on par with my family's.  Portions were appropriate given the price. Great simple, clean venue without an overloaded menu. They keep to the basics and they do them well. We had pho ga (chicken) and pho Thai bo vien (steak and meatballs). The spring rolls were also freshly made to order.   You can definitely tell that it's family owned. Everyone was extremely attentive and was happy to assist in any way. I will definitely come back and recommend to anyone looking for a great bowl of pho in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, didn't review it the first time I was here. I've tried a lot pho' while living in San Diego, this place is pretty good. I spoke with the owner the first time I was here, he told me he marinates the broth for 24hrs..wow! No wonder the pho' here is good! I would recommend this place, good service, and food comes out right away!"}
{"text":"Looking for your standard Pho and Vietnamese fair?  This place does it just right.  I spoke with the owner and length and he was very proud of the freshness of ingredients they use, and that everything is done on sight, they are not using premade ingredients.  The effort shows in the food that is served- excellent!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch with my fiance and I'll leave it simple and sweet for ya. If you like pho, this is a must go to. So much flavor in the broth and my steak n shrimp was just as flavorful."}
{"text":"The broth is the best part! Everything was perfectly cool and balanced. Will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Quick tip: don't order the spring roll for an appetizer."}
{"text":"This place was poppin! Usually pho places are fairly low traffic but this place was very busy and saw lots of different colored people which was really good! The pho places in LA are frequented by mostly Asians. Asians seemed like the minority here :) I got the pho with rare steak and tendon. The steak was good quality and wow the tendon was straight up tendon! It was tough and almost felt undercooked but I assumed that's how real tendon should taste/feel. It even looked intimidating so I didn't eat it all haha. The broth was very clean.. The pho was clean and tasted very organic.. Not what I'm used to. Overall average pho but excellent service and clean restaurant. If I ever want pho in Arizona, I will come here again."}
{"text":"We moved to Mesa from N. California three years ago and have been looking for good Vietnamese food ever since.  Unphgettable does not disapoint.  It is by far the best Viet food we've found in the Valley of the Sun, and rivals many in the SF Bay Area.  Very highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time not knowing what to expect...  We were recommended by one of the waitress to try the Pho since is the usual dish they serve there and how is served (big plus)...  So we ordered a number 1 (all meats Pho), a number 21 (Shrimp Pho) and an A1 (spring rolls appetizer)...  After trying the appetizers we were surprised by the taste and couldn't wait for the main dish to arrive...  Once they arrived, we started eating (although we had some issues handling the chopsticks) and i was blown away...  i would definitely go back for more..."}
{"text":"It has been a whole year since I've been trying some Pho. Thankfully for Yelp I came across this place with enough reviews to convince me to try some Pho here.   We come into the restaurant and it is actually a lot larger inside than it looks from the outside. Everybody inside was really nice and inviting. People who were coming in for lunch were greeted with recognition which was pretty nice knowing that people were coming back.  We started with egg roll appetizers and we have never had egg rolls with lettuce wraps. They were amazingly good! Our pho had came to our table and the smell was amazing. I ended up adding the jalepeno and the hotness of the broth had released the chili aroma and was just enough spice. The only complaint about the pho was how the chicken had tasted. The chicken had look and tasted like it came from a package. I'm not too sure why it had an odd taste but it did not set to well with me.  I would definitely come back to this location for some pho. Another reason I would come back is for the surrounding asian market."}
{"text":"Well, first of all you have to love their tongue in cheek name of the restaurant.  We went here with a Groupon to try something different.  The Phò was excellent.  Clean and simple surroundings. Located inside a mall with an Asian grocery outside.  A bit of a hike from the Scottsdale area but worth the trip.  Plan some other things in the area, such as a trip to Lee Lee's."}
{"text":"By far our favorite restaurant in the Valley of the Sun. The owners are always there and treat everyone that comes in as if they are friends & neighbors.  We took my Uncle from San Francisco here when he visited, he said it is as good or better than any Vietnamese  place in the Bay Area. My Aunt is from Southeast Asia & he served in Vietnam, so he is no stranger to the cuisine. We eat here at least once a week."}
{"text":"I think eaten here close to 50 times now so I thought it was about time to write a review. The service, decor, and overall ambience of the restaurant is nothing special, but the food is SO GOOD that I don't even care. I get the same thing every time I come here (number 4 on the vegetarian section of the menu) and it is absolutely delicious! Everything tastes so fresh. Best Pho I've ever had."}
{"text":"I like it! The broth was great. They give good portions of pho noodles and meat. Service was great. I think the lady liked it when she found out that I was vietnamese. =P All in all another great pho place to frequent while i'm here in Mesa."}
{"text":"This place was great! I tried a bowl of Pho and a central Vietnamese specialty dish called Bun Bo Hue which I really enjoyed.   They are stingy on the pho noodles and meat but the broth flavor was solid. Size up on the noodles quantity if you can. The price was higher the average for pho, around $8-$9 a bowl.   I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had a variety of regional cuisines and specialty dishes as well. The Bun Bo Hue has a beefy sort herbal flavor here. It's very similar to the traditional pho bowl, but Bun Bo Hue soup has more flavor, contains chopped ginger, and uses thicker rice noodles. I ate it with my mix of lime/hoisin sauce/sriracha on the side and threw in little bit of every herb - the mung bean sprouts, the purple cabbage, etc. It's worth a try if you're looking to be more adventurous!"}
{"text":"I'm always down for a place that has a good 'pho' pun in their name. Towards the end of a vacation, I tend to crave Vietnamese food (I'm Vietnamese and from Dallas!) but things usually get pretty tricky because I'm always comparing them to restaurants back at home. Everyone should have a staple for their pho and if I lived in Phoenix, unPhogettable would probably be my go-to place for pho despite some setbacks.   The broth is pretty standard and has a decent flavor to it. The vegetables are very fresh and great quality. Unfortunately the meats are kind of \"eh\". The meatballs were mediocre, the tendons were alright, but a couple of the meats in my friend's \"pho dac biet\" were really tough and hard to eat. unPhogettable does it's job of satisfying a pho craving though.  What I don't like about this place is that there seems to be only one size of pho. Most places have small and large. I feel as if they are wasting a lot of food by giving everyone the same sized bowl. The prices are higher compared to other pho places as well. $9.75 for a bowl of pho dac biet? I have never paid $10 for a bowl of pho. It's usually around $7-8."}
{"text":"I love this place! The staff is very friendly and the food is un-pho-gettable!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and good service.  Broth is savory and delicious for both pho and bun bo hue.  I personally wasn't a big fan of the rice dishes thouhg. (they don't have the meatloaf thingy! wth?)  I think the price is on the expensive side though for a bowl of pho.  Otherwise, great place to eat!"}
{"text":"I feel weird saying this as criticism... but where is my beef tripe?  I asked for tripe, along with flank steak in my beef pho, but I came off feeling like some sort of rich guy.  I dunno... there's something to all those non-choice cuts of animals that makes a meal authentic.  Alright, the pho portion sizes are huge, the broth is quite flavorful and served acceptably hot (could be scalding-ier though), the vermicelli is good (hard to screw that up), cuts of meat were tender, greens abundant.  A solid bowl.  I'm less impressed with their Bun Bo Hue.  The noodles are very tender, again cuts of meat are tender, but there is absolutely no heat to the broth.  Also, I'm not sure if it's a culinary choice by unPhogettable chefs, but no congealed blood?  Service is quick and the staff is very friendly.  Despite being a sit-down restaurant with table service, the atmosphere inside has a very cafeteria feel.  (It's hard to put in words, but when you step inside, it makes more sense)  Prices are a bit on the high side for a pho joint, but still very reasonable and by no means expensive.  Portion sizes are large.  Definitely more trips for the pho, but as a Bun Bo Hue afficionado, that was a bit disappointing."}
{"text":"\"Unphogettable\" is right because I will definitely never forget how much this place sucks!   Everything looked and tasted so cheap! The nem cuon is all lettuce (no mints), the pho broth is bland, you get like 4 pieces of meat in total even when you order dac biet. Therefore this place is overpriced as hell! I have nothing good to say, it's probably the WORST vietnamese restaurant in the phoenix+mesa+chandler+tempe area combined. Take your business to com tam thuan kieu or pho van."}
{"text":"UnPHOgettable is absolutely phenomenal and the service staff goes out of their way to educate newbies to Vietmanese food such as myself.  For example, Alexander C may not have been educated as to how to properly enjoy his shrimp and pork stuffed egg rolls.  My server showed my how to wrap the hot and crispy egg rolls in a piece of crunchy cool iceburg with pickled carrot and onion and dip it into the sweet fish sauce with added spicy red pepper sauce.  The contrasting hot/ cold and sweet/spicy elements came together in a refreshingly unique way.  Go in with an open mind and if you like, the staff is ready to provide you with a first class education on how to enjoy the flavors of Vietnam.  Lesson #1: unlike Thai food, Vietmanese food is typically not spicy (hot).  I would recommend unPHOgettable to everyone!"}
{"text":"I was beyond pleasantly surprised!  The broth is the best I've tasted!  And I've eaten a lot of pho, from SF to Oregon and nearly everywhere in between.  That I made the time to post speaks volumes.  Excellent food, service was awesome and attentive but not overly so.  I will definitely be back.  This is on my list of must go to places!"}
{"text":"Coming from Socal, I'm used to cheap and fast pho. I came here with a party of 7, and was a little disappointed by the cost & speed. $9.50 for a bowl of beef pho (the one with everything) & $5 for some spring rolls? Makes me miss California...  Aside from the cost comparison - this place did taste pretty good. The portion sizes were also a little smaller than what I'm used to, but Socal is a little more saturated with Vietnamese food. If I feel a sudden craving for pho, I'll definitely be back here! But if I'm looking for a cheap & quick meal, I may be looking elsewhere..."}
{"text":"I really like pho and I was super excited to introduce my partner to the experience.  The Thai tea was awesome. I loved that they used crushed ice to make it like a slush. Great for the rising heat in Phoenix.  The spring rolls and peanut sauce are good but not the best I've ever had.  The broth was a bit greasy and the tripe was rubbery and didn't get much flavor. Tripe is a secret favorite of mine. Love the stuff, but I wouldn't get tripe here again.  My partner was a bit under whelmed."}
{"text":"They have newly renovated this place and the restaurant looks really good. The seating, lighting and the interior is clean and classy.   We went for lunch and ordered shrimp spring rolls, speciality dishes, duck pho. The shrimp roll was really good, specially the sauce served with it. The duck Pho was amazing, the duck was cooked really good and the broth made me want more of the noodles. The spice was a little less but u can always add the sauces or jalapeno. I would love to try other dishes and this has to be one of the go to restaurants for the Vietnamese food.   The price is very reasonable and would highly recommend this place to all pho lovers."}
{"text":"Although this isn't the nicest place in the world, this is what I expect Pho to taste like.  Situated in the Mekong Plaza, the restaurant is attached an Asian market (which I wanted to explore after our meal!) and has an authentic feel to it.  We were promptly seated at a long communal table (different, but we didn't mind) and we ordered hot jasmine tea before we delved into the expansive menu.    The tea was perfect and didn't have any jasmine leaves floating it (at Pho An Sen I was slighly irritated by this)--definitely my kind of tea.  We ordered the spring rolls with shrimp and pork to start.  I loved the warm tender shrimp and the crisp, fresh veggies.  They were served with peanut dipping sauce, and we experimented with the three sauces that were on our table (red chili sauce, hoisin sauce, sriacha).    The menu was organized by broth: beef-based, chicken and pork-based, and regional flavors.  The server (I think he was the owner) asked if it was our first time eating Pho and took the time to explain the flavors of all of the broths.  I decided on the Pho with sliced chicken breast (it was listed under the beef-based section, although it was more of a rich chicken broth), and ordered it with bok choi, mushrooms, and broccoli.  It came with a side of fresh bean sprouts, jalapeno, lime and basil.  The broth was complex, yet it had clarity to it.  It wasn't too oily (I HATE greasy-tasting Pho) and the chicken was lean.  Our server even showed us how to make the perfect dipping sauce (half hoisin, half sriacha and a squeeze of lime).   My friend ordered the beef-based #3.  It was spiced perfectly, came out piping hot and wasn't loaded with fatty meat.  He ordered slices of rare beef on the side, which were very lean and incredibly tasty.    On taste and service alone, I would have given unPhogettable five stars.  However, they closed at 9 on a Saturday night, and began to close up shortly after.  One of the waitresses propped open the door to shake out all of their floor mats.  This pissed me off because it was rainy and COLD outside, and it made both me and my Pho cold.  They started mopping and stacking the chairs before we even had a chance to pay.  It was like we were inconveniencing them for lingering at their restaurant.  This is one thing I HATE.  Paying customers have the right to linger as long as they want after a meal, even if it's for merely 10 minutes after closing time."}
{"text":"UnPhogettable is more than a pho joint with a witty name.  In the Mekong plaza, which you may recognize as a running theme for me, unPho is a gem. We go here for the fantastic pho and friendly service.  They make any kind of pho you could think of, and all are expertly crafted with the perfect base.  My husband, the carnivorous maximus, opts for the tripe and meatball, while I am a veggie pho girl.  We have also tried the bun (vermicelli) here, and it's just ok. The pork is great though, and the owner will give you his cooking secrets if you ask! Speaking of whom is SUPER friendly, and always thanks you for your patronage. He remembers the regulars as well and gets excited when you bring friends and family to share the experience.  If you enjoy great pho, don't hesisate to give unPhogettable a try!"}
{"text":"Portions are huge but I had the lemongrass chicken over vermicelli noodles and it tasted like there was hunks of peanut butter in the chicken. Overall, I would come back to try the pho."}
{"text":"I ordered the Shrimp Pho, it was the best Pho I've ever had. The Jasmin tea was fabulous. The staff kept coming by asking how everything was, joking with us, just an all around great experience. It was Valentines Day and they were very busy but it never showed in the service. Highly recommend and will eat here again when I am in the area."}
{"text":"This was my first pho experiene. My friends took me here over 2 years ago. It has definitely been unphogettable. The best pho I have had in the valley"}
{"text":"Love this place! The broth is unbelievable. The chicken pho is my favorite and their spring rolls are amazing!"}
{"text":"Two of us came to this Vietnamese restaurant to grab an early dinner inside the Mekong Plaza. The atmosphere was quiet, casual, and unassuming. The clean, modern interior was horizontally arranged with wall-to-wall paintings and natural lighting coming through the windows.   The Nem Nuong Cuon ($4.95) came with pork sausage, fried bread stick, and fresh veggies wrapped in rice paper. The roll tasted fresh, with the centrality of fatty pork flavors coming through to couple with good textures from the veggies. It was a solid choice, but not the best or the most affordable when value was taken into consideration.   The Com Ca Nuong ($11.25) came with grilled two fillets of tilapia, pickled veggies, a bowl of soup, and steamed rice. The price was too high when compared to other Vietnamese restaurants. The selection of the fish was not the best, and the seasoning was overpowering and salty. Thankfully for the bowl of soup that helped to balance the taste buds. I don't recommend it.  Service was hands-off but attentive and friendly when we needed them. Overall, their prices were higher than most places I have been, and the presentation and quality did not justify the higher mark up. Since many Yelpers have raved about their pho and other noodle items, I would be interested in coming back and give them another chance."}
{"text":"Wasn't really for me.   The food wasn't bad, I just didn't really enjoy it. It was bland and I'm not a fan of meat and noodles in water.   I probably wouldn't choose to come back here."}
{"text":"Best pho I've had since moving to the area!  Servers are nice and helpful (which is great if you don't know what you're getting into) Cafeteria style seating in a cozy but clean atmosphere.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"So bummed. My favorite pho and so close to my place. Today I got vegetable pho and a few bites in I noticed a bug (not exactly sure what kind) in my soup. I called in and the woman who answered the phone was very apologetic and offered my next time in free...but idk if there's gunna be a next time"}
{"text":"The service is friendly. They gave us time to order and were very easy with customising the menu to our liking. (We changed one of the soup bowls with grilled pork) The fresh spring rolls were good. I liked how they had both pork and prawns in it. I ordered the bun with grilled pork and spring roll. The ingredients were fresh and they weren't stingy with the meat! Servings are a good size too."}
{"text":"What the Phò!?   I am sort of blown away here. I mean, I live in San Francisco. We neighbor San Jose which has a huge Vietnamese population.  And, this is top three Phò I've ever had. And, the Bun...best I've ever had.    I'm at a loss...and,I'm now really jealous that this place is not down the street from where I live. I grew up in Tempe. So, when I'm here visiting I'll definitely return.    The chicken in the Phò was delicious and tender, the egg noodles were fantastic and the broth was to die for.  As mentioned, the Bun was terrific too. Fresh herbs, great little fried egg roll, etc.   The owner explained that they cook the broth for 26 hours. Flavor flave style.  Wait, can Flaver Flave actually cook? No one knows! And I don't want to find out. Just get your face into some of their fine soups and other delicious Vietnamese creations."}
{"text":"So good. The bowls of pho are huge and served up quick. Service is top notch and this place stays busy. The peanut sauce that comes with the spring rolls is the best!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough how good this place is. The pho is so good. Best broth I can think of that I've had. The brisket is smokey and just the right amount of fatty goodness. The rare beef tenderloin in there adds that delicate texture. Eat it. You'll love it or your money back. Not from me of course! I've had the bun with pork and shrimp too and that's also fantastic. The cha gio are really good, the goi cuon are good too. Nothing particularly special but solid. I prefer the imperial roll of the two I've tried. The entree dishes are a a couple bucks more than some other places but you're fine with that. Don't sweat a couple bucks you cheap ass because it's worth it. Open 7 days. Great especially for summer with the fresh tastes, don't be shy on the pho just because it's hot out. It just takes longer to start sweating once you leave. So good. My previous favorite place is usurped. UnPhogettable, the Usurper."}
{"text":"The best pho in Arizona! This place is always busy all day no matter what time you come here.  Very convenient location, I usually go for food shopping at Mekong market after."}
{"text":"Being from Washington state with a pho place on every corner, good pho in the valley can be hard to find. This place is the real deal legit! I drive from AJ to here! 100% on the money! Love this place!"}
{"text":"We went to this place aftet hearing some good things about their pho from our friends. We ordered a beef pho and a combination fried rice. These r the menu that we order regardless of which pho place we go to. This place was very clean and modern since it just opened up. I heard that it has another location as well. The pho soup was really good and was pleased with its flavor. The fried rice was cooked in a way I like it and also was very good. But I wish the shrimps and meats were little more fresh and jewcy. Other than that it was ok. They set up the sauce on each table so people dont have to ask for it. The combination fried rice came out with small soup which was very thoughtful. I will be back to try more and see if they can continuously do this."}
{"text":"Some awesome pho and broth ever according to our 9 year old. Pork & shrimp bun also very good.  Nice quiet atmosphere.  Oh and really yummy fried wontons....not all cream cheese at all!   Will definitely come back.  Thrilled to find good Vietnamese in the valley!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely unforgettable.  The service is prompt and friendly.  I have been there at odd hours, so it is not crowded, and it is not noise at all.  Their portions are plentiful!  I have only had Pho and spring rolls there before, so I cannot really tell about any other dishes.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place will leave you unphogettable, whether it be good or bad.  I have visited this place 4 times now.  First trip: with my wife and daughter. Food was good, egg rolls good, then main course. It took 20 minutes for then to bring us 1 pho (for my wife), and 1 rice vermicelli with pork (only dish I ever eat). My dish was good, and seemed like the portion was big, until my pork disappeared and the only thing left was lettuce. I think they included a small head of lettuce, little bit of noodles, and a tiny amount of meat.  Second trip: by myself since my wife delivered our second baby girl, and I wanted to surprise her with comfort food. Ordered a chicken Pho, and kids chicken Pho (for my daughter) to go. Server girl tells me that they do not make kids pho to go. Now I'm mad, but don't want to make a scene. I ask if I can get a side of noodles to go, in which she says \"yes\". I ask if I can get a small side of pho soup to go, in which she says \"yes\". Chicken? \"yes\" I'm thinking WTF is different from child's pho than what I ordered? Took my order and left no tip due to her stupidity!  Third trip: with my wife, mom, and our now two daughters. Pretty much same order as first trip, but my mom ordered same as me. My wife, being Vietnamese didn't learn English until her late teens, always orders in Vietnamese (hey we are in a Vietnamese restaurant right?). I guess either the server we had didn't know Vietnamese, or was of a different nationality because no matter what my wife said, she ignored my wife and kept asking \"what number?\" Again my food (and my moms) was pretty much a whole head of lettuce, little noodles, and little meat.  Fourth trip: with my wife, our two daughters, my mom, and my moms husband. Almost same order as last time, but I ordered rice vermecilli with beef, my mom and my wife order it with pork, and my step father orders pho. All of our food comes out, and again a whole head of lettuce, bla bla bla. But wait, my wife's food is not here, and the server is at the othe side of the place laughing and chatting with friends. Everyone is pretty much finished, and still no food for my wife. I go get the server and tell her that my wife didn't get her food. She comes over and tells my wife that she is not sure what happened. She goes to the kitchen, then comes back and says she forgot to order it for us, but put it in now. My wife tells her \"okay, please remember it needs to be Pork.  A little bit later the server brings her rice vermecilli with beef. My wife tells her \"I ordered Pork, and I reminded you that it was pork\".  The server tells my wife \"no, you order beef. I heard you say beef\". Then almost at the same time, my mom and I tell her very loudly \"I ORDERED BEEF, AND IT WAS OVER 30 MINUTES AGO!!!\".  So now the server is just standing there mumbling something, but does not offer to fix it or anything, she just keeps standing there.  So my mom says she will eat the beef, and we will take the rest home and add pork to it for my wife.  As I dump it into a to go box, my wife says \"wow, that must be a whole head of lettuce there\". Finally I was not the only one to notice. My mom offered to pay, and as we were walking out, the owner says \"do you want me to replace meat with pork?\"  Even though the food was descent tasting, we will never go back there again after those repeated experiences.  Their horrible service deffinately makes them unphogettable, but in a bad way."}
{"text":"Service makes this place a spot you want to visit once or twice or...many more. I had a rice noodle soup with pork and shrimp. You can order the one that comes with all, but my friends didn't enjoy it as much as I did mine. Good decoration and every thing tasted really good!"}
{"text":"New location same great taste! Love the vegetarian options!!  ask for vegetarian egg rolls, they are soooo good."}
{"text":"Unphogettable, earned up to its name. This family owned restaurant provides the best Pho in Arizona, and accompanied with the pho is 5 star service.   You quickly forget your at a Pho restaurant as the Waiters come to your table explaining the menu, and assisting you make the best decision. They come back and check on you frequently always ready to assist you. (If you are a frequent at asian restaurants then you know that customer service is not usually their forte.)  I had the Chicken Pho and asked for vegetables with it (they offer this on their menu). The broth was delicious and light like I wanted and the vegetables were so fresh, just lightly cooked and still crunchy.   We had an order of egg rolls and those too were delicious.   My husband had the Beef Pho (combination with all of the meats) and it was absolutely hands down the best I've ever tasted. I loved it so much that we went back the next day and I ordered the same one.  When my husband and I travel back through Arizona we will be stopping here again to have more of their fresh delicious food.   PS, my husband and I are now in LA, and reading some of the other yelp reviews, yes the Pho here is a little cheaper, but Unphogettable's pho is well worth the price because it is the freshest, tastiest Pho I've ever had. You can't be cheap when you want good food."}
{"text":"unPhogettable will be unforgettable for me (at least for good pho in the Chandler/Mesa general area). Came here with a friend on a busy Sunday afternoon. Service was pretty good. They forgot our drink order for awhile but once we reminded them (I say them because we had multiple table servers) our drinks were brought out right away.  I had the Bun Bo Hue which is a little different from the traditional pho on the menu. It has the thicker rice noodles instead of the skinnier pho noodles. It has a very strong spicy beef flavor with a darker broth. The flavor was delicious. Some might find this flavor too strong so I would recommend going with the traditional pho flavors on the front page of the menu if you are a beginning pho connoisseur. My friend and I also started with shrimp spring rolls with peanut sauce which were also delicious.  Sometimes all you need is a delicious, spicy, hearty bowl of soup and pho always hits the spot for me. UnPhogettable does it well."}
{"text":"So I've never had Vietnamese Pho before (pronounced fu, as in fun, without the n) and I decided to try it with a friend of mine who speaks Vietnamese and would be able to tell me what to order and what I was eating and also steer me to the best place in town so I'd have a positive initial Pho experience and want to go back again and again.  unPHOgettable is tucked into an Asian cultural center just south of Main Street on Dobson on the west side of the road and is part of the Asian grocery story, but has it's own entrance and eating area. It had a pretty nice atmosphere, the owner was very helpful and even recognized my friend and his wife as we walked in (I figured they either eat there quite a bit, or the owner remembers him because he doesn't likely see very many tall, geeky, white kids who speak Vietnamese). The menu had a very wide selection and did a decent job of explaining what each of the items are. The owner offered to go over the menu with us, since it was our first time, but my friend told him that he would handle it. The place was pretty clean and the staff was very helpful. My only minor complaint was that there was a minor fish odor in the air, but I wasn't quite sure if it was the restaurant's fish or the adjoining Asian grocery store that had the fishy smell. Either way it wasn't overpowering and didn't detract from our meal at all.  I ordered Pho with thin sliced beef and tendon. I have to admit, that when I looked at the menu, I thought tendon was tenderloin, so I assumed I was ordering thin strips of beef with beef junks. It wasn't until my friend's wife repeated my order with an emphasis on TENDON that I realized what I ordered. Either way though, I'm pretty adventurous so I figured I'd give it a shot. My wife ordered a flat noodle meal instead of the soup since she's had it before. The food didn't take long and we were brought our enormous bowls of Pho with all the trimmings. I added a decent amount of hoisen sauce, and an even more decent amount of hot sauce. The broth in my bowl actually ended up pretty dark red. I added in my bean sprouts, tore up my basil and plopped in my jalapeños to boot. I dug in and was amazed at how great it tasted. I wasn't really amazed that it tasted good, but that it tasted SO good AND I'd never had it before. Why had people kept this a secret from me? It was fantastic and right up my alley. Soup, hot sauce and noodles. I wolfed mine down and even tried my wife's noodle dish, not really enough to give a thorough review, but it was good, and I'd try it again.  The prices weren't bad, I ended up paying about $22 for the two of us to eat our meals and a small appetizer split between 4 people. Range: $7.50 - $12.00.  Sorry for posting without pictures, but I'm sure I'll be back and append some pics to this after my next bowl.  Because of this place, I am now a fan of Vietnamese food, specifically the Pho soup.

{"text":"If you are a Pho-natic like I am you will really like this place.  The broth is fantastic. They cook the beef bones and herb/spice broth for nearly 24hr.  The meet is fresh and tender. Lots of noodles and friendly service.  One of the owners came to our table and had us try a few new things. It was refreshing to see a place the gets great reviews and stands up to its reputation. I would certainly visit again."}
{"text":"Pho is very good, never had any issues.  If you ask for rare steak on the side, have them put it in or drop it in immediately because the broth isn't always hot enough to properly cook thin steak.  Tea is good, Thai drink is good.  Service is excellent and very fast."}
{"text":"Best pho in the valley and great service! I come here frequently and the quality and consistency can't be beat."}
{"text":"Once again, gave it another try and got the same thing. Small portion sizes, bland soup and rude service. A friend of ours worked here for a while and told us that she quit because her manager was so mean to her, which I am not surprised at all about."}
{"text":"Everything here is $2 more than any other pho place in the valley I've been to, but I will gladly pay it because their broth is MAGICAL!!!  The flavor just keeps going and going and going....you take a spoonful of it in your mouth and the flavors just seep sweetly into your tongue. It is amazing. I love it. This was the first pho I tried in the valley, and every other place I go to just cannot live up to it (although I do love how much cheaper the other places are lol).   I have never eaten dine-in here, I have only done pickup during my lunch break. I love calling ahead, picking up a couple things from mekong market and swinging by to get my magical broth.   This place has definitely lived up to it's name."}
{"text":"I frequent UnPhogettable 2-3 times a week and its my go to place for fast, friendly and UnPhogettable food!!!  You can always except consistent and speedy service with absolutely gourmet Pho that rocks.  Number 1 and S5 are my suggestions and I always suggest my friends to join me and just enjoy this amazing experience."}
{"text":"Okay, I will rate this pho a 7-8/10. I will not complain as I would eat it again in a sec. It was somewhat lacking in the aroma/spice of the broth. The soup had machine-sliced chicken breast which was tender and lean.  Noodles were thin and sparse. Once again, while they added some cilantro, I like my own sprigs so I can go CRAZY with the greenery. The place is clean, inside Maekong Market, so you have to deal with the lookers and the noise/parking issues. I think if I had to order out my last pho meal, I would go with Da Vang, Pho Thahn, or even Nam Sau in Glendale. It wasn't perfect, but it was un-pho-gettable. Worth going for the name, really. Oh, and I didn't see any beer. In case that matters..."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch here with my wife recently. Very abundant bowls of noodles in a beef, chicken or perhaps seafood broth - depending on what you order. I had a shrimp item and was a bit disappointed with the fact that it only contained 2 shrimp. But it was seriously delicious nonetheless.   Our waitress was very attentive and spent time (as mentioned by others) going over the menu.   I love Asian soups so I will be going back here soon to try other dishes."}
{"text":"The decor is modern. The servers were very polite and nice (unlike many viet restaraunts..sorry lol).   The Pho I got was BOMB! Clean broth, no fat (I do like fatty broth too). Could have added a little more meat.   The egg rolls were also very good!   Only down side is the PRICE. $8 for a bowl of pho is expensive. But because of the taste and service, I will be coming here again...and again."}
{"text":"The best Pho I've had in the Phoenix area hands down.  The owners are very nice and the service is fast."}
{"text":"Food is okay but price tag is high comparing to other vietnamise restaurants. Probably won't be back for a while."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service! This will be my go to place when I'm in the area! Pho was great and the spring rolls were delicious!"}
{"text":"Food was great! A little skimpy on the meatballs especially when you pay extra for them, otherwise great food. Nice and friendly staff as well!"}
{"text":"I've been to the other location and expected the same quality of food. I was wrong the broth was bland and there was no onions. They redesigned the inside from when it was pho van? But now they have community tables. The spring rolls were mostly pork which was dry and didn't have any flavor."}
{"text":"Definitely the worst Pho I've ever had my entire life. The restaurant looks nice (but very Americanized) but staff was a little unfriendly. Never coming back when I visit AZ again."}
{"text":"Finally writing my review. I found this gem of a place thanks to help. I have been here once a week and find myself craving it all week. If you are wanting to try someplace new or you are a pho pro, this place is for you. I absolutely love pho!. Everywhere I go I look to yelp to lead me to my delicious bowl of pho. The pho here is some of the best I  ever slurped. It savory and tasty. Plenty of fixings to mix in.  They staff is always awesome. The place is clean and tidy. Bonuses for being attached to the Mekong plaza. Great shopping for Asian goodies. Be sure to stop at the Vietnamese bakery on the way out and grab some almond crunch. This is a must go if you are a foodie in Arizona. I would write more but my pho is here!"}
{"text":"I'd never tried Pho before and it's not my cup of Tea, but the staff was great and the appetizer was amazing.  I've always loved all things Japanese, Chinese, and Korean and I walked in looking for something similar... just keep that in mind when ordering."}
{"text":"All I wanted was a big bowl of Ramen with all the fixings like I've seen in the pictures. My friend and I ordered to-go, little did I know how they would package the food. My broth and noodles came in separate containers and when I pour them together it just was not what I was expecting or imagined as far as taste and presentation. Next time I try PHO I'll definitely be dining in for the full experience."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. So does my family and the friends we have brought here. Delicious broth and always attentive servers. We recommend it."}
{"text":"The pho here is pretty good but I think it's a bit over-priced. I feel like it's the most expensive place to eat pho in Phoenix. Nothing too special. Decent."}
{"text":"The restaurant's name is cheesy but very clever! Probably one of the better places in the Phoenix metro to eat somewhat authentic Pho. Being raised in San Jose California I think I can taste a authentic pho with my eyes closed or even drunk!"}
{"text":"Great customer service.... Food was ok had only two shrimp in my seafood soup lolzz dissapointing not worth 9.50...ill drive extra mile for Pho Thanh...Never again cheat on my Pho Thanh the best in phoenix with amazing price with more meat, veggies, shrimp, and a yummy broth...sorry to say I wont be back..."}
{"text":"I love this place! When ever I feel down or I want a good pho meal, I go here. Great broth and they have great sizes!"}
{"text":"This is my go to Vietnamese Restaurant, because of the location, taste and the variety of dishes. They are fast, friendly and accommodating. I like #1 for $10.75 (Pho with lean steak, well-done flank, marble brisket, tendon, tripe & beef meatballs) and my wife had #S5 for $11.75 (Southern Region roasted duck leg egg noodle soup with bok choy & shitake mushroom) Both dishes has flavorful broth. During the summer I will try their Bun dishes."}
{"text":"I like their chicken pho the best out of many other places I've tried in the valley. They're fast and super friendly! I luv it!"}
{"text":"UnPhogettable was all the talk of my new workplace and when we finally went I realized why The pho is just unbelievably bright and with clean flavors I like the rare beef and tongue Make sure you get extra limes"}
{"text":"Best PHO in Phoenix hands down. The owner is a humble guy who goes to CA to get fresh ingredients for his stuff. Talked to the dude and he gave us free stuff.  The food was some of the best I ever had. Everytime I go to Phoenix this is my first stop"}
{"text":"Love this place they have good prices and good food and it has always been clean. I go here about twice a month always get #4 with veggies. Very yummy. After you leave give yourself a little treat and have one of the deserts from the vendor right outside for .75 you cant go wrong."}
{"text":"Disappointed? Yes...I have no intention in offending anyone and I apologize in advance for my bluntness.    When I sat down waited to order, I noticed most races other than Asians came in to eat...I started to have bad feelings about the place because with the experiences that I've encountered...almost 9 out of 10 pho restaurants that has more Americans or other races other than Asians eating means the place is not going to be good or only average. The reason is...Most Asians (often Vietnamese) knows their Pho so if the PHo is WHOA and worth it then definitely they will crowd up the place...(I am not hating or anything but this is indeed true) if u disagreed or dislike what u read, please move forward to someone's else review that fit your eyes   IMO if you're going to charge people overpriced food then you need to make it extremely good! Like out of the ordinary...  I am not a pro on food but I ate pho since I was a child and have tried tons of pho to know which ones taste good.  The pho here is not the worst but it ain't the best...it's average.   PHO GAN (PHO W/ TENDONS ONLY) ABOUT $9  PHO TAI (PHO w/ sliced beef) about $10 Bun thit nuong cha gio (rice noodle w/ pork meat & egg rolls) egg rolls were not cut...they gave only 1 full egg roll. About $10 something + $1 something for 1 egg roll...  The pho itself was cooked at the right level since it was soft to chew but not mushy.  Broth was clear and not oily...tendons was a bit rough (hard). It was a little difficult to bite a piece off so I had to put one whole piece in my mouth.  The sliced beef was somewhat thick...not thin enough but good thing it was fresh  The rice noodle was good...I tried a a piece of the pork and it was well marinated and not burnt up. Didn't eat the egg roll but it didn't looked tasty.  Services were eh...they mostly checked up on regular and old customers and due to the fact that most of the waitresses were not Asians...they only checked up on those who were not Asians...When asked them to bring something they weren't happy and were rushing to leave!   Clean place"}
{"text":"Love everything here, the Pho is the best in the state, the vermicelli salad is amazing and the servers are the best!"}
{"text":"This is my only  experience with pho so I dont have anything to compare it to. First time I came I got the beef, my friend got the duck pho. Now I get the duck every time, it is incredible. I ask for it with rice noodles instead of egg noodles. Also a huge fan of the Vietnamese Iced Coffee. Will be returning, weekly, or whenever Im recovering from a hangover."}
{"text":"After 20+ years of eating Pho and trying every Pho resturaunt between Scottsdale and Tempe, we keep coming back here!  The pho is always hot, they use fresh filtered water to make the broth (you can tell in the taste), their vegistibles are fresh with NO small bugs crawling on them (have seen it many of times at other places), and the staff is just so amazing at keeping you water glass filled.  Now the best part of all is the Ca Phe Da which taste like a SEE's Carmel sucker mixed coffee and condensed milk.  This is a must try!  See you again soon!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Pho I have had! I wish they were closer I would be here more often. Great service and clean establishment. The restaurant is attached to a market and shopping place with other places to eat. Take a walk around after you eat here."}
{"text":"The food and service were great! It was my boyfriend's first time having Pho and he really enjoyed it. We both had the beef broth Pho and we also had the spring rolls. The spring rolls were very fresh and the peanut sauce was on point. Definitely another visit in our future!"}
{"text":"unPhogettable Mekong Plaza 66 S. Dobson Road Mesa 85202  There are as many styles of the ubiquitous Vietnamese dish pho (pronounced PHA) as there are people that eat it, and of course, everyone has their favorite. Having eaten pho from one end of this country to the other, this is my favorite place to eat this wonderful dish.  We were seated immediately, and our drink order was taken. This isn't a fancy restaurant, but you wouldn't know it by the attentive service and spotless tables.  Companion and I started out with the Goi Cuon ($3.45), which are soft spring rolls filled with shrimp, pork and veggies and served with a delightful peanut sauce. If it were not for the fact that we were there for dinner, I'd probably have made it a double order and had just that, they were so good. Being made with soft rice paper brought a whole new texture to the party, and I loved the peanut sauce with it.  For main courses, companion ordered Pho Dac Bjet Bo Vien ($8.25) which is a soup tureen sized bowl of wonderful broth, filled with noodles, rare steak slices, flank, brisket, tendon, tripe, and beef meatballs, and asked for the tripe to be left out, since companion isn't fond of it. It was no problem for the kitchen to prepare it the way companion wanted it.  I ordered the same thing but with extra tendon ($3.00), since I love the texture of this item.   In making their broth, it is simmered for a minimum of 24 hours, which results in a hugely flavorful base for the pho. For those that don't care to have some of the more esoteric ingredients in their pho, there are many choices on the menu including a pho made with chicken breast and another one that is vegetarian. The pho is served with a plate of fresh Thai basil, bean sprouts, lime, and jalapeno's for those that like to add to the bowl. I always add some fish sauce which is on the table because I love the flavor of it.  It's hard to describe a bowl of pho except to say it is a meal in a bowl that is huge! If I eat this for lunch, my meals for the day are taken care of, since it is so big. (Yes, they will provide a take out for the rest if you need one.)  For those that prefer something other than pho (there are 16 varieties of pho), there are also 15 other types of soup on the menu, as well as 11 types of salads, 6 vegetarian selections, and a number of steamed rice items as well. Kids are welcome and have their own selections.  Restrooms have always been clean when I have been there, and service is so friendly you feel almost like your eating in a friends house.  I give them 4 stars for service, quality of food, and cleanliness. (And a big YUM for flavor!)"}
{"text":"Spicy pho with beef, pork hock, and tendon was very good, if a little fatty on the first visit.  The server noticed I'd picked off the fat and tendon pieces and told me that the tendon was good for the joints- it's the main reason consumers of this style of soup order it.  I told her the main reason I picked them off is bec., visually, the pieces look like fat, and I don't like to chew or swallow pieces of fat.  I managed to salvage some of the tendon to take home.  I'm trying to acquire a taste for them...  LOVED the che bau mau (tri-color bean with coconut milk frozen dessert ($3).  It usually comes with green jelly strings, but I always ask to leave them out.    On my second visit, I took a friend with me and we shared a plate of spring rolls- 2 pieces of  fresh rolls containing pork and shrimp, vermicelli noodles, lettuce, and spring onions wrapped in rice wrapper and served with peanut sauce (I requested mine w/out shrimp).  Honestly, I've had better at other restaurants, including the one across from Un-Pho-Gettable, Com Tam.  This version contained more noodles than meat (Com Tam's version includes a crunchy aspect of pork rind stick!), but I did enjoy the peanut sauce."}
{"text":"Love this place! Very affordable, and great quality food. Everything is very fresh. The staff is very nice and great at making substitutions (I get bean sprouts instead of noodles in my pho). I love their spring rolls (and other fresh rolls) and the hot soups. I only wish they were open later than 8pm! Then I could come here more often. But I definitely recommend this restaurant still! Yummmm!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Hands-down they have the best Pho and spring rolls in town. I have been coming here for years and the service is consistently excellent as is the food!"}
{"text":"A handy little stop in the Mekong Plaza.  Large, cheap and bustling.  All the usual choices plus some more.  Big portions but all the dishes we had did not stand out as anything more remarkable"}
{"text":"After hearing all the raves and rants from our Asian friends, I checked out the Mekong Plaza today, and of course had to start tasting every single restaurant on that premise.  unPHOgettable was our first choice, because bf wanted Pho. He got Pho with raw beef, I got the combo rice plate (eggroll, grilled pork chop and jumbo chicken wing). We shared spring rolls for appetizer.  Spring rolls show quality. Each roll was packed with thin slices of pork, and 3 good size shrimps. There was not a lot of herbs, just shredded lettuce. While I was impressed by the amount of pork and shrimp, the roll tasted dry and not very refreshing. It felt \"over-stuffed\" if it makes any sense.  The Pho was alright. Their stock was oily. Most Pho restaurants I've been to here in the US use \"clear\" stock. Even in Vietnam, my family and I specifically avoid the \"oily stock\" (you have 2 options: clear or oily). The taste overall was... alright. It felt like it was missing something. It tasted good at the tip of the tongue, but ended there. It was not flavorful enough to make you \"want to slurp down the whole bowl\" - said bf.  The rice was, again, alright. It came with a small bowl of soup (which is the stock for egg-noddle soup. It's pretty oily as well). The chicken wing would have tasted better had they not batter-fried it. The pork chop was tender and flavorful however.   Overall experience was OK. We were full, but feeling unsatisfied.  Price range: appetizers are about $3.50, main entrees are about $8.50"}
{"text":"Since this is Arizona and I'm biased towards California Viet places, I'm going to have to give this place 4 stars. The pho isn't that most amazing I've had, but it's not bad. It's good for the craving and it's better than lots of other places around here in Phoenix. I gave 4 stars because the food is average (if you've had Cali places before) but I gave the extra star because the service is a plus! They're really friendly and are attentive to you. I'll go again, it's probably the best I can get while out here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Best pho ever! I travel 100% for work and eat pho in every city! Not only was it the best Pho Tai, but the staff and owners treat everyone like family!"}
{"text":"Best PHO in the Phoenix metro area. It's my go to spot. Everytime I eat here, I head to Tea Snow afterwards for thai iced tea w/ boba"}
{"text":"I had a great bowl of Pho yesterday. The services were fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Unphogettable is awesome...other than the name being quite unforgettable, the food and service is too! Their food is delicious. Great flavors and  really fresh. They definitely take the time to get to know their customers and teaching them about how to properly eat pho. You might be wondering what I'm talking about but there is a way to mix the sauce in the tiny bowl to dip the meat in etc. Anywho, the price is alright, I think its the typical price per plate but totally worth it.  Definitely try the shrimp spring roll. One word: Heavenly!  Bottom line...I recommend this place for those who love great service and UNFORGETTABLE pho! ;)"}
{"text":"I thought this place was ok.  It's in a strip mall, but once I got inside, I almost felt like I was in a mall food court area due to the interior connecting entrance to the food market.  Servers were nice and prompt. Almost a bit too prompt, actually.  I felt slightly rushed when they brought me my bill as I was finishing my Chicken Pho.  I hat still yet to finish when they came around again to see if the bill was ready for them to close it out.  Pho was ok, but I've had better in the Far East Mesa area and I don't really know if I would drive out of my way again to go back to this place."}
{"text":"Best pho I have found. My friend and I have \"Pho Phridays\" and eat there every time we want pho. Fresh ingredients every time and everyone there is super friendly. They remember their regulars and make sure to seek us out to make sure everything is to our satisfaction. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is a great Vietnamese restaurant with exceptional service and delicious food. My daughter introduced me to this restaurant and it's one of our favorites."}
{"text":"From the time walked in 4 different people waited on my table. I felt like they truly were going to make this a great experience.  Ordered Pho Ga and it was very good...the noodles were just right but broth seemed a little weak (diluted) and the cilantro and jalapeño very sparse.  The wait staff was very good I would give them a 5.  I will return and try again."}
{"text":"The service was nice, waitress was polite and friendly.  The spring rolls were the worst I have every tasted.  The pho was not very good, lacked flavor."}
{"text":"I have been to unPhogettable about 5 times now! I have not been disappointed! Spring rolls are delicious and my Pho of choice is the #13! The portion size is perfect and the staff is friendly and very fast. I would have give it a 4.5 but the rating scale doesn't let me choose that."}
{"text":"Excellent Pho in any flavor or meat.  Their pork chops with rice is not what I expected with super thin slices of pork with a large heaping cup of rice.  And a few slices of lettuce and carrots  Service is fast and The Pho comes out just about when you're done with appetizers.    Fried spring  rolls are too small.  Fresh pork and shrimp rolls are decent."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good and a solid four stars but ultimately phogettable. The broth was very good but the meat itself was mediocre, chewy and low quality - certainly not what I expect from a nine dollar bowl. The portion size was good and the veggies and sauces were fine but the so so meat really keeps me from wanting to go back. Which is too bad because the broth was so good.  I also had their spring rolls which were awesome. Service was quick and good."}
{"text":"This place is always good, i've had the grilled chicken vermicelli, pork vermicelli, and grilled pork spring roll, all have always been awesome.  I always say i'm going to try the pho, but getting going back to the vermicelli.  Food is fresh and service is good."}
{"text":"When we lived in Mesa, we LOVED coming here. Just as awesome as our pho experiences in Seattle. UnPhogettable is where it's at. Really nice family who owns it, and great service to boot. It's just too bad it's usually hot outside in Arizona, or else I'm sure we would have come here for a nice hot bowl of pho and some spring rolls even more often."}
{"text":"The pho is so yummy and ingredients are fresh! The staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"this is the best pho broth around it has everything you would want in good pho...it's clear, the taste is amazing, and oh so yummy...the staff is awesome too"}
{"text":"Yeah NEW PLACE in place of Pho Van (did not like the owner nor service at Pho Van): New Owners, New Interior, Great Service, Very Nice STAFF and the food is very good. I've been to the sister restaurant in Mekong Palace in Mesa. I like this one better because it is closer to me, the food seems the same.  I met 2 friends here, we started off with the A2 (2 soft spring rolls) and then #6 (Pho with lean rare steak, well done flank and tripe), #7 (Pho with tendon and tripe) # S1 (Central region spicy beef based noodle soup with flank, brisket and pork hock). All the food was very fresh, and tasted great. My only minor comment would be all 3 bowls of soup could of been hotter in temperature, other than that, excellent!  Atmosphere: very nice, Service: excellent (nice that the owner checks on customers), Food: very good"}
{"text":"I'm always in search for good pho and trust me I've been to a lot of Pho places with my friends. Located in Mekong Supermarket, this by far is one of the best ones. Atmosphere nice, service was excellent and food was excellent. We arrived at 11:30 and by 12:00 it was packed.  We ordered the Soft Spring Rolls with Shrimp and Pork and the #6, Pho with Lean Steak, well-done Flank Steak and Tripe. My friend had #10 Pho with Lean Steak and well-done Flank Steak. The broth was delicious. Portion of noodles to broth to all the goodies, all evenly balanced.  Atmosphere: Nice, Service: Excellent, Pho: Excellent"}
{"text":"Delicious pho and spring rolls. Will be returning when the craving hits again. The service was great."}
{"text":"My family love this place! My husband has celiac and this is where he could safely order delicious food without worrying about gluten. We usually order rice noodles with book tripe and beef tendons. My daughter likes their rare beef rice noodle soup.  Even my Asperger son (extremely picky eater) likes their beef broth so much he would just have rice noodles in broth.  I like their spring rolls with pork and shrimp slices. Not too expensive for being hand made.  We add it when we feel like splurging a little.  If you are on a GF diet you need to avoid the hoisin sauce and regular soy sauce. I am not sure about the peanut sauce. Since I do not know how it is mixed. I am giving it 4 stars because I feel while the flavor has been consistent, the portion is a bit smaller.  I remember we used to get more \"stuff\"."}
{"text":"I go to unPhogettable all the time because I always order the Pho, but more than that. The summer rolls are better than any other place I've been!  I always get this one. A2 Nem NÜ§ng Cun (2 Soft SUMMER Rolls)?????????? $4.95 (Fresh rice paper rolls with Vietnamese pork sausage served with house special sauce). It's not hard to find good Pho, but these things are worth the trip alone for me."}
{"text":"Excellent Pho. S1 (spicy beef soup) is tasty but not really spicy at all. Service is excellent. Wish they came with more jalepeno slices (3 on the plate of basil/sprouts). Nice to have sriaracha, chili paste, hoison, fish oil and soy sauce on the table.   Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We just got done having an early dinner here and it was excellent! My boyfriend had the beef Pho and I had the chicken Mi Ga. Absolutely flavorful and just all out delicious! The staff was friendly and was courteous as well as accommodating when we let them know of my boyfriend's shellfish allergy. They actually helped him pick a safer broth. The portions are huge so we'll have plenty for lunch tomorrow too. I can't wait to come back here! This place truly is unPhogettable!"}
{"text":"My family and I love eating here, we've tried Pho at other places around the east valley and nothing else compares. Great staff and owners run the place and we've never had bad service. Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth my drive coming all the way from Maricopa! My family and I ate here and came back the very next day, that's how good it was, yes we had to have it again! My husband ordered the seafood pho he love it, I ordered the brisket pho, I loved it! We also ordered chicken spring rolls, shrimp spring rolls, chai tea, and I ordered the freshly squeezed sparkling lime aid which is my fav Vietnamese drink and it definitely was up to my standards! Everything was delicious and the service was very exceptional!! We will most definitely be coming back again and again and again"}
{"text":"I had to go with 5 stars...I'm SOOOO picky and this place hit all my sweet spots. Awesome local owner...fresh ingredients...no chemicals or MSG....authentic and just really, really good and the price point is right on too. I had #4 Pho and veggie spring rolls and we shared the fried rice. Yum Yum Yum! We will be back."}
{"text":"FAN! If this place wasn't so far from me, i would it eat it everyday, twice a day   The broth was a good balance. Not one spice stood out too much maintaining the flavorful balance of broth.  Get there early. I was there at 11am for lunch and already there were 6 tables filled."}
{"text":"Great food with quick and friendly service. The vegetarian pho is surprisingly healthy and tastes great with vegetable broth. Everything else I've tried here is a hit too."}
{"text":"I judge every Pho place by their Pho Tai.   unPhogettable's pho has an incredible broth. They also don't skimp on the pho toppings (I should really learn what these toppings are called--it's the dish with the basil, sprouts, jalapenos, limes, etc). I like the atmosphere of this restaurant because you can exit to the parking lot in the front or to the Asian market area in the back which reminds me of the small malls strewn about in the semi-urban areas of Japan and Thailand.   Only issue I have with this place is the price. You have to pay $8+ per bowl while Saigon Pho in Chandler is $5-6 and has better pho and quicker service.  Pho kind of reminds me of Chipotle. The heavily frequented Chipotles tend to have the best quality food (this is anecdotal but I am a former manager of Chipotle so I'd like to think I speak from legitimate experience). I'm talking tightly rolled, good salsa and sour cream distribution, the works. They simply get more practice and it shows. The unfrequented Chipotles tend to suffer in overall food quality. This goes for Saigon and unPhogettable in the same way. unPhogettable just doesn't have as many people come through so they don't really have the pho experience down to a science (yet). Nonetheless, you'll still enjoy great food and a nice walk through the market afterwards."}
{"text":"I must be busy Instagraming photos when I'm here... Even with the drive my favorite pho place in AZ. So many veggies and so much vegan broth and happiness. Always my numba 1"}
{"text":"Our food here is usually decent, expensive for what you get, but decent However, this time I ordered the beef curry stew and it was DISGUSTING! Watered down broth and nothing but globs of fat and a few shreds of beef. The \"manager\" doesn't have a clue. Pathetic. None of us will return."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place since location is convenient and the restaurant is clean. But the bowl of pho was overpriced for just mediocre broth and skimpy filling. I think I'll stick with the neighboring pho places from now on."}
{"text":"Not terrible but not the best. I eat a lot of pho, this doesn't make me an expert, I am aware of this, but all I can provide is my honest opinion. I had pho with flank steak and tripe. The steak was a little tough, the pho itself was not very flavorful relative to many others I have had in the valley. It did not taste bad by any means, but that flavor explosion that you usually get in your mouth with pho just wasn't there. I will have to give them a second chance, maybe it was an off day."}
{"text":"Had very good reviews so I gave it a try. It's in a weird place, attached to a grocery store. Had the Shrimp and chicken fresh summer rolls and they were good. Ordered the beef and we'll done brisket pho and it was good. Broth was tasty. Lots of meat and noodles. Brought both almost right away. Like a little time to eat my rolls before soup shows up but not a big deal. Had the Thai ice tea and it was good but done with shaved ice, almost like a snow cone. Very good and would go back"}
{"text":"I have gone to their other location many times before and was excited to hear that they opened a new location a little closer to home. Their pho broth is definitely 5 stars and I love their beef stew! The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because their coconut drink didn't come in the usual whole coconut that I love.. so I was disappointed. it was just a few slices of coconut inside coconut water so I felt that it wasn't worth it. the price is also a little more expensive that other local Vietnamese restaurants. But the staff is very friendly and the restaurant is always clean."}
{"text":"This place is so incredible. The staff is ridiculously nice and the Pho well worth it. I will probably be coming here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"I got the beef bun with egg rolls and the meat was SO good! My friends kept stealing beef off my plate. The noodles had a bit of a funny taste to me, but I haven't had enough of this dish from other restaurants to say if that taste is normal or not. The greens that came with the dish were fresh and flavorful.   The gentleman who rang up my to-go order was SUPER nice and hospitable. I received EXCELLENT customer service for the 4 minutes I was actually in the restaurant."}
{"text":"This is about as good as it gets! The pho here is fantastic and the portions are large.  The owners and staff are very personable and make you feel at home.  I try to eat here as often as I can and it's always a wonderful experience...can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"First visit and service and food was fantastic. Well be coming back."}
{"text":"Don't come here for bun Bo hue! I got here in the morning when they just opened 10' ago & ordered bun bo hue (spicy beef noodle soup) & it came out too salty, doesn't beef flavor in the soup, just water & beef & it costs $ 9.75/ bun Bo hue. My fresh coconut came out in a glass & taste like sugar water. They must made different process with this coconut juice. I wasn't happy w my food at all but the staff was nice to me for my 2 stars review."}
{"text":"Great pho very nice staff and owner. Right next to a huge Asian market."}
{"text":"This is a total gem in the desert.  The pho here is of comparable quality to pho in the Bay Area or east coast.  I strongly recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"We have been to the Mekong Plaza location many times in the past, so we were happy to see this location pop up as it is a lot closer to our home. We ordered our usual pho with sliced chicken breast and it was delicious as always! This location seemed a lot cleaner than the other one and they got our order correct when in past we have gotten home with the wrong items."}
{"text":"Food is good here. I ordered number one of the menu which got lots of meat. HOWEVER!!! The blonde hair girl who served us is really BAD.Actually, I didn't feel any service at all. Her face seemed like I owed her money! Our table run out of the sauce, the other waitress brought it to us.At the same time, I had no idea where she was.  I will never come back."}
{"text":"Great Pho!! It's a must try. I ordered the V4 and it was delicious. Staff is friendly and very attentive."}
{"text":"Fine Pho.  Nice atmosphere.  Great service."}
{"text":"I'm really not a fan.  But I could be bias because I lived in So Cal, and grew up eating San Gabriel Valley and Garden Grove pho really makes you a pho connoisseur.  My boyfriend did warn me to lower my expectations but for a place that has this many good reviews I would imagine it being good. I don't think I got my pho fix, the portions are small.  Gave it an extra star because the staff are really attentive and nice."}
{"text":"My friend took me here about 3 months ago, so the review is a little late.  After a night at the casinos, we all felt like pho the next morning.  I wasn't expecting much because Hawaii in my mind has the best Pho, but I was pleasantly surprised here.   Service was awesome, great...rare beef pho, and crispy egg rolls.  It's nice to know that a place like this exists.  I've tried others in the valley, and this way better than those!"}
{"text":"Best Pho ever and menu item S2 is amazing.  please open a location in chandler/gilbert!"}
{"text":"With the name like un-pho-gettable, how could I not try this Vietnamese restaurant!  Great atmosphere, attentive, kind, & prompt service :) great prices :) great fresh & flavorful food!"}
{"text":"This is easily one of my FAVORITE restaurants. Whether or not you're a pho fan, you should have your first experience of pho at this location. You'll instantly be hooked by their incredibly speedy service & delicious food. I've been here about 20 times now and continue to bring new friends each time. These new friends become obsessed with UnPhogettable and we often cannot compare the food nor service with any other pho location. On that note, despite your location, I still will always recommend UnPhogettable on Dobson Rd when you're in need of some reasonably priced large portions and a comfortable environment. It's worth the drive !"}
{"text":"Its rare for me to want to give a pho restaurant five stars. Usually they either lack in service or cleanliness or tastes like msg. But no, this restaurant really lives up to it's name   The mom and I came here before grocery shopping inside Mekong. The staff were really friendly and speedy in taking orders. It did take a while for our pho's to come out but they say it's because they make everything in order of ticket. Made to order pho?? I can't complain.  Meanwhile, it being our first time there, we decided to indulge in their spring rolls. There was nothing but shrimp, lettuce and noodle in the roll but surprisingly, flavorful.   We get the pho. The soup tastes clean and fresh. There seemed to be lots of cilantro in it which I LOVEEEED and my mom loved how it didnt taste like they poured in MSG. Large portion of noodles, lots of meat, and clean bean sprouts!! Perfect for a hungry stomach. Definitely unPHOgettable =p"}
{"text":"Great food and service!  Lots of variety on the menu, but the special part was how accommodating they were to our toddler.  Even brought out a pair of scissors so we could cut her food up."}
{"text":"Pho Tai here was A-ok  Was happy to see all the condiments around as well as fish sauce. (Sriracha was in a generic plastic bottle instead of its namesake package)  A strong force in Pho-land in Pho-enix would like to see some more noodles/meat to bump it up to the level of SF Pho places."}
{"text":"Let's start off by saying the name of this place is hilarious, which is the whole reason for my visit. I went this past Saturday, very nice place, nice waitresses, food came out fast. I just wasn't impressed with the Pho. The egg rolls were good and spring rolls as well. I probably will not visit this place again and just stick to Da Vang."}
{"text":"Just recently moved to Phx and have had many people refer me to this restaurant for pho. I have been here on numerous occasions and have had the best food every time.  I prefer the #13 and the fried egg rolls. The vegetarian egg rolls are very delicious as well."}
{"text":"Stopped in here tonight at the recommendation of fellow Yelpers. This place did not disappoint. It was very clean, unlike some Vietnamese spots I have been to, and the staff was prompt, attentive and friendly. My friend and I both ordered Pho. I had the #9 and it was awesome. The broth was full of flavor and delicious. We also shared an order of the fried rice. Which was wonderful as well. It was non-greasy and full of goodies. I am definitely a fan and will be returning."}
{"text":"One of the best pho and other delights around. The service and owners are so sweet and awesome. They have lots of regulars, Asian and otherwise, which says a lot in my book. My kids' favorite place, and they don't even have crayons."}
{"text":"This was so good and they have a great selection of food. Not just Pho so you got a little bit of everything!  We have found a new place to come and eat !!!"}
{"text":"Can't beat #44 beef stew with rice.. yummy :) a little pricey then other pho places and their service is just okay.. but their beef stew always have been consistent every time I got it at their original location by Mekong palace and here tonight."}
{"text":"The food is very good here and the portions are larger than other Pho restaurants. The pho base is very tasty."}
{"text":"Best Pho in the valley!!! Fresh brewed Thai and jasmine Ice tea. Easy parking and very friendly wait staff.  They close a little early, 8 pm, even on the weekend.  The menu is large but we've only tried the pho since that is our favorite."}
{"text":"My new favorite Pho place in the Valley!    The restaurant was spotless and the service was impeccable.  The owner came by our table personally to apologize for our 5 minute wait for a table and he stayed behind to make small talk with my little girl about her Little Mermaid doll that she had with her.  I thought he was really friendly and gracious and he definitely made this the most friendly Vietnamese restaurant I've ever dined at in the Valley.  The food was extremely delicious.  I got the Bo Kho soup and it was fantastic; hot, meaty and flavorful.  My husband had a vegetarian stir fry and my son got the vegetarian Pho and they both loved their dishes as well.  My little daughter also really enjoyed her fried spring rolls and her fresh, young coconut drink that comes served in a glass, along with the coconut meat and a serving spoon.  This restaurant is a little farther from me than I would like, but I'll definitely try to make it a regular stop when I am over in this part of the Valley."}
{"text":"BEST PORK CHOPS EVER! If you want to take a mini foodcation head over to Mekong Market in Mesa AZ for some of the best Pho in AZ. My first visit involved a romantic dinner date with a succulent, spicy piece of pork that dances on your tastebuds before finding a happy home in your tummy! (Now I am officially drooling) I'm sure everything else is just as good but I cannot stop ordering these darn chops! Once I get the recipe I will bump them up to 5 stars, until then I will continue to dream of this sweet ,sweet pork until we meet again."}
{"text":"After hearing great things about this place, I finally tried it out. Didn't like it at all because their rare steak tasted funny. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I was very excited to find a place that has vegan pho, well they call it vegetarian noodle soup, but close enough! My husband got the wide noodle dish, which I liked from the few bites I snuck in.   Overall it was good, but it didn't blow me away. I'll keep my eye out for another vegan pho in the area, but if I can't find one, I will definitely go back. Gotta have my noodles!"}
{"text":"My sister and I have been in search of a new Pho spot after ours closed. After countless taste tests at multiple restaurants, we've found \"the spot.\" We love their Pho and I would highly encourage other Pho snobs to try!  We always take to-go so I can't comment on the atmosphere but the other dishes we've tried are all great as sell. Solid and consistent."}
{"text":"I've tried the bun and the pho... both are great! The child claims this place serves the best broth, high praise from a super picky eater.  Great service, great food, great prices... worth a drive to check it out."}
{"text":"Great service, a little more upscale than a traditional Vietnamese restaurant. English speaking (a plus!) But, because it is a little bit on the nicer side...the price of a bowl of Pho is pricier. Not by much- just a couple bucks."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite pho restaurant. The owner is great and remembers us when we come in and always makes sure we are happy. I don\"t live in the area, but when I make it to town I am sure to go there. The pho varieties are diverse and they cook the broth for 24hrs. They also have my favorite dessert that you can\"t always find. Love it!"}
{"text":"Soup was hot, fresh & oh so yummy and the service was fast & friendly. I'm glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"Lives up to its name, unforgettable!!!  Though the place looks cheap, the food is incredibly delicious. The waitress are really sweet and customer oriented.  This is my first time here and would definitely recommend reading the review to try this place.  I had a rice vermicelli pho with tofu and veggies. The veggie broth was pure delight added to it the veggies and tofu was right steamed and stir fried.   One of the best Vietnamese food!!"}
{"text":"Ok.... so first the good, very clean, great location, tons of options, friendly staff. All super important. So why the three stars??? Well, while the pho is good it is not mind blowing. It's everything pho should be and the portions of meat they give are very generous. But it's not that pho stock that wraps your soul in warmth.  The real issue I have is that they Nickel  and dime ya to death ( very unattractive in a restaurant) if you want your order to go, .50 if you want your rare steak on the side .50 if you want sliced onions on the side 1$....I get that these things take a little extra time, I've worked in restaurants for many years, but with soooooooo many choices when it comes to going out ( like 10 pho places with in 2 miles) these little extras should be included.  They add so much to the dinning experience, and are if given free would be so much more valuable then the .50 they pocket.  Would I come back?.... if I was in the area maybe.... would I seek it out? Nope."}
{"text":"Food was good, I enjoyed the broth in the Pho but wow was it PRICEY!  I left with 3 Pho take out and spent $36.   Other spots near by that are just as good and a fraction of the price."}
{"text":"I am sorry unPhogettable. I am sorry it took me so long to get here. I was told by many about your greatness, but I still took the longer route. At least I got here and now I am here to stay. Your service is awesome. Our waitress, who I think owns the place, was so helpful. The food was delicious. I had an amazing thai tea that was not too sweet, which they usually tend to be. The vermicelli chicken noodles tasted great. Even the dessert of fruit and coconut was great. I had a wonderful time and will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"We eat pho all over the country. This is our favorite place. The broth is wonderful and it is so meaty. They also have a place on the menu that charges minimal for extras such as sides of streak or added vegetables. The veggies might be an Americanized version, but we love our pho but still need our veggies, so it works for us."}
{"text":"What the Pho? Why haven't I heard about this place sooner? This place is Pho-licous!   My classmate and I ordered:  Pho Dac Biet Bo Vien (Pho with rare steak, well-done flank, marble brisket, tendon, tripe & beef meatballs) Gi Cun (2 Soft Spring Rolls) Soda Chanh (Club soda with fresh squeezed lime juice & ice)  The classmate I went with loves this place. She says its the closest place in Arizona to her bf's San Francisco restaurant. Usually, I only eat Pho and drink water since the portion is too big for me. This time, I ate spring rolls, the ENTIRE bowl of Pho, and drank the lemonade-soda. The soda was sweet and made me want more. I left feeling very full and happy! It was an unPhogettable experience! =)"}
{"text":"Its hard to find real good Pho in town. And this place makes it alot easier. This is place has great vietnamese food. It will make your mouth watery. Typical L.A. asian atmosphere as far as style of the restaurant. But its not really expected when you walk into most asian restaurants. However, what is expected is the food and it is delicious here.   An extremely friendly place. Typical asian family working behind the counter.  Un-phogettable surely lives up to its reputation!   My only problem is that it closes too early.  but I understand for the family reasons."}
{"text":"I love pho. I really do. I love all Asian noodle soups in general now that I think about it - udon, ramen, pho. Yum.  Anyway, unPhogettable!  Excellent excellent service. Super friendly employees that take note of what you want or do not want in your pho. Large portions. Great quality meat. And delectable broth. Though, as I always do, I added a ton of sriracha and hoison to make it even more delicious. Ohmygosh my mouth is watering at the thought.   Also - I'm usually not a huge fan of shrimp spring rolls, I tend to find them somewhat blah, but the shrimp spring rolls here are quite enjoyable!  I will definitely be returning so I can try the bun bo hue :]"}
{"text":"It was neat being able to ride the train over to Mekong Market to finally check the place out. I like Vietnamese food, and thought this would be a great place to try.  My opinion remains mixed of this place after a day of thinking about it. The service is flat out odd. They just walk up and stare at you, as if they are waiting for the next command. No how many for lunch, what do you want for lunch, etc. They just look at you.   I enjoyed my lunch well enough, but what killed it for me and pretty much decided two things is they had shredded lettuce in my dish, and the price. I know the rent here is higher, but it was about 2-3 more than most Vietnamese restaurants per entree."}
{"text":"3.75-4 stars I had the #16 (I think) the veggie Pho.  No complaints. Good service, quick and friendly. I think the only negative about this place is that it closes at 8. If you are looking for a late dinner, this isn't the place. Otherwise, recommend."}
{"text":"Came in right at 9am, why not? Pho for breakfast it is! So I should say we came to place when they very first opened and it was not good. So it's been a few years and since then I must admit, things have changed. Pho has flavor and I actually finish my bowl. Heard they have another location too now."}
{"text":"Ordered take out & they tried to charge me more than double! I ordered Pho Chin $7.75 w/additional cup of soup $1.00. And asked for x-tra limes. They told me the price was 16.89!!! They said they had to charge all this extra prices for take out! WTF??? I've eaten here several times & gotten takeout with always the same things with no crazy extra charges. It was the old woman who told me this charge. Usually I deal w/the young girls or the guy. I will never order/eat here again! Someone get a tight rein on grandma before she pulls this bs w/ other customers. Also found they have Dirty Dining News Report!! Gross!"}
{"text":"Simply the best pho in the valley.  The broth is outstanding.  The owners are always coming around to the tables to make sure you are happy.  The spring rolls are also great.  I have had pho in at least 20 different Vietnamese restaurants around the country and this is the best."}
{"text":"Best Pho place in town. Their secret is in the broth which enhanced everything in the soup especially the rice noodles.  I would drive 20 miles just for their Pho."}
{"text":"One of the best pho place in Phoenix. Absolutely no MSG!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Pho can be hard to find, but they always amaze us. My father and I come here so often the owners know us by name and greet us kindly. I always get the crunchy spring rolls (they're to die for) along with the Shrimp pho. My father gets the meatball Pho. Both are delicious! Since I am unsuccessful with chop sticks the waiters are always able to provide me with scissors so I can use a fork. I love this place and will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"Coming from the Bay Area in NorCal, where my mom had a Vietnamese restaurant for 7 years, I have high expectations and this is one of the first places whereI have enjoyed the pho and the fresh spring rolls!  Delicious and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites when it comes to Pho.  Great food.  Friendly service.  Family owned."}
{"text":"I been here countless times. I think their Pho is very excellent taste as good as my parents make them. However, the pricing on Pho here is very high, where I can go elsewhere and get the same quality, maybe even with more traditional flavored, for cheaper. I would come back but only if I have a really high craving, since it's in Mekong plaza, the Asian supermarket is right next to it. Very convenient spot."}
{"text":"This restaurant is clean, and the Vietnamese food is authentic. The portions are generous, and the service is fast. Nice name for a Pho place."}
{"text":"Being from California and having tried many different pho houses, I was pleasantly surprised with the food quality at unphogettable. I was with a group of 15 people during a pretty packed lunch rush, yet the service was quick and attentive. If I'm ever back in this part of Arizona, then I'll surely go back to eat there. Overall, good prices, good service, good food. Yeah, it was pretty unphogettable."}
{"text":"Best Pho I have had in Arizona!  Great atmosphere, clean and classy. Pho is amazing they were quick efficient and friendly. Spring rolls were to die for. First place in Arizona to rival my favorite place back home in Colorado. The name says it all unPhogetable!"}
{"text":"Been really wanting the try pho. Ready a couple review and this place seamed to have the best reviews for mesa. Place was very clean and  simple. I ordered the #28 that's what the waiter recommend. The restaurant was packed so I was really surprised at how fast the food came out. I would say it was within 10min. I really wanted to try oxtail but that was not an option on the menu so I was a little disappointed. I felt like it was really American and not truly authentic. It had a nice sweet taste to it. Meat was tender. I like the Basile leaves they give you to put in the soup really tops off the flavore. I was just expecting more condiments to come with it. After my food was brought out I never saw the server agen till I waved some one down to get my check. Was a cool place to try happy I did I just wouldn't come back agen."}
{"text":"Best and cleanest place ever for vietnamese food! I highly recommend it give it a try it seriously the best one i have tried so far!! Their service is great they remember you and its very fair in price! I recommend this place for anyone who wants to try vietnamese food!!"}
{"text":"Simply excellent!   Service was excellent and food came out lightening quick.   We ordered several different types of Pho which were all delicious! Thai iced coffee was also splendid. Been there twice in 2 days so far and likely many times in the future. Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"The broth and noodles here are awesome, so fresh! This is my favorite out of all the Pho places I've been."}
{"text":"We tried the S1 Bun Bo Hue which is a fragrant Vietnamese Spicy Beef Noodle soup. The bun bo hue came out well could even be spicier for me.   Spring rolls: they tasted fresh a little over priced 4.50 for only two. I didn't like the peanut sauce because they added coconut milk to it had a funny after taste.  I got the pho #2. Overall not bad we might come back because the restaurant was cleaner & decorated a little nicer  than most pho places. Service could be friendlier & overpriced for a pho place.."}
{"text":"Pho was amazing!!!! This was my first Pho experience, but I loved it! I am coming back!   Had the number #13, lean pork. They gave me a lot, I could not finish it."}
{"text":"We love this place. The owners are super attentive and the service is fast, friendly and efficient. We all have our faves: Veggie Autumn Rolls, the beef or chicken pho, the vermicelli salad with grilled chicken, the fried rice (ask for their housemade chili sauce - WOW!), the fresh coconut drink, the thai tea, the soda water & lime, their dessert with shaved ice and jellied fruits. Gah!! So many good things!! (stop by the bakery next door to take some goodies for tomorrow's breakfast!)"}
{"text":"Delicious! Great service! Our server was very accommodating and told me that I could pretty much order my pho custom made to my specs, with a specific noodle and how much broth, meat and so on..... We have yet to go back since our last visit in the Spring because it's been too darn hot! We'll definitely become regulars when the weather drops below 90! :D"}
{"text":"If vegetarian people wanna try some Vietnamese cuisine this could be your next destination.  Pho that you get here is unbelievable.  Pho is a noodle soup with vegetables. I ordered v4 item with egg noodles. It was awesome. The broth was so tasty that I could have gone for another round. A welcome place for vegetarian people."}
{"text":"Not bad but not great either. My husband had the beef based pho and I had the chicken based pho.  Both were just OK nothing great.  I have had other soups that are far better for far less cost.  I ordered the seafood and veggie and according to the menu, it was to have imitation crab but I did not find a single piece in the dish.  The dish came with 2 shrimp (the best thing in the dish).  The calamari was inedible as it was sooooooooooooo tough. The salmon fish balls had a weird consistency to them and didn't taste anything at all like salmon.  I tried my husbands brisket and preferred mine over his.  He wasn't crazy about his either.  The portion sizes are way to big and if you take it home, it will be no good later because noodle soups become gross later. Not a place I would probably return to.  Just saying..................."}
{"text":"The pho is 4 out of 5 stars. Been over about 10 times, but I don't find myself coming back here often.  The portions are a bit smaller and the prices are a bit higher compared to other Vietnamese restaurants.  Don't get me wrong, this place is worth eating at. But it's not one of my top 5s."}
{"text":"Okay, personally I would give their pho five stars; however, I recently brought a friend here who was not so much into getting soup. He ordered the number 50, which was rice and shrimp. For the price I really thought he would get more food, but it was literally five shrimp that were so incredibly tiny and a scoop of rice. Everyone at the table was frantically taking food off their plates to give to him since there was no way that was going to even fill him up a little bit. The pho is absolutely delicious, but I'll never order anything other than pho here seeing what you get for the price."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this location, and first time trying pho.  The restaurant is busy and clean.  Service is impeccable, there's a constant \"how's everything, need anything else?\" From staff.  Our food was ok, more meat would be better but hey I will come back again and try other dishes."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pho spot in AZ. The beef pho is so flavorful. The service is awesome. The staff is very attentive with drinks, dishes, etc. Will always come back here!"}
{"text":"This did not disappoint!  We were actually going to the Thai restaurant next door.  But then my kiddos wanted pho!  We came at about 7:30pm.  We had to wait for about 5 mins.  The servers were very promptly in getting us our drinks and then orders. We ordered the egg rolls, very good.  Didn't care too much for the spring rolls.  We liked the shrimp past rolls better.    Other than that, the menus is very extensive ---but if you looked around and see what other people got, it was 80% pho!  So yes!  When in doubt, get the pho.  We all got pho and it was pretty good.  The other plus is the 3 bean dessert drink was also yummy."}
{"text":"This was the first place that I tried pho so I did not want to review it until I tried other places as well. Now that I am obsessed with pho and I have tried other places I think this will be the go to pho place in Pho-enix! Don't leave here without trying the coffee either!"}
{"text":"Great name and great Pho what more can I ask for?? :)    I have been going around town since I moved here searching for great Pho as it was a weekly eat back home in Seattle.  Finally I found a place within 15 min of my house to go get some especially to cure the mighty hangover.    The Pho was voted best dish in 2009 here and I can see why.  The broth was full of flavor and the meat was a generous portion and on my order of Pho Tai it actually was rare as it was served to me unlike many other Pho places where it is already cooking in the broth and far from rare upon arrival to me.    The menu had many options on it besides just Pho and I ordered my usual Vietnamese egg rolls which were great as well.  They had shrimp in them so it was a nice seafood twist to the usual pork rolls.    Overall it is a great place to cure your Pho need or cure that hangover.  The only thing preventing it from being a 5 star is that it borders the grocery store and doesn't really capture that separate restaurant vibe it should."}
{"text":"Great food! The pho is phonomenal hehehe the pun. Only complaint service was a bit lacking. But easily improved. Will phoso go again."}
{"text":"Lovely staff! always a plus when dining in.  Tried the meatball Pho and it was very good!! ended up taking more than 1/2 home. Very generous portions! Menu has a good variety as well. They also have other entrees besides pho... but it is called unPhogettable, so try the pho foo, it is quite delish!"}
{"text":"Great menu options, clean and friendly staff.  The prices are a little high for the portions but overall the food quality was good."}
{"text":"For the last 5 years I have eaten at UnPhogettable, I have nothing but positive memories to share.  I ate here when my family and friends came into town for my graduation, and my friend's going away party was held at UnPhogettable. My parents talk about how good the pho was the last time they visited, and my boyfriend thinks their veggie pho is better than anywhere else.  I love that the same waitress that served me 5 years ago is still happy to see me when I come to dine, and I always enjoy the casual conversations I have with the owners each time I visit.  I think I feel like a part of the family when I enter this place, and perhaps that's why this restaurant is unforgettable in my opinion.  My favorite is #21 (seafood pho), but I have had most of the things on the menu by stealing some bites from my friends here and there.  The veggie pho (#23) is refreshing and has a clean after taste.  The rare steak and brisket (#9) seems to be a good choice for a person who has never tasted pho before.  There are plenty of other items on the menu starting from vermicelli bowls and grilled meats.  I think if you want to try some Vietnamese food that is consistently good, UnPhogettable would be a great place for you."}

{"text":"This is the 3rd Vietnamese restaurant I've visited in the area, and my least favourite. I wavered between a 3 and 4 star review. The service was great, which would generally have bumped my review up to a 4, but they were a little too much. We waited for another family to arrive, and even though we informed them that we would let them know when we were ready, I think we were asked if we needed service about 8 times before we finally ordered.   This restaurant is located in the Mekong shopping plaza. Maybe it's because of this that the standard fare is pricier than other places.  We came in with a group of 9 people, 6 adults and 3 kids after the age of 5.   Food: Food was good. The portions are typical, enough for an adult to be full. The kids got their own bowls of food that were more than enough. I think the kids' meals were under $6.  We ordered the spring rolls, which I found were pretty pricey for what they were. Furthermore, the peanut sauce was not very good. The pho was decent, but not something I'd write home about. I ordered a vermicelli bowl with beef and shrimp. It was tasty, but I just felt like some flavour profile was missing.   Their coconut drink is not fresh - beware. Or maybe it is, and they just dump some extra sugar in the drink for fun.   Service: They were great with the kids and gave them pencil crayons and a colouring page for them to play with while they waited for their food. There were too many servers who didn't communicate. Within 5 minutes, we had what felt like every single waiter in the restaurant come up and ask us what we wanted to order."}
{"text":"Love their Pho!  I think they have the best flavored broth out of any other places I have tried.  Their prices are rather high for essentially a bowl of Top Ramen with some brisket, but it's still quite tasty!  When two of us get Pho and drinks, I believe the total is usally around $20-$25.  If money's tight, there are several cheaper options in the area that are still very good.  My only complaint (again) is the price.  Not sure why noodles, broth, and a few slices of meat are so expensive."}
{"text":"Have been to this place many times. Would visit it twice a week. Such a regular that the server already knew my order. Last time I was there I found a worm in my soup. All they did was offer an apology and that's it. Even though I did not even eat half of my food they still made me pay for it. It's unfortunate that the food is good but treatment to loyal customers is so bad."}
{"text":"I ran into this place while looking for an Asian market. I thought the name was funny but it seemed it got good enough reviews...so why the hell not. I tried their egg noodle soup with everything on it including fish ball, salmon, pork, chicken and what not...I was blown away....this I was very good and by far the best I had.  My gf tried the pho...well....nothing special but seem like the same old pho compared to other established pho places. Also their appetizers...I tried their pork sausage rolls....well they were okay.  Overall good service and fair price.G approved!"}
{"text":"I came here with a bunch of my friends after a late night. The service was great and fast. They were super friendly to us! I get my usual pho tai which is super basic with just rare steak and noodles in broth. The broth flavor is decent but not as flavorful as I would like. It's decent quality but I do enjoy other places more. The spring rolls are good and authentic and the sauce is yummy.   Overall, your average pho place. Decently good but not the best I've ever had. :/"}
{"text":"I have a cold and was craving pho and this restaurant lived up to its expectations! Large portions, enough to save some for later and delicious broth! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"An amazing vegetarian noodle soup. The sambal and Sriracha sauces on the table are the best."}
{"text":"Unphogettable is a great restaurant with amazing service. The owner remembered us from when we'd been there the first time. I didn't even think that was possible. :-)  This is a great spot for pho in Mesa, where the options for that are sadly lacking. Their pho has fantastic flavor. If it's your first, definitely try the brisket - you'll love it. We always start with the spring rolls and then go onto our pho.   For the service, I don't think my glass of water or my husband's pop were ever even half empty. The owner stops by all the tables and loves to talk about his restaurant.   This is definitely a place we'll frequent for an inexpensive meal. You really can't beat it."}
{"text":"This is my dad and I favorite lunch spot. Pho-real! Impeccable service and the freshest food. Their spring rolls ate immaculate, fried rice is pretty close to Peruvian friend rice, and their pho is truly unphoghetable. The servers are friendly, the owner always asks you how the food was. Nestled inside the Mekong plaza market this place will meet all your expectations in delicious Vietnamese cuisine."}
{"text":"The service is friendly and fast! The food is delicious. Take out is prepped to be put together at home so it's perfectly cooked. After our second visit the staff recognized us, and not long after they remembered our usual order. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here for the last 3 years.  We were always happy with the food and service.  However, on this Saturday night we left wondering what was happening to the food.  My wife order a pho dish and I ordered a vegetarian noodle dish.  My wife felt like they had cut down on the fresh ingredient dish and noodles.  My dish seemed like they cut down on the tofu and vegetables and the noodles as well.  This is the first time we left disappointed.   We'll give it another try but if they have a repeat performance of tonight we will write this restaurant off."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place! High quality ingredients mixed with family recipes and great customer service. I have been to their original location in Mesa but this location is so close to my office this is my new favorite lunch spot. it is also nice enough inside to also be a great relaxed date night as well."}
{"text":"I ordered vermicelli since I had to get take out and they put their soup in styrofoam. The pho smelled great inside. My order of vermicelli was pricey as  heck and half the box was lettuce. Food was mediocre."}
{"text":"I grew up down the street from Little Saigon in The O.C. and this place is just as good as anything I had there. Even better since it's 4mi from the crib. Seriously, their soup is AMAZING. I used to say Pho Ao Sen was my favorite, and, don't get me wrong, it's good, but this place is REAL GOOD.   On top of the great food, the staff is 110% TOP NOTCH. That place is run with precision and the owner is not only very knowledgeable about their fresh good food, he's one of the nicest guys I have ever met. The staff really makes this place, IMO, it just so happens that they have BOMB PHO.  I go here at least 1x's a week, sometimes more.  Oh, and if you have food allergies, they are 100% on point and can direct you toward items that don't contain gluten."}
{"text":"Yummmmy! I love this place.. Only bad thing is that's in Mekong market (which makes me spend too much money). I would come back because service and pho was pho-nomenial! ;)"}
{"text":"overall it is a great place for pho~ tried their pho NO.7 and S1~  No.7 is unquestionably delicious, especially for a soup-lover like me~ S1 is kinda okay but would be better if it can be spicier~"}
{"text":"Ive only tried the pho, so my review is based only on this.  A little pricier than most of the pho places I frequent, but the portions are a little larger too.  What stands out here is the rich beef broth providing a nice flavor base.  Downside is they could include a little more protein in the pho.  Service is quick and efficient.  We eat here fairly often due to the location at the Mekong Supermarket.  Solid 3 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"Truly unforgettable!!   I've been here easily over 30 times over the course of just a couple of years. I'm a pho-natic and I know great pho when I see, smell, and taste it. I honestly should buy stock in this place - that's how good the pho is! Anyways, I brought two of my besties here last weekend because we were all craving Pho after a fun night out (btw, pho is a great hangover cure!). I got the beef broth-based seafood pho with extra veggies - so delish!! My friends got the chicken pho with extra veggies, and while I didn't try theirs, it certainly looked amazing.   Could not recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The staff is great and they take pride in their food. The pho and vermicelli is delicious! You can't go wrong at this place!"}
{"text":"Was looking to try a new Pho spot in the area and I think I found a place to never go anywhere else.  The location is perfect, you can grab Pho then go next door for ice cream that's a win win situation.  First off lets talk about the Egg Rolls, WOW real fresh crisp bite and amazing taste I would come back just for that.  The place is clean and has a lot of space to eat and relax in with TV to watch.  The staff is very friendly, fast and helpful with anything you need.    The Pho is amazing, the broth is probably the best I've had around town with a good amount of noodles.  The vegetable pho gives you more then enough to fill you and the bowl.   Will be back of course!"}
{"text":"They don't have very many vegetarian options on the menu BUT the veggie pho option is really good. The staff were friendly and attentive. This place is also within an Asian marketplace type of plaza with a grocery store, ice cream, boba and little vendors in the same area. Pretty cool place to go and check out if you haven't.   I had a really good experience here and keep coming back. Just wish they had more vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"One of my fav Pho places in PHX.  It's not as good as what you can find in LA, but it's very satisfying nonetheless.  Great taste, good portion, meat was tender, they use FRESH Pho (not the packaged stuff)....clean environment.  Bun Bo Hue is excellent here as well."}
{"text":"I have to say from a marketing perspective, it was the name that got my attention.  Having said that, I went, and ate.  Coming from TX, my standard is fairly high as we have more than our share of Vietnamese cuisines here.    I got there on a week night with maybe 3 or 4 other tables.  Ordered the combination pho, along with the shrimp/pork spring rolls.  Service was quick as I got my food within 5min of ordering.  First impression was that the size of the bowl seemed smaller than what I've seen, or at least compare to the ones here in TX.  There were only 1 size, so no other options.  Before I put in any condiments and sauce, I always like to taste the soup first as that's usually the most important part of pho.  In this case, I thought the soup has a heavy flavor of tripe.  I ordered the combination, so naturally it has the tripe, which I do enjoy, but just didn't expect the soup itself has that flavor as well.  It was light, and seemed to lack the depth of the typical pho flavoring, with the lemon grass and other flavors.    Overall, it was OK.  Also had the spring rolls.  They too were just OK.  They were quite sticky from what I recall, so not sure if it's been sitting there for awhile?    Overall, I have to say I like the name of this restaurant.  But the food is really just average.  As I was craving some boba drink, but that's one thing they do not have on their menu.  I was also craving a bahn mi, which they also don't have."}
{"text":"We go here pretty much weekly. The staff is super friendly and even remembers my order. Maybe I go a little too much haha.   I get the 15 - the chicken and my girl gets the 13 - beef. There's never mystery meat and the soup is always excellent. I like the consistent quality. The A6 spring rolls are something I HAVE to get each time as well."}
{"text":"For. Pho. I. Eat. Only. Here!:) the only thing is the servers need to have more personality. So shy and quick to leave your table as soon as you ordered."}
{"text":"Very adequate pho, but very bland.  Did the chicken broth which may have been my mistake.  Chicken poached nicely but a little chewy and quite tasteless.  Everything was fresh and amazingly quick."}
{"text":"If you want an authentic food from Vietnam then this is the place. I've eaten here several times and A) the service is awesome B) if your not sure what to order the staff will help you and C) it's always crowded.   I've done most of he appetizers and have not had a bad one. The shrimp rolls are good. The various main dishes all seem the same but each one has subtle flavor differences that make it appear to be a completely different dish.   Can't say enough nice things about this place."}
{"text":"Best Pho in Mesa!! One of my favorite places! Great authentic food, portions are great and the staff is really friendly!! Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Yummmmy!  I get the veggie pho, and its very flavorful and inexpensive.  The broth is fragrant and very delectable.  This is a great place for quality pho with great service."}
{"text":"unPhogettable is PHOnominal! Ok, bad joke aside, this is one of my new favorite Vietnamese restaurants. The food is extremely fresh and after talking with the owner, I found out that they make everything themselves from scratch with no MSG or prepackages meats.   The service was excellent and the cafe setting was very inviting. Although a bit far from my house, I'll make the drive to come back here to eat again."}
{"text":"After bad experience, I will never return.  It is terrible since they didn't meet my expectation and the price is outrageous.  The most difficult part of the Pho is the broth (req 16 hours of preparation) and it tasted like water.  I had to add all kind of condiments to rescue it but can't even eat it.  The restaurant is very slow now and it confirmed what I meant with Asian restaurant.  If your fellow Asians don't patronize the place, it is  because your food did not meet our expectation.  Try across the street to the Rice plate Kim Thanh for their rice dish.  It is night and day."}
{"text":"We now look for a Pho place every time we go on vacation anywhere. Denver has spoiled me since there is one practically on every corner.  We found this one nearby and they were packed at lunch time. There was only 1 size bowl of Pho (what I would call a medium) and I thought it seemed a little on the pricey side, although not completely out of line.  Service was fine here, although I could have used a water refill toward the end and they never came back by.  I ordered the meatball pho and the server asked if I'd ever had it before. I thought that was a little weird, but answered in the affirmative. It did make me wonder if there was something off about it, but it was all fine.  I did NOT care for the taste or texture of the meatballs when they came out. They were very thick cut and really chewy in the center. Did not work for me at all.  I also thought the Pho could've been skimmed a little better, but some places do it better than others, so not too big of a deal.  Overall, I thought it was an okay experience. I don't know that I'd come back and order the meatball."}
{"text":"Great selection of  delicious pho.  Decent prices.  Quick attentive service.  The decor is fairly utilitarian but still the darker colors and authentic Vietnamese decorations make it more than classy enough for a soup joint.  The staff was quick, friendly and attentive.  The fact that there's a great Vietnamese bakery right next door doesn't hurt come desert time, either!"}
{"text":"I am very picky with Pho.. This place was amazing! The cold Vietnamese wraps were the best I have ever had!! The shrimp Pho was incredible! Waitress was very polite. I will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"this place didn't live up to the hype!  I love pho, and usually I am not picky about broth, but I felt the broth here was really flavorless. on top of that, the beef was pretty tough. and for $8/bowl, I wasn't feeling it.  the positives are that the servers are friendly (although a little too pushy - when my friend asked what drinks they had, the server turned to the back of the menu and insisted on reading through every single item; also we were asked 4 different times what drinks we wanted; AND 4 different times if we were ready to order). also they give you plenty of bean sprouts, mint, and lime for your pho. and it is clean."}
{"text":"The name is frighteningly appropriate.   Our Arizonian hosts are former residents of Oahu, a mecca of Asian cuisine. They know their stuff. After visiting just about every place in Scottsdale and the surrounding area they settled on a new favorite. unPhogettable is a clean and modernly decorated mini-mall storefront. For those of you who aren't familiar Pho it's an incredibly flavorful Thai soup that's actually pretty healthy, depending on the preparation and cuts of meat you decide on. This particular place boasts they're MSG and trans-fat free.  When it came time to order I left it up to our the pros, our hosts, and was so pleased with their recommendations. We started with the Soft Spring Rolls, fresh and simple ($3.45) and Egg Rolls (fried to perfection and accompanied by a tangy sauce ($4.95). My entree was a GIGANTIC bowl of Pho with rare steak (a value at $7.50). I could only eat about half of my portion and that was pushing it. So good.  The only thing better was the service. They were incredibly attentive."}
{"text":"So i found this place on yelp and the reveiws were almost phenomenal! I litteraly went in today and was very disapointed. I must have gotten a new server,  she did not know anything about the menu. She literally came by 1x and never returned. I had asked if they had duck and she just looked at me like i was dumb and said \"duck\"? Like wtf lol. So when i did finally get my soup that was 10 bucks came with 2 peices of shrimp, tons of lettuce, 1 small peice of chicken, same with the pork. I was so mad i just ate the noodles and left..ill never come back."}
{"text":"My fave pho place in the Valley!  Not only is the food delicious but the service is top notch and the restaurant itself is beautiful (definitely not a hole in the wall!).  The walls feature murals of bamboo and pretty, artistic photos of women wearing traditional Vietnamese dresses.    The place is family-owned and on several of our visits, the owners have come and chatted at length with us--very nice people!  They WILL remember you.  Being vegetarian, I recommend the veggie pho (selection V4 on the menu), which is like a tofu/veggie explosion in a soup bowl; it has mushrooms, broccoli, cauliflower, snow peas, bok choy, cabbage, and tofu plus the bean sprouts/lime/jalapeños that come alongside.  Really fresh and good!  I also love the vegetarian egg rolls--they're unique in that they come with lettuce and pickled veggies to wrap around them--they're my favorite egg rolls I've ever had hands down!  Recommend this place highly!"}
{"text":"Best pho in Mesa and great service. Make sure you try some of their special Pho's - while the traditional makes great comfort food, the S1 and S4 regional specialties are amazing.  I also love the Bun, especially the Bun bo Nuong (grilled beef), during the summer when I want something cooler and refreshing.  The tables are, for the most part, family style.  You may find yourself sitting next to someone you haven't met before.  Everything is clean and well maintained, and the staff and owner are friendly."}
{"text":"Sitting in the place where Pho Van once ran their business is this familiar face from Mesa.  Guys, it's unPhogettable's second location!  Gone are the tacky strings of light and up goes the vinyl bamboo decals you might recognize at their first location.  Everything is clean, everything is new, and the staff is nice.  It really is a breath of fresh air.  This location is just as solid as the Mekong Plaza location.  We got the Pho Dac Biet Bi Vien and had some Mi Thap Cam.  The broth for the pho isn't as light and clean as some other places but instead is full of meat flavor.  It feels heavy and I was definitely ready for a nap afterwards.  The noodles itself were springy and chewy.  As for the spring rolls and egg rolls, what can really be said?  They're all great.  UnPhogettable has always been in my Top 3 for pho in the valley.  They're not #1 but they make a solid pho.  I wish their second location much success!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite place for Vietnamese food~  Owned by a lovely family, the service here is very friendly and very personal.  Through the owner's lovely wife, I learned how to drink Vietnamese coffee properly!  You may think that's a ridiculous thing to say but it was very motherly, sweet, and completely unnecessarily.  It's the fact that she took the time out to come over and teach me all the finer details of Vietnamese coffee that made the lesson and experience memorable.  Not even my Vietnamese friends had taken the time out to teach me!  Now the food here is truly unforgettable.  I love the bun by far!  It's crisp, fresh, and always leaves me full but not uncomfortably so.  I love their egg rolls and their spring rolls and the rice dishes are always savory and flavorful.    I must admit though there is probably only *one* other place I'd rather go to get pho over this place [because they're cheaper, just as delicious, and portions are just as big], I give this place one more star than the other because they're just sooo sweet and nice here!  The service really makes that one-star difference.  The prices here are a bit higher than other Vietnamese restaurants but the quality and freshness of the ingredients makes up for it.    With the modern decor, delicious food, and great service, what's not to love?"}
{"text":"Truly unPhogettable but in a bad way.  We can't believe this place considers their items as Vietnamese food.   Ordered a special rice dish combo to go, they didn't give us the soup that came with it. When I asked for it they said \"oh you wanted the soup?\" Well, I paid for it didn't I? It's part of the combo isn't it?   Opened it when I got home and I was so disappointed. For close to $12 we were given the equivalent of cafeteria food.   \"Thit Nuong\" is supposed to be BBQ'd meat/pork. Cooked over an open flame, this seems microwaved. The veggies that came with it are lacking so much. You usually get red/green leaf lettuce at an authentic Viet place, here they search you iceberg, same with their springrolls.   I come from Santa Ana (Little Saigon) in Southern Cali. The worst spot there is 10 levels above this place.   The place right across from them is delicious. It costs about 10% more but they are indeed authentic and the food is genuine.   This place is the equivalent to Taco Bell for Mexican food.   They skimp on quality ingredients and serve food that barely qualifies as traditional Vietnamese.  If you want real authentic Pho and Viet food drive to Phoenix on 43rd st. There you will find the most amazing Vietnamese food and the cost is 25% - 35% less than this place.  There's a nice Viet place inside the food court there at Meekong plaza. They are $9 a dish and they do it right.  Please explore all your options. We will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Love love this place!!! It's a cute little place connected to a super market. It's clean and busy!! Great customer service! Everyone is super friendly and attentive! The portions of the pho are huge but it is so delicious ! The broth is so so yummy ! We also get the egg rolls that are so good too! Who knew shrimp and sausage would taste good together!?!"}
{"text":"Worst service I've had in a long time. The waitress was snotty and literally couldn't do the basic math necessary for me to pay my bill (gave her a $20 bill and she sat there like 'um, 20 minus 12.44 is....uh....uh....'). Pho broth was overly salty. It took more than ten minutes to get my bill and I had to go up and ask for it. I will never, ever, go back."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say Unphogettable but it was very good. Service was great. I asked for a chicken broth with chicken and vegetables and there were no veggies but a piece of lettuce floating in there but...the flavor was awesome. My niece had the beef broth with brisket and nephew had one with seafood. We all really enjoyed our Pho."}
{"text":"Excellent!   Great spring rolls  Great Pho  Great service.   Its Photastic"}
{"text":"I use to be a big fan of this place, but in the past year the Pho hasn't been tasting as good as it use to.  I have been eating a lot in the San Gabriel Valley in LA and they have alot of Pho restaurants and I think that's why I don't like this place anymore like I use to.  I will say, though, compared to many other Pho places in Arizona,  this is definitely one of the better ones.  It's also one of the more cleaner ones.  My friends that do cosplay love to meet here weekly love it.  For me, I prefer this Pho place over others in Arizona, but it's still never great compared to restaurants in LA.  The ones I always get is the #1 or #2 menu pho beef bowls.  I do really like the spring rolls, but they are different then normal ones because they use iceberg lettuce in it.   They have a really delicious peanut sauce that you can dip it with! :)    As for the sitting area, there are alot of places to sit and if you come on a weekend, it tends to be a little crowded.  The restaurant is clean and there is plenty of parking.  What's cool about it is that it is in indoor plaza where you can walk out and there is a Asian grocery store and other Asian giftshops."}
{"text":"This place is fine if you can tolerate the Pho-Nazi.  Under no circumstances, put anything in your pho; this includes Sirracha, hoisin sauce, chili sauce, etc.  The Pho-Nazi will be quick to point out the delicate texture, and full flavor of the broth, and how you are ruining it with your application of sauce.  Ok Pho-Nazi:  I am hung over, my eyes focus independantly, and everytime you speak, it sounds like a chainsaw buzzing in my ear.  I oblige you to make you go away.  Then I pour what I want in my pho.  Second attempt on this place was in fact not hung over.  I walked up to a packed restaurant, waited for 5 min. at the hostess stand, and then was waived off, waitress yelling across the crowded restaurant, \"WE ARE CLOSED!\"  Oh well I guess I didn't get the memo.  No posted hours on yelp, and no sign with hours.  Huh.  I guess I should have thought twice about putting sauce in my Pho.    TL;DR:  Don't piss off the Pho-Nazi, and your experience will be fine."}
{"text":"The Best for sure!  I have brought my AP Human Geography students for the last two years to enjoy this cultural experience.  The owner takes time out to explain the menu.  Its clean and just good.  I have yet to have a bad experience there.  I will always go to UnPhogettable.  I will always take my guests to UnPhogetable.  As should you!"}
{"text":"This place is inside an Asian Marketplace and I wouldn't have found it if someone had not recommended it.   The owner, Chan, is really cool and friendly.   I ordered the house fried rice with extra \"meat\". He explained to me how really great fried rice is cooked by hearing it, rather than watching it. He said it had to \"POP\" like popcorn, and that's why theirs is really light and fluffy and NOT greasy at all. He was so right. Some of the best fried rice I've ever had.  I went again a few days later and got another order, it was that good. He recommended I order it next time with my choice of grilled meat on the side because it has it's own sauce and it caramelizes and it's so yummy.  Looking forward to trying more things here.   Bottom line though, good food plus friendly service is a win any day."}
{"text":"It takes an astounding restaurant to motivate me to login online to leave a review. This one definitely deserved it.  I've tried several Pho restaurants in the Phoenix/Tempe/Scottsdale area and this is the best one I've tried.   The Food is amazing, the staff is friendly, the location is always clean, the menu is not overpriced, the selection is great, and the food always comes out very fast. I always leave this restaurant impressed.   If your looking for a great pho experience this the best pick in town, no competition."}
{"text":"I decided to go with spring rolls and after going to a place in California called Brodard and enjoyin Spring Rolls in Vietnam, these were very okay.  It seems like it lacked some fresh ingredients when I tasted the components of the dish.  People seemed to enjoy the Pho, so I will try that next time."}
{"text":"I'm kind of sad to see bad reviews about this place. I fell inlove with it my first trip.  Let me start by saying I don't have much experience with Vietnamese cuisine, but my overall experience of unPhoGettable was fun.  The lack of appetizers do put a bit of a damper on the meal, but not a huge one. My boyfriend and I started off with the fried egg rolls. These were full of flavor and the lettuce I received was chilled, crisp (unlike the other reviewer) and was served with pickled veggies and a sweet sauce for dipping. I'm IN. The owner of the restaurant went over the entire menu for us, told us the most popular dishes and really pointed out the pros and cons of each dish. I went with the Pho w/ brisket. My boyfriend got the Pho with all the meats in there. It came with bean sprouts and basil on the side. I was stuffed by the time I left. I couldn't believe how much food was in that bowl. There was no way any one person can finish off a bowl of soup like that.   Give this little place a chance."}
{"text":"Came in with a party of 6 before the dinner rush. We had to wait a few minutes for seating, which is more than fine since we had more people. Everything started off great, water was given and orders taken. I am looking around and people are getting their food and appetizers. We waited 35 mins before ANYTHING came out. When the food came out only 4 bowls came out in which 1 was incorrect- one was sent back and they still needed clarification on what we all ordered. Second round, they brought out 2 more bowls of the correct order. I waited an addition 5 mins for my food to come out... and they gave me a kid bowl at this point, I was so hungry I didn't care and I told them to give it to me.  They only brought out 2 out of the 6 accoutrements (basil, sprouts, lime and jalapeño) until they were asked to bring out more. None of the pho bowls had cilantro or onion in it.   Not the mention while our party waited... an employee was walking around collecting hoisin and sriracha bottles and squirting/consolidating them in the seat next to me. The same employee fussed at another employee in Vietnamese for wiping down the table too much.   Service today was off... exceptionally off. Food was good, possibly because my stomach was eating itself."}
{"text":"Good service and even better Pho!  Large portions and very flavorful!  It's not often that Pho fills me up, but I left full after my meal!    Lucky for me that I reside nearby their sister location in Virginia Beach!"}
{"text":"Not only was my Pho here unforgettable, it was no doubt pholicious! This particular Vietnamese dish is one of my all-time staples that I cannot live without!    As usual, I always order a bowl that includes \"rare\" steak, meatballs, and beef brisket while stuffing it with all the fresh veggies that normally comes with it, like the sprouts, Asian/mint leaves, and squeeze of lemon.  Interestingly, they did not have cilantro! Maybe they ran out? Hopefully that was the case, because it is a MUST! Lastly, I like to drizzle hoisin to give it a more rich sweet taste and the universal hot sauce that seriously can be put in just about anything, Siracha! Voila, I'm ready to slurp away!  The steak, meatballs and beef brisket were soft and tender, the way it always should be.  I thought the broth was quite good--the level of saltiness was balanced and tasted smooth. The broth is the key to a great Pho! if you do not agree, I would like to hear from you! :)  The noodles themselves, I thought were also really good actually.  I do not normally comment on the noodles because I always thought they tend to be \"standard\" and the same across the board.  Not in this case.  It was prepared perfectly and had an aromatic tasting hint to it--you do not want soggy noodles EVER!  I cannot go further without discussing the etiquettes of slurping Pho.  At this particular time, I happened to notice across me, two tables down to my left, a couple eating Pho, in probably the most bizarrest, unorthodox kind of way.  #1, who splits a Pho bowl?! To me that's a NO, NO.  To make this sound even more disturbing, they either slurped all the broth already or they dumped it out onto another bowl.  My good eyes saw that it looked like only the solid ingredients were left over.  Both people basically chopsticked their meat and noodles out onto their plate, A PLATE! Then, after that, they would examine their pieces of meat and it appeared like they were picking it apart or something and then devouring whatever they thought looked good???  To properly eat Pho, all you do is using either a fork or chopstick, grab your noodle and meat/veggies (bare minimum) and try to fit it into your Asian spoon.  After that's done, you may slurp away.  I like to take it a step further by also scooping the broth into the spoon so I can get the full taste.  For once, I have exhausted my brain and fingers typing this review. *sigh*"}
{"text":"This is the best Pho in the valley. We drive 45 minutes to get here. We have been here many time & they never disappoint! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"What a great place. I had the fried rice (by accident -- thought I'd pointed to the fried noodles, which I'll get next time). I'm a vegetarian, and there are plenty of veggie options. The fried rice was awesome with fried tofu and their hot sauce.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I came here twice for Pho and the food was delicious. The broth for the noodles was absolutely delicious with little to no grease. It is definitely one of the best in the east valley (in my opinion). However, waitresses are not very attentive and wish it would have been better. Nevertheless, I will still come back for the food and hope that their service will improve over time."}
{"text":"Food flavor is ok, service very good, portions very small, price higher.    Why 3 stars?, because The owners lately charge more and gives less portions."}
{"text":"Best Pho I've had! Fresh ingredients and broth and noodles just right.  Staff is very friendly and food comes out fast."}
{"text":"We had a great lunch.  The pho was very good, Bun Bao was superb, and the egg rolls very tasty.  I would return."}
