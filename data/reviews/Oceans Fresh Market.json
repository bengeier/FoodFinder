{"text":"Was here for first time today. Read reviews and agree with some.  Produce: amazing variety that I haven't seen except at St. Lawrence Market downtown. Fruits and vegetables ontarians are used to plus those from many Asian countries and India. And unique varieties like large fire plums and Vidalia onions from Georgia. A million different greens. Fruits like dragon fruit, pomegranate, persimmon, cactus pear that were at reasonable prices.   Fish: had a fish market in a separate little enclave. Reminded me of fish mongers in new York I used to shop at.   Meats: great prices on all kinds of fresh meat, huge variety. Had whole duck for $13, a big bag if chicken bones for soup for $1, 8 skinless boneless chicken thighs for $5.50. Had beef shanks, 5 different kinds of liver, pork cut in 15 different ways. Beautiful!   Prepared foods: had a hot food counter with just prepared items like har kow (steamed shrimp dumpling), shumai (steamed pork dumpling), BBQ pork buns, turnip cakes, spare ribs. Lots of goodness there.   Sauces: of all nature and spice. So amazing I'm saving it for next time as too much to look at.   Having been used to markets like this in NY and CA, it's great to have one here. Inside store design kind of reminds me of Whole Foods.   Customer service: don't expect anything extraordinary in this category. Doesn't exist here. If you can get passed that, there's great products and great prices here!"}
{"text":"The bubble tea here is really good. Whenever I have to go grocery shopping, I usually choose Oceans, mainly because I want to get the bubble tea from here, LOL.  But aside from that, they also have a wide selection of foods and fresh vegetables. Their buns are always soft and fresh too.  They have good deals on their take out and dim sum, and they even have a dining area in the back section of the store.  I bought a tray of sushi for only $22 and it came with lots of california rolls, dynamite, and salmon, and it was actually pretty good!  The only thing I have to complain about is that it smelt like gross bathroom near the back, but the rest of the store was fine."}
{"text":"My sister worked at this location the kitchen is nasty. She told me they drop food on the ground and throw it back into the cooking pan. It may be cheaper but it is so dirty I would rather pay a little more."}
{"text":"LOVEEE the bubble tea here! They use fresh fruits whenever they can. I always order a mango or pi√±a cola smoothie with tapioca and they use fresh mangoes and pineapples and use the powder for the coconut... It's a lot better than those place that only use powder for their bubble tea. It's approximately $5 for a small smoothie with tapioca... which is usually the price anywhere, but they always have specials for the week which are $1.99 or $2.99. Sometimes the staff are quite rude, but oh well"}
{"text":"Its great and huge Chinese store, which has it all! you pick anything and they have it and more. I was in their to get mu spring roll fix!  Their bakery section is not bad and the service there is good. I love their spring rolls, so I have used their food section as well and although always busy they do tend to keep people moving and provide warm food. This location had a bubble team and fresh juice section as well! The also have a seating area so you can eat at the location.  Over all the place is a bit dirty but hey its because of traffic in and out of the store and as they have many sections.  The counter service could be better but then again their are quite a few customer to be checked out and usually many till are always running.  Over all I quite enjoy shopping their for few stuff here and there as not all is cheap compared to other supermarkets."}
{"text":"The fruits and veggies are cheap. I don't buy any meat from here cuz it grosses me out. They have a Chinese hot table..a dinner costs 4.99. The food is really good, big portion size"}
{"text":"Every Friday after I'm done pumping iron, I go down the street and shop at Oceans. It is normally really busy and they have these little red plastic carts which I like because it takes up less room and it's easier to manoeuvre around the isles. I enjoy coming here because of the great prices and the variety of fresh fruits and vegetables. I haven't really shopped for anything else so I can't really say what they do and don't have. Oceans is your standard grocery store and smells funky at times haha sorry. At check out they only take cash or debit, I honestly don't know why but just make sure you have one or the other -speaking from experience, I once had to mission it home so I could get cash. Anyway, it's a grocery store and there isn't much I can say other than, if you need to make a salad? Come here for your greens ;)"}
{"text":"Anytime I visit Brampton I ALWAYS go to Oceans for all the great Tropical fruit.  From Milk fruit, rose apples, YELLOW dragon fruit!    This place is great.   The only bad thing is they don't accept U.S credit card or cash.   Sometimes I'm limited because I didn't have enough Canadian and can't buy all the goodies I'd like."}
{"text":"The rating is based on my order from the Hot Food counter but quickly, the produce and selection of grocery items seems to be pretty good, on par with other large Chinese Supermarkets (ie. T&T, Bestco, etc...). The hot food is another thing though. In short, it's \"marginal\". I had chicken fried rice, black pepper beef, fried chicken wings and hot and sour soup. The fried rice was poor, but what you'd expect of Manchu Wok quality. The black pepper beef was tasty but lacked authenticity, not enough black pepper and too sweet for my taste. The wings were ok, of the battered type, but were a little soggy. The hot and sour soup was also mediocre, tasted watered down. T&T is the benchmark for chinese supermarket hot foods and Oceans falls way short."}
{"text":"Wooo! I like this place.  Groceries are so cheap here! I got cherries for $2.99 a pound! I got fish, plates for soya sauce (for dipping sushi), koala cookies, rice paper, a sushi rolling mat, and sushi for $38!!! Unreal. At the end of the day the sushi is half price. $1.99 for 6 california rolls, $2.99 for spicy salmon. Omg. They were so good. I have gotten them twice. Excellent! I can't believe I waited so long to try this place!!!"}
{"text":"I love buying my groceries here and some delicious eats at the hot plate bar/resto especially their dim sum and bubble tea! Their dim sum is actually pretty good considering it's not in a more reputable \"restaurant\", particularly their siao mai and squid tentacles (my fave in this location!). Since they were bought over from Loblaws, I've noticed that the prices have increased a little but still fairly priced grocery items compared to other grocers and staff have become a little more polite, especially the cashiers and hot plate servers.  There is still a big language barrier with stocking staff and sometimes a little attitude so you're honestly better off finding something yourself.  Also, the parking lot is truly a ZOO so be careful and practice courtesy (hopefully others will follow suit... *wishful thinking*)."}
{"text":"Horrible service, overcrowded with rude people, but amazing prices that other stores can't beat. Also don't take credit cards, need changes for the shopping cart and paid shopping bag."}
{"text":"Love coming to Oceans. Not only do I love dinning out but I love to cook. Oceans takes care of the majority of my grocery needs.   Jerk chicken and pork are on the menu. All fresh ingredients and making it from scratch.   This location is typically busy at given point during the day/evening. So pack your patience. The tellers can be a little more friendly, hence the 4.   But I'll keep returning."}
{"text":"Produce is pretty good. Selection is alright. T&T meat department is better. The type of people that shop here are not my type of people. Have fun crossing the street to get to the doors because cars don't like to stop for pedestrians here. But at least produce is cheap and fresh."}
{"text":"Ok, here is the deal with Oceans. If you want fresh fish, veggies, cheap tasty hot plate or dim sum hit up your local oceans. If your not looking for old ladies horking there flem or gauze while pushing people in the check out line then you may want avoid going anytime besides when it first opens for the day.  Again, the prices on really fresh fish cannot be beat and there specials are great, just understand what your getting into."}
{"text":"For Brampton, this is a great Chinese/Asian supermarket but when you compare it to the rest of the GTA, it's just not that great.  There's another Oceans in Mississauga on Hurontario and the quality is notably different.  Considering they're only maybe 15 minutes away on the highway, you'd think they'd be using the same suppliers but this one has more wilted looking items than my lawn in a drought.  Parking is a bit chaotic here.  I'm not sure if it's the drivers or the layout of the place but I think it's the drivers (Sorry Bramptonites!).  People are darting in front of your car regardless of what you're doing.  Once you stop cursing at people and you're inside the market, you notice the lighting is a bit off.  I think it's the lack of natural light but it has that odd haze from too much florescent lighting.  This place is large (like all the other Oceans markets) and right off the bat, you're hit with the whiff of the fish (and not in a good way).  They had salted fillets standing out and it didn't smell pleasant.  There was a lot of fish in the tanks and they seem all fine swimming about but the tanks itself seemed to be not great condition.  The Oceans on Hurontario almost seems brand new in comparison (even though it's been there for a few years now).  The meat area here was in the same condition.  It's not spotless and the meat felt like it was thrown about here.    The English and Asian vegetables weren't too bad here.  Same thing goes for the baked good section.  I noticed this market really catered to the south Asian community more as it had several aisles dedicated to those cultures.    Checkout was a bit frantic as it seemed like everyone was in a roller derby to get their carts into the line ups.  The cashiers all seemed to going through the mechanical process of scanning but it's no different from any No Frills I've been to.  Overall the prices are fair and the selection is decent, I just wasn't a fan of the meat or fish area of this market.  I wouldn't buy anything as it didn't seem to be well handled.  I could take that risk but I fear my stomach probably wouldn't recover from it."}
{"text":"Great prices for affordable groceries, the bubble tea is really good here.. That's why I put 4 stars :)"}
{"text":"Oceans Fresh Food Market has a convenient location right by Hwy 410.  I don't have Oceans Fresh Food Market in my hood.. but definitely they reminds me of T&T or Foody Mart.  Mixture of different ethnic food plus Western and Canadian offerings. There is this Deli that sells cold cuts and cheese.. that that usual for a \"Oriental\" grocery store.  For the cooked food, there are a lot more Vietnamese varieties. Of course the standard Dim Sums, bubble teas, sweet and sour pork.. :P There is a little area where people can just dine in.  Oceans Fresh Food Market is trying to be a supermarket for all: Jamaican, Filipino, Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, Canadian... so it can really be your one stop grocery shopping experience!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Ocean's since they first opened. The lunch special with a pop and a soup was originally $5.50 with any 3 options. Now it's almost $8.00 with 1 meat and 2 sides.  Last time I went I got a bunch of \"singles\" which are plastic containers of each of the displayed varieties. You have to be careful with the portions because they's stack for example the noodles, and then when you tap the bottom of the plastic container to settle the food, there'll be just over half the container empty. The other thing I noticed is they pay no attention to hygene and cleanliness. I saw them drop the tong on the floor and she picked up and started using it again without properly cleaning it. When they exchange the trays from the kitchen, I also noticed they'll remove the existing tray and empty the remaining food into the new batch. The way they perform this is a problem because all the dirty water and reminence underneath the old tray drips onto the new batch when they hold it over to transfer the previous left overs into the new batch. I looked in the warm water when they removed the old tray and noticed it's not actually clean water for consumption, it's utility water in a tank that's strictly used for keeping the metal food trays warm from underneath.  And lastly, what totally turned me off is when I went to the washroom one of the cooks with the white apron went to the urinal beside me, and left without even washing his hands. I don't know how they get away with how they operate in this manner, mind you the demographic of customers they cater to are of a certain wealth and status category - perhaps this permits lax health and safety standards."}
{"text":"great place to get groceries, great place to grab some food from the \"hot plate\" bar  my only complaint is the workers have a bit of attitude and some of them are not very helpful if you have questions or a problem.  always busy and the parking lot is a bit of a zoo, so pay attention when your trying to find a spot."}
