{"text":"How can they refer to their place as a banquet hall? 

From the getgo these people, in particular Reza kept making empty promises, first he said everything in the room can be used, then we come to find out we can't use the speakers or set, we couldn't even rent it.  The most shocking was not being able to use a proper sink or even a fridge. 

We were told to use the bathroom sink when handling food!! That was absolutely disgusting! That violates the food handlers health code.

Then a few days before our event (my mother's retirement and 75th bday dinner party) we asked if we can come in earlier to decorate (mind you when we signed contracts he said if nothing is going on we can get in earlier) he said he doesn't know so we asked him how much $$ and he told us he would charge us $50 for the extra hour. The day before I call to no answer a couple times... then he gets his secretary to call and she tells us it's $150 for the hour!

These people are very un Christian like and have no customer service. I would never recommend this place to anyone unless they make changes."}
{"text":"There is a nice selection of books, music and videos here plus a whole range of other items, the focus is on the Christian faith. There are also live events that happen here like book reading by the authors. The last time I was here on a Saturday there was a children's book author having a reading. 

Every time I come here it is with the intention of getting a specific book or documentary and when I leave I have bought a few other things as well. The atmosphere here is relaxed and I actually enjoy the experience. 

This for me is also a nice place to get a gift, for any occasion really. I have gotten some nice gifts here."}
{"text":"First off, I should specify that this is quite a unique space based on my initial experience.  From what I can gather, it is a (1) bookstore, (2) event space that can be rented, and (3) cafeteria with board games.

On December 20th, my wife and I rented out the event space section to use for my daughters first birthday. My wife really wanted a bookstore to match her Alice in Wonderland theme. After a lot of searching, this place was perfect.

We had roughly 100 people attend, and the space and staff were very accomodating at handling our large group size.  I should specify that all of our food and children's entertainment was provided by us.  

In addition to the event space, the other thing I really liked was the cafeteria section, which was very casual for anyone that wanted to grab a drink and just relax.  We love board games, and this was the only place in Scarborough we know of that has a stack you can borrow for free to play with.

Lastly, the name was a bit deceiving for us at first as it suggests religion based.  I'm not a very religious person myself, but found the space (excluding the bookstore section) to be very neutral for anyone in need of an event space, or coffee shop setting to relax.

Overall, a great venue worth checking out."}
{"text":"Such a cute place!! I actually mainly come for their cafe. It's a really quiet and nice place to study or chat. They always have pastries, coffee or soup available too. (Whenever the Starbucks next door is too full, I just pop in here) Their employees are super friendly too!:)"}
