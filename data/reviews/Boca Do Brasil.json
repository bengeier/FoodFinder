{"text":"My bf really wanted pizza so we decided to try this place out. The service is terrible and the pizza was the greasiest thing I have ever seen. The combo is a can of soda and nothing else. I am never coming back here again!!"}
{"text":"Great place and awesome prices.they good it's very good and tasty, their milanesa it's very good"}
{"text":"The most authentic e gostoso Brazilian food around! Owned by a Brazilian family from Brazil who is friends with many other Brazilian families in the community. You know if all the Brazilians go there on a weekly basis it is legit!"}
{"text":"Went here today to get some Brazilian bites.  This place is great!  For anyone who's been to Brazil or even wants to try some tasty authentic Brazilian food, this is the best place in town.  Prices are a bit on the high side but nothing unreasonable.  Ambience is a little lacking, just some tables and plain walls, but the service was good considering it was standing room only.    We tried the coxinhas and pasteis as well as the obligatory can of authentic Guarana, and everything was great!"}
{"text":"Excellent Brasilian food , atmosphere and service .  Clean and Delightful energy .  Local Treasure ."}
{"text":"Simply delicious!  Homemade food, great coxinha, awesome fresh passion fruit juice and keep place for the coconut pie!  So different to go to an independent restaurant that is family-owned and not another sterile franchise!"}
{"text":"Delicious, home cooked Brazilian meals! My husband and me have come here previously for lunch and decided we wanted to try them for dinner. They are inexpensive and very tasty. When you first enter the restaurant, grab a menu from the cashier stand and take a seat yourself (if there is no waitress) because sometimes the waitress is tied up in the back. As I said the food is awesome! I had the Chicken Stroganoff which was a totally different version then what im used to! It was made with a tomato based cream sauce and no noodles but served with rice. It was AMAZING. I actually enjoyed it more then the traditional Stroganoff. My husband got the Gyro which he loves, ALWAYS! Perfectly seasoned meat, great portion! We will definitely keep on coming here!"}
{"text":"Good food and good price but very simple place! It could be better organized!! I tried the piranha and I liked it very much! Plus they have guarana"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Dont expect to find a fancy brazilian barbacue restaurant. This is a simple but authentic brazilian lancheria!! The flavor is just like back home. The waitress(Heitor) was so nice to me. The coxinha is huge and pastel is made to order, fresh and still swizzling!! A must try for anybody wondering about the real flavor of Brazilian food this is the place! Oh btw prices is very reasonable!!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews about this place but went anyways because I love authentic Brazilian food, and I was pleasantly surprised.   The atmosphere is definitely more laid-back than a fancy restaurant, but we had no problems with the service and the food was great; good portions, great flavors.   The server was friendly and more than accommodating  when we requested a few extra things (a side of rice and beans for our little girl, etc.). The wait for food was what you'd normally expect, and it was nice and hot when we got it.   Portions were good too. Neither my wife or I could finish our meals.   Be sure to try the Coxinha (chicken with the catupiry cheese), and ask for some farofa to put on your rice and beans. The dessert cake (chocolate coconut with condensed milk or something) was amazing."}
{"text":"They have a $5 Gyro special that lured my friend and I there yesterday. It was serviceable but not the best Gyro by far in Vegas. I think this place suffers from an unfocused menu. They seem to be a Brazilian restaurant and not a Greek restaurant like they were in the past. The service was a bit slow as well, but nothing to really complain about."}
{"text":"Never Had Brazilian Food, but this was the perfect place togo first. The guy at the counter is really great, every time we go he's got a great attitude he always helps out with telling us whats what and if wasn't for him this place wouldn't be the same. Food is always great! Me an my wife get the breaded chicken it was perfect, the beans were good too."}
{"text":"I went to this place with my Brazilian friend, so we were both looking forward to eating there. Unfortunately, it was pretty bad. I ordered the steak dish and the steak was paper thin and extremely dry. It was like eating paper. The salad and French fries weren't that great either but were edible. I got the Coxinha, which was a surprisingly heavy fried potato ball, which didn't have much flavor and little bits of chicken in it. Then, I got one of the Brazilian drinks and tasted really watered down. Another major problem was that they were out of several things I wanted to order, and they were the true Brazilian types of dishes. This rarely happens when I go out to eat. The service was fairly good, and the waitress (maybe owner) was very friendly, speaking English very well. However, this place was big disappointment for both my friend and me. Since I've gotten to know several Brazilians in the past few years and heard much about their food, I was looking forward to trying some good food. My friend, who's been away from home for several months, too was excited to get a good cooked meal from his country. Sadly, that didn't happen."}
{"text":"We got an amazing flatbread sandwich that had steak and ham and fried egg etc. on it. It was like a Brazilian French dip on steroids. We've eaten a lot of sandwiches, both of us agreed it was the best sandwich we have ever eaten. I can't speak for the rest of the food but we're hooked."}
{"text":"I wanted to say something good about this place, I really did! I got their highest priced plate, the Saturday special which was a slow cooked, bean and pork base soup with some added spices. For price point of $18, I feel it fell way short. It tasted like canned black beans that were not fully rinsed, which combined with the salty pork..I like salt, but damn...Maybe 4-6oz tops of actual meat, which for a Brazilian place, I felt was a little light. Again, I don't think it was worth it for the price. It was a $12 plate tops, for the experience it brought.   Other little things: No water offered, no extra vegetables as asked for."}
{"text":"Great Food, Awesome Service, recommended! Plus for the servers!"}
{"text":"The food is always great, especially the Brazilian specials and pizza.  Super friendly staff and quick delivery."}
{"text":"My favorite Brazilian restaurant in town. It tastes yummy feels like I'm back home! Love it!"}
{"text":"This was my first time having Brazilian food and it was really good. I had chicken and  cheese Pastel and a #9 both were delicious. The service was good as well, quick food and a good waiter. I look forward to trying more Brazilian restaurants and coming back to Boca De Brasil"}
{"text":"Almost 30 min to get my food....i guess it takes longer to make beef strogonoff....it was good.....but food took to long"}
{"text":"This is a very small and simple restaurant in a busy strip center.  The food is overpriced and the portions are small.  The food is not bad.  It is also not great.  I went with a friend from Brazil who said their black bean special stew was the mainstay of the Brazilian diet.  She said it was fair at best."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great food, great service, the staff are very nice n friendly. We had a great salad, pizza n gyro all for $20! I will def go back!!!"}
{"text":"An amazing little spot for Brazilian food! Not only Brazilian food  but they also have GREAT pizza. The cashier who also served as a waitress was awesome. She was so friendly, explained the food and was on top of her work as well."}
{"text":"This is a great place to taste the brazilian homemade food. The waiters are the best and the owners also. Try the Feijoada on Saturdays."}
{"text":"So I decided to try something brand new and Brazilian food sounded very interesting for me. I made the biggest mistake of my life. This is my first experience with Brazilian food but I'm sure this place does not do it justice.  When I walked in, the lady told me she would be right with me and walked to the kitchen for a good 10 minutes. Then another customer came in and she took his order right away ahead of mine. Again, after taking the second customers order, she told me she would be right back.  Just when I was about to leave she comes back out and asks \"what do you want?\" I the rudest tone you can imagine.  I had a lamb gyro combo which included salad, fries, the gyro, and a drink.  I was surprised when the wait wasn't long since she made me wait so long already. Then I realized why it was so fast.  I'm not joking when I say the lamb pieces looked like microwaveable sausage patties. The fries looked like microwave food as well. I figured I should be open to all types of food, but this place has almost scarred me for life. I hope I can find a place to change my mind about Brazilian food."}
{"text":"This place is whack, don't waste your time! If you're lookin for that Mom and Pop's fabulous experience you WON'T find it here. This place has no music while dining, has no menu when you walk in, and gives you a lousy canned soda with your order. This place simply has no experience worth remembering. Don't be fooled by the special posted in the window. I've had better carnival food! Save yourself the hassle and walk 2ft over and get yourself a killer teriyaki bowl from Yogi's!!"}
{"text":"I lived in Brazil for a few years and they have authentic Brazilian food that I would have eaten at anyone's house or restaurant.  My favorite item on their menu is the coxinha, that is a must have if going!  The staff and owner have always been nice or good, would recommend going if you want authentic Brazilian food."}
{"text":"Beirute Sandwich is now one of my favorite sandwiches.  It's amazing.  Service was even better.  Friendly, and provided anything we needed plus more to make me want to go back there time and time again. Can't wait to try everything else on the menu.  Everything looked so good. Order the cheese bread from the appetizers."}
{"text":"Pastel (Cheese Empanada) super delicious! Very authentic, and they are great at explaining the menu and making recommendations, i found a new favorite! Oh and Brazilian cheese bread  wow!"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend anyone here who is looking for authentic Brasilian food!  My grandfather lives in Brasil and I have been there many times.  The food here reminded me exactly of being back in Salvador.    The Coxinha was delicious and it's the first time I've found it in the United States.  It's hard to explain what it is.  It's a deep fried potato with breading and chicken in the middle. While my description doesn't do it justice, it is a must try!   The menu had many options and was at a very reasonable price.  The service was beyond suburb and it was refreshing to see native Brasilians working there.  I forgot his name, but he was very attentive and friendly.    I highly recommend giving this place a try!  It's nothing like the recently popular churrascaria.  So please don't go to the restaurant thinking of Texas de Brazil or Viva Brasil.  This is authentic street and home food that the majority of Brasilians eat."}
{"text":"Driving on Fort Apache, turned into the driveway and looked for a parking spot. Didn't plan on going here but since KFC and Taco Bell are available almost on every corner, Why not try another Pizza Spot..  One of Worst Pies I ever laid my teeth on:  Medium Pepperoni Pizza: I watched them pull out the pre-prepared pan already stuffed and flattened with dough. Hmm.. I haven't seen this in a while.. Well, can't judge by that alone but I can judge it after I have it! Crust was as thick as a pizza hut pan pizza, more on the thick side but not real deep dish. The dough had an awful flavor and consistency was similar to those microwavable Celeste pizzas! Cheese didn't taste any better. Pepperoni were spread evenly and not loaded, also tasted cheap in my opinion.  I thought, Marcos Pizza was the worse pizza I've had But this place makes them look good?! Just telling it how it was.. (I did try this place a while ago, so maybe they changed their ingredients or recipe..)"}
{"text":"Best brazilian restaurant ive ever been in USA. Amazing food and service! You have to try the Coxinha appetizer and Picanha as main course."}
{"text":"Bom lugar para você que quer comer comida de verdade e não as porcarias que os americanos engolem diariamente."}
{"text":"Home to one of my favorite sandwiches: the Beirute. It's what I get every time I come here, and worth every penny.   Boca Do Brasil is not the cleanest restaurant and service can be hit or miss (mostly hit), but the food has always been on point for me. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Finding a Brazilian spot with authentic dishes that doesn't involve huge peices of meat being walked around is a Lil more difficult than u would think.    Tucked away in the back of a little plaza this gem of a place originates home cooked Brazilian food. We were greeted by a very friendly lady and seated right away. She welcomed us and asked if we had been there before. We said we hadn't and then she went on to explain the menu and what was popular.   Cheese bread, incredibly good. Try it!! Got to try the Pastels (a fried pastry witg meat) and Coxhinas (fried potato with mixings) traditional dishes. They were really tasty. Guarana soda is like a sweet ginger ale."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place for dinner a couple weeks ago while we were in the area. It's not the most glamorous place but we had a great experience, mainly because we love Brazilian food.   It was a Sunday evening so we were trying to find items on the menu besides feijoada since it was listed as a Saturday special. However, we were told by our server that it was still available. Yay! My wife got the feijoada special, while I tried the picanha. Everything tasted great and was very flavorful. The picanha could've been cooked a little more rare since it was nearly well done, but it had plenty of fat on it which still made the steak super tasty! Both entrees were $16.99 each, which seemed a little steep for a hole in the wall spot.  Will likely be back in the future when I need to get my Brazilian fix. My only gripe about this place is that it's a little pricey, but I guess what Brazilian joint isn't?"}
{"text":"You can't fake a place like this. My first impression is always how clean the pace is, it shows that the staff takes pride in what they're trying to accomplish. Secondly the food is off the hook great. Simple done well with excellent flavor.   I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Walked in because it smelled amazing..walked out because we received no service after waiting 10 minutes.  Maybe I'll try it again, then again, no."}
{"text":"Delicious! Have come here many times over the years whenever I'm craving authentic home style  Brazilian food for takeout and dine in.   The decor is very casual, the staff extremely friendly (even if you don't speak Portuguese!), and the service prompt.  Highly recommend trying the: - mandioca (an appetizer a bit like fries that are slightly sweet) - beef or cheese pastels (an appetizer sort of like a fluffier version of an empanada) - coxinhas (an appetizer sort of like tastier versions of chicken drumsticks) - chicken milanesa (an entree, imagine a chicken parmigiana-esque dish) - picanha (an entree, essentially a good cut of steak with great seasoning)  All their entrees come with seasoned rice, salad, and a hearty portion of beans. Don't forget to ask for some farofa to be sprinkled on your entree - I can't do without it!   My only complaint: the beans are a bit on the salty side!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick, small bite to eat before the gym. We split a Frango E Catupiry Pastel (chicken and catupiry filled thin pastry). which was delicious. Boyfriend had the gyro, which he enjoyed but I noticed is on the smaller side.   I ordered the chicken fingers with fries. Not the greatest chicken fingers, likely frozen, but the two stars comes from what happened after I started cutting my chicken in half to let it cool down faster. One piece was very undercooked so I put it off to the side to let the waitress know when she came back out. The rest seemed fine so I ate those while I waited; good thing, since my boyfriend was already finished with his gyro by the time she showed up again. When we politely told her that everything was good minus the undercooked piece of chicken (I showed it to her), rather than apologize and offer to get me a new one, she gave us an annoyed look like we were bothering her and instead got a plate for me to deposit my already-cut-in-half piece of chicken onto and she brought it back to the kitchen to be cooked more. When she came back, she dropped it off at the table with still no apology. What the heck??  The more traditional Brazilian dishes looked pretty good and decently priced, and we were thinking of coming back to try. However, after the off-putting experience of having a piece of chicken taken back to the kitchen to be recooked after I already cut into it and the lack of basic customer courtesy, we will not be coming back.   An odd set up, as the place is very tiny and casual but is run restaurant-style."}
{"text":"Everything we order is great: kitchen and catupiry pizza, coxinhas, pastel, chicken parmigiana. The dulce de leche pastel is to die for. We always come at least twice when we are in town. Authentic Brazilian food!"}
{"text":"Took a colleague to Boca Do Brasil today who lived in Brazil for 4 years. He liked the numerous foods they had for sell and even got a case of guarana.  We looked over the menu and I ordered a pastel de carne for appetizer. The coxinha is also great here and comes with cheese or cheese and chicken. I chose the lunch special chicken milanesa and he ordered the pizza portuguesa. For drinks he had an acerola juice and I ordered a guarana. Very good local Brazilian beverage.  The food came out quickly and I ate every last bit of rice! Delicious meal every visit here. I got my stamp card updated and now my next meal here is FREE!   Eliana is a very nice server and very attentive.  The service here is always 5 stars! Can't wait to come back and try some other lunch specials."}
{"text":"This place was recently taken over by a Brazilian family. Definitely try ANYTHING from the Brazilian part of the menu. The pizzas are good too. Really good food and decent prices. They are still trying to get the hang of serving because their main focus seems to be to-go orders. I am usually there at least once a week."}
{"text":"Amazing! Have basically all the food that Brazilian people like and in a fair price. Awsome stuff!"}
{"text":"Being Brazilian I think I can give an accurate review about the food. It is the real deal.. It's Brazilian Comfort food!! Do not expect to find the food you would eat at Texas do Brazil, because there you will find food adapted to the American culture.  The food was delicious and maybe it was luck, but the girl who served me was really polite and my order was taken straight away and the food came fast!  I found interesting to see reviews saying that they went to try Brazilian food and ordered the lamb gyros.. (btw it is greek). I will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"I love the food here! There pastels and coxhinas remind me of home!! Good place to try out!---- !!!!!!!!! sadly this has changed! It's been two times that I've found hair in the food! Never going back! Last time i did post mates 35$ of food called restaurant told me nothing they could do called Postmates, they told me restaurant would refund! Sorry but i had to throw all of it away! Sucks i really liked it here, but after two times finding hair, I won't ever go back! Hair is disgusting!"}
{"text":"I usually don't do any reviews, but for Boca do Brasil i will have to write a quick review! First of all, the Brazilian guy who served us...AMAZING. If i had my business i would have to have this guys running my restaurant, he is really polite, nice, friendly, caring....very very good, congratulations!! The food was delicious, very very good, with awesome flavor....everything was super good and i will be back to try EVERYTHING ELSE!"}
{"text":"if you are expecting a fancy Brazilian steakhouse, this isn't  the place for you. However, if you are looking for something reasonably priced and authentic, come here! When I went to Brazil, I fell in love with their food. Therefore, I was happy to stumble upon Boca do Brasil. I felt like i was back in Brazil when I came here.     When you eat here, I recommend that you try the following foods: coxinhas, pasteis, feijoada, picanha(top sirloin), pizza com frango e catupiri, and açaí na tigela. Do you not want to leave the house? No problem, they deliver. Enjoy,"}
{"text":"I have been here a hand full of times.  The consistency from each visit has been incredibly perfect.  Their burgers are very filling, my boyfriend wanted to try the $9 X-Tudo burger with lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, bacon, ham,  burger and cheese.   We both ordered the same thing.  I was so full when we left I was thinking to myself how we probably could of split a burger and fries.  He finished his but I had to skip the bread towards the end.  Customer service here is a rated highly.  While we were eating a person ordered 5 extra large pizzas I assume for catering pick up.  Those pizzas smelled fantastic. They have a lunch special from 11-4PM for $8 also.  I have not tried tried their lunch special yet."}
{"text":"Boca do Brasil é o verdadeiro restaurante brasileiro em las Vegas!.  This is a really authentic Brazilian restaurant in Las Vegas, so if you are looking for a cheap, good, authentic brazilian restaurant and all you can find are those gigantic and expansive stake houses, now you found your place. Boca do Brasil has authentic street food, that kind of food you can find anywhere, from padarias to small bars downtown Copacabana and in the center of Sao Paulo.  Boca do Brasil have brazilian salgadinhos, Guaraná Antartica, homemade catupiry, sandwiches,  pasteis, and a beautiful, comfortable, yet small environment :)  The service is great and they speak good English,  Portuguese and Spanish! Their waitress is super funny and she learned Portuguese while working over there. The owner is always there and their food is super fresh!!! You won't regret,  but remember that this is a very affordable place so don't rate it down just because it's not like \"Fogo de Chao\" and other super high end expensive brazilian stake houses in Vegas. This is not a steak house! This is a contemporary brazilian restaurant that serves authentic and fresh Brazilian foood.  They usually have Brazilians eating there so you know it's authentic and good! Their tv always plays brazilian channels and they always give you free \"Cachaça\" shots when Brazil scores during the soccer games."}
{"text":"Oh man, I had high hopes for this place. We had two waitresses. The first one was very friendly. The second one was nice but a bit dry. :o/ Sorry waitress, but you need to be more upbeat!! Especially if you want to wake this girl up to eat at your establishment. We came around 11am. We were the only ones there but people started to trickle in for take out.   Wish I took a menu so I could remember the names of our dishes. :o/  Our order:  Coxitan: Tasted like a deep fried breaded mashed potato ball with chicken. Pretty good. The potato inside was warm but the chicken was just room temperature.  #8 Steak and Eggs: So disappointed with this dish. The egg looked overcooked and dry and the steak was UNSEASONED! Come on guys, just a bit of salt will do the trick. #9 Steak with potatoes: A bit better, but it really didn't even look the dish on the menu. It was just one potato, not even cut. Still good, but eh.  #Gyro: I was expected nicely sliced lamb or beef. But it tasted like sausage? Breakfast sausage? Still I enjoyed this dish. The pita bread was nice and soft. #X-Americano: Ham, egg, cheese sandwich (on a hamburger bun). Nothing special but I liked this better than the gyro.  And well, that was it. That was my experience there."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Brazilian food. Everyone was super friendly specially Hector. The have a little market inside with Brazilian candies and goodies. Passion fruit juice is a must try."}
{"text":"I think part of the reason for sone of the negative reviews are because people are expecting this restaurant to be on the same level as Texas de Brazil.   Many people think Brazilian food is just what they eat at these expensive restaurants, without ever eating what people in Brazil eat every day. Unfortunately I think this affects their reviews.  I lived in Brazil for a few years, and since returning to the US I have missed eating what I ate in peiples hones every day. The coxinhas, beans, rice, meats, salads, and even pasta dishes that I craved butbcould never find here in Vegas.   Someone told me about Boca de Brazil and I knew I had to visit. Im glad I did. Everything on the menu I have tried is absolutely amazing.  The Coxinhas in particular are made the same way they are in Brazil, and are huge. My in laws from Europe had their pizza during a visit and they told me it was the best pizza they have had in the US.   I have always had superb customer service and the family that owns it are Brazilian. The mother recognizes me now when I come in and alwayd makes it a point to poke her head out of the kitchen to tell me hello.   I woukd recommend any of their dinner and lunch plates, as well as their coxinhas and pastels.  Again, try the pizza, especially with chicken and catipuri cheese, you won't regret it.   I hear they are contemplating another location. If it is on the east side of town I am going to get into some trouble!"}
{"text":"They have passed out fliers in the past by the business around here and we had one sitting on our kitchen counter for a while.  So we finally decided to go.    The reason why I didn't go before was I had a bad experience here during my pre-yelp life.  But you know me - always willing to give it another whirl.  Especially since a lot of time had passed and they were touting new owners/management.  OK - so we get there and I see that not much had changed there.  They still had canned drinks only.  No drink fountain.  No fear, I did drink a lot of water that morning.  The single can of soda made me feel sad.  I would have rather had water.  It took a while for us to be \"waited\" on. Huh-huh-huh... No, not funny.   We were the ones doing the waiting.   When we finally got to order, we opted for the the $5.00 Gyro special.  It took a very long time for the food to come.  When it finally came I immediately started eating. Not bad.  I am a sucker for gyro's and fries.    Unfortunately, service is part of the equation when I rate a business.  This place had close to no service.  I also felt ripped off because of the \"waiter\" service, I am obligated as a decent human being to live a tip.   If this place would invest in a real drink fountain, some more focus on SERVICE and allow people to order at the counter and pick their food up at the counter a-la fast food style, then I think it would be a winner.  They also tout a Brazilian menu items here and it did seem to bring a lot of business for their Brazilian food while we were there. Waiting. Watching. Waiting...  I so hoped it would be a winner too because I need a good gyro supply by my work place."}
{"text":"Omg! I'm so happy I came across this hidden gem. This pita has everything a girl could ask for! It had so much flavor and every bite it got better and better! I also got the pao queijo... which is obviously the cheese balls from Brazilian gods! I could eat a million of them! I'll 100% be back, I have to try so much more on the menu!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but, the portions are tiny. We did do take-out so maybe that was the problem."}
{"text":"I was recommended this restaurant by a medical student whose wife is Brazilian. It's a bit far west, but I decided to check it out for lunch one day.   The place isn't big, but has some seating for dining in. The servers are all very friendly, and all of the employees are Brazilian, and I heard them converse with some customers in Portuguese.   I enjoyed my food thoroughly, see attached photos. Prices were moderate and portions were decent. The menu isn't too big.  Honestly, I don't think there are that many Brazilian places in town, so this one is a solid offering!"}
{"text":"Good gyro deal. The new ownership and staff is EXTREMELY rude and uncooperative. I called to ask if they had any pizza/wing specials and I was told to go to their website, a website that DOESN'T EXIST! It's unfortunate that the old ownership is gone, I liked them...."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place, walked in and nobody was in the front to take my order, took them at least 5 minutes to come out, although the guy was nice & helpful.. Prices are reasonable but the food didn't taste so great.. Ordered the lamb gyro and the meat almost didn't even taste like real meat tasted & looked very cheap.."}
{"text":"Boca do Brasil it  is a great  restaurant servers great brasilian food it is authentic. I would recommend the coxinha it is delicious,the boiling meat with potatoes,carrots,beans,rice and fries;the chicken pizza with catupiry cheese and the feijoada serve as a special Saturday's .I always have a great experience as a customer \"Mom\" Angela  is always there plus they have a great waiter Heitor,very nice guy from Brasil.You should try very affordable price!"}
{"text":"good service. food is good. very small restaurant.  A lot of Brazilians hang out at this restaurant.  It gets loud when they start to speak in native tongue. Tables  are very close to each other. I think they only have 6 tables. Anyways, it is like mom and pop hole in the wall restaurant. Very inexpensive  to eat and good. I will be back."}
{"text":"Online ordering was fast and simple.  Order was ready within 30 min!  All my food was great, loving the pizza pocket thing!  (Forgot the name)  Service was short and sweet, just how I like it!"}
{"text":"First time coming to Boca and I will be back! The food was delicious and staff is very attentive not to mention friendly."}
{"text":"When we go to Vegas, we make sure to come at least once to Boca, it surely has authentic Brazilian food! Service sometimes might be a bit slow but we noticed a big improvement over the times we have come, besides it's all fresh food made to order, so it's all good and worth the wait.  Plate portion sizes are great, I can easily split with hubby but we usually order 2 to take leftovers, yummy! The salgados (pastries) are soooo good, it's making me hungry just thinking about them. We usually order their delicious pasteis, cheese, chicken and cheese and doce de leite and the coxinha which is amazing. As for plates, we love the picanha, and the chicken parmigiana plates. Pizzas are awesome, especially the authentic chicken and catupiry cheese, and margherita pizza!  Never tried the feijoada but my mom says it's very well made, and she's a Brazilian cuisine expert! Give Boca do Brasil a try and you won't regret it! I only wish we lived closer!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! You have to try the coxinha, a deep fried dough filled with shredded chicken.  The yucca fries (mandioca frita) are so awesome, you can't just have one.  Saturdays is when they serve the Brazilian national dish, Feijoada, which is a black bean stew with meats served with rice and collard greens.  The cheese bread is another must.  The beef stroganoff was just like my mama's! Best of all, the food is moderately priced.  The staff was super attentive and nice. Will definitely have to go back and visit again!"}
{"text":"I LOVED this place. I haven't ate a GOOD traditional brazilian food in years. Heitor was our waiter he's amazing!!! The coxinha was heaven, the pastel de vento actually was filled with so much meat. Whoever go to visit Las Vegas has to go to this place. In my opinion the only problem was that the place was too small. But besides that everything was amazing."}
{"text":"The coxinha was amazing here!! The picanha was not bad although the portion size could have been more generous. The pastel was ok, not the best. The staff was very pleasant and friendly. The food did take a while to come out but I would say it was worth it. We ended up eating here two days in a row. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Was craving a gyro but didn't want to go too far out of my way. I was skeptical about gyros from a Brazilian place but I was pleasantly surprised. The meat wasn't the typical shaved off the spit kind. It was more like elongated thin meat patties that tasted like regular gyro meat but they were juicer and less salty. I would definitely get them again."}
{"text":"The picanha is amazing! Good and quick service. Great spot for some quick and authentic Brazilian cuisine."}
{"text":"The best Brazilian food in Vegas. Family owned and run. Family recipes. Just like mama makes!!!!  And shes the one in the kitchen.  Heard about it all the way from CA. A must stop when in town!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I split the Beirut sandwich which was plenty for both of us. the small restaurant was charming and the staff was very friendly Definitely will go back for the sandwich and will try the weekend special."}
{"text":"Love the food, real authentic Brazilian! Ask for the lunch special is awesome.  Fantastic service."}
{"text":"***VEGAN OPTION: rice, beans, sautéed collard greens, farofa, fried banana, fried yucca. AMAZING!!!  Opção vegano: arroz, feijão, couve, farofa, banana, mandioca frita. DELICIOSO!!!  Minus one star bc I almost passed out from the heat inside the restaurant. Was a really hot day but felt hotter inside the restaurant. I was light-headed about 5 times.   Also, don't be in a hurry to eat - they are laid back at this place!   Very nice guy that was serving the day we were there."}
{"text":"Love this place. Beirute is my children's fave. Coxinha, kibe and pastel are must for me. The place is super clean."}
{"text":"I've been once before a while back and was amazed by the coxinha. so I went back today and ordered that, the pastel with the sausage, and the lamb gyro. I have to say that the first bite of coxinha was awesome then it just went downhill. it wasn't as good as I remembered or wanted to remember. the best out the things I ordered was the gyro. altho I have to question if it was REAL lamb that I ate. it seemed like a hybrid mystery meat. the pastel, I don't even know what that's supposed to be but it seemed like giant fried flour with canned sausage meat and mayo inside it. couple bites and I couldn't even eat it.  I don't think I'll ever come here again. if you are in the mood for some Brazilian food then start with the coxinha since it's their popular item."}
{"text":"I had a nice visit here with a big group, and was able to try several items. We ordered two different pizzas, which were good. Some other fried items were ordered, in addition to Picanha steak dish.   I think someone also ordered the stew dish, which I got to try. I've gotta say, the best item for me were the fried plantains. Yeah, i kinda originally was thinking MEH, not a huge fan of plantains, but, it was REALLY good that we ordered one more.   I thought the Picannha steak was well seasoned, and I'd rather go to a different place to get a dish like this, but it is a good dish to hold you over if you don't want to deal with the buffets. The bean dish and the stew type thing wasn't as good as when I had it in Brazil...and the beans were overly salty for my taste.   The waiter was awesome, and he was such a delight!"}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER PIZZA FROM THIS PLACE. I made a mistake to order an extra large pizza for my family to watch the games when I went to pick up I noticed my pizza was folded in half and all the cheese was everywhere in the box instead of my pizza. I said I did not order a calzone she told me that they did not have a larger box so they folded the pizza. I asked for the manager and the Armenian girl told me that they do not have managers and I had to take the pizza as is. This is not the first time she was rude with me and my friends. Before we order food in this place and the Armenian girl was rude with us. Service is bad and the food sucks."}
{"text":"The coxinhas are so good! I've ordered takeout from here several times. Friendly staff, super fast, and delicious."}
{"text":"Love the food!!!!! The pizza is the best in town!!!!!! Great customer service!!!!! Clean , cozy,  and fast service."}
{"text":"Comida maravilhosa! Atendimento perfeito. Comemos coxinha de Galinha com catupiry  e pastel de Carne. Sem defeitos!  Estávamos viajando de férias e encontramos  esse restaurante próximo a Vegas.  Nota 10"}
{"text":"I am not one to typically yelp, but I couldn't let this place not get the recognition it deserves. First of all, upon entering there's a super authentic feel, and the lady was so warm and welcoming. She answered all our questions and we (my coworker and I) decided to go with the #7 lunch special... it was so incredibly delicious and such a great value! The meat was so juicy and tender, and the rice was delicious! We will definitely be  back."}
{"text":"My favorite Brazilian restaurant here!! I'm Brazilian and since moving here I've tried a few places out but this one place is just perfection. They have everything a restaurant needs to have to be good, AMAZING food, a nice and cozy space and really friendly staff. You will feel home! So they have many options for appetizers, main meals, pizzas and deserts (and they have Guaraná!). It's a must try if you want to try Brazilian food or if you're looking for a new restaurant!  We come here often for the sausage with onions (comes with white rice, beans, fries and a salad). You can also add fried eggs for really cheap. And for their brigadeiros! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This little place is in a strip mall, but such a yummy hole in the wall spot for Brasilian food!   We went on a Saturday and had the feijoada special.  I recommend going a bit earlier in the day if you get this, otherwise you get the end of day batch that was just a bit over salted for our liking.    The coxinha are big and delicious. The stroganoff was my favorite and came out very fresh!    Our server was awesome! He was the only one working and extremely attentive to our needs!"}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Brazil. Every time my wife and I vacation in Las Vegas, we eat at this place, we try to support local businesses as much as possible. This restaurant used to be good .There are two waitresses, one is very nice, but the one who is always at the register could work on her people skills, too dry. I ordered 2 beef parmegianas+2 pastels+2 cans of guarana=41$, pricey. The meat was terrible. Both steaks had a huge piece of nerve right on the center, taking up 50% of the steak. The nerve was as hard as bone. The 2 cans of guarana were 3 bucks each. When the lady took them out of the fridge, they were still warm so I asked for a refund and she refused saying \"you got to understand, we barely put the cans in the fridge, and it's just $6, take something else instead! \" so I ended up taking 6 cans of coke. Although the pastels were good, this place is a joke! I'm never going back! check out 3 photos of the huge nerves."}
{"text":"Every time we are here in Vegas we love to stop by and eat at Boca Do Brasil. The staff actually remember us considering we are only there about once or twice a year. Super friendly, super delicious food!"}
{"text":"So delicious!! We needed something like this is Vegas. I love Brazilian food and this is the perfect little restaurant to get just what you want!! I'm from jersey so we had so many little Brazilian Peruvian Colombian restaurants and I think it's not as common to find here so when you do, it's always amazing. So happy to have found this place! And live super close. Definitely love it. PLUS they have a lunch time special for plates that are only 7.99$ and comes with fries salad rice and beans and meat or chicken how can you beat a deal like that!!!"}
{"text":"Kinda hard to find.   This place is a gem next to all its commercial neighbors.    Off of Fort Apache and Trop, right behind KFC, Taco Bell, and the neighborhood Roberto's.     This place has a Brazilian pizza menu that delivers but I never once tried it.     I come here for their traditional plates.     Always delicious and filling.  Rice, beans, salad.   All very distinctly subtle with Brazilian spices.     Portuguese speaking in the background.   Always full of Brazilian ppl.    Nice get-away until I make it back to South America."}
{"text":"Probably the Best food in Vegas for the money. So unique! So tasty. Never had anything here that I don't like"}
{"text":"authentic brazilian food, excellent quality and super tasty! great service, food arrived quickly and server was super courteous."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD, AMAZING PEOPLE! Love this place :) come here all the time! Try the pao de queso, acai bowl, cochina, or their portuguese PIZZZZAAaaaaaa! Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"I ordered a gyro sandwich. It was good. I'm surprised they don't offer falaffel here though."}
{"text":"The decor needs some work, but the food and service is exceptional.  I wouldn't walk in there if I was some of my friends because it looks a little...low quality.  Don't be fooled, the food is fantastic!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fast service, nice and clean place to eat. Gyro is the so good with some rice. Salad are French comes with my gyro plates.  Will be coming back here for sure."}
{"text":"Best Brazilian food in Las Vegas. Family like environment and very nice Service. Heitor did a great job serving us with happiness and efficiency."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place doesn't have a better review. Everyone always treat me very good and the food is very yummy. It reminds me of my mom's cooking back in Brazil. The owner is super sweet. She always comes out to say hi. If you are looking for a Mom and Pap restaurant this is the place to go ;)"}
{"text":"Being to this restaurant couple times during the World Cup 2014 Brazil. Very friendly people with good people. I would go back."}
{"text":"My second time visiting this place and sure did love the hospitality and delicious food!! Would come back again"}
{"text":"UPDATE: Their cooks seem to have changed. The stroganoff is now lacking a creaminess that Brazilian stroganoff has. The flavors are just not there anymore. We tried the place 4 Times again before I changed my review. What a shame, service is always very very nice though.  **********************************************************  I really don't understand why this place has bad reviews, their brasilian food is really good, after all, the name of the restaurant is boca do BRASIL!! They serve picanha which is a brasilian meat cut that is out of this world, if you want to eat this meat youll have to pay $50+ and go to a brazilian steakhouse. Here they have it well cooked, well seasoned for about 13 or 14 bucks. They have strogonoff which i really loveeeeee, they are sweet people, trying to run a business. Stop making it hard for them and stop giving bad reviews because they only have canned drinks. really??!!! oh and by the way, you have to wait for the food because THEY ARE MAKING IT FRESH. Their food really is delicious."}
{"text":"I love their pizza!  I keep meaning to try the rest of the menu but I am so in love with their pizza that I just never get around to it.  It's definitely more of a carry out type eatery than a sit down and eat restaurant, but I just can't get enough of it.  The lady behind the counter who usually takes my order is also very friendly."}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall place with some very tasty feijoada for $16.95 a plate. When we first walked in, we thought it was a to-go restaurant as it has a tiny convenience store area.   Place definitely is not a place where you need to dress up at all. It's very small, and could fit maybe 15 people inside. Obviously, this is not a Brazilian steakhouse, so don't worry about needing to shell out $50+ a person on dinner. Per person, with a drink, tax and tip, you're looking at about $25. I think that's a little steep for the atmosphere and location, but what can you do?  They also serve American hamburgers if the person you're with is too picky to try Brazilian food, but don't bother bringing a picky eater. The feijoada is one of the better ones I've had, but the picanha is way overcooked. Make sure to order it medium rare, as the default way of cooking it is well done.   If I didn't want to go to a Brazilian steakhouse but was in the mood for a quick Brazilian dish, this place would fit the bill."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly owners, they carry authentic brazilian dishes. After taking clients to Brazil on www.TripsToJohnOfGod.com I love bringing the group to Boca do Brasil for an amazing meal."}
{"text":"Nice service, very attentive. We had the feijoada and pastel de palmito and it was all very good!"}
{"text":"Food is good, service is always with a smile, and the good thing that is close AND clean! When you don't want a full rodizio, just a plate, or just an appetizer (coxinha, pastel...) this is the place."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Omg the flavors that they put together are just so mouth watering! Great food and great service here! Every single employee here is so nice and smiles and you just get that vibe of welcome! Will be a regular from here in out!"}
{"text":"My co-worker brought me food from this place for lunch today. It wasn't very good. He said the service wasn't very good either. I got a steak and eggs meal. The steak was really really tough. The marinade or  seasoning was not good but it was edible. The rice sucked - really mushy. The beans were not good at all. The eggs were not bad. The 2 stars go just for the french fries!! They were great!! They remind me of NJ diner fries :)  I don't recommend going here. It's kind of disappointing bc  they have all these pics of UFC stars (vitor belfort and gsp) eating there, saying that they loved the food. Blahh."}
{"text":"Picanha, rice, French fries &salad. They forgot the beans but I just saw it when I got home. I was super interested on the beans. Besides that. It's delicious."}
{"text":"OMG i was in brazil for a month and fell in love with brazilian food..  I was referred to this place and i was so excited and not disappointed in the food and service..   I got the COXINHA absolutely delicious.. and the Linguica Acebolada which is smoked sausage and grilled onions with rice and beans and fries..  Defiantely worth eating here if you love Brazilian food!!!!"}
{"text":"Comida deliciosa!!! Lembrou a comida da minha mae e eu me senti no Brasil de novo! Os pasteis são uma delicia e o strogonoff é ótimo também! De 5 dias que estive em Vegas, comi la com meu namorado e a familia dele (todos americanos) 4 dias, porque eles ficaram apaixonados com a comida!!"}
