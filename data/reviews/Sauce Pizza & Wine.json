{"text":"I really appreciate that there's a Sauce at the airport. It's a better alternative to the other pizza places that are a bit blah. It's a good place to have lunch. Food is always yummy and comes out in a timely manner, which is always appreciated since I have a limited lunch break. I've eaten my way through most of the menu, but haven't gotten around to the breakfast just yet. I did see that they have a breakfast pizza which piques my interest so I'll have to give that a try sometime."}
{"text":"Can't really say anything bad about this place, but it did not knock me off my feet. I went to use a Veebow discount at a restaurant next door, but saw that this was a lil more kid friendly so we stopped in. 
Pros: Pizza was really good, not great, but really good. Salads was good as well, the food was not bad at all. They had a mac and chees for my son which I caught my wife enjoying as well.
All in all, we are going to help promote this business, because of friendly mgr and staff. They will keep seeing us there over and over.

This place is Good."}
{"text":"I don't understand the attraction to this place. My daughter loves it but she's 11. I keep trying different things in the hope of discovering something edible. Last night I tried pasta and meatballs. The pasta was rubbery. Sauce and meatballs were Way too salty. I ended up asking for a 2nd dinner roll because that was the only edible thing. On the positive side, all of the staff are very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, 2 pizzas 2 pastas,  one pizza was cooked the other was not, the crust was completely white and flimsy, and I am pretty sure the \"fresh mozzarella\" that I paid extra for was not any different than the regular.  I had to put it in my oven to finish.  The menu says the build your own pizza price includes one topping, but the drill down menu charged extra for any more toppings than cheese.  The broccoli chicken and cheese sauce came with 3 florets of broccoli.  The only good thing was plain Mac n cheese."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times for lunch. The pizza selections are good. Had the Arugula with Truffles pizza, which was really good the first time, but another time I did not get the truffle flavor (guess they ran out of the truffle oil). The chicken with pine nuts and gorgonzola cheese salad is a must-have."}
{"text":"The person taking our order was very sullen and rude - we asked the manager to complete our order! We like the food at Sauce, but if she is serving we will go elsewhere next time. I hope the management takes note."}
{"text":"Sam Fox - Do we know each other?  Then how do you know me so well?  

Every time Fox opens a restaurant we feel like he had me and my wife in mind.  Good food with rich ingredients.  Clean, modern, casual dining experience.  And Sauce is fast and serves up some great salads and pizza.  

Personally I like to keep it simple with the Mozzarella & Fontina Cheese & Basil pizza.  I will occasionally ask for tomatoes on top and always top it off with the crushed red peppers.  My wife loves the caesar salad and I can understand why.  Their dressing is brilliantly balanced and add on the fresh cheese flecks and it is simple, but great.  I have had other salads and they are all good and as others have stated, the mac and cheese is very good.

I just love the simplicity of walking in and ordering and being able to sit and enjoy a casual and quick dining experience with good food at a great price.  Thank you Sam Fox.... but I still swear we know each other."}
{"text":"I stopped by Sauce the other night in a search for a new pizza place. Sauce is a great choice for pizza. Fresh ingredients and cooked perfectly.   The service time frame is just right and the atmosphere is inviting and relaxing. The staff are friendly and I received superb service from a young lady, I believe her name was Lauren...personable, great smile and came to the table to ensure I was happy with my order and asked if I had everything I needed. As I was leaving, she thanked me for for coming in and once again hoped I had enjoyed my meal. It is rare to experience great service such as this at most establishments. I will be dining there again!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food. Vegetarian options were fresh and flavorful. Bread hot and delicious. Will eat here again."}
{"text":"We come to this location at least twice a week. We love the fresh food and quick service. Never been disappointed. Don't eat the cookies unless you want to be hooked!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! The turkey feta salad is delicious and there's something about the roll that comes with it that has me hooked!"}
{"text":"The roasted veggie salad was great!  Pizzas are always tasty here as well.

Quick, good food!"}
{"text":"Pizza was burnt and clearly warmed up with some more cheese thrown on top.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"I came in yesterday around 6:30 I got a meatball panini and it was amazing, the thing that made my experience even better was the quality of service I received from everyone there especially the cashier, Lynn? He was so energetic and nice he definitely made me feel welcome. Keep up the great work guys!!! 11/10"}
{"text":"I can't believe this is an airport restaurant. Caprese bruschetta and Tuscan tomato soup are outstanding.  Prices are no worse than a restaurant in town.  Only drawback is the airport noise but they can't fix that... highly recommend"}
{"text":"We have stopped at Sauce a couple times now to either dine-in or take out a pizza.  The summer special (pizza, salad, 2 drinks) is a great deal.  I'm a fan of the thin crust. It has a great texture, and I like that it is not crispy.  I find that I like the red sauce pizzas better, and they seem to be a little less oily.  The dining experience is casual but great, and the take out is very prompt."}
{"text":"Maybe the mistake to think this would have been a good lunch. The food is subpar at best. The prices are affordable but the pizza is below average. Too many good choices in Phoenix to spend money here."}
{"text":"Never agin..it was our first time trying Sauces. We went up to the order desk (okay cool) and told the girl we've never been and asked about the menu, she was NO help what so ever. I understand its close and convenient for people but we went there this afternoon and my husband and I split a Caesar and a Pepperoni and Mushroom pizza. The Caesar had such a unusual tart taste (bitter) and I asked my husband who is a Chef (not community college degree, but has been to LeCordon Bleu and is a Scottsdale Chef) what's up with the flavor and he said its horrid its overwhelmed in garlic. Then our pizza came out. It was unbelievably greasy, and it was soggy. I would much rather go to Grimaldis for their lunch special than go back to Sauces.  Sorry Sauces major thumbs down..."}
{"text":"Typically, I've enjoyed this restaurant.  However, DO NOT order anything to go.  I picked up two turkey and feta salads to take back to the office for myself and my BFF, and nicely hidden underneath a mound of feta and turkey cubes is the slimiest, grossest salad greens . . . totally disgusted.  Will NOT be returning for more of this."}
{"text":"Giant waste of money. 

Ordered the pepperoni & mushroom on thin crust. It was so greasy the slice wasn't even possible to hold, completely fell apart. I took one bite and pushed it aside refusing to consume that much grease. Walked out of there hungry..and pissed. Never again! 

Grimaldis is the way to go. Never disappointed with the quality there."}
{"text":"Great veggie salad!  Awesome customer service!  Good Pinot Grigio!  Unexpectedly fresh and delicious food at the airport!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place as much as I love chipotle but lately I've been super disappointed. The main reason I love sauce is because of the orecchiette noodles. I work 17 minutes away so I had my boyfriend call in the order to pick up, they said 15 minutes it would be ready. I got there 20 minutes later and waited another 15 for my food and came home and wasn't even the right noodles. Don't know if they changed the noodles or ran out but it wasn't the same eating with macaroni noodles."}
{"text":"So so sad. Quality has gone down since they started expanding.  

When I first started eating at Sauce, it was great food. The last two times I've gone in, the roasted veggie salad was pretty much raw. They used to cook and toss the Brussel sprouts and cauliflower for the salad. 

Service last time took forever to get pizza. Seemed more concerned about getting to go orders out the door.  Used to be a go to when we wanted to eat out but not so much anymore. 

Too bad."}
{"text":"Been here 2 times and ordered the following:

Chicken pesto pizza
Chicken broccoli pasta
Lasagna ( came with a side of bread and butter!)
..the pepperoni and sausage pizza with mushrooms on top (I forgot the exact name/combo)

+1 Restaurant cleanliness, comfort & ambiance. I really like the interior layout of this location. 
+1 Fast service
+1 Good portions for both the pastas and pizzas
+1 Chicken broccoli pasta, lasagna, and the extra bread on the side! 
+1 For the pizzas. Delicious. Fresh ingredients. 

-1 Cashier was rude when we had a miscommunication about our order, but it got resolved quickly by the manager ( I think that's who she was?). 

Overall I think it's a great place with great food. It's not OMG WOW but it's definitely somewhere I'd recommend people to go to + I  can't wait to come back to try their paninis and salads!"}
{"text":"We frequent this place at least once month.  Food is excellent and the service is speedy.  Restaurant is clean. We really like it!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch with a friend today I was pleasantly surprised by the very open and clean looking atmosphere. She recommended the Mac and cheese bowl so I ordered it with some sausage as well. Good arrived pretty quickly and looked amazing! Tasted even better! One of the better Mac n cheese dishes I've had and was surprised by the roll with butter handed to me along with it. Very pleased with the customer service food and prices I will be back!!"}
{"text":"They have amazing pizza and I love the laid back vibe. It's probably my favorite pizza ever (and I've had a lot of pizza). Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The chicken cesar pizza was fresh and the crust was soft and crunchy.. Light but feeling."}
{"text":"I've visited this location in the past and it was great. Needed to have delivery via Grub Hub this time...pizza is cold and order isn't complete. I don't know if it's a Grub Hub or Sauce issue but I won't do that again! Disappointed!"}
{"text":"Wife and I decided to try Sauce tonight. Right down the street and Gluten Free pizza for Tracy. 
After ordering the manager, Daniel came out to inform us that the cashier had made a mistake, they did not have pineapple to go with our ham and peppers. 
 Daniel saw that we would be fine, but the pineapple would have been great. 

Little did we know Daniel tore off to Albertsons so his customers would have what they came for. 

Great service. Thanks Daniel. We had a great evening, both food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love sauce! I came here after receiving one of there gift cards for Christmas. My boyfriend and I had the build your own pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and roasted peppers with mozzarella cheese and hand tossed. I must say it was DELICIOUS! The crust was mouth watering, we also had the turkey and feta salad that also was delightful. We came again we just couldn't resist. the second time we had the chicken Caesar salad pizza  that was good but I liked the crust on the build your own pizza better then the crust of the chicken Caesar salad pizza. We also order spaghetti and meat balls, the meat balls  we're delicious but I'm not Likely to order that again.  I had a wonderful time on both visits and I will be returning. The only reason I did not give five stars is because the cashiers seemed careless and in no hurry to help a customer. I ordered a glass of wine and the cashier said she would bring it over yet ten minutes later I still didn't receive it. Untill I got up and waited by the registers and then I reminded the cashier about the glass. Then I Finally received the glass of wine. Over all I had a great experience and I will be recommending this restaurant to all my friends and family. :)"}
{"text":"It's great to come into an airport and get a healthy, tasty, and reasonably-priced meal. Had the chicken, pine nut, tomato and Gorgonzola salad--yum!"}
{"text":"This place is okay, BUT I would hesitate to call it a Pizza place. Maybe if it was specified as flatsbread style pizza than it would get four stars, but when you want pizza and you go to a place that puts toppings  on a cracker it leaves you saying WTF??? Okay so the toppings are awesome, like truffled mushrooms with arugala, very healthy too. My only beef is it is not like a traditional pizza, or even a thin crust, it's a dang cracker. The salads were good too and the service is awesome. All in all three stars, unless you like pizza crackers than bump it up to your liking."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with our last visit.  One of the items that my husband loved has been removed from the menu - the caprese bruschetta.  And my absolute favorite pizza is not the same - the sausage and caramelized onion pizza used to be fabulous; but, it is not anymore.  There was hardly any onions on it and the sausage has been changed and not for the better.  I'm not sure what has happened, but with our favorites gone there is little reason to return.  Plus, we waited long for our pizza and it came out burnt.  Salads came out way before the pizza - so everyone was eating at different times.  Long time patron looking for another option..."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here. I had the roasted vegetable salad with a cup of tomato soup. Wowee.....the tomato soup was great! Looking forward to trying other salads here in the future."}
{"text":"Best salads in town for a really good price! Highly recommend this place.  Everything is good, but the chicken pine nut Gorgonzola salad is delicious!  Service is always amazing and fast!"}
{"text":"Totally hit the spot!  If you are connecting you'll have to leave the secured section as it is located in terminal 4 near the shops.  Food was great, much better than typical airport pizza."}
{"text":"If I could give a place zero stars I would. This sauce is never fast with good food.  The pizza toppings are far and in between with tons of bubbles.  when the sauce at the waterfront is 19 miles away and 100% better"}
{"text":"This is a great little place for a quick, healthy bite. The staff is friendly, the food is yummy and the store is clean. We brought our kids here and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"We frequent Sauce a few times a month and love their gluten free and thin crust pizza, as well as their salads.  Its convenient, relatively quick and close to our house, making it a good option for us.  

The one thing we have noticed that is really irritating with Sauce is they are almost \"too\" eager to take away your plates as you finish your meal.  This is a place where you order, get a number and then they deliver your food to you, so not a sit down restaurant with a server.  I will have barely finished putting the fork in my mouth for my last bite of food and here comes the 17 year old kid to ask me if he can take my plate. I'm still chewing my last bit and here he comes.... This always happens!  It's like they are watching from the back and having a contest between the teenagers that work there of who can get to the tables and remove the dishes the fastest.  While it's nice they want to remove the dirty dishes, it becomes annoying because they do this for every dish on your table as you finish, interrupting your meal several times.  They also tend to send the teenage workers around to ask how your meal is tasting a bit too much, as well.  I told 4 people the food tasted \"fine\", \"great\", \"very delicious\" the other evening when we were there.  It's making me want to get the food to go ALWAYS.  Hey, wait a minute!  Maybe that's Sauce's strategy all along and it finally worked with us.  Hmmm."}
{"text":"Service with a smile, great pizza, great sauce, and comfortable space to kill time."}
{"text":"Getting to the airport early from a recent trip through Phoenix, I was about to go to a chain restaurant for dinner, but at the last minute decided to try something different with Sauce.  I was blown away by the restaurant and wouldn't hesitate to come back the next time I am in Phoenix.  At about $9 for a pizza and $4 for a beer, the prices were not much higher than other restaurants in the airport, and the food certianly tasted better.  As an added bonus, the manager overheard that I was in the military and offered me a free drink.  He also came by to check up on me a few times and offered to let me use his phone when I mentioned mine was broken.  The combination of service and food quality at Sauce is unparallelled in my airport experience and I would highly reccomend trying it to anyone arriving early for their flight."}
{"text":"Yummy spot for a salad, pizza, & bruschetta. We often come for lunch or get takeout for dinner. Friendly, quick service and a very clean restaurant."}
{"text":"I love Sauce but this location can't seem to get dishes out at the same time.  We've been to this location twice and both times I got my order way before my husband.  I was watching other tables and it was the same case with their orders too.  It took 20 minutes for my husband to be delivered his order after I got mine."}
{"text":"Might be a tough pizza critic since we're from Chicago.  Dough was very thin and therefore 'wet' when ingredients were added.  It was okay but I wouldn't be anxious to have it again.  

Salad with shredded chicken, feta, tomatoes, and pine nuts was fantastic.  Served super cold with a light vinegar and oil based dressing."}
{"text":"Food was very good 
Pizza is amazing and salad was very good
Customer service is excellent as they constantly ask you what you need and provide complimentary bread rolld"}
{"text":"This place is soooo good! Best pizza in Gilbert! Everything else is top notch as well"}
{"text":"Awesome.  The meatballs are really good.  Pizza wasn't my favorite but the salads and pastas are great for airport food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in terms of food! The mac & cheese is amazing as well as the bruschetta. My only problem is when you get things to go. The last time I was in I got mac & cheese with meatballs. Usually when you dine in there are 3 meatballs & a ton of pasta. When I got home with my togo order I saw they only put one meatball and about 1/3 of the container was empty. In store I can hardly finish my meal but the togo portion barely filled me up. Definitely not worth the approximate $10 I spent on it. Great for dine in, not so much for takeout."}
{"text":"Wow! What an amazing spot for a well priced, delicious Italian meal. The mac and cheese is truly to die for. The service was quick and friendly and left me mouth wide with a smile, and stomach full with fantastic cuisine. The outside eating area was lovely with the weather and the server was kind enough to check on us a few times. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"If you want to grab a quick pizza while at the airport, this isnt a bad spot to try. They were actually pretty quick, and the pizza was good.

My main grievances are the same at any pizza place though: lack of viable vegetarian options.

\"but you can get a vegetarian pizza...\" well, Im not a fan of a mouth full of onions and peppers, so unless you have real vegetables, you dont have a veggie pizza. \"but you can have a salad\", yeah and if thats the only vegetarian option anyone offers would you be happy with your choices?"}
{"text":"Legitimately the best airport food I've ever had in my life. Nice decor and atmosphere,  power outlets under every seat to charge your laptop. Why can't they all be like this?"}
{"text":"Good thing I I like your food because the service at this location leaves a lot to be desired.  Ignored at the register.  Never have lasagna.  No smiles.  No hellos.  I come here a fair amount and it's gotten worse over time.  Like I said good thing I like your food."}
{"text":"Grandkids brought me here. They love the Mac and cheese. I had a12\" thin crusted  pizza. It was delicious. The you ng help were delightful and attentive. Will come back for sure when back in town."}
{"text":"Always a great meal.  Prices are great. Staff is awesome.  Food is priced good for the airport."}
{"text":"I work very near Sauce, and I love their menu, but I think they need to insert some of their original training and quality control back into their kitchen at this location.  Food quality has become very inconsistent over the last year.  Sometimes soups will have tons of meat and veggies, sometimes they're mostly broth.  Sometimes the veggies on the winter vegetable salad are nicely roasted, sometimes they look like someone microwaved them.  Today I got a salad with perfectly cooked salmon but truly gigantic uncut leaves of lettuce and kale; it was just...odd.  Love you, Sauce, but bring back your corporate kitchen trainers for a while!!"}
{"text":"Who knew airport food could be so good? Two thumbs up for the bruschetta and creamy tomato soup. All this for less than $8.00!"}
{"text":"I had a take out order, they gave me the wrong order. I had to drive back to get the correct order. Moreover, I ordered a pesto pizza and there was no pesto in it at all. When asked the server they said this is how pesto pizza is. I have not had such issues with any other Sauce location, always get the correct order and a proper pesto pizza.
- Unsatisfied customer"}
{"text":"Really good food, great atmosphere and the best Caprese Bruscetta appetizer and tomato soup anywhere!!"}
{"text":"Food is OK but the operations are far less than OK.  The ONLY reason we ordered out was because we had a gift card...otherwise our first experience here a few years ago was going to be our last.  I ordered around 4:30, which you would expect would be just ahead of dinner, but they were inexplicably out of lasagna.  

Anyway, there are too many really good (4 or 5 star) Italian places around to waste your time or money at Sauce.  No wonder Fox Concepts rid itself of this \"concept\"."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times in the past and it is normally very good. Unfortunately tonight was the exception of that and the experience was so bad that I don't think I'll be coming back to sauce. 

The topping on the pizza where burned, and when this was addressed the manager came by and explained this is how they cook it.  Personally I don't even think he looked at the pizza to notice that his staffed burned it.

I understand that everyone has an off day and mistakes happen in a kitchen. However being condescended to ruined my night."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this pizza. Got a pie with sausage and smoked mozzarella. It was delicious. The crust was thin and had just a bit of char, the sauce was not too heavy, the sausage was just a little spicy, and the smoked moz was a treat. 

This will be my first choice for lunch or dinner when I'm travelling out of PHX terminal 4!"}
{"text":"Most frequent travelers know that PHX is one of the very few airports with REAL dining choices!  No, not the typical crappy national chains (with increased prices), but good, local-ish chains!

This particular Sauce location is located outside of security which is great because it doesn't matter which concourse you're departing from, but it does mean you'll be tempting everyone in the security line with the yummy wafting smell of your pizza.

Employees are helpful, friendly, and accommodating.  I was offered a drink, gratis, while I waited for my pizza to cook.

Back in the day, Paradise Bakery was my go-to Terminal 4 grub.  No more- they've been replaced by Sauce!"}
{"text":"Just like their locations around the valley this one has all the usual favorites. Stop to grab a quick bite before you head through security or get it to go, just don't try to bring a beverage with you through TSA!"}
{"text":"I love Sauce, but this location needs some work! We got a to go order and first they were out of large to go cups, then we asked for extra bread which they were also out of. We ordered the pizza on gluten free crust and when we got it home it just tasted off. I think it may have been undercooked. Sounds like I'm not the only one having issues with this location. We used to frequent Scottsdale one, but we have since moved."}
{"text":"This is the only Fox concept that I really like. Good food, consistent, fast.

My only concern is that it's way over priced for what you get and at least at this location, they aren't able to pin a specific demographic. 

I think of Fox's concepts as overpriced lame food for Scottsdale wannabes but wit Sauce at least the taste of the food is decent and the prices are not a rip off (although not inexpensive).

Sauce could be a great alternative for kid's friendly places but for way less money you can take your kids to other similar more appealing places.

I had a brushetta (too salty) and a vegetable salad. I usually order this two items and this was the first time (among plenty) that I was disappointed with the brushetta. 

My daughter had her very fav Mac and Cheese which usually is really good but this time she didn't finished it :( It wasn't as good as usual.

My mom got a pepperoni, mushroom, onion pizza which was pretty good, crunchy and full of flavor. 

All in all Sauce is a good place to grab a bite, but that's all."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise.  Stopped for a quick bite and had the pizza. It is made to order so plan on a short wait.  But it was worth it.   The pizza crust was crisp, the toppings tasty.  The service staff is friendly and if you eat there they will offer you a refill of your sofa."}
{"text":"Legit Pizza at an airport?

Order, sit down and enjoy.  Great salad and pizza, kinda like Pieology in Cali.

We all know standards at airports are low, that this place had the whole package.  Good service, good people and most of all good food."}
{"text":"I love this place. The bruschetta is delicious. The salads are amazing. The cookies are mind blowing! I love it. It's easy and affordable. I will def be back!"}
{"text":"Needed a place to eat and connect to the Internet to work in between flights.

Checked out the other expensive restaurants and decided on Sauce because they have outlets at every seat in the house.

Asked the cashier what the best salad was and she recommended the Chicken, Spinach, Gorgonzola, Apple and Walnut Salad. Also ordered a glass of $5 chardonnay.

Surprised at how DELICIOUS everything was! Lots of chicken on the salad (and other toppings as well), and the dressing was yummy. Also given a dinner roll with butter to enjoy. The wine was good too.

Seriously, I had a wonderful salad and nice glass of wine for the price of a glass of wine at another one of the restaurants at the Phoenix airport.

I will definitely be back! Thank you Sauce."}
{"text":"Ok.  Just to be clear their thin crust is much closer to a cracker crust.  It's not thin like a Neapolitan style.  And topping are about half the amount of what I would expect on a basic pizza.  'Sauce' is a misnomer - far from any sauce in this.  Flavor not bad, but far from what one would expect with 'thin' crust and 'sauce' as your leading products. Meh...."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times and Sauce NEVER disappoints! It is a nice, hip, casual place to grab lunch or dinner. 

My go-to options are the Meatballs & Mozzarella paninis (which come with a side of potato chips) or the Spicy Chicken Sausage & Cheese Sauce pasta (which come with a dinner roll and butter). If you are not a fan of spicy or even a little spice, I do not recommend getting the pasta because it stays true to its name... Spicy! 

Dessert is always a must, right?! Order the triple chocolate chunk cookie! You will NOT be disappointed... trust me! It is probably the best cookie I have ever had. 

5 stars because the staff is always attending to customers whether for dine-in or take-out especially when we come in 30 mins before closing."}
{"text":"What I like: The food of course, location, speed, and service.  
What I don't like: The small, SMALL portion sizes and the cost associated with those portion sizes.  

We visit this place for lunch often, and we all agree that we really like everything about this place except for the portions and cost associated.  We'd visit far more and take our out of town coworkers here if this was fixed.  Well it was a little while ago when they introduced a lunch combo.  As Amy L. pointed out you could get any two of the three following items: soup, salad, or pasta and a drink.  We all tried this, loved it, were full, and finally felt it was at the right price.  

Today we went back and unfortunately we saw they had removed the signs.  I asked the girl at the register and they said they're trying a new combo out which we all pretended didn't exist on the menu.  This is severely limited to a ceasar or garden salad and a sandwich or soup.  Seriously, we're at a place called \"Sauce,\" yet on the lunch combos you can't order pasta?!  We all ordered a stand alone pasta dish and drink.  We left again unfulfilled, frustrated they fixed and then screwed up their problem, and +$11 in the hole.  

I'd easily rate this place 4 stars if they went back the first lunch combo.  If you're a person who eats small portions, you won't mind this place and I'd highly recommend going.  Hopefully someone at corporate will realize their mistake."}
{"text":"I love Sauce in its natural form, and the fact that it is now available @ Sky Harbor Airport just means I'm guaranteed delicious eats when I travel. My favorite item is the vegetable salad, and the summer special is a salad, pizza and two glasses of wine for $20 -- perfect for pre-flight jitters!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here a few times when traveling. The food is great and the service can't be beat. They are fast, friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I love the Chicken pine nut salad and Pizza combo.  Summer special with 2 glasses of wine for 20. you cant beat it!  Fast service and fresh food."}
{"text":"This place is yummy. I like their pizza and salads, super filling and delicious. The people are super friendly. Going there tonight for dinner :)"}
{"text":"Great pizza and salads in the airport and not airport prices!!! They have great service and the staff are always polite and working hard to get your order out!"}
{"text":"This place was so gross! I find it funny that the name is sauce because there was almost no sauce on my child's pasta and on the pizza! The bruschetta tasted like I might as well have eaten a spoonful of salt & it was definitely way overpriced for the crap that was delivered to my home! I would suggest getting a Red Baron pizza because it will be way better than what they call food at sauce. The best thing we tasted from here is the Sierra mist soda. Huge disappointment & waste of money! Giving one star was being generous!!!!"}
{"text":"They're not a fox concept anymore so you can't use your giftcards here. 

I recommend ordering pizzas hand-tossed.

I was a much bigger fan years ago but now there's a lot of fast-casual pizza competition and I don't think it competes very well and it is priced higher than its rivals."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite thing to eat here are their salads - they are always packed with great tasting, high-quality ingredients (and tasty combinations).  They come in good portions, but honestly they are not as filling as other \"salad\" places I've ordered from.  I've tried their pizzas before, but have never found them memorable.  Their bruschetta was OK - again, not amazing.  Maybe I need to venture out and try more pizzas and more dishes...

Their service has always been prompt and friendly - I like how it is walk-up and pay, but you get table-side service afterwards... Pei Wei should do something like this.  They come by often for anything you might need mid-meal: extra bread, extra butter, extra wine (okay, maybe that's just me!).

They have decent wine (in case it's a liquid lunch ;-) ... hey, sometimes you just want to drink you calories) to accompany your panini or salad or pizza.  The seating outdoors is nice and relaxing when it's not over 100deg F!"}
{"text":"This is not my favorite pizza spot, but if you're vegan, you can make it work. You stand in line and give your order before sitting down. I ordered the rosmary potato pizza veganized. It was basically bread with a couple potato chips arranged in a pattern. Not a great option for vegans but if you're there for a family gathering like I was, you can make it work. There were also other pizzas, you can make most of them vegan by just asking for no cheese and the pizza crust I got was vegan. They were very nice about accommodating and helping me figure out what dairy and egg free. Great service and nice staff, just not a lot of great plant based options from what I saw."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. We can't get enough of their tomatoes soup and their chicken Cesar pizza. The atmosphere is very relaxing. If you're in the area I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm usually not one to really leave reviews, but I really feel the need to after having such a great experience with Sauce on Gilbert Rd. To start, the food was amazing and came out pretty quickly despite the lunch rush. We ran into one issue with dessert not coming out (miscommunication with the kitchen) so we had to leave before we could enjoy it. However, the manager was very professional about the situation and made sure we left happy customers. Thank you Travis! We will be back."}
{"text":"Home of my favorite salad in the world.... The TURKEY FETA!!

Also, home of an incredible lunch special. This location is right by my office and is a regular lunch spot for my crew. $10 gets you Pasta, Salad & Drink. I honestly love all of the pastas on the menu and just rotate what I order. They're all fantastic!

My fiance joined me last time and got the bruschetta and it was also divine. Deliciously toasted bread - a very nice touch!!"}
{"text":"I got the Suprema and I liked it, however I wish I knew they had two different types of crust and that their thin crust is THIN, like paper thin. The crust is crispy its so thin. The thicker crust which my sister in law got was chewy and much preferred. I like their Schreiner's sausage, it's not the Italian sausage out of the casing (lumpy sausage as I call it) but the hard sausage cut into pieces which I prefer. 

I thought the Chicken Cesar and Parmesan pizza was hilarious, literally a cesar salad on a pizza crust. 

I got wine, it was old and they switched it out for a freshly opened bottle. Our pizzas took 40 minutes but the manager comped them. The food was good but it wasn't really fast. They are quick to address issues.

Baby related: Wheel chair ramp from the parking lot to the restaurant was great. Roomy enough to wheel a stroller around. They did have high chairs. Inside reminded me of a Chipotle."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant!!! The service has never failed to amaze me, and neither has the food."}
{"text":"I have never expected excellent food in an airport until visiting Sauce at Sky Harbor.  Great selection of salads and pizza.  Pizza crust is wispy thin and crisp like what you would expect in a gourmet restaurant instead of a chain store.  Reasonable prices for an airport location.  Only draw back is it's location in the pre-security area which means you will have to go through security again if you have a connecting flight to catch."}
{"text":"First time at Sauce Jan 2018....and my last time! WTF??? My 5 year old can put a pizza together better than this!  Seriously...see the pictures. There is no way this should have been let out of the kitchen. The hand rolled dough is soft on the bottom and undercooked in the middle. The sauce is supposed to be the secret...but no sauce can save the flavor of this pizza."}
{"text":"I jink every time I've gone here I've ordered the pizza that is buried under a salad. The chicken Cobb pizza? Can't remember the name...

Any case, it is good, but different. Food is overall good. Price is maybe a little high.

In general I'll pick other places before here... but maybe I need to try something other than the salad pizza."}
{"text":"Good food and decently priced. Definitely don't come here if you are hungry. The pasta portion isn't enough to satisfy any hunger. Wouldn't recommend the spicy chicken sausage & cheese sauce pasta... not even sure why it's called that. There was no chicken, nor sausage....just cheese sauce. I was told the paninis are good and they looked better than the pasta. Better for lunch than dinner."}
{"text":"Airport prices! 2 eggs, toast and potatoes. No drink. $7.65! Very average breakfast for an extremely above average price."}
{"text":"Such good service the employees where nice to each other as well to the customers. The gluten free pizza crust was cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, one of THE worst run restaurants I have ever seen.  I avoid this place at all costs while delivering for doordash, however my wife really likes their bruseta and was craving it tonight.  My wife ordered while I found a table for us outside.  The manager and I use that title loosely was at a table appologizing for a wrong order.  Several tables around us were dirty.  We ordered brusheta (to come out first) a Cesar salad, a pizza and grilled cheese.  15 minutes in my wife's salad comes out.  10 minutes later the pizza and the brusheta comes out.  I had orders a pepperoni, sausage and mushroom pizza, I didn't see sausage so my wife took it back in.  The \"manager\" took the highlighter she had in her hand and was going to point out the \"finely ground\" sausage, as she put it.  She was about to touch the pizza with the highlighter until my wife stopped her.  Then my wife had to ask about the grilled cheese we ordered.  It took around 40 minutes for us to get all of our food.  I could understand that if we were in a real restaurant but for a thin crust 10 inch, a cessar salad, brusheta and grilled cheese to take that long means you probably shouldn't work in the food service industry let alone manage.  Next time I will go out of my way to go to a different sauce!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, good prices topped off with affordable prices. Did not have a Hawaian pizza on the menu. Offered to make it for us."}
{"text":"Be careful here if you have a tree nut allergy.  Their menu seems to have changed recently and I noticed that they now have a salad with cashews (plus one with walnuts, which I think has been around a while.)  I've gotten the Vegetable Salad on several occasions without issue, but yesterday I had a reaction to it, so they must reuse the same mixing bowl or tongs for salad prep.  If I go back in the future, I'll have to ask if they can make a note to the kitchen (and if not, I'll not be getting the salad.)

Aside from this, I'd say their food is decent.  A few times I've been here I've split a salad and pizza with a friend, which works out well.  (They'll even split the salad into two bowls when they bring it out.)  The portobello-artichoke pizza is one of my favorites.  On the other hand, yesterday I used my birthday \"free dessert\" coupon for tiramisu and it was OK taste-wise ... but about 50% frozen.  Soooo, I guess I can't recommend that (though maybe I can't judge it too much since it was free?  Meh, oh well.)"}
{"text":"First off the service here is great. Everyone that I interacted with was friendly and courteous and helpful. They always continued watching tables to make sure everyone was doing great. 

Super impressed with the service!  

Food - I got the Chicken Gorgonzola salad with pine nuts - terrific. I also got the spaghetti and meatballs - also very good. I watched all the pizzas come out and they looked delicious. I'll have to try one next time."}
{"text":"I went to get a Caesar salad sometime back. I specifically mentioned to the African American lady who was at the register that I am a vegetarian and yet she sold me a Caesar salad without mentioning that has Avalon in the Caesar dressing and that is only kind of dressing they have for Caesar salad. I wish she was paying attention when I said I am vegetarian not just sell something. She should be given an opportunity to work on her listening skills and should be fired if it doesn't improve. Eating meat is against my beliefs and she clearly ruined that for me"}
{"text":"Delicious!! I eat here more than I would like to admit and it is consistently yummy. The place is usually full for lunch and dinner, but if you catch them during the 2-4pm hours it's perfect!"}
{"text":"The best restaurant in Sky Harbor Airport.  Finally something that HMS Host hasn't destroyed.  The sausage & caramelized onion pizza is the best.  Staff is great and very friendly."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my artichoke portabello pizza and really enjoyed my friend's truffle mushroom pizza! Next time I would order the truffle one. So good."}
{"text":"Yummy salad and great super helpful staff

I got the chicken, pine nuts and tomato salad and it was really tasty.   The staff is friendly, your food is brought to you quickly and they ask if you need anything.  And then they come out and offer to refill your drinks! Awesome 

I travel a lot and I dread airport food but this was actually very nice"}
{"text":"Had the gluten free chicken pesto and pepperoni pizzas! I preferred the pepperoni and my hubs preferred the other. But they were both awesome! Best GF pizza we've had! Will def be back"}
{"text":"I come here with my wife at least 2-3 times per month, it is a win, plain and simple. Good, QUALITY, fresh, modern food, not cheap and commercial junk like you'd see at applebee's or chili's. You can taste the difference here, and it's fresh quality, FOX restaurants are a solid brand, they use good ingredients, they have an effective system, I'm always impressed.

If you work and live by ocotillo, come here for lunch or dinner, you'll be happy."}
{"text":"I really like sauce.  Ordinarily I get the sausage and carmelized onion pizza and it is really delicious.  The crust is slightly unconventional, more like a cracker than pizza dough, and very thin, but I consider that an acceptable nuance of their place.

My wife always gets the wild mushroom and truffled arugula pizza and although you know my perspective on arugula (tastes like fart) she insists it is the cornerstone of her very existence (in her words: \"it's really good.\"  she understates).

However today I went against all that is good and right with the world and ordered a salad.  Turkey, avocado, and feta salad.  The feta was decent, the avocado was delightful, the turkey was lunch meat turkey cubes.  not a compliment.  The dressing was light and i definitely felt like i was doing something good for my body.

My body was surprised.

Anyway, the salad was a 3 out of five.  Decent, not wonderful.  So the waitress came and said that if I liked that dressing, they have a secret salad with the same dressing and all sorts of italian cold meats in it.  Sounds amazing!  

So I asked her what gives with the secret salad.  Well it is an idea on the part of some of the higher ups to encourage ppl to return to the place and order the salad.  I say, just put your best shit on the menu, otherwise I won't come back.

So I was intrigued.  But do I like being engaged in a cunning ruse to make me return?  no!

So I browbeat the poor hapless waitress for a few minutes about whose idea it was and so on, and then told her I'd never return to sauce so long as i live.

But I will, because that salad sounds tasty as hell.  Plus, with their salads they serve a nice little bread roll which is pretty wonderful.  Also they serve wine and beer and who doesn't like that?"}
{"text":"Sauce is always consistently great food for reasonable prices and quick to get in and out.  Their ingredients always seem fresh and high quality.  The staff at this location are always very friendly and quick to make things right if anything goes wrong.  

My favorite dish is the Caprese Salad (get it with chicken)!  The croutons are to die for.  Also the pizzas are awesome.   To start it off the Caprese Bruschetta is tasty.  For desert the Tiramisu is one of the better I've had.

All this for $10/person and in and out of there in 30 minutes.."}
{"text":"Great service and yummy food. Airports don't often provide this level of eatery."}
{"text":"Stuck at the terminal after landing right now. Not many options for fast casual food and a glass of wine. Sauce has both with a great staff to boot. The manager even came and asked how my day was, which is my typical for a airport location. You order before you sit down, but the service for soda refills and to clear the table is fast and friendly. The pizza is good Neapolitan style. I have had better but never at an airport! A glass of wine (Chard) for under $6 at an airport, unheard of!Glad I found this spot because I am a frequent Sky Harbor traveler. Keep up the great work, Sauce Sky Harbor!"}
{"text":"Really good food and isn't breaking the bank. However, I've ordered multiple times online through the EAT24 site and it sucks. First time I ordered, I paid extra for sausage in my Mac n cheese, didn't get sausage in it. Second time, I paid extra for extra bread (50 cents extra for EACH BREAD when it's free when you dine in) and they forgot it. Good food just don't expect to get what you paid for when you order online."}
{"text":"Last minute dinner plans found me at Sauce last night. Not exactly my first visit, but I had not been there in some time. 
The friend and I decided to share the roasted portobello and artichoke bruschetta which we though was quite ok but nothing sensational. Next we sampled the vegetable salad. We both found the mix of fresh vegetables with a little drizzle of dressing very tasty. This salad combines carrots, asparagus, corn, tomatoes, avocados and a little parmesean cheese. It hit all the taste sensations, there was crunch, some sweet , a little bit of creamy and a small amount of sharp from the cheese. We polished off every morsel before relishing our pizza. 

Now my absolute favorite pizza at Sauce is the rosemary potato. Firstly I for one really enjoy the thin crust on Sauces pizza. It makes me feel less guilty about eating pizza and there is more flavor to enjoy rather than eating a large amount of dough. Large perfectly sliced potatoes are nestled between cheese, spinach and tapenade on this scrumptious creation and I relished every bite. The potatoes are perfectly cooked, the spinach provides interest and the occasional bite that lends some tapenade to the combination balances out all the flavors with its salty, earthy elements. The rosemary infuses this delight with a green freshness and earthiness. We were blissfully happy with our dinner. It was the first time my friend had tried the rosemary potato and she was surprised at how good potatoes could be on a pizza!

Service is always quick and friendly and Sauce is not to hard on the wallet either. The atmosphere is very casual and the restaurant is always clean and inviting.
Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"get yourself the rosemary potato pizza with everything on it and you'll be happy, and satisfied. if i were to describe it, it would be, YUM!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a Sauce. Found the food to be extremely fresh and tasty, and the prices extremely reasonable. I got an Italian chopped salad with chicken and a cannoli.

The salad could have used more protein. I guess for $8 (plus $4 for the chicken) you can't expect much these days. But what I did get was very good. Note: Salad came with a sourdough roll that was excellent.

The cannoli was $2 and was delicious.

Note for pizza aficionados: A couple of my colleagues (non-locals) got pizzas and they have a really, really thin cracker-type crust that might not be for everyone. Toppings did look good. The pastas also looked very good."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the pizza here while waiting for a flight."}
{"text":"Loved it! Delicious food, good service, no hassle. I had the kale and salmon salad. Really loved it. Came out quickly and came with a small fresh roll."}
{"text":"I live ridiculously close to Sauce so we get take-out from there frequently and have never had a bad experience.  The Vegetable Chop Salad is full of fresh vegetables and almost makes me feel like it cancels out the pizza and booze I'm about to consume.

We've tried the Sausage and Pepperoni, which also has roasted red peppers, red onion, and crimini mushrooms, Sausage and Carmelized Onion, Portobello & Artichoke, and Rosemary Potato thin crust pizzas.  All great with a crisp crust and fresh toppings.  Those carmelized onions are downright magical!  

Each time we call and pick up the food the service has been fast and friendly.  Sauce thin crust pizza is a great choice when we want fresh pizza that's not going to throw us into a food coma.  Maybe I'll try something else on the menu, but the ones I mentioned are so good, we have a hard time choosing just one or two.  And, as a bonus, the leftovers make a great breakfast the next morning with a fried egg on top.  Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Great food, menu is different from the \"street\" locations...."}
{"text":"As a frequent traveler I make it a point to stop at Sauce and have lunch/dinner. The food is great, cheap in price, and tastes great! Unfortunately it's not at every terminal, but well worth the walk.

And for those who are health conscious they can make a veggie pizza with easy cheese. 

Good food!"}
{"text":"If you have 25 minutes to burn waiting for lunch to-go orders, this is the place for you! I ordered one of the simplest items on the menu (a vegetable salad) and I still waited over 25 minutes for my order...I'd probably still be waiting for it if I didn't flag someone down asking where the food was. About 8 people who arrived after me and were eating there got served before me. It's like they cared more about the dine-in customers more than the to-go orders. If that's the case, stick to what you're mediocre at and don't offer a to-go option."}
{"text":"Great soup love the pepperoni and mushroom pizza. Not bad for being in the airport. Next time I am in Phoenix I will be stopping in."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place before. Stopped in to get a slice of pizza before my flight. Got the butcher slice and it was by far the best I've ever had. Staff was nice, too. And it was at the airport of all places!"}
{"text":"I hate to be the party pooper, but i'm not as excited as everyone else when it comes to Sauce. I think the concept is great and their food is super fresh. However, their prices don't really bring a bang-for-buck concept, and neither are their portions.

I stood in line and the second it was time for me to order, their computers went down. Now, I completely understand that this was an unexpected circumstance (during lunch hour rush, even worse) but I believe it could've been handled better. Instead of us waiting 10-15mins (as the line grew larger) and the ladies telling us \"just one more minute!\" they could have grabbed our orders and started cooking them, letting us pay later, providing a discount for the troubles or really done any kind of effort to amend the situation. None of those happened.

I got the mixed veggie salad which came with a dinner roll. At $7, I didn't find the small (mostly leafy) salad to really be worth what I paid for and for the time that I waited (sitting, not including the computer mess). I thought the salad was fresh and simple, didn't have any surprising flavor and didn't make me rave about Sauce. I do, however, feel like a complete idiot for not checking Yelp first and ordering the secret salad, but if I ever find myself having to come back, that's what I will do.

Sorry, a mediocre 3 stars for now. Stay tuned..."}
{"text":"Love the chicken broccoli w cheese yumm"}
{"text":"This is supposed to be a semi fast food restaurant where you order at the counter, and they bring your food over when it was ready.  Took over an hour to get our pasta on a slow Wednesday night.  Staff's excuse was they forgot they ran out of pasta and had to make some.  Also forgot our appetizer for 45 mins."}
{"text":"I was so surprised to find gluten free pizza at the airport. Phoenix I love you! Sauce Pizza & Wine you were a great last meal here and in the air home. We got the gf pepperoni and of course I couldn't pass up the gf rice krispie treat staring at me from the register. Yummy pizza and treat at reasonable prices in a timely manner!One of the better gf pizzas I've had in the past 2.5 years!"}
{"text":"I really like sauce. There are a few things to keep in mind if you're going for the first time. The pizzas are more like personal pizzas rather than a feed-your-family pizza. But the pizzas are phenominal with top notch toppings and worth the $10. That pretty much goes for everything in there. It costs a little more than other places but you get what you pay for. The salads are fresh and delicious with not too much dressing which is very important to me. The chicken, pine nut and gorgonzola salad is awesome. I usually get the chicken pesto pizza which is just delicious. I totally recomend this place especially for lunch."}
{"text":"I love Sauce everything from their brick oven pizza's to there great salads. Service is also top notch here and quick. Prices are also pretty reasonable. Some of my favorites are the Turkey and Feta salad, Pepperoni and Mushroom pizza, soups here are also very good. Overall awesome spot and location which makes it very convenient for lunch."}
{"text":"Sauce is a place for some quick, tasty, quality food.  We ordered at the counter, went over to get our self serve drinks, then headed outside to the patio.  

Within minutes I received my side green salad and was really impressed by it.  Fresh, dark greens with flavorful tomatoes and crunchy croutons.  I often order side salads at restaurants and this rates pretty high up in terms of freshness and quality.  I went with the cheese pizza as well, which was too greasy for this hard earned bod......but nothing a little napkin couldn't soak up.  Most ordered pizza, but the pasta with red sauce looked pretty good too.  

Service, for what it was, was friendly and efficient as well.  Definitely one of our stand by stops for a quick meal!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this place for pickup. I ordered and apparently the fact that there are two registers - one for dine in and one for take out - doesn't matter.  I waited for several minutes at the take out register before even being acknowledged and when I was, I was informed that even though the signs say that, I still have to wait in line. Just to pick up my food.  What?

Edit: And let's add in that the chicken was under cooked and it wasn't warm anymore because I had to wait.  I'll be calling the manager and hoping the roll fills me up so I'm not tempted to eat the chicken."}
{"text":"Friendly prompt service. I ordered the gluten free Mac and Cheese. I was told it would take a few minutes extra to make. I was given a small salad for my wait. This salad was very good, with a nice raspberry vinaigrette dressing. The Mac and Cheese was rich with delicious creamy cheese sauce. The gluten free pasta was perfectly cooked. Though was hoping for spaghetti or Mac noodles. They only have rotini, which is unfortunate. This was a relaxed enjoyable restaurant. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain"}
{"text":"We were in Sky Harbor going out of town for a few days, with a fair degree of hunger. I saw the \"Sauce\" sign and have had good experiences with them in their Scottsdale location. This is really good airport food . . . It's just remarkable to find such a nice, sit-down pizza joint in an airport. The slice of thick, Chicago style pizza I grabbed on my way out was TERRIFIC, juicy, thick and full of meat. My wife had a chicken salad that she still thinks about days later . . . the chicken was wonderful, flavorful and about 180 degrees from the usual boxed salads available near an airport gate. We met the manager there, Heather, who came around to ask about our experience and she was delightful as well. All in all, this is a very solid addition to the airport and we're very pleased to know about it."}
{"text":"My girlfriend just had brain surgery and she was having difficulty hearing and was depressed. Another friend said to take her here for lunch. It was a quieter place and she could hear us all talk! We went and they were having this terrific deal 2 for $20, salad, pizza and two glasses of wine. The pizza was delicious, we shared the Chicken Pesto and it was just enough pesto, not too much. The wine list was extensive! They could not have been more accommodating (turning down the music), checking on us multiple times and ensuring our lunch was perfect!
We will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"I just finished eating my Caprese Panini, an item that is not on the menu that they created just for me. They put all the items from the Caprese Bruschetta and put it on a panini. Have them make one for you and pair it with a glass of Malbec. Great service, fabulous food and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The artichoke bruschetta had a sliver of mushroom and artichoke. The quinoa salad. Where's the avocado?  Two pieces the size of my pinkie. Asked for chicken to go with it. Not even a fourth of a breast. Been there before where both item were good and portioned right. Maybe on a Sunday night they ran out of food."}
{"text":"I give this place a one star.  Even though the food was good, it's always the customer service that leaves the impression.  Went there for dinner tonight with my wife and 2 kids.  Not busy at all.  Order salad, 2 pizzas and a sandwich.  They bring the salad out.  After the wife is about done with it, then a pizza shows up for my son.  Well, he gets through almost the whole thing by the time another pizza shows up.  I started on my pizza, by this time the wife is done with her salad, my oldest is done with his pizza and I have 2 slices gone.  They finally bring out my 6 yr old's sandwich.  One would think that you would bring all the food out at the same time.  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"We stopped in before a movie. My husband ordered the mozzarella, fontina & Basil pizza. The crust is very thin in crispy, which I prefer but many don't. If you're s thick crust person, this is probably not the place for you.  I had the turkey feta salad and green tea. The salad was HEAVEN! Absolutely delicious. I couldn't finish it and since salads don't save, I literally mourned not being able to finish the salad. It was a very sad moment. Needless to say, the salad was a decent size. I'll be back with a hunger large enough to devour the salad. It's myvgoal. Lol"}
{"text":"First time. Ordered using Yelp! Linked to a 10% first time user discount which I did not receive from the Yelp! site.
The Suprema Pizza was delicious! I asked them to hold the Red Peppers and they got it right! Chicken Salad was good with candied walnuts and Gorgonzola Cheese.
Will definitely be back and will happily refer my friends."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that this used to be our \"go to\" restaurant anytime we wanted good food and service.  Unfortunately, something has gone wrong.  The last time we went, my daughter got macaroni and cheese that was undercooked and cold.  This time, we had all sorts of issues. Both containers of iced tea had a brewing issue and half the soda options were flat.  My daughter went up after our meal and ordered a dessert which never came. I had to ask the Manager for a refund and got no explanation as to what happened.  The food was fine, but not up to the usual standards. It is unfortunate, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"I wanted to write about my experience at the Sauce location in Chandler, Arizona.  My husband and I stopped in for lunch & ordered a pizza.  Our toppings included spinach, caramelized onions, tomatoes and extra cheese. When we got our pizza there was basil all over the top, we were starving so we started picking off the basil.  A manager walked by and asked how our meal was, we told her what happened and she she didn't care, said some fake apology and walked off. Next to our pizza was a mound of basil that we picked off and set on a napkin, it was evident that we weren't happy with the topping being on our pizza and we took it off. What is the point of going around asking how pizza is, and when we say it isn't right, nothing is done to rectify the situation? What a joke for a manager. Twenty minutes later, another worker walked by asking how our pizza was, as once again, the mound of basil should have been evident enough that something wasn't right. She made no comment about it and obviously could have cared less how our pizza was. I have been to many establishments where, if the order isn't right, they care and they do something to make the situation better. I think this experience is more insulting since a manager walks around pretending to care how our meal is, and just walks away after you tell them it isn't right. Maybe more training should be done in order to make sure someone really acts like a manager and does this with a purpose because this woman was a joke."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at this Sauce location. The service was friendly, quick, and very attentive. The food was well executed (we ordered a chicken Caesar salad and two pizzas) and delivered to our table quickly. Several times during the meal a server stopped by to check on us and we even had the pleasure of meeting one of the managers who made a personal visit to ensure that we were satisfied. I will definitely be dining here again in the near future."}
{"text":"This is a great little place for a quick, healthy bite. The staff is friendly, the food is yummy and the store is clean. We brought our kids here and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"At the Sauce airport location, I  chose the build your own gourmet pizza very delicious. It's also good to know with their salads, you can ask for a half order. I had the caprese salad. Lovely,as well. And if you don't finish all your pizza, you can take it through security. Big :-)"}
{"text":"Paid almost $9.00 for a salad that was so small it was barely a side salad. Asked for a large drink and they gave me a small. I am extremely disappointed with this place, and will not go again."}
{"text":"Always great food.  I always get the meatball Paninis which is delicious.  Also I prefer the thin crust pizza.  Only slight concern is they bring out the food staggered sometimes and it is awkward when one person doesn't have there food for a while."}
{"text":"OMG! The sauce. The aroma is intoxicating. The thin crust pizza. The salads. Delish!!!"}
{"text":"Three Words: Macaroni and Cheese!  You can also opt for a side of mac & cheese to save room for one of their fresh salads or a thin crust pizza.

Sauce is a casual place good for both lunch and dinner. During summer they offer a summer sampler which includes a pizza, salad and 2 glasses of wine for only $20!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is average. It's not bad, but it's not the best pizza I've ever had, either. Was it worth $9.75 for a 12\" personal pizza? No. I paid with a Fox Restaurants gift card, so I can't complain too much about a \"free for me\" meal. I would probably not come back again if it was on my dime. Also, my pizza was a little bit burnt on the crust. It was edible, but I was surprised that they served me slightly burnt pizza at the price of $9.75. My fiance's wasn't-- in fact, they remade his entire pizza and didn't even send it out to us because it had a hole in the crust."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! I love the thin crust pizzas, my favorite is the \"Potato & Rosemary\" pizza...so unique & delicious, & I love that it's Vegetarian & still packed with flavor.

The Vegetable salad is also delicious! Loaded with chopped fresh veggies & a nice mild dressing, makes you feel like you're eating Healthy even though you're eating pizza :)

No complaints here, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"They literally close an hour and a half before their scheduled close every night. Update your hours please"}
{"text":"SPOILER ALERT: Order the Secret Salad!

Here's another reason why Yelp rocks: you get the inside scoop before you ever arrive at the place. Thanks to reading Richard Z's review on Sauce, I knew all about their Secret Salad. So, I walk up and order it like I've been there before (hehehe...only I hadn't. Suckerrrs!). They fell for my little ploy and handed over the goods. It was tasty too! It had salami, prosciutto, and...honestly I don't know what was in it (it's a secret). It might not have even been prosciutto; but whatever was in there was mighty good! Italian meats, mixed greens, tomatoes, cheese...I'm definitely ordering it again. [Oh, I took a top-secret photo of the infamous salad too. See, how I risk my life for you Yelp?]

The pizzas are good too. They look big, like you can share them, but if you're a full-grown man with a decent appetite, consider getting your own. See, the circumference is impressive, but they're paper thin. Still, they were tasty. We tried some Potato one and a Pepperoni & Sausage. I wouldn't get the Potato one again...but I was kind of glad I tried it. Flavor was really good on the Pepperoni & Sausage Pizza, but I just wanted more.

Lastly, the Mac & Cheese was gooooood. Decadent, but good. It was almost more like an Alfredo sauce, but not quite. They also offer it with Broccoli and Chicken in it (I'm not sure if that's supposed to be a secret...if it was oops!). I'd like to give that a shot next time though.

Overall, I'll be back. Good stuff here at Sauce. But let's do away with these \"secret\" shenanigans (lame), or us Yelpers will continue to out every single one of them."}
{"text":"Had the spicy sausage pize and vegetable salad.  Came in at 12:15 and the place was packed with the lunchtime rush.  But we still had our food in about 7 minutes after ordering.

Net:  Very solid food at reasonable prices.  Really healthy menu, and has several gluten-free options for those who require that.  Great lunch place if you're in a bit of a hurry but are looking to try to stay on the healthy side."}
{"text":"My experience was just average. Food was not memorable and the service was slow. Food did not come out together. We ate our pizza before the salad ever showed up. Seriously?! The couple next to us received their pizza as an after thought as well and they got a canned apology. The manager should have comped them something at best .. I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Alex the pizza maker was great made sure our pizza was good and that we were satisfied with what we had.  If ever in the airport again I will be going there for pizza not sure if there are any outside of the airport."}
{"text":"Quaint little pizza shop with great food. I just had a roast beef and mozzarella panini and the macaroni and cheese. Near perfect taste and not over powering on flavor. Maybe adding a bit of bacon  to the mac and cheese as a twist  (because everything taste better with bacon...right). This is a great spot with light fare."}
{"text":"I've had high expectations for this place and wanted to try their Caesar salad. My boyfriend and I got it to go so we didn't see it then. Once we got home, I saw that most, if not all, of the lettuce was very brown. Also, my dressing came in two very tiny containers. The lettuce was disgusting and the dressing did not taste like true Caesar. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I've had several of the pizzas and pasta here and the kids loved the panini. Is a bit pricey but fun atmosphere. You order it at a cash register and they bring it out to you. It isn't anything phenomenal but if you are in the area it is fast and easy."}
{"text":"Love this place. The macaroni and spicy chicken pasta is amazing!  Very consistent. I have tried the sausage pepperoni pizza, never disappointed.  The service is superb!  Five stars all that way!"}
{"text":"Finally an airport restaurant with good food and good service.  I have made it a habit to stop by Sauce when I am at Sky Harbor Terminal 4.  The restaurant is actually managed like a restraurant and the staff takes pride in it.  I have only had pizza when I am here, but am happy nonetheless.  The food is reasonably priced and delivered within only a few minutes.  I would highly recommend this establishment.  It also has a bit of local flare.

Ironically, the food at this Sauce restaurant is prepared better than the other two locations I have visited.  

Seating can be difficult, however, the restaurant is at an airport, hence traffic flows cannot always be controlled.

Thanks for opening up such a fine place at Sky Harbor!"}
{"text":"The \"pizza\" here is very, very bad. Thin crust is never my favorite to begin with, but when it's made especially well (think &pizza), I can dig it. This pizza was just... nothingness. It nearly evaporated between my fingertips and the flavor was mad weak. It didn't even taste that fresh - almost had the consistency of a pizza from hours ago that had been reheated. I came right before closing, so that proposed scenario probably isn't too farfetched.

Their mac and cheese WAS really good though, so a star back for that."}
{"text":"A quick meal on the way out of town.  I love having the local options now in the airport.  Not having to choose some not so healthy fast food option is out.  We frequent other Sauce locations in the Valley and this one was just as consistent.  They make it quick and package it so it's easy to take with me to the plane.  We had our favorites the Chicken pinenut salad and Mac'n Cheese.  As always they did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Great food, fast and delicous. A little pricey compared to places that serve equal types of food.

Always clean friendly people, I would highly recomend.

So many favorites hard to list them all."}
{"text":"Nice place to eat in the Phoenix airport - got a great special of a pizza, salad, and 2 glasses of wine for $20.  All were excellent and high above airport food standards.  Plus the staff was incredibly friendly!"}
{"text":"Salad was good, and the table off someone else's table looked good, but not a good spot for an airport location unless they speed up their service or you have 2 hours to kill. Took 15min just to get a salad with only 4 customers in the place... I'm scared to find out how long it would take on a weekend or for a pizza! 

Also bread tasted stale with a weird after taste...and my throat feels a little swollen...


Just FYI, the Sauce locations throughout the valley have always been 5 stars for food and service"}
{"text":"Based on it being airport pizza it was amazing especially coming hungry after a flight, but if this wasn't in an airport I wouldn't choose to eat here. The place is trying too hard to be trendy, and I feel like they lack in the flavor department. 

We got macaroni and cheese as well as a pizza (9 inch thin crust). The macaroni and cheese was WAY better than the pizza. The only thing that would have made the mac and cheese better is a slice or two of bacon. But this place is supposed to be a focus on pizza. The sauce was tasteless. The pepperonis didn't have that pop to them. The dough was good, which is probably because of the brick oven then cook it in.

Our bill was 18 dollars, so acceptable for airport food, but totally unacceptable unless it's a downtown main street place."}
{"text":"Cool spot in a still developing complex. Eclectic playlist including Peter Murphy's 'Cuts You Up' - which I don't think I've ever heard in a restaurant, friendly staff and great flavors atop a crispy thin crust pie - ready in just a few minutes on this Monday night at 7pm. Nice little Caprese skewer app to start and the Supreme pie washed down with a bottle of Sierra Nevada. Great place for a quick, flavorful pizza across from the new Home2 by Hilton on Queen Creek and Dobson."}
{"text":"I come in all the time and my last two times have been horrible. Food tasted awful. The manger is very rude you would think since she's a manger she would try and be polite to fix her employees mistakes but wasn't the case. Not impressed with the management."}
{"text":"Seriously $12 for a mediocre, minimal topping bland pizza? There are 4 dime sized pieces of chicken on this pesto chicken. Next time I will wait for Grimaldis"}
{"text":"Ive been here probably 10 times before tonight, usually great. Tonight, not so much. The cashier didn't know how to ring my order, pepperoni and portobello mushroom. She also didn't know how to count change back, a serious pet peeve of mine, it's not that hard. The small plates that are put on the table were all dirty, not from someone using them just dirty from sitting there. And the table itself needed to be wiped off."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken sausage and supreme pizza and a brushetta appetizer. The pizza cam out first and the brushetta didn't come out until after we were half done with the pizza after we asked twice about it.  
The chicken sausage was ok. It mak have been better on hand tossed rather than thin crust.
The supreme was better. One thing missing at Saiucd is the sauce on the pizza. Kind of mid leading."}
{"text":"Went here the other night with a friend and service was impeccable! The pizza didn't come out quite how we had ordered it the first time, but they quickly made us a new one that we could both eat!
Simply another amazing Sauce location.
And shout out to Jordan who took our order for checking on us and making sure we were taken care of all night!"}
{"text":"All good natural ingredients the bruschetta is rocking good unfortunately I haven't eaten a lot of things there cause I can't get away from the bruschetta. they have really good ice tea to. Nice and clean environment kind of reminds me of a chipotle on the inside just to give you an idea of the feel and what it looks like inside."}
{"text":"I like meeting my mommy friends here b/c it's fast casual & kid friendly. This store is located in pretty Downtown Ocotillo and it's so relaxing to sit out in the patio. 

My favorite salad is the pine nut chicken with the juicy tomatoes & creamy Gorgonzola - perfect combination! The 12\" thin crust pizza are good but I like to see more toppings on some of them.  Their lunch specials are a great deal for $7.50 you get:

any soup + salad or
any salad + pasta or
any soup + pasta
a drink is included too!

The good: 
- service is awesome even for fast causal
- food is fresh & made from scratch

The bad: 
- dinner is quiet here, think they need to start a happy hour or something

Secret salad sounds delicious.......I must try!"}
{"text":"Gluten free options are great. Mac and cheese is the best! Giving 3 stars because the recently made some menu adjustments and cut their salad options in half. This was one of my go to places for salads so it's pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"The service here was a disaster.   Called 15 minutes ahead for pick up on my way home from work.  I was told that it would take 10 minutes.   I get there, pay and I am told it will take 10 minutes more so I figure they must have gotten busy.   15 minutes pass...20 minutes, I ask about my order  \"still in oven\" I am told.    30 minutes in I am ready to get a refund and the lady behind counter just realizes it's been sitting in a warmer the entire time.  I get stuck with cold stale pizza to feed my family.  Thanks Sauce!!!"}
{"text":"Very impressive airport fare.  One of the better thin crust pizzas I have ever had.  Recommend pizza with caramelized onion.

Also good large $1 cookie!"}
{"text":"Wood-fired pizzas.  Chopped salads.  What's not to like?

Sauce offers a consistently good product.  My portabella and artichoke pizza ($10) was perfectly round, and enough for 1 large serving or two small servings.  The crust was thin and even and nicely charred on the bottom.  The slices were easy to pick up and fold.  The sauce and cheese were good, but not outstanding.  The portabella mushrooms were cut into ribbons and looked almost like anchovies.  The artichokes were the star of the dish.  Many places will just peel off thin layers of the artichoke heart for a topping, but Sauce actually sliced the artichoke heart into chunks, so it stayed juicy and had some substance.  It was a nice presentation.

My wife was not enamored with her chopped vegetable salad ($7), although I liked it.  I thought the chopped asaragus and corn added some distinctive flavors.  Dining with my wife often requires footnotes.  (1) She subbed feta cheese for parmesan and was happy with that tradeoff.  (2) She noticed they forgot avocado in the salad, which the restaurant corrected by bringing out a small dish of avocado.  Accidents happen.  At least they fixed it promptly and courteously.

It's not the food that bugs me at Sauce; it's the atmosphere.  They're serving an upscale product in a fast casual setting.  After ordering at the counter, food is served in a dining area not unlike an office cafeteria.  The patio is no better, overlooking a parking lot and a dumpster.  It's not a place to reminisce over a glass of wine (which they sell.)

Am I expecting too much from a fast casual restaurant with reasonable prices?... probably.  I'm calling this a \"me\" problem and giving 4 stars based on the food alone."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good things about this place, so we finally paid a visit.  

The decor was not what I expected.  It reminded me of Chipotle (burritos).  A big menu on the wall, you stand in line and when you get to the front you place your order and pay.  I had thought this would be more like Grimaldi's.

So the pizza comes.  It was small (that's how they do it).  But it was tasty.  Was it outstanding?  Not really.  It was good.  But didn't seem to live up to the hype.

As my rating says, it's fine.  But nothing special with a disappointing ambiance."}
{"text":"Meh. Wanted this to be good. Ordered three pizzas. Ideas were good but execution wasn't. All three had burned crusts.  Not just a little in the bottom. Each was half black and charred around half the pie. And they aren't properly kneeding the dough. All three had large bubbles around the edges. One covered almost an entire piece. 


Finally, they didn't cut any of the three so that a piece would actually come apart. It was as if someone went over the things lightly to mark where they should've cut. No thanks. Back to Sal's!"}
{"text":"Pizza was ho hum okay.  Nothing special.  Had the portabello and artichoke pizza with added wild mushroom.  The toppings were scant, almost non-existent.  With almost \"no toppings\", it feels like eating flavored crusts. :)  The pizza didn't slow me down after lunch, which is always nice."}
{"text":"Finally! Local food comes to the airport...and it's good!! On a recent trip, I was tickled pink to see that Sauce had opened their doors and this morning, I actually got to enjoy their food. But get this...instead of enjoying their common lunch and dinner items, it was 7 AM and guess what? They serve a delicious breakfast as well! I learned that their breakfast sandwiches come on flat bread that's made from their homemade pizza dough (yum), so I ordered the ham, cheese, egg and tomato breakfast sandwich without the cheese. When the sandwich came out, I quickly realized that this sandwich could easily feed two! Unfortunately, I was just a one though so I enjoyed half and saved the other half for later. The sandwich comes with deliciously salty breakfast potatoes as well. Sam Fox doesn't disappoint at his Valley restaurants and he didn't disappoint with the airport breakfast as well! I wish they served breakfast at every Sauce location (maybe one day!?) but in the meantime, I now have something to look forward to when I visit Sky Harbor."}
{"text":"Sauce is an oasis in the Phoenix Airport.  My wife and I were blown away by a great experience at Sauce.  How rare is it to eat a sit-down meal in an airport (at a very reasonable price-point, mind you), and actually forget -- for a few minutes, at least -- that you're sitting in a busy airport?  Very refreshing.

The two of us split a pizza and a cookie (the cookies are over-sized; a beautiful thing).  Our total bill was $10.83 (see the picture I posted for proof), and it was plenty of food to fill the two of us up.

The pepperoni pizza was tasty; the pizza sauce lived up to its namesake at this spot.  

The seating area was clean and cozy.  Wood floors and wood tables made it feel downright classy.

The service at the counter was friendly and quick -- two great ingredients at an airport.

Well done, Sauce!"}
{"text":"During one of my business trips last week, I decided to try a lesson in time management and actually get to the airport on time. Not only did I succeed, I arrived early enough to grab a bite to eat so I'm not stuck with peanuts. Enter: Sauce.

Not too shabby of a place for being inside an airport, I guess. I'll have to agree with a reviewer below me - the service is \"ehh\" and they don't care about much more than taking an order. For example, it was my first time and I had a couple questions about the \"build your own pizza\" and the guy at the cash register was less than thrilled. I ordered a glass of chardonnay and he asked me if I wanted ice... oh God. Why didn't I just turn around at that point?

So I ordered a basic pizza. It had some fancy name to it, but it was just a cheese pizza. Thin crust, minimal sauce (the irony) and not much to be remembered. So I ordered another glass of chardonnay and sucked it up. 

Note: The seating arrangement is awful. There are bar stools and tables and you won't find a seat for awhile because the tables seat up to 4 people, and if 1 person took that table - they won't seat you there. 

However, it is probably the best you'll get if you need to dine in at the airport - unless you want McDonalds or some crap Mexican food. The prices aren't bad (about $9 for a whole pizza and $5 for chardonnay) along with a variety of other items (pasta, salad, sandwiches, breakfast food). Maybe I just ordered the wrong stuff, but I don't see myself going back for round two."}
{"text":"An casual dining experience with fantastic thin crust pizza! We have tried their sandwiches, salads, and desserts, and they are all delicious. The cashiers, cooks, and other workers are always friendly. The manager always makes sure to walk by our table and ask us about the food and how we are doing, which is very much very much appreciated. This restaurant is always clean, and the workers turn the tables very quickly. Speaking of quick, the food is always served fast. Of course, when the place is full, the service speed adjust. They have a nice atmosphere with lots of windows, and a cute patio are outside. I have always had a great experience here, and I definitely recommend coming here if you're a fan of thin crust pizza."}
{"text":"The food is very good!!  My daughter and I ordered the classic Caesar salad and chicken pesto pizza (hand stretched). The chicken on the pizza was tossed with pesto instead of pesto on the pizza itself. I ordered a glass of One Hope wine, which donates 50% to help children with autism. We ended our meal with the Nutella trifle. All the food was excellent! The dessert was probably the best trifle I've ever had. The only downside was we had to wait a little long than other customers for our food. The manager did come by and ask what our order was and the food came out quickly after. Since the food was excellent, the longer wait time wasn't a big deal!"}
{"text":"Imagine the perfect place to chill in an airport.... now, imagine Sauce- Pizza & Wine and forget the airline lounge!

True, we live in a world of imperfection.  I had to request a menu in order to take my time and order as they don't offer a waiting service.  However, after ordering the food and drinks, I was quite satisfied.  Drinks were very reasonable and the food was excellent.  I highly recommend the Mediterranean pizza (Basil, tomatoes, and cheese) and the Bruschetta.  The pizza is thin but enough to split for two and the bruschetta is voluptuous, with drizzled balsamic vinaigrette to die for!

When ordering another beer, I didn't expect the cashier to start flirting with me (a bit unprofessional if you ask me), but they got the job done.

Overall, it is with genuine enthusiasm that I suggest dumping the airline lounge for Sauce - Pizza & Lounge!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday and got a cup of the tomato soup and the wild mushroom pizza, and I was very disappointed. Did Sauce change the tomato soup they carry? or did they just run out yesterday and had to run to a grocery store to pick up a different tuscan tomato soup? (Kidding, but that's exactly what it tasted like; like it was from a cheap grocery store). Whatever it was, the tomato soup yesterday was not the same kind of tomato soup I've been eating here for years. It was very watered-down, not thick at all like it used to be, and no sweetness (the reason why I loved the Sauce tomato soup more than any tomato soup), it actually tasted sour. Additionally, the wild mushroom pizza is tasty, but I've had much better truffle mushroom pizzas elsewhere, such as La Bocca on Mill Ave. Sauce does not put enough truffle oil in their wild mushroom pizza. Also, the pizza was not even cut properly; four of the pizza slices were still combined together as someone didn't take the time to simply cut through it correctly. How hard is it to cut a pizza correctly? Seems like this location has lousy service. I am really hoping all of the Sauce locations didn't change to that watered down & sour tomato soup. Big mistake. -_-"}
{"text":"I discovered Sauce Pizza and Wine in August. I have been enjoying them several times per week since; and have never been disappointed. Like me, they are not perfect but imperfection is minimal and has been quickly and professionally resolved. I most enjoy their unique salads (as they are the most healthy); with a pizza, pasta, or sandwich on special occasions. They are happy to add meat to veggie salads, and never blink when I ask for less dressing, or to have the dressing on the side. Sauce is like getting chef recipes, cafe portion sizes, and diner prices. I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Had lunch, it was good. Nice sized portion of lasagna. Wish it came with another piece of bread for sopping up the sauce I'd go again."}
{"text":"Great woodfired cooked pizza; excellent choice if you happen to be flying thru Phoenix airport."}
{"text":"Nice spot for lunch in Chandler.  Quick.  Good quality.  Salads, sandwiches, pizzas and pastas.  Nothing was spectacular but also nothing was bad.  Group of 6 ordered 2 pizzas, a pasta and 3 salads.  

Chicken, spinach, and apple salad was better than mixed green and Caesar.  

The real highlight of the meal was the portobello and artichoke bruschetta."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed!  I've been here many times and have previously left great reviews but my recent order was a big let down.

I placed a Yelp order to go for pick up and ordered my usual Sauce favorite, the Chicken Caesar Salad Pizza on hand tossed crust.  I also ordered caprese bruschetta.  While I didn't take a picture of the bruschetta it was made so sloppily.  I was surprised by the presentation but it still tasted delicious.  

However the pizza/salad is basically inedible.  This isn't the usual quality of food I have come to expect from Sauce.  I've ordered this menu item a dozen times at least over the years.  But this time the lettuce is brown and wilted and there is an excess of dressing making it goopy and inedible.  I'm so bummed.  Sauce, how did this pass your usual flawless quality control?  That's what I love about Sauce it's been consistently good food, don't fail us now!"}
{"text":"Very average pizza, but liked the thin crust. Mac & cheese tasted like it was from a box. The Caesar salad was the highlight of the whole meal. No beer on tap. Only a small selection of canned or bottled."}
{"text":"Great place! Amazing food! Amazing prices! The team here is amazing!!!!! We had a slight mixup with my pizza... they not only corrected it but fully explained what happened! Quickly remaking my pizza and even gave me the pizza that was messed up! :) LUNCH TOMORROW! 

Great experience! 

Thank you Sauce!"}
{"text":"I never been in the restaurant itself, but often order food from it through \"Door Dash\" service. Love the salads! Good job guys!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant hoping for a nice dinner. I felt I was eating Italian food in a cafeteria. What a disappointment. Pass this place by. There... I just did you a favor!!!"}
{"text":"Not a lot of flavor.   The crust is more like a cracker (not my preference).   At least it was made to order."}
{"text":"This is a great place for pizza, salad or sandwich.  Sometimes they skimp on pizza toppings but have always resolved my request. The spinach salad is a fav but I always request the chicken to be warmed up as I can't do cold unless it's Grandma's or I'm drunk! The sauce and meatballs are super."}
{"text":"Our PHX airport dining options are getting better and better...

I purchased food from this airport Sauce location twice to date and I've been impressed - their food is consistent with their restaurants around town.  While their food isn't five star worthy, it's pretty damn good for the price and the fast-casual model.  I recommend the vegetable salad (I add turkey for extra protein sometimes) and their turkey, ham, salami panini (I order mine without ham).  

Service is friendly enough although it's not the fastest, so I don't recommend dining here if you're cutting it close trying to catch your flight!

Fox Restaurant Concepts are taking over Sky Harbor - today I noticed that they also opened a Modern Burger and Blanco between gates A4 and A5 (terminal 4)."}
{"text":"Has always been great! Great salads and pizza. Reasonable prices. Saves me a trip to old town Gilbert. Don't lose your mojo."}
{"text":"The service and food was great up to a point. I had a personal pizza with chicken sausage and my wife ordered the lasagna bowl. The flavors and service were fantastic. But halfway through my wife's was on your bowl she noticed a long black hair in her food. At that point we got up and left didn't mention anything didn't want to ruin anybody else's night but it definitely did put a heavy negativity on the establishment in our eyes. What I try Tagan uncertain at this point want something like that has happened it's really hard for us to get over it."}
{"text":"This place is a no brainer 5 stars for me.  It was the $3.75 beers that really caught my attention, but at the risk of looking like a lush to the locals (or non-locals since I was in an airport), I decided to grab a bite to eat.  Thank god I did.  I ordered the Turkey Feta salad and it was UN-believable.  Comprised of mixed greens, turkey, feta, corn, almonds, cucumber, tomato, and avocado; it was honestly one of the best salads I have ever had; and that's saying a lot (lettuce fiend).  You choose your dressing from an available list, so I can't guarantee how good this dish will be if you venture outside of the balsamic and red wine vinegar choices that I decided on; although I'm sure this one is difficult to screw up.

Short and sweet....

Service: Awesome
Beer: Cheap
Food: Must try
Ambiance: Above average considering... (airport)

Sidenote: Ask for a beer glass and you will get a vessel large enough to hold (conservatively) 5 ounces.  I laughed about that one."}
{"text":"Just checked out sauce for the first time. Love this place. They have an Italian chop salad that is perfect. It's savory, a little sweet, and a little spicy. It hits all of the right textures too. I tried the pizza too. Pepperoni and mushroom.  It was awesome. Pro tip, if you ask for hand stretched dough, it will come to you a little thicker. Otherwise, it is scooper thin.  Dessert was nice too. Pizza cookie is where it is at. Staff was super friendly and helpful. All around a great place. Make plans to stop by!"}
{"text":"Great Caesar, great pasta. Can't believe I am in an airport."}
{"text":"It's Sauce...you kinda expect the outcome if you have eaten at other Sauce places.  I had the pasta and meatballs and my friend had the Quinoa, Beet, and Arugula salad.  Her salad was really great she said and she ate every bite.  My pasta was good and the meatballs were wonderful!  I love Sauce's red sauce...not too tangy and not too sweet, just a great balance of goodness.  

This is a new restaurant location and things seemed to run well.  We waited maybe five minutes after ordering and sitting down.  No complaints and I'm sure I'll be back while working in the area."}
{"text":"I love Sauce at Norbert's and this location definitely has a more limited menu, but it is worth arriving early at the airport. The food was hot, fast and delicious and what really earns them the 5 stars was I placed an order for spaghetti with sauce and no cheese. I didn't specify that I needed dairy free sauce because I don't often run into this problem, but when it arrived, the sauce had a telltale light color and so I asked (because lots of people are about to be trapped in a very small space with me so more than just my comfort was at stake).

The server checked in the kitchen and had them make a new dish with the pizza sauce which has no cheese. The corrected the error very quickly even though it was at least partly my fault."}
{"text":"Recently, I enjoyed a delicious lunch at the Sauce restaurant in Phoenix so I decided to check out what this airport location had to offer. I figured it had to be better than the peanuts and pretzels the airline would offer, right? And oh boy was it better! 

You can order and pay with the hostess or at the counter which helps speed up the ordering process for those needing to rush off to their gate. 

*Caprese Salad with Crostini*
The salad came with cubes of fresh  mozzarella, diced tomatoes, freshly toasted crostini pieces, and mesclun (assorted small, young salad leaves). The fresh balsamic vinaigrette was the perfect pairing with the salad. I wasn't too hungry and found the half size portion to be just perfect!

I love that all the menu items come with a fresh baked roll and pat of butter - perfect for dipping in soup as I saw other guests enjoying. 

All in all, quite pleased with the reasonable prices, friendly servers, cleanliness of the restaurant, and healthy food options. Did I mention this is inside the airport?!"}
{"text":"So happy to have a Sauce close to home! Been going here since the first one in Tucson. Everything was great, as always. But PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE Sauce Management.. Get the white chocolate out of the pizza cookie! YUCK! And it's hard to avoid! LOL! But the bites with no white chocolate were great!"}
{"text":"We've always had pizza at Sauce. Yesterday afternoon we totally enjoyed their pasta with meatballs! They use a spiral shaped noodle. The sauce was good and the meatballs were even tastier! You get a warm roll and butter as well. 
My daughter nearly finished the entire cookie and gelato desert by herself. Warm and oh so rich! 
Friendly servers. Only suggestion I'd make is when it's not crowded and noisy, they could probably turn the music down."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Home2Suites across the street and after a long day in Tucson and Phoenix wanted something close for dinner. I even did Yelp order here to pick up and it worked flawlessly. Ordered a build-your-own pizza which was perfect and my favorite thin crust, along with a humongous caprese salad. Order was ready exactly when promised, 20 mins later, and I appreciated the staff brought out the food and showed it to me, rather than just shoving a bag in my face. I'd come back here again in a minute, and do the Yelp ordering again."}
{"text":"Best food deal I've ever gotten at an airport!  The price is right and the food is great!  I hope I make it through Phoenix again just so I can eat here again!"}
{"text":"I enjoy eating Gluten Free and was delighted to know Sauce offers a Gluten free crust. I have enjoyed Sauce it multiple locations and was excited one was built close to my home. I placed an order to go tonight and they brought me out my pizza and opened the box. I immediately noticed how burnt the edge of the pizza was. I thought about just taking it how it was but I really do enjoy this crust from Sauce. So I asked if they could re make it without the crust being burnt. The nice young male took it back the kitchen and asked the male
cook in the back if he could re make it and the male cook seemed annoyed. He told the male who was asking \"that's just how it is\" and the young male asked again if he could just remake it. The male in the kitchen again seemed agitated and said that he could but the pizza was just not going to be \"done\" in the middle. I wanted to say something to the cook because I have had this pizza multiple times around the valley. The young male had to come
To me to tell me the pizza wouldn't be done. I was completely lost and had thought to myself, \"this is Sauce right?\" Either way I waited and the young male brought out the uncooked pizza. It looked as if they threw it in the oven for 1-2 min and pulled it out. I was done at that point. I walked out of there and ate something else. I called the manager and let them know but at this point I don't really want to go back. I don't understand because I have had this pizza, (Gluten free crust), and never had this issue. I believe that there are some training opportunities to be done at this location..."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. I had a salmon and kale salad, and the bf had the pizza. Only complaint, my salad came out a few minutes after we placed our order and then had to wait at least 10+ minutes for his pizza. I don't understand when people come to an establishment to dine together they can't aim to serve the food at the same time. It's just awkward.  Other than that, I was pleased with my meal."}
{"text":"Ordered pasta with meatballs.  Pasta is hard.  Meatball not very good either.  At least my salad was salad and was sadly the only thing that wasn't a disappoint in taste."}
{"text":"We typically love Sauce but this location is not up to standards.  They up-charged the summer sampler on us (the Chandler and Scottsdale locations never do that for the same meal) and when I mentioned it, the manager was argumentative with me.  When I went to pay she then proceeded to complained to me about using my gift card. She was super rude. We love Sauce food but will now only go to the Chandler and Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I would love to bring it back to my home city. I'm in love great food and vibes!"}
{"text":"Tried this out with some coworkers and picked up the suprema. It came out quickly and cooked perfectly. Given the price point it was loaded with a decent amount of toppings. The wait staff was attentive and timely with really no issues at all. I think the drink I ordered (strawberry basil lemonade) was delicious (no refills a tad of a bummer). Overall, I would definitely come back and try out some of their other offerings."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with this little restaurant. We wanted to go to the Texas place next door originally but the pasta caught my eye. We also didn't have much time and didn't think we had time for a whole sit down dinner at the Texas kitchen. So we went with Sauce. Which was a great  choice!

The bruschetta which is only $4 was SOOOOO good! Very fresh, warm and different than the usual. I highly recommend this dish here. I got the chicken broccoli pasta, which was bigger than I had imagined. And the hubs got a margarita pizza (which they have under a different name) it was a nice thin crust. We also got a Caesar salad. It was also bigger than we had imagined. All the food was very tasty and like I had said different than usual. It was like a modern Italian food. Very good! Also very affordable. All our food, and drinks came out to $25.

I must comment that the service here was amazing. You put your order in right when you walk up, the line goes really quickly. The cashier was so patient, helpful and upbeat. There was no tip jar and none of the employees were looking for any tips which was really nice to know they're not working that extra bit for a tip. 

They also have a pretty extensive wine menu. Lots of pretty bottles on display and info about them. Yay!

I expected to wait a long time for the food but we got our appetizer, salad and entree all in 10 min or less. It was plated on nice clean dinnerware, served with a polite smile and they picked up the dishes as you finished. They were so attentive.

All in all, the service = 10 and the food = 10! Amazing! I will be back every month when I fly outta PHX. Can't wait for next month!"}
{"text":"Normally I really enjoy sauce, but I typically go to the Scottsdale location. Very disappointed with the service and food received at this location.

My boyfriend and I shared a Cesar salad and Mac and cheese. The Cesar salad came out in an appropriate time and was good, I felt the portion was a bit small but nevertheless a decent salad. 

The problem arises with the Mac and cheese, after receiving and finishing our salad, we continued to wait another 10 minutes until our Mac and cheese came out. Note that it's been about 25-30 minutes since the original order was placed. Once it finally came out it was not only cold but the pasta wasn't fully cooked. The two bites I took from it were crunchy and stiff. Clearly the pasta wasn't fully cooked and then the pasta was just left sitting out on the counter before the servers realized where it was suppose to go. We sent the pasta back explaining issues we had with it. The staff apologized and said that they would remake it.

Some time later our second Mac and cheese comes out and what do you know it's cold and under cooked. It could have been the same one from last time for all I know. 

I don't understand how the same dish can be cooked wrong twice in a row but it is really disappointing because I usually love sauce Mac and cheese. Don't see myself coming back to this location anytime soon. 

Also on a side note, we had to ask for bread once they brought out the Mac and cheese and the salads. Not sure if this location is run differently but normally a side of bread is brought to you with your order without having to ask."}
{"text":"In moving from US Airways reservations to a position at the airport, I have had the chance to experience some of the offerings.

Prices are lower than many airport offerings...service is fast...pizzas are good...

The spaghetti sauce...somewhat underwhelming.

No real \"connection\" between the server and customer, which, at an airport location, is really not a surprise.

For airport food...it is OK."}
{"text":"Great pizzas (even gf) and salads"}
{"text":"Just tried tonight for the first time, at any location!  I had the pesto pasta with a side salad.  I added the red wine vinegar dressing. He had the pepperoni pizza.  Iced teas to drink but the wine and beer menu looked ok too.  Only  \"meh\" item was the sopressata asparagus bruschetta.  It came out after the salad and was difficult to eat at best.  New associates but everybody had hustle and learning quickly it seemed.  Everything TaSTED delicious!  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! It is super bright, the staff is cheerful and attentive and the food is delicious. I had the chicken and pine nut salad, substituted the vinaigrette for champagne dressing. I had a side of mac n' cheese and the supreme pizza, hand tossed without mushrooms. Super yum!"}
{"text":"Not very good. The customer service was ok but the pizza was burnt. The table to my left me got their pizzas with an apology for how long it took - the table to my right got their pizza with an apology for how burnt it was-\"would you like to munch on this until your other pizza come?\" And mine was totally burnt but I was so fed up I just left. And it wasn't cut properly!! Lame 
Won't be back"}
{"text":"I really like the food here.  What I don't like is when you pay at the register, the receipt has a space to add a tip.  I've ordered my own food and gotten my own drinks and I am expected to give a tip.  I would leave a tip after I have actually received a service, but I am not leaving one before."}
{"text":"I never thought I would want to arrive earlier than necessary at an airport... to eat!  Well, now that Sauce is open in PHX Sky Harbor, I make it a point to show up extra early for my flights.

Friendly staff and quick, efficient service make Sauce an oasis in the middle of traditionally less than stellar dining options at the airport.  The whole process couldn't be easier - order at the register, take your number and grab a seat.  I like the long high top tables - great for airport people watching.  In less time than it takes to connect to the airport WiFi, your food will be ready.

I have yet to venture farther into the menu than pizza, because I am perfectly happy with that.  A thin crust pizza paired with a generous glass of wine is a nice pre-travel treat, in my opinion.  And, doesn't that glass of wine make the whole security checkpoint process that much more tolerable?  :)"}
{"text":"Mozzarella, fontina and basil pizza (add mushrooms).
Cesar salad and bruschetta!
Yum!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm... I love their bruschetta.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  

We've tried a few of their different pizzas and salads.  My favorite salad has been the Chicken Spinach Apple salad, which is a close second to their bruschetta.  

The atmosphere is good, but nothing special."}
{"text":"got a mozzarella fontina and basil pizza tonight without red sauce with oil and it was like eating crackers and a little bit of flavor; not at all like pizza should be don't know if I'll try it again"}
{"text":"A good location if your spending the day shopping at Fashion Square and want a close place to grab a drink, good food, and sit outside! The Suprema and  a Stella are a good match. Grab one personal pizza for two and your good!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, decent prices, but the atmosphere is a bit cafeteria'ish.  The locations are great for us."}
{"text":"Went on Friday 12/9 for a late dinner and was very impressed with the location and the staff. Everyone was working hard and super friendly. The food was good as usually but the people that were working made the experience that much better. Keep it up"}
{"text":"Delicious, cheap food at the airport and very friendly staff.  I asked about the soups and the gentleman behind the register didn't hesitate to make a recommendation. I got the Tuscan Tomato which came with a piece of baguette and butter. Super creamy and super tasty. Took all of the stress out of my body and I got to sit and relax before my flight back to Vegas."}
{"text":"Grilled cheese panini and Tuscan tomato soup special was awesome. One of the better choices to eat at sky harbor."}
{"text":"For an airport restaurant location they should tell you if it will take long. Ordered 20 minutes ago. Daughter was served and finished meal before any hope of getting my pizza...hers was yummy?! :/"}
{"text":"Food was okay, cashier laughed at us when we ordered a glass of moscato. Fruit flies made it hard to hold on to our appetite although the manager and the expo runner were super friendly and awesome."}
{"text":"I ate here today with a dining companion while waiting for a flight.  

For our entrees we ended up splitting the feta turkey salad and chicken Caesar pizza.  The salad was nice with large chunks of turkey, plenty of feta and a variety of other toppings like almonds and tomatoes.  It also had a dressing that complimented the salad nicely being sweet but not too sweet.  The pizza ended up being an interesting creation with the pizza crust being cooked and then a chicken Caesar salad put on top.  It did not look pretty but tasted good.  The crispness of the crust underneath the salad was good as was the whole salad, especially the cheese shavings.  It's only drawback was how messy it was.

The bottom line for me is that I would eat here again while passing through the airport.  Just be aware of the time as these pizzas are not fast food."}
{"text":"I ordered the Chopped Italian through Door Dash today and I was anything but happy or impressed with it. There was to be smoked mozzarella on the salad, but on mine there was none. I asked for black olives (which they surprisingly didn't have) so I replaced that with green bell peppers but instead I got soggy and mushy red peppers. There were about 4 finely chopped pepperoni and sopressata slices in the salad, which really didn't make a difference because they were so finely chopped up. Just a very poor salad for paying $12 for it. If I could get my money back, I think I would give this place another try but since I ordered through Door Dash, I highly doubt it. What a shame."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for lunch when I was in town and it was a nice lunch time environment. I had the pasta and meatball dish and it was great! The meatballs were not the traditional Italian meat, but still wonderful. The lunch specials are no longer part of their menu which was a bit of a bummer. The staff was really nice and helpful considering this wasn't a full service restaurant. Really hoping they bring back the lunch specials though!"}
{"text":"Fantastic experience! The menu looks amazing , the restaurant casual , it is clean and open . I can't wait to come back and try a couple different pies . Tonight we had pepperoni pizza and rosemary potato pizza . Both were so great . The pizza crust is cracker thin and crispy . We both noticed that the pizzas weren't one bit greasy or heavy. Also , there is a 10% off coupon tied to Yelp just make sure you check in 1st so you can use it."}
{"text":"Came here on a Fri evening stood in line for 45 min and time to order they say we are out of red ssuce??? How can you run out of sauce at an Italian restaurant!  Unacceptable! !!"}
{"text":"This  is a great place to get a good pizza if you are at the airport.  After have tacos for 4 days in Phoenix, the pizza was great. The service was great too."}
{"text":"This place really disappointed us. Saw the reviews and was excited about the meal. Unfortunately, the salads are on par with something you would buy at Wal-Mart and the pizza was forgettable.

I usually never get upset about trying new places, but we truly felt cheated by Sauce. Our meal was around $24 for two people and that was about $24 overpriced.

Save yourself a headache and go to Fired Pie if you are looking for fast casual pizza."}
{"text":"Awsome service great food amazing people that work here!!! If you haven't already I recommend you try this place"}
{"text":"Waiting at terminal 4 at the airport on a Saturday eve and needed food.  Not even 9pm and everything was closed.  Strolled in here and a nice young man directed me to the to go case where I was able to get a \"butcher\" slice, a veg salad and a water.  Sat nearby at a charge station and thoroughly enjoyed my dinner."}
{"text":"While everybody mentions this for lunch, may I say Sauce in Chandler is a good place for families for dinner! We had gone there one evening and found the place reasonably full, with patrons. Not too noisy and nor uncomfortably quiet. 
The smells were awesome, and we saw the ovens going so opted to try the pizza which is what they are known for. Good choice as they were fresh and delish! I can't recall which ones we ordered but our take-out was just 1 slice from the 3 pizzas so let's just say they were enjoyed :D 
Yes we added the crushed red peppers - but then we add that to everything - but overall it was good! And we hope to get out there again!"}
{"text":"In all the times I've been to Sauce, I've never been disappointed. This afternoon I took my Italian friend (her Mom makes pizza from scratch) to Sauce for the second time. She even suggested going there! We split a thin crust cheese, mozzarella and basil pizza--we both thought the pizza was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! We sat on their outdoor patio and it was so peaceful that it felt like we were on vacation. Their \"thin\" crust is the thinnest I've ever seen, so not as many carbs or calories! The pizza tasted so fresh! Excellent quality!!! Friendly staff. Very unusual pizza menu to choose from, as well as, build your own. Their salads look amazing, too. They also serve wine and an assortment of beer. If you have never been to Sauce and you love fresh, excellent pizzas, do yourself a favor and don't delay--please check them out today!  Highly recommend Sauce to everyone!"}
{"text":"This is only getting one star because I can't add this review with any less. We stopped here starved before a fight out and found this establishment to be FAR DIFFERENT from the Sauces we had previously eaten at. We ordered a \"chicken sausage & polbano\" pizza. The chicken sausage was NO WHERE to be found!!! It must have been ground up to nothing where it was not visible or adding any flavor to this pizza. I decided I probably would have got more chicken sausage in a won ton! Ridiculous!!! I highly recommend you go anywhere else. And the management didn't have a clue on how to speak to customers. It was suggested that the menu describe the sausage as as not to mislead customers....she \"Amanda\" (I was told) just stood there with her mouth open. She is an absolutely useless excuse for management personnel. We will not be back! To this franchise specifically.......Sauces on Camelback is WONDERFUL!"}
{"text":"We we leaving for a trip to San Francisco in the late afternoon, so we decided to grab a bite to eat. We were pleasantly surprised to see this restaurant right across from Paradise Bakery in Terminal 4. They certainly are giving PB a run for their money.

Everything was almost the same as their other restaurant in Scottsdale. When our pizza came , the dough, was sitting in some of the sauce. I prefer the bottom of my pizza to be dry. 

We are not discouraged, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Typically when I have gone to Sauce, it has been before getting onto a flight at PHX.  This time, it was after dropping my sister off for her flight.  My family and I debated about where to go for dinner.  I have always enjoyed Sauce's pizzas.  This time was no exception, and we tried their bruschetta in addition to a few pizzas.  The bruschetta was a caprese bruschetta with large chunks of fresh mozzarella and tomatoes covered with a balsamic vinaigrette all of this on top of a thick piece of bread smothered with pesto sauce.  Yum!  I had the mozzarella, fontina, and basil pizza.  The rest of my party had something with a bunch of stuff on it.  I like variations of cheese pizza, so I didn't try theirs.  The pizzas are nice thin crust; the sauce is not overwhelming, and the flavors mix together well.  I haven't tried Sauce outside of Sky Harbor, but since places in Sky Harbor can't mark up the prices more than restaurants and stores outside; it's really nice."}
{"text":"I have picked up from sauce a number of times now. I love how professional and courteous they are here. They have treated me very well. I like how they present your order to you and the way they pack the to-go items is awesome! The food is beautiful and delicious."}
{"text":"its to pricy for the food you get. not a huge fan probably wouldn't try it again. I'd rather go to Fired Pie :/"}
{"text":"As I'd mentioned before about the lack of timing on entrees that should arrive at the same time, I'm pleased to say that they did arrive together during our most recent visit (today). Perhaps it's because we both got pasta instead of mixed entrees or perhaps it's because they took notice. Can't say for sure, but I'm happy it worked out. We'll see what happens from here forward.

Happy eating!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed everything about Sauce. My wife and I ate there for lunch on a Monday. The menu was fairly extensive but we were helped out by a very helpful employee. We got the tomato bruschetta, a regular pepperoni pizza with basil, and the chicken, spinach, and apple salad.  All three were excellent. They were brought out by the staff quickly and they made sure we were well taken care of. They checked on us at least 3 times while we were there to ensure everything was perfect. I have nothing but good things to say!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Have been going to sauce for years.  Have always ate the pizza and pasta.  I should have just stuck with tradition.  I ordered the Roast Beef and Smoked Mozzarella Panini.  It was awful.  I Didn't eat half of it.  It really had almost no flavor.  It was a completely odd experience eating a roast beef with no flavor.  I had my wife even try some of the meat and she was perplexed as well.  Also the meat was really cold and the mozzarella was cold and unmelted.  Kind of expected a panini to be warm.  I was wrong.  My wife had a grilled cheese and tomato soup. While the soup was good, the grilled cheese was also awful.  The cheese was nowhere close to being melted.   Like i said, lesson learned.  Stick to the pizza and pasta."}
{"text":"Far too thin crust. I don't feel the veges were particularly fresh. Don't think I would return"}
{"text":"Ok, especially for airport fare. Two chicken Caesar salads for just short of $20. Arrived quickly (on a Saturday), tasted good. Go there."}
{"text":"Brittini is amazing we love her !!!! Ouida and Terry great team work we love yoooouuuuu"}
{"text":"shitty customer service from miss lady in the braids 

I obviously didn't know how the menu worked and she knew I was confused and didn't bother to help me out and just stared at me as I sounded ridiculous trying to place my order!!! 

smile a little bit, lighten up, and plz help your customers. just because you hate your job does not mean you need to hate me!!


pizza looks pretty btw. could've been cooked a little longer but the prices for extra toppings just doesn't amount to what they put on the pizza. Probably won't b coming back"}
{"text":"I am not sure why I had never been to this Sauce before since it is fairly close to my home. But I went there a couple weeks ago with my sisters and it was a-ok. I am not a huge fan of their pizza but I do like their pasta and salads. I've eaten lunch a few times at the one in Scottsdale which I think is ridiculously slow but this Ocotillo location seems to have great service. I have a feeling I will return."}
{"text":"If I could give them zero stars I would. My wife called in an order for our family of 6 plus our 2 out of town guests. I arrived 30 min later to pick up said order and they can't find it. After talking to the manager they had the order under a different name, they didn't have ANY RED SAUCE for the pasta dishes we ordered AND they only had enough \"gluten free\" pasta for one of the two orders we needed to be gluten free. This has happened to us on at least 2 other occasions and I have tried to get my wife to stop ordering from here because it's ridiculous every time. I've never considered this as a dinning option since the first experience so I think I finally have my wife convinced to stop as well. 

The manager did offer me a free soda while I waited longer for our revised orders since they can't fulfill our ACTUAL orders. I mean, if you're called \"sauce\" shouldn't you have red sauce for your pasta dishes? By the way, it's 6:45pm on a Friday so you would think they would be prepared for a dinner crowd. 

My recommendation - go elsewhere. Make pasta on your own because the convenience is definitely lost on this place."}
{"text":"I ordered a Prosciutto & Fig pizza via Postmates. The pizza was supposed to have fresh arugula but it arrived cold, bland, and no arugula. I don't think I will be ordering from Sauce again."}
{"text":"This place was a hell of a lot better than I expected. I figured this place would be like all the other recent fast casual crappy places. First thing that stood out when I walked in was the amazing customer service. Everyone working there was very friendly and accommodating to us. When you order the pizza they actually go take the time to make it good and not with these nasty fast casual ingredients either. I was pleasantly surprised. The pizza was good. The price is pretty fair for what you get. The restaurant environment is pretty nice too. I am pretty picky about my pizza so I can't say I would keep going back constantly because we have too many better options around here. It is worth trying once at least though."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza with sausage, mushrooms & onions (favorite combo).  After extremely long wait with no one ahead of us, we received our pizza.  I took 1 bite of mine and could barely swallow it for the putrid taste of maybe rotted onion.  My wife struggled through a piece only to be sick in her stomach within 15 minutes.  When staff came by I told them the pizza was bad, so he asked me if I wanted a box to go, I said no it's really gross and he said, 'so no box?'.   We left, pizza missing 1 piece -$22 down the drain and an upset stomach."}
{"text":"Now this is a great place to catch a bite at the airport.. Yummy thin crust pizzas and fresh salads.. Not your typical airport pizza."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst pizza I have ever had.   Zero taste, paper thin pepperoni, cheese barley covered pizza, undercooked.   Complete waste of money"}
{"text":"Really tasty. Thin crust reminds me of pies you find in SoHo/NYC. Wood fired, crust edges are nicely singed. You stand in line to order, but they bring it to your table, so you can relax a bit. The size is larger than I expected for an airport pizza."}
{"text":"I've had both a breakfast pizza and a regular pizza (pepperoni) here and I liked them both and I thought the price was fairly reasonable. The nice thing is that that they have several wines on tap and a good selection of craft beers (though those are only in the bottle). Pizza crust tends to be crisp and thin and they do cook i in an actual wood fired oven. IN other words, not quite the calorie bomb one might expect and it tastes great. I will definitely go again next time I'm at the Phoenix airport."}
{"text":"My cousins are wild about this place. I'm not nearly as enthused.

Sauce specializes in ultra-thin pizzas with top-notch toppings, and it definitely delivers on its promise. Each 12\" pizza costs about $10 and awkwardly serves about 1.5 people. I could eat a whole one if I really tried, but half of one wouldn't be filling.

I can't say I dislike Sauce's pizzas, but I can't say they're great. I'd much rather grab a bite a few streets down at Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. Clean and comfortable space. Convenient location. Quick service. Friendly employees. Spacious dining area so you're not jammed up to the next table. Reasonable prices. What more could one want? There's really nothing more that one could (or should) ask for. Two thumbs up from this yelper!!!"}
{"text":"Our experience at this Sauce was a good one. Friendly service and tasty food is always a good combination! The ordering process was fast and efficient and our food came out pretty quickly. There is a self serve drinking station with a couple varieties of tea and sodas and of course water for those of us trying to do the right thing. The dining room itself could have used a little attention which is why I'm withholding a star, but it wasn't egregious and we still enjoyed our meal and the overall experience."}
{"text":"Not going to lie, this used to be my families favorite spot. A while back though the ownership of Sauce changed, back in 2015 or 2016 I believe. With the new owners pride has gone down, they have opened more, but the quality sucks. Prices are up, which is the trend these days with labor costs, but for what you get, it's not worth it.

Went here the other day for a date with my wife, she ordered pasta and I got a thin crust pizza. Her pasta came out as expected first, instead of just giving her the bread or roll the girl asked her as she held if she \"really\" wanted it. Like they are rationing them or something. Make matters worse it was not fresh nor did it seem like it had been cooked \"this week\" to be honest.

My pizza came out 20 minutes after the pasta, which is longer than normal. Taking one look at it, I realized why, they put it in the oven and forgot about it. Thin crust has never meant burnt and over crispy. It was cut but they cut the middle only because they knew it. The edges were blackened and not in a good way, puffed up and crunchy. When I would grab for a piece the first 2 inches would just crumble away leaving me with a little bit of toppings and crus to eat the middle of the pizza. 

Service is gone too, they came by asked if we needed a box this was before my pizza arrived. My wife said yes, the box arrived as we were ready to leave. Not once were we asked how we were doing, how the food was, or anything. 

This used to be a \"star\" of the downtown Ocotilo area and has become a one and done place now. I am glad we used a gift card we received to pay for this meal, although I still feel bad because the person who bought it for us expected more.

This experience has been the same time and time again for the last year. I keep thinking \"oh it will get better\" and it continues to decline. Very disappointed, I've learned that it's not going to get better."}
{"text":"I've been eating here since they opened and can't get enough. Very fun pizza toppings (potatoes and other unique veggies), and the arugula pizza is the best. I also love the Mac n cheese and salads."}
{"text":"I've now eaten at a few Sauce locations and every experiance has been very positive. I really enjoyed the airport location because I travel a lot and have found often times you don't find good food at airports. The food came out quick which is great when you have a flight to catch. They boxed it up for me nicely which made it easy for my to take leftovers onto the plane if I wanted.

 I've tried a few of the pastas and they are all great, my fav is the Chicken & broccoli pasta, delicious. Sauce has also help me find a new favorite wine, Snoqualmie, which is difficult because I am so picky when it comes to my wine. Has to be sweet and fruity. Cheers to you Sauce !!"}
{"text":"The service was prompt, the food great and the price even better. I always dread airport eating because food is subpar and the price is always outrageous. Sauce has been the exception to that stereotype. I actually look forward to flying out of terminal 4 at PHX because I look forward to eating here"}
{"text":"While their food is good, I'm sick of always waiting.... they consistently take 15-20 minutes PAST the time they say your order will be ready. They are SO SLOW. So either adjust your times so that I don't show up 20 minutes early or hire some more people to help out."}
{"text":"Love this place for a Sunday afternoon pizza and glass of wine! I had the prosciutto and fig pizza with a can of Rose' the perfect combination in my opinion. My only advise would be to try something different. You can make pepperoni pizza at home. Yummm!"}
{"text":"Potentially the best airport food I have ever had! My husband and I were taking a late flight home from AZ and stopped for dinner before boarding. The pizza pie was legit! Quick, affordable and yummy - a surprise coming from an airport! Well done."}
{"text":"I needed a drink so I came here. Service was ok nothing great. Hell the guy was not even happy to be there. Seemed lost really. Drinks are always high priced at the airport but what can you do. food was just ok not even good. 

Over all food was not good and service not at all what it could be. I wont come here again."}
{"text":"Probably the only airport meal I've ever had that I would actually purchase if I wasn't at an airport. Partly due to the light and airy crust I was able to finish a whole pizza in about 10 minutes flat which is often all the time you have before you catch a flight. Plenty of seating, competitive prices and super quick service mean that I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"Excellent service and very fast! Always pleased with my meals here. Chicken, Broccoli and cheese sauce is my personal favorite. The chicken Cesar salad pizza is great too!"}
{"text":"Tried most everything on the Menu and haven't found a dish I do not like. The chicken Caesar pizza is a standout as well as the macaroni and cheese. The pricing is also really good considering the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Our favorite go-to quick restaurant. The food is always delicious, fresh, and consistent. The staff is very friendly and it's a very clean restaurant. I love the chicken pine nut salad, Mac n cheese, and all the pizzas"}
{"text":"Where else at the airport can you get a pepperoni mushroom pizza for about 975 plus tax it was quick and delicious and the staff was very friendly and currently they still honor Fox restaurant concept gift cards even though Fox sold this chain off"}
{"text":"The bruschetta is amazing! It's not the typical toasted thin bread- This is thick, warm and soft- with large chunks of tomatoes, and mozzarella cheese- with a flavorful pesto spread...I also ordered the seasonal salad which was equally as amazing! The place is casual but perfect for lunch or dinner with a wonderful atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Good place for some Italian food! I love the pizza and the pastas here! You can't go wrong with the Mac n cheese option here! It's actually one of my faves! 

The latest time I came here we enjoyed a nice pizza and bruschetta. There are definitely some more fancy Italian places that can serve better food, but the convenience of this place is what makes it a go-to option that will satisfy you."}
{"text":"We go here all the time we love their pizza and salads. It is one of our go to spots when we do not feel like cooking. THey are great! My son loves the Mac & Cheese! The pizza is thin crust and crispy!"}
{"text":"I'm very dissatisfied with Sauce. I have ordered their pizza more than 3 times. There's a bad synthetic or burned taste to it, it may be the cheese. The middle of the pizza is consistently undercooked. I have tried ordering the pizza to be crispier, but they can't seem to dial in the temperature if their oven. Their salads are good."}
{"text":"I mean, the pizza is amazing and the tea is good. Salads and sandwiches are also excellent. Literally always an excellent choice. In fact, writing this review has me wanting to eat there now."}
{"text":"Airport food...stale, over priced under served, right? Well, this place is a real treat. From the cold beer to the ceasar salad to the fresh hot pizza this never ending succession of impression is capped off by fantastic service (seat yourself seating brings tips under question, but these folks hustle the food out hot with a smile).  I'm a bit of a ceasar snob, yet the chilled lettuce, light dressing with just the right bite, plenty of Parmesan, and fresh made croutons won me over and then some.  And an entre size salad for $6 was very impressive! As was the $8 pizza thin crust with fresh basil (I've had smaller pies for twice that price!).  I think I may fly the family out next time just to eat here!"}
{"text":"The first Fox Restaurant Concepts restaurant I've been to. 
Friend and I enjoyed the pizza and wine deal for $10? I believe.
I remember their sangria being really delicious but didn't really enjoy the fact that they had you pay/order at the front before being seated. Being a pizza restaurant and all, this aspect of the restaurant classed it down a lot."}
{"text":"Swinging through the airport and this place caught my eye.     The service was amazing.   The whole staff was working hard and walking around hustling.    I was so impressed with my pizza.  Just a plain pepperoni bit it was awesome and hit the spot.   Side salad was good.     Wished I had this sauce pizza by me."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant, great salads and sandwiches!  
This is one of my favorites restaurants in all of AZ.. The Arugula salad is so delicious, plus I am a fan of their turkey panini.  Please come to Casa Grande!
We are so limited here in variety of healthy dining!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, all smiles while waiting for my flight :) tried Mac & cheese and a sausage & caramelized onion pizza- both amazing for the price!"}
{"text":"Hair in food... Never going back....
Called in for a pickup order and the girl could not even take down my info. without me having to repeat myself multiple times, and then while eating the chicken broccoli pasta I food a hair!"}
{"text":"Our entire family was transiting from Mexico back to CA at PHX.  
We were hungry and tired.  
We made the wise choice by walking into this gourmet pizza place!

It was the BEST thin crust pizzas I ever had!  
The chicken sausage and poblano was my favorite.  I had to order a second one!  
We also had pepperoni & mushroom, sausage & pepperoni, and cheese pizza.  

We cleaned plates! Don't miss this place if you are in PHX!"}
{"text":"Definitely above average airport food! My girlfriend and I stopped at sauce because our flight got delayed and we were starving! We shared a pizza... Next time we won't share a pizza because I was still hungry! We also got a side of calamari which was much better than expected. I plan on trying sauce when I'm not at the airport because I was so impressed!"}
{"text":"The exploration of our new area continues.  I was intrigued by Sauce when I looked it up on the internet.  Although I'm not a fan of restaurant corporations, Fox seems to be trying some different things so I can respect that.  

Upon on entering, I checked out the menu on the wall and tried to make a decision.  Everything sounded good.  My daughter, on the other hand, found her favorite thing right away and was ready to order. Plain spagehtti with butter for her, I got a salad, pizza, and a glass of wine.  We sat down and my salad was served promptly.  I ordered the caprese salad.  YUM!!!  This was not your average caprese.  A lovely bowl of greens with chopped tomatoes and hunks of mozerella in a lovely balsamic vinegrette.  It was one of the best salads I have had in a long time!!  My daughter's dinner came to her in a few minutes, just the way she likes it.  She ate almost every bite.  A little ciabitta like roll came with my salad and her dinner.  It was tender and warm and the butter melted nicely on it.  Now for the pizza......this pizza is different than any I have had before.  I think it may grow on me.  The crust is like a cracker crust.  It has a nice flavor to it.  I'm still not sure if I like the fact that it's so thin it does not really stand up with the toppings.  Cheese is pretty weighty and even thin crust New York style can hold it.  This crust, although I did like it, was just a bit soggy from the cheese.  I had sausage, pepperoni and mushroom.  The flavors were all good.  Granted I have only been once so I do need to try it again and I think it will grow on me but it's not my norm so I'm unsure right now.  The salad was awesome thought and I will go back for that!  And my daughter was happy with her dinner too.  Sauce is close by so it will probably become one of our regular spots."}
{"text":"We get to the airport just a little earlier than normal so we can grab a pizza at Sauce. Thin, crispy wood fired pizza with great flavor no matter which kind you order. The service is quick and they are very friendly."}
{"text":"Very mediocre food. Basically it's a cafeteria where have to go up and order the food and they bring it to you. I had an artisan pizza with 2 toppings for $12 each topping was $1:50 but the lady next to me had one topping and seemed to have more with that one topping than I had with 2 toppings. The girl at the check out I asked her 6 times about the PASTA and she kept talking about pesto telling me it was made of oregano and nuts. My pizza toppings were only on the inner third of the pizza(I gave up on the pasta) the outer and Much larger 2/3rds had nothing on it but olive oil. One lady had salad and said her piece of roll was very hard and stale. 
Not a place I would return too."}
{"text":"good place to grab a nice sit down lunch. order at the counter and food is brought to you. wine beer. pasta. good thin crust pizza. nice salads. kids menu. some outdoor seating to enjoy the great weather"}
{"text":"This location is IMPECCABLE. We have been coming to other Sauce locations in the past and all have been great, but this one is even better. They honored a coupon that excluded their location, and made a full bowl of a new dish they wanted us to try. All employees were incredibly talkative and personable. Highly recommend this place to all!"}
{"text":"Wow!  A restaurant I'd be delighted to revisit even if it weren't in an airport. Excellent GF pizza base and good toppings. Recommended."}
{"text":"5 stars earned!
I didn't think I would've ever liked onion as a featured topping on a pizza but the sausage and onion pizza was one of the best pizzas I've ever had, even if the sausage wasn't on there ...

& I'm a meat-a-tarian!)... 

The flavor was on the savory, rich & a hint of sweet side. 
Oh, & the salad was very good (even for me, the aforementioned meat-a-tarian).  It wasn't drenched by dressing & the flavor wasn't just dressing but from the good ingredients (which the dressing brought out)

Aaand!!! 
This is how accommodating and great the staff were... I was looking for a specific NFL game to watch and the restaurant next-door said that there would be no chance that game would be on anywhere in the airport... I simply asked if Sauce could look for the game & voila!! 

Definitely returning."}
{"text":"I have to say ... What a great deal for a Friday afternoon (although) it's not limited to this.  But they offered some great value for a pizza, salad, and 2 glasses of wine ... And I could choose whatever I wanted!  And the service was top notch and I was very satisfied with Sauce pizza/Wine ... GO THERE ... You won't be disappointed!

And my server was the best ... She knew when I was ready for my next glass of wine and brought it right out to me ... With a smile and was totally awesome!  Her name was Ouida!

Thank you Sauce for the great service and even better food.

(I can't really say the same for US Air and American)"}
{"text":"The service was great we went here for a work lunch it was very busy. The food was not spectacular but ok. The ambiance was good. I had the meatballs and pasta and the pasta was overcooked but the sauce was good. It was like pasta fast food . Im use to the mom and pop places or non chain restaurants."}
{"text":"editing my review:

Made it to sauce on my return trip, which was exciting but I'm certainly not giving any stars back. The two cashiers were absolutely useless and a huge sanitation violation! One was eating in/on the food prep area while socializing with the other cashier. Then when she went to actually go do something, she didn't wash her hands and flung her ponytail all over the clean utensils she was putting away. Someone needs to give her a sanitation refresher. Ew.....


SO DISAPPOINTED!

When I fly I come through Phoenix JUST for Sauce. Literally. Flight came in at 9pm. Sauce says they're open till 11pm and they had completely shut down their kitchen. They didn't even have hot food left in the to go section. What a HUGE disappointment. Poor management too. They should make their hours more accurate or not be completely out of food 2 hours before they close."}
{"text":"Great chicken, pine nut, Gorgonzola salad with red wine vinaigrette! Thanks Sauce crew!!"}
{"text":"While waiting for a plane at Sky Harbor airport and hungry for something to hold us over until we got to our final destination (don't you hate to hear the word \"final\" just as you're ready to get on a plane?) we passed up the opportunity to eat at the typical fast food places and wandered in to Sauce.

Neither of us had ever heard of it and assumed it was a one-location place because of the custom look to the décor. The employees also did not look or act like chain restaurant employees. For the most part take that as a compliment however it was a bit unnerving to see the burly security man hovering nearby. Not a good feeling while you're trying to eat lunch.

Well apparently there are 10 Sauce locations, which doesn't exactly make them a chain, especially since they are all located in Arizona.

One of the things that makes Sauce a 5-star experience is that, contrary to all logic about how human greed should work, they don't gauge their captive patrons with ridiculously inflated \"airport prices\", in fact their prices may be called cheap. And their portions are large, almost too large considering 99% of their customers can't easily take a doggie bag of Italian food on an airplane.

As far as quality, it's not only good, it's surprisingly good whether you factor in that its airport food or not. The pizza is head and shoulders better than that pretentious tourist trap that mysteriously always seems to have some out-of-town reporter claiming that it's the \"best pizza in the known world\" (ps - it's not).

This will probably be my go-to place at Sky Harbor from now on. They even serve breakfast. How can you lose?"}
{"text":"Good food. Over priced. Not so much worth the money but continues to find myself going back."}
{"text":"Sauce is consistent. It doesn't matter which location you go to. They are always on point and high quality. I'm a fan and will always go to any Sauce I can find. This one is as good as any other. Here's my secret order. Get the cheese pizza with fontina. It's like a margherita pizza. After the pizza is ready and they've sliced it, have them add sliced avocado to the top of the pie. You'll love it."}
{"text":"I had to wait for my luggage which was comming on the next flight. I decided to get a pizza. Not a good chice though. I havnt been to sauce before not sure if just the airport kocation is bad like this or all of them.
1) the lady back there preparig pizza didnt have gloves on. Grabbing cheese and toping bare hand and spread them on the dough.
2) pizza was extremely salty. Maybe thats how they sell drink!!!!
3) they are stingy with the cheese and topping
For 11$ pizza i expect to have good amount of topping
4) overall pizza didn't look or taste good. I eat it because didnt want to go to another resturant and pay another 11$. Anywhere else i wouldnt even eat it.
Id compare their pizza with 7/11 pizza."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good! I came here as many people had great things to say about it. The first time I was here I got the pizza and that was very light but tasty and the next time, I got the Mac n Cheese which was pretty okay, it was kinda like Panera in terms of taste. Overall it is a pleasant place to eat, nothing to rave about but good. Their cookie pizza is really good, just takes a while to make since it comes out fresh."}
{"text":"The only time I go to Sauce is for group lunches since we work at Intel right down the street. Chill counter service but it's not the best pizza in the world but it's decent. The mushroom pizza is VERY mushroom-y which is good and I do favor more thin crust pizzas. My salads (salmon & arugula) have been hit or miss. The salmon piece varies is seasoned well one time but then not the next. One time a pizza came out for my friend before my salad. It's always packed for lunch but since it's just an average lunch spot for us it doesn't make me want to go for dinner."}
{"text":"I got stuck at the Phoenix Airport a few weeks ago for SEVEN HOURS!! It was horrible. The only thing that saved me from insanity was Sauce's fantastic red wine and pizza menu. There's no better way to kill a day at the airport than by getting tipsy on wine with perfect strangers. They have a super classy menu that is shockingly affordable for an airport. I had this great artichoke, olive, and portabella mushroom pizza, handmade and cooked in a beautiful, old-world stone oven right in front of me... at an airport! The restaurant is decorated in a very modern and trendy style. Like something you'd see in downtown Portland, not in Phoenix and especially not at an airport. If you're ever stuck at PHX, eat here."}
{"text":"Sauce used to be good (as a whole), not just this store.   They recently changed a few of their recipes such as the vegetable to minestrone soup, the types of noodles in the mac and cheese, etc.  They now lack flavor.  Especially if you show up early lunch time when they open, the soups have not cooked long enough and the vegetables are hard as a rock! I love their pizza, might just stick with that from here onwards.  The champagne vinaigrette is also good on the mixed green salad."}
{"text":"The quality of the food here is pretty consistent and good BUT the last few trips to Sauce in Chandler have produced meals that are barely warm and the portion size has shrunk to the size of a kids meal. :(  Unfortunately, tonight we had to send two meals back - both were lukewarm at best."}
{"text":"This place is exceptional for a quick airport restaurant. It's open to the central food court in terminal 4 right next to the higher end Chelsea's Kitchen. 

You walk up and order at the window - they have chalkboards flanking you with the current menu. The prices are extremely reasonable, and the quality is high by pizzeria standards, but  exceptional for airport food. 

The service is great, and we even had a waitress ask us if you wanted anything else, then she grabbed our card, took it up front, ran it, and brought us our food, though this didn't seem like standard procedure.

Tends to get pretty crowded at peak travel times, but we've always managed to find a table within a reasonable amount of time (first come first serve).

My coworkers and I have made this our regular hangout spot before flying out of a client in Phoenix, and it's likely to stay a staple."}
{"text":"Yay!  They have opened, and they are close to my work.  I had an arugula salad with chicken, and it was excellent.  They had a nice patio to sit on that was less noisy than inside.  Good customer service.  I was not feeling well that day, and the staff was nice to me.  I was getting a migraine and probably looked like I was going to die.  I look forward to coming back.  I also hope they get their online ordering up and running because I will definately use that."}
{"text":"I was at the phoenix airport trying to catch a flight to Oregon....needles to say i wanted try Sauce's pizza....i love pizza.

The establishment is very nice. Customer service is great....so great points. I tried their pepperoni and sausage pizza with onions and peppers. This style of pizza is brick oven style, thin sliced. It was not bad, but not the best. They seem to have a good wine collection and other food items (other than pizza).  The pizza itself is 12 inches and not too greasy. I ate the whole pizza without being too full. This is G approved but i should try again next time."}
{"text":"Got to the airport early and decided to have some food before going thru security.  So surprised at this find and the pizza was great.   Good Options for those of you who are vegetarian and a great place to grab some food.  My husband and I shared a pizza and had plenty."}
{"text":"I travel a little more these days and every time I do, I go to the airport early to stop here. Not only is the food and service great, but they also have \"reasonably\" priced beer and wine (I know right, at the airport?!!). Who knew? 
Thank goodness we have Yelp to alert those savvy travelers.
The only down side is you have to go out of the \"TSA secure area\" to enjoy Sauce, which means anyone here on a layover is missing out...

PS. It's in terminal 4."}
{"text":"Worth almost missing my flight for this pizza. Embarrassing to show up LATE with steaming hot pizza. OOPS.
Take-out  box goes through security in one of those little buckets just fine. Box and awesome THIN style pizza both held up to 1,000 yard dash to the gate in great shape. Also had tiramisu (in the life's short, eat dessert first vain) while waiting for the pizza to cook and it was excellent. Friends caprisi (sp) salad was superb also."}
{"text":"I had such a bad experience with Sauce in Scottsdale that I crossed them off my list for good, telling everyone I know to avoid all Sauce locations. But at a girlfriend's request, we met up at Sauce in Chandler one Sunday afternoon.

Night and day between locations!

The line was long. When I got up to the front, I understood why. The cashiers were so sweet and took their time with each guest, rather than just punching in orders. I was up for pizza, but didn't really see one that caught my attention. The young man asked me what I liked and put together a special white-sauce-chickeny pizza just for me! I ordered a beer too and sat myself out on the patio while I waited for my friend.

A couple girls came over to check on us several times. While it is a fast-casual type of restaurant, the servers that walk around can still get you another beer or glass of wine. Just ask!

After some girl chat and several beers, one of the servers mentioned dessert. She had me at chocolate. I ordered this Nutella-mousse chocolate layered thingie. Can't tell you what it was, but I can tell you that if heaven were a dessert, it would be this!

Beautiful location, stunning patio and sweet staff (don't forget to tip them!) 

Five stars!"}
{"text":"I was happy to find a 4-5 star place to grab a quick dinner in PHX Sky Harbor airport terminal 4.

Sauce appears to have locations in Phoenix outside the airport as well.  I appreciated the thoughtful toppings and ordered a fajita chicken and poblano pizza.  It was a great and quick pizza.  However, several aspects, notably the crust keep it out of the 4 and 5 star rating for me.  

A fine place to eat when you're in the airport, but hard to score as a 4 star experience."}
{"text":"I went here on my way to Hawaii. Here's the deal. This place has awesome breakfast sandwiches. They are way better than anything else you can get in the airport for breakfast at the current time. I had an egg sandwich on pizza crust....it was excellent! I liked that it was cooked by a person in a pan (although I did see all of their 'sauce's coming out of plastic bags for later in the day.....not so awesome, but what can I expect?). The pizza crust made for a tasty spin on this classic sandwich. It also had cheese and tomato. It came with italian home fries, which were delicious! They had garlic and parm on them...Seriously? What more can you ask for...especially in an airport!"}
{"text":"I wanted a quick eat but not a whole pizza so went for the pesto bruschetta. It was absolutely delicious. Quick, efficient service which is naturally what's needed at the airport. A great price too which means I will be back next time I fly. 
Nice work Sauce
."}
{"text":"I expected a lot from this place. Everyone in my group raved about it, and I got excited as I saw how delicious their plates looked. My own food came, and it looked and smelled amazing. I was excited to start the meal.

However, the pizza was missing... something. The flavors just didn't pop. I put some peppers and cheese on it, but it was still just edible. They did that thing where they put extra flour on the crust to make it seem more \"fresh\", but I think it muted the flavors even more.

The mac and cheese was also lacking flavor, which was really disappointing. Everyone ate happily and loved their food, and I'm sure that my meal was just the one bad meal in the bunch. For that, I'll give sauce a 2nd star. Still, for 13 bucks, I was quite disappointed."}
{"text":"Sauce: Need to update description of salads. A chopped salad is not a minced salad. Very disappointing to anticipate freshly chopped salad in bite-sized pieces only to find chopped at Sauce is about two degrees shy of pesto.  Great dressings, but you need to ease up on the mince and go for bite-sized chop."}
{"text":"I love Sauce. I used to come here at least once a week for lunch. When I come with my husband he usually orders the pepperoni and crimini mushroom pizza. He likes it a lot and I'm just whatever about it. The crust is thin and limp and the pizza is oily but the flavor is there and they don't skimp on the mushrooms. I usually order the tomato concasse bruschetta and a half order of pasta and meatballs but I've switched it up before and ordered their meatball and mozzarella panini and the chicken, broccoli, and cheese sauce pasta. The first time we came here my husband had the Italian panini and he was super disappointed, he wasn't a fan of the bread , said sandwich was a little dry, and I know he would have preferred fries instead of the chips that their sandwiches comes with but that's more his issue than theirs, lol. The meatball and mozzarella panini was good, it was really hearty and came with an entire bowl of red sauce which I thought was tomato soup and was eating with a spoon because of course I would. I only managed to finish half and then left the other half in the fridge at work and it reheated just fine in the microwave. I was in shock, lol. I was expecting a soggy mess but Sauce held me down. The tomato bruschetta is great; I can't believe it's only $5. It's definitely my favorite thing on the menu. I will say thought that I'm not a fan of the chicken in their chicken and broccoli pasta, it's like pulled or shredded chicken which I don't really like and the flavor of the chicken didn't go well with the flavor of the cheese. It was a miss for me. And their strawberry basil lemonade, oh boy, absolutely never again, it was a savory drink and I was not ready. Also, their cannoli was just okay, I wouldn't try it again but I am looking forward to trying their gelatos. The flavors change often so you have to ask when you get there what they're serving that day. Overall, other than the few items on the menu that I wasn't feeling, my go-to items are always great and the service is always fast and friendly. Remember to check in on Yelp to receive 10% off!"}
{"text":"turkey and fontina panini had a light pesto mayo sauce that did not over power the turkey, lettuce and tomatos. Nice crisp bread and chips on the side made for a great light meal before flying out

Other possible options are pasta and pizza."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices for an airport restaurant. I ordered the basic mozzarella, fontina, and basil pizza, because if you can't make a good cheese pizza you should not be called a pizza restaurant. The pizza came out really hot. The thin crust was slightly crispy with a little char around the edges from the wood fired oven, which I happen to like. The fontina cheese was a great addition to a traditional margarita pizza, and it added a nice nutty flavor. The service was quick, friendly, and attentive. Overall a good meal at the newest terminal in Sky Harbor. Now to go catch my plane!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Sauce and it was pretty darn good. Located in terminal 4 in the midst of all of the shops and casual eateries. I believe this might be the only place serving alcohol without having to go through the gates. We ate here while waiting for my daughter's flight to come in and decided to take advantage of their $20 deal: 2 glasses of wine, a salad, and a pizza. The salad had chicken, sunflower seeds, gorgonzola, and a vinagrette. The pizza had pepperoni. Everything was really good...the pizza crust was great. The service was good, too. This is a great dining option in the airport."}
{"text":"Far better than the typical airport dining experience, friendly service and excellent food!"}
{"text":"I had Turkey and feta salad with tomato soup. It was delicious and listed as gluten free (it comes with a roll in a bag, though.) Fast service and a great alternative to Chelsea's. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing. First time visitor. We ordered a 16\" pie with pepperoni and mushrooms, chicken/pine nut salad and an order or lasagna. The pizza dough was great, light and tasty. The salad was tasty, but the lasagna was phenomenal. Best lasagna I've hard in decades. Thanks for putting the extra sauce on the side for take out reasons. Looking forward to our next visit. Thanks."}
{"text":"I like the food but the service sucks.  They never serve a table at one time always liecemeal.  Half the time at least one party at the table gets something a half hour after everyone else.  They blame catering or take out orders.  Anything but take responsibility themselves."}
{"text":"Pizza with sausage and pepperoni was delicious as well as their Pinot Grigio. Perfect place to grab a bite when you have time before your fight.  Also I got my food pretty quick. *Note this restaurant is outside the security."}
{"text":"Gluten Free Crust was deelicious. I'll have a layover in the Phoenix airport anytime if I can get another pizza."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this location of Sauce twice now, and I have to say I am not impressed.

The first time I ate here I had nearly the same impression as I did on today's visit.  It was just okay.

The Good: The tomato soup is consistently yummy.  I mean, you can't really go wrong with tomato soup, but this is pretty addictive.

The homemade chips are also pretty good, but it feels like they have too much cheese on them somehow... and I don't even really taste cheese.  Weird!

The restaurant is cute enough.  And it looks like their pizzas are yummy.  I believe they even have a pizza and wine deal some nights.  Fun!

The Blah: The turkey and fontina panini is BORRRRINNNNNG.  Yes, it has pesto on it.  But the pesto is virtually tasteless (or, at least, it was today).  The panini also tasted like plain white bread.  Also, I was not expecting shredded lettuce (soggy and some leaves were brown) and tomato (light red... yuck).

The Ugly: On today's visit, our ticket was closed out before all the food was delivered.  That means DH got his sandwich 10 -15 minutes before DD.  And he was finished before we finally figured out they forgot about my sandwich completely.  We went up to the host stand and she looked into it and went through at least twelve tickets before she found ours.  I had my sandwich 3 minutes after that.  She flatly said \"Sorry,\" but did not offer to get a manager or do ANYTHING for us.  
We were running late so we just left.  

For just under $25, the price was a little high for the small portions of mediocre food.  Will I return?  Possibly... just to try the pizza.  But someone needs to step up their game because no wait staff even asked how we were doing the entire time we were there.  Had they done so, we could have told them we were missing our food.

An aside... I hate when restaurants don't time the food to arrive at the same or nearly the same time.  It is really awkward to have to choose to have someone at the table let their food get cold as they wait for their dining companions' food to come out.  Both times I dined at Sauce, our food was delivered several minutes apart (or longer, in today's snafu)."}
