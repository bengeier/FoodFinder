{"text":"The downtown location is one of my faves for lunch. It can be healthy if you want it to be, too. Lots of choices and reasonably priced. No seating. Their baba ghanoush was nice and smoky, yum yum! Also, their hours are not firm; I've gone a few times when they were supposed to be still open and they weren't."}
{"text":"My fiancé has been raving about the amazing food and service here, so I decided I needed to give it a try. The woman that worked there was so incredibly nice and helpful! I told her I had never been there before and she gave me recommendations of what to try and I'm so thankful for that! Everything she recommended was absolutely delicious and I am already excited to go back. The food is so flavorful and they have so many options that you'll be sure to leave there full and happy!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent service. Good prices. You can't go wrong with lunch here. I almost always get the wraps though. Gyro meat/chicken mixed with both sauces. Comes with a little side salad that is also very good."}
{"text":"The owner is hilarious and the food will impress you, even if you're a huge Mediterranean cuisine aficionado (like I am.) Place is small and might be off-putting to more fancy-pants eaters, but I'm going to bet that you can't get fresher, more delicious Turkish food anywhere else in this town. But what do I know, I was just visiting."}
{"text":"How do I love Josh + Susan? Let me count the ways! I feel incredibly lucky to work just across the street from Istanbul Grille. Fresh, delicious food. And it's not the same old stuff you see everywhere else. Josh is a master at preparing quality menus. The chicken is insane. Hands-down it's the most delicious chicken ever. And I've never met a side I didn't like. I even eat a paleo diet, and have never had a problem finding plenty to eat here...that's not easy to do elsewhere! 

Josh is warm and friendly, playfully flirting with his customers. And it works! I keep coming back, and sometimes I make plans in my head for us to run away together and he can feed me for the rest of time. :P  Even Susan has gotten in on his playfulness with the customers. The two of them together = dinner and a show!

The way they run the business is top-notch. I've never left hungry, they are so super generous. And there have been many times I didn't have cash on me, and they've given me food anyway. I always pay them back. :)  They clearly care about their customers, they recognize and acknowledge their regulars, and enthusiastically embrace and welcome new customers, often showering them with free sides to introduce the variety of food they serve.

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to design \"i love josh\" shirts. :)"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! and the owner Josh is a very nice guy. Don't come here on your lunch break if you are in a hurry. You make yourself look stupid huffing and puffing because we all know the food is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I visited today purely on the basis of yelp and newspaper reviews- so very happy I went.  Food is delicious, and the 2 women who were working today were very lovely.  Honestly, I'm scheduling time off of work to take my wife down there to eat. I even started to think it might not be so bad to have a job downtown again- such is the power of the place!"}
{"text":"Jeeeesuuuus....is this place good! I don't have very many regrets in life, but if I had to pick one it would be that I didn't believe my wife when she told me months ago how excellent the food at Istanbul Grille was. 

In fact, it wasn't until I found out they were being forced to close that I stared eating here. Since then, I've made several trips. Usually I end up with the chicken dish, salad with hot dressing, and a bunch of other stuff that I just kind of point at and they shovel into my Styrofoam to go box. 

I'm never 100% sure what I'm going to pay either, or if I'll get some extras, but I do know I haven't left spending over $10 or without a sore shoulder from carrying the enormous portions the provide.

If you haven't checked out Istanbul Grille, do yourself a favor and get down there before they're gone...also, let's say a prayer that when they are forced out, we find a new location for them close by."}
{"text":"great lunch spot (only open for lunch actually).  super fast, never actually seen an actual menu there.  you kind of just point and ask what they have and order.  fyi it's cash only.

there's the typical gyro and chicken platters with salad.  and they usually have different dish specials.  usual cost for a plate is $8.50.  they have a pretty large selection of different meze (appetizer), but never tried any as the entree platters are a decent sized portion for lunch.

definitely try the eggplant/lamb dish if they have it."}
{"text":"Excellent food, just be aware those with a sensitive stomach. The staff are always interesting and quick to greet you. My favorite meal so far has been the lamb gyros. As others have said cash only. Worth a shot for lunch with large portions and a unique meal."}
{"text":"Amazing little place! The food is so good, and I don't know how they fit so many different foods into their tiny little place. There are three main meal options, which include salad, your choice of protein (meat or vegetarian), and either white rice or bulgur. You can add on as many side dishes as you want, and the price goes up by a dollar or so, depending on how many side dishes you get. 

The first time I went there, I went on a friend's recommendation. I didn't know what a lot of the side dishes were, so they gave me a ton of them to sample FOR FREE. 

Everything I've had there has been excellent. I always get the chicken. I have no idea what seasoning they use, but the meat is delicious, tender, and flavorful. The bulgur is cooked perfectly. As for the sides, get the creamed shredded beets. You won't regret it. 

This place is cash only. Bring some singles to tip them."}
{"text":"I work in the Steel Tower and had never been to this place prior to them moving here. I never considered trying it until coworkers started raving about it. The owners are amazing and the food is fresh. The first time I was there, I had no idea what to order so the girl working the counter helped me out and gave me anything I wanted to try. The next time I came back, the owner, I think his name is Josh, gave my coworker and I a free slice of cheesecake. They are just the epitome of customer service. And you will definitely not go hungry. They pack the boxes so full that it's impossible to eat the whole thing. They have the best hummus I've ever tasted and I highly recommend the chickpea salad, the lentils, meatballs, and the baba ganoush. I''ve been wanting to try the chicken, but they haven't had it either time I've been there. I'll definitely be back so I'm sure I'll get to it!"}
{"text":"Great food!  For $9 I received bulgar, three vegetables of my choosing, and salad. Since I was a first time customer she added some beets, babaganush, and chick peas to try FREE!  I also added dolmas, which were the best I ever had."}
{"text":"this is my favorite lunch place downtown - tasty food, generous portions, friendly service and fair prices.  i always get the meat plate with varying sides.  the carrot salad is a standout.  it's true that you have to get there early when there's a line because they run out of food fast!"}
{"text":"Note that the Craig St. address is incorrect.  The restaurant has moved to 5501 Centre Ave., in Shadyside. This wonderful little hole-in-the-wall Turkish restaurant recently moved from Craig St. to Centre Ave (corner of N. Graham, across from the Giant Eagle).  The middle eastern food is wonderful and reasonably priced. Everything is prepared fresh from scratch. I've tried a variety of the menu items and all were delicious.  For lunch, the falafel, kofte or Adana sandwiches are delicious and cheap.   For entree, I especially like the Adana Kebabs - deliciously spicy ground lamb or chicken grilled on skewers and the vegetarian Zucchini Pancakes,crispy on the outside and warm and fluffy inside, served with homemade yogurt sauce.  The hummus is some of the best around and the baklava is to die for - the friendly and helpful owner, a native of Turkey, claims it's the best in the world and I think he may be right.  Turkish travel books, backgammon sets for companionable time spent with friends, and Turkish decor make the place unique and homey. 
The only drawback is that it's BYOB; of course this isn't considered a drawback by many people, as bringing your own is considerably less expensive. The owner has looked into getting a liquor license but it seems unlikely as it is next to a Methodist church. 
 A favorite with our family."}
{"text":"After moving up to Pittsburgh, I was worried I wasn't going to find any good food at all.  Especially to satisfy my newly acquired taste for Mediterranean food.  Luckily enough Istanbul Grille opened up right across the street from me, and I have been eating there at least twice a week for the past 8months, minus the time I go home for break. 

The food is amazing, everything is fresh, even down to the yogurt used in the sauces and certain dishes.  The baklava is the best I have ever had, my family tells me bring home at least 2 dozen pieces when I come home to visit.  

 The gyro is amazing! It is not the frozen blend of lamb that you see most college restaurants selling!  This is the actual meat on the spit style gyro.  My favorite dish is the \"Kofte Plate,\" it is basically a ground meat patty, chicken or beef, mixed with all sorts of wonderful goodies and spices.

I am not Muslim, but according to the owner, everything is prepared in the style of Halal cooking, which is equivalent to Jewish Kosher.  There are no pork dishes, and everything is done according to the religious codes.  If you are like me and your stomach has no laws binding it, the food is still wonderful. 

The last thing to mention, is the owner of the restaurant.  \"Josh\" is a great guy.  He goes out of his way to make you feel welcome in his restaurant, spending as much of his time in the dining area as he is kitchen cooking.  It's nice seeing restaurant owners being active with their customers.

Just my opinion, take it or leave it, but I know I'll be eating there no matter what you think."}
{"text":"I'm new to Pittsburgh and a friend recommended this place. I come from DC, so I have high Mediterranean food standards, but this place was DELICIOUS! Everything had great flavor and the customer service was fantastic. I didn't realize it was a cash only place, so they gave me my first lunch on the house! I will definitely be lunching at this place on the regular."}
{"text":"This is an amazing lunch spot.  I'm not normally a huge fan of middle-eastern/mediterranean food, but this place never disappoints.  Get the chicken and bulgar rice and point at a few side items. Expect a 15-20 minute wait during peak lunch hours, but it's always worth it."}
{"text":"the marinated baby lamb is insane.  the baba is excellent (nice smoke flavor), and portions overall are appropriate.  They serve a fluffy warm pita with hummus/baba, kabob sandwiches, etc. that is much better than the all too often dried out Pitaland brand pita common in Pittsburgh middle-eastern restaurants (pitaland is ok, but the fact that this place took the time to find a nice alternative is a plus).  Owner really tries hard to please which is appreciated but he can be a bit pushy (he means well though).  Honestly this place kills Alladin's Eatery. 4 stars is a lot for me."}
{"text":"Now, I've eaten at some great Mediterranean joints. Some fancy, some hole in the wall. But this place takes the cake (or Baklava if you have it).

Two things make this place truly awesome (which is the basic expectation from places you go to eat) - the food and the people. It might be a small 'fast food' shop in the basement of a corporate tower, but boy the food is good. They probably have the most perfectly cooked, juicy chicken I have ever eaten at a place where I have to struggle to push my meal cost to two digits. Add to that the Bulgar rice, side salad and a plethora of traditional sides and veges, and you have meal that will blow you away (and make it hard to finish). The sauces (especially the home-made hot sauce - which 
I think is made fresh everyday) also are an excellent addition to the meal.

The place is run by a family, and you are fed like you are part of the family (read it feels like a complete home cooked meal). The owner (Josh) is a wonderful guy - he cares more about you enjoying a satisfying meal, than taking your money for it. Multiple times he has told me to pay later if his CC machine doesn't work, and keeps throwing in free stuff all the time. 

Yes, this place doesn't have the best ambiance or even table service. Yes, this place has become a bit of a hole in the wall. Yes, this place runs out of food by 12:40 PM on most days. But, if you do manage to make it there on time and get your hands on a box full of delicious, you will leave leave happy and surely come back again."}

{"text":"The food here is really really good. I can't rate this place on food alone, however.  Ordering food here can be confusing, so once you find something you like, stick with it.  Sometimes they charge you $8, but other times they randomly charge you $11 or $12.  It doesn't make sense, especially when we joke amongst colleagues on who ordered what, and what did they charge?! I look forward to this place fixing their consistency.  I also look forward to them taking cards.  Carrying cash these days is a thing of the past! BUT - I will not stop going here for lunch in town...."}
{"text":"I love this place for lunch!  For $5, you get three vegetarian selections and a good sized portion of salad.  They also have hot choices - grilled veggies, gyros, etc - also super reasonably priced.  They usually have 6 - 8 (maybe more?) vegetarian choices that change frequently - taboulleh, hummus, spicy eggplant, beets, veggie fritters, bean salads, etc, etc.   I wish they were labeled to make it easier to choose, but they will let you sample things, so that helps.  The guys that run the place are always so welcoming and seem to truly appreciate your business.  Best lunch in town...especially for the $$!"}
{"text":"Getting lunch downtown is not always enjoyable. With the same few mediocre chain restaurants glutting the market (Au Bon Pain, Subway, etc.) it's easy to fall in to a rut. 

Enter Istanbul Grille:
The portions are generous. The prices are fair. The staff is friendly and personable. The food is excellent.

I, too, tried to pay with a card my first time there and also was told I could pay next time. When I offered the cash I did have (a $5 bill) the guy behind the counter refused to take it so I just tossed it in the tip jar. That's how you build a loyal customer base.

Note to first-timers: The ordering process is a little confusing so either go with someone who's been before (if you're the type who doesn't like seeming like a newbie around the regulars) or be prepared to ask a few questions. And try everything because it's all terrific."}
{"text":"I love, love, loooove the food here. It is the best. The chicken, the white rice, the chick peas and the green bean salad are the greatest. The lady that cooks the food is also the sweetest. I go once a week and highly recommend."}
{"text":"I am not sure whether the owner has been replaced or not. I am pretty sure now they are not that generous like they used to be. The food is great! But one thing is really confusing me. They may charge you randomly from $8 to 12 even you order same stuff every time. It doesn't make sense. I was told the white sauce was free. Then one time I ask the elder lady to add more white sauce she charged me $2. $2 with no any other sides : ( . Your place is already cash only, which mean you can save bunch of taxes and fees from visa. Why you still wanna be cheap?"}
{"text":"Generous portions of yummy Turkish food for a great price.  It is cash only, so I must admit that I don't get here as often as I would like because I don't carry cash often.  There is a gentleman there who seems to be the owner or manager with long black hair who is very nice.  I will often just let him make me a mix of whatever he thinks is good that day and I have never been disappointed.  The salad that comes with every meal has fanstastic dressing as well."}
{"text":"Really flavorful food. I had chicken, eggplant, and chickpeas. All was delicious. Will try to stop by again before I leave Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I don't know the exact menu names of the foods I just ate but I am so happy I just decided to check out the Istanbul Grille.  I was really craving a fresh meaty wrap or something, and shwarma crossed my mind, so I popped in for one but they were out of meat.  I was bumming while the owner explained that everything is that-day-fresh and so when they're out, they're out. 

I said, \"ok I'm super hungry though so I'll come back another time,\" and he was like, \"wait, do you have any allergies?\" I said I didn't and he started putting together a take-out container, asking if I liked this or that.  And I like everything so he loaded some delicious looking eggplant based sides, Babaghonnush and some tomatoe-y version atop a tossed salad with a fresh herb dressing and bulgar rice with housemade hot sauce, that was HOT.   

And then since I was clearly eating here,  I told him stuffed grape leaves are my fave, and he threw one top of it all along with 2 of the most decadent artichoke hearts I've tasted.  I asked him how much I owed him for this magnificent salad and he said it was on him!  Floored.  His employees were hard at work closing up for the day so I put a nice tip in the jar, but now that I've finished my lunch I wish I had put more in!  

A top notch lunch experience, I'll be back many times."}
{"text":"Really not a big fan of Turkish food but with great reviews thought I must check it out.  The chicken and bulgar rice were good.  I thought the eggplant was bland, cauliflower was a little better but not great, and cabbage was good.  Would not make this a destination but if you're in the area it offers decent eats."}
{"text":"This place is great!  The food is delicious and the owner is a really nice guy.  Not the cheapest food in Pittsburgh, but definitely worth it.  My personal favorite is the Chicken Shish-Kebab.  The meat is seasoned great, charred on the outside and tender on the inside.  I never thought chicken could be cooked that perfectly.  The rice pilaf that accompanies it is great too, and the salad is a good complement to the other flavors in the dish."}
{"text":"I'm so glad this Downtown staple opened in Regent Square!  The food is very flavorful and complex.  We started with the Chef's choice 9-item tapas platter, which is a must for the first time diner.  The meat on both the Lamb Adana and Beyti was seasoned very well throughout.  Be sure to ask for the spicy dipping sauces!

Dessert was spectacular - we had the 3-milk cake and burnt-top putting and will probably have to get both on subsequent visits.

The restaurant is currently BYOB because unfortunately they are located on the Edgewood side of Braddock which has a prohibition-era liquor license process. . ."}
{"text":"I work near by and eat here all the time.  There is usually a line around noon, so I try to go early or late.  The hot plate is always good and a ton of food.  Ordering your first time is a little bit strange since the menu is in the back out of sight until after you order."}
{"text":"Had lunch for the first time today at Istanbul, in the bottom of the USX building. All my coworkers have been raving about this place for weeks. My boyfriend brought up the idea of Turkish food to me just yesterday and I was super hesitant. But I'm so glad I decided to give this spot a try.

I went with my more seasoned coworker (I heard the ordering process was.... confusing, at best.... for newbies) and kind of watched how he ordered. They had choice for hot plates (if you wanted chicken you had to go outside - guess they're selling it out on the plaza), cold plates, etc. I went with the cold veggie plate and I made sure to mention it was my first time dining there.

The woman behind the counter was super great and kind of led me along all the food stations, asking if I had food allergies and inquiring what I liked. I'm not typically a fan of grape leaves but I found myself actually enjoying the one she gave me.

I think by the time she loaded up my container, I had some great salad, a grape leave, some orange rice-looking stuff that was great, killer hummus, some eggplant, a bean salad, some green bean stuff, yogurt sauce, beets and probably some other stuff I'm missing.

I forced myself to only eat half.... and trust me, I could've wolfed down the whole plate without stopping. Most of the time I didn't even know what I was eating, I just knew all the flavors were fantastic. I'm intensely looking forward to lunch tomorrow because that means leftovers. The whole meal cost me $9 - which for me, is a little high. I don't think I could make this a weekly stop.... but probably a once-a-month treat.

Check it out, even if you're hesitant. It was fabulous."}
{"text":"This is a cool little spot, but just remember to bring cash and point to what you want to order. None of the food is labelled so unless you have sharp eyes, it is hard for a regular Pittsburgh guy to identify the food.

I showed up at 1:30pm, and they were clearing down most of the food, so get there early if you want a hot meal.

They usually have lines at lunch time, and the food is pretty good, so I'll likely be back.

Another place serving similar food (but I think better quality and labeling) is Salonika's nearby at 133 6th heading towards the river from Liberty/Istanbul Grille."}
{"text":"This is probably the best lunch spot downtown.  Everything is under $10.  Get the salad or the meat plate with both lamb and chicken, and then proceed to give yourself a pat on the back.  Oh, and when they have the zucchini pancakes, get it."}
{"text":"This is always my go-to place for lunch downtown. Aside from the great food the owner is also hilarious. He often trolls his customers and regulars often play along with it much to the confusion of other new-comers. I've seen some people get actually offended over this, but I've seen many more come back to Istanbul again and again.

The bulgar wheat is great, as is the hummus, gyro plates, and hot sauce. Prices are good and they give you a ton of food. I honestly don't think I've had anything here that I haven't liked. It should also be noted that this a cash-only establishment and it is take out only (save for some stand up places to eat). 

Overall, you aren't going to find better Turkish food in the city and quite honestly I don't think you'll find a better lunch at this price downtown either."}
{"text":"This was the BEST dinner I have had in a Pgh in a loooong time. We started with the \"Little into the Middle\" (chef's choice combo of small, cold apps to eat with pita). That was so delicious, and a really nice variety of flavors; basically, I could have just kept going with those. We did share a chicken kebab entree, which was a hearty portion, fresh with super tender and flavorful chicken. The service was friendly and attentive. Plus it is BYOB. I may never eat anywhere else ever again."}
{"text":"Best food in all of downtown Pgh. You get tons and tons of food for around $10. Everyone that works there is super helpful if you're not familiar with Turkish food. Cash only! Everything here is to die for. I love the carrot salad and the babaghanoush for starters. Please try this place and give a family owned and operated business some service, I promise you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I have been down in the tunnel beneath the Steel Tower many times, but it is only in the last few months that I started getting take out from Istanbul Grille. I usually get the Bulger Rice with either meatballs or chicken. They add a little side salad and then you can choose both hot and cold sides. I get the mushrooms whenever they have them and always add baba ganoush. Delicious! When I add a can of soda it cost $13. You get a good portion of food, so the price is not that bad. Friendly staff and a good, quick meal."}
{"text":"Took the kids for lunch while we were on a trip, staying at the Marriot @ Chatham Sq. Let her know we were new and she piled up trays for my husband & I with samplings of multiple fresh, homemade items. The kids didn't see anything they wanted but she gave us small helpings of chicken for them which they loved. 
 The food was fantastic, flavorful & a huge portion. 
Great for takeout since the ambience is not ideal. Would definitely recommend, particular for a workday lunch. 
  Located under the steel building."}
{"text":"Finally, my people (Turkish) have a restaurant in Pittsburgh!

Went over on a whim. Walked in and found a menu scrawled in chalk on a board.  Wasn't too sure about that.

Lamb gyro.  Nope. No lamb that day.  Okay, fine, chicken gyro.  I thought why not.  It came with a salad and a choice of rice or spiced bulgar.

OMG.  Beyond heaven on earth.

I don't know how they do that chicken. It looks like spiced chicken breasts are just stacked on a spit like gyro meat and they shave off chunks.  I do not know what they put on that chicken - I swear it is like crack cocaine, it was so addictive, I could not stop eating it. Moist and tender with a crunchy side from the flames.  The salad was quite simple - lettuce, carrots.  Simple mediterranean dressing.  The bulgar - same damn crack cocaine in it, it was excellent.  So glad I chose that over the rice.  

They found out I was Turkish so they threw some samples in for me.  The stuffed grape leaves are rice only (boo hoo but I can live with it) but are made the right way with lemon and broth, very tender.  Many places forget the lemon and they are just bland but these are soooo very good.  They put a cold eggplant dish in there that was wonderful - it tasted much like a baba ganoush but it was chunky so not sure what it was but it was sooo very good.  

I will be back again for lunch.  I hear from the vanpool riders that the chicken salad is the best deal in town.  And I am dying to know what I was eating!   Seems that they have lots of interesting \"sides\" you can add - they do veggie plates as well with different cold marinated/spiced sides.

Only open for lunchtimes during the week so catch it for a quick takeout.

BTW - portions are very large. I barely ate 1/2 of my lunch and was full. Took the rest home to DH and #1 son who split it and agreed it was quite good.

Nice addition for those of us who enjoy good food at a reasonable price and don't want the chains."}
{"text":"Whatever you may have heard about Istanbul Grille, chances are it's all true! And if you haven't heard of Istanbul Grille, get there. Food is fresh, flavors are balanced and portions are huge. 

Coming here for the first time can be a little intimidating because the menu is basically Meal #1, Meal #2 and Meal #3. Really ambiguous, right? Especially when there are a dozen hot items to choose from and twice as many cold items. But just ask the workers and ultimately, it boils down to: you pick a main item, whether it be a protein or vegetable, and then you pick two sides. Easy as that. 

I ordered the meatballs atop bulgar rice with two cold sides: beets and cucumbers. The cold sides were served atop a salad. You also get a choice of hot sauce or cream sauce. I got the hot sauce which wasn't very hot at all. Meatballs were moist and flavorful. The cold sides were a nice refreshing touch to the comforting meatballs. 

My reason for docking a star was they really need to take down the Keystone Cafe signs as it really confused my lunch mate. From the outside, there isn't much that says Istanbul Grille. The old awning reading Keystone Cafe is still up and so is the lit sign in the window. At least unplug the lit sign, but the Keystone Cafe sign was still well-lit when we went there. This really led my coworker to think I was taking her to the wrong place. So if you're wanting to give it a try, just go in! All the signs for Istanbul Grille are inside!

Other than the sign situation, which I'm sure will be remedied over time, food was great and affordable. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I hate vegetables and am super sensitive to spices. That being said, I love eating at Istanbul Grille. The owner serves the food, and if it's your first time, you'd better come hungry. He will give you everything that you don't have an allergy to and doesn't take no for an answer. Think a friendly Soup Nazi. Usually only cash but you can always pay your next time. A Pittsburgh gem!"}
{"text":"I ate a lamb gyro wrap 2 days in a row for lunch because is was so good. They accept cash only at the outside tent and I did not know as I am here for a conference. The cashier was super nice and gifted my lunch on yesterday. The lamb was full of flavor and the red sauce added a nice kick. Although there's always a line, service is pretty fast. There's other options of salads and chicken if the lamb wrap isn't your thing. If you're ever around the area, do yourself a favor and stop by. Thanks for showing this Georgia girl lots of love!!"}
{"text":"Food is really good but over priced. I got a side of corn added to my meal and the lady gave me ONE TABLESPOON of corn and charged me A DOLLAR? Really?"}
{"text":"I've heard so much about Istanbul Grille. I was so excited when I started a new job and a fellow co-worker said he knew the owner. After seeing the delicious food he brought back from there occasionally he to me and some fellow co-workers over. We all went knowing we wanted to get the falafel, but were surprised to see so many delicious looking sides as well!

I had the falafel wrap. It was incredible. Like, I could eat this every day of the week increadible. Josh loaded up all of our plates with plenty of different sides as well. I'm not exactly sure what everything was, but I know i loved the garlic carrot salad and the grape leaves. He also let us sample some of the chicken, which was great. I can't wait to go back and try some of the other menu items. 

Getting to their location in the belly of the US Steel building can be a little confusing. I never would have gone had it not been for the recommendation of my co-worker. It'd be awesome to see them have their own location! My only reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is having to find seating in a food court area. But I've heard they plan on opening in a new, more easily accessible location with more seating. Fingers crossed!

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Simply put, this is the best lunch spot in Pittsburgh. You could eat here every day and not get sick of the food. Istanbul Grille uses the freshest ingredients and everything is made from scratch.

Aside from the impeccable quality of the food, the staff is extremely friendly and helpful, especially if it is your first time. The owner, Josh, is incredibly generous and will make sure that you want to come back again and again.

They are cash only but there are PNC ATMs upstairs, so hit them before you go down the escalator."}
{"text":"I had always wanted to go to this restaurant for lunch, but never quite seemed to make it over to the USX tower. Imagine how excited I was to find out that they moved a 2nd location into the old \"Keystone Cafe\" (Which I thought sucked, anyway. Glad THAT's gone!)!! A few of my coworkers went earlier this week and described it to me as \"kind of a buffet,\" which I was glad to hear because that means that there would likely be more offerings than what you typically see in chain restaurants that serve food from this part of the world. (e.g. gyro meat, hummus, yogurt, etc) 

And I was right!

Upon walking in, I saw that there were at least 12-15 side dishes - some I knew, some I did not. Here's the cool part: when it was my turn, I told the guy how happy I was that they opened in this location and that I was very excited to try some new things. I ordered \"Meal 3\" which is supposed to be a salad with 3 cold sides, but I ended up with a sampler box! He generously gave me little spoonfuls of almost everything on the serving table, and he was funny and charming while doing it! I ended up with this:

The \"base\" was a green salad with a very light but very flavorful vinegar-based dressing, cucumber salad, yogurt with dill and pine nuts, grape leaves, chic peas with tahini, beet salad, roasted red pepper and jalepeno sauces, hummus and spicy roasted eggplant.

The food itself is clearly planned and prepared by people who know Turkish food, and it is out of this world!

The service, the food, and the price were right. I will absolutely go back to Istanbul and will recommend it to everyone I know!!!

3/9/2016: UPDATE
I went back today and the owner was just as friendly and funny as last time! He truly treats customers like friends! I wish I could work for this guy!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing service and food. I have eaten here on numerous occasions for lunch and have never been disappointed. The portions are huge so you never leave feeling hungry. I usually spend between $10-$11 and it's worth it! Everyone there is helpful and if it is your first time let them know and they will help you out."}
{"text":"After working in the Steel Tower for over 10 years I finally made it to Istanbul Grille (granted their tenure in that spot is shorter 10 years) and I'm super glad I made it!  It is a small location with just enough room for a queue of people and those being served their food.  The pricing and food options are clearly labeled and the prices are excellent.  For $10 you get a protein, rice, salad, and it is AMAZING.

The food tasted fresh and the flavors were so powerful and bright.  I think my favorite thing was the diversity of flavors and temperatures.  The rice was excellent as well as the chicken, the sides both cold and hot were eye opening to the Turkish food palate.

I've been back twice.  And will certainly keep coming back!"}
{"text":"First, I cannot say enough about the owner's of this restaurant.  They were kind service was amazing and quite possibly the nicest individuals I have ever met.  

Second the food was fantastic it was a wonderful combination of flavors, the chicken was excellent.  If you are in Pittsburg you should stop by this food stand, trust me you are missing something."}
{"text":"Great new place! The food here was delicious. The lamb kabobs were so fresh and cooked to perfection. All of the sides to sample were amazing. Will definitely be back to this one. BYOB to top it off! Make sure to try it out!"}
{"text":"this place is . seriously i went with my sister and her bf, and we literally stopped talking except to say\"mmmmm\" after every bite for like 20 minutes. everything was amazing (if you like spicy ask for the hot hot sauce!) and its byob. the doner/gyro literally is the best thing i have ever eaten (seriously, its so tender and flavorful, get it or the mixed grille which comes with it)! also, the owner is super friendly and obviously cares a lot about the food and his customers!"}
{"text":"I just ate at the new Regent Square location and was very impressed.  

The Little, Little into the Middle tapas platter with nine different tapas was fantastic tasting and a good value for the amount and variety of food.  The flavors were very vibrant and very fresh.   

The yaprak doner (gyro) was also excellent, and the zucchini pancakes were quite literally the best version of that dish I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"Amazing service and even better food. First time there and I work in the building. Large servings and when the owner figured out I was vegetarian he took time to explain they never use the same serving spoons, mix dishes etc. can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Oh no, don't say its so!

I've been meaning to get around to writing a review for Istanbul (it's one of my three go-to lunch staples when I need to be in-and-out), but I figured I'd eventually get around to it...   until today.

For those of you who haven't heard, Josh has been given 30 days notice by his landlord that his lease will not be renewed.  Apparently Midland Towers wants to let the 7-11 expand into this space, which would result in the loss of one of this city's greatest lunch spots.

Is Istanbul inconsistent?  Yes.  Does the price vary depending on who serves you and what mood they're in?  Yes.  Does that matter?  No.

At no time have I ever been charged more than $10 for a standard Chicken Plate (chicken, wheat rice, salad).  What that represents is one of the best deals for a quality lunch in the city (sans Sree's and a few other discount offerings).  If you do yourself one favor for lunch, get your fill of this perfectly marinated, perfectly broiled (gyro style), perfectly shaved and crispy chicken breast.  Most times, the fiancee and I share just one of these massive boxes (see my photo), and we still end up stuffed.

Josh goes out of his way to take care of his customers.  The regulars frequently get freebies and the newbies regularly get the star treatment.  Don't know what to get?  Let them know and they'll talk you though all of the hot and cold options (it can be a little overwhelming if you aren't familiar with the setup).

My favorites include:

Chicken plate (stated above)
Chicken salad
Cold plate (slew of vegetarian cold salads)

Must adds:

Grape leaves
Hummus
and by all means, whatever hot sauce concoction they whip up for the day

No seating except for a two standing bars.  Most people, when the weather is nice, venture next door to EQT Park or similar.

Lets hope the city rallies behind Istanbul (a few groups already have) and Josh gets to either keep his current spot or is provided an opportunity to expand somewhere else."}
{"text":"Yes, the way to my heart is with a free zucchini pancake! Along with consistently yummy chicken salads with white sauce & baba ghanouj & fast service at lunch rush. Takeout from Istanbul Grille makes lunch in my cubicle happy, not sad."}
{"text":"They have closed the Craig St place and are now just at their new place at  305 N Craig St near (across from) the Market Basket. We went there for lunch and were very impressed. All their stuff is made there except for the Pita Bread. Prices are modest and the staff friendly. Their Humas was first class as well as their babagonush, Teir grill lamb was very good.  They also had great homemade hot source."}
{"text":"I had a lamb wrap and baba ganoush and it came with some salad. Portions are a good size and everything was seasoned well and tasty, except the salad -1. This is a prepped meal place, so everything is laid out in front of you to choose from. For $8 I had a wonderful lunch."}
{"text":"This place used to be AMAZING! And I don't mean when it was Keystone Cafe (though it was then, too). But after the Instanbul team took over, the food was delicious, nutritious and PLENTIFUL. After lunch today, when I could've fit my vegetarian platter in the palm of my hand, I'm so sad! Eight bucks isn't a ton by lunch standards, but for that I could get something far better at Chipotle. What happened?!"}
{"text":"Simply put, this is the best food that Downtown Pittsburgh has to offer. Go. Get. Now."}
{"text":"There are many things I miss about working in Downtown Pittsburgh, but none so much as Istanbul grille.

This is, hands down, some of the best food in Downtown. Go and get everything. Get the bulgur rice. Get the chicken. Get the meatballs, or the tabouli or the creamy beet salad. (I LOVE the creamy beet salad) Get the hummus and the baba ganoush and then say \"surprise me.\" No matter what they give you, you will not be disappointed.

Other things to know:
They are cash only
There is always a line
There is always a line for a very good reason

Get after it."}
{"text":"Amazing food and outstanding service. A new favorite restaurant, will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Food's good, and you definitely get a lot of it.  But I'm giving 2 stars for two big reasons, one a bit more subjective than the other:

Subjective reason: My colleague and I both felt a bit queasy after our recent lunch there.  Our stomachs just felt off.  Enough so that I don't want to eat there again.

Objective reason: The servers, when I went there, did not use gloves at all when serving food, they served food right after handling money, and worst of all, the guy (with a ponytail) kept brushing back his hair (or wiping sweat off, who knows) right before serving food.

To recap, that's: Touch Hair, Serve Food, Handle Money, Serve Food, etcetera...  Not a bottle of Purell in sight.

So that was pretty gross.  Again, I can agree with the food quality comments others have posted.  But I ain't gonna eat there again; the servers' hygiene is just lacking.  If they fixed that, I would go back."}
{"text":"Im not going to rehash everyone elses reviews of this place....I just wanted to make sure I acknowledged the outstanding food I had here and thank my fellow yelpers for not steering me wrong on this place. I was in town for a conference and turned to yelp for ideas on food that was \"local.\" The owner was a personality and I enjoyed all the stuff he put in my box...not sure what it all was, but I am sure it was all delicious."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in the Cultural District.  This place is packed with a line out the door by 11:45 and can be intimidating for rookies. There is no posted menu- but Josh (owner) will guide you through. 

Diners form a crazy line and shout out chicken salad, cold plate, hot plate, etc. and then proceed down the aisle of fresh, healthy, and delicious side options. I go for the hot chicken plate with \"wheat rice.\"  This includes a heaping portion of their special salad (iceberg lettuce, oil, vinegar, and spices), rice, and chicken. Then comes the fun part- adding everything from hummus, to grape leaves, to tabouli.  All of this in a big (full) square styrofoam container, perfect to take next door to a little park area. If you have never been, say so!  Often the staff will create a yummy sampler that will have you coming back. 

The down side- cash only and crazy line. However, the staff is friendly, the food is amazing, and prices can't be beat. 

Unfortunately, they will soon be moving. Come and get it while you can and follow them to their new spot TBD."}
{"text":"A friend of mine has been talking this place up to the point where I decided to try it out today for lunch.  It couldn't have been more perfect for a Lenten Friday, because trust me, I did not miss out on the meat at all.  I asked for a salad plate with anything that the owner cared to give me, as it was my first time and I knew that I would want to try everything.  And boy, did he deliver.  I wish I could recall everything that I ate, but I consisted roughly of a bed of dressed salad, topped with hummus, baba ghanooj, beet salad, two types of tabbouleh (Middle Eastern and Turkish styles), something with carrots, tzatiki, and some spicy sauce that I will definitely be getting on ev-er-y-thing I order from there from now on.  That wasn't even everything they have on offer--I saw cucumber salad, dolmas, chickpeas, and a few other items too.  All of their cold sides, by the way, are not only vegetarian, but also vegan if you're looking for that as well.

I'm SO satiated, but not sluggish.  My breath smells faintly of garlic, and I don't care.  If there was *anything* missing, it would have been great to have a piece of pita bread to sop up the salad from my container with.  Oh, and all of this was *very* reasonably priced.  I shall have to make this a regular takeout lunch spot.  Just keep in mind that they are cash only."}
{"text":"I don't usually write food reviews but I have to let people know that the owner of this establishment is first class and genuinely a decent human being.  This was my first visit to Pittsburgh and I wanted to try some of the local cuisine.  I have never eaten Turkish food and the restaurant was in walking distance from my hotel, so I thought I would give it a try.  It seems to be a family owned business.  The gentleman that helped me with my order was the owner and cook.  It was close to their closing time and I told him that I was not familiar with Turkish food and wanted to know what he recommended.  He told me all of it was good, so he fixed me a plate with a little bit of several items for me to try.  When it was time to pay I realized he only accepted cash and I only had my debit card.  Instead of making a big deal about it or embarrassing me, he told me to not worry about it and just enjoy the food.  I felt bad because it was my last day in town and I went there before heading to the airport.  After eating the food I felt worse because the food was great!  The chicken was tender and well seasoned. The vegetable rice and green beans were delicious.  The food is definitely authentic and homemade.  He even makes his own hot sauce which gives the food the right amount of heat and flavor.  I want to thank the owner for his generosity and his great food.  I have sent you a check for the food and I hope you receive it soon.  I wish you and your restaurant much success in the future!! Çok te?ekkür ederim! 

If you are visiting Pittsburgh and in the mood for homemade Turkish food, check out Istanbul Grille.  I don't believe you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this joint. While the place is spartan, at best, the food is superb. The servers are friendly and it seems they have enough repeat business that they recognize others on sight. I've never had a qualm with the hygiene or service in this place.

I usually get either the lamb or chicken schwarma (gyro) with bulgar rice and salad. The portion sizes are large enough to fill a person up. Occasionally, I'll get some crispy bits, which I love. The bulgar rice is great and the salad portion is large.

Occasionally, I'll get one of the eggplant offerings, which are also delicious. The hummus is good as some of the other smaller offerings.

This is a cash-only place, which is a bit of a bummer, but certainly not enough to prevent me from coming back."}
{"text":"Great food! Friendly service. As a Turkish citizen I have to mention the quality of their meats and how well they are marinated. I was lucky enough to try their Doner kebab (which is known as Gyro in US but Turkish version is much tasty IMO) before they open formally. I also know their meze varieties are delightful from their other location in downtown. Since they are close by I'll probably visit them very often and try their other specials. Thanks for making me fell like I'm in an authentic Turkish restaurant."}
{"text":"We heard about this place from a friend that highly recommended it ( not just once lol). Finally made it there and I must say that it was one of the best dining experiences I've had! The atmosphere is amazing, very relaxing and comforting. Restaurant itself is just beautiful! Wait staff was beyond pleasant and welcoming.  The other thing is food. It's absolutely DELICIOUS! We had a lamb shish kebab and the meat was so soft and tender! Fresh and perfectly seasoned. Had a chance to try a couple of appetizer samplers ( thanks to the owner, who was very nice to us) and they too were absolutely incredible. Definitely coming back. I left the restaurant with such a satisfaction that there's no chance I won't be back a couple dozen times more lol Definitely recommend! Would put 10 stars if I could :)"}
{"text":"My partner and I were meandering around at 9:30pm on Braddock Ave looking for a late dinner and were pleased to see that Istanbul was open until 11pm on a Thursday evening. We were starving and this place was so delicious and our server was very sweet! All the food tasted amazing and prepared with only fresh vegetables (no cans, preservatives, minimal salt and no butter)! We tried a bunch of different things and they were all to die for. We were the only folks in the restaurant, and the chef came out and introduced himself after we placed our order and he was very friendly. He even brought out several free samples of some of the tapas. We loved everything! I ordered the creamy beet salad to start and it was on point. After our meal, with very full bellies we began to walk to down the street and the chef hollered out to us beckoning for us to come back. I thought I'd forgotten something, but instead he just wanted to send us home with some of his baklava! So generous! We left feeling overwhelmed with gratitude and in a state of blissful food coma. Hands down an amazing experience."}
{"text":"A downtown lunch destination offering fresh Turkish cuisine served by friendly people at this efficiently run basement-level take-out in the U.S. Steel building. (Tip: take the escalator down from the plaza-level entrance.) On my first two visits, I've enjoyed the lamb and chicken with salad and a variety of cold sides - I recommend the baba ghanouj and creamy beets. I like to carry my meal up to the plaza to eat in the sun on mild days."}
{"text":"First time here(this location).  I have been going for years.  I remember when Josh was where Yovi's used to be on liberty.  I frequent USX several times a month.  This is much more space.  The food is just as good.  No falafel when I went?  The chicken pita was great.  Josh has best baba in Pittsburgh.  Don't leave with out trying some sides.  Nothing to be intimidated by, everything is great.  If you are vegan many options and even a vegan baba.  Keep up the passion for great food.  A definite gem in the Pittsburgh culinary scene.  If you leave here hungry you must never get filled up."}
{"text":"Calling this food Manna from Heaven does not feel like an exaggeration. Eating this for lunch today made me honestly reconsider every other 5 star Yelp review I've ever written. Literally every mouthful was make-you-cry delicious. Mentioning I was a first-timer caused the server to give me extra little tastes of all the things she liked best, and out-of-this-world begins to describe her choices. 5 stars just doesn't seem like enough, frankly."}
{"text":"***Cash Only***

I do love Istanbul Grill! I was introduced to this place a few years ago when they were in a different location and visit for lunch a few times a month. Everything is fresh and there's enough of a selection that you probably won't get sick of it.  What I do get a little sick of, however, is the discrepancy with pricing. I always get the $8 cold plate, or the option #3, which is the salad and 3 sides. If Josh is there, you get extra sides. If someone else is there, you can get your extra sides but it's suddenly $10.  That's fine, because I would normally leave $10 anyway, I just wish it were the same no matter who took your order. 

I hate to complain but at least that's the only complaint!  My favorite side is the beets, idk what they do to those beets but I often crave them! No matter what you order, make sure to get a little dollop of the white sauce on top. So good!  If you're in the area, get your cash and run to Istanbul!!"}
{"text":"WOW! Passing through Pittsburg for the weekend with my parents, and we basically picked a restaurant at random for a quick bite on the way to the Frick museum and it could not have worked out better! We shared the tapas sampler and the mixed grill. Definitely more food than I was expecting! The meat was juicy and tender, and the tapas were deliciously seasoned and rich but still bright and fresh. The staff were also incredibly friendly and offered us some extra sauces, spreads, and tabbouleh to try (on the house!) This is the kind of place that lifts your spirits!"}
{"text":"This is a six star customer service and quality/taste place. 

It might be a bit tricky to find it as it's at the lower ground level of US Steel tower but it's completely worth the trip down the escalator and hallway. 

So many delicious options to choose from! Not to mention plenty of healthy vegetarian options, too. The owners are incredibly sweet, nice and engaging. Can't wait to come back. 

I strongly recommend this excellent place to everybody who likes delicious and healthy food. Be aware to bring cash though as they don't accept credit cards."}
{"text":"Loved it!  Very tasty, authentic, quick and generous servings.  My husband and I really enjoyed it and would recommend it -though we kinda hope less know about it so we can keep it to ourselves :)"}
{"text":"This place is great.  

I am a first-time visitor.  The food is delicious.  If you like middle eastern food, it is definitely a must try.  

Although the food was great, the primary reason I am writing this review is treatment I got from the owner.  He had a great attitude and was joking with the customers.  When I went to pay, I tried to hand him a credit card because the sign on the door indicated that credit card was an acceptable form of payment.  Unfortunately, the credit card machine was broken.  I would have expected to have to forfeit my meal, but the owner simply said \"You just pay next time.\"  

I was shocked and offered to run to an ATM and come back.  But he refused and let me go on my way.  Couldn't have been nicer.  I definitely will return (to pay my bill obviously).  But honestly, if he was trying to let his food speak for itself to ensure my return, he definitely succeed there too.  I highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"One of the more unique places to eat in the Steel building and all of downtown.  It took me a couple of years before trying this place and I really regret it.

First, the customer service here is amazing.  Every worker is very helpful and friendly.  If it is your first time they will help you and not make you feel awkward or rushed.  The first time I ever went here I didn't realize it was cash only until after my meal had been partially made.  I told the worker this and was preparing to walk away before she told me to not worry about it.  I was confused at first but she said to just make sure to come back and eat again and not to worry about paying this time.  I can't think of any other establishment in downtown Pgh that would do this.  I was sure to go back the next day, both for another meal and to thank the workers.

The options are all very fresh and authentic Turkish/Greek food.  My favorite is the gyro with white sauce and the side salad they give you.  Both the chicken and lamb gyro are delicious.  Very filling and flavorful.  The side salad is also very unique and goes perfect with their food.  I usually throw in a grape leaf or two as well."}
{"text":"Took some friends here recently who came to visit from out of town and we all loved it! Everyone got something different and we just tried each other's food. I got the lamb it was so good. We also got the cold sampler for an appetizer and I loved that as well. Nothing beat the Turkish coffee at the end of dinner. I'm definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, Istanbul Grille is one of the best restaurants in downtown Pittsburgh.

Their specialty is fresh Turkish cuisine - chicken shawarma, tabbouleh, bulgur and wheat rice, incredible fresh vegetables, artfully seasoned salads, grape leaves, and much more. There's no menu, you order cafeteria-style, which gives you an opportunity to sample all the options.

What really makes this place special, though, are the staff. Josh (the owner) and his colleagues are extremely friendly and caring people. I don't think I've ever had lunch there without seeing them give someone a discount or freebie. They treat regulars and \"newbies\" alike very well and are just wonderful people to be around.

Also, the tabbouleh is amazing. Now if they'd just serve Turkish coffee...!"}
{"text":"I'm drawn to any eatery with abundant vegan and vegetarian options, and this place certainly fits the bill.  During our Friday visit, there were well over a dozen hot and cold options for delicious vegetable-based sides, not to mention numerous pickles and toppings.  My plate was loaded with a bite of nearly everything for $12, and the lady servers were super patient with my many questions as a first-time customer, which invariably slowed down their line considerably during a busy lunchtime service.

The hot cabbage, cauliflower, and green bean dishes ended up being my favorite, though the cold mushroom salad, eggplant salad, and many others were tasty as well.  The spicy pepper sauce was delicious over everything.  My friend greatly enjoyed her lamb gyro as well.

Istanbul Grille certainly lives up to the hype, and I'll definitely be back, especially to try out their new second location.  Here's hoping they extend their hours for dinner in the future!"}
{"text":"Finally made it for lunch after reading (and re-reading) reviews during my last couple trips to Pittsburgh.  I can say it lives up to the hype. The food is very good, authentic  and the service is very pleasant. My only piece of feedback is that their menu system is a bit confusing and it gets very busy during the lunch exacerbating the situation.

I ordered a mixed lamb & chicken pita sandwich which comes with a pre-dressed simple salad. I added a few cold items on the salad for an extra charge. I went with the baba, eggplant and white beans. I told them it was my \"highly anticipated first visit\" and they gave me smaller samples of 3 other sides. Everything was really good I thought the pita itself (and the spicy sauce they put on it) as well as the white beans were the highlights. Service was quick but if you're in a rush pass on the pita/wraps as the rice/salad platters move much faster.

As many other mention it's cash only so grab cash at the ATMs on the way down. (To find the location enter the Steel building on street level and go behind the escalators up to the next level to find another set of escalators down. Once on the next level down go around the escalators through the doors. Istanbul Grille is at the end of the hall pass the other restaurants.)"}
{"text":"I am in town for one night and in my search for a vegan option that was close to my hotel I stumbled upon this lovely Grille in the basement foodcourt at 600 Grant steeet .
The food was fresh, tasty and the woman helping me to choose options was a super sweet lady!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!  Food is fantastic and unbelievable hospitality! Welcome to Regent Square Josh.  So happy to have you here."}
{"text":"One of the best Turkish restaurants in Pittsburgh! Food, prices, service, and atmosphere were all great. We had the chef's choice appetizer which was delicious and had such different flavors that were out of this world. I'd like to buy their hot sauces to take home! We will definitely be back for another dinner!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, but what's even better is the customer service. I stopped in with 2 of my friends and we were given samples, a great overview of our options, 1 free side since it was our first time stopping in. Also, one guy with us wasn't getting anything. The gentleman behind the counter wouldn't let him leave without trying something, so he provided him with 2 little samples - 1 of beets and 1 of carrots. My friend doesn't like beets or carrots but was in shock when he loved both of the dishes he was provided. This place is so good and I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Just wanted to update that they changed the menu around a bit and now you can get a Vegetarian entree w/ salad for $7.50.  I didn't think it could get any better!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today after reading so many good reviews. I was not disappointed. I really had no idea what to get so I ordered the \"Meal 2\" option which was salad, bulger/rice, and choice of three vegetable. 

I got the bulger with eggplant, spinach, and lentils. It was fantastic. I added hummus for an extra $1 and the flavors were all exactly what I was craving. Everything looked so good I had a hard time deciding what to order! I will absolutely be back to experiment with some of the other offerings. 

Plus, the servings are large so I'll be able to stretch it into two lunches--a total win-win!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for something different from my usual routine and decided to try this place because of the good reviews.  I know absolutely nothing about Turkish food so I cannot judge its authenticity, but regardless, I really enjoyed the food.  

I told the guy (I assume he was the owner/manager based on his demeanor) I didn't know anything about Turkish food and wasn't sure what exactly to try.  He asked me if I have any allergies and proceeded to fill my tray with items he recommended.   

The food was very good and great value for $10.  The only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because there were no menus or labels on the food.  I understand that they recently relocated and that perhaps they didn't get a chance to fully setup their signs yet.   Either way, I won't let the lack of menus deter me from going back.  Great food and service!"}
{"text":"Wow, just wow - food was great!  I went in for a late lunch, I got there right before they were closing so they had run out of many of the hot plate dishes.  The guy behind the counter said he'd make me a cold plate with some different options so I said OK.  

Cost was $6 - extremely reasonable for the amount of food that I received.  He gave me hummus, eggplant, carrot salad, bean salad, tomato salad all on top of salad!  I wasn't even sure what I was in the mood for when I went to grab some lunch, but I can confidently say that this hit the spot.  

Everything was so flavorful - the standout dishes were the hummus, bean salad, and tomato salad.  Next time I'm going to get there earlier to try their hot foods."}
{"text":"I have been intending to eat here for over a year, but since every time I walked by, there didn't appear to be a menu (it's hidden behind the soda machine), they do not accept credit cards, and there is no tables to sit at (there is a standing bar), I have avoided them. Today I had a Gyro chicken salad ($6.50). I enjoyed it an will come back in the future. However, the guys running the place sass the customers, and flirt with the women patrons, so it's like a Seinfeld episode of the Soup Nazi. I'm also not a fan of the guy handling cash and food at the same time and passing it over the food.

{"text":"Wow. I recently started temporary work in the steel tower and decided to adventure today instead of eating my boring lunch. After realizing there was a basement in the building with restaurants and businesses, I stumbled upon Istanbul grille. They had the most DELICIOUS Turkish/Mediterranean food and the portions were HUGE! They even threw in an extra topping for me to try being a new customer. I had a chicken platter with rice, beans, salad, radishes, cucumbers, mushroom salad, baba ganoush, tzatziki, grape leaves, and pita bread for 12 DOLLARS!! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Cash only! It's well worth the stop! The boy and I usually only go when it's nice outside since they really don't have anywhere to sit, so we usually sit outside next door in the EQT plaza. We get the hot veggie platter with some hot sauce and hummus (me, not the boy) and it is very good! YUM. The staff hackles the customers but I think that adds to the charm?"}
{"text":"It's been some time since I first set foot into Istanbul Grille, and at this point, I feel like family in there.

Josh (the owner) works his butt off and he's got his family backing him up.  However they do it is a mystery to me.  What I see as a jumbled mess of styrofoam containers and tongs, they see as a daily bob and weave of culinary delights.

But here's the issue.  The meat has gone dry.  For real.  It saddens my soul.

Word on the street is that there is more support going into the Lawrenceville location (or perhaps another location is opening) or the source of meat has changed.  I'm not exactly sure of the details, but the chicken I know and love is simply not the same.

I guess I might be moving to the veggie plate... still delicious, but the loss of the chicken in the past week is simply heartbreaking.  Heartbreaking."}
{"text":"I had lunch here for the second time today, and the food tasted just as fresh and flavorful as I remembered. However, during my last visit I was told Meal 1 came with three sides, but this time I was told Meal 1 came with just one side. Please make your menu and pricing clearer!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Turkish restaurant! We tried the tapas platter and ground lamb. Both were served family style and came with warm pita and hot sauces. The tapas platter is what will keep me coming back again and again. It's chef's choice and the platter includes nine vegan or vegetarian tapas. My favorites were stewed eggplant with tomatoes, hummus, and potato salad, though all were excellent! Staff were very nice and the chef/owner circulated the tables to check on everyone.

We arrived at 5:30 on a Saturday. By the time we left at 7, I was so excited to see that every single table was full. Can't wait to come back with a group and take advantage of BYOB."}
{"text":"Hands down, my FAVORITE place to eat lunch downtown.

I go to Istanbul Grille for lunch at least twice a week and I have never had a bad meal. They also give you plenty of food, so it is more than worth the price."}
{"text":"Fresh, from scratch and healthy food served with big smiles. I love this place for lunch!"}
{"text":"the best food modern and homemade, mediterranean !!! Josh did it !!! welcome to regent sq !!! we are happy to have you here!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here at least 10 times, but today put it over the top for me - and seeing as it's been long enough since I've reviewed something, Istanbul Grille deserves my re-inauguration to Yelp. 

I get the vegetarian plate. For $6. Everytime. All of their sides are vegetarian, so you can't go wrong - they also do meat on a spit for gyros, or chicken, or you can have it on a salad. The owner makes this amazing spicy sauce that is perfect on anything - I'm convinced. 

And if you're lucky to swing by on a day he's behind the counter, he'll happily give you a little taste of a few of his other specialties ... bulgar salad, chickpeas, lentils, babaganoush, bean salad, hummus, grape leaves ... and as he says, \"it's not babganoush .... it's THE BEST babaganoush\". 

P.S. Cash only, and some standing room to snack - don't complain, it keeps their costs down."}
{"text":"I'm tired of Chipotle now. It's time for something new. . .like Istanbul Grille. The man who waited on me - who I assume was the owner- was very warm friendly. He made me feel very welcomed and that was a big plus for me. For my meal, I chose a chicken salad along with three sides. The owner was very generous and gave me extra sides for no additional costs. I  had so much food that I couldn't even eat it all. I loved all the different vegetables and flavors. I wish Istanbul Grille was located in my neighborhood as I would go there to eat every week if I could. The food and service was great and I will definitely come here more frequently!"}
{"text":"Terrific food. My wife and I shared a little of everything. The lamb sauté was seasoned perfectly. The chicken meatballs were just the right texture. I have never had juicy chicken gyro meat before eating here.

The sides were also very good. The hummus was delicious and creamy, not grainy. The eggplant was yummy, and I never like eggplant. 

And the guy who runs the place has a great personality. I was confused about the locations on Yelp, but we stayed at the Omni close by, so I walked to the building where this one is, and he was tending to the outdoor setup they have in place for the summer. They only do wraps and stuff there. When I asked if there was a permanent place I could get more stuff, he walked me to it, and had suggestions galore when putting together our meal. 

A terrific experience all the way around."}
{"text":"Best restaurant and best service in Regent Square!! 

This is no exaggeration.

Highly recommend getting the mixed appetizer and dinner platter followed by the most amazing baklava and Turkish tea. 

So glad we have this in walking distance. 

Never leave us Istanbul Grille!"}
{"text":"Authentic, delicious, fresh and served with love. This family owned restaurant got it right. So charming. We started with an appetizer that has a little of everything. Carrot salad, beet salad, hummus, beans salad, grape leaves just to name a few. All of the flavors were coming alive in your mouth. You can tell that everything is home made and fresh. We then has the lentil soup and the owner suggested we squeeze a little fresh lemon on top....it was Devine. Then for dinner I had a special Gyro made with beef and lamb..once you taste this you will never settle for a frozen Gyro again. This Gyro was so fresh and the flavors were subtle not over powering the flavor of the meat. My friend had the lamb kebab also fresh and delicious. Not gamey at all. Both dishes came with rice and lots of fresh veggies. To end we had a dessert that was out of this world. It was made with shredded wheat, a special white cheese inside, a sweet water sauce and pistachio drizzled on top. Unlike anything you have ever tasted. Not too sweet, just right way to end a perfect dinner.The atmosphere was very pleasant, soft music in the background and the owners,brother and sister, walked around to each table chatting with all of the patrons and making them feel like part of the family. You do not want to miss this gem. They have something for everyone from vegan to meat eaters and everything in between.  It is BYO and they accept credit cards."}
{"text":"This tiny little gem lived up to all the local hype! While at a meeting in the Steel Tower, my colleagues highly recommended I try this place. I had to literally run down the escalators to catch it while it was open (it's only open until 2 pm), I got there with minutes to spare. The woman behind the counter greeted me so warmly. Turns out they only take cash so I had to sprint back upstairs to the ATM. By the time I got back and was ready to order, almost all the food they had was sold out (the sign of a very popular joint!) but she was kind enough to quickly make some fresh salad for me. When she learned I had never been there before, she excitedly put together a plate of what was left, which was salad, chicken and beef meatballs, chicken shawarma, hummus and some beans.  I loved every bite!  The ingredients were so fresh and flavorful.  The food clearly made from scratch and with lots of love. I am so jealous of the lucky folks who work in this building."}
{"text":"Lamb wrap was really tasty! Huge portions. Perfect. This place will be my go-to now."}
{"text":"I had never been here before hearing a co-worker rave.  There are no instructions on how to order, and no prices listed.  the  woman was nice when I asked how to order, but didn't really explain.  she just started coming out four or so different dishes while giving a one word description.

  I have been back twice and still don't understand her system.  I've never even been offered one of the numerous cold dishes.  that said, the food is delicious, if pricey."}
{"text":"Josh is back. He makes the best Turkish food ever. It is fresh, healthy and tastes so good. I always get the lamb or chicken with salad and sides. You have to try the sides he makes fresh. You will not leave hungry and your wallet will not get hit hard. Love this place, my go to place a few times a week."}
{"text":"My first time here.  I hate spending money on lunch when I'm eating alone.  I told them it was first time and they were very helpful and funny about it.  I'm sure they are lines they've used before, but their demeanor was great.   They're opening another location in Regent Square soon.  I think he said next week!

The food was fantastic.  Chicken salad with a sampling of side dishes. So good.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is incredible! Fresh, flavorful, authentic food and such a friendly staff - you'll be hooked after one try. 

Tip: Go for the lentils. They're fabulous!"}
{"text":"Vegetarians Delight! I told them it was my first time and asked what they suggested and everything I got was Oh So Very Good!

I'm told they cater and I'm going to used them for a future party!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely and without question one of my very favorite lunch spots in downtown Pittsburgh. It is tucked away in the Steel Building tunnel (heading to the Subway station). This is one of the best hidden gems in the burgh.  

The food here is just tremendous. It is home cooked daily in small batches so it is always fresh and flavorful. You never quite know what they may have any given day, skewer chicken one day, lamb the next, meatballs tomorrow. Who knows. All I do know is that it has never let me down when it comes to flavor. It is always well seasoned and cooked perfectly. It can also be somewhat intimidating to order, but don't let that stop you. The folks are incredibly accommodating and happy to help out, though they did finally add a \"menu board\" to help out. Basically though its just an ala carte setup with several rice options, salads, vegetables, hummus, grape leaves, baba ganoush etc. Also when available the home made hot sauce is spectacular. 

The real star here though is Josh, the owner and chef. He is a charming, charismatic guy who makes it a point to interact with every person who wants to eat there. Walks first timers through the whole experience and gives you more than enough reason to want to come back beyond the delicious food. Tip there, don't be afraid to mention it's your first time. Tip 2, it's cash only. Normally this would tick me off and cost a place a star, but here, i've forgotten to bring cash a few times and without exception Josh has told me, \"no worries, pay me next time\". Made me a customer for life.

Try this place!! You will not regret it."}
{"text":"It's a tiny place, but the kabobs are great! The owner is really nice and friendly, and it's basically just him doing all the work and then a delivery guy. This is the type of food you will have cravings for afterwards."}
{"text":"Glad to have Istanbul Grille in Regent Square!  We dined there recently and enjoyed the tapas platter which consisted of 9 small samples of their extensive tapas menu, served with plenty of pita bread. The hummus, babaghonush and other tapas were all very tasty.  As were the zucchini pancakes, grilled vegetables and chicken thighs.  In addition to chicken, there are the usual lamb and beef options but no fish. There are plenty of things for a vegetarian or vegan to choose from.  Plus it's BYOB with no corkage fee.  We'll definitely be going back soon to sample other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"The man who started it all, Josh, had to be THE friendliest restaurant/business owner I've ever me! He is very welcoming and dedicated not only to his business, but also to his customers. 

There is not a written menu listing, so you just go ahead and order what you'd like to eat \"cafeteria\" style. You'll get to pick from a wide range of sides including my ultimate favorite Mediterranean veggie dish: dolmades, humus, tabuleh salad, grilled eggplant in labneh yogurt just to name a few. You also have a meat-option (shawarma chicken) which was perfectly flavored!

If I could, I would probably eat there every single time I craved Mediterranean cuisine. 

$10 gets you a full meal that you can take to go, and enjoy at the park right next door."}
{"text":"What a beautiful restaurant. It is well positioned  and the staff were gracious and respectful. Awesome people. 

The owner/chef Josh Is always present but humble and seems insignificant but he is watching every motion without being loud and self important. Impressive man.

I chose the 9 course tasting menu which is like appetizers platter(little little into the middle) and I loved it and they have one the best gyro I had in Pittsburgh. This menu works. Every part of it. Simple but intellectual cooking. Maybe not so simple really. The chefs Anatolian approach to his food is legendary. There is nothing to be scared of here.


Historically significant Anatolian/Mediterranean cooking.

Thank you chef!"}
{"text":"This place has great food, the only thing wrong is the set up. The menu is pretty unclear and the pricing as well, but the food is all authentic Turkish food and very good! Also it is really hard to find if it's your first time looking for it, you have to go into the steel tower and down an escalator then through some glass doors and down a long hallway. 

All in all very good food!"}
{"text":"Had an AWESOME lunch at the Istanbul Grille.  It was our first time visiting, and they put together a \"plate\" of food for me that allowed us to sample many of the menu items.  They were able to accommodate my GF restrictions.  The hospitality we encountered as first time visitors from another City was beyond extravagant.  you can bet I'll be back - and Josh please bring your business to Cincinnati!!!"}
{"text":"Blown away by Istanbul! Heard fantastic things from multiple people recently and finally tried it last week. There is so much to choose from it was a little overwhelming, so I asked the owner to help. He then proceeded to give me a little of most of their items... the highlights: meatballs, 3 bean salad, tomato cucumber salad, Greek salad, hummus, bulgar rice. The 2 people working were both so kind and helpful, and everything was delicious! Will definitely be back. The only suggestion I have is that they need to get rid of the old Keystone Cafe sign and put up their own."}
{"text":"Huge portions, good pricing, friendly service.  I really like this place.  No seating inside, but on a sunny day, great to pick up and sit in park next door."}
{"text":"This cafeteria style setup is putting out some really yummy food! I got the Meal #1 which features chicken and meatballs over bulgur and a salad with tzatziki (that white gyro sauce) as a dressing. The people serving the food seemed very pleasant and you certainly get a lot of food for your buck.  I'd eat here more often if only they accepted credit cards."}
{"text":"First time here and I loved it.  We came in during the lunch rush, but we didn't have to wait too long and the service was friendly as if it was mid-afternoon and quiet.  I got a chicken salad and the charming Turkish woman (totally assuming, but she seemed authentic!) hooked me up with eggplant, chick peas, and potatoes on top of my salad dressed with a creamy white yogurt dressing.

The best part was the potatoes and the eggplant.  They were flavorful, tender, and a perfect compliment to the crunchy lettuce.  The chick peas were nice and bright as well and a great counterpart to the \"heavier\" flavors.  The chicken would have been my favorite part in all of it's tender, juicy glory, but we had the bottom of the crock and some pieces were a little petrified (yknow, that crust that the edge of crock pots impart).  I would definitely return, though."}
{"text":"We had another great meal here last Friday and tried a few more delicious menu items. This restaurant has excellent prices for such tasty and fresh food. In case anyone is wondering, this restaurant is NOT at all affiliated with the other Turkish restaurant down the street at Forbes Ave. 

Well made food with quality ingredients, comfortable atmosphere, friendly wait staff, able to accommodate a variety of dietary preferences and restrictions, byob, excellent value. We tried the appetizer sampler and got to taste 10 items- all of them were delicious, as was all of the beef, lamb, and chicken on the mixed grille entree. There is no doubt that we will be back and can't wait to bring friends and family here with us."}
{"text":"Fresh, flavorful, and filling! Outstanding food and service. The gentleman in front of me today did not know it was cash only, and the owner told him he could pay double next time. This kind of service is what brings people back! Although I would come back even if the service was terrible, bc the food is outrageous. Currently my favorite lunch spot in Pgh. I love all the sides you get. The carrot slaw, cucumbers, hummus, chickpea salad, lentil salad, etc. all deserve to be on my platter. Well done!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Good sized portions. Price not too high. The lamb and rice very good. Hummus excellent!! The service was also excellent. I wish the spicy sauce had more bite to it but maybe that's what to expect with Turkish cuisine."}
{"text":"Four of us wandered into this restaurant with no knowledge that it was opening night! What a treat! Josh could not have been more accommodating and friendly. His sister gave us wonderful recommendations. The beef gyro was incredible! Everyone loved their dishes. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, food and service ! Can't wait to return. Josh and his team are personable and anxious to make their customers happy."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  I live nearby and I'm a huge fan of this place.  The owner is welcoming and generous."}
{"text":"These guys are great and the lamb / chicken wraps are outstanding.  I highly recommend paying them a visit.  The owner is super friendly as well."}
{"text":"Wow is this place adorable! The owners/family/employees are so nice, and it seems like the perfect type of family establishment. 

No menu, you just order a chicken salad, schwarma, chicken plate, meat plate, cold plate, etc and choose your items in the counter lineup. 

The chicken is so delicious, but they take some time to crisp it up more on the grill, so if you're in a rush you probably just want to get a cold plate or schwarma. Hummus is great, seasoning on the meat is great, hot sauce is great, tatziki is great. Cash only!"}
{"text":"Note: Istanbul Grille does accept credit cards, but their machine was down when I was there last week. More on that later...

After putting it off for too long, I went to IG for a breakfast of sorts.

When I strolled in and saw those vertical spits revolving, orange flames caressing the slightly blackened meat, I instinctively knew I would leave satisfied.

When I saw the owner/operator lavishly dress a simple salad with oil and vinegar and season it with a rainbow of spices, tossing and measuring the spices with tongs, I thought to myself, \"I chose my meal well.\"

My morning was made memorable with a chicken gyro salad that was centered around juicy, supple proteins, hearty grains, and tangy greens. My eyes being larger that my belly, I also couldn't resist adding some grape leaves, a salad of julienned carrot and yogurt, and...

\"Um. Could you put some Tzatziki sauce on the chicken as well?\"

\"What? You come to a Turkish restaurant and speak Greek to ME?\"

\"Oh, I'm sorry, I...\"

The man smiles to reveal the put-on, whispering to me, \"We call it Cack.\"

\"Ahhh.\"

\"You learned something today, eh?\"

The Turk-In-Charge insisted I pay after I ate my meal standing up in front of one of the counters that line the \"dining room\" (there is no seating). As I ate, a young woman placed a takeout order only to gasp when TIC mentioned that the credit card machine was not working.

\"I...have no cash.\"

\"Darling, pay me tomorrow. I trust, I trust.\"

Thankfully I had a ten-spot on me, and that's all I was charged for such a munificent styrofoam plate of grub. 

Go to Istanbul. Leave with a full stomach and a laughing heart."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.  The young man and young woman that waited in us provided one of the better dink g experiences I've had in a long time.  This might be one of the better meals I've had in the Pittsburgh area...all in a styrofoam container!  Meal #1 couple meats, some rice and salad.  Gyro meat was excellent and truly authentic.  Meatballs are turkey and beef, very flavorful and tender.  And the chicken was awesome as well.  Salad basic middle eastern salad.  White sauce...excellent. Hot sauce even better.   You pick whether you got or cold side.  Shredded beet salad was great.  A nice bite to it.  Basic but flavorful olives...and on the house.  This was an absolute Mecca of goodness and all in a styrofoam container.  All of this was suggested and prepared by the young gentleman that waited in us.  The pita gyro might have been one of the best. The wrap, although flavorful was there simply to hold together an absolute mound of gyro meat.  Adding white sauce and the hot sauce made it all the better.  Tres lesche cake.  Best I've ever had!  And the young man brought us soup on the house.  So simple, yet surprisingly flavorful.  This is an absolute must for any foodie out there!  Best Middle Eastern food in Pittsburgh and Cleveland, two cities which boast some pretty good food.  Thank you for a wonderful dining experience, plastic fork and all."}
{"text":"They always have many options from vegan, vegetarian, and meat. Always a safe go-to place fit lunch."}
{"text":"Wow sooo good! Chicken was perfectly marinated, crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside without frying it. The salad had a homemade dressing in it that was excellent and light.even the rice was well seasoned, and you so rarely see small businesses that actually take the time to make a side like rice a star of the dish, and not just a side filler on the plate."}
{"text":"If there was ever a business that I would point out as a 'model' for other businesses to follow, Istanbul Grille would be it, hands down! Josh was put out of his space on Liberty Avenue in October, for the expansion of 7-11 (like we need more of THAT!) but he has found a new space in the USX Tower food court! He is back, and the same amazing guy he always was, with the same amazing food!

First, their food is fresh, real, plentiful and absolutely delicious. Second, their prices are more than reasonable. And thirdly, and most importantly, their sense of customer service and 'hospitality' is as real and friendly as I have EVER seen in Pittsburgh - and they're from Turkey!

I'd been to two of their other locations, first when they were on Centre Avenue, and then after they'd moved to Lawrenceville, and both times, the staff and owner were so incredibly friendly, and the food, even though they'd had kitchen limitations, came out as a home cooked Turkish meal that was outstanding.

I tried the downtown lunch counter once after I'd started working downtown, and the thin and adorable guy behind the counter said 'first time?' I told him it was my first time at this location, and I ordered the 'meat' plate for the day. It came with their meat of the day, whatever is on the rotisserie (lamb or chicken) and he piled on the salads, the rice, some hummous, some hot sauce (which is more flavor than 'heat'), and a few other surprises. I don't even remember the price that day, but I had cash in my wallet, paid, and took it back to my office, and it was spectacular.

But my second visit was even more amazing. I saw the credit card stickers on the door, and didn't have cash in my wallet. I ordered the meat plate with a little extra hummous, and when I got the food, I noticed they didn't seem to have a credit card terminal. I asked the owner if they took cards. He said 'We don't take anything. Not even money. The food is free.' I smiled but said 'Seriously' because I didn't have cash. He said 'Don't worry, just bring it when you can'. I thanked him profusely, and then ran to my co-worker who was buying dreck food at Subway and borrowed cash, and returned immediately.

He looked at me when I walked in the door and said 'Why don't you listen to me? I didn't say run now, I said when you can!'  A lady, who I assume is his mom or aunt came over, and I asked what the total was, and she said 'ten'. I handed her the nine I'd borrowed from my friend, and reached for my wallet. 'That's good' she said. I insisted on giving her the other dollar from my wallet, and thanked them all again. And as I made my way to the door, the owner yelled out 'Hey! Get yourself a soda!' Oh, and did I mention there was a line of twenty people both times?

I didn't take a soda, but I was so moved by their genuine realness, that there are no worries - if I have cash, I WILL be back.

If some of the businesses serving up crap in town were this genuine and nice, I might spend money on their wares anyway. They should take a lesson from Istanbul.

And Istanbul, along with remarkable friendliness, serves up remarkable food. Clearly, a win-win situation.

An added bonus is that if you happen to be attracted to dark Middle-Eastern and Indian/Asian types, the line is almost TOTAL eye candy. I fell in love three times just waiting in line.

No bull, just total yum - at Istanbul! 

Visit the new space - they even have seating in the area!"}

{"text":"Fans of the Istanbul Grill in US Steel Building downtown can get the same delicious food and more for dinner, not just for lunch.  You will recognize both the staff and the food but you no longer have to eat from Styrofoam takeout containers using plastic utensils.  If you order the \"Little, Little Into the Middle\" for an appetizer, you will see many of the same items that you love.  It includes 9 items, Chef's Choice, but trust the Chef.  It is all wonderful.  For a main course, I had the Iskender.  It was huge.  An open face Gyro covered with tomato sauce with a side of yogurt.  I almost could not finish it but it was so good, I had to.  My companion ordered a Spring Salad.  She loved it.  We had the Three Milk Cake for dessert.  It is hard to describe.  Cake with flavored milk and caramel.  I don't know how it stays together but it works.  Service was good.  They are very friendly people who make you feel like family."}
{"text":"I tried a Turkish place in Houston.  Didn't like it.  But the food here, OMG. It's hard to figure out how to order - the menu, which consists of various platters each containing about three or four dishes - is posted on an out-of-the-way board opposite the food counter. That was annoying.  But the rotating salads are awesome, and the meat dishes just as good."}
{"text":"These guys moved from Liberty Avenue to the basement of the UPMC tower. Its still the same friendly Turkish guy with his awesome spread of cold and hot spreads. Pick and choose from the regular stuff and the daily specials.
His babaganous, hummus, boiled beet is one of the best along with his bulgar rice and the hot sauce. A must visit for you work lunch while in downtown (or even farther)"}
{"text":"If you love Mediterranean food or are in a mood to grab a takeout in downtown Pittsburgh, this is the place. As a vegetarian I love the cold-plate in which I can choose from amongst the assortment of dishes on display. My favorites are the spl hummus of the day, boiled n herbed beet, spinach n feta, flavored yogurt dips, grape leaves, tabouli ...(can go on and on). All these with their salad, rice and spicy sauce make a complete meal. The hot-plate has different vegetables everyday and the shawarma are really popular too.
It's best to have this lunch under the sun in nearby parks or in the eating area near the UPMC tower.
Note : Cash-only"}
{"text":"Cold plate = awesome plate.  Chicken gyro plate = take-out container of marinated awesome.  You should go here for lunch.

I have yet to try something here that I don't like.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is it's a bit disorganized, pricing seems somewhat scattered (thank God they finally have a menu...did it really need to take ~1 year?) and there's not an option to sit even if you wanted to...I hate eating at my desk (lunch = temporary freedom) and last I checked it's Pittsburgh, and outdoor dining is really only a good option ~20 days out of the year. (Okay, I know I'm exaggerating a bit...it's more like 10.)  

Also, because I end up going cold plate a lot, I'm left hungry after a few hours...and $7 for a Mike & Tony's food coma draws me in like a fat kid to a box of donuts."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try the Istanbul grill for quite some time since it had so many great reviews.  Unfortunately,  I was duped by the common misperception by Pittsburghers that large portions means the same thing as high quality.  I ordered a lamb pita to eat out on the plaza with a Jazz band playing.  Atmosphere = A+.  They were out of salad.  Seriously?  You can't send someone downstairs to the indoor location to get more?  At least they comped a drink, fine.  The pita comes overstuffed with meat.  A very hearty portion fir $8.  The guy serving it ia quite pleasant so I sit down and bite into it with anticipation of the flavors I read about in the reviews.  That's when it becomes a disappointment.  It wasn't bad per se.  I'd actually eat it again if I were with people who wanted to eat there.   But it wasn't actually good either.  Specifically,  the meat was cut way too thick.  And then after I asked for light onions and light hot sauce, he simply drenched it in (what I assume is) yogurt sauce without asking.  Way to much, yech.

I'm not expecting world class cuisine at a stand in Steel Plaza, but this is on par with an exceeding average gyro you can get all over the place.  There are at least a dozen places in the city that are much better for this type of food - though this may be as good as it gets downtown. 

If you want a very large portion of decent food for a reasonable price, this is your restaurant.   If you want above average, great tasting food, don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"I was SO SO SO excited that Istanbul Grill found a new home! It was heartbreaking when they were kicked out of their old space. But this felt like an adventure. If you don't work at the Steel Building, or you aren't familiar with the underbelly of the building like me, you might be completely lost. Especially if the security guard hasn't even heard of the business!

When finally found, it was pure joy! Although it doesn't look like they have quite the room or set-up they used to, I will admit it looks a little cleaner (which is a good thing). I was pumped to get my normal chicken salad with beets, white sauce and two grape leaves, all for $10 bucks! And the massive amount they give you, my lord, you could eat for two days!

Now, while it was still delicious, one thing I noticed was that my chicken had to be bottom of the barrel chicken. A lot of it was overcooked and too hard to even eat. Bummer. Why would I go back? Because I know it's still awesome and I'm crossing my fingers this was an \"off\" day. That's how much I love this place! Five star experience hopefully next time..."}
{"text":"I can't get enough! I'm hooked...

Obviously, because I keep dreaming about the flavorful food here! The first time I walked in I was pretty confused. I've never claimed to be an ethnic food expert, so looking at most of the food, I really had no clue what it was. But, the thing that helps me out is that I'll taste anything. It doesn't matter what it looks like, if it's food, I'm probably going to taste it. True fact.

So the guy, who I'm assuming is an owner or manager of some sort is nice enough to help me out. That was pretty much the only option I had, to trust him, considering there's literally no menu. None. 

So he hooks me up with every single thing they have in their food bins. Seriously, Everything. I ate for days! But every single thing was incredible. I wish I could tell you what it all was... so to best sum it up... I believe I sampled bubba ganache, hummus, chickpea salad and cucumbers in some sort of marinade. What I'm certain I had was salad, rice, chicken, beets and grape leaves. Even the grape leaves were excellent. i feel like I hadn't found some solid leaves until I tasted these. i loved that I could taste the lemon. Just bursting with flavor!

So he hooked me up for dinner, lunch and dinner again for $10 with a free drink! He said first time I get one free. i stopped in again today and had a solid meal, no surprise, and watched him give another first timer a free drink. I love great customer service!

I'm hooked, for realz."}
{"text":"The second location for the owner (Josh) of Istanbul Grille, after the one at USX. His food is always great, though it's a bit pricey for the quantity. I would come here almost 2-3 times a week. Reviewing it so other Yelpers can see the businesses 2nd location"}
{"text":"My first 10-star rating basically double the 5-stars. I want to eat like this every day. 

I ordered a meat meal of lamb with bulga rice a side of seasoned lentils, white beans and salad. Who knew lamb could be so juicy and tender??? The meal comes with two side vegetables. I had humus, finely shredded beet salad and seasoned garbanzo beans. All of this incredible food is placed in one container and topped with a spicy or mild sauce and a tzatziki type of sauce but better.

The restaurant is like Qdoba and others where you request the type of base (Meat or Veggie) then tell the person what sides and sauces you would like. You then take your food to go. For $10 - $11 you get MORE than your monies worth and the family gives warm friendly old school service with a smile which is rare. 

I absolutely love this place and wish there was one in Michigan near my home."}
{"text":"For a good bit of time I went to Istanbul. It was a terrific alternative to your typical meals because frankly they offer a good bit of variety for an extremely low price. 

Need to know items:

The chicken salad is your best bang for buck. Also fun fact, they marinate the chicken for 2 whole days prior to you seeing it, it's fantastic.

If it's your first time there and you are a vegetarian or just prefer no meat that day, order a \"cold plate\" Then make sure to mention it's your first time. If you are lucky they will load up your plate till it weighs about 1-2 lbs. Yes, you will receive what is equivalent to a small child.

It's a cash only place.

You can eat at a small booth their but I don't recommend it. Either take it back you where you work or to EQT plaza outside on a nice day. 

Now you may be wondering, well Nick..why did you stop going? Great question. Well it became what some may call an \"Addiction\" so I decided to ease up on the ole Istanbul gas pedal. If you've never been, go. Hands down recommend it if you work in the city. 

Also as a bonus fact: Try and get there after 11:45 otherwise the chicken most likely won't be ready and you will in fact be like \"dude why didn't you mention this\"  Now you can't say that."}
{"text":"Stopped for the first time last week and was blown away by the flavors and different food choices. The guy working was really helpful by telling me what his favorite foods were and assisting all around. I was so impressed with the food that I decided to stop back again today. I honestly can say that I didn't get the same service. The food was great, smallest imaginable portions this time around, and the younger woman working was not helpful at all. First she gave me the impression that just by me stopping, i was bothering her. She was miserable. None of the food is labeled, so of course, i have to ask what certain things are - no answer. The Meal combination options make no sense to me, so i ask a question - no answer. So for ten bucks i got half the amount of food that i got last week for $8. Wildly disappointed.  
Everything about the food at this place deserves five stars - even the guy that owns it (i believe he does); however, I know that as long as that girl is there, i won't be stopping. Sorry, friends."}
{"text":"This is an updated review for the new Istanbul Grill on South Braddock Ave.

The food here is delicious. There is nothing that is not wonderful. This is the type of restaurant that will make your day. The food is great. We had the mixed grill and all of the meats were great but the lamb chops were a blessing. They were the best lamb chops I've ever had. Expertly cooked, perfectly seasoned, and beautifully tender. You should eat these. Everything on the plate is wonderful and different from the food served in the downtown locations. They did keep all the same tappas, such as the hummus, bean salad and babba we all know and love. They have falafel and zucchini cakes too.

The best part of the experience is the owner Josh. Stay for tea."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Used to go here at least once a week when I worked in USS Tower. There was often a line at lunchtime; don't worry, it moves fast and the wait is worth it. Everything is homemade and seasoned so beautifully, right down to the side salad. Lots of vegetarian options, and meat is usually lamb or chicken. If you like a little kick with your food, the red pepper sauce is to die for. As everyone else mentioned, the staff is friendly and awesome. Sometimes the owner's mom was there and she is the sweetest lady ever."}
{"text":"Istanbul is full of friendly and attentive staff that honestly seem like they enjoy what they are doing. The food was fresh, hot and delicious.

It also helps that it won't bust your budget if you enjoy yourself and have an appetizer, dinner and desert.  Just don't forget your own wine.  This place is definitely on my list if I want to grab a quick dinner for take-out on my way home."}
{"text":"I am a carnivore, however, most of the time I visit I end up ordering meal 3.  I love to explore the side items for the salad.  Everything is so fresh, natural and tasty.  Even if you get something that might not go well on the first bite it tends to get better with the next.  The first couple of visits are a bit intimidating.  I think the reason is we like labels and descriptions on our food.  Sure, Josh will explain each item in great detail but if it is not labeled it doesn't register.  The items really aren't complicated, they are actually quite simple, but Josh works some magic and makes these ingredients work so well.  If you give it try, you will return several times."}
