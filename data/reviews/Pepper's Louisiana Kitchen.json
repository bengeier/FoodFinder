{"text":"Great new spot! Definitely a Mom and Pop restaurant but delivers with great customer service and the food is good as well.  My visit had a limited menu but the new full menu is coming very soon I was told.    I had the Catfish and Shrimp meal with Veggies. The shrimp and catfish were cooked perfectly!  The veggies could have been cooked a little longer as they were very crisp to the bite.  I am only giving 3 stars because I want to see more of a bigger menu !  I recommend trying it!"}
