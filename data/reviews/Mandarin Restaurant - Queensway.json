{"text":"Ate here last on December 23rd, 2012.  I visit this location a few times in a year, and was completely surprised that they served delicious lobster (chick size) thermidor that evening.  That was my highlight for the evening!  Pretty much devoured 3000 calories worth of lobsters that evening.

I go back to Mandarin at this location for their wide selection of both Asian (friend noodles and rice; sushi; mussels with black bean sauce, egg rolls, spring rolls, etc)  and Western savoury food (eg. roast beef, crab legs, salads,  fried chicken wings, chilled shrimps, deviled eggs, etc). Their dessert selection is pretty wide too - creme caramel, tapioca pudding, bread pudding, ice-cream, brownies, cookies, choclate dipped strawberry, seasonal fresh fruits, cakes, tarts, fried sugar balls, honey cruellers, etc.  Soft drinks have unlimited re-fills.  Mandarin has consistent attentive and friendly service. 

Hot towel service and fortune cookies are provided to all guests at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"I'm usually a sucker for all-you-can-eat buffets, and Mandarin certainly qualifies. It reminds me of the places I used to go to while on vacation in Florida way back when, and it's likely not coincidental that Mandarin appears to be popular with families and with Snowbirds who are up north for the summer.

This one follows the Mandarin template exactly: crappy exterior in a strip mall, semi-fancy dining hall on the inside staffed with eerily obsequious waiters. The food isn't quite gourmet, but it's still tasty, and they have a wide range of Chinese (and other international) dishes, so you're sure to find something to gorge yourself on. If you're on a budget, go for the lunch buffet, which is pretty much the same fare, only cheaper."}
{"text":"Nice Restaurant,excellent service call before you go. saves time and good food always :)"}
{"text":"Great part of a great neighbourhood!! I used to be of the opinion that 'you've seen one Mandarin, you've them all', but I've been going to quite a few locations recently because my job is taking me more on the road than in the office. I agree with previous posters; service is amazing. They even have management on the floor."}
{"text":"Ordered in, and the delivery man was miserable and scowling. Never even thanked me for my tip! I ordered the combo plate with sweet and sour ribs which were nothing but fat and cartilage a totally inedible. I not only spoke to the manager, but also left two messages at head office. I never got an apology or even an acknowledgement of the problem. With so many Chinese restaurants to choose from, I will never order from Mandarin again. No accountability nor quality of food or service. So disappointed"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for 10 or some years now.
We have visited 2 other Mandarin's but we find this is one of Toronto's cleanest and well kept ones. They keep the buffet fully stocked even when it's crowded which is quite impressive. The waiters and waitress are always smiling and keeping the drinks filled up when we sneak off to grab more food.  I'm only giving 3 stars as i feel the washrooms are a little unkept ."}
{"text":"I used to be a big fan of Mandarin and the great \"variety\" of food they offered. I say variety because their choice of food is not in fact varied, just one fried, greasy and/or overly sauced item after another. However, the choice of food does not exactly surprise me, simply because this kind of food is made to cater to the average Canadian, not someone looking for actual authentic and delicious Chinese food.

Ironically, after visiting the Mandarin for their Canada Day free buffet special, I have never felt more disgusted and appalled to call myself a Canadian. I was a fool to think that the staff would be willing to create an enjoyable experience for me and my friends. After waiting a good two hours in line, it was only at the door that we were informed that only 4 of the 8 of us would be allowed entrance by what I assumed was the manager who himself had no semblance of proper etiquette and good manners.

All of this was because we had no idea we apparently required the fans they were giving out to be granted access. As one would assume without being told otherwise, a fan is to be used to cool oneself off on a hot day waiting in line. However seeing as these fans served no practical purpose, we decided to not bother grabbing these fans.

To further mar the experience, we were forced to suffer the never-ending, condescending wrath of the absolutely grumpiest elderly woman I have ever had the displeasure of speaking to in my life. All of this was because she felt absolutely infuriated by having my friend and I reserve a spot in line for the rest of our friends, who arrived only 20-30 minutes later, and still had to wait an entire hour and a half before.

The only thing that stopped me from giving a 1-star review was the extremely lax staff present, because hell, if you can't beat them, join them. Thank you Mandarin for not noticing your food being smuggled out to customers who were denied entrance. Customers who smuggled the very same guilt ridden food they were eating, dripping not with grease, but pure anger and hatred.

If anything Canada Day taught me this year, it is that no matter how prosperous and accepting our society is, when it comes to free food, people will go to great lengths to exploit a good things purely for themselves."}
{"text":"Food quality very good (although variety falls a tad short), prices fairly decent, customer service very friendly.

I've been to this venue a number of times, and the last time I was there about a week ago, I found that the variety of the food just wasn't quite there.

However the food that they did have was very fresh, tasty, and flavourful.

The staff was friendly in greeting everyone, and we were thanked on our way our, and also given a dinner mint for our trip back to the office.

With that in-mind, I would likely return to this venue within the next year, as I wasn't overly impressed with the selection."}
{"text":"Any Mandarin has got to be the best all you can eat buffet restaurant in town. They have so many choices even delicious fish & chips and now clam chowder too. I wish I lived beside the Mandarin, I would never have to cook again"}
{"text":"Mediocre food. It's a buffet though so I'm unsure what you would expect. But let's skip over the food for a bit and talk about the service.

We wanted to go to Mandarin after my grandfather's funeral. My family is freaking huge because gramps had a lot of kids. Like double digits. We knew there was going to be a lot of people after the funeral because gramps knew so many people and was well respected in the community.

So we called a week before the funeral and the girl on the phone was like \"Yeah we don't take any reservations,\" and I get that because they want to make the most business they can. Well obviously they must take some reservations because my family members have done reservations for company functions. We didn't know how many people would be there, but we knew there would be over 100 people, so we told the girl that and she said she would \"make a note of it.\"

So after grampa's funeral, we were emotionally wrung out and wanted to go to Mandarin. My aunt called before we left, and they still didn't know that we were coming. Okay, my aunt is probably not the best person to call, but honestly, the girl didn't even tell any of her co-workers we were coming. She called in sick to work that day.

So they all scrambled to open up rooms during opening. They weren't prepared. It took an hour for people to get seated. Yes we were WAY over 100 people, and of course we wouldn't know how many people would've went. There were 214 that went to celebrate the life of grandpa, and I was not pleased with the way they handled everything in terms of the reservations. 

If it weren't that grandpa really liked Mandarin, we would have chosen another establishment. 

The workers scrambled to find seats, and make food fast enough for the family. I thought the waiters and busboys were great, dealing with the unusual amount of volume at the beginning of their shift, but the girl on the phone? No. If she told someone before hand then maybe they could have brought in more people to work the shift. The food was mostly out for the first hour, and the food looked messy, because no one was prepared for how many people there were.

Mandarin, something's gotta change about this group reservation thing, or at least train your phone operators better."}
{"text":"Another great experience at mandarin.  Great staff - even a little too friendly- because I end up saying hello 3-4 times to the same waiters over and over to a point I wished they made an effort to remember my face... So their efforts to stay friendly seems somewhat forced BUT I still enjoy coming here and the food is great !!"}
{"text":"Well if you've been to one Mandarin, you've been to them all.  BUT...this one is different.  The experience itself really turned my gf and I off.  OK I remember the greetings of \"Welcome to Mandarin.\"  But I think I must've heard it about 10 times between the time I walked in to the time I got to my table.  They had servers circling around like wasps ready to replenish your water and napkins.  It was totally annoying.  I guess the workers resemble the ethic of a Chinese sweat shop. Then when we left we had people asking us to come back again.  Please tell me who their marketing person is because it gets annoying and will never make me go back there AGAIN."}
{"text":"The service was discriminatory. I was with a friend looking for a meal on Easter weekend and they refused to give us a table because we did not have a reservation.
The next people who entered were a family without a reservation and yes, they got in.
Please don't tell me that it was based on skin color..."}
{"text":"This place has BUGS. I saw on one the wall when eating and killed it and reported it to the manager. Got my meal free however i will not be going back."}
{"text":"Someday a looooooong time ago, Mandarin rubbed me the wrong way. I haven't stepped into a Mandarin for over a decade! 

Just the other weekend, I was forced to go here for a celebratory occasion. 

However... 

Mandarin is now, no longer on my hate list. 
It is now on my aiight list and (I guess) I will no longer persuade others to make an alternate restaurant decision should Mandarin be their top choice. 

I surprisingly enjoyed my dinner here and unbelievably helped myself to seconds. Concentrating on the deep fried shrimp. 

I am still confused why there's a roast beef station? There's no way someone can be fooled that roast beef is Chinese food! Right? 

Mandarin, I know buffets are suppose to offer an ample selection, but it's okay to stick to one theme."}
{"text":"My only regret at Mandarin is not having a second stomach.

Place is clean, food is good, service is fast. No complaints about this location.

Love Mandarin... it's my go to when I have no idea of what to eat."}
{"text":"This restaurant is truly epic. I come to Toronto a couple times a year to visit family, and we go to Mandarin often. We always love how every single staff member that greets you says \"Welcome to Mandarin!\" very, very quickly. 

This is one of the biggest Chinese buffets I have ever seen, and the food is delicious and well prepared. A couple of times I have made my way up there for their Dumpling Festival, which usually coincides with Chinese New Year, and boy is that delectable! The display of the food is also gorgeous, and it has the best sushi at a Chinese buffet I've ever had.

The one docked star is because it is missing my all time favorite buffet food: Lo Mein. They have these thinner, harder, less saucy (and probably better for you) noodles, of which I forget their name. Get some lo mein and you'll be perfect in my book.

{"text":"My friends love this clean location and have been coming here for over 15 years.  I've joined them on a few occasions for the AYCE venue.

The food is great, the service staff is excellent and there is something at the buffet to satisfy everyone; vegetarians, meat lovers, Sushi lovers,  seafood regulars, etc.

Desserts are also plentiful to fulfill that urge!

Parking is free and reservations are recommended.

Check meal prices vary depending when you want to dine!  Discount available for Seniors 65+ years of age."}
{"text":"I've celebrated my cousin's birthday here and the quality was awesome, the noise level wasn't very loud, the food was delicious, and the servers were very nice.

I completely recommend to celebrate birthdays here if you want Chinese food. Or, just a normal dinner. You'll expect the food being really tasty. Just saying, you'll walk out being happy."}
{"text":"Great food with good atmosphere and good service. Been to many buffets but this one is still the best. Might be a bit pricey for dinner but totally worth it."}
{"text":"You know what to expect if you've been to Mandarin, all locations carry the same items, have the same prices etc. 

The service here however is much much better. The managers are around all the time, now I would hate to work in a place like this but it beats having to get your waitresses attention. They will top up your water even if you just had a sip, clean your table up quickly and get you fresh napkins. 
Now the buffet table is attended to just the same, no mess or spills no missing items. 

I always suggest this particular location out of the rest. Always make reservations(required an hour or 2 before your expected arrival) or else be prepared for 30-40 min wait. 

*They don't accept interact but they have an ATM on location, but it's not always in working condition."}
{"text":"Every single staff member smiled and offered assistance everywhere I turned! 

The whole place was clean and was run like a well oiled machine! As new food was brought out, new plates filled the buffet tables, and as people left, the tables we cleaned all through an intricate ballet! 

With the variety of food, you would be hard pressed to not find something to eat. 

The desserts were plentiful as well (see the pictures)!

Even the managing partner of the location Jesse Ali came to our table to check on us! Granted he checked in all the other table store so I'm not as important as I think I am!!

In any case this place is well worth the visit, especially with the family! 

Thank you Mandarin buffet!"}
{"text":"Service - 5/5
Food quality & taste - 3/5
Food selection - 4/5
Cleanliness - 4/5

The service is great.  From the starter hostess at the door, to the person leading you to your table, to the waiter and even the manager comes around to greet everyone and give you his business card.  All the staff always has smiles on their faces are are very eager to help.   The staff is very quick to take completed plates off your table and to return to see if you need anything else.  My water glass was always full.

I also love the warm towels they give you before and after the meal.  

The food itself is ok for an All You Can Eat place.  But if you are going with a big group, this place is great to give everyone at least something they will like.  You can go back up as many times that you want. 

We went for a birthday and if you sign up online, you can get a free dinner as long as you bring in 3 other guests which we did.  They even came over to take our picture and returned to us later with the printed picture in a magnet to take home as a keep sake.  I thought that this was really nice."}
{"text":"The variety of food was not bad. Came on a Wednesday and even then it seemed that when an item went low they were quick to replenish.  Oddly enough, I really enjoyed their rib roast and they make delicious yorkshire pudding that didn't immediately go all gloopy  and soggy on you when you poured the au jus or gravy into it. 

They had an impressive variety of sushi available but the other hot dishes seemed a little lacking. Dessert area had again a myriad of choices but again fell short when it came to quality and taste. I liked the wall of ice cream choices and the only desert I thought was good was their bread pudding with vanilla sauce. 

The food, ambiance and cleanliness of the space would get 3/3.5 even, what knocked off points though was their audacity to try and charge an automatic 18% gratuity for a buffet!!

Good enough place for an one time try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I love Mandarin! I have been here for my birthday last year and this year. I loved every part of it!!! My birthday is during Lunar New Year which means I have extra food options. Yesterday they had a huge salmon!!! The staff members are very efficient. Anybody who talks to you or sees you in one of their many dining rooms always says \"Welcome to Mandarin\". They give you a hot towel before and after your meal. There is a LOT of food available, and not just Chinese food! There are salads and pastas and many wonderful desserts to feast on!!! The food is always fresh and delicious. Upon exiting, you will be given a mint in hand. Mandarin is always busy. Make a reservation if you plan to go. I will come back here for my birthday until I die!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is incredibly mediocre to plain bad.
Worst of all; way overpriced, just to expensive!  Depressing place.
The wait staff seem forced to be overly friendly-fake, it's awkward.
I pretty much can't stand Mandarin, but once a year I get weak and go, and then re-wonder 'why'???"}
{"text":"I love the buffet style service rather than the a la carte service.  

Service style:  The waiters are very nice and friendly, but I feel awkward when they take your plates whenever you turn your head.  I never understood the hot towels but it's an overall good place to eat.  

Food:  Very delicious but I wanted to eat all of it but I couldn't so I feel that I should take a tiny piece of everything next time I eat there, so that I tried all the stuff.  It's a very good thing when you leave the restaurant and you puke even though you didn't make it to the bus stop yet..."}
{"text":"A once in a while guilty pleasure. The dining equivalent of the feedbag. Loads of food, loads of variety, always something surprising. Quantity over quality but then there are times when you'd rather have 4 Shermans versus one Panther. The buffet can get pretty busy on weekends and prices are high on weekend nights. That's probably a good thing or I might dine here every weekend."}
{"text":"Moved into the area a couple months ago and glad to see there is one close by. Everyone already knows what to expect from mandarin by now so, all in all I have had great service from this place and quick takeout, happy with this location and service :)"}
{"text":"How do you know if a Chinese restaurant is amazing? There's alot of Chinese people eating at the restaurant. You're not gonna see that here!

When you're too lazy to cook or hosting a big party that is the only time I recommend you come here.All the mandarins could use an update in general the decor is starting o get old and boring.

Food mostly caters to the Canadian customers, with a combination of deep fried goodness mixed with a little bit of Chinese. I say a little bit b/c 90% of the dishes you will never see in China.

A few tips, always make a reservation regardless if it's a weekday or weekend. If you like sashimi and it's dinner time ask the sushi bar to get you some pieces, they don't showcase it but it's one of their off the menu items.

Items to definitely get
- salt and pepper shrimp 
- grilled chicken
- grilled steak
- sashimi (dinner time)
- crab legs (seasonal)
- lobster (seasonal)"}
{"text":"Everything i had for dinner tonight was delicious. The place was very clean and the staff was friendly. There were a ton of different options. Id love to know if anyone knows where i can get the pink mints they give you when you leave."}
{"text":"Yum and yum oh and yes double yum. Does that sum it up?! I go often. Expensive dinner but worth it... Lobster legs... Ummmm."}
{"text":"Good buffet with a lot of options. Salad selection had mayo on most of the things. My favorite was the salmon and the onion salad.
Everyone was very nice. Smiles on their faces and very attentive to you. 
The decor was nice as well and seems like a clean place with fresh food."}
{"text":"Except for a very edgy server, this Mandarin is great for food and service. The atmosphere is cool too. Will be back when Im in Etobicoke."}
{"text":"Positives: 
* Very friendly and fast servers. 
* Clean
* Variety of choices available on the buffet

Negatives:
* Mostly fried & greasy food on the buffet
* Mediocre food. Nothing is really outstanding or worth going back for seconds. 

Would I try it again? Probably not. I'd rather have a small portion of really excellent food over a large portion of blah."}
{"text":"Let me tell you - there is a joy in life that can only be felt by eating thin-crust pizza, slathered in sweet and sour sauce.  And that's a joy that I doubt you'll find anywhere outside of the Mandarin.

This location is pretty straight forward - and though it looks small from the outside, it's just as well stocked as you'd expect.  And, maybe it's because I was seating right at noon while the food was being put out, but the ribs?  Just as good as the all you can eat variety from any bigger chain that offers that deal.  To be fair, they were a little tough, but I prefer to rip my flesh from the bone, rather than have it fall off.  So, to each their own.

The staff were very lovely.  I had my five month old baby present, and everyone working came by to ohh and ahh.  He was the star of the show!  Not only that, but this is a great place to eat if you have a baby, because it's so busy and loud anyway that your cooing child won't make that big a disturbance.

The only question I have is, when did they change their after-meal mints from green to pink?  That's ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Everything there is tasty. So nice and very clean location. I like Sushi and seafood. You won't be regret at all."}
{"text":"I always enjoy my dining experience at this location and I will gladly admit that I frequent this place with family and friends. 

First and foremost I have to say that the service is impeccable here, the greeting at every corner as your guided to your seat past the delicious, piping hot food is a nice touch I think.  I have heard complaints about the repetitiveness of this style of customer service, I will contend that they still do not recognize me and I practically live there! But still I find this method of customer service more consistant and inviting then most I have seen.

I find the cutlery and tables always clean considering it is a high volume buffet style restaurant and there is plenty of space unless you hit the super busy times but the wait has never been more then 20min in my experience. Even though I am generally not a big fan of family restaurants for some reason I am more tolerant here, almost expecting the odd child to dart past but the convience, selection and quality of the food more then makes up for any short comings. .

The buffet has an excellent selection with many seasonal specials and feature dishes but all the food is consistant in taste and quality, not everything is to my personal preference but the dishes I do enjoy I really love! Some personal fav's of mine...  their wonton soup, (surimi) seafood salad, tornado shrimp rolls, prime rib, deep fried honey twists and chocolate dipped strawberries. I am also quite fond of their coffee as well, it seems to always be fresh and rich, complimenting their desserts perfectly which by the way they have a large selection of.

If you've read any of my other reviews you'll probably hear me yammering on about parking because it is an important thing for me. Here they always have ample parking as they not only have their own private lot but they are joined with a very large parking lot for a nearby plaza/mall so your bound to find a space at any time.

Almost every Mandarin I have been to I have enjoyed my experience but I feel this location is something special; they really extend the greatest amount of effort for the guest making the experience exceptional and consistant."}
{"text":"Just ate lunch at Mandarin for the first time and really enjoyed it. 
I don't know why people hate on Mandarin....I mean, you get what you pay for. It's unlimited reasonable quality food, for a reasonable price. A lot of people in Canada seem so price sensitive...like anything over $20pp is too expensive if you aren't 'fine dining'. In Sydney, Australia (where I'm from) you couldn't get all you can eat ANYTHING for under $45pp. 
Anyway...The food here is pretty good as far as Canadian Chinese food goes...it was all very fresh and tasty. I wouldn't say it was authentic Chinese food by any stretch of the imagination....it's most definitely westernised food....but that doesn't mean it's still not good tasting food. There were fresh shrimp & mussels, standard Chinese food, sushi, and non asian options such as pizza and flank steak, mash & veggies. 
My only complaint would be that some of the dishes that have a sweet element to them go too hard on the sweet (honey garlic chicken wings kind of tasted like they could have passed as candy). 
Service was very friendly, welcoming and attentive. Sure, some may see it as forced....but I'd rather that then the lacklustre apathetic service I receive at a lot of Toronto restaurants. 
The decor and general ambience....it reminds me of every authentic Chinese restaurant I've ever been to. Which is to say - they look like they haven't been updated since the 80's or 90's when they were first built. I like that...true to their roots. Have you ever eaten in China? Because majority of the places kind of look like that. 
Overall...it's an all you can eat family style restaurant....for only $25pp you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Typical Chinese buffet at twice the price of what you would pay most places.  Relatively clean.  Good service.  Good selection of food.  But, all and all just average."}
{"text":"Service:
They are very hard working, they will refill your water continuously, clean your plates...  Half of the staff does not speak very good english (they know just enough to get you to your seat, and ask you for drinks) and are very attentive (to the point where it gets annoying).  They are constantly hovering over you refilling your water, not always giving you time to talk with the people who you came with.

Food:
There is tons of variety for everyone.  
They have multiple tables: 1 large table for salads, 1 small table with soups and break, 2 large tables with all types of food, 2 large desert/fruit table, ice cream table, and 1 semi a la carte grill - they make sausages, grilled chicken, garlic break, sushi, roasts.  

Large variety of food, keeps adapting to the marketing. They recently added sushi stand as well.  The food is very westernized.  Lots of sauces...  The quality of the food is ok.  Nothing special, but it will not make you sick (unless you eat too much).

The waffles are likely the best part and a must not miss part.


Ambience:
Very loud atmosphere, constant shuffling, kids running around, happy birthday songs being sung...  There are usually a few big celebrations which will take half of a room, and they get to be loud. 

Cost: The cost is pretty high for the quality of food you are getting.  If you are into Japanese/Thai food I would recommend Spoon and Fork across the street.  

Final Suggestions:
- go if you want a large variety of food but are not too pick about quality.
- good for really large groups
- waiters can get annoying, so if you want to have a private or important conversation this is not the place."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and was very disappointed with the quality. The lemon chicken was the worse i've ever had. 
Not going back there for american Chinese."}
{"text":"This is my favorite buffet hands down. Always fresh food and a top notch drink menu. My favorite time to come is during the moon festival. This location has been established for quite sometime. I strongly encourage you to try some of the many seasonal drink offerings. ( As most of them are very good !). On holidays it can get busy so book ahead when possible. I honestly cant find anything wrong with any of the dishes. These guys set the bar when it comes to buffets. Thank you for many years of great service. Keep it up."}
{"text":"Sister Sarah and I had supper at the Mandarin.  It's been a lot of years since I've been (great idea, Sis!).

There's a lot of choice ... over 150 dishes ... and not just Chinese food.

Sister Sarah started off with shrimp, crab and lobster au gratin (that was a big hit).  I'm not a fan of seafood.  Everything I had was good and yes, I was FULL!

The staff were very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I have come around on Mandarin....
i went a few times to the big one in Brampton just off the 410 during lunch and always felt like garbage after. Might just be from going at lunch and the food isnt as fresh.

But I have been to this location twice on super busy nights (one being Christmas Eve) and the food was good! I went back for spicy chicken several times. We also came during dumpling festival and loaded up several times.

I wish there was a way you can have them not talk to you so much lol
just let me overeat in peace! I dont need the hostess chatting with me and the manager coming by and putting his card at the table. 

Foodwise though, i think the best recommendation is to go when it is semi-busy so you know it is fresh."}
{"text":"This place is without a doubt one of the if not the best Mandarin restaurant in town. They operate like no other. Costumer service is so good, they always compliment you and acknowledge you when and if you need something. I'm glad I came here, it's like no other experience. Trust me and go eat here."}
{"text":"So...the mandarin is what you'd expect from a giant chain buffet. Plenty of options from Chicken Balls, to Sushi. The food is good considering the massive amounts of it they put out daily to serve an almost always packed restaurant. 

Room C however has a bad smell to it. So if possible, if making your reservation, ask for any room but. Also, in the C section last week we had to ask for our drinks twice, which in my at least 20 visits prior...in every other section than this hasn't happened. 

Its about 30$ per person on weekends/holidays, which is a little pricey, so make sure you come hungry and eat as much prime rib and crab legs as you can to make up the price."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner on a Monday. We were quite early since we were super hungry. We waited until 4:30 then were seating in the dining hall. 

The food is good. The same as with every other fast food chain. What really bothered me was their service. Sure checking up on people here and there is good but EVERY 5 MINUTES is absurd. It got to a point that I couldn't even enjoy my food because I was being haggled. The servers don't even speak proper English which made the experience even that much more worse. 

I'd go back but can the servers please drop breathing down our necks?"}
{"text":"The dining in experience is far superior to the take-out version... I ordered a combo for 1 where no substitutions are allowed even for religious dietary restrictions which I found quite frustrating... 

Combo 201B includes fried rice, chicken balls beef with almonds and an egg roll 

***** when ordering takeout it should be a NO-brainer to include cutlery... how is one supposed to eat rice and beef without? ******** 

-the beef with almonds was rubbery and scarce as the portion was almost entirely large pieces of barely cooked green peppers

-chicken balls were satisfactory, rice was a few days old and pretty lacklustre 

Overall a very poor experience not worth the physical drive and the 12$ price tag... will NOT be taking out again"}
{"text":"I celebrated my brother's birthday at this restaurant. This is a great Mandarin location, the manager (Michael?) is very friendly, he comes around and welcomes you. The food is tasty and there are so many food options to choose from. I find the chicken balls, breaded shrimp and waffles delicious. The service is outstanding. A great dinner had by all."}
{"text":"3.5
Pretty decent buffet, especially the salad bar and crab legs. The sushi and other hot item bars are less interesting, and for a final bill of 35 per persons, you really want to be very hungry to eat there. Service is OK, though some of the waitress really do the minimum.
Hence, as long as we don't have Casinos in Toronto with huge buffets like in Las Vegas, this place can do it..."}
{"text":"OK I thought I loved Erin mills, but this is even better!  They had many dessert options I've never seen before, and I've been to at least six Mandarins!  Wait staff are excellent as always, and lots of selection. Wish they would have some basic dim sum all year round!  And the butternut squash soup, which is only around for Moon Festival, is incredible!   One tip for any buffet, only grab food when its very full so it's always hot and fresh.  Yes, you're welcome!"}
{"text":"I quite often went to mandarin.  I went to different places from Kitchener, two different place in Brampton, two different place in Mississauga and also in Toronto. 
Today I stop by in Queenway to have lunch. They put me on room C.  The room is bit updated and I feel the room small... 
I start look around for start my lunch. I went to appetizers but I didn't see the devil egg, I just see regular hard boil egg... Normally I will start my lunch/dinner at Mandarin with devil egg.
Instead they have roast beef they have BBQ pork. For the taste... I don't like it, they have after taste.
The dessert I took a waffle,  I like waffle from Mandarins they have soft and fluffy waffle but today they waffle not soft but hard and after pouring them with vanilla sauce and dipping it on melt ice cream the waffle crunchy... Not soft at all.
The staff is OK but seem like over doing it. Why they have to loud voice to welcome the new customer who just coming?
Today is not my happy day for lunch in Mandarin."}

{"text":"We went here for Christmas dinner since it's just the four of us.  The food was excellent and the selection perfect for my picky daughter.  Our server, Margaret, was friendly and attentive.  

I just have one suggestion: make a reservation.  If you don't, you could be waiting a while. We made one and got right in."}
{"text":"this is the worst mandarian i've ever had the chance of eating at. 
none of the servers got my drink right 
the inside hasn't been renovated in a really long time... 
the food was plain and not the same standard as normal mandarians...
never again"}
