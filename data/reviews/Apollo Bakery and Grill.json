{"text":"Great food for very low prices. Clean and neat and the staff is very friendly! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. We went in a group of three. I ordered a chicken shawarma. Chicken is tender and juicy. Service is great. Place is clean. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I tried the kebab plate and the shish tawook chicken plate,I didn't like the meat and the chicken was not marinated properly ,for me this is not the place to go for grills,definitely this place is overrated or I just went for the wrong menu items !!!  Management very welcoming and place has nice ambience."}
{"text":"Restaurant was nicely decorated and clean. Went with some friends and a little baby. They did have a sturdy high chair for the baby so that was great. Food was decent too. Fries were very fresh!! They d good fries. Ordered zattar bread. It was quite tasty. Also had chicken shwarma authentic lover. It looked small but it was quite filling. Generally a good place."}
{"text":"Valentine's brunch at Apollo. Ordered taboulleh, generous serving but on the sour side. Not enough bulgur. Felafel plate was very good; perfectly fried and great presentation. Kibbeh was good too. Restaurant is clean and our server from Albania was attentive. The only complaint I have is the music which was from the 60s. The place could use some soft Arabic music since Apollo is the god of music."}
{"text":"Comfy seating area with nice touches to the decor. Manakeesh were nice and baked in front of you. This is a Syrain restaurant, their shawarmas were more moist than usual, but it is delicious. Worth a visit, could take a date as well."}
{"text":"Falafel is really good. The ambience is nice and cozy Good food but very slow service."}
{"text":"Maybe the food is good but the service is the worst. I went today with my husband and just waiting 10min then I went to ask the server said she will be with us in a minute after 10min she came and said what you guys want ..... ehmmm first of all bring the menu then we can tell you....so then... after 5min she bring the menu then we wanted to give order we waited another 10min she didn't came at all so we left the place and btw I forgot to say the place was empty!!! So wasted 35min at this nonsense place if I could I would give zero stars for the service"}
{"text":"Food: Beautiful presentation of food while not compromising on serving sizes  Delicious salads Really good hummus Fries as expected Lamb chops were a bit dry and I didn't love the marination Got the mix platter for 4-5 people but it was more than enough for 7 people  Unlimited homemade pita bread Food was overall great but chefs need to come up with in house hot sauce and stop serving tobacco sauce as their hot sauce!! Also would be awesome if they start serving garlic sauce or tahini with their platters :)  Ambiance: Clean and modern space, pretty open. Would feel comfortable bringing guests here  Service: Casual/ friendly and pretty quick!   3.5 stars and would come again :):)"}
{"text":"Great food. Good quick service. Clean and inviting.  Had the mixed grill and manakeesh. Garlic and hot sauces were fresh and very tasty. Definitely a place to check out! Try the Turkish coffee!"}
{"text":"3.5  Pros: - Beautiful place,  very modern - quick service  - make their own bread  Cons: - Have to order at the table if your dining in and tip,  unlike many other shawarma places - chicken was a bit dry - shawarma diner doesn't come with hummus,  only wanted a little on the side and had to order a whole hummus  - store bought hot sause - water is u drinkable,  tastes like chlorine"}
{"text":"The salads are good, the fact that they put pomegranate sauce with everything makes everything taste better. Yet this restaurant is overpriced for what you're getting. I had their \"authentic shawarma\" the other day and it probably was the greasiest sandwich I've ever had in my life, definitely greaser than the shawarma I've had in Syria, Jordan, Turkey and here in Canada.  It's alright overall but expect to overpay for average food."}
{"text":"I've been in many Mediterranean cuisine .. this is the most welcome and comfy atmosphere. Their staff were very welcome .. very attentive to hear any comments. We've even got more Falafel as complementary for the positive comments . Their Zaater Manakesh is ooooooohh waaawo dough texture , thickness and zaater spread is very excellent !! Hummas was good in taste not the best but good. Their presentation is clean and nice. I would definitely recommend and visit again.  Waiting for their grand opening!"}
{"text":"Very clean place. Very odd for a middle eastern restaurant. The server seemed friendly The server made the table within a minute of other guests leaving the place The server gave us the menus upon seating The server came within 5 minutes to take our order  And now the food. The menu appears very similar to Paramount The prices are kept similar to Paramount The food presentation is amazing  The quantity could Maybe improved The food quality is great. They use a lot of tenderiser to keep the meat chewable  Washrooms are clean All supplies are refilled properly The maintenance schedule posted in th3 washroom had not been updated by staff but still the washrooms were clean.  Message to management: Keep up the good work. I don't want to see this new idea going down the drain  5 star from me"}
{"text":"I went there with some friends it's good for small gathering ,The food is good , price is good , clean place , I like there hummus and falafel."}
{"text":"It was good but it wasn't 5 stars as was the overall rating for this place when I decided to go. The pita bread was fresh and delicious, and the kibbeh was pretty good. However order the shish taok over the chicken shawarma plate because the chicken shawarma chicken was very dry which is essentially the reason this isn't a 4 star review. The same can be said about the rice. It's a decent place to come to if you're in the neighborhood but don't go out of your way to come here as there are better middle Eastern places in Mississauga."}
{"text":"The only pro about this place is the ambiance (modern, clean and family friendly).   Bad service. We had to wave at our server to order because she was busy talking to another server. Once we got our food, we had to ask for cutleries (not surprised). My bf ordered chicken shawarma plate, and I got a regular chicken shwarma wrap. Chicken was bland and dry. Not a single component from the plate/wrap stood out.   Will we be back? No. I have had much better shwarma in the GTA. They might not be as modern as this place, but their food was more memorable."}
{"text":"So with the over saturated area of middle eastern food these days, it's often hit and miss to find a truly authentic and good place. As I used to go to A now major chain restaurant (I won't use names for Ethical reasons), I find that since franchising the food not up to par and tasting more processed rather than fresh ingredients.   Not so with this place that just soft opened. This is the second Syrian place to pop up in Mississauga and let me tell you, the Syrians know how to make good nay GREAT food!   The bread oven where they make the pita is so perfect! The bread is not to sweet, not too thick and perfectly cooked! My favourite thing is that they make all the classic Arabic dishes I grew up eating. Foul, Fatteh, and even desserts! All made in house no second party needed to bring it in like some other joints.   The stuffed vine leaves are HAND ROLLED, that's right folks no canned stuff here and don't even get me started on the falafel which are in the sale of donuts so that they're perfectly crispy all the way through! My biggest complaint at some places!   I highly recommend you try them out! I was told they also will be doing breakfast options. Either way this place is the real deal! Let's hope it stays that way! Since I've been 2 times in two days ha ha!"}
{"text":"Halal meat is served here per verbal assurance from owners. Very nice interiors and decor. Friendly staff. Food is presented nicely as well. Tried the kofta platter which was very good as well as the sausages appetizer (they were ok). Prices are very reasonable. Will have to come back again to try some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"I had chicken shawarma sandwich food. Chicken undercooked and the sandwich very oily."}
{"text":"Good food... nice ambiance... clean.   We have been there few times. Always found the quality of the food great, nice servings, good staff and clean environment. Definitely a good place to keep in shortlist. Their Falafel is the best among several other places we tried."}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant twice before I chose to give it a review. The verdict? As advertised. If you are looking to try a Syrian style cuisine at a reasonable price..this is the place to do it. I really hope they maintain the service, quality and $$$ and this place will do really well.  Pros: Very clean resto, super friendly management which gives you that \"back home\" feel, the menu definitely has a \"Syrian flavour\" to it, lots of items on the menu, the wait time to receive the food was appropriate, servers are very tentative. Food-wise, the mixed grill was absolutely delicious as was the authentic chicken shawarma sandwich. Hummus and Fatteh were on point as were the manakeesh, and for anyone who usually dreads ordering fries on the side...order a side of fries here.  Cons: Not too much here, to be fair the beef shawarma i got was a little cold but thats about the only con I had."}
{"text":"This place is a very elegant spot. The mixed grill, falafel and hummus is awesome. The  service was very warm and welcoming. Definitely a family dinner spot. You gotta try this place."}
{"text":"First time here and was extremely disappointed with the lack of service.  Went for lunch after seeing the add online. The restaurant was not busy at all and the waitress never came to take my order, I had to go to the cash register to ask to order.  Ordered the Apollo salad and the chicken shawarma dinner...both very disappointing. Had ordered water, never received it.  Waitress never bothered to check how we were doing.  Looks like the owner/manager was around but never bothered to help...and the restaurant was practically empty.  One of the cooks were wearing gloves and she was biting her finger while talking to another cook during idle time. It's a beautiful restaurant but I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken shawarma sandwich ( authentic ) . And it comes with fries . The sandwich was tasty and pretty much like any other shawarma place . Also ordered the spicy chicken manakeesh which had good amount of chicken in it and I would go again just for the manakeesh . My wife ordered the beef shawarma plate and it came with fries and rice and we felt the beef was a bit too dry and under cooked .  They also gave a complimentary dessert , some pastry stuffed with ice cream and we assumed it's a Mediterranean delicacy and looks like they have got the box from Costco . Over all I would say it's just another middle Eastern place . The staff there were very friendly which is something that I must mention ."}
