{"text":"Stopped here for a quick dinner with a friend as we were both craving some Korean fried chicken reminiscent of our time spent in Korea. I have to say, I really wasn't expecting much walking in (mostly just picked this place because it's a really convenient location - just steps from Finch stn), but I left very pleasantly surprised/satisfied!  The interior is pretty much your standard Korean restaurant/bar setting - dimmed lights, Korean music, K-pop videos showing on the TV screen. I was pretty happy that the music wasn't turned up overly loud as a lot of bars in the area tend to do so my friend and I could actually hold a conversation. It is not a big space at all but it didn't feel cramped even with another table sitting next to us.  The server was very helpful with navigating the menu and we ended up ordering the cheesed corn, standard half+half chicken (fried and sauced) and the spicy grilled chicken(?). They brought out some complimentary popcorn with our drinks and the corn came out pretty quickly - served on a sizzling plate and definitely a nice app to start with!   The chicken is of course the most important factor in judging a chicken restaurant and this place did not disappoint! Of all the Korean fried chicken places I've tried in Toronto, I think this place comes the closest to what I remember eating so regularly back in Korea. The fried half was very crispy, perfectly seasoned and made of smallish (but meaty) dark meat pieces. The sauce was the right mix of sweet/spicy and was not used excessively like some places do (on a side note, we did confirm with the server that the side radishes and the sauces for the chicken are both made in-house and not store bought).  We barely tried the spicy grilled chicken as we were both so full from the fried chicken but from what little I did try, it was a little too spicy for my tastes but a great complement to the fried chicken, in that it somewhat eases that \"greasy\" feeling you get after eating a few pieces?  All in all, will definitely be coming back here whenever I get a Korean friend chicken craving and would recommend to all looking for the same!"}
{"text":"Ever wanted to drink at a downtown bar at night in Seoul Korea? But never have the money nor the time to go there?!    its here. I was there last night from 12am to 2. I was in Korea. I drank soju and didn't eat anything there,nor did i pay...so i can't tell you about the food nor the prices.   great atmosphere if you want to travel to Seoul at night."}
{"text":"This restaurant specializes in Korean fried chicken. My fianc√© and I shared a basket of regular fried chicken and a basket of yangnyum chicken. I ordered a bowl of egg soup. The regular fried chicken was just average and a little bit dry. The yangnyum chicken was good, but not something that left us wanting to come back and eat it again. However, the egg soup was DELICIOUS! I really, really enjoyed it.   The interior of the restaurant is rather dim, as previous reviewers have mentioned. Service was good.  I would eat here again- but I won't order the chicken. I will order the egg soup!"}
{"text":"Went with the alcohol+food combo for $29.99 and ordered the large baked squash with cheese and bulgogi, and a crisp pitcher of Keith's beer. For some reason this dish had an additional cost of $2.00 on top. Not sure why.   Is the squash farming season going through a dry spell or something? I can't believe how PAPER THIN that squash was- I mean the mountain of bulgogi did alleviate some of our disappointment, but this was considered a squash dish on the menu.. The single squash slice was so non existent, it pretty much served as a thin little doily underneath which was basically just a cheesy bulgogi dish. The bulgogi itself was alright, lots of crunchy vegetables coiled between each piece of marinated beef.   Service was pretty standard for the area; attentive but not in your face. We came in on an early evening weekday, but it can get pretty packed on late night weekends in this small limited seating establishment."}
{"text":"Food is just so so. We came here just because someone recommend it on Weibo. Apparently you can't always trust words from Internet..."}
{"text":"yangnyum chicken yangnyum chicken yangnyum chicken!  Few people know about this place, but IMO this yangnyum chicken is better than the other place on yonge st (forgot the name sry). Drink up and enjoy real sized fried chicken at a good price!  There's stuffed bunnies on the wall.  Tip: don't get the regular fried chicken, it's just plain chicken, no taste. I think you're suppose to dip it in something but I don't know what it is. Tip2: as usual, more fun to take a korean friend here :) Tip3: don't go to this place to get drunk, just grab a beer or two. There are better places in k-town for drunk-getting. Tip4: there's no english on the menu, just pretend you're a tourist and enjoy the awkward  *looking at some other reviews here* y the flip would you come here if you don't want to eat meat? And does this place look like it's suppose to give you good service? what where you expecting for a $12 meal?"}
{"text":"love this place!  you gotta have their fried chicken!  best fried chicken in my life!  I prefer the regular one that comes with this yummy red sauce but the spicy one is good too.  the service can be a bit slow but the quality of the chicken is worth the wait.  besides, it gives u time to get drunk of soju. this is not a place to get a quick bite.  this is a place to chill over drinks and food with your friends. my friends and I hang out here for hours. good times and good memories!"}
{"text":"Fresh food but inconsistent service. The restaurant is a bit small however they make up for it in quality of rolls, freshness and their tasty bibimbap! At times, the staff has a tendency to forget orders. Brown rice instead of white rice etc."}
{"text":"i come here often bc its the closest place where i can get sweet n sour fried chicken (yangnyum chicken). there is only one waiter and the place is really small. the air circulation lacks so it really gets hot during summer. the food is good but yangnyum chicken takes a really long time to cook. but they give u on the house sweet pumpkin salad n lettuce salad while you wait. they have dimestic beer on tap (i had coors light), bottled beers and soju. they have other food items but fried chickens are their specialty"}
{"text":"I got the buddak chicken. It was   cheese and chicken breast grilled i guess. I was good but a little pricey for amount of food."}
{"text":"The good things about this place are that the food is good and they have all the drinks you need for a night of korean drinking (soju, beer, and mak gul li).  As it seems that mak gul li is only available in the more authentic korean places, I was really impressed that they even had two brands to choose from. Note: this stuff is super dangerous because you don't even realize there's alcohol in it until you try to stand up and head to the bathroom.  The not-so-good? As a korean drinking establishment, I assumed that Kokoya could easily fit my group of five people...but that was not the case. This place is pretty small and cramped, and not really great for big groups. It was also a bit hard to get the attention of the server sometimes, as the place was packed that night (Friday night).  The bill for a night of eating + drinking (not crazy stay-til-you're-kicked-out drinking, just tame, leave-at-midnight drinking) for five was $70 including tax and tip, which I think is pretty reasonable and comparable to other korean bars."}
{"text":"I went here on a thursday evening and was packed. The place is tiny so during peak hrs you have to wait. I place the order for take out and came back after twenty minutes. By the time our order was ready, people start to leave so we got a table. We had the half fried and half with sauce and corn cheese. It was fresh and delicious. It wasn't the best fried Korean chicken i had but one of the best and i would go back if im the area. The sauce wasn't what i used to eat in Korea but still tasty."}
{"text":"KFC was good but the cheese buldak made the experience.  Food: 4/5 Really good! Service: 4/5 Eager and efficient. Environment: 4/5 Casual fun pub. Washrooms: 4/5 Meh. Worth it?: 4/5 Will come back for the cheese buldak.  I was browsing the \"Nearby\" tab on Yelp while driving down Yonge Street (I was passenger) when I stumbled upon Kokoya. There was a picture of the \"cheese buldak\" and I knew I had to try it. We were initially planning to go eat a bit further up North but we quickly spun the car around.   Once seated and while going over the menu we had 2 different servers come by and ask if we were ready to order. I felt it was a bit eager but the rest of the service was pleasant and interruption free. Complimentary popcorn was also a nice touch.   We ordered the cheese buldak and a crispy fried chicken. The crisp fried chicken was good but not any better or worse than other KFC places. The cheese buldak was really good and was super cheesy. The chicken was juicy and tender. On the spicy side but I loved it!  I will definitely come back. It was a great meal and next time I will be sure to try the \"corn cheese\". Though the name doesn't sound pleasant, it seems to be a very popular dish here."}
{"text":"Sigh two sad little stars, urr umm yeah, two stars for sure. Now please understand that I am a vegetarian that eats fish, so I am not speaking to the flavor, quantity, or quality of the restaurants speciality; fried chicken. I am however speaking to the quality of the service and available food in this Korean slaughter house.   I think that in general when one has to leave a restaurant to find food somewhere else there is an issue. I had Pizza Nova down the block. This is not because I didn't try to find something I could/would eat, but in the only 15 items on the menu three were vegetarian, and two were fish. So carnivores eat your heart out, this is a mad chicken fiesta. Back to the sub par service and availability of food.   After arriving at the restaurant we found that it was a seat yourself situation, so we crowded near our friends hoping we could quickly order a beverage and get on with the eating. Sigh no chance of that for at least 25 minutes. After moving us closer to our party, I actually had to go up, retrieve a menu and let our server know that we wanted to order drinks for the table. Then we waited, and waited, this unfortunately became indicative of the service we would receive for the remainder of the evening.  Sadly when we finally were able to order drinks it turns out that that much anticipated soju was only to be had in its original form, unflavoured and a little like really cheap vodka. Our soju-ourne failed, it was high hopes for the food, big mistake. Of the five items that I could eat, only one was available at all, and it was bad. I settled on the onion rings and vast amounts of soju. One bite of a ring led me to thinking that,  \"maybe it's not rude to spit this back onto the plate\". Fortunately I followed my well taught table manners and dutifully swallowed.  It was at this time that I decided a trip outside of the restaurant may be in order. Beware fellow carnivores, I was not alone. Fellow Yelper \"I eat anything that lives\" Dale M also followed me out for a stellar slice.   Time to get pizza; 4 minute walk, 30 seconds at counter, 3 minute heat up , and time to eat. Time to get disgusting onion rings and soul-less soju; 20 minutes to wait for drinks, 16 minute wait for waitress to come back, 19 minutes for onion rings to appear, 1 second to get my ass out there for some new food.  Bottom line...Korean restaurants you may not want my white bread pesce-tarian ass in your lovely (insert sarcasm here) establishment, but my money is as good as any Asian wannabe. So guess what I don't want you either."}
{"text":"Cute little Korean bar run by Ma & Pa! Came by here, close by, sick of regular Korean restaurant. Was utterly surprised since the reviews I saw weren't that great. Wanted a quick bite and try their fried chicken all the rave these days.   My friend and I tried the bulgogi with squash and cheese, a good choice for those of you limiting carbs, and the Korean seafood pancake. I've never had the Korean dish w squash and cheese and I thought it was an interesting mix of food. The seafood pancake was also very delicious especially if you add the soya sauce it comes with. Also had a taste of their fried chicken, seemed a lil plain to me, must eat with sauce.!  The restaurant is pretty small and I felt our seats were a bit dingy and cramped. It's run by an old couple so don't expect super fast service. Overall I thought it was a cute location and I probably come back for their squash and cheese!"}
{"text":"A special night last night, honouring our Susan C.  Another Korean event created by Uncle Karl R.    The soju and beer flowed along the table like the Nile.  The fried food was gross.  The onion rings were mashed up onions that I think had been chewed up and spit out into a mould and then battered and deep fried.  Shameful.  The fried chicken was a bit better - but just a bit.  For Korean fried chicken, go a little down Yonge to Pojangmacha (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/pojangmacha-restaurant-north-york#hrid:MjbTu27lSzXOK0kfDSjzsw/src:self).  The food is much better.  If you are not a meat eater, eat before getting your soju on at Kokoya.  Poor Danielle P had to go down the street to eat a slice of pizza as the only non-meat item they had were the glorious onion rings.  Thankfully the night's food was saved by the Korean snacks - thanks Uncle Karl!!"}
{"text":"I tried both spicy and sweet fried chicken and soy sauce fried chicken. I definitely love soy sauce fried chicken much better. I just couldn't stop eating.   The rice cake with noodles looks really good as well. I think I will give that a try next time.  The store is offering daily special menu. I believe Tuesday is $20 for Large Chicken, and Wed is $26 for Large fried chicken with appetizer and pops."}
{"text":"Their fried chicken is good with variety of flavours. I would recommend here if you want to get a little taste of Korean style fried chicken."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. Slow service, average food. Had dried squid which was dry and hard to chew. I guess it goes with all the beer you'll be drinking.  Had the half and half. Wasn't spicy at all. The batter is fairly plain as well. Was hoping for more flavour, definitely disappointing. Chicken was hot and fresh. Maybe would do it for takeout."}
{"text":"This could have been a 4 star restaurant/korean-style bar but due to the outrageous pricing, I dropped a star in my assessment.  Before we begin - Important stuff: 1.  The menu here is not 100% English friendly.  One menu has English on it to identify the pictures of the dishes.  Anyone can use this to order.  However, the combo menu has zero English.  The combo menu offers combos where you choose your alcohol (either 5 bottles of beer or 1 bottle of soju) and one food item from a list.  To fully understand this combo menu, you need someone who can read Korean.  If you are willing to pay my way, I'll gladly volunteer to serve as your own translator and guide! ;-) 2. This is NOT your average Korean restaurant.  This establishment caters to a drinking crowd - specifically, a Korean drinking crowd.  Although its specialty is friend chicken, and this item can certainly be eaten as a meal, the lack of traditional Korean food items on the menu with its preference towards classic \"ahn-ju\" items sends a clear message that this establishment caters to Korean-style drinking and eating.  \"Ahn-ju\" are dishes served as accompaniment to alcohol.  The Japanese equivalent to this would be Izakaya.    What type of establishment is Kokoya?   It is a Korean-style drinking establishment  that specializes in fried chicken.  Meaning the dishes offered on the menu are a part of an \"ahn-ju\" menu.  \"Ahn-ju\" are dishes served as accompaniment to alcohol.  Although it can be eaten as a meal, generally, most menu food items are meant to be served with alcohol.   What do I mean by \"Korean-style\" drinking?   The Korean culture is a drinking culture.  This is similar to the Japanese culture - only Koreans are more extreme in the practice (yes, I've been to both Tokyo and Seoul).  The drink of choice for true Korean-style drinking is soju (rice wine) and it's lethal.  Sure it's only 20%, but it's an unrefined product so it hits you hard after 20 minutes.  Believe it or not, in the 70s, this stuff was even worse.  Now, it's more drinkable, but personally, I think it's disgusting.  If, however, you want to try true \"Korean-style\" drinking like the tortured souls on so many K-dramas, drink soju.  Soju is on the menu.  Location: Quite literally, it is a less than a minute walk from the Finch station surface exit at Yonge and Finch (NE corner).  It's just THAT close from public transit.  Very easy to find as it's right on Yonge.  What about the food?   We ordered: 1) Fried chicken 2) Yang-yum chicken 3) Dak Do Ri Tang (Spicy chicken stew) 4) Soju & Beers  Kokoya, being a Korean-style drinking establishment, serves \"Ahn-ju\".  Food that is meant for consumption with alcohol.  I should mention, although soju is sold, there is also beer (pints and bottles).  The house speciality here is the deep fried chicken Korean style.  This comes in two varieties: 1) plain old deep fried; and 2) Yang-yum (seasoned/flavoured to taste sweet + sour + hot - all at the same time).  My friend found the yang-yum chicken too spicy.  I thought it was perfect and delicious, but certainly not the best \"yang-yum\" chicken I've had.  The plain friend chicken was delicious too.  I actually preferred the plain fried chicken over the \"yang-yum\" option.  In the end, both plates were cleaned by my friends and I.  If you order these two house specialties, I suggest beer as the alcoholic choice.  It just goes down nicer with beer.  Soju would be more for spicy options like \"Jae Yuk Bokum\" (Pork & Kimchi fry) or \"Dak Do Ri Tang\" (Spicy Chicken stew in hot pot/bowl).  The dak do ri tang was also good.  A bit on the sweet side for my liking but not so sweet that I had to send it back or was unhappy with the order.  Overall the quality of the chicken and the food was acceptable.  No complaints.  In fact, the chicken was very good.  I was pleased with how moist and tender they were and how I didn't get that 'sick' feeling from ingesting too much oil.  Usually, I get that 'sick' feeling after two pieces of KFC, but the chicken here didn't do that to me.  The price - Is it worth it? Although I had no issues with the food, I had a serious issue with the price.  There are cheaper Korean-style drinking options out there."}
{"text":"A Korean bar that offers food+booze combos.You get a choice between a bottle of soju or beer. The food+booze combos run from $20-35.  Their appetizer consists of salad and mashed pumpkin.Service is usually slow here since they seem to have only one server working and it took 10 minutes to get the bill.  I don't recommend the spicy chicken wings at this place.It mainly tastes like hot pepper paste,which is quite disappointing, and it's not worth the price.Try Crazy Wings or other places north of Yonge and Finch."}
{"text":"Came in here randomly since we were too hungry to wait at the more popular places in the area. It was a rainy Thursday evening so we were the only people here along with another table. Our server was very nice and immediately brought water/tea and a bowl of complimentary popcorn after dropping off menus for us to mull over. Service in general was very attentive without being awkwardly overbearing. I noticed with customers who came in towards the end of our meal, the server recognized them and remembered their drink order from their last visit.  Ordered cheese corn and the split chicken (2 flavors). We got the crispy chicken and the soy sauce chicken. Food arrived very fast and piping hot. We also got complimentary pickled radish to help cool your tongue (we didn't order anything spicy though).  The crispy chicken was quite crispy and the meat was juicy. I liked the tangy sweet chili sauce it came with. Soy sauce chicken wasn't as crispy because it's premixed with the sauce. Fair warning there are bones! If you prefer boneless then this may not be the place for you.  Probably not my favorite Korean fried chicken in the city, but it's good enough that I'll come back if I'm super hungry in the area again.  We did have enough leftovers to take home but I think the portion size is still smaller than The Fry."}
{"text":"This little dive/bar has been my go to for Korean style fried chicken over the past 4-5 years.   Always consistent texture and seasoning on the chicken.    Unfortunately the food quality has taken a dive based on my last visit last week.  Hoping it was just an off day but unlikely because It seems that they have new owners.  Too bad, will have to find a new place."}
{"text":"I have been bingeing on KFC for few weeks (thanks Lambert!).  I was walking on Yonge street when I saw their menu on on the door. Fried chicken. Walked in without hesitation.  You make your order on a scantron sheet AYCE style. We ordered a small soy fried chicken. Fried chicken comes with a side of coleslaw and popcorn. Chicken was fresh and delicious.  I'm in love with the KoKo. Cute name, tasty fried chicken. Check it out if you are near Willowdale."}
{"text":"tried the half price wings on a tuesday and now i'm a wingitarian instead of a vegetarian  still by far one of the best wings ive been to i also believe they give you free popcorn as an appetizer which is always fun"}
{"text":"Tried the corn cheese and fried chicken. Love the corn but remember to finish it when it's still hot or the cheese will taste not as good. The chicken is crispy and juicy, but kind of oily so I can't really have more than 3 drumsticks.  Limited seating space but good for take out. The lady is really nice."}
{"text":"Very dimly lit place, which was a bit intimidating because it looked like a place where drug deals go down and korean mainlanders come out to play. Regardless, I wanted to try it.  I am not kidding when I tell you, kokoya has the absolute best korean fried chicken that I have ever tried in Toronto. The skin is fried to perfection and the taste is JUST right, the inside is hot and juicy and the entire thing is just deliciousness. I also like the fried mandu and the spicy rice cake platter. The food is very good. However, they've only got 1 person manning the back kitchen and it's really slow some days. Once I've had to wait 30 minutes for the food, and other times it comes out in 10 minutes or so. The fryer and all that jazz is in the back, and the owner in the front will use the front kitchen to cook and boil.   One major thing is, they might have a thing against cleaning tables as soon as a party leaves. I came in, and only one table was clean. We sat down there, and we were surrounded by dirty tables and plates. Not a nice sight. By the time we left, the dirty tables were STILL not clean. It seems as if they only clean a table when a new customer comes in, which is not a good habit to have. The owner and workers are usually very nice, but yesterday when I came in, they just stared at me and when I smiled and said 'for two', the owner did not have any reaction and did not smile back at the slightest. The worker then just told me to go sit at the only table that wasn't dirty- he simply pointed me in that direction. Customer service is a bit lacking, but they are sincerely sweet though. Perhaps just a bad mood.."}
{"text":"I had sweet & spicy fried chicken and cheesed corn. The fried chicken is fairly standard except it is not boneless (which isnt necessarily a bad thing.) The cheesed corn is very sweet and I wish it was grilled a bit longer to give some crispiness."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall and you'll probably miss it unless you're looking for it, but this place is great for Korean fried chicken. On par with the more popular chains.  I liked the free popcorn and good range of chicken choices and drinks. Most flavours are Korean-style savoury/sweet. The spring onion one is also pretty good if you don't like too much sauce. I usually get the half and half and a side, definitely enough for 2 people to share.   Service was acceptable, and ambience is pretty rustic/cozy.  Great place to catch up with friends!"}
{"text":"Yoga S I think got it about right.   Kokoya (Korean onomatopoeia for the sounds chickens make... we say \"cluck cluck\" Koreans say \"ko ko\" or \"ggo ggo\" according to the current hangual to white devil romanization system).  Kokoya serves up two kinds of fried chicken, a more traditional bread crumb batter and a crispy tempura type batter. Both are spicy (made with chili flakes) but the yang yum chicken heps up the spice a notch. It also heps up the sticky and saucy goop that ends up on  your fingers (I think the things are coated in corn syrup and crushed peanuts and sesame seeds). Some \"mool hyoo-ji\" would be nice to lavage your hands but luckily I don't go anywhere without my wet naps.   For those looking for a Korean \"fried chicken hof\" Kokoya doesn't quite capture the experience back in the mother land. I sure would have loved if they served up their pitchers chicken hof style: a double walled pitcher, water is poured between the walls, the things are put in a freezer, and then pulled out and filled with beer. Now that's a frosty mug sensation.   Kokoya is really small and by 9 pm on weekends the place is packed. On the plus side service was good. We came with a party of 16, mostly white devils, and the staff handled our large party very efficiently and friendly.   Over all the chicken I give a Cha-ka (http://static2.px.yelpcdn.com/photo/GdMtUPz_AkYaAXBHOuj_Ag/l) in terms of taste/value."}
{"text":"This place was good. I came here with friends and ordered the whole chicken. The chicken was tasty but the pieces were huge which made them hard to eat I would really prefer if the pieces were smaller. They got a TV screen there so if your out with a boarding chick you can always refer to watching the Korean TV full of k-pop music.  Over all the place is good but I pref home of hot taste to get fried Korean chicken.  All the best, K"}
{"text":"Very dissappointing fried chicken that is soggy and not flavourful at all. Every other fried chicken place is better than Kokoya."}
{"text":"When Janelle told me that we were going to go to Kokoya with some Toronto Yelpers, I assumed we were going to be slurping minnow eyeballs through a straw or eating deep fried chicken kneecaps like they serve at Ajisen http://www.yelp.com/user_details_review_search?userid=mr8V4_2wAC4H6JxQbDvxsA&q=ajisen. But when she told me that it was Korean fried chicken, I was excited.   Last summer, when Janelle and I got married in her hometown in Hawaii, we looked for every possible opportunity to escape the stress and explore the local food. There was a dirty little restaurant in the shabby neighborhood downtown that served Korean fried chicken. I had never had the stuff before, but it was fried chicken tenderloins tossed in a chili-sweet-soy sauce and served (like EVERYTHING in Hilo from hot dogs to spaghetti) over a bed of rice. It was so good that we ended up eating it three times that week, and I still crave that to this day.  This is not that. It's pretty hard to screw up spicy fried food, but this place did to fried chicken what Bobby Brown did to Whitney Houston.  If you want the Kokoya experience at home, let me show you how to recreate it. Drop by KFC and pick up a couple chicken drumsticks. Hit up McDonalds for some sweet and sour sauce and take a couple ketchup packets. Mix the sweet and sour sauce, the ketchup and toss in a couple red pepper flakes. Coat the chicken with this sauce and then tune your TV to the Korean channel, and turn it up full blast. Take your dirty gym clothes and a heavily-used ash tray with you into your closet and eat your chicken. Voila! Kokoya!  $20 per person got you two tiny pieces of chicken, an onion ring and a glass and a half of beer. I bet you could take that $20 up the street a little bit and get yourself a \"woman\" who would smell better than this place did. She'd definitely be more roomy.  In the end, everyone else's critique of this place is accurate. Or, to quote a wise Korean man from a popular American TV show:  \"I am also sharing these emotions, too\" - Bobby Lee, as Dr. Poon Ji-Sum http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMvk0KqS8aQ"}
{"text":"Get the yangyum chicken flavour! Jam packed with flavour and juicy chicken pieces!"}
{"text":"Kokoyaaaaaa. My gf and I came here the other day because we love trying Korean bars. Oh man this place is quite something! Some things right off the bat! Free wifi, cheap beer and good rice cakes!  We ordered the fried dumplings, spicy rice cakes and fried chicken of course. The fried dumplings tasted so nice and crunchy. The rice cakes was amazing. To me those rice cakes were more sweet then spicy and I love it. The chicken tasted like back in the day KFC chicken the nice fried style. It was so juicy and crunchy oh my god. Definitely coming back here!  I'd rate this place a 3.5 stars!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. Fried chicken with soy sauce is bae. Service is fast and nice. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Came here two times and had a nice experience. It was at times hard to flag down the staff but otherwise a great place if you're in the area.   The korean seafood pancake was absolutely delicious & even better w/ the soya sauce. It was so filling I had to take it home. We also got two sides (free) w/ the order (salad & white carrots?).  The wings were good but definitely needed the hot sauce for a little kick.    If you want to pay, you must go to the front.   Would probably visit again."}
{"text":"Got the basic whole fried chicken to go.  It was okay, but needed more seasoning.  portion was not very large for $25.  Would have been more okay paying that price if it was seasoned well."}
{"text":"Super impressed with the chicken being very tender and succulent. Tried the half and half chicken of sweet/spicy and soy sauce. Both were VERY good. Fingerlickin food.  Not many tables but didn't have any lines on a Friday night! So that's a big plus. Totally underrated. This is where I'm going for kfc. Legit."}
{"text":"One of my favourite place for Korean style fried chicken. My favourite would be the soy sauce one.  Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place time and time again thinking to myself that it does not look like a good place to eat.  Yet, I had this nagging voice in my head that urged me to try it just to be certain.  Well, I am now quite certain I will never come back.  If you want Korean fried chicken or any fried chicken you are better off finding the dirty bird of all dirty birds.  KFC.  I walked in and sat down while the two servers were at the counter eating their supper with cheeks packed full like chipmunks.  This is how she came to my table to serve me. WHAT THE FRAK?    The girl could barely speak english, never mind the fact that she did not know how many pieces of chicken are included in the small serving of fried chicken.  There were nine (9) in my serving.  She never told me a salad came with it (if iceberg lettuce and unknown gelatinous dressing counts as a salad).  Otherwise I would not have ordered the corn/cheese.    That is right...corn / cheese.  How is that a dish?  Waste of $5.00.  Initially she tried to sell me on a combo plate for $30.  I am one person and she tried to get me to order a combo fit for two - three people.    Never again.  Stay away unless you think overpriced KFC is a good idea.  Stay away......really it is not worth it.  BAD: No wet naps available. BAD: Horrible service BAD: Overpriced for no reason BAD: Corn / Cheese GOOD: I will never go back, and will never listen to that voice in my head urging me to try a place I know to be terrible.  END"}
{"text":"Wife and I have passed by this place numerous times, and figured we would finally try it. Being located in the heart of mini-Korea town (Yonge/Finch), I had high expectations for the dishes we were about to partake in.   FOOD: The \"Cheese squash with chicken\" met expectations, and came with ample cheese/onions to compliment the tender chicken. The \"Korean fried chicken\" was more bland then I had expected (no apparent seasoning/spices at all), but still had a nice crispy batter. A sweet and tangy red sauce accompanied the chicken however, and helped compensate for the lack of taste.    Kokoya offers a few different combo options ($29.99) where you can combine certain food items with alcohol (mostly soju or beer).   SERVICE: The waitress was not as attentive as she could have been (disappeared for stretches of the meal and needed to be flagged down), but was quite friendly. The food actually arrived much quicker than I was expecting, which of course was a pleasant surprise.  SUMMARY: If you're looking to have a few drinks and some grub in a typical Korean bar atmosphere (complete with K-Pop on the TV), give this place a try."}
{"text":"Chicken and soju. The perfect combination. The chicken was crispy and juicy. Not drenched in sauce but definitely didn't skimp out either. Just the way I like it. It wasn't spicy but still tasty. Also ordered the corn and cheese. Can't go wrong with that. Radishes and beets as our sides. Also got the dumplings. They were nicely seasoned and pan fried. Everyone keeps talking about the squash but they took it off the menu so sadly I never got the chance to try it. Such a satisfying night. Good food and company. Didn't have any problems with the service. Our server worked out the bill so that the price was cheaper for us as a combo than individual orders. She was fluent in English so we didn't have any communication problems as previous reviewers mentioned. Very chill place but does get packed quickly!"}
{"text":"I went here at around 10:30pm, we were seated right away. I got their spicy cheese buldak and my friend got the half & half chicken. The buldak came first, very hot and sizzling. The sauce used reminded me of the sauce for dukbokki. We both liked eating it and they were not lenient with the cheese which is a good thing! The chicken came and I thought it was okay (I am not a big fan of fried chicken). The servers were attentive and fast.  This place is a good location for eating fried chicken and drinking"}
{"text":"This is our go to place for fried chicken. We usually get the Soon Saar chicken, which is boneless, sweet and spicy. Not only is it crispy on the outside but also soft and juicy on the inside. It is full of favour and will leave you craving for more. The staff is really friendly which is a bonus. Price is reasonable and you get what you pay for. I have also tired other Korean fried chicken places in the nearby area but Kokoyaa tops all. I will happily keep going back!"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Korean restaurant I've tried in Toronto. It's too pricy but the food ingredients were of the lowest quality. The cheese corn was just out of a can. The fried chicken were not seasoned properly. We ordered 4 dishes and the bill came out to be almost 80 bucks. I can't fathom how the other reviews were good. Sorry, but not recommended at all."}
{"text":"Went here twice. The first time I ordered Buldak, the waiter asked if I knew it was spicy and I said yes & that I've had it before. The Buldak wasn't spicy at all, mild at best. The second time, I got fried chicken, which was ok. Considering the restaurant is supposed to spealize in it, it wasn't that great or worth it for the price."}
{"text":"Would give ZERO star if possible. Worst Korean food EVER! Super expensive and shitty. Almost puked afterwards."}
