{"text":"This is our favorite Portuguese restaurant.  Food is delicious, though service can sometimes be slow!  Make a reservation on a weekend night.  

My favorite dish is the Porco Alentejana (pork with clams and little fried potatoes in a sizzling sauce)."}
{"text":"Service excellent, tapas excellentes, les crevettes piquante sont succulente, la pieuvre aussi. Et que dire de la brandade de morue, la meilleure que j'ai gouté.
2 bemols toutefois: le lieu est très bruyant et les prix plutôt élevé. Mais j'y retournerais pour goutter le reste de la carte"}
{"text":"C'est la saison du homard?mes amis m'dit! Je ne sais pas comment le cuisine,alors je trouve Casa Minhota,c'est délicieux!les serveurs sont sympathiques!et à la prochaine fois!"}
{"text":"Attente extrêmement longue, service quasi absent et un peu brusque.. Les prix des plats ont augmenté d'au moins 3... Dommage car les produits sont frais et c'est globalement bon."}
{"text":"Super cozy atmosphere, friendly staff, and decent meal. I'd probably go back for a hearty meal on a cold winter night.

The details: We went for dinner on a cool, rainy night. Staff was very friendly, and service was excellent. Main dining room is cozy--but not stuff--and intimate but not in a romantic way (it's not just couples). Amazing bread basket showed up almost immediately after we sat down. If only we hadn't eaten so much of it before our meal came! The grilled octopus appetizer was probably the best dish of the night: nicely cooked, delicious sauce/relish. Our mains were the meat grillade mixte and seafood grillade mixte--we wanted to sample everything. Meat came with mandolin potato fries, and seafood came with rice. If you like veggies, order a side salad or a different dish altogether. Meat was tasty but not ideal: pork was overcooked and dry; lamb was super fatty and overcooked. Steak and chorizo were yummy and properly cooked. Seafood was nicely prepared in a delicious (albeit overly salty) tomato sauce. We drank a good house red that was appropriately priced. We didn't order dessert--too full!"}
{"text":"What can i say, this is my go to place when i feel like having solid good food, good service and... Excellent bread with olives and olive oil.
As a Moroccan, i love doing my bread in the olive oil. Their bread as well as their oil are excellent.
One of preferred meals is the grilled chicken. Every time it's juicy, crispy and tasty. Ask at the same time.
Guys take care of my nice plate.
Come and try this place which has been part of the community for so long"}
{"text":"Fabulous Portuguese food. Go to Portuguese place when I am in Montreal with friends, dining room is very nice or even by yourself at the bar.   Service is consistently a1.  The shrimp in Sauce  cooked in a clay pot with bread, churico, steak on a stone, the cod, the bacalhao, the octopus and grandmas dessert are all excellent. Wine list is healthy, Quinta do Portal my fave and can't miss the Porto and expresso to finish. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!!! Food is amazing! Service is better! Highly recommended. Garlic shrimp is soooo good."}
{"text":"Si vous n'aimez pas la morue( la vraie,pas celle de fereira) allez ailleurs.meme si le reste est très bon aussi.personnel aimable et empresse,beaux vins,cadre vieillissant,clientèle fidèle.charmant..."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the simple facade of this place on St. Laurent. The interior nicely tiled and cozy and the food was delicious.
We had a rack of lamb and grilled seabass steak. The lamb was a bit in th overcook side for me, nevertheless it was delicious with the thinly sliced potatoes and the minimum greens it came with. My dinner companion didn't finish her seabass steak, but I think it was because the sheer size of it. We washed the dinner down with a half liter of house rioja. It was a pleasant dinner."}
{"text":"Good food, nice service and good wine. We will come back again even just for the people here. Recommend the seafood here especially the lobster and cod."}
{"text":"Sunday evening, steady stream of diners-service was excellent. The atmosphere and decor are very inviting. Expansive menu of Portuguese fare-mostly meat and seafood. Not much to choose from if you are a vegetarian. My husband had the sirloin steak-served with broccoli and fried potatoes. My daughter had grilled chicken with a salad and fried potatoes. Both enjoyed their selections-cooked perfectly. I had the Caldo Verde (green cabbage) soup and asked for it without the chorizo sausage. It was good. For my meal I had the house salad-perfect portion of greens, artichoke, cheese, onion, egg, cucumbers and tomatoes served with a delightful creamy vinaigrette dressing. No room for dessert, though!"}
{"text":"Here right now. Just finished a great table d'hote - garlic snails, sardines, added a watercress salad, fisherman's platter."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of eating here a few days after my horrible wait staff experience at Restaurant Portuscalle just a few doors down.  The service and food quality was a thousand times better at Casa Minhota!

The dining room has lovely hand painted tile all around.  There were about 6 tables of small groups and one huge table of about a dozen patrons all served diligently by ONE WAITER!  Everyone got their food at a very reasonable time.  Everyone had full water glasses, bread and olive oil, dessert menus.  This guy was amazing.  He was even humming and whistling the entire time.

We started with the chorizo which was delicious and prepared very well.

I ordered the house specialty grilled chicken which was very tasty and juicy.  The accompanying salad was lightly dressed and fresh.  The potatoes were crispy and flavorful.

My fiance ordered the filet which was served on a very, very, I mean magma hot, piece of slate or some other type of rock.  The steak was sizzling as it was set on the table, and continued to sizzle for quite some time.  The steak was done medium rare but continued to cook on the table.  The stone remained hot through our entire dinner.  I even heated up some of my leftover potatoes on it.  It was great.  You could literally cook the steak more to your liking if you don't like your steak a little red.  

The wine choices complimented the meal perfectly.  It was such a pleasantly different dining experience from the other place down the block.  When back in Montreal, I would definitely eat at Casa Minhota again."}
{"text":"Service extrêmement lent. Nourriture bonne mais vérifier attentivement votre facture. On avait pris la table d'hôte mais on nous a chargé à la carte en nous disant que la morue grillée n'était pas le même prix que la morue fraîche ou bouillie. On n'y retournera pas..."}
{"text":"This is my first time ever dining at a Portuguese restaurant and went with 6 people. Waiter was the only server but spoke very good English, had a great personality,  was attentive to all tables, and explained dishes well. Chicken, steak, cod, salad and paella were all fantastic topped off with the red house wine. Would definitely go back if in the area again."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend for her birthday and we both loved it. It's affordable, the food is really tasty, and the service is great. We started with a salad--the dressing was so yummy!! We ordered the house wine and Portuguese Paella for our main course. Loved the paella! The seafood was FRESH and the dish was well seasoned. The house wine was impressive--house wines aren't usually this tasty, at least in my experience, but this one was really good!! Overall, it was a pleasant experience, and I would definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"We just walked into the establishment and was seated quickly.  I ordered a seafood platter which was amazing with the amount of fish and seafood you receive on a plate. The flavor was great and was cooked perfectly. Recommend this restaurant for those who want to enjoy some good seafood."}
{"text":"Well, that was kinda unexpected. We've been to this restaurant long time (about 15 years) ago and have very nice memories. So, being in Montreal once again we had no hesitation of coming, especially considering all great reviews on TripAdvisor (was this only our experience???)

Anyways, my wife ordered \"Cod Minhota Style\", my daughter - seafood platter and I had \"Cod Lagareiro Style\" (grilled with garlic). We also had an appetizer, calamari.
Calamari were actually quite good no questions there.  My fish was absolutely loaded with bones. I've never had in any restaurant fish with bones, it was appalling. In addition to this, it was a bit over-grilled.... read \"burned\" and \"swimming\" in oil, way too much of it.

My wife's fish was very dry, almost \"shoe sole\" consistency under the layer of potatoes and sautéed onions... Only later (when we left) I learned how not tasty it was.

Last, but not least, the seafood platter... I tried one clam from it and spitted it out.... I tried one mussel... it was cold... did it come from the jar??? My daughter said that shrimps, scallops and lobster were not that bad, but where did those cold mussels come from??

Once food was served our waiter didn't bother to check on us, though we did mention that we have great memories and so on...

Was there stranger in the kitchen?? That was really awful meal and waste of $140.... Never again."}
{"text":"I might be a bit biased since I LOVE Portuguese food, but my gf who never tried it left with my same obsession after eating here.

Casa Minhota is a case example of delicious food meeting EXCEPTIONAL service. Upon walking in, my gf and I were cordially greeted by who I can only describe as the new gold standard in maîtres d's: Joe. Boasting his ability as a polyglot, Joe was able to hold conversations in at least three different languages during my stay. After struggling through the menu looking for the best bang to my buck, Joe noticed and assured me and my gf that he'd take care of us...I'll take it. Sipping on the well-selected wine that Joe so graciously recommended, out came two sizzling cocottes full to the brim with seafood: in one, calamari rings, in the other, mussels. Clean plates. Compliments to the chef, some friendly chit chat, and a few healthy minutes pass. A hot ceramic pot of steam and aroma fills the vacant real estate on my table. Inside, a myriad of seafood and shellfish rest over a bed of saffron rice. The fresh, full flavor that the chefs in the back of Casa Minhota can conjure up with some seafood, parsley, lemon, and garlic (probably leaving out a few more key ingredients) in icy Montreal no less, is magic. 

There was more to my experience, including more wine and desserts, and of course they were also delicious. But words don't do the experience justice and suffice to say that Joe really did take care of us. This restaurant and the staff inside made my last night in Montreal very special and it's a must-go in my opinion."}
{"text":"One of the best places I have eaten at! I highly recommend this heavenly delightful restaurant. Food is amazing, you'll sit in silence savouring each bite of food. Start with their signature shrimp. You can thank me later."}
{"text":"This is a really cozy place. The food and the service was delightful. The pear dessert, steak, and even the escargot. The Portuguese fries are very simple, yet delicious. Their plates are plated well, accented appropriately, and portioned nicely. While they serve their table bread cold, it is still light. Given the large number of staff members working, service was quite slow, though the place was a bit busy."}
{"text":"Amazing as always and the cast of characters are fabulous. The food is great. No complaints ever."}
