{"text":"Food is ok at best but given the prices a one star rating is deserved.  Stingy with servings, condiments and even napkins.  Service is very NY which is not a good thing.  Better options in the area for a lower cost."}
{"text":"Service is slow and the food was bad. My burger was crunchy from sitting on the grill too long. They microwaved my daughters hotdog. Paid $18 for a small burger, chicken sandwich, plain hotdog, fries and a drink."}
{"text":"We waited for ever for a heated frozen burger patty. Order wasn't taken in a timely manner. Perhaps a language barrier. We wanted to ask for a refund but don't think the cashier who is also the cook would understand what we were wanting since he couldn't give us a plain burger."}
