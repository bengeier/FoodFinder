{"text":"Great sandwiches comes with fresh salad or yummy soups! I had the grill chicken sandwich with avocados and there other lovely sandwiches. Great place! Only down size they dont take credit cards!  Prices for grilled chicken sandwich with soup or salad for $8.5 taxes included!"}
{"text":"This is a typical diner styled Cafe. It's a little chaotic at lunch time when I went but that's standard of any lunchtime place. It felt a bit rushed but it was quite busy. It's serve yourself style w the coffee which is a standard brew and similar to tims dark roast for decent pricing. It's tucked underarm office building so I can definitely see it being a Regular hang for people there for there many breakfast and lunch specials"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in ages, but just had to add in the pricing category of this dinner is not $$$$!!!  edit:  Hmm me adding this review completely changed the price category.  Phew!"}
{"text":"It's at the bottom of a medical building. Super weird location and my wife and I almost didn't go in. Thankfully we did. It's small and clean. Very clean. Food was surprisingly good. Kind of small portions but I guess it minimizes waste. :) the tomato soup was pretty good. The salad you get with sandwiches is surprisingly delicious. Like super delicious. I would recommend this place. But I would recommend slightly better signage outside."}
{"text":"Food is freshly cooked, service is excellent and prices very reasonable. You won't get this quality at any price elsewhere. It really is surreal in today's time."}
