{"text":"I came here for a sit down meal late at night. The chicken strips were the best I have ever had, and the fries were good... but hey, it's just chicken strips and fries. If you're not into bars (like me) and need a late night meal it's a good place to stop.   Located in the Palms."}
{"text":"we just went yesterday to try the $8.99 prime rib and it was pretty satisfactory. you need to show your club member's card to get this deal. and this prime rib came with baked potato, mixed veggie, horseradish and au jus. I honestly have to say that you can't expect the prime rib to be as good as other steakhouse, but it is good enough for a decent meal. by the way, this deal is currently offered between 11am to 11pm daily.  they offered other special deals after 11pm like NY steak & eggs, etc. We also got a nice courteous server and everyone seemed nice there overall. While we got a prime rib for each of us (me and hubby), we also got a cup of French onion soup. I gotta say they made it too salty and they cooked it with too much black pepper which overpowered the onion. So we didn't feel that it was an onion soup at all, it was more like salty beef broth instead."}
{"text":"Finally finished prime rib SP. Now $13.99, but too large than before."}
{"text":"Decent food, service was on the border of being below average.  I would recommend finding something else unless you're too drunk to walk any further."}
{"text":"Fucking worst restaurant I ever ate. Grand lux is the best tasting 24/7 cafe in Vegas and is only marginally more expensive than this shit hole. Service was decent but I hate places that jack up prices and are no better than a coco's restaurant."}
{"text":"Picked up our Bill Maher tickets and decided to stop for a quick bite at the 24/7 cafe. What a surprise... nicely decorated,  friendly and efficient wait staff and specials galore! I had the unlimited spaghetti and meatballs with a salad and bread stick for $6.99. An ample serving the first time, no room for 2nds. I asked for some parmesan and got it freshly shaved. The lemon-aid was refreshing and was constantly refilled. My husband had the prime rib special that comes with vegetable and either mashed or loaded baked potato, but asked for fries and got them!.  He ordered the beef rare and that's how it came. We walked out satisfied and didn't spend very much. Great cheap eats for good quality food."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars, I would.  Horrendous and rude customer service.  Ordered a coffee and a wrap.  After about 10 minutes had to remind server about the coffee.  Took almost another 10 minutes to bring the coffee out.       Waited another few minutes, by now it had been almost a half hour and the wrap was nowhere to be seen.  Heard many other customers complaining and the staff as well as management apparently didn't give a s##t.  Was sitting near the cashier and when a hotel guest called for room service, she had the audacity to ask \"how soon are you expecting your food, because we're kind of backed up here\".  I had heard enough.  Got up and asked her how much I owed for the coffee, as it had been over half an hour and I was still waiting.  Without any apology and just a snotty attitude she handed me the check.  I paid and left.  This place should really learn from some other Vegas establishments that cater to their customers.  Employees don't care and seems neither does management.  But it's symptomatic of the Palms Hotel and how apparently they're going downhill in all aspects!"}
{"text":"The prime rib looked so good from the Yelpers photos.  I told myself that I got to try it, but what a disappointment. I ordered my prime rib medium rare. When my dish came, it looked medium rare which with pink color in the center and I was so excited, but it was very tough.   My husband's chicken fajita was a little bit dry but tasty.   Love the dark chocolate cake. It was very rich and moist. We couldn't stop digging in. I got to take one home.   Overall, the food was OK, but the service was very good."}
{"text":"we were at the palms and were looking for food in the morning and decided to stop by here because they were advertising their $6.99 steak and eggs breakfast.  the staff was very welcoming and nice from the minute we walked in to the minute we left which was very nice.  at first there was nobody as far as other customers in the restaurant so we weren't sure how good it was going to be.  we all got the steak and eggs and were very pleased.  when my mothers steak first came out, it was pretty over cooked (she asked for it medium rare and it was well done), she told the waitress who brought her out a new steak in a few minutes that was cooked perfectly.  the eggs were just your normal eggs, and the hashbrowns were the usual, but man, that steak was really good.  no need for steak sauce or anything as it was seasoned perfectly and cooked just right.  so tender and juicy, with loads of flavor.  if i am at the palms again, ill stop by and get it again"}
{"text":"Ordered room service first morning stay no problem. Food was great and service was good. 2nd morning a whole different story. 4:15am ordered food. They said it would take 30 minutes. Ok, no problem. 4:45 nothing, 5:00 nothing. I called back at 5:15am an hour later and they said they knocked on my door and called. No one knocked on my door or called. I was awake the whole time getting ready. Not drunk, not hung over, and not loud in my room. So they said they would reheat the food and it would take 5 minutes. I said ok that's fine. 5:45 nothing. I had to be somewhere at 6:15 so as I walked down to my car I pass the cafe and 3 ladies were at the counter and when I told them about it it seemed like I was talking in a different language. All they kept saying was the manager will be here in 5 minutes. I said I cannot wait just cancel it it's been over an hour I have to go. So I get back to my hotel room and check my bill on the TV and of course they charged me. So I talked to one of the ladies on the phone, no refund, lol. Ok Manager next same story. I said how can I be charged something I never got. They both kept saying they called, they knocked, and they delivered twice. I said no, no, and no. So finally got my refund after about 10 minutes on the phone. After that I see my phone blinking and see I have a message. Guess what they did call! At 6:08am. Almost 2 hours after I originally had called. Lol. Wow! I gave 2 stars because the food is actually good. Service, terrible."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service. The server was awful!! She came to take the order and we never saw her again a buster brought our food out. I had to get my own to go box for my food and had to ask the cashier for my check because I had no idea where our server was. Do not go to this cafe!!"}
{"text":"The Palms recently changed hands; given our horrible experience at the 24 Seven Cafe, the changes aren't for the better.  This coffee shop, located adjacent to the Palms' convenient self parking garage, used to be inexpensive and reasonably decent.  Now the food is inedible and the prices eye-popping.  There are American and Asian menus.  The American menu features $10 burgers, $12 BLT sandwiches, and late at night a $7 ham steak and eggs (toast is extra).  Soft drinks are $4 and a cup of hot water with a tea bag will set you back $5 -- unless you order from the Asian menu where hot tea is $1 per person.  We wound up ordering from the less-expensive Asian menu.  One of us had $9 kung pao chicken which was OK, but rice is now $1, and the free crispy noodles with duck sauce and mustard that used to arrive automatically is no more.  I ordered the $9 beef chow fun with gravy.  It almost arrived with the kung pao, but the waitress said, oops, we forgot the gravy so I sat there for 15 minutes or so watching my SO eat her kung pao while they redid the chow fun.  The beef chow fun with gravy turned out to be no fun, the \"gravy\" was some tasteless brown substance that was so greasy the chow fun noodles slid off the fork every time I tried to eat them.  The beef was likewise bland and inedible.  A bottle of soy sauce was served with brown crud caked onto the side of the bottle.  \"It's only dried soy sauce,\" she explained.  There is just no comparison to, say, the excellent and reasonably priced Chinese and American fare a few miles down the Strip at the South Point.  You can also drive a mile or so north to Las Vegas' Chinatown.  What is the Palms' management thinking?  $4 iced tea?  Extra for white rice with a Chinese entree, or toast with your eggs??"}
{"text":"--- make sure you arrive with your Palms Club membership card for the oh so exclusive discounts!  - great because it's open 24 hours... and not every casino has a place with a variety of late night options.... the specials are worth taking advantage of... especially if you might have spent a little too much at the slots... or just need a break from expensive LV fare...   I ordered simple breakfast items that were of diner quality.. and hard to mess up... eggs, bacon, hashbrowns, toast... coffee....  bill was around $15.00 including tip...  clean and simple atmosphere... excellent and attentive waitstaff..."}
{"text":"Saw a billboard for 8.99 prime rib. You have to get a players card to get that price, so we sent one of our group out to sign up. Otherwise, it's 17.99.  Is was decent for the price, but definitely overcooked.  Broccoli was tasteless. Potato had hard spots inside.?.  Horseradish was really good and spicy though!"}
{"text":"Late night dim sum totally hit the spot. The options are a little limited, but the food was good. We had the shu mai, crystal shrimp dumplings, and stuffed crab claw. The shu mai and dumplings were good, but I wouldn't suggest the crab claw. The stuffing was dry and the crab was overcooked. All in all, it was a great post-club snack and pretty inexpensive."}
{"text":"came in on Sunday night @ 530pm, place was slow 7 tables of customer's. service was SLOW. we got the Chinese food : wonton soup, orange chicken. cashew chicken, Hong Kong noddle , all was VERY VERY GOOD. We asked for crispy noodle server said we don't have them any more the palms got rid of them WTF!! Y crazy crispy noodle and soup  go together!! I'm so glad they got rid the Mexican restaurant that was awe full food. I think maybe they should have keep the oyster bar, and made it awesome, but o well who am I to say.  need less to say the food was good server was good , but a very boring place."}
{"text":"prices are decent considering it's casino food. the chicken matzo ball soup's flavor was good but too salty. the french dip ($11.99) was flavorful and the bread nicely toasted. the lobster crab cobb salad ($16) was refreshing"}
{"text":"this is a great breakfast lunch dinner or middle of the night place they always have specials and food is fresh and hot  I an the type of girl who likes my prime rib rare not medium not well completely rare and they were really good about making sure it was up to my standards right now they have a 8.99 prime rib special that comes with steamed vegetables and your choice of mashed potatoes baked potatoes or loaded baked potato. it also comes with a side of ajue  and a side of horseradish it is a big plate full and I can never finish all of that  my all time favorite at this place is there four cheese macaroni and cheese not like a box macaroni and cheese that someone would serve for a kids menu it is phenomenal orgasm in your mouth every bite you take the noodles are cooked to perfection not only does it have a really thick cheese sauce it tastes like liquid gold it also has the option to add beef bacon or lobster into the macaroni and cheese and when it's all done they place a cheesy crust on top and bake it it is garnished with  two pieces of garlic bread  the service is very quick they're quick to refill your drinks and they even have a exclusive Chinese food menu menu is to die for almost everything on it is amazing you will not regret going here no matter what time of the day it is"}
{"text":"Great place to get a late night meal in Vegas. Great service, great price points, and great hotel!   Before you eat here, you need to understand that this is a cafe that is open... 24/7... Duh. Don't expect Morton's or Flemming's quality food at a place like this... If you do, well 1. You're ignorant, and 2. You'll be disappointed. For late night/ cafe food, it's really quite good. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The Kobe beef meatloaf is the greatest thing I have ever eaten at a casino coffee shop, and I make my living playing poker, so I eat in A LOT of casino coffee shops. I have had the Kobe beef meatloaf five times now, and it is consistently excellent. LEGENDARY!!!"}
{"text":"I've dined pretty much every coffee shops in the casinos but nothing worse than this coffee shops. Despite the food quality, I want to talked about their  worst customer services that I've received in my life !  I simply asked for a sliced of lemon and a pack of honey because the water taste was funny; but the waitress immediately respond to me that \" It will be charge $ 3.00 since those lemon & honey cost money ?!\" .  I was astonished by her replies and request if they have any rules or fine prints on the menus that the condiments eg. sugars, ketchups etc. cost extra charges;  but she said NO, they don't have it !  then I requested to spoke with the management so when the Assistant Manager Rosa Zelaya came to talk to me, she even said the same things ?!  I will never dine in this restaurants again. Beware look at your receipt, they will charge extra charges for condiments ! and they will charge any prices they want because its not on the menus !"}
{"text":"Essentially, this place is an old-style casino cafe trying, but kind of failing, to be modern and stylish.    But, whatevs, they have $7.99 prime rib! What what!  It's an enormous slice of prime rib (with an actual pepper crust!), cups of steamed broccoli and big-ass baked potato or mashed potatoes.  And, you know what? It was pretty good! I was shocked.  They even cooked it as asked -- rare!  I am easily swayed by promises of low-priced red meats.  Ellis Island, Mr. Lucky, they've all suckered me in.  I'd have to say the meat quality was better here than the other spots.  However, Ellis Island still is #1 on the deal-o-meter.    They also have other random things like a full Chinese menu, pho, and meatloaf.  The waitresses are also endearingly cranky.  Luckily, that's the way I like my casino waitresses.  Solid spot.  P.S. - You'll need a Palms player card to order the prime rib special."}
{"text":"Palms 24/7 got rid of all their specials so don't go for value anymore.  There was extreme noise from renovations.   Food was reasonable but walking out was an option we considered. Struggles to get to average."}
{"text":"They offer daily specials as well as $8.99 prime rib 24/7 which has always been delicious. Open atmosphere."}
{"text":"Mostly good food, bad service, fair prices.  We went here because we weren't a fan of the Palms buffet and already had our expensive (but fantastic) meal at Nove. I ordered a grilled patty melt which was a burger with onions and cheddar on rye bread  with russian dressing with a side of cole slaw.  Burger was good. On par with the diner patty melt I get back in Long Island which is great. Cole slaw was pretty disgusting though.  It tasted like garbage (I hope they didn't actually get it from the garbage).    Service was very slow. We waited 20 minutes for our food. Also, I got GRILLED by the waitress because she thought I wasn't going to leave a tip. You have to pay at the register after your meal so that's what I did and was going to leave a tip after I got changed. She stared me down until she realized I was going back to the table to leave her a tip."}
{"text":"Another disaster @Palms this time at Fortunes 24 Seven Cafe. Food was okay. Service was TERRIBLE. Took 8 min to get seated +14 min to order. Server never checked back to table until meal was completed. Not good."}
{"text":"We went here on a Wednesday night for dinner specifically to sample their $7.99 prime rib special.  There was no wait and got seated immediately, got orders placed and drinks served.  I felt that the service was extra prompt, though the restaurant was only half full.  The prime rib arrived after a few minutes, and were cooked exactly to our specifications.  The plate comes with mixed veggies and your choice of potato.  I have to say that this prime rib special is probably the best \"value-class\" prime rib I've had in recent memory.  It's got a real flavorful crust and combined with the equally good au jus and creamy horseradish, is more enjoyable than any buffet prime rib I've had in Vegas.  It's probably as good, if not better in flavor to higher end buffet prime rib like Bacchanal's or Wicked Spoon's.  Unlike buffet prime rib this one is sliced a meal size of 10 ounce, instead of the typical thin slices in buffets.  I've had much better prime rib ofcourse and this won't hold a candle against Lawry's or even just a local steakhouse quality prime rib such as the Cortez Room's.  However, for just $7.99, this is a winner.  If there were a standardized measurement of taste per dollar, this prime rib would on top.  Oh, before I forget, you'll need a Palm's club card to avail the special.  Happy eating!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars.  It's OK but not A-OK.  I ate here once late after an evening at the clubs in the Palms.  The food was just OK.  My main gripe is the breakfast scramble whatever I ordered tasted really, really salty.  It was edible, but would have benefited greatly from a lot less salt.  Bear in mind, I'm not hyper sensitive to salt in my food.  I'm not ruling this place out for future visits, but I will rule this place out in a heartbeat if I'm served another plate of too salty food."}
{"text":"Considering that this cafe is 24 hrs I'm expecting that they provide quality food and service 24 hours which was NOT the case. My boyfriend and I decided to stop by after a club to grab a small bite. First of all, it took forever for someone to take our order and even longer to bring our food. Considering that we ordered soup and fries it didn't seem like the wait time was warranted. I ordered the tomato soup and it was so salty and thick. It tasted like hot spaghetti sauce with a lot of salt. I tried my boyfriend's chicken noodle soup and it was not much better. Noodles were gummy and bland. Our fries were cold and soggy. We decided to get a cupcake hoping to end our visit on a good note, but unfortunately the cupcake was not much better. It was cold and hard as if it were refrigerated. Frosting and cake were hard. We did not finish any of our food. I did comment on my soup and the manager took it off our bill but that wasn't the point however I appreciated it. I just hope the cafe gets it together and starts selling quality food. We were staying at the Palms on vacation and part of a great experience is having great food and that was not the case."}
{"text":"The food is decent and the prices aren't bad, but the horrible service outweighs everything.  When we came in it wasn't busy at all, and yet there were hardly any waiters on the floor. Everyone in there was sitting for long periods of time just because they were waiting for their check. I even turned my dessert away because it took them almost 30 MINUTES to get out a measly slice of cheesecake.  My omelette was tasty, but I don't think I'll ever come here again."}
{"text":"After a somewhat disappointing visit at Chocolat Bistro, we walked across the lobby to 24 Seven Cafe to see what kind of snackables they had  We were just looking for a nibble to tide us over until our early dinner rezzies & luckily they had a case full of sweet treats  I chose the Eclair - it was a decent, standard eclair - the filling was more of the whipped cream variety but many eclairs have this & while I prefer the custard filling, this whipped version was A-OK  Mr chose the Fruit Tart & a latte - the fruit was sweet & ripe & the custard base wasn't too sweet - it was a nice little snack break  The latte was very milky - needed more coffee in the ratio but it wasn't bitter & the Mr said he'd had worse so he'd rank it as a standard / middle of the road  Weird part was that we were advised it was not possible to charge our food to the room & our $10 bill carried heavy ID scrutinizing by the cashier  Really?  You're sooo concerned about my ID for a $10 snack?  Guess I should offer props that you take your job so seriously"}
{"text":"This place is great!! They have a new menu that is almost the same a red rocks and the server let me know that everything was made in house this cafe has a lot of different options like gluten Free items and healthier choices. The food was great and the service was great. Everyone treated me like more that a guest more like a regular that they see all the time. I am definitely going back her because it was on of the best experiences while dinning in Vegas"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with the family and a couple of friends. We ordered Chinese food and it took a long time for the entrees to be served. The people that sat after us got their food first. When the food was finally served, they were incomplete. We had to wait again for the rest of the food to be delivered to our table. Even though the food server wrote our order down, she forgot a couple of dishes. No one apologized to us for waiting so long."}
{"text":"As locals it takes a lot for us to eat at casinos. We enjoyed breakfast at 24 Seven in the past because the prices were good, there was great variety (breakfast all day!!), and the portions matched the pricing. We went today and found everything had changed and now food is overpriced, tiny, and the selection is minimal. We stayed because I had a voucher for my birthday, but we will not be returning by choice. The chicken and waffles sounds exciting but costs about $15.  The second star is only because the staff are consistently kind and quick with the coffee refills."}
{"text":"The service was sub-par. Ordered one of the skillets and was disappointed by the lack of flavor. However,  the red velvet pancakes my friend ordered were great but the rest was left to be desired."}
{"text":"this is our go to restaurant in vegas!!! we love the waitresses here!!! so friendly, laura is great , and samantha in the chinese side  of the restaurant!!! they have great specials, and the food is great,the prices are decent too. mom had the prime rib and stuffed baked potato special for 6.99$ i think. the prime rib was so tender and pretty big!!! really good , the chinese food is great!!! the service is the best ,plus you can watch sports on the tvs as well!!! open 24 hours a day and they also got great desserts and pastries and doughnuts!!!!! and pies!! cant beat this place. cheeseburger special is great!!!! try this place, and all the people working there are so nice, love you guys!!!! thanks for another great time. happy new year 2013  24/7 cafe!!!!! we will be back real soon.!!!"}
{"text":"Stayed at the palms for a night. We visited the cafe twice and both times were very satisfied. The staff was extremely nice, food was good, and when they ran out of something on the pre made menu the chef whipped up a one of one for us on the house. Appreciate the hospitality guys. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Going here after partying in Las Vegas is a must-do. The 24/7 Cafe offers a specialty Hawaiian Egg Breakfast where they serve 3 eggs any style with spam and rice. Where else on the strip can you get spam and eggs at 4am."}
{"text":"After eating at Hooter's we stopped by here (a few feet away) and got some dessert to go. I got a huge cookie for $2.50 and my friend got a slice of chocolate cake, triple layer. It was about $4.50. The chocolate cake looked too sweet, but the lady behind the counter said that it had just been put out, so we thought we would try it. It wasn't too sweet, it was good. Next time I'd want it room temp, it seemed refrigerator cold. Maybe warm it up some? The cookie was perfect! The outer edges had just a small amount of crispness while the rest of it was soft, moist and soooo good. Get the cookie!"}
{"text":"Used their grab and go counter for breakfast during a staycation at the Palms- nonfat latte and a parfait, ~$10. There only seemed to be one employee working for this business at 9AM on a weekday, which was odd. She also had zero personality, but maybe she's not a morning person.  Heads up that their grab and go counter items are made offsite by Sodexho. My $6 strawberry parfait was made with the most sour Greek yogurt I've ever tasted, not the vanilla the label indicated. Tossed most of it, unfortunately. Assorted danishes, fruit cups, muffins, and croissants round out their selection. They offer smoothies in addition to coffee-based beverages."}
{"text":"Disregard my 3-star review! My iPhone flipped out!! I highly recommend this place for brunch any day!! I had the best Eggs Benedict cooked to the way I ordered. It was delicious!!  We are a regular here whenever we are able to visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"Sloooooow service. Normal cafe food. Wouldn't come back unless everything else is closed and I'm hungry"}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch and now it is dinner. As is sit here with my empty drink I would love to be able to review the food but don't think that is going to happen.   I guess it needs to be 5 in the morning to get good service."}
{"text":"What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas? ...not if I have anything to do with it!   I stayed at The Palms during my last visit to Vegas and 24 Seven Cafe was my GO TO spot while I was there.   I took advantage of the specials that started at 10AM and 10PM. You can get a really affordable breakfast for less than $10. One of their breakfast specials included a ham steak, home fries or hash browns, eggs (any which way), AND toast. That's a really hearty breakfast if you want to have a full stomach in order to prepare for all the sightseeing, shopping, etc. you might be planning on doing throughout the day.  Service is decent, but it isn't bad either.   My one helpful tip: Sign up for the Palms card (which is ABSOLUTELY free) and take advantage of the discounts/cheaper prices for every item on the menu. The difference is about a $1 or so for each item, but that really does add up.  I found the options here WAY better than the buffet a few feet down."}
{"text":"Terrible!  Stopped here for a bite tonight before an event.  Disorganized.  Couldn't get a drink, appetizer took 1 hour, food cold.  Terrible.  Get your act together!  Several other tables were complaining about the poor service as well.  Arrived at 6 for an 8:00 show and we had to rush."}
{"text":"Had not been to Vegas in a year. Looked forward to ordering the Monte Crisco again. Ok Actually I dreamed about it.  Soooooooooo I ordered it, waited patiently for it to arrive, and when it did, I dug right in to enjoy it. YUUMMMM! I took about 5 bites (OK I actually inhaled).Then I decided to eat the strawberry that was an edible garnish.  Bit into the strawberry, and a brown crumbly dust fell out of the leafy part of it. I said to myself YUM!! A dusting of chocolate! Dipped my finger into it. AND CRUNCH. Tasted like dirt. WHY?  Because it WAS dirt. It got all over my plate and my lovely, Monte Crisco. Appetite instantly gone.   I promptly, with a heavy heart and sad tummy, told the waitress about the dirt. She was totally sweet about it, and even went and chastised the kitchen about what happened. Without even asking her, the meal was comped, but I left hungry. I did not want to eat anything else from there.  I'm sad, but I don't see myself going there again next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I think my husband and I both got sick from eating here this past Saturday night. I think it was whatever I ordered because I didn't have any of his food but he had some of mine. I ordered the half bbq chicken and had the tomato soup. I basically ate all of the tomato soup with crackers and my husband had some too. My husband also had some of my baked potato and bbq chicken.  The food wasn't great..my husband didn't like his fried chicken..Anyway we both got sick and were in the restroom that night, that morning and on the way back to california..Got home and I had to use the restroom like 6 times...plus I'm pregnant so that wasn't good at all. All I had earlier that day was some hash browns and corned beef and hash and wheat toast..So I'm sure it had to be this place.."}
{"text":"We were greeted by an amazing woman And beyond friendly.  Just an unusual greeting and caught us off guard how polite she was. With that being said, it took forever to get our food and when the prime rib came it tasted awful. It had a sour taste. So that's no big deal, it happens.  Then we wait like what seemed to be an eternity to replace our prime rib with a bowl of soup.  It was very slow here and very few people eating. So I'm trying to figure out why it took twenty more minutes to get soup???? Unbelievable!!! Don't waste ur time here.  And getting the bill so we can get the flock out of here was like pulling teeth."}
{"text":"Hate the Palms. Love the 24/7 Cafe.  Big menu, cheap, lots of seating. The burger was my 12AM savior."}
{"text":"I might go 2.5 stars if that were an option, I might not now that I reconsider how slow the service was. I got there around 11:50 on a Monday morning, so just before lunch time. I stood at the hostess station and watched servers clear tables for a few minutes before anyone came over to seat me.   I sat at the counter by the TVs. While someone came to ask me for a drink order within a reasonable time, I had to wait about 10 minutes for hot tea. And then keep waiting for someone to come take my order. And then wait about 25 minutes after that for a caesar salad with salmon. Which was good, but I had to go fetch myself a knife and fork, because no one on staff ever checked to make sure I had one. The salad was good, but nothing to write home about. And I've definitely had better salads with less waiting.   Did I mention that the place was NOT busy and there were multiple servers working, so no good reason for the significant delays? The staff seemed pleasant, just slower than molasses in January going uphill. Will probably avoid this place in the future, given the plethora of other options close by."}
{"text":"As an employee of the palms I don't recommend this place. every time I order something's wrong. This time they got my order wrong after waiting 25 minutes. Then one of the employees was rude to me like it was my fault. Remade my food with the same fries so they were cold. Great job guys! If this is how you treat employees how the fuck do you treat your guests?"}
{"text":"Great food! A little high priced. The service is TERRIBLE!!! Took forever to even order, then a long time to get our soups... Even longer for entrees... And she forgot my honey mustard... Still waiting..."}
{"text":"I would put No Stars if that was an option. Went to have a late lunch today. Got seated right away as it was not that busy, and that's when things went south in a hurry. Friend ordered Steak and Lobster with Steak Medium Well, I ordered Prime Rib Medium. We also ordered the Spanish Dip Appetizer. 25 minutes after ordering we asked about the appetizer, the server stated she forgot, and 10 minutes later brought it out. 10 minutes later our food finally came out, after watching people who came in after us eat well before us. Food was not cooked how we ordered and it was cold. We were livid after having to wait a long time. Took another 15 minutes for the Manager. She offered to comp us food to go and I said no, knowing full well how bad the food was already. We did take the offer for pastries at the front to go. When we got to the car they even screwed up one of the comp pastries. Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"The service here is very slow.  Been waiting a half an hour for the waitress to bring a refill. The food is decent. I ordered the club sandwich and it wasn't great. Not good considering how hard it is to mess up a club sandwich. My friend order the open face turkey which he wasn't crazy about. Basically a good place to go to for late nite diner food."}
{"text":"There are two pre-requisites for willingly eating here: 1) inebriation that prohibits you from traveling to another place and 2) late night hunger desperation (and the only other thing open in the Palms at the same time is McDonald's).  They have two menus - a standard 24/7 one and a Chinese one. I opted for the Mongolian beef off the Chinese menu. It seemed pretty safe and hard to screw up. I couldn't have been more wrong. I don't think I've ever had greasier food in my life. And at 3:30am after a night of drinking, greasy can be good - but this was all kinds of bad, unappealing greasy.  The service was slow and spotty, despite there being more staff than customers. And it is definitely over-priced. Basically, it was all around poor on every level."}
{"text":"Can't beat 8.99 prime rib. Service was good. Had to eat here twice. Gonna return for late night breakfast!"}
{"text":"Food is adequate, some of it is actually pretty good. They have a Chinese menu which, sadly, seems to be food brought in prepared by outside suppliers. They were out of many choices.  Stayed at hotel for seven days for a trade show. Service was always horrible. I don't know if they are understaffed or don't care, but you have to hunt a server down."}
{"text":"This is a cafe, not a five-star restaurant. But the truth is I've eaten here dozens of times, and the food has always been good. There's a huge variety, from standard cafe fare to Asian cuisine and pretty much everything in between. My friends swear by the red velvet pancakes, and I personally credit their matzo ball soup with vanquishing a demon that had been residing inside my body for several days. The burgers are great (even though I wish they had a blue cheese burger), and the Asian food is good in a pinch (on par with what you'd typically get at a take-out Chinese place). Plus the service is friendly (most of the time), and the variety is practically limitless. Since it's open 24/7, it's the perfect place to end a late night of clubbing or fight off a slight hangover during brunch the next morning. Oh, and did I mention the miraculous matzo ball soup? :D"}
{"text":"My buddy and I were starving at midnight.  He told me that Palms had some hourly deals.    It was true.  They had deals for burgers, steak and eggs.  Pretty nice.  We came in and the place was hardly busy.  It would seem so since it was way late.  We both had steak and eggs.  Size of the T-bone was more than enough.  I asked for medium rare like always and it was cooked properly.  Chow time!  The eggs though weren't so happening for me.  Of course for the price, I shouldn't complain.  Eggs obviously came from a carton.    Service was great and my water was always full.  My buddy had an OJ and he was disappointed.  $4 for such a small glass.  We'll def come back again during one of our random cravings.  They do have other selections to choose from.  And there is a little glass fridge in the front.  I do believe that you can pick up some desserts or so quick and easy."}
{"text":"I love diner food. This is pretty much a good spot to get a burger or some breakfast food when you're in the mood for it. Try the Hawaiian eggs (3 eggs and spam with rice). I ate here @ 3am after being out all night and it hit the spot. Not much on desserts but I would try the NY cheesecake or the 7 layer chocolate cake for only $4. That's a deal."}
{"text":"Below average place to go to after clubbing.  After a long night out, everyone gets the munchies. The only reason to go to this place is because it's open and the it's in the area.   The food here is sub par. There were six of us and all of the entrée were not tasty. How can you screw up on fries???  Good: Hours and vicinity.  Bad: The food should be better.  Final: If you're out late and you're really hungry, order room service."}
{"text":"I don't even think this place deserves a star, but I guess since the waitress kept her cool and never got an attitude...it deserves 1.    Let's just say this place is a perfect example of how ignorant management trickles downs to blah service in every other area.    It was 1am and there were 7 tables of patrons.  We weren't approached for drink orders for 10 minutes and then the busy boy who asked for the order didn't speak engrish well.  lol.  So, I never received a beverage.  Then the waitress came and the only thing I said I can't have is the hamburger bun.  I even made a joke...\"just put the patty on the plate.\" Okay, not so funny.  ANYWAY, as I'm dying of thirst the food finally arrives 40 minutes later and there is the BUN in all it's glory.  I kept my cool and said, they can't just take the meat off because I'll get sick, so it took another 20 (for med rare meat which came out rare).  The manager came over and asked if he could get me a free cocktail.  I asked for tequila with club soda splash of oj.  He brought back a shot.  HAHA.  Problems with engrish from management...NO BUENO.  Eventually, I got the free cocktail which was so strong I could barely drink it.    Overall, HORRIBLE experience and unexpected from the Palms in all it's hyped up glory.  Don't waste your time...In and Out is down the freeway :)"}
{"text":"I was told by someone in the French restaurant, that the cafe is Closed for renovations....how come PALMS doesn't mention that or there isn't signs anywhere??"}
{"text":"alright food,  but my friend got a used fork, and I waited an hour for the forgotten chicken on my salad."}
{"text":"This cafe is always open. They serve really good food.  The soups are delicious.  Be careful because we asked for a grill cheese sandwich which is not on the menu.  It came out to be a whooping $10 bucks.   Is this a price they just make up and throw at the customer when they ask for something that's not on the menu.  I advise you to just order whats on menu because if you don't you will have a surprise on your bill."}
{"text":"Stayed at Palms couple of weeks ago. Late night went to check out the place and grab a quick bite but guess what? Big sign in front saying, \"sorry closed\". Not so 24 seven!"}
{"text":"They're open 24 hours! The prime rib was delicious but took them too long about 20 mins to bring our food. It's inside the casino and not crowded"}
{"text":"We stopped in at 24/7 Cafe strictly for the Prime French Dip Sandwich with melted provolone cheese! Although I thought it was a little pricey, it was very good and the size was worth $10.99!"}
{"text":"I should know better than to go to a place with bad Yelp reviews.  Lesson learned.  I thought that a diner couldn't mess up a basic egg breakfast, but they did.  Service was slow to nonexistent, while people that worked there stood around and talked to each other.  Poached eggs came with the yolk broken and running in the poaching water.  I had to explain to my waiter for 5 minutes why I needed new eggs.  How do you mess up poached eggs?!?  And why would you serve me poached eggs with the yolk running all over?!?  Ah!!!  FML!  Even the bacon and hash browns weren't good.  Heed my warning - don't do it.  I took the bullet so you don't have to."}
{"text":"This is a great casino diner.  All the usual stuff but they also offer some really good entrees. I like their salmon and Thai beef salad. My husband like the Hawaiian eggs, reminds him of his childhood.  They have really good cheap daily specials and prime rib.  Most things can be made gluten free too which I appreciate. Service is usually decent and they are accommodating. This is my go to when coming to the palms."}
{"text":"A friend from out of town was staying at the hotel, so we met early on a Sunday morning. The cafe was busy but not overly crowded, so our server greeted us and took our drink requests immediately. I hadn't seen this friend in four years, so we were excitedly chatty, and had forgotten to actually look at the menu to see what we wanted. Our waitress was patient, and was very kind about us needing another minute before she took our order.   I ordered the chicken and waffles, and my friend ordered the french toast. Our breakfasts arrived at our table quickly, and oh my, was it delicious!  Our city is unfortunately lacking in the chicken and waffles specialty restaurant, but I have found a new favorite spot for this dish specifically. The chicken pieces were huge, but tender and juicy (other places tend too be overly tough and chewy). The waffles were tiny little circles of cute little, amazingly flavorful fluff. Did I mention the maple butter served on the side, and the maple bacon pieces on top? TASTE BUDS BLOWN.   I gobbled my meal up, and because my mouth was full of sweet and salty perfection, my friend did most of the talking. It was the perfect scenario, really. I got to silently satisfy my sweet and salty obsession, all while letting my dear friend fill me in on all the happy things that were going on in her life.  Our waitress once again was very attentive; when I asked for a to go box, she even offered me a to go cup for my iced coffee, and offered another cup of coffee to go in case mine had been watered down from sitting.   It was a struggle ya'll, to take a piece of chicken and waffle home for my son to try. I could have ate it all up that morning at that time. Luckily, my friend had a plane to catch and had to get going, and I figured I'd be the good, kindhearted sweet and salty loving person that I pride myself on, and share a piece of this luscious goodness.   My son enjoyed my leftovers just as much as I did when the meal first came out hot and fresh.  Roscoes, we defy you! We have our very own, special version here, right next to the casino floor at the Palms."}
{"text":"We ate there twice during our weekend....always in the middle of the night : )  The french dip kicked butt & so did the cheeseburger.  The only reason this place isn't getting 5 stars is that the ambience could be a little cooler.  The late night diner at Hard Rock has always been a fave of mine ....such a cool little spot, you could even imagine having actual dinner here.  I'd never go to 24/7 for actual dinner....it's just too lacking in atmosphere.  BUT, as I swore to never again walk into Hard Rock Hotel again (they are jerks, plain & simple....most reviews agree w/ me!!)  I will not be back to their cafe.  24/7 gets an enthusiastic thumbs up, and I'm sure we'll somehow end up back here again..... : )"}
{"text":"This was a late night stop on a drunk night with friends. It was pretty late so as you would expect the service wasn't top notch actually they left us alone most of the time even when we needed refills. I would've given this a 3 star but the food that we had was so delicious. We shared a lobster mac and cheese with a philly cheesesteak. The cheesesteak was what you would expect. Nice and fresh, but the lobster mac and cheese was to die for. My mouth still waters when I mention it"}
{"text":"If you stayed up 'til 5am after clubbing all night at the Palms and gambled away all your money, this place would be a perfect spot to grab a bite to eat and relax for a while before crashing back at the hotel room.  Not too expensive, quiet, fast, decent quality.  And they served a Hawaiian breakfast...very rare to find.  2 eggs, fried, on top of a bowl of rice and 3 slices of spam.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"Super convenient cafe located at the Palms Casino and Hotel. Great breakfast, simple menu.  This is where the room service food comes from but cheaper if you eat at the cafe.  The food and service was great! My eggs were cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"NEVER EVER GO HERE!  Awful customer service, simply dismal. Terrible attitudes...   Because of their attitudes I will never stay here again.  Pitiful.  (ref other reviews, there are several that talk about bad customer service, this was NOT a one-time experience..)  If you want to be treated nice, and have a nice breakfast in a nice atmosphere take the sky walk to Palms Place and eat at Simons."}
{"text":"Cafe has totally changed and service has gotten soooooo slow. I dont know why it takes so long for your food to come out. Breakfast was ok though."}
{"text":"Located in the Palms, its the much needed 24 hour food station. Perfect for those late night drunken eats or mid morning wtf did I do last night brunch, 24/7 cafe does an okay job at it.  I got the steak and eggs which came with hash browns and two biscuits. I opted for a side of gravy for my biscuits.  The food itself was decent, minus the hash browns. The steak could have used some salt but it was cooked medium rare. It wasn't the best, but 8oz NY strip w/ eggs n other stuff for 8.99 isn't a bad deal.   They have a wide range of food, everything you can possibly think of. They even have a chinese food menu? I would never order off of that but im Chinese and would never even think of eating that.   Overall not too bad but not great, would come again if I was at the hotel looking for grub between the hours of 5am and 8am."}
{"text":"The food was decent, but I don't think I've ever had bitchier service. The girls were catty and unhelpful.   First of all, the front of the restaurant says something about take-out. The menu mentioned it, too. I never imagined that would be a problem.  I wanted to order take-out. I waited in line for a while (because there was no hostess to tell me otherwise), and had obviously just come in from the casino (i.e. NOT paying my tab). I got to the front and asked to place a to go order. The cashier told me extremely rudely that I would need to go sit at a counter to get service and THEN ask my waitress to take my to go order. Really? Fine. Whatever.  Then I waited 30 minutes for a waitress. The cashier and another server walked past me several times, I even asked to place my order a couple of times, they both told me they weren't my server.   My server finally came. I placed my order and asked if she could bring me the check so I could pay while I waited. No dice. She said she'd bring me the check when she brought me the food.  I waited another 25 minutes or so for my food (not a huge deal, I was just already annoyed at this point), and then had to remind her that it was a to go order and have it repackaged as take-out.   Then, when she brought it back, I had to ask again for the check. Waited quite a while for that. To the point that my food was definitely cold before I got it.  Then I had to wait in line to pay (again).  Too many amazing places in Vegas to deal with this."}
{"text":"This place isnt anything to write home about.  I had the lobster and crab coob salad.  Was pretty bland and the service was slow.  If your drunk and its late, I guess it would do."}
{"text":"Make sure you get that Palms Club card to save some payola here. The only reason I would recommend dining here would be for the club prices.  The food was ordinary at best. What follows is my late night breakfast experience. Though the strips of bacon were on the smallish side, they were prepared with a good blend of tenderness/crunchiness, with an average taste. i ordered my eggs scrambled soft, and they were prepared perfectly. I ordered wheat toast; the bread thickness was in-between the norm and Texas toast. The last item, the home fries, were unbearable. In my travels home fries are typically not fried potato bits, as these were. and as such, the taste was more grease than potato."}
{"text":"Overpriced Denny's.....the food wasn't bad, but it wasn't great, and the prices were outrageous for what we were getting. The service however was amazing. I say this because we showed up here the first time at 4am drunk and the waiter was not only humorous, but was very attentive to my drunken ramblings. We went back sober, so I can with all confidence say hat food isn't amazing, although the french fries at 4am were pretty clutch. PS...not that this is a bad thing for a sober person, but that menu is daunting, to say the least, when you are drunk. I mean, so many choices, and I'm indecisive...yikes"}
{"text":"The big highlight about the food for this place is the food portions were not a joke, especially that country fried steak.  After a night at the tables, the bars/clubs you have to refuel before the after-party, and that country fried steak was huge.  I wanted a beer with my food, they didn't have it at the restaurant so they went to the bar on the casino floor somewhere and got it for me.  The food wasn't that great, but at this point of the night after I am down couple hundred bucks I was willing to give it 4 stars except I wanted a glass of water the whole time I was there and it never came.  I was enjoying my beer but a glass of water at that time of the night would have helped."}
{"text":"Very good service, they have Vegas specials from 10am-10pm. Prime rib special is sweet. The salads are big. Chinese food is well prepared. Overall excellent & enjoy it before people catch on."}
{"text":"OMG. One of my worst experiences. Had visitors from Cali and Europe that were heading home so I suggested to stop at The Palms cafe for breakfast which I've been to. We were a party of 5 and stood at the Host table 10 minutes before even recognized. Well every meal should of been sent back except the oatmeal. So understaffed for a Friday morning and when we left I mentioned my disappointment to the manager and he didn't seem to care. A letter will follow to the food and beverage Mgr."}
{"text":"Hate to see this place slipping.  They are now going by the motto: \"If it's not broken, let's fix it.\" Their once hearty portion of prime rib has now been reduced to a so so slab, and it was rather dried out today.  Currently, the prime rib is on special for $11.99 with a Palms players card, and that includes a side of veggies, and a baked potato.   With the Palms changing anything and everything just for the sake of change, I'm not sure how long that 7 day a week special will last!"}
{"text":"Had to wait 35 minutes for a burger, then another 15 for my check. Understaffed VERY SLOW SERVICE. Food was marginal at best. With so many great places in Las Vegas to eat I would not waste any time at this place again."}
{"text":"$7.99 prime rib = win. Buffalo wings not bad.. it's connected to Fortunes and on Fridays they have $6.99 broccoli beef special which is ok as well.  When nothing else is open it's not a bad place to go..  Service is abysmal... most of the hostesses are ummm... how to put it politely.. rude.  They also have krispy kreme donuts for $1.50 plus tax for all of the flavours.."}
{"text":"This is a nice little restaurant in the Palms Casino.  Stopped in there late one night since we didn't feel like going out of the casino to eat.  They certainly have a wide variety of cafe/diner fare including breakfast, burgers, salads, sandwiches, apps, and entrees.  Multiple specials are also available, based on the day, and the time of day.  If you don't have a Palms Player's Card, get one.  It's free and gets you discounts as well as other casino perks.    Don't ask my why, but ended up ordering the grilled cheese sandwich with fries.  This is SO against my 'dining out' code for more reasons than one, mostly because I consider myself quite an awesome grilled cheese sandwich maker.  (my wife will gladly attest to that fact)  That being said, it was a pretty darn good grilled cheese.  Made with american, provolone,and pepper jack on thick sourdough bread, grilled just right.  My son got macaroni and cheese with lobster.  It was $2 extra to add chicken, beef, or lobster, so he wasn't surprised when it wasn't \"real\" lobster.  However, it was still tasty, gooey, cheesey, and a huge portion.  If you are looking for something quick with a variety of choices at really reasonable prices, check this place out.  And like the name says, they are open 24/7."}
{"text":"This is middle of the road good.  Service is sparse and slow but you do get the food.  Bacon and eggs, hash browns, English muffin, OJ and berry bowl.  The bacon was average and everything else was fine but not spectacular.  Eat breakfast at The Hotel or Wynn and it's much better.  Bellagio too."}
{"text":"Friday Febuary 20th we were seated at 5:05 PM.   Came here for a light lunch for the late afternoon.   I'm trying the Build your own Omelet - $12.50.   I ordered Bacon, Mushroom with Mozzarella Cheese.   We sat down over 20 minutes, food was hot & flavorful bacon.    Herbs & spices. Loved how fancy the dish was.  Even my friend's Salmon - $14.95, she thought it was fantasticly seared.  We had comps 2 for 1 entrées at the cafe so it worked out well. With the shorter menu the service has picked up the pace.  Food came out under 23 minutes. Better than the 35 minute wait times from a year ago. I took a picture of the Specials if interested, take a look."}
{"text":"This place was good for a late night (or early morning) bite.  It's pretty much typical diner food and they don't have a lot of selection.  (Though they do have a late night Chinese menu which I thought was completely weird!)  The only issue I had with this place was that it took FOREVER to get our food!  I don't know if it was cuz we were starving or what, but it the service seemed really really slow!  Other than that, it's just your typical 24 hour place."}
{"text":"This review is for the after theatre crowd. They don't expect you! They seemed surprised that people show up at midnight to have the munchies in Veags! ???????? We waited a while to be seated, waited longer to get a drink order in, and mused about how they must be growing the corn for the nachos. Ah well, it's Vegas, Baby! Just don't come ravenous to this place, you'll be hangry.   I don't fault anyone except the person who schedules the shifts. Breakfast hours are much more predictable. No problems there."}
{"text":"My husband and I came for dinner here for the prime rib.  I can't count on one hand how many times we saw our waiter and believe me I was extremely upset.  When we arrived, the place was busy, but not packed.  So imagine my surprise when 45 minutes have passed and we still don't have our food!  I cannot remember the last time I waited so long for my food.      The food was definitely less than mediocre. The vegetables needed to be cooked a tad bit longer, my husband ordered his prime rib medium rare and got it medium well,"}
{"text":"very disappointing, they no longer offer a seniors menu, or a players card discounted menu, or the $5.99 burger or bkfst.specials  ...All gone,  way way too dark, horrible tater chesse tots.(they use fake salty cheese sauce from a can) Chicken and waffles @$13.00 is a joke and a rip-off. french fries were cold and hard, everything came out cold or lukewarm.  However great service and waitstaff.   $40.00 down the drain...Fruit plate @ $8.00 was very good and fresh, but I guess you cant really fck-up fruit now can ya......"}
{"text":"Arturo was our server and he was not very attentive at all. His service was very poor to where we  were able to see he didnt want to serve us. Water didnt get filled in a timely manner and our food was quite a wait. Need be said, the restaurant was not busy. The food here is average . Chilli was way to salty. And we had to return it and u can yell that upset him. Dont go here unless u have a better server."}
{"text":"Wanted to order for to go. lady told me to have a seat at the counter and that they would take my order. From the moment I sat down I became invisible. The server came over in front of me and complains about a guy lighting a match to sing his friend happy birthday. I'm still invisible."}
{"text":"First night at the Palms, grabbed a quick meal here. We decided to share a \"prime rib french dip\" and an order of \"mixed vegetables.\"  Why the quotation marks? Well, I'll tell you...\"She's going to tell...She's going to tell...\" (Monty Python reference. Just ignore me.)  The sandwich was more fat than meat, and the meat was so overcooked it was practically cremated. Pretty darn icky.   The \"mixed\" vegetables was a big, giant plate of broccoli.   Service was slow as well."}
{"text":"The service was slow (they weren't that busy and we still had to wait around 45 minutes for our food) and menu overpriced (but it's Vegas, I know).   I got the Lemon Butter Shrimp and I absolutely HATED it.  My pasta was drowned in an unappetizing lemon sauce and the pasta was clumped together and not fresh looking/tasting at all.  Eventually I just ate the shrimp, after dipping it in marinara sauce.   I had a couple of bites of my friends' dishes and the only thing half decent was the prime rib and the sauteed spinach.  Everything else was not as appetizing as we had hoped, not even close !   YUCK !!"}
{"text":"Well let me start from the service!!! My waitress GLORIA IS VERY RUDE AND BOSSY, my dear you are in the wrong business, your actitud is very crapy, you should be working at a zoo with animals where you belong!! Probably you dont like work late nights o who knows whats your problem, but you dont have any finesse and delicacy to interact with your customers, what a shame. People pay money to eat and tip !! But you don't deserve it because of your manners very RUDE. Now lets talk about the food. I order NY MEDIUM!! Come out RARE, when i told GLORIA she gave me a nasty look like im her employee or I'm looking for a free dish, then my pancakes come out burned!! If you are a server you know BETTER check your food before you take it to the tables RIGHT??? Also i ask her for a hot drink. She replied, i don't know if we have?? Ok she comeback with a coffe so DAMMMMM STRONG!! I cant even drink it, but remember i said hot drink !!! Dint order witch one yet cause she dint know if hot drinks are available, but she serve it anyways, i dint want to make an scene cause im very nice person i just want to get out ASAP from there!! Ok all this happened at the bistro buffet cause the 24/7 caffe closed for the night and they open for a late menu. BUT IM SURE THE WHOLE STAFF WAS FROM 24/7 caffe where GLORIA works regularly. Please people avoid this waitress if you want to enjoy a meal. To bad for you GLORIA im a server my self and i know all yours mistakes. I will make a formal complaint at the food and beverage management from the PALMS CASINO. So they can deal with yourself and manners."}
{"text":"Haven't visited in awhile, but looks like they changed the menu and dining area looks updated.  They offer specials if you have a Palm's club card like prime rib.  Dined here on weekday evening with a friend before a movie and we ordered chicken and waffles, sweet potato fries, and I opted for the salmon dinner.  Order was processed immediately upon seating and food was served shortly after.  The food was OK for price as we had coupon buy 1 entree get 1 free, but don't know if I would return and pay full price for these items.  Food and service was good."}
{"text":"Came in on a Tuesday night and 10pm we were the only people in here eating. Have to say hands down the freshest food and quality food especially for being so late. Started with the spinach artichoke dip very well prepared. Then had the fish and chips and the starter platter. Amazing fried pickle spears must try. Our server was Andrea she was amazing and attentive. Definitely recommend this place. Try it atleast"}
{"text":"Better than the buffet and much better than some cafes on the strip-  get the Hawaiian Breakfast.  Orange Juice sucks-  not fresh as advertised-  naked bottled."}
{"text":"If you like partying at the clubs on the strip, there's a good chance you'll pass by this place on your way out of Moon, Rain, or the Ghostbar. There's also a good chance that you'll have some major late night munchies and find yourself inexplicably drawn to this establishment calling to you ever so seductively.  A large group of us tried it out and sampled bits of eachothers orders. The chinese food didn't really impress me. You'd be better off going to a high end sit down place during dinner hours...but of course, you don't really have that luxury at 3:30 in the morning. Not bad, but it sure doesn't taste the least bit authentic to me.   The omelettes seemed ok to me. Big and loaded, just the way you'd expect it to be. I'm sure you'll have no complaints in the state of mind that you will most likely be when ordering it.   I tried the burger and fries. Honestly not impressed. The burger was a bit dry and not seasoned particularly well. I found myself throwing ketchup onto the beef patty (something I never do). The fries were good, no complaints there. And honestly, the service was pretty mediocre as well. The server was not particularly attentive to our orders, nor accommodating to various requests. They weren't mean by any stretch, but they just seemed rather apathetic. I guess I can't blame you if you're working the third shift.  Bottom line: would I have us go back in a similar situation? I probably would have opted to have us taxid to a late night pho place, or even South Point for their killer steak and eggs deals, instead."}
{"text":"Good food, good prices, decent service. All the people who gave it a bad review are nuts. it was right in our hotel so that made it easy. But the service was a little slow."}
{"text":"After coming back to my room at the Palms I was really hungry. According to my buddy I came back to my room around 6 am with a pizza. I have no idea where this pizza came from so I figured I better go out to eat.   Went here and it was the best thing. I ordered myself a T-bone steak. This steak was huge. Seasoned perfectly and juicy. The portions for the fries and vegetables were huge.   Service was good. I was able to sit down quickly and they came with my drink right away. Food seemed to take a while to come but that might have been because I was still drunk.   This is a good restaurant and I would recommend coming here anytime you want."}
{"text":"Food is over-priced and ok at best. Seemed like they only had 1 waitresses working although she was polite and attractive. Get it together!!!"}
{"text":"First night at the palms and it was 9pm (this place is open 24/7) and me and the bf was starving so we went here. He got the wings which were average and I got a chicken club sandwich which was pretty good not dry at all. The staff was friendly but it was a little over priced even with the palms card. I was a little annoyed we were placed next to a guy that was very loud on his phone for about 20mins, dude step out and take your call."}
{"text":"A diner in the middle of the Palms, it's got a few TVs, and a decent-sized menu that fits the tastes of the quick-bite crowd.  Coffee and more for most people here. Service was fair, prices were about normal for someone coming from NY (probably expensive otherwise).   Definitely filling. Best part was the massive slices of sourdough toast that you can ask for.  And of course, as their name has it, open 24-7."}
{"text":"This used to be a good place to eat 24/7 if you don't want to eat at the food court at Palms. They got specials if your a guest at the hotel. You could get shrimp and steak for $10 and a burger and fries for under $7. The food was quite good, plenty of options for breakfast, I like their waffles, scrambled eggs and sausage..This is A good deal. This place kind of reminds me of Mel's diner unfortunately, they remodeled it recently and change the name to lucky penny."}
{"text":"This was a great cafe. Had the bone in rib eye steak cajun style. Great flavor and cooked just right. Had the sliders to start. Great service at 1:30AM. It was a good meal at a fair price."}
{"text":"They call this place 24/7 for a reason...  I think any food after a night of going to two nightclubs in Vegas and having some alcohol in your system tastes good.  We came here a little after 2am and our waitress didn't lag on taking our orders and the food came immediately.   I couldn't ask for a better egg's benedict this late into the night, or should I say so early in the morning? I loved how the poached eggs floated atop the English muffin halves with a slice of ham in between, all drenched in hollandaise sauce.  It sounds fatty, and I'm sure it is, but heck, I was on vacation.  It was served with hash browns, which I could have done without.  A couple of my friends ordered from the Chinese menu...how cool is that...a place that serves your typical American breakfast-type food and also gives you oriental options.  But being Chinese, I didn't really care to glance at what was offered or to order any of the dishes since I eat it every time I visit home.  Though from the looks of what my friends ordered, the dishes looked pretty decent and the servings were a good portion size.    If you're ever in the Palms Casino, do come by here for a late bite, after all, they are open 24/7 for a reason."}
{"text":"Late night food prepared with no regard. HUGE menu with a lot of options, but it's just not very good. I've had quite a few things on the menu. But hey, if it's late and you just need food- food is served quick and they seem to be pretty helpful towards the intoxicated."}
{"text":"GREAT LATE NIGHT DRUNK FOOD.  If you're looking for the right price point (about $10), a place to eat at in the wee hours of the morning because you've been partying all night at the Palms - def hit this place up. It's the only thing open around at 5-6am. It's better than Denny's and it's convenient. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and found that to work out for my hangover the next morning as well. lol.."}
{"text":"We were skeptical about eating here because of the mixed reviews. Glad to say that or meals were good, nothing special. We each had omelettes which came with a choice of home fries or fruit per the menu but our waitress didn't ask which we wanted. Omelettes had enough fillings but I don't like my omelette to be cooked to the stage where the eggs are golden brown and two of our omelettes where cooked to that point and one was even more brown.  Other than that service was fairly prompt, the setting is modern and spacious. There is also a takeout counter before you enter the restaurant which had a good selection of baked goods and pastries and also offered various beverages (hot and cold).   Pricing for breakfast was higher than what one would expect for LV but acceptable."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 8 for steak and eggs night...waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay overpriced! and for such a small and thin looking piece of steak. Can you say rip off! The cafe wasn't even half full and they mixed up my order with another person in our party, they ordered med-rare and i ordered med...why can' t service be more accurate with their details on orders? Was serving our group really too much for them to handle? Have you seen other cafes?  Head over to one of the $5 or less steak and egg spots...the service and quality are far more superior.  Pricier does not always mean better. Never again."}
{"text":"This cafe is just like any other cafe in a casino.  It serves food, and the food tastes good after you've rolled out of whatever club you were partying at.  Be careful, as one time I came here at like 2am and they told me it was the one day that month that they were closed for cleaning.  Don't know if they do that, but that was not a happy day for me."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this restaurant and the pancakes were AMAZING!!!! highly recommend at least there pancakes."}
{"text":"I sure wish the service wasn't as bad as many other reviewers have said. With better service this could be a solid place. As it is, It's only real value is that it's in the hotel, and it's not the buffet.  Considering how solid the food is, the large portions, and the nice atmosphere, it could be worth seeking out. As it is, it fills a niche if you are staying here."}
{"text":"What is it about the Palms buffet that there's always a line when I am going there.  So many people complain about it, you'd think I could walk right in.  Instead, I went once again to the 24/7 Café.  I ordered their prime rib special that comes with vegetable and either mashed or loaded baked potato.  I ordered the beef extra rare and that's the way it came.  Sure, this place isn't Lawry's but the meat was excellent and the potato and broccoli were very good.  For dessert, I got a piece of chocolate cake.  You can't ever pass that up.  I removed one star from my 5 star earlier review because service wasn't that good.  When I first got there, the place was almost empty, and even then, I had to flag down servers for an iced tea refill.  Later when it was much busier, I still had to flag down the server to get my check.  It almost was a casino comp."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious breakfast While staying at palms place for my birthday! The staff was very polite and good was delicious!"}
{"text":"food is reasonably priced.   food comes out quick.   kobe beef meatloaf was good. if i remember right it cost 12.99 or 11.99.   the combo chow mein was delicious too!    coors light cost 5.00! not a bad price either  i will come back!"}
{"text":"A decent place to get breakfast at the Palms. The service was quick, the staff was friendly. We ordered the pancakes - they were delicious and the portion was extra large. We also ordered a couple of over medium eggs, hash browns and wheat toast, a standard breakfast. It was as you would expect it to be, prices were reasonable for Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is located in the Palms Casino. They have American Food, Chinese Food, and is open 24 hours.  Their Dim Sum is actually quite good.  Blue Corn Chicken Nachos are great too. hah."}
{"text":"We only went for breakfast during our stay there. The breakfast are really, really good. Try the egg benedict or the egg white omelette with spinach and tomatoes. I also tried the wheat pancakes. Make sure you ask for a short stack otherwise you will get at least 5 pancakes (huge). All plates are very delicious. Their lunch and dinners look amazing as well but we didn't try. As the name states, the restaurant is open 24/7 so you can enjoy any meal at any time of day. Well worth it and the prices are decent. One thing to point out is the service. The 1st and 2nd time we went the waiters were fast and friendly. The last time was Monday morning. The waitress was friendly but she took a long time with getting to our table and the food took a long time so we ate fast. We had to be at the convention center by 9 am. So if you're in a hurry make sure you let them know and they can tell you how long your order will take."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I've only been here after midnight. I can only imagine that the service and food would be different at a peak time.   But oh my gosh, I am in love with this food. We only got chicken fingers, spinach artichoke dip, and fries but all of it was the best I have ever tasted of its kind. And I've been twice. Gourmet? Not so much. But I go for tasty and hot. And this place always delivers."}
{"text":"Good place to go and chill out after a night of partying at the top floors of the Palms.  After a so-so evening at Moon, Ghost Bar, and Playboy Club, my friends and I came here to grab a quick bite before taking a taxi back to the strip.   Clarisse C. and I split a Hawaiian breakfast which can also be named a Filipino breakfast. It was 2 slices of Spam with eggs aka my childhood Saturday morning breakfast. Can't really comment more on this; it was what it was.  Prices were reasonable and service was standard. Don't come here for a formal meal; come here to eat to soak up the booze in your system at 2am."}
{"text":"The slowest service ever. The manager guy also talked down to his employee when she was explaining to us that they have to wait for the manager to break out check. The food was okay but that does not make up for the poor service and a manager who looked like he hated his job. Skip this place if you're looking to eat at the Palms. It'll save you the trouble."}
{"text":"Two stars at best.  Service was slow and poor. Food was marginal at best. Came here in hopes of being quick and decent and was disappointed on both accounts. Pass on this place no matter how hungry or tired you might be."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here at 5 in the morning after dancing all night in the clubs inside the Palm. The waitress was very nice and put up with my loud, obnoxious, drunk, and messy friends for a few hours without any attitude at all...being the only sober person at the table I was very impressed with her composure. The potato skins and the fries were really good."}
{"text":"Located inside The Palms Hotel Casino. This is their 24 hour coffee shop. The food is great the service wonderful. And the bargains are abundant. Prime Rib Dinner for $6.99 T-Bone Steak and Eggs $7.99 just to name a few. They get fresh Krispy Kream Donuts everyday. I should also mention an expansive array of dim sum. Worth the trip off strip. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly good.  The chinesse chicken salad, artichoke dip, and wings are awesome.  The country fried chicken... Not so much!  price was not bad! Will come again:)"}
{"text":"We got the chicken & waffles and a grilled cheese sandwich. I was quite impressed since it didn't seem that special of a restaurant, but my judgement could be biased since I didn't eat all day.   Service is very important to a restaurant, so for that reason I'm giving this place 2 stars. We were seated far away from the rest of the crowd, in a secluded corner. The waitresses were just in a circle of three talking to one another in the front of the restaurant. Tired of waving our hand around, my bf got up to call the waiters over. They told him \"can you just wait for us to come over there?\" ... Excuse me...? We've been trying to get your attention for the past 5 minutes while you guys are talking amongst yourselves instead of doing your job, and now you're giving us attitude? Such a disappointment since their food is actually good."}
{"text":"We were back again to the 24/7 after the completion of the Big Air Bash.  This time, however, was not near as good of an experience.  The place was only about half full, yet we had to wait over 20 minutes because they were short staffed.  This is not my problem and it should not effect my experience in any way.  Once we were sat our server was friendly and attentive.  The food was ok.  It is what you would expect from a 24 hour cafe.  I did the build your own omelette.  It came with ample ingredients, but I needed to add hot sauce to give it more flavor."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of coffee shops, but this place is great! My first day I had the egg white omlette. But, my second day I just could not pass up the Corn Flake French Toast, Fresh Fruit, and Ham Steak. The french toast was perfect! Some crunch, but not overly sweet. I was served with fresh fruits of strawberries, melons, and grapes. Many times you order the side of ham and its a dried up piece of salty cardboard. Not this one - it was juicy, tender, and not salty at all - loved the ham! Lastly, I noticed some other cool items that I wanted to try (but did not get a chance) not typically found on a \"coffee\" shop menu like; crepes. I really wanted to try one...maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes before a server spoke to me - the man who sat down 10 minutes after me has gotten his food and is almost done and I still am waiting on my first course - food better be fucking stellar ?!?!? Not going to tip and might even get up and leave if my food doesn't come out soon - never again - if I had a flight to catch they would have ruined my trip - new management maybe or some - oh shot waffles are cold - worst one -"}
{"text":"I was cranky when I came in here ....this hardly ever happens to me ...so I 'll just stick to the facts. I really wanted to go to the buffet but I don't always get my way so we came here to eat.   They have a wide variety of food ...they even have an extensive Chinese menu . In the past I did try their Strawberry Chicken which was really delish! I've been trying to eat healthier lately so I begrudgingly stayed away from the Chinese menu. I really wanted some fried rice but I soldiered on.   I had their BLT which is out of my norm but I was trying to follow Weight Watchers Point System. Since this didn't have that many ingredients it was easier for me to break everything down to points. I chose Multigrain bread for the sandwich. It of course had Bacon ...wasn't greasy or salty . It also had the lettuce and Tomato...with no Mayonnaise. It was a pretty basic sandwich but it was really good for what it was."}
{"text":"Unfortunately for me, I had the bad luck of coming here twice in one night.  The first was for a late dinner.  We ordered from the Chinese Menu.  For some reason, all the Chinese food I've ever had in Vegas casinos suck ass.  Even Panda makes better food than this.  We both got two different noodle soups.  They weren't horrible, but they definitely weren't very good.  Both had a salty soup broth that had a slightly odd taste that I cannot describe.  Later that night, around 3 a.m., we had to wait at least fifteen minutes for a table and another half an hour for our food.  You would think they'd know by now to hire more help during the after clubbing hours, but I guess not.  I had the nachos, which were cold and gross.  The chicken noodle soup had no chicken.  Someone ordered biscuits and gravy, which also came cold.  The only plate that was decent was the spam, rice, and eggs bc that one is almost impossible to screw up.  I gave it an extra star for the convenience of being open 24/7 and having a variety items on the menu to choose from (although if they all taste like crap, what is the point?)."}
{"text":"I have THREE words for you: spam & eggs.   Yup, they serve that here. For those of you who know what's up...THAT'S what's up. It's damn expensive, but hey, you are in Vegas after all. And that whore will take you for all you're worth.   But at least you can still have your comfort foods or alcohol absorbing delicacies 'round the clock!"}
{"text":"My recent trip to Born And Raised (BAR) had me thinking about this cafe inside the Palms. For me, it's just a regular, run-of-the-mill casino café with one exception - the Open Faced Hot Turkey Sandwich.  Quite simply, it's in a class on its own.The way everything comes together is just divine. If you're looking for Thanksgiving in a sandwich, this is it. If I remember correctly, the plate comes with your two slices of bread, hot turkey and gravy, stuffing, and mashed potatoes and gravy. The cranberry sauce comes in a bowl on the side. You even get a side of steamed vegetables. All this for only $8.99. (I hope I'm not forgetting anything).  To be honest, I think most of the items in this cafe are overpriced. But with this turkey sandwich available, I don't even bother looking at the menu any more. I'm giving the place five stars based on the turkey sandwich alone. The café overall is probably worth a three."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stayed at the palms and had breakfast at this cafe. Our server was quick, food was fresh and prices were great. After our meal, the chef came out and chatted with us and made us feel comfortable and we would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"This was our first bite to eat in Vegas and we invited all of our friends on our group trip to meet us here before heading out for the evening.  We came down from our room and walked up to the reception area.  We noticed they had some beer and wine and headed for our table.  A server came up and we tried to order beers but, she said we couldn't but, honestly we were having a hard time understanding her then she said she would go get our server.  That's a bit confusing and he came up and said sure I can get that for you but normally you order them from over there.  Um ok that seems odd.  The other thing that was odd is the name on the menus didn't match the restaurant name on the sign in the front.  I settled for a corona because it was either that or bud light, miller lite or Budweiser.  He came back with my beer and told me they didn't have any limes because it was the last night they would be open before renovations.  Some time later he came back with fresh limes from another bar/restaurant.  Our friends joined us and we finally ordered.  We ordered chips and caramelized onion dip to start and my friend and I shared chicken fingers.  The dip was amazing and really reminded me of the onion dip you get in the Midwest.  The chicken fingers really stole the show.  I don't know what type of breading they use or if there is a marinade on them before they bread them but dang they were the best chicken fingers of my life.  From what the server told us they won't open for 4 months with the new restaurant which will be greatly improved but, I hope they keep that chicken finger recipe for when I come back.  I sincerely hope the service improves though."}
{"text":"Party of 10.. we got seated right away after a great time at Moon.  Decent american food. We ordered a bacon cheeseburger and clam chowder soup. Burger was kinda dry. Needed a lot of condiments. Clam chowder was average. It wasn't thick and flavorful as I would have liked it to be. Had a lot of potatoes. Should have called it potato soup. Other than american they have chinese food! Chinese as a late night snack AWESOME! My cousin order fried rice, fried wontons, chicken and beef. I must say very good. Had heat, tang, spicy, salty and yummy all in one bit. Order chinese you wont be disappointed.  Service was ok. Late night so service is a hit or miss. Luckily our table was near the service doors so we got our waiters attention fast."}
{"text":"You go to this place when you are good and drunk and have lost all your money.  Otherwise, I'd pick a different location to get your grub on. Not too impressed. Just ordinary"}
{"text":"Great cafe in the Palms Hotel and Casino.  Check out their specials.  Service is not 100% (or they would have received another star), but the specials are a great deal.  Nice atmosphere and friendly (if not attentive) staff."}
{"text":"An affordable 24 hour cafe on the strip & with decent food!  Me & my (mostly) drunken crew came here the first nite in LV after an okay nite at Ghostbar & Moon (see my other reviews...ehhh stalkerish guys at the club).    I decided on the unusual corn flake french toast (a la carte) for about $6.  It was yummy.  The other b-day girl was totally raving about her big chicken fried steak breakfast..all for under $9 (yeeah she was super drunk).  Everyone seemed to enjoy their food; even those that weren't totally drunk.    One thing we all found weird though, how come we had to have one waiter take our drink order (tap water) & one to take our actual food order?"}
{"text":"As far as 24 hour cafe's go around here, I'm a fan of the Palms 24/7 Cafe.  They have a pretty good Chinese food menu late night and the sandwiches are tasty too.  I've never had to wait in a long line and the food always comes quick.  One time, I ordered beef chow mein and it came out with no beef in it, but the server was quick to fix it and the manager came over to apologize.  He gave us a discount and we were totally pleased.  The wait staff is attentive, even on busy nights and always treat you well.   The wall of TVs is cool, especially to watch the game while you dine.    Love it!"}
{"text":"The 24/7 became a frequent stop for us during business meetings in the Palms Casino.    We enjoyed Breakfast and Lunch there.    Breakfast  - Great Omelettes, and FABULOUS biscuits and gravy! Lunch - Great Reuben sandwiches. !"}
{"text":"So have you ever been to prison? Well if have good for you because that means you have had way better food than what this fake food emporium is selling. Like if you were in Tijuana and munching garbage out of the gutter you first thought would be well at least its not that 24 seven food. Like if there is a rock bottom this place is that place without trying. Actually i take that back to make food this bad you have to TRY for real. Their food is like someone lost a bet with the devil and they are unleashing that bet on unsuspecting customers. But to be honest anyone going to a 24 hour café in an off strip casino should know what they are getting themselves into. . Like seriously shame on you. But all things considered our biggest beef was the lack of booze. Like wtf we are at 24 hour café in off strip casino at 4pm and you don't have booze!? I can stand your eggs Benedict that isn't even fit for prisoners at auchswitz but no booze?! Unacceptable 1 star!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites since before the remodel. I always loved stopping here after one of my many marathon poker sessions at the Palms before there were 34 poker rooms on the west side.   The addition of the Cathay House is a nice option as the original CH is ALWAYS packed.   Good food, good service."}
{"text":"We stayed at the palms last weekend and wandered in this Cafe on Friday for dinner.  They have an $8.99 special for the prime rib dinner.  So we though why not!  Service was fast and efficient.  The prime rib was EXCELLENT.  I have paid over $40 for prime rib not half that good.  We went back on Sunday and had breakfast.  Seriously one of the best Chicken friend steaks I have ever had.  YUM!    We couldn't resist and we went back for lunch for the Prime rib.    GREAT JOB!"}
{"text":"Thought I'd try the Palms 24 hour cafe  at 5 in the morning .  Ordered the Palms Signature Steak - big mistake ,  It was a grisly steak covered in a velvita type cheese sauce & the potato was a dried up hard brick.  Very disappointing meal not worth the money .  I kept thinking I should send this back, but made myself eat it anyway.  If this is your signature meal, the rest of the menu must be terrible.  One of Adrienne Maloofs shoes would taste better."}
{"text":"Ordered a medium rare burger. Thirty minutes later, it came out well done. They weren't even somewhat busy. Walked out, never again. Better off wth the fast food offerings or snacking on what you can find on the casino floor carpet."}
{"text":"We went straight to the Palms after arriving into LAS as we saw a billboard luring us to get their $6.99 Steak and Eggs.  When we were seated, we were looking through their menu and couldn't find their special anywhere until we asked our server.  Apparently, the specials aren't on the menu, it's actually on a tent card at every table except ours so she brought us one.  They have a few specials, including the Steak and Eggs that are available everyday and they have a daily special.  We totally went for the Steak and Eggs, can't beat that price!  It took just over 20-minutes before we were served our food.  Not sure what the hold up was, they had tons of servers/bussers and the restaurant was practically empty, maybe they needed to grab our breakfast straight from the farm...wouldn't that be nice...keep dreaming.  When our food came, I have to say it was pretty decent.  The steak, although not quite being classified as USDA Prime, it certainly fixed my steak craving.  It was also accompanied with hash browns, two eggs and toast or English muffin.  Bottom line, if you're going to eat here, skip their overpriced menu and order one of their specials, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Great food awesome people I come here. Go there and see my awesome friend Shanon"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. Haven't been here in quite some years. Seemed clean enough. Wasn't terribly busy and was surprised to find out their old chinese menu is now a separate section called 'Fortunes'. They do have some reasonably priced specials daily and late night at both the cafe side and Fortunes side. The website does post all of the deals. Service was ok, our waiter was courteous enough but he seemed to vanish at times. Food was ok. Overall nothing spectacular but nothing horrible either. If youre in the Palms and maybe tired of their food court or near the Palms. Coming for the daily or late night specials can be worth it."}
{"text":"Decent food despite order mess ups. The martini they served was def not as strong as I am used to, but I suppose it could constitute as a decent martini. Still, they really should have used more alcohol in it.  Food ordered? Grilled cheddar cheese sandwich with fries, 2 martini's, a coke, a ginger ale, two pieces of toast, calamari and open face tuna sandwich with fries. Let me break it down for ya...  Tuna sandwich: 3/5 Grilled Cheddar Cheese: 3/5 Martini: 2/5 Calmari: 4/5 I'm not going to rate the toast.. how to you mess up on toast?!  Majority of the food was honestly less than par just like the service was. The price was decent, but I still expected better from the Palms! It took forever to get the food which prompted our asking for the bill even faster. At least I had great company with me! That always helps."}
{"text":"I came here on a mailing promo, otherwise I think I would pass, just  your typical overpriced  casino restaurant.. the food is ok, nothing to rave about, got the garlic parmesan wings, they had a layer of oil sitting in the dish,ugh. I think they should of gotten the wings  from hooters, way better. Unfortunately  I had to fill the promo of spend $20 to get $10 off. My other order was egg white frittata, which was very tasty with fruit, instead of potatoes..the service was ok, but I overheard behind me, their order was missing stuff and she try to give wrong stuff to the wrong table.  The cashier-hostess was not crazy happy at her job, no smile,  I guess lots of people hate their jobs here in vegas..."}
{"text":"Just went there this morning and I was very disappointed with the service. The waitress and busboys are not attentive to the tables, as a matter a fact a party walked out after  waiting for 15 minutes for someone to take their order, and the restaurant wasn't even busy? Management needs to step in and put their foot down and these lazy servers and busboys . Maybe Chef Ramsey needs to visit their restaurant and give them a rude awakening.    The food was mediocre, I've  had better breakfast at local mom and pop shops and this is the PALMS!?  I wouldn't visit this place ever again, there's plenty of restaurants in Vegas that deserve my hard earned money. I rather go to IHOP than visiting this overpriced place again."}
{"text":"24-hour cafes are common in Vegas, but only a few have appeal...where even celebrities, semi-celebs, and locals would dare to dine.  This place is a favorite of mine because of their friendly service, affordable \"gourmet\" food, and convenience (hence the name)...not to mention that this attractive cafe is located in a pretty popular hotel off the strip.  This time I saw Pete Rose on my right and Gavin Maloof on my left (not at the same table).  I noticed that the staff didn't treat them any different or special...and that's how it should be!  I guess it's normal for staff to see star-studded folks here.    I was bummed that they didn't have Peking Nachos, but the Hawaiian Eggs meal satisfied me with 3 large eggs, perfectly scrambled btw, 4 thick slices of spam, and rice.  I also ordered the house salad, and the size was bigger than I expected.  The Buffalo Chicken Wings, Vegetable Fried Rice, and Mongolian Beef that I've tasted here were better than average.    They have a diverse menu that includes your typical American café entrees, desserts, pizzas, BBQ, and a Chinese menu from 11 am to 11 pm.   The flat screen TVs add a nice touch to the bar area.  Formerly the Sunrise Café, this place has definitely improved in terms of look and taste."}
{"text":"Food was decent and prices were reasonable.  The service however was unfriendly and for a casino this restaurant was completely unaccommodating.   I get it, if a server is having a bad day maybe they will be a little negative- that's fine.  I wouldn't poorly rate a property based on one employees attitude.  But the policies in this restaurant just kept getting worse and worse.  We had a small child with us- we asked if they had any type of spaghetti for him.  They were firm and said, no, if you want pasta you have to order what's on the menu at full price.  So this child got an order of pasta, that was albeit delicious but could feed 30 refugees.    Secondly, I asked for my check in the group because I needed to leave.  The waitress said they don't split checks for parties of less than 8...there were 7 of us.  Yes the food is decent and prices fair- but it's Vegas, choose something else."}
{"text":"Items Selected: Buttermilk Pancakes with Bananas Foster Corn Flake French Toast Carrot Cake Chocolate Dipped Brownie  Sort of 'tucked away' despite its large footprint just off the gaming floor at The Palms it was an early morning meeting that beckoned me to 24 Seven Café and although backroom favorite \"Fortunes\" is soon to shutter I'm happy to say that while the restaurant is unlikely to win any awards for innovation all four items that were shared at our table proved not only generously portioned, but quite delicious as well.  Featuring an all-day menu save for a few items reserved only for dinner it was minutes before 6:00am that I met my dining companion in the hotel lobby and greeted by a pleasant hostess before being transferred to the change-of-shift servers we were given our choice of tables; a comfy booth with room for four ours for the following fifty minutes.  Largely unpopulated given the early hour with choices running the gamut from griddled favorites to gourmet burgers it was in a duo of the former that we invested and with the kitchen exceedingly expeditious given the dearth of additional patrons it would not be long before our breakfast arrived, a pair of Texas Toasts dredged in custard and cornflakes soon bathed in warm syrup sitting beside a four-stack of fluffy flapjacks with a sidecar of boozy bubbling bananas easily justifying the $2.50 surcharge.  Sharing plates as conversation flowed free it would not be long before both stacks of carbs were diminished and with check soon settled it was only as we reached the exit that I noticed the pastry case now full, a collection of cakes and cookies calling out to my substantial sweet tooth with my friend agreeable to further indulge - the end result a chewy yet subtle brownie half-coated by a dark chocolate standing in stark contrast to densely spiced carrot cake finding its foil in tangy cream cheese far less sweet than most."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. That's my limit on trying restaurants. This is one of the worst I've been to. The service is awful. The food is awful and the prices are high.  The only thing they have going for themselves is they are 24/7.  Can't say anything else except run and find another restaurant."}
{"text":"Yuck. Lobster Cantonese was wack. ...Lobster did not taste fresh. ...Service was okay. Line was long after a concert at the Pearl."}
{"text":"The French fries are good...the service is Terrible! It was 15 minutes before a waitress took our order. And, it wasn't even our waitress! All the while, another patron was wondering around...like a game of charades \"pouring\" something. He was up looking for his tables coffee to be refilled! I've eaten here 3 times recently, terrible service every time. Obviously, it's an ongoing problem with the their waitstaff. Terrible service always, even at the table next to me...seated 10 minutes ago and they are having to ask for the server to come take their order!"}
{"text":"As good of a Casino Diner as I've been to anywhere in Vegas. This visit I had the Veggie Skillet and Diane had Two Eggs, Bacon, Hash Browns and Toast. They were both well made and delivered quickly. I also ordered an Iced Latte with Hazelnut Syrup. It came out with the syrup on the side, so I could mix it to my liking. 24 Seven Cafe is wheelchair accessible. They also have great deals for Palms Players Club Card holders!"}
{"text":"I was way over everything at the Palms, but family was meeting us for breakfast and had already arrived on the property. I compared the reviews between here and the buffet and figured I would try and save a couple of bucks and eat here.  The server was slow, but the bus boys and drink go-getters were on the ball and were always around when needed. They have a huge menu, with a nice variety of breakfast, lunch and dinner foods. Our group ended up with a veggie panini, Belgian waffles, pancakes and something else I can't remember.  My panini was delicious and the sweet potato fries were tasty. The waffles were big and absolutely covered with fresh fruit. I didn't try the pancakes, but he didn't seemed upset and finished the whole serving. Honestly, it was one of the better experiences during our stay at the Palms, but that's not saying a lot. It was a nice breakfast though."}
{"text":"It's been a good 2 years since I was last here and that was a sober up sit down post Moon.  But DAMN there are some deals to be found here.  Fremont street prices right on West Flamingo!    $3.99 for a really large ham steak, hash browns, 2 eggs and 2 big slices of toast is a knockout deal that I will be back for.  They offer this from 10am-10pm.  My brother doesn't dig on swine so he went with the steak for $3 more and finished even quicker than I did.    We marveled at some of the new deals they have if you have a Palms players card.  Some standouts included late night specials like AYCE pancakes for $4.99 from 11pm-6am, and AYCE ribs/chicken/cole slaw/corn bread on Wednesday for $9.99.  There would be a line out the door for some of these if Binion's offered them.  You can check them all out here: http://www.palms.com/dining/las-vegas-247-cafe/  Fortunes, the Chinese restaurant, is also there and you can order from both menus.  They also have a bunch of deals.  Granted the food could be awful but I would consider saving up all day for some of these if I were a homeless bum.    http://www.palms.com/dining/las-vegas-fortunes/"}
{"text":"I came here initially for a motza ball soup which was very delicious so I decided to go back for Pizza and egg drop soup (I'm trying to cover all nationalities OK :)   The soup was a bit too salty, but the pizza was just horrible. The bottom was so soggy. Ick.   It's convenient, but careful with what you choose."}
{"text":"I think this is a good place to eat if:  1. You have late night munchies 2. You are too tired to go somewhere else 3. Everything else is closed  This cafe offers a great selection of food, late night, incase you don't want to walk or eat over at the Mc Donald's on the other side of the Palms casino. They have appetizers, salads, soups, sandwiches, pasta and burgers.   Since I wasn't feeling 100% I ordered their chicken noodle soup. It came with saltine crackers and I must say it hit the spot!! You can't do much to chicken noodle soup but being that I wasn't feeling good, it had to taste excellento do it did! The food my counter parts had, also looked delicious and I didn't hear any complaints out of them."}
{"text":"Located in the Palms Casino, 24/7 Cafe is a great place to enjoy some Belgian Waffles and a Margarita. Not your speed? How about a Bagel w/ Salmon & Cream Cheese and a Cazadores on the rocks. Still not your speed? How about watching the exceedingly rotund man next to you eat the biggest Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich you've ever seen? I thought that might win you over. When you're looking for convenient comfort food at 4am, the 24/7 Cafe will be there for you and won't judge the poor life decisions that brought you there in the first place."}
{"text":"If you are going to eat here, don't be shy.  the food is good for breakfast... They cook eggs correctly. You maybe be surprised how often restaurants get this wrong.  However, the service is almost comical.  If you are able to eat here without someone yell at the waitress then you are not paying attention.  I've been coming here for years and dealing with the horrible wait staff has really become sport."}
{"text":"Service is scanty. Menu limited. Food is okay. Servers are nice enough. We had casual dinner on our first night. The server was nice but we hardly saw him. At breakfast we waited for the server to know we were there to take our order. I just think they need a better server to customer ratio."}
{"text":"I came here very drunk, very early in the morning and was very hungry.   Got the chicken fried steak breakfast and was actually pretty impressed.   The portions were pretty big and the gravy on the CFS wasn't 1/2 bad. Hash browns were actually crispy and although I didn't care much for the trendy club assholes eating around me the staff was friendly and very accommodating to my extremely drunk ass.   Good food for the middle of the night and WAY cheaper than Palms room service (which is a goddamn fortune).   If you need food in the middle of the night and your staying at the Palms or Palms Place, look no further."}
{"text":"During a weekend staycation at Palms Place Hotel & Casino we dined at the Palms 24/7 Cafe.  Standard fare, nothing extra special however nothing really bad either.   *Make sure you sign up for a Palms players card so that you get the dining discount as listed on the menu.  Him- Prime rib dinner $11.99 w/players card $21.99 without and comes with mashed taters and veggies. My sweetie thought is was ok, nothing to brag about really but then again was not expecting it to be Fantastic.  Her- Denver Omelet w/choice of country potatoes or hashed browns and toast. Added dinner side salad with Ranch.   My pet peeve is that I like my omelets made with fresh cracked eggs, not an egg mix. I forgot to request fresh cracked eggs, my fault. Omelet did not have much flavor. :(  They have late night specials from 11pm- 6am such as All you can eat pancakes $4.99, 16oz bone in ham steak and eggs $6.99 and cheeseburger and fries basket $4.99.  They also have daily specials posted.  This Cafe was close and convenient while staying on property, is not a place we would make a special trip for.  Service was good and refills were plentiful."}
{"text":"While the cafe is open 24/7 i managed to eat their 2x in 12 hours, both sober (albeit nursing the beginning of can what only be a hangover from Vegas).  My first visit i ordered a grilled cheese. This was no ordinary grilled cheese - it was made with 3 kinds of cheeses and delicious bread. It hit the spot - not to mention their fries which were amazing. The ones i did not eat were swiped off my plate from friends.  On the way out massive cookies caught my eye. I'm not gonna lie - it may have motivated my 2nd trip.  For my next meal i ordered a asian salad to try to makeup for the fried glory i had earlier in the day. I ordered the salad to go (at this point the Vegas hangover had kicked into gear) and made sure i got the cookie as well.  Now the salad was good(its a salad - hard to mess up) but the cookie, oh that wonderful HUGE white chocolate and macadamia nut cookie. It was heaven.  The menu was large and the prices werent too bad for Vegas."}
{"text":"they have a ok special for burgers however stay away from there meatball/pasta special, its just gross.  and be prepared for 4 dollar drinks....  other than that id prob only rec this place for a late night dinner when your choices are here or mcdonalds and your out of options.  also, im a little bias in this one since i also get it for free."}
{"text":"It's about time for a new update for this place!  I came here with my boyfriend after looking at the specials they had but we were disappointed when we got there. All these rave about $3.99 ham steak and ribeye special is all gone!  There is actually still a daily special but beware that it's only from 10am- 11pm. The prices are also about a few dollars more than it used to be.  I seriously don't understand why restaurants take away what they are known for. They used to have the late night specials that do not exist anymore! No wonder there was only two tables occupied. I was clearly disappointed!    But since I was super tired and didn't want to drive elsewhere, we decided to just get what we came here for which was some sort of meat. We ordered the steak and eggs $16 , and the tomato soup $6.   The food took around 15 minutes. We don't mind waiting too much. When the food arrived, I was highly disappointed with the size of the steak. I know it say filet mignon but, I was still disappointed!  It was literally 2 inches in diameter.  Everything on the plate had good flavors but just not enough and definitely not what I expected!  Oh yelp, you have deceived me this time!   On the other hand, I give a star for the soup because it was the best tomato soup I've ever had. It is definitely worth the $6. So if you ever come here, make sure you try the tomato soup with some toast! It's delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, I lost at the tables during my most recent trip to Vegas.  It wasn't bloodshed per se, but it still wasn't fun.  Despite the fact that I've won at blackjack previously, I have come to the conclusion that I won't play any stakes higher than $5 hands again.  Further, due to the better odds, I will continue playing asia poker and pai gow on all future Vegas trips... push is fine, and winning 4.5/5 is fine, but losing sucks.  Yes I'm a competitive person.  But anyone who thinks that he/she can compete with a Vegas casino is WRONG.  The house always wins...  So I was sick of giving all of my money to the casinos, so went in search of a cheap brunch on my way out of town.  Enter Palms.  Enter... 24/7 Cafe.  Enter... breakfast all day and football on a bunch of tv's?  Enter... happiness.  So I won't bother commenting on the espresso... a automated-machine-made macchiato?  Bad move Ryman.  But the rest was decent enough.    I ordered Joe's Scramble ($9.99), which contained eggs, ground beef, spinach, onions, mushrooms, and was served with toast and hash browns.  The hash browns were fried and oily and exactly what the doctor ordered, and when mixed with the scramble made for a nice crunchy change of consistency; the scramble itself wasn't too shabby in and of itself.  Nothing spectacular, mind you, but for a reasonably-priced Vegas brunch at 2pm it was perfect.  The girl had belgian waffle ($6.99) and added fresh strawberries ($1.50)... all of which was served with an enormous plate (yes a plate!) of whipped cream and syrup.  Heart attack on a plate... but hey, it's Vegas (I find myself saying that a lot, to justify poor meals, fattening meals, loss of income, high prices, etc.).  It wasn't the best waffle that I've had, but it was sweet, tasty, and the fruit was fresh and added a nice touch... the waffle was even stamped with a little Palms logo in the center (aww how cute).  Service was friendly enough, and they changed the closest television from the Patriots game to the Broncos game at my request.  Prices were reasonable, nothing was bad, 3 stars and I would definitely go back for a reasonably-priced meal.  Oh, and the table next to us had ordered some of the Chinese food on the menu (there was a whole separate Chinese food menu... lots of asians at the Palms?), and it didn't look half-bad either."}
