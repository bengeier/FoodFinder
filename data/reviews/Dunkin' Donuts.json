{"text":"I get my 4 yr old \"chocolate meatballs\" aka munchkins every 2 weeks or so, and we've always had nothing but fast, friendly service!"}
{"text":"Pretty awful service. 22 minutes from when I walked in till I received my one donut which I ate way before my sandwich was done then received my coffee..... Completely backwards. This place is not run well but it looks more organized that frys but next time I'll get Starbucks and frys donuts"}
{"text":"Last time I was at a
Dunking Donuts was In Boston 98'. 
After the hype of National Donut Day, I took my mom and daughter to DD. We were in our PJ's and excited for the drive thru. The only problem..lack of donut menu. For someone who doesn't eat a donut but once a year, I needed a menu. The non circulating donut menu pole was no help, when we requested a menu at the window they didn't have one to offer. Long story short... that was the most difficult time ordering a donut in my pj's from a window. Staff was super friendly and of course product was great! Please supply the non-daily donut eaters a menu, to make the process easier."}
{"text":"While I like the coffee and the location I am consistently apalled by the filthiness of this Dunkin' Donuts. The floors and tables are full of crumbs, and the door and windows are always dirty. I won't even touch the door handle with my bare hands. The management should be ashamed of themselves."}
{"text":"I love the Dunkin on Green and Neil. I stop by for coffee on twice a week before an evening class. There is one lady that I always see and she is super friendly! She's gotten to recognize me from my frequent trips and she takes great care of me! 

Can't say that I have had any of the food, but coffee from their drive thru is always delicious and quick."}
{"text":"poor customer service, long wait time in line for sub par food and rude employees, this place is the worst dunkin donuts I have ever been to"}
{"text":"well, i'v visit this place lots of time. sometime (especially at night) when i got their donuts or munchkins, they are really hard... i dont know how long they've been sitting there (could even be yesterday's left over!) sometimes they are just okay, nothing too special (iv had really good donuts in dunkin donuts, so soft and warm and filled with oh so sweet jelly or cream ~  ) so my expectations are high, but most time i end up with disappointed. also, sometime i got their hot chocolate, and the cup is always only 2/3 filled?! well, i understand you dont want to fill the cup too full so it may be spilled, but only 2/3 filled? really? it's not im gonna pure milk or cream into the cup (not to mention they dont even have this option --- unlike Starbucks) so, please fill up my cup please! i promise i will be super careful not to spill my drink!"}
{"text":"Extremely slow service! They skipped over me and all I ordered was a medium black coffee. Not clean by anyone's standards. Staff doesn't seem to care."}
{"text":"The Worst D&D I've ever had. Went here for one solid week real early in the morning to see if I liked it as my go to. Children are in charge of this location, so it suffers what children will do to a business if not supervised and well managed. Big disappointment. Bad attitudes & no customer service experience. Will not be coming back. There is another coffee shop a stones throw away that is well managed and great service. GO THERE!"}
{"text":"The drive thru for food in the morning is busy.  However they are good about expediting orders to get people out quick.  The coffee is good and the tea is okay.  Make sure you say black or they will add cream and sugar."}
{"text":"Growing up on Long Island in New York, you tend to become a frequent friend of Dunkin' Donuts. What kept you coming back was the quality, freshness, and sweet deliciousness of their donuts and Munchkins. As years passed, Dunkin' Donuts has added to their menu selection, branching out into coffee, Coolattas, bagels, and even breakfast enticements--always keeping with that quality standard that keeps a friend coming back for frequent visits. 

Unfortunately, I am no longer in New York, and my recent visit to my old friend Dunkin' Donuts here in Sun City West, Arizona brought me face-to-face with a stranger. We ordered two Coolattas--French Vanilla and Hazelnut--and, a 25 count of Munchkins. We were asked to pull around to the front and park, because the person making our drinks messed them up--okay, accidents happen. However, when we finally received our drinks, they were awful, bland, and on the watered down side.

The Munchkins, those poor Munchkins. I am not even sure they were actually Munchkins. The box contained deflated miniatures of what use to be known as Munchkins. The misshapen spheres were not only sad to look at, but they were hard and stale--worn out and tired, matching their appearance. They were dry and unpleasant to eat. It made us question the quality and standards of this particular Dunkin' Donuts franchise in Sun City West."}
{"text":"Not worthy of even 1 star! they really are horrific; This is the first business I have had the worker laugh at me  on my \"face\".  Asked them what was so funny and they  pretended to not hear what I said.  I drop it and proceeded to order my simply small coffee, still puzzled.  She asked all the wrong questions, like did a want my coffee iced on a raining early morning yet left out all the basic normal questions like sugar, black etc.  Had to ask for everything single item that I wanted one by one since she obviously was not interested in serving me; I finally demanded a receipt when all was said and done, throw out the coffee I now did not trust and left; sad thing too is I think this was the manager. This was the first time for mehere  however am never going back; The starbucks in Frys is a lot better mannered/service and with none of the immaturity or unprofessionalism."}
{"text":"One of the worst places to get a donut or even a plain bagel. . Always out of stuff... I'm from the east coast n then know how to do it. The owners of the D&D, IN AZ should go back n learn how it's supposed to to run."}
{"text":"If you get there early you DO NOT get fresh doughnuts you get yesterday's doughnuts.  I've gone a few times to get some for my office and EVERY time when I get to work and open the box I say out loud \"What the hell is this crap!!\"   Really?!???  If we are going to indulge in the sugar and calories it should at least be worth it.   Go ANYWHERE  else."}
{"text":"Terrible. Pretty sure I received old donuts. I tried this location instead of the one on lake pleasant parkway and I have gotta say, atleast they're consistent in terrible donuts as a brand. Im absolutely done with dunken.."}
{"text":"The teens working here are just plain rude! I hear them cussing all the time. I came in for a promotion around mid day and they had no idea what I was talking about although it was advertised in several places in the shop. I also ordered a sundae and they did not have any kind of nuts available. No peanuts, walnuts or anything. The hot fudge was scooped by hand out of the container instead of using the pump so I'm assuming it was broke. This Dunkin needs some work and some new employees!"}
{"text":"We have been to this location twice. First visit was not to good. We never got greeted even though we were the only customers. We stood there what felt like forever until we finally got acknowledged.  We ordered a box of munchkins and most of them were hard and stale. We also ordered iced coffee that was not even mixed well at all. You could taste the granulated sugar. We already left and I didn't want to go back. 
Second visit was a little better, we actually got acknowledged when we came in. But they hardly had any donuts at all and it was even late. It was like 6pm. Not sure if we will be back. It's sad because we really like their donuts"}
{"text":"Extremely slow. Seems they're not staffed properly. The workers are pleasant however."}
{"text":"Love this location. Its very convenient and close to home. The store is usually cleaned and a smiling face is at the counter waiting to greet you and take your order. Like the outdoor sitting area. I do think that they need some additional parking as it can get crowded. Candice, the manager is really helpful and sweet as well."}
{"text":"Turned down Starbucks in order to try Dunkin Donuts this morning on my drive to work \"Big Mistake\" since I had never tried their Ice Coffee I thought I could ask for suggestions obviously, they weren't in the mood to make suggestions.

Once I get to the window person #2 was worse not even a courtesy good morning after I said good morning ... Need I say I won't be returning to this extra rude no smile no help Dunkin Donuts...

I must say DISAPPOINTED!!!"}
{"text":"I have been into this location several times and have never had a bad visit. This morning I was thrilled to see the addition of macchiatos on the menu. Mine was perfectly made, and my kiddo enjoyed his donut. 

Also, the interior of the store is still absolutely spotless. I know it's a newer store, but they seem to take good care of it."}
{"text":"Been in the customer service industry for 25 years and will never step foot in this place again. I had come in to redeem a couple of free coffees one sent for my birthday and one sent for being a part of the Dunkin Donuts perks club. Being new to the club I was not sure how to present the coupons so I pulled up my email and showed the cashier Chelsea. The birthday coupon was good for any type or size of drink ,when I ordered my drink she explained that I could not get a latte I showed her the email and it specifically said lattes hot chocolate etc. She then agreed said ok someone tried to use one earlier that didn't include lattes ok. I then showed my second free coupon for earning perks points to get my daughter a beverage. And it wouldn't pull up the barcode. She then called her manager Candice over. And she made no eye contact with me at all but just took a look at my phone and made some comment about it being from Facebook and we can't use it. Well I'm not a part of any social media so that wasn't true. Candice then just walked away and I showed Chelsea my email coupon directly from Dunkin Donuts and then Chelsea said well yeah the manager just explain that you can only get one free beverage a month. I just wish that manager could have made eye contact with me and explained that same thing to me. I had no idea and the fact that she wouldn't take the time to communicate that is completely unprofessional. I was made to feel as if I was a second class citizen trying to get a freebie. I explained nevermind on the second beverage and I went over to wait for my birthday drink. I stood there for nearly 10 minutes watching everybody come and go and get their drinks I also saw Candice eagerly helping every regular and very friendly with every other customer that came to her line and that just floored me. Why I was singled out and treated so poorly it is discouraging and baffling I will never step foot in that place again and couldn't believe how I was treated .....oh yes they forgot about me and never called out my drink so I had to ask the barista  if she could please make it for me which she did and was the only polite and kind person at the line. Tragic."}
{"text":"This place gives Dunkin Donuts a bad name.  When I walked in with my family, we weren't greeted at all.  The girl just stood behind the counter and stared at us until we ordered.  The selection was very poor and the donuts weren't fresh.  My iced coffee was nothing but sugar!!!!  I mean straight sugar!!!!!  I had sugar crystals in my mouth...I was wondering why it took her 5 seconds to make it.  I like sweets but this was to much even for me!  They need to do better."}
{"text":"I have never had bad service here, but the donut selection is the same as a local supermarket.  With that said, they do make some good specialty donuts.  I do not go here a lot, but I will continue to go when they have new flavors."}
{"text":"I always stop by when I come home from school. They are all friendly and they never get my order wrong! They are efficient and they always aim to please their customers!!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. 9:00 and they couldn't give us the donuts we wanted but they were limited. Wanted one specific donut for my dad and she couldn't even check if they had any, she told us \"were limited I don't know\" the place isn't very big walk around the corner and look. That's your job. Also messed up our order. Pretty sure one of the managers was the one behind the mic taking our order."}
{"text":"Donuts and coffee. That's what they do. Shouldn't be that difficult, right? I guess it is, because over the last several months the drive thru got a simple, small black coffee wrong. A small black coffee. No cars behind or in front of me to confuse the staff. It's so bad that I normally just go inside to get coffee to make sure they give me the correct order. The three times I used the drive thru I was in a hurry and hoped for the best. I even had the employees repeat the order back to me. I made the mistake of driving to my destination without looking in the cup, so that's on me. I LOVE Dunkin coffee. Unfortunately this is the only one nearby. So I've learned that if I don't have time to go inside to get a coffee, I'm better off not having it at all."}
{"text":"I stopped in here quick but had a good time, a fellow named DeAndre or something like that was working... before my sandwich was done we talked about his hometown neighborhood, he had some good taste in music.. there was some new flavor coffee he offered me to try and it was crazy good!  I bought a cup for the ride home. Pistachio I think it was...  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great service. Got half dozen in less than a minute. Loved it. Very great setting. You can tell it's from pgh. Parking lot outside. Psople were friendly. Nice fireplace and sofa chairs. There's a door that goes through the restaurant to the parking lot! Bathroom needs key though, very annoying. Coffee is tasty. I would go again."}
{"text":"This locations had some issues with consistent coffee... Even cold someways : / I will go out of my way for my daily coffee instead of it being bad every other cup... And a trash can in line BEFORE you pick up your hot beverages would also be helpful"}
{"text":"I had Dunkin Donuts this morning and I decided to try their new chicken biscuit. Unfortunately they were out of biscuits but they were very accommodating in their offer to substitute the biscuit for either a croissant or and English muffin. Chicken patty was a good size and very filling. All in all was a good breakfast."}
{"text":"Merry Christmas to me. Drive thru for a coffee & donut... I have a coupon for a free coffee that reads good 'Valley Wide' (for those of us in Phoenix, this should mean throughout the valley, right...?) Well, apparently not... because for the price of a $1.89 cup of coffee which they very easily could have said \"this isn't normally a coupon we take, but I'll take care of your coffee this morning anyway\" instead, they said NO.  So, Miguel, shift lead, you get a crap review for your crap service, and Dunkin, you get a crap review for not being more specific on your coupons."}
{"text":"Love other DD but this one does not have good customer service. The girl that is at the drive through especially, very condescending... If you go you'll see. I haven't been back since there seems to be no positive change. 

Also; breakfast portions very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Employees have zero sense of urgency. The staff is young which wouldn't be an issue if they had proper direction. My last few visits it has taken several minutes to be acknowledged at the cash register due to the young girl texting and not paying attention."}
{"text":"I  couldn't understand the man taking my order in drive through. The Coffee was to sweet and had to much cream. I ask for one sugar and a drop of milk."}
{"text":"If only there was a way to give less than one star. Being from NH, I've been to a whole host of Dunks, and this one is by far the worst. Driving through, the workers sound miserable as I order and are even worse when I get to the window. Drinks are often made half-assed, and frozen drinks are often not frozen. My fiance says the workers would rather screw around than serve, and they are consistently rude and bad at making drinks."}
{"text":"This is the worst Dunkin Donuts I have ever been in, and I am frankly surprised the franchise doesn't come down on them. This is especially odd as they claim to have the same owner as the Oakland DD, which has very different practices.

Most ridiculous is their practice of making their fresh donuts right before closing at night.  If you go in after 11 PM and ask nicely, they will serve you tasty fresh donuts from the back.  Go in any other time and you are basically getting yesterday's donuts.

If you like filled donuts (buttercream, custard, etc.) it is a crapshoot.  When they are in a rush they dial back the filling setting and you end up with almost no filling.  Other times they will be fine.  If you ask first, sometimes they will tell you the situation, and sometimes you get a blank stare."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time but I think Im going to try another location. Most of the staff seemed lost and my coffee is never correct anymore and also there are nats EVERYWHERE near the bathrooms."}
{"text":"Getting better! I've been in twice this week and they have a few new employees and things are looking up!"}
{"text":"My family and I just moved in yesterday to the house just down the street from this Dunkin' Donuts. I have to say this is the WORST service I have ever received. My sister and I ran through the drive thru to get donuts, coffee, and breakfast sandwiches since we don't have any food at the house. Not only did they COMPLETELY screw up our order, when my sister went in to have them fix it, it took them another 20-30 minutes just for us to get our food!!!! Evidently 10 of those minutes were spent with another customer who had been at the front of he line screaming at them because they had screwed her over too. There was only one single worker who was doing his job (unfortunately I didn't catch his name). However if it were ever possible for me to fire everyone (except for that one worker) and kick them out of a job, I would. I planned to call in later and complain but after reading that the manager doesn't seem to care either I wouldn't mind filing a complaint to corporate. Mind you, this is me seething at the service after complaining inside the store as well, and not too quietly either I might add, and yet none of the workers seemed to give it a thought. Which makes me wonder just how many complaints they have gotten, if they don't care if someone is \"bad mouthing\" them in front of them."}
{"text":"Their donuts are delicious!!!! Love that there is a Baskin-Robbins connected to it!! Got to love ice cream and donuts!! :-)"}
{"text":"The slowest service. No urgency. People walked out  of the store because of the long line and the long wait."}
{"text":"I ordered a medium iced coffee, a maple frosted donut, and a wake up wrap. After I ordered I pulled up to the window as I was the only one in line at the time. The girl at the window took my payment and gave me my coffee and donut. I then had to wait a good 5 minutes for my wake up wrap. There was a good size line behind me at this point, and the girl finally gave me my bag. I hurried to get out of the way as all the people in line had been waiting awhile now. Well when I got home and un-packed my children I realized that they gave me a sprinkle donut and not the wrap I waited forever for. So I had to pack my kids back up and drive back to the store. I got to the store went inside and told the guy at the counter what happened. He took my receipt and donut and went and talked to the people at the window. He then came back and said they were making a new one and gave me the donut back. I then waited a few minutes and then someone yelled out that my wake up wrap was ready. I grabbed my bag and left. I was never issued an apology or anything. This store lacks customer service skills and it is completely unaaceptable. I work in the customer service field and I would never allow or want my employees to act as unprofessional the ones at this location do. There is one guy with a British accent that is exceptional and all your other employees should take note. I will not be returning to this location for awhile. I would rather drive 10 more minutes and go to Starbucks where I get a better coffee and get the same customer experience then come back here. I am so disappointed as I come here on a daily basis."}
{"text":"I've always loved DD, for years and years. But this location seems to get worse and worse, mainly because of the staff. Young teens, (and I am in no way being ageist, because I myself am only in my mid-20s) who really don't seem to give a s***. From a couple of the cashiers - not dressed nicely, messy hair, messy makeup, not greeting the customer when they walk up to the register. Orders get muddled, and it's just an atmosphere of chaos. The food/drinks are always great, but it's the staff that makes me not want to go back. Shame."}
{"text":"I don't know why all the bad reviews.  I go here all the time for their cold brew coffee and I have always gotten great service and everyone is very nice, the drive-thru is easy peasy. Love their cold brew coffee!!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed with this location. I have visited three or four times and on all but one occasion the donuts I bought were hard and stale, and my order was incorrect twice. The employees are friendly and helpful but seem overworked and overwhelmed. Parking in the lot behind the store at this location is also difficult."}
{"text":"Tried it twice on two different occasions and both times the doughnuts were stale.   Maybe it depends on the tone of day.    Service was great and the store was clean."}
{"text":"Worst dunkin donuts location. No customer service at all. The guy taking my order was clearly high and the black woman in the back, notorious for screwing up drinks, once again gave me something completely different than what I ordered."}
{"text":"The donuts are stale Monday-Saturday. Sundays they are fresh. Why do they keep putting them out??! Love the $1 coffee and The egg and cheese croissants."}
{"text":"I like to stick to positive reviews, however, with this Dunkin Donuts, that will be impossible. This is the worst restaurant I've ever been to. The wait is rediculous. The people working here are idiots. They consistently screw up orders. During my first encounter,  a stupid teenage manager rolled her eyes and walked away from me when I asked for some help. She was to busy working the drive-thru and texting on her phone. They screwed up my order. I just wanted to get it fixed so I could sit back down and eat with my family. The older manager tried to smooth things out, but she seemed to be ill prepared for her job. It looked like the non-existent owner stuck her with some dumbass lazy rude kids and expected her to pull a miracle out of her butt. 

Their drive-thru is easily a 30 minute endeavor.  Today when I got to the sign, to place my order, I was told their latte machine is broken. Normally that wouldn't be an issue, however, it took me 20 minutes to get to the sign. Now I had to wait another 20 minutes to get out of the drive-thru line. A**holes! 

Later I called to ask for their store number. The young kid who answered the phone responded to my question with, \"you want my store number?\" Well, no sh*t! That's what I asked you idiot. 

I was so excited when they built the Dunkin Donuts within walking distance from my house. Now I cringe every time I drive by. If my wife sends me there to get her a coffee,  I get angry before I even arrive, knowing that something will go wrong. I'm usually a very positive person, but this store is such a freak'n mess that I need to scream. 

I only told you about two bad incidents I had. I've had more because my dumbass keeps going back. That ends today!"}
{"text":"By far the most unfortunate experiences I've had with DD have been here. Consistently my order is messed up."}
{"text":"First visit...great location with a drive thru but disappointing...not the friendliest of people. Ordered a coffee a couple of doughnuts and a shot cup of whip cream. The manager came over and said we can't give you whip cream. What! I said well you are the only location that will not allow me to pay for a cup of whip cream. I said put it in a small coffee cup then and charge me for a coffee. So for $1.89 I have a happy Saint Bernard who got his cup of whip cream."}
{"text":"No bike rack, so brought bike in.  Did not allow it and could not offer an alternative location.  Usually go in car, but no more.  As I write this I'm at Panerai having a tastey bagel sandwhich."}
{"text":"I went in to Dunkin today and Rachel helped me. I had a great experience.  She was super friendly and made me feel welcome. I enjoy coming to this location and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Always long lines and they will only have one register open no matter how long the line. Not efficient if your just going for a quick grab of a donut."}
{"text":"Blueberry coffee!  It smells so good in the car on the way to work.   Also I love that they add the milk/sugar/splenda for you, so nice.  The breakfast sandwiches are good and the hash browns are excellent.   Of course the Boston Creams are my favorite, so I wish they had a drive through so I wouldn't be tempted."}
{"text":"My go-to Dunkin.  Iced coffee's are always made consistent, croissants are freshly baked and the service is quick. On the go ordering is also made super quick...never have to wait when I pick my orders up."}
{"text":"I keep trying this place again, because it's convenient. I'm done. Their entire vibe at this D&Ds is rude. Even through the Drive-Thru, I'll give my order, and the response is, \"Okay.\" Not, \"Will that be all,\" or even a, \"That will be xx dollars. Please drive up.\" Just, \"Okay.\" 

Here is a tip to the younger generation...these kinds of jobs are disappearing, and once gone, they will never come back. In the extremely near future, every single job like a Dunkin Donuts server will be replaced by a screen and me making my own coffee. So the only thing delaying that inevitable future is how you interact with the customers. Some people WILL pay more for the nice experience. Some people do prefer to interact with humans. But not the humans that work at this D&Ds.

If you want to continue to have a job, be nice."}
{"text":"Probably the worst DD in the area.  Slow lines, constant incorrect orders, stale donuts.  Management is not doing their job here.  I would say you have a 75% chance of getting what you order here."}
{"text":"I never write reviews, in fact this is actually my first review I have ever posted before, but because I am so upset with this place I decided to let others know. 

I stop here usually about twice a week (if not more) and go through the drive through but have been inside twice and I have to say it is not the cleanest place... That is besides the point though. When I stop here, the donuts I usually try to order are not available, the employees are rude and unfriendly, and my order is frequently messed up. 

What sent me over the edge is when I stopped by tonight at around 8:20 or 8:25 p.m. (they close at 9 p.m.) to order an iced caramel latte... The guy through the drive through told me that their latte machine had already been turned off for the night.. What???? They were not closing for 35-40 minutes...? Not right. Also, every time my order is messed up, the employees act as if it is such a hassle to fix it... If they did not get it wrong the first time it wouldn't be a problem?? About 2 days ago I ordered a small and paid for/was given a medium. About 2 weeks ago I stopped to get a drink and it was messed up THREE times. 

It is very upsetting that this is the nearest DD location to my house!!!! Please get new management and new employees that actually are a TAD bit happy to be alive."}
{"text":"I ordered at drive thru the order was first taken wrong then corrected no biggy. We then received our order and I happen to check before driving off and I did not receive the right order. I ran back inside hoping to head off the gal from giving my hot sandwich order to someone else well I did interrupt her with \"hello excuse me\" she then went on to snap my head off and tell me I was rude and yelling at her\"  ok I did speak up because she gave me the wrong order last I checked that is her job I order & pay I get what I ordered. This assistant manager needs a lot of coaching or a break she got into it with me verbally saying didn't I ever have a bad day etc I did today when I went thru her drive thru I would like to commend the young lady who refunded my money, she was courteous and apologetic and I told her all the Assistant manager had to say is omg so sorry I messed up your order.  I will never be back at this location and it didn't matter because your assistant manager's last words to me were\" give here her money back and get her out of her.\" Not a problem"}
{"text":"This location routinely closes earlier than the posted 9 p.m. Don't count on getting even the most basic glazed donut after 10a.m. They are nearly always out of them, with no estimated time for their return. Not sure the donuts are even made on the premises."}
{"text":"This Dunkin is an Oasis! It's a shame that there are a few bad reviews on here. I grew up on Dunkin as a New Yorker. After moving to LA a few years ago, it's one of the few things I really miss. My wife's family lives in AZ, so Dunkin is one of the must stops during our visit. Today is my 4th return this week. My usual Iced Toasted Almond & 2 jelly donuts were great as usual and the service was excellent. They even entertained my, \"I miss Dunkin\" stories. Don't let the others here deter your next DD craving. Drop in, grab a seat & enjoy Dunkin with a friend!"}
{"text":"Got the kids doughnuts. They put the frosted long johns upside down in the box so the frosting stuck to the box. Seems like common sense that they would know not to do that but apparently not. 2 for 2 times extremely dissatisfied with this place."}
{"text":"I would give 5 star, bc everything is good price,food but i didnt like salesperson, her attitude towards me was awful she was talking with her friend and taking order from me at the same time.I didnt feel any kind of respect for customer."}
{"text":"I came and ordered a coffee, cause that's what they're known for, right? Sad to say I would prefer Starbucks over this. Maybe I should have gotten a donut instead. I tossed my drink after three sips."}
{"text":"Called today to have a cake made and a woman named Shaday was soooooo rude. Put me on hold for 10 min, and acted like I was asking her to go out of her way to place an order for a cake. Then she gave me a number for a woman named Katie, who answered her phone \"yea\" and I said \"I was given your number to place an order for a cake\" She didn't answer and then she scoffed and said \"okay\" ....lol! Just no customer service. Every time we go here its a disaster. Its just the only one in the area, so I will just drive to charlotte. I don't know who owns this store but Huntersville is growing and eventually your store will not be the only place to go, so your terrible customer service will start to make you lose business. Just gross."}
{"text":"Never going here again. They offer a free coffee when the cardnials win... Just went to redeem it I was told it's no longer valid and its only good for 24 hours. I got the offer at 6 am it's 8:30 pm... Hasn't been 24 hours. Most of the employees are stoned when you go in there and the rest are missing teeth it's gross. No thanks! I'll spend the extra money and go to Starbucks where the coffee tastes better and they hire high quality people to work there."}
{"text":"Love Dunkin Donuts but not this location! Outside patio a mess. Trash cans full. Employees not friendly at all !!!!"}
{"text":"Wrong order again and rude service. I will not be here again. After getting my order wrong 3 times and being consistently rude I will take my business elsewhere. This last time I went they put regular milk in my drink, causing me to get sick.  When I asked about a coupon I had they were extremely condescending and wouldn't let me use it. I do not recommended coming here."}
{"text":"I think it's absolutely hilarious how all the reviews on this location went from good to bad in 2013. It's not the employees, it's not the indecisive customers. It's the management. You do not want to know what goes on behind the scens here, I'll leave it at that."}
{"text":"They didn't have anything I wanted. Out of peppered bacon - their featured sandwich. No sausage. No chicken salad. I settled for a large hot chai tea - that was the size of Starbucks grande and a donut. Should have went to Starbucks. Would have cost the same and would have gotten more."}
{"text":"I have come here twice this week at about 7:30pm to get a chicken salad on an everything bagel. Once they were out of chicken salad and the 2nd time out of everything and sesame bagels. This happens quite often. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is my spot for a quick breakfast and iced coffee before going into work. The coffee can be very sweet if you have them add cream and sugar, but overall not too bad. The snack wraps are perfect when you're on the go. The only reason I can't give five stars is simply because the service is slooow. The drive thru and the sit down service are consistently delayed. Not much of a problem if you're not in a hurry, but when you're trying to get to work in the morning.....it can be an issue. Like I said, overall it's still a great place."}
{"text":"Asked for a 2 scoop sundae- they didn't have hot fudge so I said just give me 2 scoops of ice cream in a cup. Woman charges me for a sundae. I tell her I didn't buy a sundae and she argues that I ordered a sundae first and I should pay for a sundae even though they didn't have the toppings. After complaining to my wife, she says she'll reimburse the money. They can keep it - they lost my business for good."}
{"text":"This was a smaller location but the service and employees were great. I did an on-the-go order and went inside because the line was long. By the time I received my drink, everyone in the line was gone. So next time I'll just pick it up in the drive thru.

I ordered my usual Iced coffee with flavored swirls, no sugar or cream. Unfortunately, they missed the mark on this one! My drink was way too sweet, which means they either added to much swirl mix or added sugar and cream. I drank a few sips and gave it to my husband and he loved it so it wasn't completely all bad."}
{"text":"If you're looking for bad coffee & a bad experience definitely come here. I've been here three times because it's close to my house and now I'm never coming back again. It's like they don't train anybody here. A waste of time every time I try to get some coffee there. I'm so upset they couldn't make my coffee the way they are supposed too. It took the girl 3 tries today to make it drinkable... it tasted like water and milk."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Came at 2 o'clock in the morning falsely advertise that they were open 24 hours never going here again"}
{"text":"The donuts here taste stale and the employees aren't the most welcoming people. This location seems to be out of the donuts I want consistently. This place is really fast with their drive thru service and their indoor service. I enjoy getting the $1 coffee. Their breakfast items are good. I like their egg and sausage croissant. Dunkin donuts coffee is best enjoyed with cream and sugar."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the service! I wanted a dozen donuts and I got them and was out in less then 5 minutes! Great friendly staff"}
{"text":"Food and coffee are good but my order is often wrong.  Today I ordered (and paid for) a coffee and an Angus beef sandwich to go.  At first they forgot to include the sandwich.  Then, when when I got home, I discovered an egg on waffle sandwich, not the Angus beef I had ordered.  I shouldn't have to hold up the line while I open everything in my order to see if it's correct.  C'mon, man."}
{"text":"I will start off by saying \"I love Dunkin Donuts\"! Growing up in Massachusetts (the home of DD), I had a DD every 1/2 mile and have been drinking their coffee even before my teens. Excited that they have made their way to Az has made me a very happy person, just not the N. Scottsdale location. I go to DD 20 times a month, every time going to the same location which I regretted every day. I have decided to be done with that location due to the fact that I am tired of them getting my order wrong. Whether it be the drive-thru or ordering inside I have to cringe when I taste my Peach sweetened Iced Tea to make sure they didn't forget the peach or sweetener. From the top of the food chain (the GM) right down to the cashier everyone that works there seems to be absolutely worthless and a waste of wages. I also ordered a Turkey and Swiss flatbread and received a spinach and egg sandwich on a round pita, not what I ordered. I have given them chance after chance to improve but the experience seems to just get worse every single day. They have forced me to go elsewhere...not much choice which is very sad because it is right across the street from my work and extremely convenient but I will now go out of my way to get my iced tea. Even a broken clock is right twice a day, it's too bad they have made so many bad hiring decisions. They are in an area where there is zero tolerance for crappy service and screwing over customers, Starbucks is in the next complex.....America does not run on this Dunkins!"}
{"text":"This place needs more and better hired help. Been here over 30 minutes to get a combo that they argued I need to specify I wanted to come with coffee that it is supposed to come with. One  lady working orders and no one filling them. The line is out the door and they move slow as molasses. I will stick with my usual DD on Power Rd/ Rittenhouse. Way more organized and they get my daily orders right.

Oh and the more disgusting thing was the lady prepping food with the same vinyl glove she counted money and change with, wiped her gloved hands on the clothes and face, threw trash away and since I was there so long I got to see her serve donuts and stock with the same dirty glove on the whole time! Yuck"}
{"text":"The last two times I've been here, they've messed up my order, and my iced coffee is never consistent. The Boston cream hardly has any cream. The drive through is convenient if you don't mind getting the wrong order."}
{"text":"I hate leaving bad reviews darnit! I have two reasons for a 1 star review.... First off, I pulled in at 7:50 thinking I had plenty of time because online they show that they are open until 9pm but they actually close at 8pm. Secondly, when I walked in and ordered an assorted dozen on NATIONAL DONUT DAY the cashier told me they had no more donuts. I understand getting out on time and getting home to your families but just please correct the hours to all the locations in the vicinity... Anyways,  I wound up hitting Circle K 'cause when your pregnant wife has a craving you better deliver lol"}
{"text":"Dunkin' Donuts pretty much always has good coffee, no matter which one you go to. Their new ice cream inspired flavors are awesome. I rated this particular one down because of the customer service. I went in this morning to grab a cup of joe, and the employees seemed really annoyed to be helping me. Talk about a caffeine buzzkill."}
{"text":"Drive thru donut shop? Genius! Love the concept, but knocking off 1 star because the variety is a bit limited. I've gone 3 times already and they never have my favorite donut- whats a girl gotta do to get a pink frosting cake donut?"}
{"text":"I've been there a few times now just for them to tell me after I pay, they don't have what I ordered. That's really frustrating. 
Some of the staff are really friendly.. The store just doesn't have enough selection or seem to ever be in stock of a lot of food."}
{"text":"I went to the dunk in donuts at night...the donuts were hard and not fresh...the guy at the drive throgh said they make these donuts in the morning....my reply was if you make them in the morning, why are you serving them in the evening....NOT GOOD"}
{"text":"So slow over a half hour for a donut and coffee. And then rude customer service asked to use up my gift card and I got a dirty look. Ugh so many times I had problems at this location. I guess I'll be headin to circle k for my coffee instead."}
{"text":"I'm editing my original review from three stars down to one star. The coffee here has been consistent lately, consistently bitter and old tasting. I seriously think I was served last night's coffee this morning. I will go to Higley & Warner from now on if I have a taste for Dunkin donuts coffee. 

This Dunkin is just ok. Sometimes the coffee tastes bitter and the flavor is inconsistent. Sometimes it's really good and other times it's bitter. I find it really odd that they don't put all of the food in one bag. If I order a breakfast sandwich, munchkins for my daughter (5 of them), and hash browns they hand each thing to me separately in a tiny bag. Hello, I'm in the drive thru so I clearly intend on continuing onto my next destination, I don't want a  greasy hash browns bag getting the seat in my car messy. Also, they never give napkins unless you ask which is really annoying. There is a lot of room for improvement at this location!! I much prefer the Dunkin on Higley and Warner but it's much farther from my house."}
{"text":"Too expensive for what it is.  I had the ham and cheese flat this morning and it was the worst breakfast sandwich I have ever had in my whole entire life!!!  The ham was just awful and there was way too much cheese. I will certainly never go back for a breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"The third Best Coffee & Tea shop here we are I love this place so much it's very cheap and you can afford it at any cost with any budget one coffee is half price of a Starbucks coffee which is a pretty good and pretty budget-friendly if you buy one donut and a very small coffee it'll probably be 1:29 or at least 2:30 but if you want something a little bit more fancy, see go to Starbucks or starfish and coffee but this is your average beautiful tasty coffee and donut shop thank you for listening to my response if you want to tell me about how your experience was please DM me"}
{"text":"The staff at this location really ran it down. I've been to this location for over 4 years. Within the last year it's gone way down. The cashier gentleman seemed promising, until he was rolling his eyes at me taking my order and would only answer my questions with, yes or no, or even a head shake. Listen dude, y'all need to drink up some of that coffee and make FRESH doughnuts and have a smile and be friendly. My 4 yo daughter always asked for a Dunkin doughnut, now, she can't stand their doughnuts. We drive to Star doughnuts instead. Fresh doughnuts and actually great customer service."}
{"text":"Yum! Who doesn't going to DD?
Answer- nobody. For starters, they have a kick butt selection of donuts and their cake donuts are amazing- sour cream for me please. While I hate to say that the coffee out of the bag ( when purchased) is fair at best, the one they sell there is oh so good. Also, they have all these fantastic breakfast sandwich and I recently the chicken and waffles and Although it was not some compelling sandwich, it was perfect for me and hit the spot.

The service at the Bainbridge store is
Really great and there is never a wait in the line. Sometimes the timing of the food takes a bit longer than preferred,but that is secondary to how great this place is. I know there are thousands of DD in the city, but this one is worth it over some of the others I have tried."}
{"text":"Morning staff has really had a bad attitude lately, not a good start to someone's morning dealing with attitude. You can tell they dont want to be there"}
{"text":"Mother in law just went through the drive thru and tried to order 2 dozen donuts. She was only person in the drive thru, but was told it was company policy to only sell a dozen donuts to drive thru customers. She was told if she wanted more she needed to come inside. Mind you she is older and handicap, hence she was driving her van and went there specifically for the drive thru. She asked if she could come back through the drive thru and buy a second dozen. They told her that she could not. They said only once in a 24 hour period. Would love to know who set up this discriminatory policy."}
{"text":"Went to this location while house-hunting.  I walked up to the counter and ordered my usual DD faire - bacon/egg/cheese croissant.  And then I was informed that they only had fake-on.  I was a little put off, especially when I laid eyes on it -- neon pink.  Quite scary.  But I guess it's cool that people who are kosher have a spot where they know the rules are kept.  It's just not for me.  I'm going to focus on getting my tail to Pamela's to try real breakfast."}
{"text":"Stopped by this morning at 11:00am and while the place was busy, wanted to get a 1/2 dozen of donuts...didn't have but 4-6 different donuts, so canceled my order for donuts, bought two plain old fashioned instead.  They had plenty of muffins, but there weren't even any Munchkins to be had!  I was very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Picture this.  Monday 5pm.  I finished shopping at Sam's.  Dying for a cup of coffee and a donut.  Drove to the Dunkin Donuts across the way from Sam's.  Gee, nobody at the counter.  Waited for somebody to come out.  Called out, Hello.  No response.  I called out again, \"hello, hello,  you have a customer here.\"  No answer.  Took a look into the back and saw that there was a young lady taking care of the drive-thru.  Yes, they have a drive-thru.  A drive-thru for better service? for better efficiency? to handle more customers?  Hmmmmm.
What about the customer who has been in your store for 4 minutes without so much as an answer from ANYONE????  Finally, looking toward the back I see a tall, olive skinned guy open a door.  I say:  Hi, I would like to order.\"  He says, \"I'm busy right now, can you wait? \"  (kind of in a gruff manner)   I say:  OK, OK. (I really wanted that coffee).   With that he comes to the front, grabs two donuts and goes to the back without saying ONE word to me.  I wait another 2 minutes alone, in silence, in the front.  Waiting 2 minutes can seem like an eternity especially when for 7 minutes there has been no service.  I decided to leave and get my stuff elsewhere.  
It baffles me that in this economy, a store would let a customer walk out without a purchase.  So, no coffee purchase, no donut purchase, no treats for my family from Dunkin Donuts.  This particular Dunkin Donuts is located in a very active shopping area.  That is what is saving it.  I predict that with such bad service, in my case, no service, there will be declining sales or a closing of its doors.  The arrogance of the clerk, ignoring me knowing that I was there after speaking to me, and walking to the counter area without as much as a look in my direction, tells me that he has no interest in making this store a success.   Walmart is steps away and they sell donuts too--50 cents cheaper per donut than Dunkin Donuts.  Wake up Dunkin Donuts management. Wake up future customers."}
{"text":"I go back and forth about this place... The coffee is great, the breakfast sandwich items are great, the doughnuts....meh.  The quality of doughnuts is average. Good enough to eat, not good enough to crave. Does that make sense?"}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill! Seems like they can't keep staff and the morning line gets longer and longer. Can't put all the blame on the staff as the parking lot design is terrible. They started this new thing where they can't get warm food out on time and make you pull around the corner and wait. It is a 50/50 shot at getting what you actually ordered. I am going to have to find a new DD at this rate since it is so terrible."}
{"text":"I've been to this Dunkin Donuts several times to buy stuff for work. I usually order a breakfast sandwich for myself as well. The people that work the registers are always super friendly.

I did have them get my order wrong one time. I ordered 25 muchkins, 1/2 glazed, 1/2 chocolate glazed. They charged me correctly, but gave me 25 of each. Score for me!

The only reason I don't give them a 5 is that sometimes it takes a little while to get your sandwich. It seems like this is only a problem when they're super busy (they often have 10 or more car line in the drive-thru). When you go during less busy times, the service is perfectly speedy."}
{"text":"YEAH!!!!  Dunkin Donuts has finally opened in my neighborhood!  It is in the same shopping center as Walmart (not a fan)...Donuts are so yummy!  Do I really need to  write a review? Opened on June 24 (my birthday) it was the priority of the day to go and get an iced coffee and donut!  Jason the owner is super nice.  Go in and get your donut and coffee!!"}
{"text":"I have visited this location many times in my 14 years living in Arrowhead Ranch. Service has sometimes been slow but never as bad as this morning. When I got in line there was one cashier and about 6 customers. It took nearly 20 minutes for me to get through the line because the cashier was obviously new or just didn't care that he was the cause for the line growing longer by the minute. By the time had placed my order the line was halfway to the front door. Good thing I didn't want any donuts because they were nearly gone and it wasn't even 10 a.m. on a Saturday. I placed my order for 2 bacon, egg, and cheese croisannts and a iced tea. The tea was ready very quickly as expected. However, I waited nearly 30 minutes for the sandwiches which were barely lukewarm. The cheese wasn't even slightly melted. I have given up on ever giving Dunkin Donuts my business again because the quality and service have steadily gone downhill at several valley locations but this one on particular. Time for the owner to step in and see for him/herself what really goes on here."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Dunkin Donuts i've ever been to. It wasnt very busy when we went in. Ordered our food and drinks and decided to sit down. After waiting for 10 minutes and the people who came in after us got their food we decided to see what was up. Turns out they forgot about our order..."}
{"text":"What is wrong with customer service now days?  I am pretty sure it does not exist anymore, especially at this location.  Between the rude employees and your order never coming out correctly, I can not understand how this location continues to stay busy.  The only great thing about this location is the guy with the British accent!! Everything else about this location SUCKS!"}
{"text":"Nice clean place, plenty of seating, great expanded menu selection. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Visited this location today, even after reading the reviews because it was close by. The service was great. I used the drive-thru. I gave them my order and it was repeated back to me correctly. They were helpful with questions about the menu. My order was filled correctly. I was thanked and told to have a great day. I'm satisfied! D'asia is the name on my receipt"}
{"text":"I love Dunkin iced coffee and this location is the most convenient however they can never get an order right. The coffee either has more cream than requested, watered down,  the wrong flavor or the wrong size."}
{"text":"Hehe.  I love Dunkin' Donuts. Almost never have to wait inline here - great speedy service and they always have what I want ready to go."}
{"text":"Forget having them greet you like a human being. These people are the rudest bunch of a-holes on the other side of the nut house. I know the manager can get on the speaker for drive theu, but he doesn't have to be so damn rude to his customers. I ordered a plain bagel with cream cheese. He asked me a question and I didn't understand him the first time. I said, \"No, a bagel with cream cheese.\" He said \"I got that the first time, ma'am. I asked you wanted the bagel TOASTED.\" He was very loud that time and completely obnoxious. 1) Don't be condescending towards customers and 2) Put a frigging smile on your face and be happy it's Friday. And to the other employees there: don't be like your manager. Find a place that actually makes you happy to be at work.

P.S. I won't ever back. Good luck being rude to your customers."}
{"text":"I love this Dunkin and the people that work there!  I cannot get over how amazing the coffee is and how good the food is! The employees are lovely, even in the morning when I'm not to lovely lol. I am so glad this is within walking distance from my home  will visit often!"}
{"text":"I love Dunkins in general, but this location has been bad in terms of service for the past year or so. I've been in every Sunday for about a year, and my order is wrong about 3/4 of the time. My guess is the management of this specific location isn't great, because the employees seem really unhappy, too. 

That said, I like that this is a vegetarian location. It's nice to have that option at a Dunkins. The atmosphere is also pretty cozy."}
{"text":"Great service even on a Sunday morning....But not enough ( very skimpy) chocolate cream filling in the chocolate cream donuts ! 
Bagels were fresh and crunchy."}
{"text":"I've always been a Starbucks person, but if you just want a cup of coffee this has the best hands down."}
{"text":"Welcome to Scottsdale DD...

So they've popped open a new store by Walmart, and I figured I'd give them a shot.  I can't tell you the last time I went to a DD... I've always been partial to KK.

So I go driving up to the drivethrough, place is dead - dude's out sweeping the parking lot.  I pull up  to the drive through to bring in a dozen donuts to the crew here.  I say \"I need tog et a dozen donuts\"  seems simple, I'm not a quiet person, but she doesn't hear me.  I repeat the request and I am told to pull further forward toward the speaker (I'm looking right at the darned thing, but OK, I'll play).

So I repeat and the repsonse is \"1 dozen express doughnuts\".    Nope, I want to pick 'em, I don't want 3 donuts I like - and 9 that everyone hates.  So I say, no I want to pick 12 donuts, and the response is again \"1 dozen epress donuts\".  I say NO I want to pick the doughnuts.  The repsonse is that\"only epxress dozens are available at the drive through, to pick what you want you need to come inside.

Are you really serious?  OK, even if that is the policy (which is a really dumb policy) customer service might say, \"well, sir, this is our policy, but as we have no other customers within a 5 mile radius, we'll do it this time, but next time would you please come in?\".  Nope, nada.

So until KK returns (who I might point out screwed up their raspberry jelly donuts by swtiching the type of jelly - but that is for a different post), I guess I'll buy all of our donuts for sales meets and the like at Fry's or Safeway, or anywhere but DD.  DD;  What exactly are you thinking with this policy?"}
{"text":"Service was not great. 2 people working. But, no one was helping me. One was vacuuming and watching me wait for someone to help me with my order, and the other was taking care of the drive thru. So I decided to get into my car and go into the drive thru. I gave it 2 stars because the food and coffee was good but, the service was downright awful, and it seems like this is a common problem other people have had here.."}
{"text":"Awesome location!!! Very friendly and personable. My drink is always made correct, and with care. Love the employees that make my day, every time I go!!!"}
{"text":"The service was great and the treats were too! We came in at about 9:50 PM (10 minutes before closing) and the staff was very happy to help us! They served us quickly and with a smile. They even offered us some free donuts since they were about to close. I was pleasantly surprised at such great service this late at night!"}
{"text":"Cashier was rude and grabbed everyone's donuts with her filthy gloves and didn't use the disposable tissues. They gave me a stale hard apple fritter which I returned after I spit out my first bite.  Place is a joke. It's almost like they are trying to turn you away."}
{"text":"Usually just go by through the drive thru for iced coffee and occasionally some donuts. Line always moves fast and order is always correct. I'm not usually there in the early morning during rush hour so can't speak there. Always pleased."}
{"text":"Great donuts, but always a really long wait... Do you not ever use their drive-through if you were planning to be somewhere on time!"}
{"text":"Worst Dunkin ever terrible management. Slow slow slow. Done with the incompetence and terrible coffee. ( love Dunkin coffee. They just butcher it here)"}
{"text":"This Dunkin' Donuts location has horrible, uninspired service and the coffee is terrible. I have been twice, and both times, the coffee tasted old and burnt. I do not have this issue with other locations in Charlotte and across the country. I most recently ordered an iced coffee and it made my stomach hurt. I do not suggest this location."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Employees in the drive through have an attitude and are rude. If I pay cash for my order I never get a receipt."}
{"text":"I have never tried this place before...I gave it two stars only because the staff was very friendly. I had the Angus egg bagel sandwich. It was edible but the steak almost tasted and seemed like it was diced up meat just compressed and pattied together....the bagel was a garlic bagel ....and I am sure it was nothing to do with the store but there was nothing to brag about with it. Could have gotten a Sara Lee bagel from Walmart with the same quality taste. The tables they have outside had a lot of pigeon poop on them so it was a big turn off. I understand that could have been out of their control but they looked like they hadn't been cleaned in a while."}
{"text":"was in and out of the drivethrough in 2 minutes, like it should be. I used a coupon for a free drink (on my app) at checkout and it was nice and speedy - no problems at all. By the way, enroll in Dunkin Rewards if you haven't - free drinks! My drink was made correctly, attendant was friendly, and no complaints here!"}
{"text":"Everytime I go there I always get the same thing and they can never seem to make it right and just try to confuse me like I don't know what I want!! I just wanted a ice coffee with extra vanilla cream and little bit of sugar it's not rocket science !!! They can't even make that don't waste you time"}
{"text":"You guys know I love me some Dunkin Donuts Coffee.  SO the product is solid.  The service at this location....eh.   So I buy a travel mug (From this location) a few weeks back.  It overflows when you screw the lid on.  So don't fill it up so high right?  Well I explain this e-v-e-r-y-t-I-m-e I drive through....\"it overflows easily so leave room\".  So yesterday I tell the lady that and she hands me the coffee as it is spliing from the sides all over my car and me....oh and she's got tons of napkins too.  She says \"you need a new mug\".  I said, \"no the mug is fine, you need to listen and not fill it up so much..\"  She said, no you need a new mug.  Fortunately, idiots of the world don't bother me, I just move on and Yelp about them.  :)"}
{"text":"Prior to moving to Arizona I lived in Massachusetts where there is a DD's every 100 feet. My daily coffee was a medium Turbo... twice a day for around the past 7-years, with the exception of whichever holidays they were closed. When I arrived in AZ I was excited to find a DD's 5-mins from my house.

The first day I went in for whatever reason they could not get my order correct - medium Turbo, light, 2 sweet and lows. This was the SAME way I've been ordering it for 7-years. By the fourth consecutive day the manager (I think his name was Tim) noticed that I seemed to be coming in after going through the drive-thru and questioned what was wrong. I explained that for whatever reason, my Turbo was getting sugar added, or was way to dark to be considered light, or the espresso shot was completely omitted. I also explained this had been going on for 4-days. 

After around 20-consecutive days - and honestly expecting the order to be messed up - the manager once again noticed me coming inside to fix my order. This time he asked me to repeat my order - Turbo, light, 2 sweet and lows - and proceeded to explain that it was MY fault that the Turbo was being made incorrectly. He told me that I shouldn't say \"light\" I should say \"extra cream\". Really? I had no idea Dunkin Donuts of Arizona had an inability to decipher the word \"light\" as meaning just that... LIGHT! He made me my coffee and out the door I walked.... NEVER to go back again.

The next morning I discovered my new love - a Starbucks medium caramel latte, 6 pumps, breve'. 

Starbucks... a place I never stopped at because of my admiration for the fantastic service I had received for countless years even before discovering the DD's Turbo. 

Thanks to the Surprise Dunkin Donuts I'm now a Starbucks Gold Card carrying member!

I gave this DD's 2-Stars because although they lost a 30+ year Dunkin Donuts  customer, it is always clean and bright and they have a nice outdoor seating area. Unfortunately, they don't know how to make a medium Turbo, light, with 2 sweet and lows."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst Dunkins' that I have ever visited. Donuts are always stale.  Yesterday I tried to order a breakfast sandwich, only to be told there were no eggs thawed. Annoying, but fine, maybe they had a rush of people who ate all the eggs. Today, I take my kids in for breakfast, order up a few wraps....only to be told they're out of tortillas. Seriously, who is managing this place? How can you be so ill prepared day after day? Will not be going back. I'm sure they couldn't care less."}
{"text":"Just your standard Dunkin' Donuts except at this one the service is terrible. Took forever to take orders and make everything."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of donuts, but I like this place for the iced coffee! It's a tad less expensive than \"Fourbucks,\" just down the road, and way less hassle. They've added little breakfast sandwiches which are ok in a crunch. Drive through seems to never be crowded, great when in a hurry in the afternoon."}
{"text":"Today I was charged wrong and paid too much and the app never works :/ 
I wanted to switch to this coffee because it
Cost so much less but I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Hokay! When this place first opened, even getting a plain coffee was painful. Today I can say that these people finally have figured out how to successfully run a Dunkin Donuts and handle the morning rush.

Even though I only get a large coffee with cream and two splendas (pretty hard to mess up), I sincerely appreciate the girls who run the drive-thru because I haven't had to wait in line for more than 2 minutes on any occasion this week (I drive by at 8:15 ish).

Easy access off of the 101 is a plus too but the parking situation because of the drive-thru line is not happening. If you decide to go inside, park  closer to the Urgent Care."}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes for a breakfast meal.  One coughing food handler was frantically asking the manager what do we do we are slammed.  The insightful critically thinking manager immediately started apologizing to the bewildered customers and offering refunds and her sincere regards.  Not in this lifetime.  The manager replied there is nothing we can do. They all came at once.  

Please forgive all 5 of us for conspiring to meet at your establishment at precisely the same exact time on this exact date to start our world demise one unsuspecting dunkin donuts at a time.   Bwawawawa...

The food was so disgusting i threw it in the trash.  How can you seriously mess up hash browns?  

Terrible service, terrible management, terrible food.  

Will not return."}
{"text":"This location only gets a second star because they're so close to home. Up until recently, they did pretty well. But the last few months have been brutal. They've given my family the wrong sandwiches. I drove back to get the correct ones and they gave us donut holes for the inconvenience. Ordered a frozen coffee and the texture is just chunks of ice, or watery. My biggest frustration is when I order frozen coffee and I literally get frozen milk. 0 coffee in the drink. That's happened multiple times."}
{"text":"The spinach artichoke bagel is the bomb! Yum yum. The pumpkin pie doughnut was awful. It tasted nothing like pumpkin pie or anything like pumpkin at all."}
{"text":"Horrible management and very poor customer service.   They make my drink wrong every  time"}
{"text":"Good coffee, much better than Starbucks .
I had a beagle and coffee there this morning, it was very good. The employees there are ver nice too."}
{"text":"How difficult is it to confirm you are giving your customer the correct order. Shame on me for assuming that it is correct and not checking. I also had to ask for my change."}
{"text":"THE WORST DUNKIN DONUTS ON THE WEST SIDE. Every single time I go to this location they mess up my order. The last time I came here the girls messed up my drink, and I told them what was wrong and she told me otherwise. As she was remaking my drink she was giving me dirty looks through the window, as well as another employee giving me dirty looks through the window. I will not be returning, and will drive out of my way to go to a different one."}
{"text":"When we went to the drive through we were really exited to get a special kind of donut that they only sell at Dunkin' Donuts, the kind with vanilla fluff. 
When we ordered they didn't even have it! And they only had three kinds of donuts we could choose from, so we ordered that hash browns and two sandwiches. When we were done ordering they made us wait in the BACK ALLEY  for our food.
When they got to us they forgot the ketchup and the hash browns! We drove away and ate our sandwiches and they had no flavor! There are a million things we could list about the bad service at Dunkin' Donuts."}
{"text":"I went to Dunkin' donuts on Valentine's day. They were extremely busy and I waited at least 10 minutes to order. I thought I would win my new coworkers' hearts by getting them the heart-shaped donuts with cream filling. They were a hit and everyone in the office liked it!"}
{"text":"I don't usually do chains, but this Dunkin, newly minted and located on Cedar, is a nice little spot (with wifi) to sit, sip, and nip at a pastry delight. It's also close to a variety of other shops on Cedar Road and has drive thru service."}
{"text":"Good for my breakfast coffee and donuts once in awhile, I liked it because it was not too far away from my house, just a few minutes drive!"}
{"text":"Great location. Employees are super nice and how can anyone not find joy in a sea of donoughts. I particularly enjoy the apple filled donoughts and the Chocolate Donought holes"}
{"text":"I'm happy there is a dd close by.  Recently I had a craving for a bacon egg and cheese croissant and found on the website dd had just that!  Went to get one and found on the local menu board that this dd's bacon egg and cheese croissant had \"brown sugar and chipotle glazed bacon\". I thought, ok. I'll try it. 

Bad decision. Dd can keep their candied bacon. It was so sugarfied that I couldn't even finish it. Of course it would have helped if the croissant was warm. Let me rephrase. The outer edges were molten but the center was still icy. 

Got a half dozen glazed donuts which were just fine. Place was clean. Friendly staff.  

Unfortunately, the croissant experience has turned me off all their breakfast Biscuit food items. Too bad it wasn't just regular bacon like their national menu says...  too bad it was 1/2 frozen.  But. That's what it was."}
{"text":"Love my daily iced coffee with cream and sweet-n-low! Used to prefer the caramel swirl, but found it too sweet after time. Love that it's summer and the medium iced coffees are less than the small. Ugh, I'm addicted. 
     I always go through the drive through, usually on my way to work and every time I get a different person, but also every time they have been super nice. Never have I had a grump. I have also ordered munchkins, frosted donuts, as well as their frozen coffees and cool-lattas. No complaints, fresh and tasty. Never stale. 
     I've been to other locations such as the one on Litchfield/ Waddell,  Bell/ cotton lane, even the one on Lake Pleasant Parkway, and this location always makes the tastiest drinks. The lines are never long. The hours are from 5:30am-6:30pm, I assume they close early as this is inside a retirement community. I definitely prefer Dunkins over Starbucks by far. I also save $ and time. Love this location, give it it try as you will too."}
{"text":"Stopped to get coffee, donuts and a breakfast sandwich with my kids on 2/4.  I ordered two chocolate glazed donuts, but received chocolate frosted.  No biggie.  But when I walked inside and asked them to get my order right, I was met with a major attitude and sarcasm, which was highly unappreciated.  They screwed up the order, after all.  To make matters worse, there was a string....literally a string....in my breakfast sandwich!! Almost like dental floss!!! Disgusting."}
{"text":"I hate giving 1 star reviews but I have to in the instance . There was no one in line at the drive thru and literally 3 people sitting down to eat.

5 people were  in line waiting with 1 girl at the register working. The woman in front of us actually left from having to wait so long. We had to wait 20 minutes . The girl at the register was waiting on a guy who didn't actually order food, I believe , he was a vendor. Someone else working could have helped in instead of having all of us wait. 

After we were waited on, I heard girls laughing in the back so it's not like there weren't people there who could help .

I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Dunkin' Donuts, but no thank you. I came here with my child, because she had a craving for something sweet. First glance the place was neat and clean. We came in and I said hello to the cashier who failed to acknowledge my existence. The whole time I was ordering the only time he even spoke to me was to tell me the price. It was rather annoying. I ordered a tuna melt sandwich and a vanilla chai (I know strange combination). My child ordered a strawberry banana smoothie, grilled cheese sandwich, and a couple munchkins. It came up to like almost 20 dollars! Like damn should have just gone to Starbucks. Anyways, to top it off our sandwiches were terrible. The drinks were great. The munchkins were stale. :( I don't know maybe this place is only good for drinks. I might have even came back just for drinks if the service was better, but nah."}
{"text":"I called to place an order, the staff member could not have been nicer.  Even though it is a last minute order, they could not have been more helpful and were happy to fill the special order with not questions or problems!"}
{"text":"Dunkin Donuts is pretty average to me. I think they're a little bit overrated. I had never been to one before moving to Arizona so I was looking forward to trying it, but it was pretty much like every other donut store I've ever been to. Plus, by the time I got my donut, it was stale. I don't know if it was because it was mid to late morning, or if it's because they keep donuts out in the open. Either way, their donuts were average at best and their infamous iced coffee was also, average at best. I don't get the hype. 3 stars because it is literally A-OK."}
{"text":"Get my morning coffee here regularly. Usually around 0515 and there is almost never more than 1 car in front of me. So short wait times. Friendly staff"}
{"text":"Hash browns were soft, few and weren't crispy.  Egg on my Texas toast breakfast sandwich did not taste real.  I think they were POWDERED EGGS No joke...  The eggs were gross -- I just threw them out.  My husband's iced tea was, \"terrible and tasted like it was brewed with coffee.\"  They orgot I ordered a coffee and then didn't give me a stirrer so I could add my sugar to my coffee.  My husband asked for extra ham on his Bagel sandwich at the drive thru speaker,  and it didn't come with extra, even when he asked for it again at the window after realizing we weren't charged for it.  He had his card ready to pay, but they didn't take it.  The gal who was making his sandwiches looked ticked about my husband wanting extra ham on his sandwich when she handed him the bags.  Very rude...

My husband's plain bagel and cream cheese was the only good part about breakfast.  

This was a BAD experience.  Not a good start to the weekend.  Won't be coming back here.  This place needs to figure it out!"}
{"text":"What a great DD shop!!! Clean, cozy, fun, with great music, great ideas fir snacks/drinks, couches, outdoor patio, and delicious classic DD coffee!!! I love it! Im from out of town but will be back! Yummy. Way way better than the pretentious atmosphere and metallic tasting coffee at Starbucks."}
{"text":"I love dunkin donuts coffee. It's actually my favorite. So, when I found out there was going to be one close to my home I was ecstatic! I've gone a few times and each time it's always the same. Service is slow, waiting, and not very friendly staff. On my last trip in there I decided to actually go inside since I wanted to get a donut and figured going inside I could see exactly what they had left since it was in the early afternoon. So, I go in there and there are 2 people working. They were in the drive thru area. I stood there and stood there and no one even said hi, or acknowledged I was there. One of the people did look at me and saw me standing there. And my daughter and I were even talking loud, so they knew I was there. I know the drive through had 3 people come through, which is why I waited. However, at 8 minutes of standing there one of the people FINALLY acknowledged me standing there and said \"we'll be right with you\". So I waited 3 more minutes... Still no one came to help me. So I walked out. Honestly, I've visited a bunch of Dunkin Donuts and I've never had such terrible time waiting for someone to help me. I definitely won't be going back to this DD anytime soon! I will willingly drive to a  further one just to get good, friendly service and no wait."}
{"text":"If you know your menu and what you want, you will be satisfied. I've been here three times. This location is new. The ratings are accurate, if this store wants better reviews- they must step up their customer relations of delivery with a smile and overall kindness. This store lacks that warm and cozy feeling."}
{"text":"We go here pretty often and they make good drinks, there service is pretty good except the fact that they don't speak the best english."}
{"text":"I was running late for work and I had to poop very bad. I had just left my house and gotten into my car and pulled out of the driveway when it felt as though a horse had just stepped on my intestines. There had been absolutely no forewarning. I went from a needing to poop zero to ten in only a moment. But in my hurried ever-on-the-brink-of-being-fired-from-my-job mind I had to be at work on time all biological impositions be damned. I put my foot down on the gas. I California rolled through stop signs. Lights had gone from yellow to red many seconds before I went through them with horn blaring. Finally it came down to either I was pooping my seat or I was pulling over. I set my sights on the most opportune place with potential to poop and that's when I spotted Dunkin Donuts. I careened into the lot and had to brake for an elderly man who hadn't a clue that he'd just almost met his maker because my colon was demanding that I flatten him. I ran into the donut shop. The men's bathroom was occupied. Damn it! I had no choice but to use the women's john. Oh, I have taken some satisfying number twos in my day but none in recent memory that serve to rival the one I took in the women's restroom of Dunkin Donuts that fateful morning. Afterward I got a coffee. One sugar, two creams."}
{"text":"Slowest possible service imaginable.  Avoid this place and save your time and money.  Today I sat in this drive through a total of 15 minutes.  I ordered the assorted dozen so it wasn't anything crazy.  There were two cars ahead of me and each took about 5 minutes to clear the window.  The person directly in front of me got a coffee only...  When I pulled up to the window I was not greeted by anyone for 5 minutes!  There were employees doing various jobs next to the window, occasionally making eye contact, but nothing.  Even if they opened the window and told me it would be a couple minutes, that would be a good start.  I considered driving away twice, but then saw a woman beginning to put my order together.  There were 3 bags of food and an assortment of coffees being set on the counter next to the window.  I can only assume it was for the people behind me?  This location is mismanaged and extremely inefficient.  I will never go to this location or any Dunkin' Donuts in general ever again.  Sorry I cheated on you Bosa Donuts, I learned my lesson."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Dunkin Donut's so I hesitate to share my secret new location with the world. This place has a drive through and being from New York a drive through dunkin donut's is unheard off makes this place a special treat!

The service okay. In general its fast food  and fast coffee.. don't go to the drive through expecting perfection. 

I still love the coffee and it gets my mornings hoping so it's worth the trip.!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times because it is convenient to where I live. The last several times I have been here they hardly have any donuts to choose from. I love Boston creme and they have not been available. Today they did not even have glazed donuts. I will never come here again, I don't know why they are even called a donut shop when they hardly ever have any."}
{"text":"I have concerns about their food handling practices at this location.  The issue has been previously brought to their attention and yet it continues.  The issue stems around the cashiers wearing gloves while handling credit cards, cash, etc and then handling the doughnuts with the same dirty gloves."}
{"text":"Why is it so difficult to make coffee the way the customer asks for it? No one at this place understands what \"dark\" means so I try asking for very very little cream. It still comes out like they poured an entire cow into my coffee!! So today I asked for my coffee \"black\" - no cream and no sugar. Despite my request, There is cream AND sugar in my coffee!! At least it is on the darker side (yay!) but it tastes like they dumped a bowl of sugar into it. I just don't get it."}
{"text":"I wont be going back to this location. We walked in and there was an unsupervised till (with cash) sitting on the counter.  That should have told me something right there. The cashier tells us there is \"some deal for buy one get one\" on the breakfast sandwich we were asking about. Order and pay - not BOGO, 2 for $3. Huge difference. Then, we get the order and the egg wasnt even in the breakfast sandwhiches. Yep. Just bacon and cheese. See my photos. We had to go back up and get the sandwiches made again. The crew was nice and apologetic, but still this experience was a bit off all around."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Dunkin donuts in years. My husband went to get donuts Sunday morning; He called me and told me they didn't have bear claws/donuts with white cream filling, I heard him ask at least 2 people if they had a white cream filled donut and the guy there obviously didn't know what he was talking about because my husband came home with a powdered sugar Bavarian. Bavarian is not white cream; the donuts are expensive, especially since they were small and for a Sunday morning not fresh. Will NOT go there again."}
{"text":"I've been waiting months for them to put this place on yelp ! I was at the drive thru window and kept saying I wanted a Carmel frape, the manager (the one who wears all the makeup) kept saying they don't have frape's. And I understand they call it a frozen Dunkin coffee ( that I didn't know at the time) but come on, after I told her politely I really don't know what it's called, she says \"well what do you want cause your holding up my line\" and it's not her first time being so damn rude. She needs to get that stick out her ass and maybe she'll realize customers come first"}
{"text":"This dunkin no longer has non-vegetarian options. I'm all for having kosher/veg choices - but fake bacon was an unpleasant surprise."}
{"text":"I've gone to this place almost every week since it's opened about 6 or 7 months ago. It's definitely gotten a lot better since then and I would recommend is to people since their service is just as fast and friendly compared to other coffee places in the area."}
{"text":"As a resident of FreeMoreWest, I loved it when they opened this DD location! 

Pros: close to home; super friendly staff; great coffee; good mailers with coupons for free coffee

Cons: can only exit the lot in one direction; awful breakfast sandwiches that are occasionally not heated all the way through

As far as donuts go, I prefer Krispy Kreme. The DD donuts are too bready. However DD is the hands down winner for good coffee that starts your morning off with a bang!"}
{"text":"Honestly, this is probably my top favorite DD! Today is Valentine'a Day, and a little more busy than normal. But, from the moment I walked in the door, the service has been awesome! They definitely don't hate their jobs here; everyone is super friendly, and the GM has been on the floor and with customers my entire visit! Just felt like stopping by to say a nice word!"}
{"text":"We have given this location multiple chances but have been disappointed every time. Every time we go to that location we have asked for unsweetened coffee and not only has our coffee been sweetened they have asked us if we needed extra sweetener. This location needs to make customer service it's top priority. I am not sure if I will return."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy donut holes - chocolate and glazed and sprinkled, oh my!  Great service, the woman behind the counter was so nice to my little guys.  They also have breakfast sandwiches that are on the healthier side.  And a drive thru, and coffee.  How can you not love this place? I wish we had one by my house.  I would go every day....ok maybe I don't need one by my house!"}
{"text":"Why oh why would you make an ice coffee with warm coffee?  

Also, long line in the morning but it moves pretty quick. The afternoon is a different story. Soooooo slow"}
{"text":"Slowest drive thru in the world. 

Worst customer service and people who do not care. Go to another"}
{"text":"I used to love coming to this location for my morning coffee. It is kind of a weekly Sunday thing for my boyfriend and I to wake up and come by to get our morning coffee. The past few times we have gone through the drive thru, the staff seemed very irritated to help us with our order. Just kind of handed the coffee out of the window and shut the window in my face. I work in customer service and I find that so unprofessional. Maybe I'll come back in a few months and see if it has improved at all."}
{"text":"Site ran out of plain bagels, croissants,  and biscuits. Had to settle for a strange bagel which was unimpressive. No service recovery offers were made. Overall unimpressed"}
{"text":"\"Time to make the Donuts!\"  \"America runs on Dunkin!\"   I just love TV jingles.

We have been coming to this Dunkins since it first opened nearly three years ago. The family who owns the franchise works very hard and is customer friendly. The coffee is very good and it doesn't have that burnt taste like SBUX.  On most days, they give the green mermaid a real run for her money and mine. 

On the downside, the coffee sometimes can be either too strong or too weak.  I'm assuming it has to do with employees pulling the coffee from the urn too early when the Drive-Thru backs up. But otherwise, it's the same great Dunkin experience you would expect in the Midwest or New England.

Also, if you sign up for their email blasts, you will receive early notices of sales and discounts.  Recently, they had a special of two one pound bags of any of their coffees for only $12.99. Nice!"}
{"text":"Great service during the weekday, always quick and always gets my order right. Definitely great when I'm running late for work, and still have time to stop for my iced coffee, knowing it'll only be 2 minutes."}
{"text":"I am going to start this review by saying the some of the staff we have dealt with have been friendly and TRY to at least make things right. However, the quality of the food really kills this place. 

My wife and boys really love donuts and we tried to make this our Sunday morning spot. However, after consistently getting food that is either cold, undercooked, over cooked, stale, rubbery, with hair on it, or weird shades of gray, we can't do it anymore. 

We tried and tried Dunkin! You let us down. I don't want a refund. I want you to fix the system in your store that is broken. 

In all honesty, if you need a donut, go across the street to Bosa Donuts. Support a local business and actually enjoy your food. Sorry Dunkin...get your life together and maybe we will come back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff however I've noticed a few issues which make it only a 3 star review.  Coffee-wise they do a decent job and they are pretty friendly.  However, I've been coming here to study too and lately they've been blasting the music which can range from pop hits to heavy metal (all of which I'm ok with, just not pushed to 11 while I'm trying to study).

Also, they seem to lose a lot of customers, due to inattentiveness.  Many times I'll see customers enter, wait a few minutes and not get any service due to members either being on break or in the back room.

Lack of donut variety, not much to offer in terms of choices.  If they can fix the staffing, donut, and music issue this DD would be a pretty decent spot."}
{"text":"Sorry but NOT GOOD disappointed the DONUT  WAS DRY over cooked perhaps
WORKERS NEED TO BE TRAINED PROPERLY!! coffee was not good either! Needs improvement it's a DRIVE THRU it should be making money I hardly ever see cars or people :("}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good service, good food, and low prices. I have zero complaints. Keep up the good work :)"}
{"text":"The current staff lacks any customer service skills. Everything you would expect from a friendly neighborhood place, it is not. It is before 9am and they have 8 empty doughnut shelves sitting out. Have been here for the last 20 minutes and no shelf has been replenished, when clearly there is a demand. When asked why there is no variety, the reply was depending on whoever is in, that person makes a decision of what's needed. I would think there has to be a better approach to running a business."}
{"text":"As odd as it seems to give a 5-star rating to Dunkin Donuts, I have had nothing but 5 star experiences with this location. Although it's located in the heart of Sun City West, it is worth it to come in to get donuts and coffee. Just be careful for the 'clientele' at certain times of the year to be less than friendly. That's not Dunkin's fault. They are always polite, always friendly, and very helpful. The donuts are very fresh--not sure if they make onsite but they are super fresh. The coffee is excellent. Lots of great choices for every kind of coffee aficionado. My littlest guy LOVES coming to this shop and they are never without chocolate with sprinkles. :)"}
{"text":"This definitely is a busy location but drive thru has this down! Friendly and quick to have my coffee and cruellers in hand to tame my bedhead and put a smile on my face."}
{"text":"Just like the old country.....Chicago. Delicious iced caramel coffee and everything bagel. They always get it right."}
{"text":"Took the grandkids to Dunkin' Donuts after school six-year-old granddaughter wasn't feeling good when we got there she got very sick and threw up all over in front of the cash register. The young girl working at the cash register was very nice she told us not to worry about anything she had someone clean it up she said she hope my granddaughter felt better. This is called great customer service I felt comfortable I'm not embarrassed thank you to the little girl at the castle register"}
{"text":"There isn't much to say about a Dunkin' Donuts if you have been to one before - the fare is standard and the selection mostly constant across locations. This location, however, had incredibly slow service and the employees were not the friendliest. If you have time and transportation, the DD near Pitt's campus is smaller but very fast and a better experience if you are in the need."}
{"text":"I have never worked in fast food before, so I'm not sure how the whole drive thru order system works. I've never been somewhere where they are constantly screwing up the order, trying to give me food I didn't order, or drinks that I didn't order. Sure, everyone has their days, but this seems to be consistent with this location. The older lady working the drive-through window in the mornings is constantly confused as to what you have ordered. If there were a location more convenient to me, I would definitely be visiting Them"}
{"text":"First time in.  It was large in the seating area, but small behind the counter. Very limited amount of donuts.  I was a little disappointed.  The one on Hayden & Thomas has a much larger selection."}
{"text":"The few times I've been here the service is very slow. A line forms and it seems just one person is working all alone. Today was the last straw. I walked out the door after standing there. I asked the man in front of me how long he had been standing there. He laughed....too long. Orders are right, coffee is hot....but America Waits On Duncan? Not me. Service counts."}
{"text":"This Dunkin has great dark roast coffee and they make a decent bagel. 

Roomy and cozy at the same time!"}
{"text":"This Dunkin Donuts can never seem to get it togehther. After reading the other reviews I have found my visits to this location similar.

There is only ever one register open at a time and a decent sized line. So if you want one item but the person in front of you is ordering 10+ items, you will have to wait the entire time to place your order and be taken care of.

Today, a young gal (who I will leave unnamed) was cashiering. Bless her heart, she was just not having a good day. Her black makeup was smeared under her eyes, she was constantly ringing up wrong orders and one of the food preps had to keep yelling at her the whole time. 

When it was my turn, she didn't even muster a hello or how are you. She just stood there and stared at me. I placed my order although she was extremely confused. She said a few times during taking peoples orders \"this is my cue to be off and go home.\" I asked if I could get almond milk in my dink instead of regular milk and she said ok.

My drink came out and I saw it wasn't marked for almond milk so I asked the barista and she screamed at the cashier who then apologized because she forgot to mark almond milk. It wasn't really a big deal because I had time to wait for them to remake it. 

I get that everyone has bad days, but in general this Dunkin donuts just never has it together. They also forgot my hash rows and my sandwich was burnt. Butttt the baristas were pretty sweet and made sure I had everything before I left.

The snicker doodle iced espresso was really yummy though!"}
{"text":"It's 7:58 Sunday night. You are open, but there aren't any donuts left. What is the point of going to Dunkin Donuts? Major fail that you don't have any inventory. Of course it's going to be my fault when I go home with no donut for my kid."}
{"text":"Been to many Dunkin' Donuts these days. Hanging out, doing paperwork and using the computer while having some down time before the next meeting. Today, my friend had to take the car into the shop for repairs. We were like for hours. We ordered breakfast and had lunch here too.

Notice the interaction here at the Dunkin' Donuts. Lots of regulars stop by here and it's like a place for people to gather with their families and friends. Children making pit stops to get their favorite ice cream and treats. This is like the Community's Dunkin' Donuts. 

Once you on the line to place your order you are greeted which is customary at all the Dunkin' Donuts, but here there is a manager that comes out and address people by their name, so you know there are lots of regular customers here.

One customer, working on his computer spilled coffee all over the table and the staff came over to help him clean up the table and the floor too. This is a well maintained facility. The bathrooms are clean too. 

Will definitely be back here again and again."}
{"text":"The reviews left by Paul and Grace aren't authentic. Paul and Grace: this location hasn't been open for 4 years and there has never been a location at Alma School. This is the worst Dunkin Donuts ever. Even my out of town guests asked for a refund today. Waited at the counter for what seemed like an eternity because they only service the drive thru. Then the coffee was cold and they got the other person's order wrong. Where is the owner of this place? Where is a manager?"}
{"text":"Decent Dunkin Donuts on corner of busy street intersection (Shady Ave and Forbes Ave). In general, this place serves the standard fare of donuts, coffee, sandwiches, and the like. As this location is near residential neighborhoods, it does tend to be packed with older folks and parents with kids. Not sure how much the Starbucks right across the street helps with alleviating congestion or not. Would definitely not recommend this place for studying as noise level here tends to be a bit much and quite distracting in general. Would suggest going to the Starbucks across the street instead ... better environment in general, in my opinion."}
{"text":"We like a good donut every once in awhile. Dunkin Donuts is usually great...but this Surprise one blows. There is nothing worse than having a craving for a Bavarian creme donut, just to get there and find out that they do not have any. This is the norm for this Dunkin. Every time we go there they never have the Bavarian creme donut. If it is soooo popular you would think they would want to keep them in stock so they could profit off of them. Guess that is not the case with this place."}
{"text":"Got a few coffees from this location this morning. They were; fast, efficient, and the girl at the window was very nice. Would recommend to anyone in a hurry or otherwise."}
{"text":"I have to say, I'm not really understanding all the hate on this location. I think it's totally awesome that this place is Kosher, and I think it speaks well of DD as a company that they'd recognize how to best fit the neighborhood where they're placed.

Anyway, I tend to come to this spot in the later hours. The service is always quick, and they usually have what I'm looking for in stock. (Sometimes, it being an hour or two before closing, they've run out of my #1 choice of Boston Creme, which keeps this from being a 5-star.) 

Even though I come in late in the evening, the staff is always friendly, and they don't give me crap when I ask to buy one or two Munchkins (for my spoiled-as-hell dog). I can't comment on the fake-bacon sandwiches, but I can say that this is a well-designed, well-staffed location. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I work nearby so when I'm in the mood for a bagel and an iced tea, I pull into this Dunkin location, but time after time my order was wrong. Every time, I'd ask myself the same question, \"WHHHHYYYY DO YOU KEEP COMING HERE\". 

I've brought my issues to the attention of the manager who was always super friendly and you could tell he didn't stand behind his incompetent workers (my words, not his).

So I stopped coming. I've only been here 3 times in the past few months and I'm happy to say, I haven't had one single order wrong. I think 3 times in a row is enough to change my review and admit maybe they got their ducks in a row now. 

Kudos to you for making some positive changes, maybe I'll stop in for some Iced Tea (and a bagel) a little more often now."}
{"text":"For some reason, I was craving donuts/munchkins so I came here. I honestly, don't even like DD so I don't know why I came...

But I was trying to satisfy my craving and asked about the munchkins because the menu didn't make it clear that you could get any number of munchkins. The lady confirmed so I ended up getting a random number of them but what the lady should've told me is the deal I could've gotten if I actually bought one of their set numbers... Kind of annoying.

Like all DD locations... not the cleanest. I did see some people sitting in there and doing work on their laptops. So they must be doing at least something right?"}
{"text":"Every time I come here my coffee tastes great and the staff is very friendly. They are quick and they have never gotten my order wrong!"}
{"text":"This Dunkin Donuts is hit or miss.

When i run in here for just coffee, the service is usually very fast and prompt. When i run in there to order coffee and food, that usually becomes a circus. There have been times when i've waited over 20 minutes for my food. Usually it's not a problem, but when you have a business meeting that you have to attend to, it is. 

Fast food, pffft. Bring a sleeping bag."}
{"text":"I frequent this Dunkin a lot.  I run a business out of my home, so I use this location to interview potential employees.  The staff at this Dunkin aren't just friendly, they are consistently stable.  I would think in this type of industry the turn over would be pretty high, so the management must be doing something right because I see the same faces all the time.  The coffee is always fresh and hot."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and always quick service. They usually struggle to get the right milk to tea ratio in my iced chai, so I just don't order that anymore."}
{"text":"Friendliest dunkin in town!  They all know my order by heart and greet me with a smile EVERY time!  They got my business from ine of their competitors simpky by being so nice.   Get an iced tea with a turbo shot...no need for anything else to start your morning!"}
{"text":"So happy a Dunkin Donuts is finally in the area.  Great service and prices are so much better than Starbucks!"}
{"text":"It's a Dunkin Donuts. Nothing extravagant has ever been found at a Dunkin, so adjust your expectations accordingly.  They're not famous for their breakfast sandwiches or their bagels.  If you stick to coffee and donuts, you'll come away happy.

I generally pick a chocolate frosted with sprinkles or one of the cake donuts, as I'm custard donut averse. My husband is a fan of the Boston cream.  Go elsewhere for fancy espresso drinks, but their drip coffee is probably the best you'll find.

Employees have always been friendly to me here, even when it's before 6 AM. The drive-through line gets a bit long, but as long as I can get a medium coffee and a few donuts for under $5, I have no complaints."}
{"text":"I always have great service at this location, even if it's in the super early in the morning or really late at night. Today, I had ordered a sugar cookie latte (they're the bomb).. I even got offered a free donut! It made my day, just that minor hospitality that they offered, put a smile on my face. The employees are always smiling, and the drinks are always made correctly. Never once have I had a problem. :)"}
{"text":"It's 11:59am and this location literally had 3 bagel flavors left. Everything, plain, & sesame. Ok. Those are disgusting options. Then I asked for sour cream munchkins.... nope. They're out of those too. Then they tell me they have only chocolate and blueberry. Ok. Wth. Anyways... as I was typing this review eating my delicious blueberry munchkins, I realized they gave me extra munchkins for the inconvenience I'm assuming. So I'm adding stars for that. Lol. The lady at the window was very polite as well, the 2nd star is for her. The lack of variety was above their level."}
{"text":"Drive thru is always quick, lower prices than Starbucks I believe on iced coffees. Correct orders every time, no complaints from me!"}
{"text":"This is a nice dunkin donuts came inside the service is very fast. Has a modern look to it. The drive thru is a little weird as its in the back but no biggie.  Good customer service no complaints."}
{"text":"This is the fourth time I've been here since moving to this area two years ago. The first time I visited I asked for two dozen donuts but was told I couldn't order such a big order without a prior notice. Second time the line was long and several people behind the counter worrying about their hair and clothes.... Almost same third visit . I went back even after all drama hoping for better from my local donut shop but was once again disappointed. I ordered a large black tea and ice Heath latte. Got a large blk ice coffee and the cashier questioned me... I know what I ordered. My husband went to wash is hand in your washroom and it was disgusting as if it hadn't been cleaned in months. The dryer for your hands is so high that water is splashed on you as you try to dry your hands. So disappointed."}
{"text":"How do you get iced coffee wrong? I asked to have to coffee sweetened , and now I taste rock sugar that's not melted in my coffee! :( what a disappointment ."}
{"text":"If there were negative stars would be more appropriate.  We have been to this location three different times and every time they are out of donuts!  The times have been as early as 5pm to 7pm their response is that it is too late to make more.  Not sure if there will be a fourth visit......maybe for coffee."}
{"text":"I hate to dogpile another low rating here, but it's really bad. This location is a desperate cry for help. I've tried this place at least 6-8 times. I really WANT them to be here, I WANT them to succeed. 
Assuming there's an actual owner to this franchise (where are you? Why don't you care?) or maybe if it's just one in a billion corporate locations, (district manager? Anyone?) -this place is one, giant example of \"don't\".   
I've had employees be rude and shirty. Trained and snippy, or untrained & incompetently simple-minded. But the worst are the ones that are both untrained AND rude.  
I've had long waits, been overcharged (even with another employee standing beside the cashier saying \"You're overcharging her.\") had our food prepared incorrectly.  I stopped going inside because the drive thru reviews are moderately better.  I needed a couple of 25-packs of munchkins, two separate times, for church youth activities.  Both times, the product was stale. Like... Ping pong ball stale. 
I don't know. I hear there's another donut place Opening up around the way- I don't think I'll have the heart to try DD again."}
{"text":"Driving back from Whitman Az., after spending the day with friends, my little brother Adam wants to get something to drink - \"real cool\",  so I head over to my favorite place where great, big, strong, smart, Wyatt and little Abbie greet us and take our order for something \"real cool\" on this hot day.  Wyatt says, Mark, I've got just what you and your little brother will like. Abbie and Wyatt leap into action and produce two of the bestest look'in drinks with whipped creme and sprinkles we have ever seen.  It's called \"Iced cold hot chocolate\"  Oh boy is it ever good!!  Store Manager Candice has two \"Stars\" on staff - Wyatt and Abbie.  We love them and Dunk'in Donuts."}
{"text":"One things I learned about this area is the only donuts you are going to find are Dunkin  Donuts, and what ever donuts they have at the bakery section in the local super market. With that said, they have an awesome breakfast selection! My favorite is their egg whites and vegi flat bread!! Just a great taste, wife loves their hash browns! Donuts are OK, nothing like a mom and pops shop! Can not find any around here! Seems you have to go further east of here to find one? But since it's here, can not complain to much about it. It does it's job!"}
{"text":"My wife went next door to Firehouse subs, got her order and started eating before Dunkin Donuts even took my order."}
{"text":"I'm a Dunkin Donuts long timer. I don't frequent them, by any means, but my family did during my childhood.

I needed to grab something quick for my boyfriend for breakfast today, so I visited this one for the first time. I ordered him the Bacon Supreme Omelet Croissant. It was decent size and he said it was good, which is why they are getting two stars instead of one. He also ate a couple donuts, they were a little dry, but not terrible. 

The girl running the register was miserable. She did not smile, did not say thank you, and was clearly annoyed as I selected my donut types. 

I would recommend going across the street to Bosa. They have much friendlier, faster service and much tastier, fresher donuts! You would think that having such a strong competitor so close would make them step up their game and appreciate their customers."}
{"text":"Could we get any more coffee grounds in my coffee?   Coffee filters too small or just carelessness?    Nothing like a gritty cup of joe to start the day.."}
{"text":"hello everyone   I enjoy  going to this location every morning for  my sweet  fix lol when I go I sometimes  get the cashier marlia c she is always  helpful and friend  it  makes my  morning  go off right today I   got the cashier tyarra k  she was helpful and  did a wonderful job  but when I do go in there  ther is another cashier never  smiles  and  and not a great personality when I walk out   my day is not so good I never have a problem but I enjoy going there every day"}
{"text":"I only go here because my daughter takes riding lessons right next door. The donuts are usually stale so i no longer get them. Today i got hash browns. The bag was not even half full. I thought they spilled in the bag. There were 6 hash browns and none had fallen out. I dont drink coffee but my daughter does. The iced coffee is basically sugar and a little coffee. I rarely get anything here. Today i got their bitter iced tea and the hash browns. Mistake. Waste of money. I actually prefer the mc donalds next door and i hate mc donalds. The people who work here are pretty nice though the food sucks."}
{"text":"Love this place but it's much better when the donuts aren't stale. Great coffees and a drive through. Score!!"}
{"text":"Worst DD I've ever been to always employed with rude teenagers that look dumbfounded by any order. Every time I've ever came here to this location it's taken such a process to get an order. Today, however, was my final straw before completely deciding to never return. I came in this morning around 10:20 AM on 8/3/17 and wasn't greeted or let alone acknowledged at the register I waited a whole minute and then a customer came beside me and technically AFTER me and yet the two teenagers on this shift greeted this gentleman and started his order first so I walked out not giving a dime to this DD. I have a $50.00 STARBUCKS gift card I will stick to thank you very much!"}
{"text":"Knock knock.. 
Who's there... 
Donut...
Donut who...
Donut just read the reviews, eat one! 

The drive thru is a little odd being in a strip mall. However it's a donut shop up here in Surprise. By the kids school, so I can drop them off and get a quick bite to eat on my way back home."}
{"text":"The Squirrel Hill Dunkin Donuts at Shady and Forbes: Any reviews about the breakfast meats being bad are way off the mark. This is a vegan (and Kosher) DD!! They use Morningstar brand meat alternatives which are delicious. I'm not a vegan or a vegetarian. 

My go-to is two egg whites and white cheddar on a sesame seed bagel. You can't get a breakfast sandwich cheaper unless you make it at home.

Service is always pretty quick. They have a nice fireplace and there are lots of tables and booths."}
{"text":"This was a terrible experience yesterday 10-30-15 for this store. It was very disorganized from the get go with people waiting for coffee for a long time. I had to wait 7 minutes for a basic coffee then another 7 minutes for a #5 breakfast. The employees were dressed up but no smiles. The lady who looked like a ladybug was snarky and no guest service at all. I hope she wasn't a manager. It was just a really bad experience and I hope this was an anomaly and not typical or I won't ever come back for sure"}
{"text":"I recently got coffee from this location. Candice was very nice and helpful. The service was quick even though it was very busy at the time I went. Great experience overall. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Normally no complaints here, but this morning ordered donut, muffin, an bagel breakfast sandwich. After about 15 minutes told a girl behind the counter I was still waiting she said it was coming right up waited anther 10 min before a guy noticed I was still standing there asked what I was waiting for then had to ask them to make it, he even asked the girl who took my order who seemed surprised I was still there, even though she was up front an it wasn't that busy in the store. Finally got my sandwich with no apology for being forgotten or having to wait."}
{"text":"Dear Duncan Donuts,
   Can you please provide this guy a Duncan Donuts belt?!?!?! This would actually be good for your business because it would match his outfit and we would always see the DD logo (instead of his underwear and the tiny plastic packing twine he uses to semi-hold his pants mid way up his butt). Other than that no problems. The employees are semi-courteous and I get that they probably get paid minimum wage so they don't get the brightest crayons in the box and the employees would probably want to be ANYWHERE but there. I appreciate their effort. If in the area, I might stop by again for an iced coffee or some munchkins."}
{"text":"The entire staff is friendly and I tend to stop in regularly when the Cardinals win for a complimentary medium sized coffee.  I very much enjoy the speciality Double D's coffees including the vanilla swirl with cream (hold the sugar) since it's already sweet and it's wonderful either hot or iced.  Service is quick and with a smile. If you aren't happy with your drink, they will always make it right. Luckily, my coffee is always perfect. 

The only thing I would request is cleanliness of the glass windows, especially the front door. It's minor and I am not removing a star because of it. Otherwise, this place is kept clean with each visit I have had. Thank you DD and your staff.  :)"}
{"text":"Customer service here is amazing. It is a nice place for me to relax and do some school work prior to starting my clinical day!"}
{"text":"Typical DD with a drive thru.   Service was very good but a bit on the slow side.   Easy to miss when traveling eastbound on Mentor Ave as it is set back a bit from the street and on the left."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars, I would. Was chastised for ordering the same drink as my friends did by the cashier, the same cashier forgot to make my drink and was insulted that I reminded her about my drink 10 minutes later until she realized it never got made which all she said in response was, \"my bad\". Will not be returning."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience in a drive-through I have ever had. Although the customer care personnel were nice, every single order was messed up and I only had two orders. And I felt like it was extremely overpriced for what I received it. They forgot the tater tots they gave me a sweet tea opposed to green tea and my coffee was awful. How is America supposed to run on Dunkin donuts if they can't even get there the order right? I hate giving bad reviews but really this is just a terrible overrated experience for me, and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Very appreciative of this location.

I am always ordering several dozen donuts at the worst time (I think the university just started classes).    They are always patient and get my order completed quickly.

The quality of the donuts are good (compared to other Dunkin Donuts).

Awesome place to go in a pinch."}
{"text":"I go to Dunkin' Donuts more than I probably should, but I enjoy the friendly faces when I go.  The egg and cheese bagel sandwich I order is very basic, which is how I like it, and while I doubt that I'm getting a carmel latte with skim milk half the time I order it, I still go back again and again.
The major downside, besides the carmel lattes sometimes not being what they claim to be, is that there is an annoying guy who sometimes works the register.  When he does, he says things like \"love connection\" and \"that will be $500.\"  It makes me want to tear out his voice box, or yell something inappropriate like \"bring me back the nice, quiet Indian ladies, you dickhead!\""}
{"text":"Never had a problem with the friendly service or product quality with this place except the time we left our iced mocha lattes in the car for 5 minutes and our Beagle swipped the whipped cream off both our drinks with his big Beagle tongue through that little round hole in the dome lid!  We didn't quite like the product quality then... butcha can't really blame Dunkin' fer that now can ya!!

Oh, one morning this particular store was outta donuts.  No kidding.  I mean completely.  Out.  Of.  Donuts.  At.  The.  Donut.  Store.  I guess that happens every now and then... right?   I mean really, it does, right??"}
{"text":"As soon as I parked, an employee ran to the door to lock it, then the two of them pressed up against the glass to watch me leave. They were open but they just didn't want any customers, so they could get back to sitting and talking instead of working. Unless there's some other explanation, like the registers were down (which I could have been told about), I think both employees need to be talked to by management. African American women in their twenties or so."}
{"text":"Dunkin Donuts is always good and you can't go wrong with a chocolate long john, but they are hard to get here. I must have got there after a rush because there just wasn't much left to choose from. My advise is that if you are going to go, make sure you get there before everyone else does so you can get what you want."}
{"text":"Once walking in, I can see there's already a line. Great I thought, another long wait. This place was much different. The barista was taking drink orders even before you were being waited in to get the coffee made and out there. The line moved very quickly. And service was presented with a smile and cheer. Family friendly atmosphere, clean floors. The manager walks around and asks how everything is. And they're always cleaning. I have 4 stars, for my particular service. Ordered a coffee coolata and already paid. Then was told they didn't have it. So front counter people need to have more information about what's going on when waiting on ppl. Ok"}
{"text":"Dunkin donuts has great coffee and doughnuts. However, this location needs some help. I went inside for a doughnut and an iced coffee. I waited 10 minutes for my coffee.... After that I finally had to leave because I was late for work. I didn't realize it took so long to make coffee. So I am still coffee-less and out the $2 I paid for it."}
{"text":"I'm an avid DD fan but this location makes me sad. The service is always crap. They never, ever remember my straw and the sandwiches are half cold. They've screwed up my simple coffee order so frequently that I've switched to just the carrick location. Also, sorry to count this against them, but the spot on 51 is awful to get in and out of."}
{"text":"Polite, quick service inside and at drive-thru.

Have had the steak bagel several times and it is consistent. 
I always dispose of the egg as it is the same rubbery puck you get on every fast food restaurant breakfast sandwich. As another reviewer mentioned it tends toward bland, but I found it needed only a bit of salt. Another way to improve the flavor profile is to get it on a sesame or everything bagel instead of the standard plain.

The rest of the sandwich offerings are about the same - nothing special, but not bad either.

The doughnuts are doughnuts. Dunkin is the only place I've found nearby that carries a chocolate glazed donut - where the doughnut is chocolate, not the glaze. This is my favorite type of doughnut, so until someone else starts making them, I'm hooked here."}
{"text":"Food is ok, for a quick morning bite if you don't mind the long wait. Servers are usually quick ,but sometimes the customers can get a bit testy . The sausages are actually pretty good for being vegetarian, but the eggs have that commercial like taste to them . All in all , its somewhere I would go again ."}
{"text":"I have taken a break from this location for several months as the staff seemed so cold and unprofessional. The inconsistency of their product was very frustrating. 
However my friend and fellow yelper Karen O had continued to go here and said it was better so I thought I'd give it another try. Now I have been here the last 3 days with excellent consistent iced mocha swirl coffee and the best part was today they treated my dog to a treat as well through the drive-thru which I think goes above and beyond I will definitely be coming back.  I'm happy to leave a better review"}
{"text":"2nd morning here and there are cars backed up behind one car because he is laughing and flirting with the drive they lady. Can she see hi nice Audi they the cam? Again, this place is all lollygagging."}
{"text":"Although there has been just a handful of times that i was disappointed in my coffee, my biggest complaint is their service.   As I stood there for 8 minutes waiting for them to make me coffee (i was second person in line). The guy behind the register went over to the pick up counter to chat up a lady.  3 people who came after me got their coffee and food before I finally walked over and ask them whats the hold up. Come to find out, they gave it to the woman the register guy was too busy chatting up while the order line kept growing with people coming in but no one to take their orders."}
{"text":"Hellooooooo...... :echo... echo...:

Myself and three other customers were waiting in line for about ten minutes with no one behind the counter. 

Not a sign, not a shout from someone in the back. Just a counter and delicious donuts mocking me... Just out of reach. 

What a frustrating experience. I even left, went next door and came back to see that people were STILL waiting for assistance. 

I eventually gave up. No donut for me."}
{"text":"Ordered a bacon guacamole flatbread meal which comes with hash browns and coffee.  Asked for vanilla coffee and was told they were out and only had sugar free.  Paid for my meal and then was given water but not my coffee.  Before I could say anything cashier started taking the next order.  Was given my meal and still no coffee.  This is pretty much a donut shop, right?  Opened my bacon guacamole flatbread sandwich to find that there was absolutely no guacamole.  Sent it back and was given a coupon for a free coffee.  Went to dump my hash browns out on my table and out came a greasy, gooey lump of 6 hash browns.  I tried to remove one, and literally the entire glob came with it.  I showed the ghastly mass to a worker and asked for some crispy hash browns (as described on Dunkin' Donuts website).  The worker looked at the hash browns, then at me and said, \"Oh, you want them extra extra crispy. I was thinking to myself, you seriously think this poo mass is even slightly crispy, but instead, replied, fine, thinking if that's what they need to hear, whatever, as long as I can get some decently cooked hash browns.  I like Dunkin' Donuts, but I only went to this location because I was in the area.  Never again."}
{"text":"I suggest to future customers that you should not go there.  There are other options in the area or go to another Dunkin Donuts that train their employees and managers to provide great customer service, especially, when you are a franchise. 

I choose to eat at Dunkin Donuts at 7825 Mentor in Mentor, OH today.  I ordered at the drive thru.  I ordered 2 sandwiches and  2 coffees - hazelnut flavored and black.  I asked for 10 creams and 3 equals on the side.  I proceeded to the drive thru window.  Alexa gave me the coffees and 3 sugars, while I waited for my sandwiches.  I checked the coffees.  One was black and the other had  cream in it.  I informed Alexa that the coffee was not suppose to have cream in it.  She got an attitude and took the coffee and I observed her commenting to other associates.  She gave me a regular black coffee.  I informed her that I needed a black hazelnut coffee with no cream in it.  She snatched the coffee back and proceeded to roll her eyes and sigh in a rude manner.  I asked to see the manager.  

The lady, who was the alleged manager, came to the window and I explained to her that Alexa got the order wrong and when I asked her to fix it that she got an attitude.  The alleged manager with an attitude said, \"we are just trying to move our line along\".  I told her that I am the customer at the front of the line and the line shouldn't move until she addresses my customer service issue and train her rude worker to provide better service.  Alexa made the mistake and got an attitude about fixing the mistake. Alexa is a young girl with an attitude and will probably take this poor customer skill set with her the rest of her life.  The alleged manager has probably had the poor skill set her whole life. 

 I suggest future customers that you should not go there.  There are other options in the area or go to another Dunkin Donuts that train their employees and managers to provide great customer service, especially, when you are a franchise."}
{"text":"What can I say? It's cheaper than Starbucks and you can buy delicious donuts for cheap. I came in here for a small coffee and a donut. I'll becoming back for cheap breakfast.

Because at Paradise Bakery next door, it cost like $9 for a breakfast sandwich! There goes that arm and a leg."}
{"text":"About 10 years ago, I spent every fall in New England recruiting for a college in Arizona. At the time, no Dunkin' Donuts were in the Southwest, so I relished the opportunity to visit a DD and get a yummy jelly donut. Sure, the service was always so-so and the coffee was horrible, but man that donut!

Now that Phoenix has a DD every few miles, the donuts don't have such the draw. They're still delicious, though, and thankfully the coffee has gotten MUCH better with DD's recent rebranding. I typically visit the location on the SW corner of Bell & Tatum, and while the service has been less than spectacular a couple of times, they are usually busy and right on target.

So, today while out running errands, my four-year-old son saw the banner for this new DD. I had a coupon for $1 off a combo, so I thought it would be a nice break. Parking was available, a few people were inside chatting, and we started to make our selections.

Granted, it takes us 2-4 minutes to figure out what we'll get (he's four), but no one was even behind the counter. Then, when our choices were set, still no one showed up. No bell, no way to call, nothing. Then, a young man magically appeared. I placed my order, which he apparently didn't hear. When I repeated which combo I wanted, he said they didn't have grilled cheese, only the ham and cheese, and would that be okay? No, of course not; I'm vegetarian. I was ready to leave right then, but I knew my son would be disappointed (and loud about it), so I ordered his juice and donut.

Right there on top of the cash register was a sign stating that if you didn't receive your receipt with the purchase, it would be free. I was given my total (in the $3.50) range, handed over a $5 bill, got my change, and waited. No receipt. He ripped it off and placed it in a pile. 

I got my son situated and then went back up to the counter, pointed out the sign, and the cashier pulled up my receipt and gave me $3.20 back. Although I'm not positive what my total was--since I wasn't given a receipt--I'm pretty sure I was short-changed.

I like DD's jelly donuts better than any others, but I would only return to this location if I used the drive-through (since that seemed to be where 99% of the crew's attention was focused). If I'm in the area, Paradise Bakery is just next door--and their service is WAY better."}
{"text":"Decent donuts and above average coffee.  They open up earlier in the AM than Wildflower and Paradise Bakery which is a plus."}
{"text":"We stood in the front for a good 5 minutes before being acknowledged. The workers were taking care of the drive-thru line. Don't forget about the people coming in too. 

We ordered 2 iced coffees and the lady ringing us up said \"I thought for sure you'd order sandwiches that I would have to make\". Such a rude comment. And so what if we did - that's your job. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! Ordered three chocolate frosted donuts. When I was handed my donuts they all had sprinkles. I asked the employee if they had any chocolate frosted without sprinkles to which she replied, \"Huh?!?!\" and gave me a look like I greatly offended her. I repeated the question and she said, \"no\" and then shut the window. I am only sharing this because this is unfortunately not the first time I have been treated poorly by this location. Management needs to do something about the manner in which his/her employees treat their customers. I will find another DD. You should too."}
{"text":"This location is horrible! There is always a 20 minute or more wait. They continually mess up our order and the staff is so unprofessional. They are understaffed. I have literally watched one gentleman wearing gloves while making our breakfast sandwich reach into his pocket with his gloves on, pull out his cell phone, text, put his phone back in his pocket and continue making our food. So disgusting!"}
{"text":"this is the worst place in existence!!! if i could give it -5 stars i would! the workers are stupid and never wear gloves and are non responsive and always on their phones when you order! and they always mess up my order, the last three times i came here i ordered a sandwich with no egg and bagels with cream cheese, they never took off the egg and they forgot the cream cheese! i came here today and i got 4 sandwiches and they forgot one!!!! and the hash browns are always cold but burnt! and all the workers are HIGH SCHOOLERS! GET SOMEONE WHO HAS JOB EXPERIENCE FOR GODS SAKE!!  they give you someone else's order, they forget your sandwiches and give you the wrong donuts and still charge you for it and when you call or go back and tell them they DONT CARE! they give you hot unsweetened tea when you ask for iced sweet tea and when you take the tea back they give you hot sweet tea with cream and when you take it back again they give you hot unsweetened tea AGAIN! whenever there's a spill they just put napkins over it let it soak for a second then throw the napkins away and don't even bother to wipe it up! this place NEEDS to be closed!!!!!!! the eggs are rotten! one time i opened my sandwich and it smelled like dog poop and the egg looked and smelled SO BAD!!! where's the health inspector when you need them????? they have NO CLUE how to make coffee!! when they give it to you it's always wayyyy too strong or just tastes like water! they run out of donuts halfway through the day and don't bother to restock! someone PLEASE SHUT THIS PLACE DOWN OR GET SOME NEW WORKERS WHO ARENT DEPRESSING LITTLE 16 YEAR OLDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hey dunkin next time I order 2 coffees one with cream and sugar and one with 3 creams and you give me both with 3 creams and sugars. Do not I repeat do not just dump my coffee into another cup and hope I don't notice. Oh wait there won't be a next time. Do you guys wonder why Starbucks kills you?"}
{"text":"They seem to always be short staffed during the busy morning hours. I've tried coming back several times and  they seem to have the same excuses. 2nd in line and it took 15 min just to get 3 Donuts. In the future, I'll drive out of my way to bosa."}
{"text":"Always fast, friendly and efficient. Even when it's busy I don't have to wait long. Plus, they serve soy milk! I only add that in because the Dunkin near my home won't carry soy milk anymore which forces me to pay an extra 0.50 for almond milk. I've never had an issue with them and their store manager is nice too! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Love coffee and love Dunkin but this location is a bit ghetto. Not only did a car stall in the middle of the drive thru holding the line back but they seem to never make my coffee the way I expect them too. 

Purchased a chai latte like always but they didn't put any chai tea in. It's become a habit to remind them to put my turbo shot that I pay for in as well.

Staff is always nice but they need to work on remembering orders and making them like they would drink them."}
{"text":"This Dunkin' Donuts is on my way to work, and after hearing about their new Cookie Dough Collada coffee, I decided to stop by. Since then I have gone a number of times and each time is something new. Either the person at the speaker doesn't understand what I mean when I say Collada(which is what they named it, not me), or when I get the coffee, I find out that they didn't actually put any coffee in it at all. So then I started requesting the Cookie Dough Collada WITH coffee, and that's usually responded to with a rude reply. On top of all if this, today after waiting a long time in line, I get up to the window where the rude girl with a monotone hurriedly takes my card then says it'll be a few minutes. She leaves the window open and another worker whom \"forgot their was a customer there\" hops up on the counter and scoots all the way back to where his butt is almost hanging out the window. Once the girl laugh and brought his attention to the customer still waiting for her coffee, he jumped down. My coffee was then practically shoved into my hand and the windows were closed really quickly.

Now, I am not one to usually complain, in fact this is the first time I have ever even left a review at all, but this place is very poorly run and the people are all rude and not trained very well. Unless the get new management and hire nicer people, I don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"Brand new location in University Heights.  It is still working out some issues with service, but food and drinks are excellent.  Drive-through is a bit challenging - watch for customers entering the parking lot and driving across the drive through exit.  Overall good place to get drinks and breakfast fare."}
{"text":"Twice I revisited this store recently. The first time was before 12 noon and asked for a particular type of donut and was told they were out. I went back 2 weeks later and asked for the same donut and the clerk for some reason couldn't understand as if she was barely listening. After repeating myself twice and describing the donut I was handed something different. I once again told her what I wanted and she finally gave me what I asked for. It took 3 attempts for her to understand. She clearly didn't care to listen to my order. I do not plan on going back since the customer service is in horrible shape."}
{"text":"I've always like Dunkin. The 'Old Fashion' is my favorite donut. The reason that This particular place is getting a 4 star over a 3 star is because I had an issue with a thermos style cup that we bought for my wife. I had taken it back and got a bit of a runaround so I emailed corporate and was contacted by the store manager. I explained what happened to her and the next time I was in the area, the manager had a replacement thermos style cup, of a different style because the one we had was no longer available, waiting for me. While it was a bit of an inconvenience to have to go the route that I did, my issue was resolved."}
{"text":"Great Dunkin location.  They are always fast and friendly! Iced coffee and iced lattes are great! Hot coffee is too, but I order with 1/2 sugar."}
{"text":"This place is really good. Service is fast and friendly. There donuts are greasy not like the one on bell and 140th. Super fast drive thru."}
{"text":"Love this Dunkin Donuts! Isabelle is the Best! She knows EVERYONE and is always smiling. Even when they are busy, she talks to everyone and makes the line move fast. I wish they would switch from cancer causing polystyrene cups for medium and large cups to paper cups. Otherwise the food is great, the service is excellent and the employees are fantastic. We are here at least 3 times a week!"}
{"text":"I come to this DD every single morning before work. Staff is great however the last 3 times on a row my coffee was wrong...very upsetting. One more chance then I will have to change my driving route to work...sigh"}
{"text":"Wasted a $15 gift card because each time I ordered coffee it was wrong... Around 10 times getting the same easy drink order wrong. Anyways, I decided to give them another shot. The workers were unable to get a \"medium black coffee\" order correct. It was the first time I've gone back and asked them to re-make it correctly and the last time I'll be going there."}
{"text":"I was so excited about this place opening and went there and they couldn't understand that I wanted my chai tea iced . Gave me the chai tea warm and a cup of ice . Any other place I go I can get it large and with ice . The staff isn't friendly either . They seem as if they don't want to be there and I'm bugging them coming in and ordering what I want . I will not be going back to this location . Very sad since it's right by my house . :("}
{"text":"Worst location ever. Coffee seems watered down and service is a joke. When the young teenager with attitude told me my total I said that's wrong i only order one americano her remark was um actually you ordered two ... closed the window on me and proceeded to give me attitude I will be going to corporate on this as his location needs a fixing up."}
{"text":"The new manager of this location is THE BEST. He runs the register and does his share of work whilst providing a smile. My coffee wasn't ready by the time my food was so he had the staff upsize my drink on the house. I've had several iffy experiences here since it opened, but it's turned around!"}
{"text":"This place has turned into a joke. The people that work there are really nice. However, if you are the manager or owner you should be embarrassed! 

Friday May 12th 8:45 pm - no donuts and no munchkins! Ok it's late on a Friday, I get it. 

Sunday May 14 ( Mothers Day) 11:30am - No Munchkins, No muffins, and NO DONUTS!!!! Seriously? You're Dunkin' Donuts! 

I'll drive down the road to the next D&D or Starbucks! Refuse to give them another chance. #DunkinDounts"}
{"text":"I love Dunkin but keep driving until you hit the next franchise. Poor customer service. Then I twisted my foot near the counter with the straws because the floor drain was missing a cover. I asked the employee if he knew the drain was open and his response was- \"it's fine.\" Nice."}
{"text":"This Dunkin Donuts is the best!! Cheap coffee that tastes good!! Gary is especially the best. He's always so friendly and helpful and cheerful. The only thing is my coffee is never stirred at Dunkin Donuts, so I have to stir it myself. But that's okay I guess because the coffee is so cheap and so good!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for the last 4 years always get good customer service and my ice coffee is always fire that's gets my day started..!!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could not give any stars!   With this being a DONUT place the selection sure does suck!   Very disappointing!  I'll take my business elsewhere, like star dounuts down the road."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Dunkin' Donuts in a year today I had to get on the 303 so I figured I'll give them another shot. Not only did the drive-through staff act like I was bugging them with my order when I got to the window they repeated it back to me three times I confirmed with a smile they did not give me the chocolate milk I paid for and she kept rolling her eyes and huffing and puffing. This is why I drive out of my way to go to Dutch brothers I want to be treated like a customer. 

If you guys wanna stay in the coffee game hire sweet people !"}
{"text":"Stopped in to this location this morning about 0830. Found the store itself to be really dirty and messy. Trash on the floor and tables, spilled milk on a table. The employee and the register wasn't very friendly and kept turning around to talk to the people behind her while I was trying to order, then had me repeat my order every time. Not a bad experience really, but not that great either. Overall not a very friendly or welcoming atmosphere. Went to this location because it was on my way to an appointment, but I think I'll stick with my usual location on Thunderbird."}
{"text":"Ok so the food is fine, it's fast food breakfast food, not much to be expected. Every time I've gone the service has been very fast, I've never had to wait long for anything. BUT.... they are always out of something, and I don't go at weird times, the latest I've ever gone has been 11am, so I feel like they need to step it up with keeping things stocked. There has not been one time I've gone where they have had plain bagels, which I don't understand because that's the most common bagel, how do you run out? They have also been out of croissants, numerous other bagel flavors, and donuts. Seriously WTF!?? Maybe I just have bad luck with the days i choose to go, but I'm definitely going to start eating a different location, because it's absolutely ridiculous that they would be out of these things so early."}
{"text":"The customer service from most of the employees is outstanding! They always remember my order and are super sweet. The only reason I'm not rating 5 stars is for one employee in particular. The short blonde. She gives off attitude and is very snobby. Not very good work ethic if you ask me!"}
{"text":"Visited this place today after months of not going to this specific location, and of course my drink was messed up. Still the same crappy place, don't know why it's so hard to make a good cup of coffee the way the customer asks for it?"}
{"text":"The doughnuts are good, when they have them...but do not go through the drive through... their drive thru is slow, you get the wrong coffee order (many times), or they take your order...you wait the 15 minutes in line...and then they tell you that they don't have something.  I have been burned from this place too many times... and i have heard from friends that others in the work day mornings have had similar experiences.  If it continues, this place will be closed within a couple years."}
{"text":"Absolute junk! Don't waste your time or money here! Zero customer service, horrible donuts, employees chatting and telling each other stories and giving attitude to the customer! Did I mention they serve junk? Zero stars"}
{"text":"worst customer service. all the time. drive thru employees have been rude every single time we come."}
{"text":"First off it was raining and three people were waiting out side for them to open  it was 4:55 am they didn't open till five which is their time to open but have some  courtesy. 3-5 minutes is not jeopardizing security even my bank opens 5 min early and stays open 5 late. Then I tried to order the same thing I get at every dunkin ( ham and cheese croissant) but they only have Kosher vegan food. That's right not real meat. I'm not against it everyone should be able to eat , yep EVERY ONE including myself. They were very smug about everything and dismissed me when I said I eat meat and I still had a beverage but put it back. I would've tried it on another day but I was starving and didn't want to risk it. Still think they should be required to serve the same things as all the rest. Dunkin allows this ? Guess it's sheets and wawa for now on."}
{"text":"The only kosher Dunkin Doughnuts. This is a really cool place. Actually it has become a regular hangout for me and a few friends. They have lots of comfy seats and the atmosphere is very open. A perfect place to study or socialize. 

p.s. One barista gave me the \"happy hour\" price for my iced pumpkin spice coffee 15 minutes early! So that was pretty cool."}
{"text":"I would give one star but I'm going to be nice and give 2.
So I'm from new Jersey (I feel like I start a lot of my reviews this way).
I grew up on Dunkin and I've never had an issue at any Dunkin in my life expect for this one.. not sure if the girls need better training or what is going on?
So first off why do they have like 5 donuts to pick from? No bagels no muffin? It was 9am when I came in..so I got a French vanilla light and sweet with a strawberry frosted donut.
Now here is where things get bad.. now I said light and sweet. And the lovely girl behind the counter said \"skim milk with one sugar?\" So I replied back with no I said \"light and sweet\" not that hard... light and sweet. U can go to any Dunkin and they know what u mean. So she said \"I'm lost I don't understand.\" She kept saying so one sugar .. wtf! Light and sweet lol... anyway got my drink and my donut and left....
This store needs better training. Teach ur staff the ways of Dunkin =)"}
{"text":"The associates at this store are not the most attentive. I was waiting out front for a few minutes before I decided to yell back that I was out front. Had I not come in for someone else, I would have left without purchasing anything.

At least my persistence paid off; I was able to purchase two donuts for my friend and I. If only those donuts had been fresher..."}
{"text":"I love dunkin donuts. However, i went to this one and was extremely disappointed. I had seen the poor reviews but i just thought people were frustrated with the \"slow service.\" I wasnt worried about that because i wasnt going during rush times. Anyways, the people were not very pleasant. My iced coffee is so so. I ordered the veggie egg flatbread. It was so small and there was barely anything inside. I almost turned around and asked them if this is seriously what i paid for. I ate it and im still hungry because it was minature. not to mention the flatbread was like crispy and was had a very bizarre texture for a flatbread. Ive attached photos. Would definitely not return to this one. Ill drive the extra few miles to go to elsewhere or at least another location."}
{"text":"This location sucks. The employees are always rude and they're ALWAYS out of the donuts I want. I won't buy lattes here anymore because whenever I do, it's no exaggeration, only half a cup full. 
I'll be looking for a new place to spend my money."}
{"text":"I love Dunkins. Just not this one. The workers here do not care. I have been served cold coffee multiple times. Today I was in drive thru behind one car and they handed her a box of donuts. She stayed at window, 8 minutes later they hand her change and she rolls away. I pulled up and they have three bags waiting. I paid and they told me that they forgot to make my order and I had to wait. At this point o have been here 10 minutes and was the second car in line and now there are 5 behind me. 

I asked for my money back and they took 2 more minutes to give it to me. And my order still wasn't ready. 

Just avoid this place. I could go on but it's not worth it.

You have been warned."}
{"text":"This by far is one of the worst dunkn have been to. After the last experience had coffee not tasting right and being cold and rude service. Tried a couple mornings and at 5:10 still not open when open at 5:00. Or if you do go in no since of being quick when only one in store and no they are all worried about drive thru. Don't even worry about doing the survey even after saying someone will contact you and don't. Tried one last time wanted to get some donuts 5people behind counter  and no one working 3 people walked out besides myself clearly America doesn't run on this dunkn. Maybe this review will make it to corporate."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Donuts are always stale. Coffee always tastes burned. Staff is rude. I never have a good experience here. Worst dunkin donuts I have ever been to."}
{"text":"Best dunkin. They make the best coffee. I will not go to any other dunkin. They know how to make my coffee just right. Miranda and Taylor are awesome employees!  They always take wonderful care of me."}
{"text":"I have made a couple visits over the years (I don't live in Champaign). Located along a major thoroughfare for the city and near campustown. The donuts are pretty good. Quick service. However, not all the donuts are in stock at a given time. I was just there and didn't even see glazed yeast donuts (the classic).- just glazed cake and the glazed minis. I appreciate having someplace to grab a snack with early morning Black Friday shopping."}
{"text":"Great service and solid donuts. Iced coffee is also a must try. This Dunkin' is head and shoulders over the Solon location."}
{"text":"I was SO excited when this DD moved into my neighborhood. I drove by it every day and I was there the second they opened for their Grand Opening. On my first time there, I was very pleasantly greeted by their staff
who asked if I was a regular. It must've been the way I ordered my coffee. I have continued to go there every week since they have opened, but I know that quite a few things have changed and it's really bothering me. 

This review is strictly on the customer service that I am beginning to really dislike. Not one person looks like they are happy to work here, and they make me feel like I am completely inconveniencing them. I thought for sure from the very first day that this was going to be a great DD to go to. Everyone is so personable at the other two locations I visit, and I guess I thought this one would be the same. 

If this sour attitude and unhappiness continues, I will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I visit this Dunkin' Donuts every morning. They always get my drink correct and are very consistent with the way it tastes. The customer service is good, they know me by name and I have never had any problems at this location. My favorite employee is Kable. She rocks."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for a DD.  Service and coffee is still top notch.  Clean and family friendly.

Most importantly, if you're on the go, they have a couple of speedster checkout cashiers.  Bonus, their to-go lids are probably the best designed of all coffee shops."}
{"text":"We came here to purchase mini donuts and arranged by ourselves as flower bouquet for my mother in law 91st birthday gift since she loves donuts.

The manager was super kind, he helped our needs and he didn't event charge us, it's all free!  It's super awesome right???

Thank you a bunch Dunkin' Donuts!"}
{"text":"I'm so grateful to have a DD location relatively near by with a drive thru!  This is my favorite coffee of all time...it gets me up in the morning:) They have great deals if you sign up for their rewards card!  Free medium hot or iced coffee on Mondays after a Cardinals win (I assume other teams/locations offer an equivalent deal). They also have discounts on kcups (2/$14.99), free coffee every 300pts and all kinds of specials to get extra points (try new menu item, come in 3x's in the next 2 weeks, etc).  I've almost always got multiple free coffees on my account. I even have the app on my phone, so it reloads every Monday, so I get rewards offers, track points and pay right from my phone at the drive in window (they scan it in my hand). I've had an occasional mishap on an order, but they've always been gracious about fixing it.  
Food serves its purpose, not the homemade donuts of a non-chain, and the sandwiches are what you'd expect. The workers at window are polite and efficient.

UPDATE:
They've been sliding downhill. Fast. This month I've gone multiple times when they didn't have large or xl cups! Really? Lots of items unavailable, plus the food is NOT good, and problems/mistakes are WAY too frequent to be acceptable. I'll continue the drive thru for my coffee occasionally ONLY b/c of my love of DD coffee & the convenience, but they won't get any additional business from me until they get their act together.  For the gas I use getting here, I will take my business to a closer location...management needs to step it up!"}
{"text":"Always been a fan of Dunkin Donut's and totally stoked that they have one near me to stop at on my way to work, which is totally convenient w/ a drive thru. 

I really don't eat donuts a lot these days but if I'm ever looking to cure a sweet tooth they always have them fresh. The iced coffee is perfection and if you aren't the coffee fan they have these blended drinks called 'Cool latta's' - I've only had the orange flavored one but sooo good!

Enjoy- thank me later"}
{"text":"Happy Anniversary Week DD! (50 cent Medium Coffees, iced or hot, until the 21st) Why was I not informed of this earlier?! I was and am all over this deal right now, and so were the 10 people I saw with medium coffees walking out of the shop this morning. It was a mad house I say, A MAD HOUSE!!!!

Before the revamping of every single DD on the planet, I remember this place as it once was...Proud, mystical, and always very crowded. About a decade or more ago, this shop was owned by a man from Philly or New York or New Jersey, his name escapes me, but he was a very friendly man. My Pops and him use to talk about the East Coast every single time we'd go in, while I munched on a Vanilla Cream. There was always an abundance of the right kind of donuts, and when I say the right kind, I'm talking about Vanilla Cream, all the other donuts can take a flying leap! Well, thinking harder about it the owner was probably from New Jersey... I'm pretty sure I heard him say water like someone from New Jersey. Side story here, I have heard my Pop say 'water' once in my entire life, but he insists on pronouncing it 'wudder', I'm not saying there is a right or wrong way to say the word but universally I think I have it correct. Anywho...

Obviously pink and orange-itized to the point of hurting my eyes some mornings, this DD offers the same quality in food and beverage as it did in its earlier years.They have healthier eating options and a variety. Not just your typical milk, donuts, and coffee anymore folks. Half of the racks are muffins and bagels, and you can order flat bread sandwiches now (Reluctant at first, I have found the Veg version to be ultra delicious). Lots of places to sit, indoors and outdoors, flat screen televisions with the news, sports or DD advertisements, and your local paper(s).

Even though the service isn't as personal as it use to be, you are still greeted with a hearty smile and given the coffee and/or donuts you came for. I guess that's all that matters with you young people nowadays. You just don't understand, that sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name, and they're always glad you came..."}
{"text":"This DD is sadly very disappointing. I've tried to give them 3 different tries over about a years time frame... One time I experienced the manager and the employee arguing at the register as the employee walked away in tears. Another time it took them 25 minutes to give me a cold breakfast biscuit and barely warm coffee.  They seem to be always rude and disorganized.  I think I'm done coming here.  That's unfortunate, because I like their black coffee with sugar and creamer.  
Customer service goes a long way. They could really thrive if they either, A: had a better team. Or B: worked on becoming a better team together."}
{"text":"The workers here obviously don't care about their jobs and they make terrible coffee. There was so much flavoring in my ice coffee that it was literally making me gag and I had to throw it out. I would have asked for my money back if I wasn't late for something and already several blocks away. I'll never go back here again."}
{"text":"I love the doughnuts here. One tip though, don't go at night. It's a popular location and they tend to have very few choices as evening wears on."}
{"text":"These guys are pretty quick and they usually get our order right in the drive thru. Sometimes they don't hear me correctly and but they seem to be very polite. When you go inside the shop is usual very clean and never very packed. This is the Dunkin we go to now since it's so close to our home."}
{"text":"The First time I was in this store . It's a new store in the area . By 11:45 am there were no donuts left except for a tray of vanilla cream . They had some donut holes but when we asked where were all the donuts? They just laughed .. as if the store was closing any minute or something . There were about 7 young guys working but no one was helpful at all . Sad"}
{"text":"Cheap and GOOD coffee! It's a nice switch-up from Starbucks for me. Try the K-cups - that way you can bust out some DD-grade from your home-based Keurig.

Donuts are boss too. Try the non-PC named \"Munchkins\" - that way you can pop the whole sucker in your mouth at once! Red Velvet... mmmmm...

Plus a drive-thru? I thought it was rather sick that AZ had drive-thru liquor and cig places, but drive-thru for donuts?!? Talk about being a lazy-ass fatty! Okay, I've done it before 1x (shhhh). But in my defense, I was in a hurry AND it was hot outside. ;)"}
{"text":"The service is fast and friendly, both inside and at the drive-through.  They seem to keep up with the morning rush well!  Decent regular or iced coffee (can't comment on the specialty drinks though.)  Personally, I think Sunrise donuts are better, but Dunkin' is on the right side of the street for me morning commute!"}
{"text":"Pretty good coffee , super nice staff. The donuts are not as good as I remember as a kid ,but I still love them. It's open 24 /7 but only have donuts till 12 am. I remember when I was young they made them right in house. They would probably get more business late night if they had fresh donuts 24/7. I still love the place . Just a tip ,plus my husband goes,after the gym and is always mad when they don't have donuts."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location since they opened.  First of all,  I love the staff!  So friendly and helpful!   The manager is awesome!   What's unique about this location is they are not afraid to try new things!   I love their \"manager special \" munchkins!   They've made apple cinnamon munchkins,  strawberries and cream and snickerdoodle!   Every week there's a new flavor!   I've never seen that anywhere else!  

I love how the manager interacts with the customers!   I go there so much they make my drink prefect! I prefer to go inside vs the drive thru because they're just that nice and I like talking to them!   

If your order gets messed up,  give them the opportunity to fix it!   I bet it's  not easy making 100 different types of drinks and getting it perfect every time!"}
{"text":"I was very excited when this location opened. However- this is the worst Dunkin Donuts I have ever been to.  The customer service at this location is the absolutely awful.  They never get your order right and when they make a mistake they give you attitude.  How can you mess up a coffee with cream and sugar?!?!?!? I have had several bad experiences here and chalked it up to new people, bad days, etc. However, I can no except it any longer. I was there on 5/28/16 and Priscilla was so rude. After messing up my order twice and still giving me the wrong coffee. I look her straight in the face and presently said thank you. She looked at me sucked her teeth and pulled out her phone and started texting.  I will never go to this location again. I've made several complaints and nothing has been done. Furthermore- they charge the highest prices compared to the locations on South Blvd and Kings Drive."}
{"text":"Walked in at 7:45 on a Friday morning.. line had 19 people in front of me. Yikes. 

Not sure if they were understaffed or what, but what a cluster. One register open for a huge line in the store and in the drive-thru. Poor kid on the register (Nikko?) was really trying his hardest to stay pleasant. He was stressing. He had to bag donuts and ring by himself. Also had to restock as people were buying like 3 dozen at a time. 

Anyway. I ended up leaving there around 8:10. I hope they figure out their staffing or whatever it is that went wrong. And management needs to give that kid a pat on the back for not running out of there. 

My donut and coffee were fine, btw."}
{"text":"Huh, interesting to see how low the ratings are for this location! I usually went to the Dunkin Donuts on Alma School and Baseline. They always got my order wrong, like clockwork. So I usually would just order black iced coffee because they can't mess that up, right? Well once this Dunkin Donuts opened, I was very excited. Much closer to me, and they get my order right! All the time! Yay! lol and the staff is always friendly.

So I'm a fan of this location! I never get donuts though ever so I can't speak to the quality of that item. The only food item I get is a sausage+egg+english muffin+ketchup custom order and it's always fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"It's Dunkin Donuts-- but this so happens to be one of the nicest I've been in !! Friendly staff! THEY -- HAVE---A --- Fireplace !! Lol"}
{"text":"Bought a dozen donuts at 3:00 (half filled and half iced). When I got home and tried one of each they tasted worse than day old donuts...hard and stale. A total waste of money."}
{"text":"Are there any lactose free products? Servers have no idea what I am talking about. This information should be readily available."}
{"text":"Omg... like cats chasing their damn tales... don't know which machines are working...rude manager for refund... #messy back across the street to Starbucks at least they not RUDE!!"}
{"text":"For a frame of reference I go to a different location everyday on my way to work so I am familiar with how things are supposed to work.  This dunkin is consistently the worst.

Today I heard them barking at customers \"I SAID I will be with you in a second. Geez!\"

They are again out of cold brew, and common statement the last 4 times I've been here.  They are out of Ciabatta and rudely yelled it at the customer after me.  

The actually restaurant is poorly kept including the bathrooms.  This place desperately needs new management - the only way it's this consistently bad is if the management team here simple doesn't care or is inadequate."}
{"text":"I am writing this as my last will and testament as I am pretty sure I just drank poison. Upon the first sip of my non-fat Vanilla Latte, I thought something was off - way off. A subtle hint of coffee was present but something else was lurking as well. Feeling brave, I took another sip. Nope. Definitely poison. (Well, it tasted like hairspray which I'm pretty sure is poison if ingested.)  Too bad I was already back at work and no way was I driving back to DD. (What if I died while on the road?) Instead I dumped the whole thing down the drain. I then informed my co-worker that if I died to take the receipt from my purse and demand a refund to help pay for the funeral. He did not find this funny. 

I am giving this DD only one star as I did not actually die and the breakfast sandwich I purchased was just \"okay\". I guess there is a reason why Donuts is in their name - it's the only thing they really do well. I definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"Honestly this is the worst customer service I have ever had. I went through the drive thru & had 2 separate orders. My first order was the 2 for 3 muffin deal with 2 coffees. The next order was a bagel, hash browns & a coffee. When I pulled up I got a muffin and a coffee. I told him that I ordered the 2 for 3 and the guy says i only get 1 muffin. They also completely forgot about the rest of the second order. They didn't even give receipts. They told me to pull up and I'll get my muffin. Pulled up and I didn't even get my food.  I waited 10 minutes outside. I walked in and told them about not giving me a receipt and the food. MIND YOU THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF ME IF I PULLED UP. I waited 15 minutes inside & walked out because they couldn't even complete a damn order. They didn't even acknowledge me or apologize for anything!!!!"}
{"text":"The manager here is incredibly rude. Her attitude was ridiculous on the intercom. We complained about it at the window and the man there said \" yeah I know she's my boss.\" Gets even worse my husbands ice coffee is terrible!! We asked for a medium iced coffee with a little cream and sugar and the drink is white from cream and the bottom has an inch of sugar. Undrinkable."}
{"text":"Booo! You used to be 
Boomerangs! I miss the bar! 
Donuts are smaller."}
{"text":"I visit this Dunkin' Donuts 3-4 times a week and they mess up my order up 3 out of the 4 times!! The staff does not LISTEN to your order! This location is also more expensive than the other Dunkin' Donuts in Charlotte. They will not get another cent of my money. I am tired of having to call and return orders every SINGLE visit! Do yourself a favor make your own coffee at home!!"}
{"text":"Not sure how involved ownership is with this store but if they are not, they need to be... 8am on a Friday and they were pretty much out of everything. Not one bagel, hardly any donut holes and probably two muffins. How does this happen??? Thankfully there is a Bruegger's  across the street. Seems every time we stop here the place is in a state of chaos."}
{"text":"I love Dunkin Donuts - They have seriously good coffee, their larges are super gulps of lattes (which being the coffee whore I am, I love it!) and aren't pricey at all! They obviously have good donuts, but their breakfast sandwiches are pretty amazing as well. But I mostly love the fact that it's a drive through and I don't have to drag my lazy butt out of my car to get my coffee and carb fix!"}
{"text":"This location is not good!! They ran out of bagels, certain kinds of donuts and are very slow. I was really disappointed I ordered 12 dozen donuts they were okay, not fresh!. I order to breakfast sandwiches they were both cold and smashed. Also, the hash browns were burnt and did not taste good at all."}
{"text":"Maybe it was late in the day, and maybe they'd just been supremely busy. I don't know what hit that place but it was filthy. Every table I attempted to sit at was covered in crud and crumbs and the floor was a sticky mess too - even the staff looked disheveled and tired. The donuts were yum, bt wow, that place needs a deep clean......eurgh!"}
{"text":"We go to this Dunkin Donuts just about every time we viisit Arizona. Donuts are of course always fresh and service is good. I fell in love with the Vanilla Chai drink"}
{"text":"This is a horribly run location. EVERY SINGLE TIME WITHOUT FAIL THEY ARE OUT OF EVERYTHING. If you are kind enough to stick around and choose a substitute item you have a 80%  of it being out and your third choice will be accepted but then when you get the item, it will not be the correct one.  Starbucks has 2 locations within 1/2 a mile.....both in grocery stores with donuts......sorry Dunkin you just aren't up to par."}
{"text":"Looking for a sweet treat after dinner and decided to stop in. The selection was down right poor. Maybe half dozen types to pick from. I spotted a chocolate croissant and thought I would try it. The staff was quick and some what friendly. Went to sit down and there is no seats, not because it was busy there is hardly any seats inside. So we sat outdoors. 

The chocolate croissant I had was super dry like it had been out all day or left over from yesterday and there wasn't much chocolate. I know it's a donut shop but the selection was that low that is what I needed up getting. The kids got sprinkle donuts they were ok no real flavor. Best donut was my wife lemon one. However it was a hot mess with all the powder sugar on it. 

Honestly a disappointing overall visit."}
{"text":"This Dunkin is so cute! I love both the exterior and interior design. It's beautiful inside with plenty of places to sit. The environment is appealing and makes you want to hang out a while here.

My experience here was pretty good. When we were trying to order, one of the employees kept trying to talk to the cashier which was very inconsiderate. However, the cashier handled it very well and ignored the other employee and looked straight at us attentively waiting for our order. The other employee then apologized for interrupting the order. The bathroom was alright, cleaner than every other Dunkin I've been to, but could still use a little more attention as there was paper on the floor and toilet seat.

As for the food and drinks, the donut was excellent, and the coffee was below average. We ordered the Vanilla Cake Batter Donut, which was amazing! It was fresh, had a good amount of frosting and filling, and was overall a really delicious flavor. At other Dunkin locations I've visited, I've had a hard time finding fresh donuts and a good selection to choose from, but that wasn't an issue here. The coffee on the other hand was burnt. I have had this issue at several Dunkin locations and it seems to be more of a company wide issue. Both my boyfriend and I ordered iced coffees and they were both bitter and burnt tasting. They weren't very good, and after a few sips we ended up pitching them.

Overall, pretty decent experience here and definitely one of the better Dunkin locations I've visited!"}
{"text":"I just may officially be Done with Dunkin. Well, this location at least.

I will preface this by saying that sometimes it is the little things in life that keep us going, like finding a fiver in an old pair of jeans or pulling up to a parking meeter that already has 30 mins on it. This same holds true with store chain punch cards. On this day, I has enough punches on my DD sandwich card for a free breakfast sandwich and boy was I excited. 

As I handed my card to the cashier (who seemed a bit flustered already), he stared at it a if I had just tried to use foreign currency. After consulting with the manager, he returned and, with a haughty tone, informed me the \"this DD location does not honor the cards because we are a Kosher restuarant and our prices are higher\". Really? Did you really just say that? Pal, this is Dunkin Doughnuts. It costs 5 cents to make your sandwiches and I doubt the eggs in the sandwiches are even real egg. The cheese is sub par Kraft slices and not even melted, ever. Are you kidding me with this?

Needless to say I will not be back."}
{"text":"Has a number of tables inside-great for meetings or if you need a mobile office. The staff is on top of things too.

The only downside is the wifi has been spotty for a couple of months now and is currently unavailable."}
{"text":"Well I'll eat my words! The manager that was short with me called me personally to apologize. I think that takes a lot of guts! She really wanted to make it right, and offered me free coffees and donuts, but that's not at all necessary. I have a lot of respect for someone so kind to acknowledge my hurt feelings so sweetly. She made my day and I appreciate it!"}
{"text":"This store is horribly mismanaged.  Twice I have been into the store and had to wait for over 20 minutes to get a breakfast sandwich.  Today I walked in at 6:30am and after the person in line before me was served the clerk disappeared for about 8 minutes, then finally came back to take my order.  Perhaps he needed a bathroom break, but on a Saturday morning they should have had someone else up front.

It seems like they focus more on the drive through--just like my first visit, I stood at the counter for about 10 minutes after my order was placed and didn't get any attention until i asked how much longer it would be.  Had to show them my receipt as they didn't even know what I had ordered so I had to wait more for them to get the order started. 

While waiting I saw an employee stir coffee for a drive through order with a spoon, throw it down on the counter, then stir a separate coffee with it later on.  Gross.

Finally got my order and my \"crispy hashbrowns\" tasted like mushy grease soaked cotton balls.

I don't do fast food much, but I know that it can't be normal for it to be this bad."}
{"text":"Thanks for being rude when you got my order wrong and then just transferring the incorrect cheese from one sandwich to the other instead of putting new cheese on both sandwiches. Now my sandwich tastes like an everything bagel. Not exactly what I was looking forward to this morning. This location gets my order wrong more often than not. I think it's time to find a new breakfast place."}
{"text":"Just about every time I go to this location they are out of what I want. Bagels, ciabatta. 
This has been going on for a few months. 
I keep wanting to give them another chance since they are closest to me.
Whoever manages food order for this store needs to take into account weekends are busiest."}
{"text":"I've attempted to come into this locations few times and always end up leaving due to the long wait in the drive thru or ridiculously slow service of the front counter employee. I finally stuck it out and was really disappointed in the selection of donuts. I was looking for a few so y sprinkles or twists and unless I wanted some nasty pumpkin flavored ones with filling, plain or willing to pay extra for the larger sized cinnamon rolls etc then I was screwed. The guy at the counter talked to me like he was either tired, bored, or just annoyed he had to work. He never made any real eye contact and every time I ordered something he said what else, what else, lol Hey buddy I'll tell you what else without you repeating after every sprinkle ...but seriously I hate when the first person that is supposed to greet you doesn't even acknowledge you or make any type of eye contact. A great business will have their best employees and the ones with the greatest customer service skills handling that position. Friendly, energetic and quick service is so much better that what I received."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Dunkin Donuts and go there for my coffee very often! This is my first time at this location and I didn't have the best experience. An older man with gray braided hair was extremely rude while I was in the drive thru. I was deciding what I wanted (which took less than 20 seconds) and he said \"waiting on you\" and then made another rude comment when I was trying to order a second drink. I was so upset with this service that I left and went to the Starbucks near by instead. I'm not one to complain but I was pretty disappointed!"}
{"text":"No gift card holder? Or a bag to take my two boxes of K Cups? Awful. Worst DD I have ever been too. So bad in fact I tried to repress the memory of going here!"}
{"text":"99 cent iced tea and ice coffee all summer long !!!"}
{"text":"I went there this morning .... and the clerk was so rude to me. That's the last time I go back there!"}
{"text":"You guys need to work on your black coffee in the morning. Either it's bitter, or watered diwn not typical of the DD coffee im used to"}
{"text":"I'm rating this compared to other Dunkin Donuts I've been to.  I love the atmosphere with the fireplace and bookcases--very cozy compared to many other Dunkin Donuts.  They have a kosher menu which appeals to the neighborhood it's located in and makes it pretty unique, though personally I'd prefer the meat options too. The staff there are always friendly. The problem I have with this place is that they are always so incredibly so that there is a line no matter what time of day I go.  Often they don't even have both registers open and some staff look like they don't know what to do with themselves.  And when they get overwhelmed they start screwing up people's orders.  I typically order just a black coffee on my way to work and I'm usually in a hurry so having some efficiency is pretty important to me.  Especially when you have to pay the parking meters!

Update:  I'm taking this down another notch. Recently I was there and the person serving me was downright rude.  First she makes a comment that it was so unusual I ordered a large black coffee, because \"women never drink black coffee.\"  Really?!  Then even after making that comment she gives me a medium.  I say \"Excuse me, but I believe this is a medium.\"  First she ignores me, then after I try to get her attention again, she says \"Yep, it is.\"  So I then have to add \"So, do you remember that I ordered a large and that's what I paid for?\"  Then she grabs it from me and fixes it but is obviously pissy and annoyed about it and not apologetic at all.  If there were another Dunkin Donuts nearby I would never go to this location as the service is so awful.  I've never had such terrible service at a Dunkin Donuts before and I've been to many all over the country."}
{"text":"Went to dunkin this morning. The people that work there are rude. They look at you funny. No smiles. Slammed my coffee on the counter. It was and older man and woman. Looked of Indian descent. Possible owners. I only go to this  one sometimes because it is the closest to my house. But it the worst one around. Coffees are never right. Terrible customer service !!"}
{"text":"I went to this location around 4:30pm and they didn't have any popular menu items. I asked for a chocolate long john...didn't have it. Also asked for an assortment of munchkins and they only had cinnamon and powdered. Very disappointing. I also asked for light ice in my coffee and they failed to do that as well. 3/10 experience."}
{"text":"Awesome service! I accidentally sent my mobile order to a different location (and I was already late for work) and the team graciously offered to save me the trip and make my order anyways. Made my morning! :)"}
{"text":"This is the worst Dunkin Donuts I have ever been to and I stop in at Dunkin Donuts at lot when traveling. I have been to this location several times in the last year since I moved to the area and have been frustrated trying to pay every time. They always seem to have one of two registers open and if you are there for one item and want to pay and get out you have to wait. You wait on the people in front of you who may have large orders or are also just waiting to pay because the person at the one register has already started to ring up a larger order. No shortage of people working there as I always see a few working on preparing orders and a few taking orders. However no one ever opens up the second register and for some reason can't as I have received an \"I'm sorry but the other person has to ring you up\". Then you wait to pay for much longer than necessary. I have ordered coffee in the past and waited so long to pay the coffee is getting warm. They have no problem taking your order and preparing your coffee or getting a muffin but then you stand there looking at your order sitting there while you wait to pay. I have seen managers standing around chit chatting with employees or customers at the other end of the store with no clue on what is going on at the register. If the managers were doing a good job they would see the problem and open up a register to get people out the door. You would think that if they are only going to use one register they would not start to ring someone up until they were ready to pay. Not this place. No common sense here.

Well on today's visit, I was fourth in line and the people in front of me had larger orders than me. Standing fourth in line I was asked if I wanted just coffee or donuts and I said I just want one muffin. My muffin was bagged and put next to the register. I walked up to the second register expecting that I would be taken care of so I could pay and leave. Nope, the person standing next to the register apologized and said the other person had to ring me up. I waited a few minutes watching people run around preparing orders and the person at the register standing waiting for the order she started to ring up to be completed. I noticed other people waiting to pay and realized this was going to take a lot of time. I saw who I thought was the manager standing at the other end of the store talking to another employee so I called to him and asked if he was the manager. He was and I explained the situation. However I was so annoyed at this point I just told him he needed to open up another register and get the people out who were waiting to pay. He seemed out of touch with what was going on and that annoyed me too so I just said that I did not want my muffin, he could keep it and I would not be back.
I hope the person who owns this franchise reads this and wakes up to what is going on in this store."}
{"text":"Staff weren't very friendly. Service was extremely slow, and they weren't even busy. Typical donut I could get anywhere. Drink they recommend wasn't good, at all. Next time I'll visit Starbucks around the corner."}
{"text":"If you like dunkin donuts, this location will do. Who doesn't love Dunkin! The location unfortunately has a difficult parking lot."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. I have been numerous times and my order if never right. The drive thru is horrendous. Coffee is horrible. Twice its been cold. Not warm- actually cool. I keep trying to give it another chance- no more. It's absolutely awful."}
{"text":"I'm gonna keep it one hunnid like I always do, and I can tell you I have liked every time coming here

I normally go through the drive thru and just get myself a large cold brew. Normally everything is perfect with it but once they were out of cold brew at noon.. the NICEST employee they have who always helps me at the drive thru said they would just give me and iced coffee instead. And that they did. They gave it to me and apologized. Tbh I just needed caffeine so I was grateful for that gesture

One time I did go into the place and my toddler was being difficult so I bought him a donut and he also wanted just a sausage patty (because #toddlerdiets) and although they were slightly confused, they made my son happy and gave him exactly what he wanted. I didn't see them out of any donuts that day either, although it was early in the morning. Seemed well stocked and pretty busy. The inside is actually very nice and it was clean. 

After going here atleast a dozen times I can say that the cold brew is awesome, the employees are flexible/understanding and accommodating, and the restaurant was clean inside. They had a fully stocked line up of donuts and they paid for my iced coffee when the cold brew wasn't available. 


s/o to the drive thru guy who's hella fast and nice- Thomas? Tommy? Idk something like that but he deserves credit"}
{"text":"In my book Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks are on the top tier of the coffee shop pyramid. Because this Dunkin Donuts is a couple hundred feet north of Starbucks in this Wal-Mart power center, this location is the opportune review to compare the strengths and weaknesses of each chain using characteristics of these locations.

FOOD

   Dunkin Donuts blows Starbucks out of the Phoenix Valley when it comes to food. Whereas I am a fan that goes back to my teen years of Dunkin Donuts toasted bagels with cream cheese, I regard Starbucks bagels as filler food that tastes equivalent to a supermarket bagel. Dunkin Donuts signature donuts are the bomb. Starbucks pastries are filling yet forgettable.

COFFEE

    Long before Starbucks landed on New York soil in the 90s, Dunkin Donuts coffee was the ultimate cup of Joe. In a way Dunkin Donuts is still the ultimate cup of Joe. In my mind their coffee is slightly better than Starbucks. Especially with their added light blueberry syrup.

PRICE

   Dunkin Donuts coffee is relatively the same price as Starbucks. Whether I buy a coffee with syrup or ice blended coffee beverage at Dunkin Donuts or Starbucks, the difference in price is relatively zilch.

SERVICE

   Dunkin Donuts trails behind Starbucks in service. Especially at these locations. At Dunkin Donuts, one man was manning the shop. If there was a rush in business, this would cause customer service issues. On the other hand Starbucks had a crew of employees. The woman who took my order was very charming and friendly. Dunkin Donuts service does have one advantage over Starbucks, which is the employees put in the cream and sugar for you.

COFFEE SHOP EXPERIENCE

  As far as a place to hang out, Dunkin Donuts trails far behind Starbucks. This is another Dunkin Donuts where the subliminal message is to sip your coffee eat your food and move on. Starbucks on the other hand promotes hanging out with complimentary WiFi and comfortable seating."}
{"text":"Great location right off of Statesville Road north of Gilead. Drive around back and either drive through the drive-thru or park and step inside. Either way you pop back out onto 21 and go your merry way.
Stop here more often than advisable if it was only for me that I stop in. Have never done the drive-up here because I picture donut selection rapidly becoming a weird game of \"Go Fish\" (got any lemon?...)
and when you go inside it's the greatest mass market donut show on earth with an ice cream side show! Chocolate glazed, chocolate frosted, double chocolate, chocolate cream, boston cream, bavarian cream, and so on until you get to toasted coconut! it seems like at least 30 flavors and you can get an different iced cream for each.
Maybe I'm just doing this right but the staff is always pleasant and efficient when we trade dollars for donuts, and I like when that happens."}
{"text":"Love dunkin donuts but unfortunately this location is the closest to our house, and I hate leaving bad reviews but as someone who works in customer service I feel the need to complain. 

I have family in town from out of state where there are no DD and so my Aunt and I ran in to get some donuts. 
We finished paying and my aunt accidentally knocked over the yellow wet floor sign, I looked at the two employees behind the register, a young guy and a girl with a bunch of tattoos were whispering to each other, my aunt was trying to recover from the shock of the loud sound we were giggling, and with our hands full of our donut orders we couldn't pick up the sign.

I thanked them for serving us... While they didn't acknowledge us thanking them and apologizing for knocking over the sign due to them still whispering and glaring at us.

We started to walk to the door, and the girl with tattoos yells \"I'll pick it up!\" I turn and apologize again and say thank you, in a super friendly tone. 

She said it 2 more times and I looked her In the face and said thank you so much, and she said \"I got it\" and I just smiled at her and she didn't smile or say its ok or nothing. 

My aunt and I kinda had a laugh about her poor customer service and snarky attitude but when we got home our donuts were DRY!!!! ugh why DD you let me and my visitors down!"}
{"text":"One of the many Dunkin' Donuts that I visit. The location is not the greatest at busy traffic times. They have a nice size seating area. My main concern is that my hot coffee is hot and it is. Typically I use the drive through but if I do go in they usually are pretty stocked on the donuts."}
{"text":"thanks for locking up shop an hour early tonight.  closing time is posted as 9:00.  i guess the employees had something better to do?  drove over there, got there at 8, and lights were out with doing some clean up.  waste of my time."}
{"text":"My husband and I were so excited to have a Dunkin near our house. Perfect for our morning commutes or our late night sweet treat cravings. Well, this location has been such a disappointment so far. I hate saying this but so many of the staff members have messed up many of our orders. I enjoy just almond milk in my iced coffee - twice now employees have handed me coffee that was white as snow trying to tell me that the drink was in fact with almond milk. NO. Almond milk does not make your iced coffee white like cream. One taste and I could spit it out...CREAM. We gave it another shot this morning...stale donuts. Stale donuts on a Saturday morning. Unreal. Not the first time either we've had terrible donuts from this location. For how new this location is, they've had an incredibly poor start. They have a lot to work on."}
{"text":"Don't go here at night. The workers are on their cell phones and are annoyed when you go through the drive thru. Donuts are stale and they can't make coffee correctly."}
{"text":"I couldn't bite all the way through the chicken biscuit. So I just ate the biscuit. Super weak. Dude asks me if I want sprinkles on my chocolate frosted donut. Doesn't give me sprinkles?!? 

w.t.f."}
{"text":"Literally the slowest Dunkin Donuts I have been to. Just took 20 minutes to get a simple breakfast samdwich unreal. And they ran out of most of their donuts."}
{"text":"The DD is close to my home. I'm probably there more than I should be. I love their Iced Coffee and Iced Tea. The employees are always friendly. Two great reasons to be there so much."}
{"text":"The customer service is horrible. I went in at 11:00am on Saturday and there were literally less than 12 donuts. A lady behind me yelled out above me while I'm in the middle of my order and actually called dibs, to which the girl taking MY order stopped my order, removed the two donuts the lady behind me yelled out that she wanted, and then proceeded to tel me they were now out of those too.....but at least the smile never left her face

I was asked three times by the same girl, within 1 1/2 minutes if I was going to order coffee. Three times I said no thank you. 

Apparently it is normal to have nothing but coffee to choose from after 11am on all days of the week. I almost felt bad for the cashier, enough not to mention her name but not enough to say I would not hire her and I would not hire the manager of this store. 

The two stars are for the Boston cream donut because they did have 4 of those and I took them all. I was hoping for a dozen of any variety but I was out of luck. I'll go to LaMars next time I have a craving. It's not worth my fuel to give this Dunkin Donuts another chance."}
{"text":"This this the WORST Dunkin Donuts location and I will NEVER go back. This location is so bad, that I'm not sure if I will ever go to a Dunkin Donuts again. I have been to this location multiple times, and have not once had a pleasant experience. Below is just one example of the absolutely miserable service I have received from this location:

What I ordered: 2 chocolate cake donuts, 2 bagels not toasted with cream cheese on the side, 1 pepsi, and 1 lg iced coffee.

What I received: 1 chocolate glazed donut, 1 vanilla glazed donut, 2 toasted bagels, A pepsi, and a hot coffee. 

The only thing they managed to get right from my order was the bottled pepsi. I can't understand what was so difficult about the order for that to be what I received; and, as I said before, this is not the first time my order was completely and thoroughly wrong. 

To place the cherry on top of this experience, the customer service was atrocious. As I was receiving the incorrect pieces of my order, I handed them back to the gentleman at the window and let him know it was incorrect. I did not receive an apology or explanation. He simply walked away to get the correct food with an attitude as if I was inconveniencing him! While waiting for my order to be corrrected, another employee came to the window and asked me to pay the amount that was owed for the car behind me - this was AFTER he originally took my money for my order!

It's honestly unbelievable and utterly ridiculous that this location is in business. I will NEVER return and I'm writing this review so that others do not waste their time. It would be a miracle if your order is even half correct at this location. Unfortunately, the multiple experiences I have had here have ruined my vision of Dunkin Donuts and I do not think I will ever be a customer of theirs again."}
{"text":"OK. So in Yelp terms, 2 stars is \"Meh. I've experienced better\" and yes...I've experienced better.

Sure, DD is a chain but it has damn good iced coffee. Not as great as my obsession, Black Cat in Arcadia, but it's not the burnt swill 'Bucks peddles. (Hey, I love me some afternoon wi-fi stealing at Starbucks, but admit it. Their burnt coffee is not that great.)

What kills me about this DD location are the dips who work the drive-thru. I don't understand why it's so HARD! Granted, I've never worked in fast food but I really don't think 2 medium iced coffees (the only thing we've ever ordered) should be confusing. TWICE the person working (2 separate girls) asked my boyfriend if by \"light cream\" he meant a lot of cream or almost no cream?

 \"So...light on the cream. Do you mean you want us to put a lot in there, or not a lot?\" I just...Wait. What? HOW do you not know this?

Last time we went, they said back \"OK 2 iced coffees\" then had only one ready. Where did the breakdown in communication happen? 

I'm sure we'll go back because, like I said, DD coffee is pretty delish. But man. Meh. I've experienced better."}
{"text":"Always extremely slow, inadequate and unable to even get orders right. Multiple times there was no filling in their Boston Cream donuts. Very disappointing! They need to take notes from DD on Ray and Higley they always rock."}
{"text":"I pulled into the drive thru at 6:05am, with one car ahead of me at the ordering menu. By the time I pulled up to the counter to pay at the drive thru it was now 6:20. No one acknowledged me for at least 3-5 mins. When the cashier finally came over she gave me my total and before I paid I told that I think she missed my donut because my total seemed low, she took my card and threw it on the counter and walked to get the donut, with an attitude, she came back and handed me my drinks and food. I didn't receive a receipt so I'm not even sure if I was charged correctly. The cashier was a heavier set female with short dark hair, the food receipt attached to my bag said \"Angel R.\" When I drove away I realized my chai tea was missing a good 2 inches of drink. I ordered a large and there was noticeably a gap to the top of the cup. The other drink I ordered was filled to the rim, so I was a bit confused and irritated, I come to this location multiple times a week and this specific employee always has a bad attitude. Attached is a picture of the drink I received as soon as I pulled out of the drive thru. I would've went in to say something but from ordering to leaving took 15-20 mins and I had my sleeping 2 year old in the backseat. I'm very disappointed with her customer service and the quality of my order."}
{"text":"Great location just off of University Blvd. near Robert Morris University. They have my favorite vanilla chai! Better than Starbucks! Great service!"}
{"text":"Not sure what was up with this DD but when you order and there are literally two customers in the store it should not take ten minutes to get a medium coffee with one sugar and cream. As I waited at the end of the counter three employees walked back and forth bs'ing and paid me no attention. Finally one nice young lady asked what I was waiting for and took it upon herself to get my order taken care of. After that I tried really hard to like the place but just couldn't. The music was loud and as I watched the employees it seemed like they were more interested in hanging out and talking and that customers were tolerated but really not why they were there. Having been a loyal Starbucks guy and hoping that this Dunkin would be the catalyst for a change it failed miserably. And to boot I wasn't at all impressed by the coffee either. I have lots of friends who swear by DD and I'm not sure why. Looks like it's back to 61B and Starbucks."}
{"text":"Somewhere between a three and four, but they have a drive-thru so that pushes them to the higher number. I wish all coffee shops had drive-thrus. Why? So no one can see me in my pajamas or make up from the previous evening. 

I used to drive by this place every day for nine years on my way to work. I leave and then they finally open a DD next door. Thanks universe. It's a Dunkin. You know what you're going to get. This one is way better than the Graham Street location. My orders are always correct and the wait is never long. 

Note: you can only exit the lost in one direction onto Morehead Street. You can't exit onto Freedom."}
{"text":"This place has been open for a few months now and still doesn't have its act together.  One time it took them 3 attempts to make me the correct sandwich.  The dining area is consistently dirty.  I'll just put up with the traffic/construction on Graham Road and go to that DD."}
{"text":"I am an east-coast Dunkin Donuts girl born and raised. I love my D&D, but the operations here in AZ leave a lot to be desired. I don't know if its the \"laid-back\" attitude of AZ, but generally there is always a line in this store, they rarely open the 2 registers they have and people are yelling over a glass partition if they can get you coffee. I visit this store regularly because it's right around the corner from my house. It's always loaded with kids and families on the weekends letting their 5 kids each choose their own donuts like they are selecting their future house (seriously, its sugar, fat and carbs). I don't know why it's so hard to have 2 people run the register and have \"coffee-runners\" and \"donut-gatherers\" to make this a more efficient operation. I come here because I love the coffee - sometimes it's such a hassle that I go to McDonald's and get my coffee there instead."}
{"text":"The Dunkin Donuts here sucks the employees are rude and they are always out of frosted donuts. I mean really how can Dunkin Donuts be out of donuts? ridiculous!!"}
{"text":"Ugh. Disappointed AGAIN. Every time we go to this particular dunkin' we are greatly disappointed in their donut selection. So I decided to not be a content complainer And email corporate dunkin' donuts customer service. I got a prompt reply, including an apology, a plan on how they will be improving, and a coupon for a free half dozen donuts. I was so excited! So after 2 and a half months of not going simply because I've been broke we go for coffee and donuts and they only have three types of donuts available, two of the kinds (lemon and pumpkin) they only have 3 ready and the other type is just the plain \"old fashioned\" donuts, ew. They took forever to make our coffees despite not being busy (only one woman who ordered a bagel besides us), and the woman who took our order clearly had no idea what she was doing. Overall I'm most upset about the donut situation and misleading customer service interaction I had, I will be going to Star Donuts and/or Starbucks from now on which breaks my heart being a New England gal."}
{"text":"The worst workers in the world!!! These people working are just airheads! They do everything the opposite way... MANAGEMENT SUCKS!!!!"}
{"text":"We live in Southern California, but we were out here for a family trip.

Dunkin Donuts recently moved out to Southern CA, but I haven't had the opportunity to try the CA location so I jumped on this location when I saw it during our walk. I'm very disappointed after all the hype of how amazing this place was. 

We ordered their famous iced coffee, bagel breakfast sandwich, and their maple glazed donut. The best part of our experience was how quickly the food came out, however the food was gross. The bagel sandwich was cold, and the bagel was not toasted and tasted old. The iced coffee had no flavor other than milk and sugar. The donut frosting left a fatty film on the roof of our mouths after eating, and it was one of the worst donut I've ever eaten.

I will never try Dunkin Donuts again."}
{"text":"I got an iced coffee. Really it was a cup of ice with milk and a dash of coffee. Now I have to go to Starbucks. Oh ya. They also forgot my hash browns. Not happy."}
{"text":"Slowest service ever! Drive thru is meant to be quick. Between ordering and picking up (Yesterday 5:39am-5:47am), it took 8 minutes. This location needs help."}
{"text":"Ok, so I love coffee, especially from places like Dunkin Donuts.  I mean, its how coffee should be.  Not over roasted burnt beans, at crazy prices served by people in green aprons.....just really good coffee, along with some donuts and muffins.

Apparently, this location just opened, and its exciting to see another DD in the valley.....the coffee is great, pastries are awesome, and its at reasonable prices, with awesome hours and wifi.   This place has a drive thru as well!  Parkings kind of a pain in the butt (small, cramped lot with crappy drivers and loads of people blazing through the lot to get to the drive thru.)

When I'm back in the area, I'll be sure to stop back in and hang out here, as its worth the time and effort!"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service.  Coffee and a fresh donut were as expected -- here at 10 am and donuts were pretty picked through, so choices were limited-  the store was very dirty trash overflowing floors not swept - unpleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Was on the go...and went through the drive through to get a donut and a breakfast sandwich for my family. They gave me the donut and said to wait for my sandwich. So I wait.  Then someone comes to the window and asks what I'm waiting for.  Um, my sandwich, that I paid for?  It was sitting on the counter, the whole time.  
Derp!"}
{"text":"Been through twice in the last month, about 4 weeks apart - both times the Coolatta machine was out of order.  While I was told it was out of order \"today\" an employee confirmed it rarely works.  Its going to be 100° here for the next 4 months...they should probably get that fixed especially because they have huge billboards for it in the windows!!"}
{"text":"Only go if you want a basic donut. 4 times in a row they have been out of the one we want. Seriously you are a donut shop. You have one job. Make donuts. Otherwise the shop is cute inside but going to head to Bosa for donuts as I'm tired of being told they are out of freakin long johns week after week."}
{"text":"Dunkin' Donuts is Dunkin' Donuts! It's pretty regular across the board. 

This location was new and clean. The staff seemed really nice and the coffee was actually really good. While it is a chain, I think some places the coffee is not always as on point as it is at others.  This place was on point today and the staff was really nice! 

Would return again. Plus the Dunkin app - love it!"}
{"text":"This is a good location for a DD's and I really like the fact that there is a pretty big parking lot behind it. There are plenty of seats if you are staying and free wifi. All the food tasted like regular DD's food."}
{"text":"We went to the drive through today got our donuts and were asked to drive up front while we wait for a few hash browns. He came out with the bag and still no receipt. Not only does this location complain when we ask for a military discount wanting the id before giving the discount. One time I went in with a text from my husband with same address same name etc and they gave a fit about him not being w me. Then we had my son with our credit card and husbands license with the logo veterans on it. They gave my son trouble saying next time he needs the actually military I'd. We don't have that we have it on our license and never had an issue at any other place.  As the DMV will not put this on your licence with out proof of this. So today no receipt and we wanted to make sure we got the receipt and got the discount. After waiting in line then our front. My husband had to go inside to get the receipt. We called as soon as we left and Will the manager on today had no idea about the policy when they don't give a receipt. From another location in surprise said they are to refund the whole order. And Will said he had no idea about that policy and would give us 6 donuts. If your a manager on staff that day you should know policy's or ask someone. How are you going to learn."}
{"text":"Came here before running around. We ordered a sausage and egg cresant, 3 Chocolate iced with sprinkle donuts, and 1 glazed donut. We also ordered a large carmel iced coffee with extra carmel and a coke along with a cup of ice. Our total came out to 12.20 which was fine. When we got our order they didnt even give us the cup of ice we paid for, and when we asked for it they gave us the cup of ice with no lid and no straw. Also they place the napkins in the bag with the donuts. Chocolate icing alllll over the napkins... Arent they supposed to place each donut in wax paper type stuff? How do we know they even have gloves on while getting these donuts into the bags? The donuts seemed to be very freshly made.. As if they just iced them because the icing hasnt even set yet and it was dripping every time i tried to take a bite. They were fresh and tasted pretty good but the service here is terrible and they do not have good order accuracy. This needs to be improved on because they just lost a person who loves donuts and coffee.. Me. I will take my business elsewhere until they know how to package food in their bags and actually get an order right."}
{"text":"This is a really great DD location.  It's nice to have a place with fasting friendly food during Lent in the neighborhood (because it's kosher and vegetarian, there are some vegan options to be had here)!  The staff are friendly and the decor is nice, especially the working gas fireplace.  The only thing that prevents me from giving it 5 stars is that it is frequently packed with middle and high schoolers after school and on the weekends, making it a less appealing place to study or read than Starbucks or other coffee shops in the neighborhood.  I don't mean to sound like a crochety old man, but sometimes it's very difficult to focus in here.  Then again, I'm a Boston native, so you know I'm still coming here anyway on principle for nostalgia's sake.

Also: for those complaining about the lack of non-vegetarian options - you need to understand the complexity of keeping a kosher kitchen would prevent this location from serving meat products -they would need to ritually cleanse the kitchen and have rabbinical blessings all the time.  It is much simpler not to bring meat into the mix to keep a secular business kosher!"}
{"text":"Stopped inside and couldn't even get waited on. Drive thru girl kept saying she would be right with me. Then she said a manager would come up. Finally saw the manager but she chose to stop and clean up a few things before coming to the counter. I had been there about 10 minutes by then. I waited a few more minutes and I just left. Horrible customer service!!"}
{"text":"From the reviews I see here waiting is a problem, BUT mainly from the people not knowing what donuts they want. PEOPLE please know the donuts and have your money ready before getting to the counter.

I stop today and yes the line was a little long, but due to th reason I stated above. 

Pro:
Friendly service
Coffee being stir mixing the cream the cream and sugar...Yes this place actually does this for it customers.

Con:
Lines could be better"}
{"text":"Brand-new location. Definitely an improvement for the neighborhood. Dunkin' Donuts has wonderful coffee, great donuts, and great personnel. Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This place has been remodeled. They have NEW OWNERS (I hope!)...the previous owners kept the place pretty dirty and gross.

What's there to not love about DONUTS from DD? 

ok...yes, they are full of sugar and they are deep fried. Not good for you, but they taste yummy, esp the Munchkins....which are so easy to just keep popping these little donuts into your mouth one after another....stop me!

I love DD coffee...but, I DON'T like that they add the milk/cream for you. Why do they do that? Why can't I add my own? Do they think I won't know how? 

They added WAY too much--my coffee was so rich with half & half, I had to add more coffee to it when I got home. What was the point of ordering coffee out, when I ended up making a pot of it at home? Geez!"}
{"text":"I really love this Dunkin' Donuts location because it's all kosher and vegetarian. I squealed with delight when I ordered an egg croissant with a vegetarian sausage and cheese. I don't think I've ever been able to do that at a fast-food restaurant! This is certainly the star point for me. I wouldn't go to Dunkin' Donuts otherwise. 

The donuts here are a little more unique too. I can't remember names, but there are specialty donuts that I have never seen before. That's a plus! 

The coffees are pretty tasty, and they are a fraction of the price of Starbucks. However, they can be a bit sweet! I think next time I will order one of the non-sugar ones instead. 

The environment here is busy and friendly. I've never had a bad experience at this location. The staff and patrons are usually there with a big ol' smile on their face. 

If you're a vegetarian, and you want something quick and very cheap, this is definitely the place to go! You can even get something moderately healthy if you play your cards correctly, and you can't really beat that."}
{"text":"Only have apple fritters about 20% of the time when I visit.  The radio was pure static tonight.  Hugely irritating.  Donuts are usually good when I can get the one I want."}
{"text":"My new go to option other than Starbucks.  Don't get me wrong still like the iced tea and pastry selection from Starbucks but for sandwiches, coffee selections and of course donuts, without all the traffic congestion and hassle, you just can't beat this Dunkin' Donuts location.  Make sure you try the 'Order on the Go' option (Dunkin Donuts app) it is super quick and very convenient."}
{"text":"Swung into the newly erected Dunkin' Donuts to see what possibly could have brought this franchise to my neighborhood. I was in dire need of some breakfast goodness and liked the sound of the Angus Steak and Egg Sandwich. So I picked up two sandwiches, one for myself and one for my roommate, who was languishing at home, pajama-bound on a lazy Sunday. I even grabbed a couple of donuts for \"dessert\".

All I can say is that I was underwhelmed. I don't know if I've ever had a blander breakfast sandwich. Fortunately, I had all manner of condiments at home to make this breakfast bagel palatable, but this required some serious help. Mayo, sriracha, and Worcestshire helped me get past the barely-there flavors of what should've been a fantastic breakfast sandwich experience. The donuts were equally \"meh\", as I have had far better donuts made locally.

I would've given one star for my complete disappointment in the menu items, but the service here was friendly and fairly prompt. So I award an extra star. I only hope that the familiar brand name inspires loyal customers, because I honestly don't understand the appeal."}
{"text":"Completely understaffed. Unorganized. It's Friday morning.  Get some people behind the counter."}
{"text":"Just to keep track... I made the mistake of stopping here again yesterday. No caramel to make a caramel latte. The manager just does not care. As fun as it has been to track Dunkin's screw ups through my yelp reviews, this will be the last. I won't make the mistake of going here again. LOL"}
{"text":"It seems like the baristas never get my coffee right & I only order from two different iced coffee flavors. They can also be so rude. Unfortunately, it's the closest DD close to me. I'm always afraid to go to this DD because they rarely get my order correct, so I rarely go as well. Hopefully they improve..."}
{"text":"This is actually a ZERO star review!! I had the worst customer service of my life here and will not come here again regardless of it being more convenient than Bosa because of the drive thru!! I don't know the woman's name who was taking orders through the drive thru (short blonde hair) but she is absolutely one of the rudest people I have ever dealt with!! I told her I wanted a mixed dozen and started telling her what I wanted and she rudely interrupted and said \"a mixed dozen doesn't give you the option to choose what donuts you want, that would be assorted but whatever I guess start listing off what you want for something you didn't order.\" I told her I didn't know there was a difference between mixed or assorted and continued on with my order where she continued to make snide comments!! She was extremely rude and I will not spend money at a place who doesn't take pride in who they hire.  If higher management reads these reviews please take a look at who was working this morning (June 20, 2017) at this location around 9:30am and give this girl some training on customer service cause she needs a class or two or ten!! 


Update:  A year, almost to the date, I decided to give Dunkin another try!! Unfortunately I see that management doesn't read reviews because I had another horrible experience here today.  RUDEST EMPLOYEES AROUND!! The woman who helped me this morning obviously hates her job and was very rude to my family and I when we ordered our donuts!! We only ordered three things so not an order to get nasty about.  I really set her off by asking if there was a vanilla frosted donut available.  After an obvious eye roll, she rudely pointed and said it's right there.  My bad, didn't see it!! Even the customers in line behind me were in shock at how this girl acted towards me!! She needs customer service lessons stat!! Dunkin Donuts - start training your employees to be nice to customers!!"}
{"text":"I love DD but this one makes my coffee right everytime. I just moved to the area and they ate always Fast and have friendly service."}
{"text":"Free deserves 5 stars!  For March 2010, a medium hot or iced coffee is FREE at participating Scottsdale Dunkin Donuts.  Yep, FREE.  You don't even have to buy a donut - but really, who wouldn't?!
:)"}
{"text":"OK - these guys need to go back to school.  They replace their counter staff about every two days - and they should.  I stood in line for a cup of decaf that was poured from a thermal carafe and tasted at least a day old. The guy behind me stood in line for no less than 10+ minutes, only to find out they did not have a jelly donut to sell him.

WHY is it so hard to make a good cup of coffee and a provide a jelly donut?
Becuase whoever owns this Dunkin Donuts probably doesn't know a damn thing about customer service, consistency, or business.

Watch for this one to be gone in a few months - if that long."}
{"text":"When it first opened had a great and friendly staff. Today, was not an example of that. 

My wife and I ordered two iced drinks and some \"large statured\" female with blonde hair working the window could NOT have been ruder. I simply asked which coffee was which---they looked exactly the same and she says \"The one...in your hand... is a latte\" as snotty as you can get. I said \"thanks\" and she glared at me and after a good 5 seconds of an angry glare says \"yeah, have a nice day!\". 

Okkk...Here's the thing, there are plenty of folks who need a job and who can be nice for at least 30 seconds! This DD needs to find one!"}
{"text":"Be careful.  During morning commute I decided to stop at this restaurant with a young child because they were starving. we ordered breakfast sandwiches.  we were struck by a stinking eggy smell as we opened our bags.  I new the eggs were rotten but couldn't believe it!!!!!  I can still remember that nauseating scent!!!  Stay away"}
{"text":"This is Dunkin donuts. What can you review about a chain restaurant? I can say that this location is always very clean, the staff is very fast and always smiling. There is a TV on the wall that is tuned to the national news channel to watch if you have to wait in line, which I never have."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure what they're doing whether it's killing the donut animal to make your donuts or picking the beans in South America but this is the slowest drive-thru in history. I just sat in my car for 25 minutes. They're definitely understaffed at this location which leads to a lot of wrong orders and slow service. I need to find another location but the coffee is better than other Dunkins I've been to. I guess I shouldn't be that picky considering my coffee is $2."}
{"text":"Got a coffee and a chocolate donut from the drive thru and the coffee was cold and the donut looked the it fell off the truck last week. I drive the 15 mins home to eat the donut until I say what was in the bag and it almost made me sick. Try to call and get my money back and was told I would have to bring it back. Not worth my gas."}
{"text":"New DD location. Very nice facility, clean, and the staff is doing okay, although it'll take them a while to get fully up to speed. One note of caution - parking and traversing the property. Minimal parking, and it's tight in there in front. Be careful exiting - the Forest Hills PD don't play, and they will enforce the no left onto Filmore to access Ardmore.
Once everything is in sync, another great spot for coffee and delicious fat pills...er, I mean doughnuts!"}
{"text":"Legitimately the WORST location ever. I moved here in August and was thrilled Dunkin was so close to school and home. I'm better off driving to the location off of Thunderbird than walking to this one! Not only do the manager lack respect for the employees (as I have witnessed public berating of the staff while in), but the entire staff lacks any concern for the customers and getting them timely service. 

I spent 15 minutes waiting for a coffee that was never made because the manager training the cashier never wrote a cup out for my drink. But took the time to reorganize the sale displays, even walking past me several times and never once asking what I waiting for or may have needed.  I'm now late for my engagements for the day.  
Another woman had a hot coffee which she sent back because it \"wasn't hot at all.\" 

Officially learned my lesson and will be going to the Starbucks in the same parking lot from now on. The coffee is NOT worth the aggravation of saving a few dollars."}
{"text":"Walk in around 830am no customers Inside walk right up the the register older man is there said \"What can I get cha?\"
I rambled off my order and said, 
\"Can I get a LARGE water?\"
Employee: there's bottled water for purchase
Me: I want a LARGE water
Employee: small is the only thing I can give you for free 
Me: I'll pay for it I want a LARGE water
Employee: I have no way of ringing it up 
Me: Ohok I'll just go fuck myself"}
{"text":"I used to love going to this Dunkin' Donuts and would go there almost every day. Now they barely can make my coffee right and most of the time I can't even drink it it's so nasty. No matter how specific I am with them on how to make my drink they still cannot get it right."}
{"text":"If I could give this location zero stars I would. Management and their employees need to get their ish together!!!"}
{"text":"I love Dunkin Donuts coffee. Everywhere I go, I search for Dunkin Donut locations. This particular location did not impress. While in town, I visited this location twice!  First visit, customer service was a little slow. Second visit, My coffee was cold!!! I had been waiting all day for this cup, and I was left disappointed. On a positive note, the order I placed on my second visit was large, 7 drinks and they offered to help carry the drinks to my car and all of the orders were accurate. For the remainder of my stay in town, I drove  a few extra miles to go to a different location and the service was much better, and the coffee was hot!"}
{"text":"I've only been to this location once, so maybe my review is not the most accurate but I will briefly mention how I felt when I did go.. 

I think Michele K's review below really hits the nail on the head. I drink plain black coffee so, really, it's kind of hard to screw that up. The coffee was okay, but the service is what made me say \"meh.\" The employees don't really seem to want anyone there. I don't even think I was greeted when I walked in, and I remember standing there with my fiancée for a while before someone reluctantly came to the counter. 

For me, it's very difficult to hand over my money to someone who is less than thrilled to take my order. Honestly, I would much rather go to the Starbucks on Alma School and Elliot and know that the service will be good, along with the coffee."}
{"text":"I love dunkin coffee it's my favorite because its inexpensive and taste great... that being said we have been sitting here for like an hour enjoying our coffee and have watched people come in and out because NO ONE IS AT THE COUNTER. Repeat question they keep asking is... does anyone work here? We got lucky and came in when a girl was at the counter, she went home already lol but this other kids that came is always hiding. How are you supposed to get customers if you are not around? It's not busy by any means at all but seriously they need a bell or something because no one can get him to come up. I like this location but I think drive thru will be my only option from now on..."}
{"text":"Nice new DD.  Recently opened with a brand new building.  Friendly staff with a fast check out. Good DD coffee and your usually selection of donuts, danish, muffins, sandwiches.
there is a drive thru and WiFi."}
{"text":"This Dunkin' Donuts has a 2-Star average at the time of this writing? Say what??? 

After reading the reviews, it mostly relates to the staff being rude because they're teenagers. Um ... have you ever met a teenager? No excuse, I understand, and they should be better trained. But they sell Munchkins! Therefore, 5 Stars."}
{"text":"Conveniently located in Surprise right after the entrance/exit ramps to the 303 and a couple stores next the Safeway supermarket.  Parking is sufficient.  The establishment was a bit dirty (-1) - tables were dirty and floor was dirty.  It was well lit and not too cramped.  At the time I visited, it was empty which was a plus for me.  Staff was friendly and service was fast.
Food items didn't taste fresh, though not stale as I had a glazed donut and another in my party had a reduced-fat muffin.  Also complemented the order with a Hazelnut Swirl latte which was cold and tasty.
Will be back because it's conveniently located for me and I'm a fan of Dunkin Donuts."}
{"text":"Every time I come here they are out of jelly filled munchkins . You would think they would make more if they are always out . If I get hashbrowns they are always cold and soggy when I go thru the drive thru. Inside they come out hot and taste good . I will have to start driving to the new Dunkin on Waddell just to get what I want"}
{"text":"I went through the drive-thru yesterday and was served by Angel. She truly is an angel. I had a \"oh no what did I do because I haven't had my coffee yet\" moment. Angel went over and above to fix MY problem. She was quick and courteous and I had my corrected order in under two minutes. She is a star employee."}
{"text":"The woman who works weekday early mornings is always so happy and delightful. The drive through goes by pretty quickly and everything has always been yummy!"}
{"text":"My morning needed a pickup, so I thought I would change things up and an Americano was the perfect solution, but it was delivered so full that I could not hold it in my hands. 

I could not drink it nor could I put it down. Unfortunately, this led me to making a big mess in front of the pickup zone inside the store. Yikes! An accident waiting to happen for another guest. I asked for help and the three ladies behind the counter looked at me like I was stopping the Super Bowl. No help was forthcoming. In fact they were quite rude to me leaving me essentially stranded without an offer of help or another drink. I left without my coffee and a huge mess in the floor. Not what I had in mind. :( 

Please train the staff to have just a bit more concern for the customer experience, You never know who is coming threw the door for a cup of Americano. It could be the CEO of a company the when left with a bad 1st impression, will tell all associates.."}
{"text":"Spend 10 bucks on donuts, get stale donuts. Literally went around noon for a quick snack and got a few things including 10 glazed munchkins. I threw 9 out of 10 out because they were harder than a rock. What a disappointment. It's sad when circle k donuts are better than \"Dunkin DONUTS\""}
{"text":"I went to a different Dunkin and bought an ice coffee. It tasted burnt so I bought it back to this one. The manager was SO nice! Not only did she replace my coffee with a new one, but she gave me a donut for all of my troubles. She even went as far as to make me taste the drink to make sure it was to my liking! With customer service like that, I'll sure to be back!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst DD on the west side. I was glad to see it was near my house but after visiting multiple times I cannot believe it is so bad. From consistently stale donuts, poor coffee, wrong orders, and very slow speed of service the only nice thing about this location is it seems to be clean. 

Pro tip: If you can make it to the location in sun city west, it's actually functioning like a DD should.

A sorry excuse for a DD franchise at this location."}
{"text":"The best donut shop in the area. 
This Dunkin' Donuts has fantastic service, good coffee and good food. What more can you ask for? Larry (the day manager) is quite the character and always manages to make me laugh. Everyone else is great and listens carefully to your order and then prepares it promptly for you. It's the perfect location for a parent to bring their kids for breakfast or just an afternoon treat."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I Run On Dunkin......but this location has gone WAY down hill.  I have been hitting this location for years for my morning coffee.  I have a refill cup, use the app, know the routine, I'm a Boston guy..it's in our blood.  We recently moved into the neighborhood so we are closer than ever and my wife and I loved this idea.  Well that was until recently when almost all of our orders have been wrong.  I can accept mistakes, we all make em and I'm not a review writer, until this past Saturday.  I pulled up to the drive thru with my usual order, \"refill cup, hot coffee with one pump of milk\".  I pull up, hand the girl working the drive thru window my cup, pay with the app and watch her take the lid off of an iced coffee and pour it into my cup.  Now like I said I get mistakes, no big deal, we all make em.   The issue I have I that I told her it was wrong, restated my order to her and she said she was sorry. Then she proceeded to take the iced coffee from my cup, pour it back into the previous to go cup (obviously for the car behind me) put the lid back on and stage it in the window for the next car!?!?!  That is straight cross contamination and a violation of health code!  She hands my refill cup to another person who fills it with my correct order, but as I found out down the road never bothered to rinse my cup, so not it tastes flavored because of the previous iced coffee....that's just lazy!  It's really disappointing that this location has gone so down hill, and I hope someone takes these posts seriously and makes a change soon."}
{"text":"2 stars because it's DD coffee and close to my home ... Other than that customer service is at the lowest at this place! Not sure what the employees care more for when they get there , the donuts or the donuts but the people that consume the donuts and the coffee ... If only they sold their syrups I would avoid this place like the bubonic plague !"}
{"text":"Feeling Ripped-Off.

I went through the drive-through this morning and ordered the #1 breakfast combo (2 donuts and a regular-size coffee)...supposed to be $3.39 according to the menu board.  I was charged $4.60.  I stewed over it all day...should have turned-around and went back to talk to the manager no matter how busy they were, but I was in a hurry and already late for work.

$4.60 is outrageous for two simple donuts and regular coffee, but even the advertised price of $3.39 plus tax seems high.  

With regard to the donuts; the Boston Creme didn't have much filling.  The French Crueller was top-notch, as was the coffee but not worth the price paid.  If I need a quick donut fix (not very often at all any more), I'll take my business to the local Circle K or grocery store...figure I can get the same effect with about $3.00 elsewhere."}
{"text":"Service is sometimes slow but that is during wry busy hours. Maybe the owners can hire a few more employees. Overall, great coffee and service!"}
{"text":"SLOW and tasted STALE! Not good for your chain Dunkin Donuts. :(  We got a dozen donuts and every one of them was hard. Insane."}

{"text":"Let me start off by saying I visit DD on almost a daily basis, it's definitely my first choice for when I need my coffee. I go to this location mainly because it is right in front of my neighborhood. Today I went through the drive through and there was nobody else in line. At the window this guy just says \"here\" and hands me my coffee. Kinda rude but it doesn't really phase me, just trying to get my caffeine. They forgot to give me a straw and seemed annoyed that I even asked for one. I was putting my debit card back in my wallet and putting the straw in my coffee while I was still parked, and the manager comes to the window and says \"so did you need anything else?\" Um no, I don't. Just trying to be responsible and put my stuff away so I don't have to do it when I'm driving. There was NOBODY in line. I don't know who the blonde woman is who runs this place but she is clearly miserable and it makes her customers uncomfortable. C'mon guys, don't make me find a new coffee place... one star only for the coffee."}
{"text":"Cant believe I haven't written a review for this spot!  This DD is located right down the road from my house.  It's my go to one, and for the most part it is always awesome!  Never been the biggest fan of their donuts themselves, but their muffins are great and their drinks are where its at!  My Summer obsession is their iced coffee.  Right now you can get a medium one for $1.50 or so.  Score!  Sign up for their Dunkin Donuts Perks and download the app....even more great deals on there!  You also get a free beverage (anything you want) for signing up.  Service is usually friendly and cheerful.  They have skipped out on giving me napkins a few times, and every now and then you get a worker that is semi pissy, but 90% of the time, it's usually a good experience.  I will continue to keep coming back!"}
{"text":"This Dunkin Donuts location is the best.  The girls during the day are great.  I left my phone on the counter by accident.

The girls made sure to put it in the back for me until I could get back to pick it up.  

Joyce on the night shift is a hoot. Joyce would be perfect for \"Undercover Boss\". Always smiling and caring about her job and customers.  

Joyce is always pleasant and willing to help. 
Besides she makes the best coffee in the valley.

I ordered a small vanilla coffee to which the curly headed guy behind the counter says \"You shouldn't do that, it's bad for the baby\" while also giving me an eye roll.

He was also very snarky. Wouldn't recommend to a friend. Teach old man manners and I will come back. In addition, the drive thru takes far too long and I miss my green tea. I always got a medium green tea and I egg and cheese on a croissant. I miss my green tea. The man who took my order missed a couple items, however a nice lady corrected it and gave me what I ordered.

At this point sorry to say I lost it was told they were not makingAnymore donuts IT WAS 9AM!! pointed out that the name on their storefront says Duncan Donuts not Starbucks and that should be their priority not fancy Lattes ,sandwiches.
And believe me we've lived in the arrowhead area since 94\" and it wasnt always this bad!!"}

{"text":"I usually go thru the drive thru here but sometimes I go inside.  The inside is very clean and inviting.  Today I went through the drive thru for a quick donut.  As usual, the service was friendly and quick. I always receive consistently good food and good service here."}
{"text":"Got to be the worst DD in America! One slow cashier and very limited product at 9:11 on Saturday morning. Same thing yesterday! Franchise owners-are you listening?"}
{"text":"My advice.  Dont stop keep driving to the other Dunkin in town.  They never get the orders correct, and pretty sure they forget my turbo shot consistantly.  This is the only Dunkin my Coldbrew comes out light brown.   The staff will ignore you unless you speak up.  I actually altered my daily commute so I go past a different location."}
{"text":"We so looked forward to visiting here as we used to live in the Boston area and no longer have access to DD living now in Washington State.  The donuts had no frosting on them.  We got about 6 different varieties to complete the dozen and they were all lacking.  This store is not representing the DD brand well, especially if you've grown up with them in Mass.  There are enough snowbirds and relocaters in AZ now from back east that they will know the difference.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Always a great experience, fast and delicious. It's our routine to grab breakfast for our whole family every weekend. Love their iced coffee with mocha!"}
{"text":"Prices here a cheaper all through the menu compared to another store I frequent. And the people are mostly nice here. :)"}
{"text":"I was really excited to have a coffee shop be introduced to my neighborhood. 
Unfortunately, this one has been a let down so far. 
First, the pros: very clean interior and exterior. The coffee is good, and donuts fresh (as expected).
Cons: the staff do not seem to know what they are doing, or even like each other. 
I'm used to coffee shops having friendly, upbeat staff, and the multiple employees that have met me at the register here look barely awake, and even a bit overwhelmed. I do not think the fact that it's newly opened to be any excuse for poor staffing. 
Most importantly, out of 4 times visited, 2 times I've left angry. The first time, a Sunday morning, i stood in line for 15 minutes only to be told as soon as it was my turn that they were only taking cash!! No explanation as to why, just saying \"it just happened\"?????
I came back this morning, was the only one inside the shop, and ordered my iced coffee. 
I stood waiting for it for 5 minutes and was only noticed bc a girl that came in behind me got her drink first. 
I guess im just used to more efficiently run places, like Starbucks."}
{"text":"Located on 67th avenue, east side of the road, just north of the 101 in a little strip mall.  Weekdays outside of prime breakfast hours are great at this place - no long lines, pleasant employees, etc.  Rush hour and weekend mornings can bring the longer lines, especially for those people who order the egg sandwiches and such.  

Much nicer after the remodeling."}
{"text":"Little slow going through the drive-thru, then was able to see teens goofing around inside as I waited for my order.  I can understand a wait for the egg based sandwiches, but donuts & coffee should be in and out fast."}
{"text":"This is a really convenient stop for coffee and a donut. I often drive through. The service is always good."}
{"text":"This location ALWAYS delivers on quality iced/hot coffee and iced tea. They are very friendly and have wonderful customer service. I always leave there smiling! Plus their speed of service is always impressive."}
{"text":"Today's experience was great.  If you are looking for a great Christmas flavor I've fallen in love with the sugar cookie latte. Also,  if you have not already done so I highly suggest downloading the dunkin donuts app. You'll have access to coupons there.  Right now they are doing a promo where you get a free coffee on Mondays if the Cardinals win.  Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Dunkin Donuts iced coffee is cheap and rad. This location is convenient and is hardly ever busy."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get 4 dozen donut holes for a meeting. I was the only customer there. There were three employees and the girl helping me had to plead with the other two to please help her. After some negotiation one girl decided to step in to help her. They all acted like if it wasn't for the damn customers we have a great job. My God, are you doing serving coffee and donuts.
I was very disappointed on my first visit. However, the store was clean."}
{"text":"Dude, this alleged 24 hour Dunkin' Donuts DOESN'T SELL DONUTS late nights!  Is it awesome to be really drunk in the middle of the night on saturday and go to get some donuts at the 24 hour dunkin' donuts, and it's OPEN but they DON'T HAVE DONUTS?  NO!!!!

The drive through is hella fast on weekday mornings, and the donuts are all always exactly like you'd expect from a dunkin' donuts (when they actually sell them.)"}
