{"text":"Note: This review was written before the restaurant changed owners. I've not had a chance to go back, so I can't speak to how things are now.  This place serves a little bit of everything: mexican food, mediterranean, greek, american -- but none of it well.  Went there yesterday for lunch with colleagues, largely because our first choice was full to the gills with out-of-towners who came for the high school basketball tournament.  I had a falafel sandwich with fries.  The sandwich was cold and clearly intended to be served that way and one of the fries was still frozen at one end. The sandwich was bland, fell apart easily because the pita was stiff and cold -- and let's face it: cold falafel just sucks.  Another had a chicken quesadilla, which he reported to be ok but very bland. And the third had a gyro, which was as greasy and nasty as they come, also with fries.  This is the third restaurant in this location in the last several years, and it's pretty clear that it's not going to be the last.  Oh, and another thing.  If your a slightly plump young woman working behind the counter, perhaps it would be better if you wore slightly better fitting jeans so that we don't have to see your ass and your thong creeping up it when we order.  Just a thought."}
{"text":"I believe they have recently switched owners and I just tried it out within the last month so I'm assuming that they are much more improved now because I love it.  I usually get the double cheese burger because the first time I had it, I was hooked.  I hope to try some of their other dishes but the double burger is just too darn tempting!   The owner is very nice and the service is good and the time it took to get our food was quite fast.   I crave Palis Cafe.... yyuummm... some would be good RIGHT NOW!"}
{"text":"I was excited when a new restaurant came to the corner of Orchard and Regent, but my excitement was short-lived after eating there a few times.  On my first visit, I orderedsomething off the overhead menu and was told the price was actually higher than listed there.  Ooookay.    On my second visit, the cashier constantly swore at the new cash register as she battled to make it work.  I tried a different dish on three visits, and each tasted like the last.  Which is to say it had no flavor at all.   Have these people never heard of seasonings?  And lamb is so easy to good and so tasty, yet they somehow managed to cook all the flavor out of the meat.  I have been warning friends to stay away, and now you've been warned too."}
