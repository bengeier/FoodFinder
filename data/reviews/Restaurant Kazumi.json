{"text":"Went there for the first time last night and I really enjoyed it.  We ordered different kind of sushi and they're all delicious and fresh.  Our waiters were very kind and helped us with the choices and we were very pleased.  The wait was long but at the end it worth it. I'll go back for sure."}
{"text":"J'y suis allé pour le lunch.. Petit menu limité mais je ne suis pas déçu de mon choix.. Les sushis du chef, c'était très bon et surtout bien frais.
Le dessert avec le chocolat frit est malade!! Je le recommande"}
{"text":"Small but good Sushi restaurant. I had the \"Fantasi\" 8 pcs with raw Tuna on top. Very good and different since it has no seaweed paper.   They also of course have a regular Sushi and Sashimi menu where you can choose \"a la carte\".

I also took the Shrimp tempura.  The tempura appetizer was excellent, batter was light and crispy, not over cooked or mushy like some places.

If you are over 6 people, it might be tough to get a seat as the restaurant isn't that large. The restaurant is only 2 blocks from Langelier metro station, parking lot is crowded because of Jean Coutu, but I've seen way smaller than this."}
{"text":"The best Sushi that I have ever had. Try the Chef Menu. It is amazing, each dish is different and awesome. The fish is so fresh.

Don't forget to bring your wine. There is a SAQ just beside."}
{"text":"Wow GREAT sushi place. Came to that place couple of times already. For the prices you pay you get awesome food and great service. Recommend to reserve in advance as this place was packed. I had to wait and even then only place available was at the bar. Definitely recommended place."}
{"text":"Comme restaurant de sushis, c'est bien. J'ai seulement pris un plat de sashimi pour emporter et contrairement à des restaurants de bas de gamme, ils n'ont pas mis de goberge et de tamago (omelette). J'ai goûté à de bons tamago au Japon mais à Montréal, c'est souvent une omelette normale fade. 

Le Resto, comme au Japon, nous donne du riz avec les sashimi. 

Les poissons étaient frais, mais c'est certain que ce n'est pas aussi variés que les restaurants haute gamme (park, shinji, juni). Le prix est alors conséquent et très abordable. 

Content d'avoir ce restaurant dans l'est.

J'y retournerai sur place pour manger autres choses."}
{"text":"Best sushi place in Montreal let's just say I'm there every week. So fresh and tasty. You gonna love the fruit ones and the crab ones. My only complaint is the parking in the mall wakos in that parking. Oh BTW bring ur own wine so you could get smashed too!!  Wow what a place wish I owned it cause its really doing well!!"}
{"text":"Very good. The presentation of food is excellent, although in my preference I like to taste less the sauce and more the seafood. I love the scallop even if it's around $20 each. Very satisfied, service is excellent; the waiter present each of your food in a very professional aka fancy-like. Also major key is that you can bring your own wine!!"}
{"text":"Pros : excellente bouffe et service en salle à manger

Cons : j'ai appellé une fois pour commander et passer chercher ma commande. 1 heure plus tard. Après 35 minutes d'attente dans leur entrée, ils se rendent compte qu'il n'ont toujours pas commencé la mienne. Mais comme d'habitude, c'était délicieux."}
{"text":"2 stars is pretty generous. Food is not bad I've had better. Definitely not worth the 3.5 hour wait. We only order 40 pieces!!. It took 2 hours to get the second dish!! As I'm writing this review, I'm still waiting for my last dish. I am no longer hungry. Just annoyed."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD, AMAZING SERVICE 

Although expensive, Kazumi is all around great. We had 6 plates from the chef's recommendation; the portions were small, but the quality was amazing. The presentation was very unique, candles in my food, various foods in wine glasses which were held to the plate with wasabi. How it looked really lived up to it's taste. The dessert was to DIE-FOR! It was so amazing, and I am very picky about my desserts. We had banana with a sauce and peanuts which does not sound appetizing but was just great, a green tea crème brûlée which was a bit too bitter, and a vanilla icecream with small waffles with a chocolate filling which was ABSOLUTELY delicious! (I am drooling as I write this review.)

The setting is modern and dark. With candles on your table, really gives off a rather intimate vibe!

The staff were patient, informative, attentive, and very sweet. 

5 stars for me- it would be truly 5 stars if it weren't for the long waits for your food to get delivered. But if you're willing to spend extra money, Kazumi would be my top recommendation!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Kazumi! I've been going since they first opened. Let me tell you that they are always consistent and food NEVER disappoints. 

The food is always fresh and tastes so good. You have to try all the specialties on their menu! Everything is so exquisite. I love their salmon tartare, it's to die for and no other restaurant beats Kazumi for their tartare!!! They have fresh unis from time to time and they're super huge! 

This place gets crowded very fast, i suggest you reserve a few days in advanced to avoid disappointment. Do not come to eat here if you are in a rush. They take their sweet time to make sure everything is perfect. 

Do not forget to BYOB! There's an SAQ right next to the resto, which is pretty convenient! Try the \"mille feuille glacé & ecstase au chocolat\" for desert! Mouth watering!!!"}
{"text":"Decent, bit far from the best sushi in MTL. A bit overpriced for the level of quality you get, and also quite noisy."}
{"text":"Nous y sommes allés à quelques reprise et nous ne sommes jamais déçus. Tout est frais et gouteux. Très bon rapport qualité-prix."}
{"text":"So far the best sushi I've had the honour of eating here in Montreal.
Rolled well and with great flavours.
My tuna steak was also good (and gone within 0.10sec).

Prices are very reasonable, 2 people $65 (tip excluded), and we ate a lot: gyoza, 3 rolls, 2 ebi, 2 ama ebi, and the tuna steak.

The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because of the really long wait in between dishes. 
If you're in a hurry: don't go here, but if you want a nice long evening out with some amazing sushi: do go here.

And bring some wine -wink wink-"}
{"text":"After reading all if the reviews I had high hopes for this place, and they didn't disappoint. We started with a house salad and Miso soup accompanied by the Spicy octopus salad. These 3 dishes were honestly under-whelming. The Miso soup was plain and uninspired as were both salads. Once this course was over everything got much better. The Salmon Tartar was fantastic...spicy and rich with great textures served with rice cakes. This was followed by an assortment of sashimi and rolls that are the basics that you would expect from a high end sushi restaurant. The final course had 2 specialty rolls including a lobster roll and a strawberry-scallop-shrimp roll. The 2nd roll was exceptional in its sweet mixture of flavours. All in all well worth the time and money."}
{"text":"So I called for reservations for a Friday night, all was confirmed but once I got there the table wasn't ready. Host says how its gonna be 10-15 mins, which is normal considering it was a packed house. 30 mins later and still no table, at this point the host didn't seem to know what he was doing, tables were freeing up but I was never called to be seated. After 45 mins of waiting I had enough, told the host we were leaving and the wait was ridiculous considering we had reserved a table. Basically he didn't seem to care and just let us go...bottom line don't go there...they don't know how to hold a reservation and service from the host was non existent."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with excellent sushi choices. The bonus is it's BYOB!! We had the tasting menu and we were not disappointed. We enjoyed a soup, salad and sushi. Let the chef decide what you eat and he will make you something out of his freshest ingredients! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing place if you want to try fresh and original sushi. They also make different meals with fish of the day, sea food, etc. The presentation of the food is incredible, the staff is also really nice. This place is worth the price!"}
{"text":"Good food but poor customer service. I called twice on a Friday to order take out and I was place on hold and then disconnected . When I called back was placed on hold again then nobody came on the line . I finally hung up called back and got voicemail. I could never place an order. Had dinner there as well and service is very long . It is very loud and pricey for quality . Will never go there again ."}
{"text":"Très bonne place pour essayer différentes délicatesse. Il en a pour tout les budgets. Bien hâte dit retourner pour faire le tour du menu. Très bon service, j'ai même discuter avec le chef des provenances des différents aliments (très agréable). Je recommande a tous."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi restaurant.  Let's start:

The decor and ambience is great for either dates and group gatherings.

The service is very friendly and the owner is a pleasure to meet.

As for the food, you have to try it for yourself. Go for the speciality sushis and I always go for my standard tuna and salmon makis.

A big plus: it's bring your own wine and the a SAQ (liquor store) right next door. Convenient and well located.

Must try."}
{"text":"Un de mes restaurants préférés, les sushis sont excellents comme la majorité du menu. C'est un super endroit pour aller en date la fin de semaine, très bonne ambiance avec peu de lumière et de la musique sans oubliez que c'est un apportez votre vin ce qui est génial. En plus d'être situé juste à côté d'une saq express, donc quoi plus? Sans oublier que le service est impeccable, juste un petit conseil réserver de l'avance, car  c'est toujours très occupé. Prix totalement abordable pour la qualité du menu en plus d'être un apportez votre vin!"}
{"text":"Leurs sushis spéciaux sont chers mais sont les meilleurs sushis que j'ai mangé de ma vie. Leurs sushis plutôt ordinaires (californiens, kamikazes, tempura makis, etc.) sont corrects.. ils sont bons mais goutent pas assez ! Je préfère ceux des autres restaurants de sushis où j'ai mangé. La salle est petite et TRÈS bruyante. Les gens parlent tellement fort et rient extrêmement fort ce que je trouve assez irrespectueux, mais ce n'est pas la faute du restaurant. Le prix est un peu cher mais pour les sushis spéciaux, ça vaut vraiment le prix. Très bien situé ! Facile de se rendre et de se stationner. J'aurais aimé un peu plus de variété dans le menu par contre. Bon staff!! :)"}
{"text":"Super bon service! Bouffe parfois inégale, mais vaut définitivement la peine d'y tenter sa chance!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi restaurants in Montreal! The best part is that it's a byow.

Service is friendly and the good is delicious. The only thing is that food might come out pretty slow. Not good for you if you are starving, in a hurry to eat or time limited. A meal typically takes at least 2 hours there."}
{"text":"It was my first time and I love the vibe of Kazumi sushi lounge. To hangout with your friend or other its nice. You.can bring your alcohol the SAQ just beside. You have so many choice and option of eating combo or no you found what you can pay for it. Better if you reserved first because its always full..."}
{"text":"Belle découverte que ce resto de sushi ou l'on peut apporter son vin. 

Superbe présentation des plats, très bonne qualité des poisson et surtout bonne grosseur des morceaux de sashimi.  Les puristes trouveront sûrement qu'il y a trop trop de leur spécialités avec de la sauce mais certains dont celui avec le thon rouge, champignons shiitake et tobico valent vraiment la peine.
Nous avions simplement demander au serveur de dire au chef de nous impressionner et ça été chose faite.
Ne faites pas comme nous et réservez avant de vous présenter car c'est probablement le resto de l'heure dans l'est de Montreal présentement...

La seule ombre au tableau??? Ne soyez pas pressés car l'attente entre les services est vraiment longue ce qui rend le souper assez long...par chance, on avait emmener beaucoup de vino pour passer le temps..;-)"}
{"text":"My favourite to-go sushi place in Montreal!! 

The owner Thang D. is really sweet and welcoming. 

The waiters give a really good service. 
We put down our glass of water and someone is already there pouring in some more water!!

I went here with a group of 18 people on September 24th 2016, and we all got served and left within 3 hours to go on our karaoke night. 

I highly recommend the lobster roll again, it's really my favourite. Since it was birthday, I took the liberty to choose the chef suggestions (I can't tell you which rolls I had, but I have pictures of a few). 

Again, the BYOW with the SAQ that is 30 seconds walking distance is really a + !! 
And I love their chocolate/Nutella fried bites with the ice cream, it's really amazing.
They mad me a Bday greeting on my desert (offered by the restaurant).

I recommend to reserve for Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays !! It gets busy really quickly.

*** I forgot to mention!! I saw Veronique Cloutier and her husband as well as her sister and her husband here last year! Hehe"}
{"text":"Kazumi est un très bon resto japonais situé dans un coin plutôt fade de la rue Sherbrooke Est. Le midi, le menu est très abordable et propose une série de plats japonais et de combinaisons intéressantes de sushi, sashimi et maki. Le décor de l'endroit est chic, les tables et banquettes sont confortables. Le resto est d'une propreté sans reproche. Je vous conseil le spécial sushi et sashimi ou encore le saumon teriyaki sur un lit de légumes sautés. Un délice japonais authentique. À la fin du repas, le thé est servi dans une charmante petite bouilloire en céramique avec des petits gobelets traditionnels. 

J'enlève une étoile car le service est un peu lent et les jeunes serveurs manquent parfois d'expérience. La carte des vins est correcte sans être exceptionnel. 

Je recommande si vous cherchez un bon resto japonais près du métro Langelier."}
{"text":"This is a great little sushi place in the east end.  Tucked away in a strip mall the sushi here is delicious.  I had the Kazumi II option which gives you a chance to try a little bit of everything.  The soup was a miso broth loaded with different kinds of seafood like shrimps and scallops and was excellent.  There was also chicken teriyaki and sushi both of which were outstanding.

The service isn't the greatest and hence why I docked the star.  The last time I went they forgot to bring stuff we'd ordered and overall they were a little on the slow side.  It is still worth the visit.  Be sure to make reservations though as it can be quite crowded especially on a weekend.  also note that it's a BYOB.  If you forget to bring wine there is a SAQ Express right next to it."}
{"text":"Went with a big group for a birthday party. Most of the group had a special chefs menu, I went a la carte as I'm majorly pregnant. I ordered a sushi roll off the chefs specialties list, seaweed salad, soba noodle with black cod and the tempura dessert. I should mention that this is a byow joint and a few doors down is an saq. Awesome... If I weren't pregnant :) I loved my soba noodles with black cod. The fish is fresh, perfectly cooked and melts in your mouth. I forget the name of my sushi roll but it was the only one with grilled eel and no raw fish. They weren't stingy on the eel. It was lovely on eyes and on my taste buds. My seaweed salad had some caviar, that's probably a no-no for me but I love seaweed salad and this one didn't disappoint! Last but definitely not least was my super delicious tempura dessert, hazelnut chocolate tempura with fruits and vanilla ice cream. The ice cream and fruit balanced out the richness from the tempura. The resto is definitely pricier then the usual kanda/all you can eat sushi joint but I can see why. The dishes are fresh, immaculately made and presented. Would go again for a special occasion. Especially when I can take advantage of the saq next door.

The place was packed the whole night. I think reservations would be in order."}
{"text":"I was agreeably surprised by this restaurant and happy to find this rare gem in a neighborhood that doesn't have that many good dinner spots. 

Nice decor, fun ambiance, BYOB, good service and excellent food! What else could I ask? Moreover, for the quality of food that you get and the fact that you can bring your own wine, the prices are extremely reasonable. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome; fresh, delicious, and artfully displayed. However, the service is slow and erratic. Avoid Saturday nights and big groups (I did both). Also, parking is difficult."}
{"text":"Ordered the miso soup, chef special salad, heritage, fruita, and fantacy soya paper rolls.The salad is pretty refreshing, nice, and the miso soup is creative and good too. The heritage roll is pretty good and creative, but the other two are kind of disappointing, not recommended at all. The environment is pretty nice and the waiter is very nice too. Everyone speaks French as the first language, but they understand English as well."}
{"text":"Great place original sushi
Dishes are beautiful to see .... lots of work and effort put in to it .!!!
Being an BYOW ... makes it an ever better place .!!!
Its definitely one of the best sushis i have ever tried .!!!!
Service is great and the stuff very friendly .!!!
Definitely worth the price"}
