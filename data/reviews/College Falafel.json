{"text":"Nicely flavoured falafel and an excellent chicken shwarma!"}
{"text":"Healthy home made food made with love.  I used to eat there twice a week, but I moved away, so now I only get to eat there once a month.  My favorite is the Chicken Schwarma dinner.  I have to travel a lot for my job, and this is probably my favorite meal food in all of Canada, comparable to Yarmouth Lobster or Vancouver Sushi. It's freaking goood"}
{"text":"Amazing fresh ingredients.  Everything is made from scratch. Wonderful fast and friendly service.  You've got to try the stuffed eggplant.  GOT TO."}
{"text":"Went to try the shawarma the other night, and was less than impressed. Curried rice also struck me as a bit odd. Originally from Thornhill, I can say it's very easy to find multiple options for superior shawarma 30 minutes north of this place. Have not tried anything else on the menu: this is a review of the shawarma dinner only."}
{"text":"the food is really fresh and delicious / mostly prepared right in front if you ... Lots of options! And don't miss the samosas"}
{"text":"1.40am, Feb.14.2015:
 I jumped out a cab, ready to roll.
 jumped in a cab earlier, as it was about time I eat for once.

-***i decided \"Shwarma\" for the 1400th time since being in this city.
For those that are late-night types like me... you'll see that even though you live downtown there really isn't that much to check out. I'm glad that I made it here.

College Falafel:
This place hit the spot.

The owner didn't mind my hyperactivity nor my nonchalant \"eccentricity\" either. 

Food: I ate the Donair. Had some extra meat, as I usually request. 
It was pretty good. I was happy. Nice sweet sauce, yogurt, and fresh vegetables. + I got a nice spinach pie (like spanikopita). 

-Very good food. Looks clean. Not too expensive (comparable). Better food
than a high percentage of places I've been too. Better than 

-In a city where [Delivery joints], \"Open-now\" don't deliver and are not open, 
[this place DELIVERED!] in terms of good taste, good portions, and a nice staff.

I will be back. You don't mess with Good Food. Especially when the Owner, looks like a younger, taller, more capable Robert De Niro

-Verdict: 4.5 Stars. Nice Owner.  Excellent food. Comparable cost. Will return when I am in the mood for some nice Donair or Shwarmera."}
{"text":"Best shawarma in Toronto hands down. My friendly neighbours are lovely and the food tastes great.  I've cheated on them and went to a few shawarma places close by but none of them compared!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for close to 10 years and I haven't been able to find a better place in all that time. So fresh, so filling and the owners are so friendly!
If you are in the area and hungry do yourself a favour and come here. Everything is great!!!!"}
{"text":"Be careful here. The food was prepared without gloves and did not look that fresh. And while it gave me pause while I was there, I was starving so went ahead and ate my shawarma. Mildly sick for a few days after - and not that tasty either."}
{"text":"Had the donair, it was pricey at 8$ and small. But it tasted great!  Also had a root beer it was over 3$ .
Overall the place is small and expensive but if I am in the area I would eat there just for the Donair."}
{"text":"Best middle eastern food I've ever had outside of the middle east. I've been on a hunt for good middle eastern food in Toronto for a while, but have always come short. 

College Falafel has a friendly family feel to it. The falafel is made fresh on the spot for you. The shawarma is actually cut when you order so it's not dry from sitting in a heated metal container. 

If you still have some room after your meal - go for a rose water baklava they are delicious!"}
{"text":"Falafel was good. Donair wasn't quite authentic.  Also twice the cost of similar restaurants -- so this isn't a \"cheap\" option."}
{"text":"I stopped in here late night on an impulse, and was rewarded for my efforts. I had a falafel pita and a finger baklava.

The falafel was delicious, crispy-crunchy outside with soft moist interior. I'm not an expert on falafel, and I don't know what makes one \"authentic\", but the one I had here was definitely something to write home about. Good pita too, moist, not tough, but didn't tear while I was holding it.

The baklava was nice too, extremely soft, dripping with sugar, with a generous hint of rosewater. They use cinnamon, which I usually don't like (it tends to overpower all other flavours), but here it was light enough to be pleasant. 

I'm looking forward to going back to try the shawarma, or just to get another falafel."}
{"text":"I love the falafel, but the roasted eggplant wrap is the real vegetarian gem. It's a wrap stuffed with soft, warm, slow-roasted carmelized eggplant, hummus, tabouleh, tzatziki, lettuce, red onion and tomatoes.  

 In addition to the veggie sandwich and falafel wraps, they have a variety of veggie side dishes: tabouleh salad, chickpea salad, veggie samosas, grape leaves, stuffed eggplant, potatoes, and a lots of sweets: rice pudding, almond cookies, baklava."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places.  Best chicken shawarma sandwich around.  

Yes, yes, I know the place itself is nothing fancy, but the food is unbeatable, the people who run it are friendly and, as someone else noted, they expanded a bit so you can sit down inside and enjoy your food now.

I've spoken to the gentleman who works there a couple of times and they really strike me as decent, hardworking people.

Did I mention they make a great chicken shawarma sandwich?"}
{"text":"OVERPRICED!

decent falafel place, but I dont know how they can justify the prices.  MANY cheaper and better falafel/shwarma places around Toronto.  

I paid $12.00 for a chicken shwarma plate... way to expensive. I wont be back unless that price drops significantly."}
{"text":"I know what you're thinking: \"5-stars? He must be the owner's brother's cousin or something.\"  Well, actually no.  I'm just a guy who walked into the right place at the right time, and my stomach hasn't stopped bragging about the food ever since!
You can't go wrong with anything you order, so go ahead and feel free to experiment. I live in the neighborhood, so I've been lucky enough to bring home their stuffed peppers (incredible!); their samosas are phenomenal--in fact I've hosted a few benders where I've bought like 40 samosas for food or whatever, and everyone ends up complimenting them!!
The look and feel of the restaurant is an ongoing evolution, and I'm not sure they quite have it right, yet. But you're not there for the ambience, and you can't eat critiques on decor. However, you can rest assured that at any time, and on any day, you will find some of the best family-prepared, recipes-of-tastiness on the planet!!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to having a falafel from here because of the reviews. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. I ordered 3 falafels, a cheese pie and French fries for take out. I also asked for garlic sauce with the fries. I was informed they were out of the garlic sauce (disappointment #1). But not to worry because their fries were so great on their own they didn't need anything. The man fresh cut the fries and popped them into the fryer. My order was ready and I went home exited to eat. 
After getting home I emptied the take out container of fries onto a plate and was sad to see that not all the potato was fried/cooked (see pic). The fries were also terribly greasy. Disappointment #2. 
My friend took a bite out of the cheese pie and proceeded to spit it out almost immediately. Disappointment #3. The oil that the pie was made with and/or the cheese was rancid. Gross!  
Now onto the falafel. It was just ok  a little dry. Not enough sauce. The hot sauce was not hot. Or maybe they forgot to add it?!
Overall, this place did not live up to the reviews. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Love it sooooo good! The chicken shawarma is amazing and the rice pudding is the best I've ever had"}
{"text":"Okay, firstly this the best Mediterranean restaurant you'll find for miles! I've tried out many shawarma joints on days I need to satisfy that craving for a nice wrap, no place does it like CF. Secondly the people serving there are extremely warm, very welcoming and very generous with their portions (I often get to enjoy my leftovers for lunch the next day too, although I would recommend eating the food fresh and hot, it just tastes so much better). Lastly, they seem to be open all hours of the day! 
 
I'm making my turns to try every single item on their menu, for now I am in love with their donair, chicken shawarma, falafels (they were nice enough to let me try all the different ones they had available) the rice pudding, the baklava, and their chicken samosas. Needless to say, I've become a shameless regular at this restaurant. All the good taste but still being healthy."}
{"text":"I went here the other day for my usual Donair and as usual it tasted amazing; reminded me of home (Halifax). This time however I decided to treat myself to a little baklava and it was amazing. I've had baklava before, but nothing compares to this. This baklava was angelic!
Oh and the Donair was amazing too."}
{"text":"I work very close to this place and I always get my lunch here. I feel I have to write a review because I have yet to find shawarma or falafel that tastes as good as theirs!

I usually get the shawarma or the falafel and they are both amazing...the marinating makes them really good. What I also really like and which make them unique are the topings especially the really good pickled red cabbage and of course the Tahini sauce. The falafel is also cooked on the spot and it tastes so fresh as opposed to other places.

Also, they are not cheap on the amount of meat or toppings they put. That really annoys me in some places...where I have seen them measure things.

I actually crave their shawarma and falafel when I am off work (I'm a teacher).

I always get soo disappointed when I go to other shawarma places because they are so bad and dirty.

This place is definately clean and there are all homemade and nongreasy healthy meals...

I also get their baklava a lot...really like it.

I highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE College Falafel!  Although I've moved out of the neighbourhood, sometimes I'll find detours to drive by it just so i have an excuse to get a Halifax-style donair (btw, the donairs in Halifax aren't as good as these ones!).  The owners are a lovely couple who work so hard and their food is a testament to that!  It's all made in-house.  The almond cookies and the baklava are also delicious. BEST donairs in the GTA, bar none."}
{"text":"Tried a great new sandwich. The Falafel with Donair sauce. Donair gets capitalized because it's that good. 

Always grab a chicken or veg samosa to munch while I'm waiting for the sandwich (3 minutes is a struggle when I'm hungry). 

Also: Rice pudding. Decadent."}
{"text":"Yes, very friendly owners, but the falafel ordered didn't live up to the hype. Perhaps it's my own preference, but I found it to be soft/soggy in the inside. I like my falafels a little on the crispier side. Will go back to try the eggplant dish."}
{"text":"I have been here many times since I share the same background as the owners. I have had the chicken shawarma, donairs, salads and desserts and they are all phenomenal. 

Food is made fresh to order, prices are definitely fair for the amount of food you are receiving and of course they are open late for people that enjoy a decent meal into the late night. 

Give it a try you will be pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Read many reviews that it's one of he best in Toronto. I appreciate that each order is made fresh form a small fryer and hope they were being true when they say they change the oil often. They didn't have some of the typical falafel toppings I enjoy most. The falafel was good, but not spectacular. Would go again, but not as a destination."}
{"text":"Not the best schwarma I've ever had but not the worst.  I enjoyed the chicken schwarma platter, good portion sizes and the food tasted good."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food and friendly service. It was not nearly as spicy as I would have liked, so will ask for more sauce next time. I recommend the chicken shawarma."}
{"text":"Delicious food, healthy and tasty. The owners are very sweet and work very hard. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is they have raised their prices, and a $14 souvlaki plate is no longer an affordable option for me. Great food!!"}
{"text":"As someone who has tried schwarma from across the city and the world I am always on the look out for a new fix.  

College falafel is more expensive than most but lays claim to the best in the city.  I have tried the chicken Schwarma and the donair and both are impeccable.  They are so fresh and flavourful.  The added benefit how kind and friendly the owners are.  

I Will be making the trip here more frequently and worth traveling to anywhere in GTA."}
{"text":"Decent chicken shawarma, nothing special. Ingredients do seem to be fresh but I've had better elsewhere. Overall taste was a bit bland, very healthy tasting. I prefer stronger flavours so I won't be returning."}
{"text":"ice owners, good food. Owners very nice and friendly. I tried several items and will add my review based on each:
- chicken shawarma: below average. The chicken was dry and over cooked. Maybe it was a one time off. 
- beef shawarma: was good but I still prefer the Paramount beef 
- Halifax donair: this is my favourite sandwich if you know anything about donair from Halifax you'll know this is NOTHING like it. Halifax donair is simply the besting while this one is different it is still great. 
- falafel sandwich: was actually disappointed with it given the name of the place and all the positive reviews. Again maybe it was a one off but after my first try doubt will have the falafel there again
- Lentil soup: fantastic
- baklava: Good but certainly not Arabic or Turkish like."}
{"text":"I'm downgrading my rating of this place. I'm nursing an upset stomach after eating an expensive donair. They keep raising their prices while the quality goes down."}
{"text":"Very good, simple, home cooked style food.  Falafel sand which ftw!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and small portions. Food is pretty good. Not good for large takeout orders though. Staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Thank you for the large amounts of food and friendly service! Perfect dinner spot, have to try it."}
{"text":"Really good Maritime style Donair that according to the staff, is famous around the country. Was nice and quick with some pickled sides that you wouldn't see on a Donair in Halifax. However, it had the good part of Yum and was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I haven't heard the word donair in years since I was out east for school. I was pleasantly surprised to see them offered here as well as multiple combo items for very fair prices. They Do have seating but id recommend them more for a grab and go or quick bite. The people who run this location are very kind, salt to the earth, friendly people. Great location just south of ossington subway along college street car line, you'd be a a fool not to try it atleast once. My advise is load up on the donair sauce it's what's makes a good donair fantastic. It may appear sketchy but trust me it's incredible. Will return."}
{"text":"Both the meal as a whole AND all of its component parts were Unbelievably Delicious.

Best falafel plate in the city? Or (dramatic pause) Best Falafel Plate Ever?!"}
{"text":"This place really does have the best falafel I've ever had.  It wasn;t the usual dry, gritty falafel you get in so many places.  Delicious garlic sauce, and the pita was sooo fresh and moist.  I also got the amazing baklava.  It was not a hit with everyone at our table....but I'd consider a trip here JUST to get more!!!

Awesome!"}
{"text":"Yuck weird, it's not common falafel, it almost tastes Indian or something. The rice is so weird. If you're expecting a place like Mersin, this isn't it, it might not be bad but it isn't a standard shwarma spot and I found the food gross."}
{"text":"This place is delicious.  What a perfect Falafel.  Split just the standard falafel fully loaded.  The care in making it was very evident.  Everything was placed so great and perfect.  Great experience - also found out that they can split the regular one into two - which is a handy tip.  The chairs look very new (and are comfy) - everything was clean and the lady was so nice! 

Great go to falafel!"}
{"text":"Fantastic kebob, made just how like it!

I eat here regularly. It's fantastic in a pinch and always satisfies me. 

So many places to choose from in this neighbourhood, College Falafel serves up a tremendous kebab - no sauce for me, just the flavour of the meat!

Wonderful... and the owners are fantastically friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious food, fresh and healthy, meticulously prepared, and lots of options! In an area with so many chain fast-food restaurants, this is a refreshing option that feels like a small family-owned restaurant. Can't wait to come back and try more things from the menu. Five stars!"}
{"text":"This is the best shwarma joint in Toronto. Everything is made from scratch! Very healthy and tasty."}
{"text":"AWFUL BLAND FALAFEL. 

Zero flavour garlic sauce and the tahini sauce was excessively watered down. 

Don't waste your money unless you have no standards for falafel or you're too wasted to tell the difference."}
{"text":"Oh so filling veggie options! Ever had their vegetarian \"sandwich?\" It is a stuffed eggplant on a whole wheat pita with all the trimmings for just six bucks incl. tax. 

I love eggplant so I found this dish very satisfying. Friendly little joint, this is. 
It always smells of cinnamon because whenever I come in,  they're always sprinkling cinnamon on the fresh new bowls of rice pudding."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, but dried out chicken and falafel. Prices too expensive for such dried out old food. Never returned again."}
{"text":"I've been kind of hard on Toronto about the poor Middle-Eastern food since moving from Montreal and I was afraid I'd have to go back to Boustan if I ever had a craving for shawarma. No need to travel for 6 hours when College Falafel is here!

This place is fantastic. They make the falafel fresh when you order (deep-fry it right in front of you to your liking!). The shawarma is cut fresh from the spit and then fried up a bit to make it even juicier...both are huge! 

As an added bonus, this place also has the best baklava I've ever had and pretty damn good Turkish coffee to boot! Go here and try it out...Anyone who thinks Ghazale is actually good will not go back there after trying *real* Middle Eastern food!"}
{"text":"I've ended up here a few times... Everytime after a few drinks admittedly.

Whether indulging in a chicken shawarma or beef donair, this place has hit the spot quite well every time. The chicken samosas on the other hand, being a mix of potato and chicken with a curry blend, I would imagine are good fresh, but at the end of the night after sitting in a refrigerator for a few hours, are a pass.

One thing worth mentioning that I find neat about this place, is the many hand written testimonials of how good their East Coast Donair is. Apparently, according to many, this place make the best ones outside of the actual East Coast. Food for thought, thats for sure. Unfortunately my drunken encounters and lack of east coast experience limits me from making that judgement. Either way, its still tasty food."}
{"text":"Freshest falafel ever!!! So good and fressshhhh. They can be slow at times is the only thing but their friendliness makes up for the slowness."}
{"text":"I wanted something Middle Eastern and was getting off the bus at Ossington and College...Lo and behold.  

The reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is because for the price the portion is quite small compared to other ME restaurants.  The selection is great though and they have a lot of desserts! 

The staff were nice, the food was pretty good and the washroom was clean, even though it was late!  This is very rare for a single stall (one man one woman washrrom) kind of arrangement and I appreciate them making sure of it :P"}
{"text":"The food is fresh and homemade just how all the shawarma places should be... The only problem is that their prices keep on going up and portions are getting smaller. Its almost 20$ for a plate with barely any chicken or salad they just fill it up with rice. I mean not to sound cheap but thats almost the price of a main course at a high end restaurant. That's very unfortunate 
I hope they can adjust to the competition or I'll be going elsewhere"}
{"text":"Went for a walk around the nieghbourhood last night and popped into the first take-out place I saw, looking for a late dinner. Given that it was 9pm on a Monday night, I assumed I'd be receiving premade, stale falafel slapdashed onto a pita. Not so! They formed and fried the patties in front of my eyes. As I waited for them to cook, I watched them chop vegetables and make a new batch of taboule (keepin things fresh at 9pm on a weekday? Love it!) and they chatted me up about their business (been there over 25 years, were awarded best shwarma in Toronto in 2009!) 

I had my sandwhich with all the veggies, hot sauce and garlic sauce. The red onion was just chopped so it over powered the falafel a little bit, and I made the silly decision to go light on sauce. For this, I can only blame myself...

Super nice couple, good fresh food, go light on onions and get extra sauce. Will return for shawarma!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is fresh and all homemade and the husband, wife duo offer amazing customer service!! We eat here almost once a week. We like to order the donair plate. Our two year old son eats the food too and absolutely loves it. The plate is very large and filling and is full of veggies and meat! The taste is amazing as well. Highly recommended. Best Mediterranean in Toronto hands down!"}
{"text":"They made the falafel fresh at 3am, and topped it with freshly made tabouli, vinegar-ey cabbage, and fearlessly spicy hot sauce. They didn't skimp. The pita was fresh. I almost cried. I was pretty drunk, though, so that might have more to do with the emotional response. But seriously, the BEST falafel I've had in the city thus far."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot on many occassions. There have been several times I am running late for a gig and I am starving, so College Falafel is always on my way and I tend to grab a falafel, shawarma or some samosas -- something quick and portable. I really need to expand my selection though because this place is apparently known for their Halifax donair. In fact, the last time I was there these two girls came in and were raving to the owners about the donair and how great it was. (Update: I have since had the Halifax donair and it's delicious. In fact, it trumps the falafel or shawarma option hands down.)

They are open until 3:00am on Friday and Saturday but they close at 10:00pm on other days, which is not late enough for an owl such as myself. They're not exactly cheap either... Shawarmas are 5 bucks and falfels are $4.40 -- what happened to the $2.99 falafel in Toronto? They recently expanded and are now twice the size with a makeshift \"dining\" area. Expect this place to be a zoo at 2:30am on Saturdays."}
{"text":"Still very tasty but I was shocked when we recently visited for take-out and the price came up to almost $20 for two shawarma wraps. They're not particularly large, either. A little pricey for a chicken wrap, in my opinion. I know they're a mom and pop business and need to pay the bills, but $20 for like, $3 worth of ingredients is a bit much. Won't be coming here on a frequent basis anymore, despite it being so close to home. What a shame."}
{"text":"Fresh parsley chopping in the window. All the veggies. Mediterranean aromas. Beets, parsnips, and cabbage... pickled in-house, light! And the jumbo falafel balls are home-made, secret recipe, crisp, flavourful and fresh! Fluffy, whole-wheat pita. Good sized sandwich. Hold the garlic mayo, tahihi and hot sauce, yes please!

Take it from those who know: Last time I was there, the owner of another falafel restauraunt was in front of me, buying his lunch. I'm not kidding! I'll keep the name secret, though.
Not to worry, I was served quickly."}
{"text":"One of the best in Toronto. Not cheap however the quality and portion size make up for it. Highly Recommended!"}
{"text":"Ordered some platters here for an event for 80 people. They don't do delivery, so you have to pick the food up from the store, but the prices are very reasonable and the owners were so nice and accommodating. We placed the order less than 48 hours in advance, but they were still able to do it last minute. 

The food was a hit! We got a bunch of beef and chicken shawarma platters that came with tabouli salad, pitas, eggplant, etc. The meat was delicious, juicy, and flavourful. The falafel platters were awesome too. The falafel were light and not too dry, not too oily. I really liked the spanikopita as well. Syrup-y sweet baklava made for a perfect finish."}
{"text":"Quick service. Friendly. Delicious . healthy fresh wrap. I got the vegetarian eggplant. Clean dining area which makes me think the kitchen is the same. There food is not overly salty like other falafel places. A little pricier then other places but I don't mind since the quality was there. Will return"}
{"text":"Just north of the beaten track of College St. at Ossington sits a small, Middle Eastern snack counter.  I don't if I had heard the place was good or if  I just assumed it was because it was a filthy looking venue that had firmly been existing there for a while.  If anything could look this bad and not shut down, it had to be good.

Turns out it was a poor assumption on my part.  Starving, I went in there last night even though all my senses were telling me not to.  I shushed the snob in me and even bypassed the fruit f lies swarming around my head -- as if I were Pig Pen from Peanuts -- when I walked through the door.  I ordered an eggplant pita and the married couple who own the joint were very friendly.  But the food was really not good.  Bland, soggy, and dirty is how I would describe my meal and I felt I was being generous by taking 2 bites."}
{"text":"Best falafel and shawarma in Toronto! Been looking for a place that serves good middle eastern sandwiches for year...I found it! The staff are extremely sweet. Rice pudding is incredible too!"}
{"text":"Last night I heard about a donair shop in Halifax that has a 24-hour webcam directed at their donair spit.  I watched it for a bit and that had me craving a donair.  So I headed for lunch today to College Falafel (at Ossington Avenue and College Street) for an \"east coast\" donair.  I've been there before for a donair.

There is a wide variety of condiments and I got just tomatoes and donair sauce.  The donair is served in a pita pocket, which isn't quite traditional but worked out okay.  It was delicious and messy.  The meat was good and the sauce was tasty.

The owners were very nice and friendly.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We go here for the donair on a weekly-biweekly basis, and we love it! 

I know it's not traditional with donair to get all the veggies that you'd typically get with  shawarma but the salads and pickles are good for making you feel like your donair plate is actually healthy. Well, the  rice and potatoes that come with the plate are tasty too but they'll customize your plate how you want - leave off the rice and potatoes if you're low-carbing and want just meat and salad. 

The sweet donair sauce is to die for! 

It's kinda pricey at $9 for an East Coast donair wrap and $14 for a plate, but they are generous with the portions, and it's worth it to support this family owned restaurant. The owners are the most hardworking couple ever. If you go more than once, they'll definitely remember you. 

Open till 3 AM Fridays and Saturdays. A couple of seats outside in the summer, which is lovely. I only wish they did delivery!"}
{"text":"Ok i want to give the place five stars because of how nice and cute the couple are. And to make matters worse, they proudly showed me how they were in the newspaper today. 

But the truth is, this is an Albanian couple making arabic food and It's missing the arabic taste. The food is not really that good.

But on a positive note, certain things are. The spinach pie is good, and the stuffed pepper is really good. But all the other staple dishes like hummus, shawarama's, tabule, chick pea salad are extremely flavourless.

But the food is made from scratch according to their claim and the couple is super nice. And the place is open late. And really, if you haven't eaten a lot of real arabic food, this place is perfectly fine. 

This place is really a 2.5"}
{"text":"Love the donair and baklava!  I would give 5 stars but counter service is quite slow although friendly.  The last time we went we ordered a greek salad at the same time we ordered our donairs.  The salad was still being made when our donairs were ready and was not even finished by the time we were done.  

We will be back"}
{"text":"Wow. Just finished my falafel in the park and I'm thoroughly impressed. Fantastically light texture. Great flavor. Nice size. Made to order. And super friendly owners. A buck or two more expensive than your average falafel but well worth it. Be back soon."}
{"text":"Best falafel I've ever had.  And so glad it is right around the corner from my house!"}
{"text":"Fresh and healthy tasting. The woman making my falafel at 130am really seemed to care about making it properly. I was impressed. The lamb plate my friend ordered was a delicious revelation - a nice variation on the standard chicken and falafel plates."}
{"text":"Located on my way home from everywhere, I started going to College Falafel years ago. It turns out that I share a nationality with the very friendly couple who own it, and thus we always have something to talk about.

Their falafels are decent, though slightly on the bland side- however, what I really like is how incredibly fresh they are, as the balls are fried (ha-ha) on an order-by-order basis. I have had my share of those that are to get dry and stale, sitting out all day, so this is a welcome difference.

I am a big fan of their chicken shawarma, which is really juicy and extra tasty both in its own seasoning and garlic sauce- making up for the lesser-so falafel, in my opinion. Their spinach pies are good enough, but I have been spoiled by spending so much time in Greektown lately."}
{"text":"College Falafel is owned by kindest couple you will ever meet. They have been restaurant owners for 30 years. Twenty years at their previous location, another ten years at this location. College Falafel existed before me. I adore unassuming hole-in-the-wall mom and pop shops!

Who can complain about healthy homemade food made from scratch with love? The display window was filled with bowls of bright fresh parsley and spinach. A tray of fresh out of the oven cheese pie was displayed prominently. The perfect stimulus to draw you into the store! I salivated like the dog from Pavlov's experiment as soon as I saw the food display!

College Falafel serves falafels wraps ($7.00) made to order! The owner forms the falafels with a mold as soon as the order is placed. It was moist and crisp. The yogurt sauce, marinated beet salad, pickled turnip and hot sauce added layers of flavour to the simple wrap! 

My friend ordered the beef donairs dinner. He said it was \"so good\", then devoured the plate of food. I managed to steal some perfect spiced food off his plate! The rice, tabouli salad, potato, beet salad, pickled turnip and donaire complimented each other. It was an interplay of flavor."}
{"text":"Solid 3.  Nice lamb shawarma.  5 or 6 tables.  Washrooms.  Friendly service.  They really prepare your food in full view, which is nice.  I'd go back if in the area for a quick bite - there aren't that many places in the area to get a good quick lunch to go."}
{"text":"Food: The falafel sandwich was great - fresh, homemade falafels made-to-order, and a complete set of fixings to go on the sandwich; you name it, they had it - hummus, beets, pickled turnip, tahini, etc. Everything tasted fresh and flavourful. The prices seem a bit steep at first, but given the portion size and quality of food, it is fair value

Service and atmosphere: The seating is pretty barebones and feels more like a fast food joint. The service is wonderfully friendly though!"}
{"text":"Ordered their falafel wrap ($7.50 CAD + HST) - I was able to see them fry the falafels from start to finish as I presume they try to make things to order. They had the standard fare in terms of toppings for your wrap - though it seemed a little lacking compared to other similar places I've been. It didn't seem like the falafel had much of a chance to harden during the frying process since it felt like I was simply eating the paste that it was before it went right into the fryer. 

For the portion size, it did seem pricey compared to other places I've been. Not to mention that the plates or if you want something additional like fries - it's not cheap."}

I liken the We Serve Halifax Donairs sign that shines above the College Falafel sign to The Star of Bethlehem above Jesus' manger. At least to drunk east coasters. 

I grew up in Hali, so here is my take on their donair. They nailed the sauce and I'm fine with any kind of pita, so no complaints there, and you have to ask for the Halifax toppings (they'll try to give you more than just onions and tomatoes, foolish folks). The only real issue is the meat. It is too crumbly and not quite right. But hey, this will get you your fix. It's no Fuzz Box, though. 

They also serve a half shawarma/half donair called The Kent Special. Kent is my friend. He is disgusting. 

PEPPER'S PISSED At that jack ass who stole my cab from out in front of here not too long ago. Beware the drunks on this corner. So many drunks. I think I'm one of the few who will eat a donair sober. Extra sauce."}
{"text":"i was craving Falafel...I stepped off the bus, and this place was here...and open!
this very tiny shop cranks out some pretty awesome food, specifically I had the lamb wrap, I was very happy with this choice. the service was quick and the staff were very friendly. my only negatives about this spot would be the lack of toppings for the wraps, and the size of the restaurant is tiny...not much standing room while ordering. 
if you are in the neighborhood, check it out!!!"}
