{"text":"Falafel is sooo good. Their service is so crappy though. The waiter seats you and forgets you exist, you literally have to flag them down to order or ask for anything. Sucks because this places decor and food are so good!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and authentic dishes, helpful and friendly staff, beautiful Arabic decoration. The taste of the pomegranate sauce is well integrated with the dishes and this is what makes this place special. It is yet the best place in Mississauga. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Came in for Friday dinner. Got seated quickly as it wasn't full. No one came by though to take order. Staff moved around slowly, cleaning other tables, ignoring us. Got fed up and left. Not coming back."}
{"text":"I visit the restaurant after 8 months of my last visit. ...I was surprised by the bad changes that they made.....the food becomes extremely expensive for the served food they rose mixed grill price from 17$ to 23$ and the provided amount of food does not suite the price payed and the pop can is for 4$ Morever, the restaurant was totally empty inspite of being Saturday lunch, whereas it was very crowded even in weekdays before they increased their prices this means that everyone agree that it does not worth eating at this cuisine anymore....and I expected that it will totally fails in foreseeable future"}
{"text":"We went there at 9.50 and despite them closing at 10.30pm, they turned 4 paying customers. Either change your official timings so people do not drive all the way just to be turned down.  The food was good last time but the pomegranate juice was expensive and not fresh, despite them saying it was!"}
{"text":"The customer service was very very poor. I was shocked by the arrogance of the person who waited at our table because she didn't let us have what we wanted, and didn't help us out either. She was arrogant and condescending in her attitude, making comments like \"I cant come back later to take further orders\", while saying at the same time that what we had ordered was insufficient, and generally being mean about us being non Arabs and therefore not having enough knowledge about Arabic cuisine, which was a mis-judgement on her part.   She was always trying to make us less confident about what we wanted to eat, and instead kept pushing for us to order more food than we could eat, which we thankfully didn't do, despite her looking down at us like a school teacher from the 19th century. I don't think I will ever go back there if they have this kind of rude service!"}
{"text":"Hands down BEST middle eastern restaurant I ever been too and I been in a lot of them!!! Try their Manakesh, my god it's better than the one in middle east!!"}
{"text":"After hearing mixed reviews, my friends and I decided to try this place out on a Saturday night for dinner.  We were not allowed to be seated until all parties arrived.  The menu is mediocore, similar to Paramount but fancier and overpriced.  After going through the menu at least 5 times, I had to settle for the chicken shawarma, which turned out to be plain (filled with a few pickles) and no sauces or flavour. The food arrived late and not in sequence (appetizers were served as mains).  They also forgot my friend's order so she had to eat alone when the rest of us were already done. We were given a pudding to make up for it, which also lacked in flavour or taste.  The juices are probably the only thing that tasted exceptional.  Basically, you are paying for the atmosphere and fancy cutlery."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, unfortunately it was not to be. I had previously heard great things and seen beautiful photos of the restaurant so I had high hopes. Upon walking in, it certainly is quite beautiful. Gold decor on the tables and overall restaurant 'look' is probably one of the top in Mississauga. The gold water goblets tasted like metal and were gross, they really need to get normal water glasses.  The servers were dressed in traditional Syrian garb which is a nice touch.  However, when it came to service and food, it was lacking. We came on a weeknight, they were half full yet it took a while for someone to take our order. We ordered a hummus with beef, fattoush salad, and the a beef sandwich. The fresh bread was nice, the hummus was average, and the beef was dry and didn't have much taste. As for the salad, it would have been nice had it been served in a wide bowl. They served it in a tall metal bucket, which yes does look cool, but is not the most easy way to eat a salad. For the price of this basic meal, you could go elsewhere and have a high end better tasting meal."}
{"text":"Decent and affordable Mediterranean food. Nice to see someone is deviating from the norms of parmount and designing a pleasing atmosphere with cool decor and awesome menu options. I only eat the Manakeesh and find them filling with amazing flavour."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Syrian food, I loved this restaurant. The only issue I had was that the service was a little slow, but then again the restaurant is still very new and their great food makes up for it! This has become my favourite place to go when I visit Toronto."}
{"text":"We did not like it at all... We've paid too much just to eat the pita and salad... most the (meat) got left as is with small notches of scarry bites Never come back again One thing more, after we got waited too long on the rest. front door... The manager came to us and said: Ok .. You can sit here BUT, you have to finish before 5:0 O'clock because the rest. has a big reservation !!!!!!  It was the most rude and salvage behavior from a hospitality guide to a customer  !!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food & service doesn't match the decor. Service is awful, fast food joints gave me better service man. Waited so long while the servers kept attending preferred customers and the food was dry, also pricy for the quality. They won't last long with this behavior, word travels fast in Sauga."}
{"text":"Someone had recommended this place to me, so decided to go there with some of my friends.  We were seated within few minutes of arrival by a very friendly staff member dressed in traditional Syrian (I think) outfit.   We ordered hummus to start with and it came with fresh pita. I wish I had known that they will refill pita as we finished all of the hummus by it self before they refilled pita tray.   Food was delicious and different than usual mediterranean joint. Their pomegranate and date drink was great.  very nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Was at this place last night, and although food is a bit on the expensive side, we were really impressed with the food quality. We found the food to be really tasty and fresh. After reading other comments on this place, I have to agree that service is not the fastest. We were there for quite a bit and were told that some of the meals we ordered (Kebabs) would take about 30 mins to prepare. Other items such as the pizza's came extremely quick (Less than 5 mins maybe). At the end of our night, we were still there for over an hour. Overall, this place was good. The owner was extremely polite and very attentive. He took the time to walk us through the menu, explaining each item and telling us what were his most popular dishes (Mind you this place was a bit slow the night we went). We had a good time and will surely come back. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Amazing place.. Beautiful atmosphere, lovely hostesses and the owner was also very hospitable. The place is looks so impressive. The mix grill platter was very tasty along with the beiruti hummus. Cheese saj was also very good."}
{"text":"The ambiance is exquisite, and the food lives up to expectations.   The folks giving such poor reviews are probably not used to going to an authentic middle Eastern place. Allow me an opportunity to rebut:  The service is not meant to be intrusive. If you need something, you get their attention. Simple as that. If you want your bill, ask for it.   The food is amazing. The flavours reminiscent of my time in Damascus (the restaurant in Montreal). Their fresh pita, spreads, grilled meats all lived up to my expectations.   I heartily recommend this place. Go and rejoice."}
{"text":"we were group of 8 and went there last night. We wanted to try new place but reluctant to try this place due to low ratings. Trust me I have been to so many places but this one was awesome. serving was great from starter salad/ humus to main course meat platter (I'm not a fan of beef or lamb/goat due to typical smell but the person assured me for no smell and yes it was awesome)and fresh pom/watermelon juice. service was quick and food was fresh. I found it much much better then bakhtar, baamiyan and paramount. We will definitely refer to friends and return again soon.overall beyond our expectations. Owner was nice and generous too getting a fair feedback."}
{"text":"Before you get into the good n the bad note that I haven't tried everything on the menu but still account for variety of dishes and yet I will come back to try more. I'm always glad to see such restaurants that allow us to reminisce and indulge  Pros 1. Exquisite decor - modern/traditional fusion ambience  2. Friendly service with a smile n yes traditional outfits  3. Food presentation builds the appetite  Cons 1. Food was cold  (mainly grill, potatoes sausage) 2. Quality was average - not a place I wanna come on a weekly basis :( once in a few months maybe"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  We had the beef/chicken shawarma plate, shush tawook plate, the mixed grill special, zatar bread, and the thin strips is steak.  EVERYTHING was delicious!  The bread and rice with the meal was so fresh and flavorful!  The restaurant is beautifully designed and was very clean.  Our table had nice cutlery and the servers were dressed in traditional clothing which was a nice added touch!  There is a nice little fountain the middle of the restaurant and the fire oven is visible through a glass wall.  The bathroom is very clean.  There is a prayer space which is very clean and comfortable and this is greatly appreciated!!!  I've been a customer of paramount for years but this place had the potential to be a lot better.  High quality food that is fresh and with a much nicer ambience.  This was out first visit and I'm looking forward to coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I thought I walked into the women's washroom. What an arrangement for the washrooms for a middle eastern place. I walked in confused as one can be and I see \"M\" and \"W\". Simple but confusing when their is no separation between the two and the stalls are right in front of you. I look to my left and a girl is doing her make up who runs into the stall as I see her. So confused and maybe embarrassed that I was in the wrong area I run into the stall that I have now figured out belongs to the men`s side. For a moment I thought I was the actor unknowingly being filmed in a Bollywood movie with the turn of events that took place to warrant me to write an entire paragraph on their washroom situation.  So despite my comments the food was quite decent. I liked the chicken and presentation. I like the ethnic sufi wear they where wearing as servers. I liked the clean décor.   Back to the bad again though. Service. Fail! Why? My friend got his Sujuk 15 minutes before me while I waited for my shish tawook platter. The shish tawook platter was $14.99 - a bit high for an average restaurant with minor service. The cups that we initially had on our table for water had some water in them - do they clean them after a customer leaves? I took my chances on that one. The bread came at the end of the meal? I thought bread was an appetizer, shouldn't it be placed as the first thing? I mean, I am not a foodie, but I would think these are standard things.  I was quite excited about a new Syrian restaurant since the last one that opened near my home, Damas. I would say they are an equal pairing of different interpretations of Syrian décor and food. Try both once I say!"}
{"text":"This is my third time over at Roman Zaman, and my last time.  I almost have the same experience every time I go there. Sat down, 5 minutes later(only two tables occupied) the waitress came to ask me if I'm ready to order ( no one asked me if I want to start with a drink or an appetizers)Waited long time for the food and a longer time for some one to recognize that I'm here. I waited 37 minutes to have some one to come and ask me if I'm ready to check out, or even if I want a drink. I can get same or even better quality food some where else, with a much better service. That is it for me."}
{"text":"Very bad service had to wait for 40 min and didn't get fork or plate or the tea or coffee. Restaurant manager and stuff are so reluctant and inexperienced. Had to leave without eating anything. Don't recommend anyone to go."}
{"text":"Visited Roman Zaman over a business lunch. The decor looks authentic and just pops! The menus were sharp and to the point while the waiters were dressed in their traditional garbs which added to the experience. My colleague and I ordered the mixed grill, lentil soup, fatoush salad, damascan vine leaves and watermelon and pomegranate cooler. Our waiter was prompt very hospitable, always asking if things were adequate. He also made excellent recommendations that were accurate. Food was terrific! The grilled meats were moist (they arrived covered in a spiced pita) and paired very well with the with garlic sauce and lentil soup. Dessert was a cheese infused platter which we washed down with fresh cardamom tea. If you are in the mood for some authentic middle eastern or as the restaurant touts, Damascan food, then this place is for you. The restaurant seems to be capable of handling large parties as well so you visitors with large families rejoice!"}
{"text":"I did my engagement ceremony in Roman Zaman. Since we first met the hostess to talk with her about the event, we noticed how friendly and professional the staff was. Decoration was authentic lovely syrian decoration and its clear that the owner spent alot on it. Unique atmosphere. The serving utensils were unique, made of authentic copper and made especially for Roman Zaman from abroad. We were directed to the Manager, Mr. Nabeel, who was very friendly, professional, helpul and accomodating. The event was in Ramadan Holy Month on Iftar Buffet, he modified the buffet menu according to our own preferences and our guests although we did not book the whole resturant (35 adults event only+ children). All staff were very helpful! Food was very delicious with high quality and our guests had great time! They put music for us during the ceremony and performed all ceremony related activities perfectly. It was a very joyful day! The staff even congratulated us! We felt like one big family with them. I highly recommend Roman Zaman for events!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. It clearly says that the place closes at 10. We got there at 9:15 but were told the kitchen closed already at 9:30....even though it was 9:15. We were refused entry."}
{"text":"First let me say that the food was excellent it tasted great and was very satisfactory. I shared the Roman Zaman grill with my girlfriend as well as a side of chicken wings and beef sausages. The chicken wings were tiny but juicy and the mini sausages were well seasoned. The differing kabobs skewers that came with our meal tasted great and the hot pitas that accompanied it was delicious.   My only issue with this restaurant was the fact that we came in a group of 10 and they had difficulty seating us. We had to wait 20 mins before we could be seated due to the lack of tables. When we were finally seated the appetizers came quickly but the main course took around 25-30mins before it arrived. We were extremely hunger and the wait was agonizing. However the food was exemplary.  4/5 would come back again but I would recommend that you come with a smaller group."}
{"text":"I loved the experience. Perfect atmosphere for singles, families and couples. The food was delicious and the service was very good. I especially enjoyed the presentation, I have never seen plating on wooden trays like this before but it looked exceptionally good."}
{"text":"One of the worst places to eat  Went to have lunch , ordered kababs and what i got was 6 tiny little pieces of cold grilled beef chunks ..!  This place is disgrace for middle eastern cuisine..!  The only good thing about this place is the decor and the way the place looks ...!  The waitress was rude , not even a smile or a word of welcoming . If i can give it less than a star i would've but i cant so here is a half star for it and never EVER goin back ."}
{"text":"Well I am impressed. Food 5 Ambience 5 Portions good size. Waiting at least 30-40 mins for weekend dinner. Service is very slow but I ll definitely go again. Pom Molasses sauce is must try with every savoury item."}
{"text":"One of my friend had recommended me this place. When someone recommends me something I make sure I go to that place and order almost everything they have and thats what exactly I did over here too.   I had ordered for starter Cheese Falafel Saj, Hummus and Mutabbal. This was the best fresh Saj I have had in Canada by far. Main course I ordered Roman Zaman Platter, Sheesh skewer, Arayes and Fattoush. After taking my order the server asked me \"Sir are you sure this isn't too much?\" I don't regret ordering all this because everything I ordered was GOOD.  Decor: 5.0 Service: 4.0 Food: 4.0  Overall this place is the best Middle eastern food you can get in Mississauga.   Recommendation: Don't forget to order Saj !"}
{"text":"After few month in operation, I still believe this is the best Arabian place. Few authentic Syrian dishes with great taste. Quality comes with a price so the prices here are higher than a typical Middle Eastern/Arabian places. I think it's worth it. Manakeesh here are the best in town. In my opinion they are better than Paramount. I love the mushroom soup and the Fateh in this place. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"i will still keep my 3 stars, i ordered the cheese with sausage saj,and i was disappointed. although i got it hot but it did not taste the best, i think i will stick to my cheese saj.  watermelon juice fresh and definitely real fruit.   got my orders to go, which i got it fairly quick comparing to previous times, BUT took them over 10 minutes to knowledge me and other patrons that were waiting to be seated. so their staff needs to work on that or hire a hostess geez! and this was not the first time for me to be left standing like that, last time i simply walked off because i was there for over 10 minutes, only came back cuz i craved the watermelon juice!"}
{"text":"~ A solid 3.5 stars ~  This here is authentic taste of Damascus in the heart of Mississauga. My partner in crime and I wanted to go some place different and this place was it. The vibe and atmosphere was amazing and that is the reason for some hefty prices compared to others restaurants plus the service was a bit slow. Hence, that is the reason they gave me mixed emotions and received a solid slightly above A-OK rating.   The experience as soon as you enter was amazing with right furniture in place and halal certification right at the entrance, slightly turned down by no one coming to seat us even though there were servers right there who weren't acknowledging us. Along came the manager or may be the owner, friendly person; had us seated and gave us a high chair as well. We started to look into the menu and the choices were plenty...Hence, we ordered a few items, so put their food to taste and tried their:  - FALAFEL- Chickpeas mixed with parsley, onions, garlic, mint, chili powder, cinnamon, cumin and golden fried.  This here was in the appetiser section but was like a meal. The felafels were big and tasted great, due to the fact they were made fresh.  -ROMAN ZAMAN KIBBEH (MIX) - 2 Fried beef kibbeh, 2 fried potato kibbeh, 2 Fried Helah kibbeh and 2 Grilled Beef Kibbeh.  Now Kibbeh was something new and it was like a Jamaican patty. Some of the types were amazing and some not so much.  - ROMAN ZAMAN SHAWARMA PLATTER - Beef and chicken Shawarma, pomegranate molasses, garlic sauce.  This here was not bad and the meat was cooked well.  Presentation of the food was very well. The portion size were ok but as mentioned above the price was on the high-end and could get very expensive with a bigger family.  I also got their Watermelon juices which was more like slushy but was amazing.  They also have tall hats at the entrance to wear and a picture can be taken at their funky entrance seat.  Overall, A decent place to try but can't be done on a regular basis.  For my Muslim folks - The food here is halal, I confirmed with the server and their certifications are on the wall at the entrance."}
{"text":"The decor is really nice. Servers dressed in traditional attire is cool.  Food was subpar. I kept comparing it against some of the other restaurants and the price to quality (not quantity) just doesn't add up.  The shawarma is really oily. The grilled mixed meats are dry. The hummus is meh.... it's the only word I can think of right now.   Also the guy..not sure if he's the owner or manager could be more useful. Help the servers out.. why do you stand around doing nothing. Also he's very rude. I personally haven't had a bad experience but I over heard the conversations with other guests."}
{"text":"The food is good , authentic syrian cuisine. Service could use some improvement though . Sometimes the waiters/waitress seem a little clueless and the owner/ manager (he does both ) walks around frequently but doesnt directly help staff. I know hes the owner and all but personally i like to see a owner who doesnt mind getting his hands dirty , and serves tables etc as opposed to just walking around. Anyway 4 stars for quality of food . Hope they can improve service though"}
{"text":"Good food and they staff is very friendly. They quality of the food is not as good as paramount."}
{"text":"The place is incredible. The food is so delicious and  the service is fast and very good. I stopped by the place as I was exploring the area. Everything on the table was so delicious. The atmosphere is cozy and the decorations are beautiful. Try the place you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great quality ingredients, great chicken kebab with fresh bread. If your into to hot sauces try theres! Only downside is wait time for chicken kebab was around 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Absolutely beautiful restaurant! The decor is second to none.   The food unfortunately, is not in the same caliber. The saaj is the only thing worth coming back for. The kebabs are very dry and bland.   I'd recommend checking the place out and having a Saj for lunch."}
{"text":"Best middle eastern food in North America hands down. Portions are huge. Staff is extremely professional and attentive at all times. It's really authentic, I felt like I was eating in Syria."}
{"text":"I gotta give 4 stars to the decor etc. There aren't many good looking halal restaurants out there. Loved the traditional outfits of the servers. The serving dishes/tea cups were lovely as well.  However ,we come to a restaurant mainly for food. And that kept me longing for more. Not in quantity but in quality. I've definitely had better kababs and shawarmas in Toronto. The sausages were okay. The garlic chilli potatoes were good just a tad bit oily.   Everything Looks great, tastes M-eh. Overall experience A-OK.   Decent place for a friends or family outing. next time I'm in 'Sauga though, you'll find me in a hole-in-the-wall joint munching my messy shawarma sitting on a plastic chair and table ;)"}
{"text":"Been here, food is decent and ambiance is really cool. I was really hoping this place would be good and I had high hopes but our experience with service was horrible. First we had to wait to be asked our order (I don't think anyone was designated our server), then we ordered and asked them to bring all the food at once so that some people's food wouldn't get cold, they didn't do that. When they finally did bring the food, they brought the wrong food for half of us. Finally when they did get everyone's order out, the initial ones they brought were cold, and we, (like most people) wanted to start eating together. This led to half of us not enjoying our meal.   Then we ordered teas, when doing so I asked the server to confirm the order (since they messed our last one up), she then confirmed. However when they brought the teas, they messed up the orders for half of these too! This again led to half of the teas being cold by the time they brought the right ones out.   What made this more shocking was that they had a host monitoring the entire service. However, the worst part of it all was that no one really apologized, instead they came to us with confusion like \"are you sure this what you got?\" I'm pretty sure that's now how you run a classy restaurant.  I would say the food and experience is definitely nice, and I would love to take friends of different ethnic background here to show them the cool middle eastern ambiance, but until they figure out their issues between servers and the kitchen I just can't go back.   Also, I generally am not one to complain about service but I really hope they see this and realize that getting the orders right is CRUCIAL to running a restaurant. I don't know if it was just that one night or whats going on, but really really unfavorable experience considering they had been open for some time by then."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Syrian food and outstanding decor. Mixed grill platter is recommended as well as the suj. Lemon/mint drink is refreshing.  They don't take reservations so if you are with a large group expect a bit of a wait. This is a very busy restaurant.  Would have got a 5/5 on food + ambiance alone if the service was not so shabby."}
{"text":"Giving them 3 stars for the nice decor and for the appetizers. Main dishes were a bit of disappointment to be honest."}
{"text":"I went on a Friday night with a friend. They don't take reservations on Friday nights. We arrived at about 8:40pm. There was a huge line of people waiting. It took a while before someone greeted us (or should I say.. until we found someone to put our name down). The gentleman advised there was a 30 min wait and that they close at 10pm. We decided to stay and wait because we were eager to try this place out.  While waiting, I noticed how poor the service is.. tables were not cleared right away. No wonder the wait time was so long. After we were seated, we sat there and waited.. and waited... Nobody approached us to ask for drinks or to take our order. We told 3 different servers who walked by that we were ready to order. TERRIBLE SERVICE.  My friend got one of the kabobs.. I can't remember which one. I ordered the Labneh with Falafel Saj. Not a fan of Labneh so I substituted that with veggies and tahini sauce on the side. The food was good. We both ordered tea. We had to remind 2 different servers that our tea hadn't arrived yet. I'm not sure if they are understaffed, if they require some organization, or the staff is just not properly trained..  There were large groups, couples, and families. The restaurant is nicely decorated and pricing is fair.  The service was awful and doesn't make up for the good food and fair pricing. I would not go back even if they paid me to."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The service, the ambiance and most of all the food is incredible.  Everything is super fresh and amazingly tasty  I recommend it and cant wait to return  Try the lemon with mint juice, the fattoush, tabboule was the freshest i ever had, the mhammara, the dessert.  Ohh i loved everything i ordered  A few birthdays were celebrated while i was there and it was very special  The service was great and it was a full restaurant.    I give it a ten on ten rating"}
{"text":"the decor is beautiful & everything is very traditional. The servers are dressed up and the cutlery and cups are gold. There are a lot of artifacts and it's very interesting when you walk in. You can see into the kitchen and see a huge fire in there wood oven  BUT THATS IT. That's the only things I liked about this place. All the food is À la cart & over priced for what you're getting. I got a beef shawarma and it was 12$ and so small and so sub par. I've had a better shawarma for 5$ I was so so so disappointed. I had four bites and put it down. My boyfriend got the lentil soup that was served luke warm and was very plane.   I was so disappointed in this place after hearing the hype and would never go back.   Also the gold cups are beautiful but all you taste is metal when drinking from them.   ugh left this place so un impressed."}
{"text":"So in short, restaurant gets a 4, manager gets a 1...   Ok .. So: -the food is good  -Portions are ok.. They should be more compared to the price - the decor was really nice - the manager is awful... He was busy making sure his suit looks good .. He ignored people waiting at the door for more than 10 mins even when there were a lot. Of empty tables.. He would call a waiter just to move a cup instead of helping like any good manager would do...."}
{"text":"I took my wife there on a date. We were not disappointed. The food there is so fresh and so authentic. You can taste the freshness in the food. We ordered their shawarma and we had the garlic chicken wings as starters.  The staff were very friendly. The manager was very nice too.  I can't wait to be back there!  I'd definitely recommend people to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Great food swarawa platter is great choice. The service was fast and kind. I will be coming back. Good price. Quality was in match to similar restaurant in the area"}
{"text":"Very tasty and authentic middle eastern food.  Mixed Grill platter and garlic Chicken wings were a favourite.  Cardamom tea is also a must. The service is very good and price is reasonable.  You have to experience dinner in this gracious place."}
{"text":"After a long time we have found an authentic Mediterranean cuisine! The ambience, the tables and chairs to the lighting, all complementing the decor. Love the mother of pearls intricately carved into the wooden furniture at the entrance and welcoming table along with the flower and colourful bowl. The shish taowk, kabab, rice and hummus/mutabel was perfect!Very courteous staff! The kaneff is to top it all! The dessert special mentioned by the manager! Would highly recommend this place to people who enjoy Mediterranean cuisine and who have a good taste for ambience!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend loves this so she has taken me here at least twice by now.  Full disclosure: I usually don't like middle eastern food, so this review is definitely biased.  It's the first time I had Syrian food. I couldn't really tell the difference between Syrian food versus any other type of middle eastern cuisine.   The decor was really cool. The cups, utensils, cutlery, plates, pitcher and everything else was very traditional. I even brought my parents here just so they can enjoy the decor as many halal restaurants don't do a good job at that.  The food for me was okay . My girlfriend and her family loves it. However my family and I thought it wasn't anything special. I have had their lentil soup, salads, their mankeesh, kebabs, traditional style pizza, and hummus.  I'd recommend experiencing Roman Zaman at least once. Even if you're not hooked on like my girlfriend, you won't regret giving it a try !"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience and food. Family and friends enjoyed the indoor water fountain sound. It took us absolutely to middle east theme, cant wait to try their Kabab this Saturday."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with chicken shawarma plate, please Some hummus, cheese Saj and tabouli on the side yummyy"}
{"text":"We brought the family to try out this restaurant for the first time because we heard great things about it. We definitely weren't disappointed! The food was amazing and the service was wonderful. The best part of the entire meal was the traditional tea ceremony at the end!"}
{"text":"The stars are for the beautiful decor! Food is the same ol with a fancy twist and highly overpriced. The quantities were small and service was very slow. We had to remind the waiter several times for everything! The $20 mixed grill was good for one person which is expensive. Hopefully it will get better with time"}
{"text":"The manager was a super idiot and was super rude. He is racist and has no idea how to talk to others. I called and ask if we can get a table, he said for 3 people it would be 10 mins wait. I said ok, I can go ahead. I drove from Ajax to have this and in the end got there 1.5 hrs before close. He said he can't seat me because there is already a family ahead. I told him I won't be coming back if I am not seated since it is still quite a while before close and we came from far away. In the end he said \"where do I seat you, on my head?\".  No matter what I won't be coming to this Douchebag again. He is a racist bastard too who commented saying \"go to an Indian or a Pakistani restaurant\". I would've easily knocked him out right then but I am not an asshole like him. I recommend people not to go to this racist asshole."}
{"text":"I have been here 3-4 times now. An okay restaurant. The decor is very nice. The food is okay as well but nothing outstanding. I liked their appetizers the most. The entries are hit or miss. The prices are somewhat expensive compared to other similar places to eat in Mississauga."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of middle eastern cuisine and I found the food there is too good. I experienced the best chicken shawarma in the town there. Their shawarmas are the authentic Arabian shawarma. Most of the shawarma places make their shawarma as a fusion using sauces but I found their Shawarma is same as original middle eastern shawarma. Their chicken shawarma is highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Went with two of my friends on a Saturday night...waited a bit in line but this was a happening place so I didn't mind too much.  Decor was really authentic which I liked..get the full experience along with the food.  We ordered a variety of items so we could get a little taste of everything. I have to say the food came out quick, presentable and taste was amazing. I couldn't find a falt...even the server was nice enough to describe the menu items for us.  We totally left there with full bellies and not so over priced bill and a craving to come back again.  I think most of you would probably already guess the stars I would give this place..*****.  Stay tuned for the next great review!!"}
{"text":"Lovely Arabic ambience! Good Food ! Loved the presentation... Wish they had more servers.... Service is the only reason I can't give them a 5 star....."}
{"text":"Excellent ramazan buffet.  Thought was expensive 39 dollars per person.  Variety was not big but too the point"}
{"text":"All that glitters is not gold is a perfect proverb which describes my experience at this restaurant!  I was very thrilled about trying this new restaurant in the area and wanted to unravel the hype it had around it and to my disappointment the experience as far as the service and food was beyond pathetic!  The only reason I would give it one star is due to the beautiful decor and effort to create a beautiful ambience apart from that that the restaurant has literally nothing to offer.  We walked in on a weeknight and got seated.After being seated we actually had to call in the server to take our order for the appetizer which was humus beiruty and a soup.Well the humus was below average and dry and came out immediately after the order placed but the soup took another 15 mins to be sent to our table.  Later we ordered chicken shawrma, mixed grill and kebabs.All our food came in intervals.First came chicken shawrma which was dry and flavorless.Next after asking for our remaining food the next two items came after a gap of 15 minutes.It all seemed like a joke to us-here we came to sit and enjoy this new restaurant instead we were served with our dinner in bits and pieces-All the mixed grill items looked appetizing but we're extremely dry and flavorless.They lacked the smokey grill taste to it.When we called the server and expressed our concern of the food being extremely dry she told us..THIS IS OUR STANDARD AND SAID TO ME YOU ARE THE FIRST ONE TO SAY THIS..HELLO???The staff needs to be trained to address to the complains/concerns in a better and more professional  manner.  We also had to call our server to give us our water glasses which I thought was absolutely bizarre.  Lastly we didn't order any desert assuming the flavor would be as pathetic as the flavor of the food and honestly didn't have the patience to wait any longer!!"}
{"text":"Sure I can understand why everyone is complaining about wait times, but once you take the first bite of anything on their menu you'll totally understand why.  EVERYONE wants to eat here! The food at this place is superb, delicious and unmatched in quality and presentation to any place in Toronto.  I'm Egyptian; have eaten shawarma all over the world - even in Damascus and Beirut - yet i think their chicken shawarma is the best I have ever had.  So good in fact that I avoid adding any sauces or condiments just to savour the pure rich taste.  You gotta try it.  Pure heavenly shawarma in bread that just came out of the oven. Mmmmm."}
{"text":"Their Fatoush was the best ever. However, their Arayes were not good at all, in my opinion at least. Grilled chicken and meat skewers were good. Service was not good at all. Although it was not very busy, our waitress barely showed up at our table; we had to keep calling for someone."}
{"text":"Beautiful venue, wonderful hospitality and service from the guest, food was ok the chicken was super hard to bite into for whatever reason. Overall it was pleasant."}
{"text":"Ever since the signage for this new restaurant went up, I've been checking up on the space periodically to see the progress.  After a couple of months of work, the result was an absolutely beautiful restaurant. The interior decor at this place is second to none. Wait staff are dressed in elegant, traditional clothing. Being inside this restaurant feels like being teleported to a faraway place and I think that it's absolutely awesome.  Setting such a fantastic ambiance is usually a bonus for good restaurants, but unfortunately the food and service is yet to catch up at this establishment.   I've been there twice now. My first visit was about a month ago - it was their 2nd day of their soft opening.  My party of 3 was promptly seated and given a menu. We decided to go with a mixed grill platter and a chicken/beef shawarma platter for our entrees, with a salad and eggplant/pomegranate appetizer to start.  That's when the nightmare began. To give context, we were seated at the front of the restaurant where there was the least traffic, and the place was absolutely packed on the 2nd day of its opening.   None of our food came within the first half-hour. Our entrees came out nearly 15 minutes apart, and before our appetizers. My shawarma platter came out cold. The mixed grill came out much later, also cold. Both tasted pretty good, but due to the fact that both dishes had already cooled down, I had to pretty much drench it in their house pomegranate sauce (delicious) and olive oil.   We had finished our entrees and were still hungry, waiting for our appetizers to arrive. We were nearly an hour into our visit now. For a salad and a grilled eggplant dish, this is unacceptable, and we followed up with the wait staff about the progress. 30 minutes later, we still did not have our dishes... And we were just getting fed up. One of the wait staff came and checked up on us, and when we told him we had still not received our order, he looked bewildered and said he'd resolve it immediately.   Surely enough, 5 minutes later we received our salad. It was just plain greens and some dressing. How did this take over an hour to prepare? It wasn't even the correct salad, as the one we ordered was supposed to come topped with pomegranate. 10 minutes later, we were given another salad - this time the correct one. We had already finished our salad by then, and politely told them that we wouldn't take the 2nd serving.  To finish the night, we received our eggplant dish. It had quite a unique grilled flavour that I've never had before, and it was quite tasty. However, it would've served a lot better as an appetizer, rather than as a dish received over an hour after finishing our entree.  --- First visit TL;DR? I visited a restaurant on their 2nd day of their soft opening, and they seemed wildly unprepared in every facet of the restaurant experience, especially service times and timing food to be released when still warm. The issues seemed to be correctable if given some attention. ---  On my second visit, I was just there to get a takeout order of their inexpensive takeout shawarma wraps. Surely they must've resolved their service issues by now, I thought.   Prior to ordering, I asked the staff taking my order what the estimated wait time would be for the shawarma wrap, and she told me it shouldn't take more than 10 minutes. The restaurant was much less busy than my first visit about 3 weeks ago, and I eagerly awaited my order.   Unfortunately, the same problems arose. I waited 25 minutes to receive a 6\" shawarma wrap, totally unacceptable if dining in, and even more so for a takeout order.   I'm extremely disappointed that it seems like they haven't improved in the weeks since opening, and I'm reluctant to give them another try regardless of how unique their offerings are.  Get your act together Roman Zaman, you're located in the heart of Mississauga and your location has tons of potential. I'd be a regular if you manage to get a better handle on your logistical shortfalls."}
{"text":"Really amazing shawarma, they also put fries inside the shawarma which makes it even more delicious, only reason I have 4 stars and not 5 is because they put too much salt"}
{"text":"We went to this place around 830 pm. The places closes at 10 pm. There were a few empty tables. We were a table of 7. I would not recommend this place for parties of 6 or more. The host took forever to talk to us and then they claimed they had to stop taking orders (an hour early). Definitely a not recommend - rude and don't want your $$"}
{"text":"Below average Arabic food! The prices are way too expensive for the quality of the food. The decor is really cool but for someone who eats Arabic food on the daily, this food did not impress at all. The service at the restaurant was not good as well as we had three different servers that worked our table and while the guy was quite nice the two girls were not as nice or helpful."}
{"text":"Went here for a family dinner and everyone enjoyed it. The restaurant has great ambiance and the decor is beautiful. The service was also decent. Only complaint is that their juices and tea are very overpriced- not worth it."}
{"text":"Very Solid choice for a middle eastern restaurant. I don't think i have had better middle eastern food in the GTA.  The highlight of our food was the hummus with pomegrante and beef, really innovative and extremely tasty. We also tried kibbeh mix and grilled mix and everything was good. Their bread is made fresh and the best part about the bread is it doesn't get hard like other breads from middle eastern restaurants do ahem..  paramount ahem .."}
{"text":"Ok this place is super awesome!   My family and I came here with some friends and man were we blown away. Being Lebanese, I can appreciate and acknowledge good middle eastern food and Syrians know how to cook! Their flavours are different from ours but still just as tasty!   The lentil soup I had was better than the one my mom makes! And my mom is an amazing cook!! So I was shocked when the flavours just kept on coming, the Fatteh was delicious, the Taboulé was tasty and the fatouch salad was different, I could have used some more sumac myself but it was a pleasant and satisfying different flavour pallet to a classic.   I love the falafel, they had a perfect balance of cumin and the right amount of crunch.   I think the only thing I thought was a little different and odd was my father ordered a chicken shawarma sandwich and they were served on a bun instead of pita. Don't get me wrong, he said it was tasty, but I'm used to it being on pita not a bun. I think next time I'd ask if they can put it on something different.   Otherwise this place is going to be a regular spot for my family and I!!   Check it out, oh and during the week... MAKE RESERVATIONS, it's always packed! Lineups out the door!"}
{"text":"Beautiful decor. The food was definitely amazing. Amazing flavours.  The hummus was delicious. It was my first time eating fattet yogurt, it was extremely delicious. Amazing flavours. Very satisfying. Fish and chips were really good. Labneh with falafel was delicious. Shamyah cheese was very good.  The only complaint would be their customer service. Nothing special.  Unorganized. Average. We did not feel welcome at all."}
{"text":"Amazing! Very good and friendly service. We had a large group with several kids and the waitstaff was very attentive. The food tasted like it came straight out of Damascus, very authentic! The presentation was beautiful. I loved the attention to detail, from the damascene fountain in the center, to the chandeliers, the staff uniforms, and even the serving platters and utensils. I will definitely return, and I would recommend anyone visiting to check it out."}
{"text":"Get the hummus with meat + fattet hummus + mhamara Saj and you will not regret it! Very authentic Mediterranean (Syrian/Lebanese) food and atmosphere. The food is delicious actually, and the decor and ambiance is very pretty. Took one star off for the service: they all seem to have a \"holier than thou\" attitude, which gets really annoying really quickly."}
{"text":"We keep coming back to this place because my friends and I love it! Their food is so delicious not to mention the rice! I don't know why but I love their rice so much. When we go, my friends usually buy platters to share because portions are big."}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this place. The decor looks amazing inside. But it was not to my expectations unfortunately  Taste was just ok. Am an avid food lover for all kind of cultural food. But Roman Zaman did not meet my level. The decor inside was great. You felt you entered in another world. Very Middle East atmosphere. Looked it. The washroom was wow again with the decor.  Customer service was good. No rude servers.   Food 2/5   For the portion we received, I find it was not even worth the price on top of that the taste was not great.  They are not flexible with the menu also.  We took 2 starters that came with oven bread. And we asked if one of them can be changed to rice. It was a big no. Which I respect. The oven bread was good too.  Sausage in pomegranate sauces-they came in as really mini sausages. Very dry amd got burnt ends. Merely got the sauce on it. Didn't even taste like anything.  Falafel- very dark in color. Tasted slightly different from the falafel am used to. Was ok  Roman zaman shawarma platter- beef & chicken.  Very dry both of them. Didn't have a great taste to it. Get the strong taste of the beef. Portion was small for the price.   The tahini sauce tasted great, their hot sauce was amazing.   Don't think I want to go back there unfortunately. Not for me. To each their taste"}
{"text":"Service has really gone down hill. Just as bad as paramount both with respect to food quality and quality of customer service. On top of that my entire family got really messed up after eating the shawarma which they completely forgot to bring out until we made a fuss twice  (they brought all the rest of the food out 15 mins ahead). The only nice thing is the decor. But honestly as a person of middle eastern decent this place is terrible."}
{"text":"Went there couple of days ago.   The restaurant is in a very good location.  The style is very unique and traditional.  Amazing.  Music is nice and suitable.  Food was amazing it kills paramount and any Arabic food in mississauga.   Fair amount of serving for what you are paying for People might think it is a little pricy,  but honestly it is worth it.   Servers were young people,  but good enough to handle the service.   Clean place.   A lot of food and drinks options.   I am going to come back to try their manakeesh.   Highly recommended.   Ask for morad,  he served my table and did a great job along his coworkers.  I hope they keep up the high quality and maybe get the workers to smile a little more :)"}
{"text":"I'd been eyeing this place for months so when the opportunity presented itself, I immediately dragged my family to come here with me. I'll admit that while reading the reviews, I was in two minds. There were really great ones, and then there were really bad ones. It was between here and Watan or Kandahar, so for the sake of trying something new, we chose Roman. Unfortunately, we left wishing we had gone to one of those instead. You've surely heard the saying, \"all that glitters isn't always gold\"? Tolkien must have had Roman Zaman in mind when he wrote that. As far as the copper cultery & decoration goes, we were certainly impressed. Service was seemingly good at the beginning but quickly became annoying.   Upon walking in, you're greeted by a beautiful, very traditional bench you can't help but sit down on and take a few pictures. All my energy went in to ensure my mother didn't pull out her phone to take a picture and instead be seated. Besides the bench, there's an odd out of place table at the front of the store with beautifully decorated bowls which also consumed equally as much energy out of me as my mum wanted to take them home. That pretty! Albeit very out of place. Ever been in a science fair where they display their projects on a table and you walk past and stare? It pretty much looked like an elementary school science fair exhibit.   We were seated very quickly and presented the menus (which were falling apart and could have used an upgrade or two) and our server gave us a few minutes before coming back to take our orders. Not long after he took our orders, the food came out. Rather promptly for a national holiday which we expected to be quite busy, however, was not (which is great if you're a family of hermits like we are!). I'd seen pictures of the food which looked colourful and opted for mushroom and lentil soup. The mushroom soup was superb, the portions of both were adequate considering it was a starter. Now, this is where it kind of went downhill and my initial excitement dissipated. The menu also stated that the lentil had carrots which were nowhere to be found. Unless they were mashed in, in which case, they were nowhere to be tasted regardless. The lentil soup was essentially \"daal\" (if you're South Asian, you know!) so avoid that if you're South Asian like I am and have that at home in your yogurt containers in the fridge (little bit of an inside joke there). So I had high expectations for the lentil soup but in the end, nothing special. My sister also ordered Yalanji which never showed up until mid-way through our meal when we called the server and he went to the kitchen to ask. Turns out, they were out of it - meaning their food isn't fresh, but pre-cooked. The mains are what really let us down the most! Especially my sister. She got a meat kebab of sorts. We didn't expect GIGANTIC portions, but neither did we expect that tiny of a portion. On a sad looking lonesome, soggy pita sat one lone (and small!) kebab. If it was one BIG or even a feasible kebab, trust me, I would not be bitching about it as much. But it was TINY! With my sister being coy and not wanting to bother anybody or speak up about it, much to my dismay, she accepted her fate and dug in. It was actually depressing! We all ended up sharing our platters with her and even then, we had to drive her to a nearby place to grab some food and drink. One of the biggest signs of poor dining, when you leave starving. Fix up!  As for myself, I ordered the chicken escalope with french fries and a \"salad.\" Salad being in quotes because I literally got a spoon of parsley/coriander with four measly pomegranates on top next to it. The escalope (breaded chicken essentially) was more than forgettable and I've never had something more bland. No pita with it. Nothing. Huge, huge, huge disappointment for what you're paying. The sauces that were provided were afterthoughts, mere spoonfuls shoved in to a tiny container that was gone within seconds - not because it was delicious, but because it was barely in there.   Service was good at the start. Then it got annoying as we were being watched & constantly badgered while we ate. The server kept coming to pick up plates WHILE we were still eating, and had the audacity to ask if everything was good afterwards. Got ready to finish a soup and it was gone! Not only did the server keep roaming around like a fly but also the manager. Probably because we weren't locals neither were we Arab? We stuck out like a sore thumb.  Looking back at the photos of other reviewers, we were better off sticking to the appetizers and teas because those were bigger and looked a hundred times more filling than the actual entrees which were a waste of money. Wanted to love this place but leaving with a horribly bitter taste in my mouth...and not from the Arabic coffee! It gets a one lonely star from me"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a while but was extremely disappointed. The chicken was extremely bland and dry. The rice was extremely oily.  Was not impressed at all and on top of that the customer service was extremely poor. However if you want to go to the restaurant for their interior then I will give them credits for that they have done a nice job with it but other then that would definitely not be going back. I'd rather go to paramount. This place was extremely overly priced and definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"Delicious. I love middle eastern food though, so maybe I'm a bit biased, but this place was delicious. The restaurant itself is quite nicely decorated - good atmosphere and they play nice, traditional music.  We ordered a lot of food! Between the three of us, we ordered: - fatoush salad - mixed grill platter  - vine leaves - babaghanoush - sausage and cheese bread - zaatar labneh pizza  Everything was great, but my favourites were the sausage cheese rolled bread, the zaatar labneh pizza, the the minced lamb kebabs in the mixed grill platter. They were all full of flavour and complimented each other well.  Prices are quite good too. Would come back again."}
{"text":"Beautiful setting and decor. Not crammed Like most Arabic spots. Service was excellent, staff are very friendly and attentive. Most of the food was very good. Didn't really car much for the Fatoush and Yalanji. Otherwise everything was great. will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"So I decided to try Roman Zaman today with a few friends I have invited to Mississauga to have lunch as they were looking for a Middle Eastern experience. I wanted to try something new so this was a perfect chance to take them somewhere where I would be able to try something new as well.  My review strictly in relation to other middle eastern experiences in Mississauga and heres my breakdown,  Pros - great location with lots of parking - very clean restaurant with an amazing syrian ambiance  - Amazing Falafel, Hummus with meat, Tabouleh, and baked items such as cheese and meat manaeesh, shish tawooq - Exceptional custard and mhalbeeyeh puddings for dessert - great arabic coffee and tea - customer service was relatively exceptional they were very friendly and warm however, they seemed staffed appropriately and I can tell they struggled a bit when it got busy but still manageable. -My non arabic friends loved it start to finish  Cons - I found it noticeably pricer than other middle eastern restaurants in Mississauga who offer the same kind of food - The fries: hey it came with the chicken tawooq, but might as well remove it from menu.  I would rate my overall experience here 9/10 and would have probably given it a 10 if it wasn't for the pricing. I really hope this place maintains their quality of food and service so they don't end up like other arabic restaurants that start up so well and then fall apart."}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful inside so I would give it 5 stars for the ambiance but that's the only thing that deserves 5 stars. Food was just mediocre, not the worst but not the best either. We ordered quite a few things to share so I tried few different things but I forgot half the things we ate already and I only went last night so that just shows how memorable the experience was!   The worst thing about this place was the customer service, place was busy so I keep giving servers the benefit of the doubt but they were just plain terrible! Our server was either tired or bored, she completely seemed out of it. She was walking around lazily staring in space, (weird!) never came to ask us if we needed anything and keep forgetting to bring us things we requested. When we tried asking another server for cutlery, he just said I will get you your server and walked away and we ended up waiting another 10 mins for our bored server to bring us forks..  All in all, we won't be returning to eat expensive mediocre food in a beautiful restaurant with bad customer service.."}
{"text":"Huge portions, lovely interior, and yummy food.  Initially i thought the prices were too pricey, but after recivieing my food i there was no way i can complain about the price given the enormous pile of shwarma that sat in front of me. We first ordered the potatoes and they are fantastic! Crispy on the outside, but hot and soft on the inside, and seasoned perfectly.   Next we ordered some shwarma platters and they were XXL. i gotta say that the chicken shwarma was miles better than the beef, but overall the shwarma dish lacked flavor and was rather bland.   They also gave us flavored rice and this sweet bread on the side, and they were probably my favorite lol...i liked them much more than my shwarma.   If my review was based purely on the shwarma it wouldnt land more than 3* but the potatoes, sides, and portions were really something else!"}
{"text":"Venue - Loved the venue, interior is beautifully decorated with a cozy Arabic feel.    Service - While there doesn't seem to be much structure (asked several times if we were being served by different servers), they were very accommodating, willing to explain every dish and offered to heat my dish even though it is typically served cold :) (I was freezing)   Food - Very good! I had the fattet hummos with yogurt ($7.99). It was a large bowl filled with a delicious blend of whole chickpeas and pita bread pieces in a tahini/yogurt base and topped with a few pomegranate seeds. They even offered to heat it up for me even though it's typically served cold.  **This dish is also typically only served on weekends at Paramount, so it was great that they offered as a regular menu item.  Friend had the fattoush salad and falafel, both really good!   Prices - not bad, I think they went up by about a dollar on every dish.   Would return again!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a great addition to our neighborhood. Great atmosphere, friendly and fast service, very fresh ingredients with a wonderful mix of spices. To top it all off the the kinafi is amazing! I highly recommend this place!! Everything we had was great! They even have USB ports at all their tables!"}
{"text":"So we went there on a Saturday.  For starters we ordered the sausage which was too dry. Shawermas very extremely dry as well. The mixed grill has no taste at all. All the meat was hard . Its really overpriced restaurant."}
{"text":"IF YOU ARE FASTING AVOID IFTAR HERE ...Worst iftar experience ever..... We went there for the iftar buffet the main dish was what looked like Mandi and yogurt kebbeh .... The lamb was under cooked and the yogurt for kebbeh was tasteless ... the kebab, Shish tawook and shawarma sides were also cold .... Maybe they are ok outside Ramadan .... But I will never recommend it for iftar to anyone... And yeah we ended paying 50$ per person including tax and tipfor a sub par food and we had to go somewhere else to finish our iftar."}
{"text":"My friends and I went there for lunch to celebrate our friend's birthday.  All I can say, everything is excellent from food to service."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best hummus and mutabul plates i have ever had. Found the beef dry. Chicken shawarma grill is good - chicken was soft and tasty. Fatoush salad is also very tasty. I would have given this place a higher rating but the service is below standard. There's a short haired lady who has an attitude and probably a reason why I would hesitate in going back."}
{"text":"This was my second experience at Roman Zaman.  I went there the first time because of all the buzz I'd been hearing. The place itself is beautiful, the decor is gorgeous, and it has an overall very warm and inviting Middle Eastern flare to it.  That's probably as much compliment as I want to give them.  The first time, they sat us right by the door (we're not picky, so we didn't mind), but they almost forgot about us and took a long time to attend to us. Our food was very dry, and though there was a lot of it, there was almost no flavour.   The watermelon juice is very good however (which is why we returned for the second time).  This time it seemed as though they were in a rush to close up shop (we were there at 8:30pm on a Friday). Our waitress seemed to be in a rush to clear our meals and took some of our food away before we even got a chance to say we weren't done with it.   Giving this place 2 stars because of the ambience, decor, and the juice."}
{"text":"My first time there with friends. I absolutely LOVED it. The food was delicious, so much variety to choose from.  The presentation was exquisite, the staff was very friendly and prompt. I believe there was a manager/owner maybe,on the floor. He attended to all the customers by helping out. I was very impressed by that. I truly felt like our meal was fit for a Queen. As we were eating I was already planning when to come back. I highly recommend the lentil soup. I'm a vegetarian so I didn't feel like I had minimum choices I actually felt I had too many to choose from. Again I'll tell everyone how much I loved this restaurant!!!!! I can't wait to go again !"}
{"text":"The best middle eastern restaurant in the GTA. Everything we ordered was delicious, the staff was amazing and the interior decorations were spectacular."}
{"text":"Excellent food and decor. Went for brunch with a party of four during a weekday at 11:30am. It was our first time. Although we had reservations, there was no wait for walk-ins then. Lunch is when the establishment began getting busy. We ordered mint tea and numerous dishes; hummus, manakeesh; zaatar and cheese with meat and chicken, fatet lahmeh, saj: labaneh and fattoush salad. The salad was dressed with pomegranate and was delicious! I still have a craving for it. The owner came to our table to ask if all was good, which it was. Some reviews indicate the service is not up to speed. It is a new restaurant still, give it a chance (their food is really good! You won't be disappointed) and time to adjust. Despite their slow service at times, the servers do their best to accommodate. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been curious about this place ever since the sign went up a few months ago. Today, I finally had a chance to check it out. As I was sitting at the restaurant, I gave it a solid 3*, maybe even 3.5* in my mind. My rating kept changing towards the end of the day and right now, 8 hours after the meal, it's a ZERO (well, obviously it's 1 star because I can't give zero stars). Wanna find out why? Read on.  The restaurant is beautiful. There's no question about it. It's probably the nicest Middle Eastern restaurant in Mississauga (side note: GOOD, at least that 1 star is justified).  We came here on Monday, around 4:00 p.m. The restaurant was pretty much empty, with only one other table occupied. I must confirm what others have said before me: the service is really, really slow. Clearly, even if the place isn't busy. I have no idea how they handle busy dinner time (we were still there well after 5:00 p.m. when the dinner crowd showed up - that's how long it took to have late lunch there). I can definitely understand the other 1 star reviews. But I digress.  We ordered the mixed shawarma platter (chicken and beef), a chicken skewer and a ground beef skewer. It took a long time to get our food, so I was hoping I would't be let down. Both skewers were fine but nothing special. The chicken shawarma was good and tender (though too bland for my liking) and the beef shawarma was awful. You could actually SEE how terribly dry it was. You could probably choke while trying to swallow it. The only thing that was really good was the pita bread.   After we finished our meal, we waited for about half an hour to get our bill. 30 minutes I will never get back. Service seriously blows here. I doubt that any of the servers has ever worked at a restaurant. They all looked like they had no idea what they were doing the whole time we were there.  Anyway, we're still at 3ish* here.   Then my stomach started to feel heavy. And I wasn't the only one feeling this way. Mind you, we split one shawarma dish (basically half of it, since we skipped the super duper dry beef) and 2 small skewers (I only tried a little bit of both), so it's not like we just had a huge meal. It's now well past midnight and I still can't digest that friggin lunch. It keeps repeating on both of us. Ughh, so gross.   And this, Yelpers, is a story of how to lose 3 stars within 8 hours."}
{"text":"Rude Staff, bad customer service the guy who serve tables not welcoming with bossy attitude. I wait 10 min on door just to wait the waiter to guide me to my table , the food extremely bad I ordered chicken Shawerma plate  and the chicken was dry and cold  , the fries like junk   the prices is not reasonable compared with food quantity and quality  the order was Shawrema plate + chicken wrap + Salad and I paid 63$ !!!! I don't recommended to waste your money and time for this restaurant"}
{"text":"I came here on a weekday at 7 p.m.  The decor was nice. Even the servers were dressed up in traditional outfits.  Everything Was beautiful,  from the salad  serving dish to the knives and forks.   The food was slightly overpriced. Paid about $17 before tax for literally two handfuls of food; the fried kibbeh.  When you order some of the kebabs, its like $16 and the rice is not even included!! You can go to bamiyan kabob, and get two skewers, and salad. And the naan!    I had a cold appetizer, Muhammara, which was a pomegranate syrup mixture with bread crumbs. It tasted very bitter and I would not recommend it.  However because of the atmosphere, that's really what you're paying for. I would recommend this for a nice night out."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my husband. Firstly we waited for a little while because the two servers who were working thought it was better to hang out in the kitchen rather than serve their customers. Once our server finally arrived he was neither cordial nor accommodating which resulted in my husband asking him to call the manager. The manager decided not to come and because he was busy on his computer. Whereafter my husband approached the manager and asked him why he refused to come and deal with the complaint that we had. Instead of apologizing the manager in a pompous and highly disrespectful manner said he was too busy and had many other employees so he did not need to come and deal with every complaint that was raised by the customers! In the food industry not only is the customer always right but managers/owners have to be decent and need to have basic etiquette when dealing with their customers rather than being an absolute jerk. The food is no doubt good but if this is what one is supposed to expect from the owner/manager then it's definitely not worth eating. The manager needs to understand he is not living in the Middle East but in Canada and his attitude needs to definitely be kicked out the door if he wants to run this business successfully!"}
{"text":"Syrian food. This place is delicious and has a great variety of food that is very very close to authentic. The place is a bit pricey but their food and portions are totally worth it.   We have been here a few times now and every time had a great experience. The food was delicious every time and the service was good as well.   The decor and ambiance is quite nice and it gives you a homely feel but its a great date night restaurant at the same time."}
{"text":"If you are tired of eating at Paramount and looking for a change, then this is the place for you! However the portions are very small and the beef may not be the tastiest. Over all it's good the services tends to be slow and they definitely have some rude staff. The decor is what the owner spent a lot on, perhaps they step up a little with their service"}
{"text":"We prefer the traditional dinners which are not on the menu. They can pretty much cook up anything traditional for you. this is one of our highly preferred establishments that resembles cookeries back home. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"I came here with my family and we all ordered different things: chicken and beef shawarma, mixed grill (chicken and beef skewers) , rice, fries,  humus, baba ganoush, steak, rice pudding and kanafeh. Everything was just delicious!  I have to say that the shish toukeh was the best item. The marinate was full of favour and the chicken was cooked till perfection: juicy! The eggplant dip had a smokey flavour which my family really enjoyed. The pita bread that they served on the side was warm and perfect.  The pudding had such a warm vanilla flavour and the kanafeh was the prefect mix of sweet and salty.  The price is well worth the food and service is excellent. The ambience is very cultural and the brass glasses give you a complete experience. Me and my family will surely spread the word and come back to this gem!"}
{"text":"As an Arab, I'm pretty critical about the Arabic food I eat. From the ambiance to the decor to the food to the device- every bite was more incredible than the last!  YUMMM"}
{"text":"I visit this place rarely . But each time i visit , it has never disappointed me . First let us talk about the ambiance , Its a thumbs up when it comes to the ambiance , they have designed it well and it has been maintained well . Gives a feeling that u step into a totally different country when u enter. Every time i have went, it was always crowded and had to wait for 15- 20 minutes to get seated . Its good for family crowd . Coming to the discussion of food , i love Mediterranean food in general for the flavor and the way it is being cooked . This place claims to be a damascene cuisine which i have never tired before and most of the dishes had pomegranate molasses in it and they taste so good . For anyone who is trying this for the first time ,most of the items from the menu are the same as a regular arabian restaurant . Shawarma , Kabob etc , Saj  (equivalent of Manakeesh ) are the ones i have tried and they were always made fresh and probably slow cooked so it would contain a lot of flavor . My wife loves the rice they serve , so full of flavor and topped with some fried nuts .I have always settled for either the grill plate or the shawarma plate and the fact they serve unlimited pita bread is what i call as being in paradise ( i just love the pita bread , meat , salad and the finger licking tahini and garlic sauce ) . Typing this makes me wanna go there , might plan to have dinner there tonight !! Anyone s around at the same time , gimme a shout ."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant with amazing food. The ambiance is elegant yet still informal enough to maintain its family feel. The portions are generous yet so fresh and tasty that you feel very satisfied. Coffee and cardamom tea are authentic and served beautifully. I recommend the signature salads and the appetizers. The mixed grill is deliciously seasoned and a great way to try different things. The food is meant to be shared, making it a great spot for a meeting or date.  A hidden gem in Mississauga."}
{"text":"The decor is beautiful.   The arayes was thicker than it ought to be. The muttabal was salty but had a good consistency. The pitas were fluffy and delicious. On the platter, the beef kafta kebabs were great. The chicken was okay but the lamb was dry. The cheese saj was tasty but again the pita was to thick.  The staff needs better training, most unfriendly."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. Really different from most Arab restaurants. The servers were weird tho. They kept staring at us and it made for a very awkward meal. We ordered chill potatoes for starters. A little salty and garlicky for our liking but delicious nonetheless. We also got the Roman Zaman Grills and the Chicken Escalope which was really good."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! The service is quick except when you're done eating and they need to pick up the plates, then you'll be sitting with your dirty plates for like half an hour"}
