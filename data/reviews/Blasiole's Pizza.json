{"text":"The chicken and jojos are very good but the two times I tried their pizza I was very disappointed. It was so dry  it was hard to tell which was the pizza and which was the box."}
{"text":"The chicken is crisp and delicious, the pizza was very good as well. They deliver to area camp grounds or have a really cute diner style atmosphere inside. Reasonable prizes and kid friendly. Locally owned family place, so worth trying. The family side salad was also well sized for the money!"}
{"text":"I ordered a ravioli with no meat . Being a vegetarian for 24 years I am very specific when I order out knowing that being an Italian restaurant there is a possibility of meat in the food . I was assured there was no meat in the sauce before I ordered , that it can be meatless sauce. It took 50 minutes for the order , which is fine because , I was told it might be an hour and fifteen minutes for the delivery. The order came with meat balls on the ravioli. I called and was offered a refund or to have the correct order sent out. Being hungry , I said to bring out the correct order,  they brought another ravioli out, with no charge. The second order also had meat in the sauce . No meatballs ... But meat in the sauce. I of course called and notified the manager. He said he took the second order and put no meat in the sauce. There was clearly meat in both orders. Having an order sent incorrectly both times and then the manager tell me that he personally made the order is disturbing. I normally would recommend eating here but I can not honestly recommend this restaurant to anyone unless they don't care about food quality. If you are okay with not knowing what is in your food then I would recommend blasiole's. I would give no stars but I have to give at least one for a post."}
{"text":"Wonderful chicken, jojo's and pizza!  Our favorite is their veal parm dinner - always delicious and tender with plenty of pasta of your choice.  Service is great and have never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"i wanted to update the review i wrote above.  it is now february 2015.  i have bumped my rating up from no stars/one star to two stars even though i have yet been able to try the food.  why?  they have finally gotten their act together to get a website up and running, and, they now have a menu as well.    these two requirements for having a business in today's world will facilitate me dropping in maybe when i am in the neighborhood and actually sample some food.  what a concept!    i did drive by on 2/1/2015 superbowl afternoon and the parking lot was jammed.  things may be looking up here....stay tuned"}
{"text":"We just moved back up from Florida, but I'm originally from Ohio and the husband is from NJ. I lived in NJ with him for 16 years, so I'm familiar with good NYC pizza.  We went into Blasiole's after being referred there by people at his new job. There was no one in the parking lot at lunch time on a Saturday, so we didn't even know they were open. When he found the door unlocked, we scooted inside and were told the dining room was closed as the heat was off. We could order takeout, but that was it.   The guy working the register told us how great their pizza was, but when we said we knew good thin NYC pizza, he balked. Then he said, \"Well, it's good for thin Ohio pizza.\" No, it's not.   We got a large pizza with mushrooms and green peppers. He said he'd give us a \"deal\" but it came out to the same price as a large pizza with 2 toppings. We waited in the freezing foyer for 15 minutes while the 3 people working talked about friends and sports right inside the kitchen doors, then we were handed the pizza and left alone in the foyer.  We live 2 minutes from there, literally, but it wasn't really even warm when we got home. The cheese was hardly melted in some spots. The sauce was only slightly bitter, which wasn't too bad, but it had way too much seasoning it.   The crust was comparable to Pizza Hut's pan pizza. How is that thin? I like a thicker chewy crust, but the husband does not, and he was less than impressed. As a matter of fact, he's the pizza lover and he only had 2 slices out of the entire pie. I had to spread the leftovers out over a few days so we didn't end up wasting all that money. But boy, did I doctor that sucker up each time so it was better than we received it.   I wouldn't go back again, nor would I recommend it, even for lovers of \"Ohio pizza\"!"}
{"text":"Pizza looked great until I bit into it.  Way too much sauce on pizza. It was messy and sloppy to eat. Could not hold pizza in hand as it just falls apart. Hard to taste the ingredients with all the sauce. If you like lots of sauce and messy pizza then look no further. Interesting to get a comment about ones review. No the sauce did not taste good. No I could not enjoy the crust because my pizza was soggy from all the sauce.  Why is my rating unfair?  It is in fact MY review and again it was the worse pizza that I and my family tasted in OUR opinion.  Nothing you can do for us to try this pizza again. Sorry you did not like my review"}
{"text":"Blasiole's...this pains me to do this but I'm dropping you to one star...and I think you were once at 5 with me!  Today's experience really left me sad though since you're the best pizza in the 'Boro!  I place an order online at 6:44pm.  It tells me to expect my pizza at 7:27pm.  I call at 7:42pm and I'm told that due to road closures the driver had to go a different route.  Taking the bypass around 303 only adds about 45 seconds...90 seconds at most!  I call again at 7:58pm since it's over a half hour beyond my quoted time and while on hold the pizza arrives at 8pm.  When the woman comes back on the line I tell her it's arrived but barely warm.  She made excuses about the online system automatically saying 45 minutes but when people call in they say an hour.  Regardless, it was still late.    Customer service 101: The first thing to always say is \"I'm sorry\".  Don't make excuses, just say you're sorry.  Fix the computer system and have it quote an hour then if it's problematic."}
{"text":"I forgot about this place until recently and it was as delicious as I remembered.  Great food..great service..big portions..and the bread is to die for"}
{"text":"I stopped in Streetsboro for the night and happened to find Blasiole's.  I'm glad I gave them a try.  Family restaurant, no frills, self serve soft drinks, no alcohol there.  They delivered fresh, warm bread to the table even with our pizza order.  When the kitchen made the wrong pizza on a busy night, the server let us know what happened, apologized, and discounted our bill.  Very honest!  The pizza was great, with fresh veggies, a wonderful crust, and a good sauce."}
{"text":"Immediately after my lousy order, I received s survey from Blasioles. I told them exactly what  I thought of my inedible sandwich. That was 2 weeks ago. Haven't heard a word."}
{"text":"Had the same order but this time got a large 3 topping with an extra turn. That pizza ain't bad."}
{"text":"Blasioles of Hudson is 10x's better than the one in Streetsboro. The owner is a young man who worked at the one in Streetsboro for 8 years and he's there everyday making sure the orders are on point unlike Streetsboro. The one in Streetsboro has a lot of teenagers who just don't care about the quality of food. Give Blasioles of Hudson a try if your in the area. It's right next door to Johnnys diner. My husband now prefers this one over Antonio's in Macedonia. Plus, Blasioles it's much cheaper than Antonio's and they aren't skimpy on the toppings."}
{"text":"Had a coupon and had never heard of this restaurant before so we gave it a try.  Sure glad we discovered it.  Casual restaurant, wide selection on the menu from sandwiches to pizza to Italian entrees.  Reasonable prices and very, very good food.  Loved the lasagna.  My husband had ravioli and said it was very good as well.  We added side salads - nice - came with black olives, cheese, wide range of dressings.  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Very friendly! The wings were huge! They were out of lasagna at dinner hour on Saturday...I'll be back to try other foods!"}
{"text":"I am not one to write poor reviews, unless that are absolutely necessary. I'm this case it is.   I placed an order, just over $300, for a luncheon following a funeral. I placed my order 3 days in advance, only 24 hours is requested. The women who took my order was slightly rude, but I did not complain. My dad, who passed, loved Blasiole's and I wanted his luncheon to be something he would have enjoyed.   The food was scheduled to be delivered at 3pm. We tried to call and get it delivered 30 mins early, we couldn't be exactly sure how long the burial service would last. They said they couldn't deliver early, we understood. Our order then arrived 10 mins late.   The delivery driver left behind the warmer used to transport and had to return later and pick it up. Our deluxe pizza was under cooked and they also forgot to deliver the coleslaw we ordered and paid for. I wasn't able to immediately call because I was tending to my grieving mother and all the other details, cleaning the hall, transporting flowers, etc etc.  When I called the very next day, I was greeted by an inexperienced manager. After politely explaining the issues I experienced the man abruptly told me I can't get a refund after 24 hours. I wasn't asking for a refund. The coleslaw I did not receive was about $5 of our large party order. I simply wanted to inform them of our issues so they could provide better service to those calling in the future.   This was the worst customer service I have ever received from a \"catering\" service. Needless to say, myself nor my guests will be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Are you looking to explore a restaurant that has pizza and much more?...Then head to Blasiole's Pizza..this is an excellent  neighborhood spot with delicious food for all your weekend pic-nic needs....or week day cravings for pizza, wings and more...expect great hot food..reasonable prices...good eating...I love this place!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Estimated delivery time was right on! Would eat there again!"}
{"text":"It's your standard pizza/fried chicken/Italian joint. Nothing fancy or anything, but we had a good experience dining in. It was seat yourself, and get your own drinks. The one waitress was nice, and did a good job.   We had a $20 Groupon for  Dine-In Only,  and got a ton of food with that. They bring out complimentary warm bread, which is a good touch. The lasagna had a sweet sauce and was decent. My wife really liked the fried chicken breading. I think the pizza was the overall winner, I would come back for it. I liked the sauce and the crust."}
{"text":"Great value great food dine in carry out and catering chicken always a big hit for our annual 4th of july parties  Its local, reasonable and good food."}
{"text":"The pizza was delish! I have never been here but was craving pizza and I found a gold mine!!! The staff was friendly. The boneless wings were ok but the pizza was the bomb! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Moved to the area recently and was looking for good, local pizza. Tried this place out. Family owned, which I like, but the service seemed to lack enthusiasm. The single large pizza I ordered was prepared in a reasonable amount of time and I took it home. It was plenty hot when I returned home, and that's great. The problem is.. it wasn't very good. The sauce was dull, the crust struck me as generic, and the quality of toppings didn't blow my mind. I'd put it on par with Papa John's, and  that's not necessarily a compliment."}
{"text":"Good pizza and sandwiches, delivery was a bit slow but I still order regularly."}
{"text":"I love this place for Chicken and potato wedges (fries?) I've never actually had the pizza because we always get a bunch of chicken and potatoes because the chicken is so good! It's moist, crunchy and flavorful. We always get the combo with coleslaw and salad. The coleslaw is good, chopped pretty fine, and the salad is typical iceberg pizzeria salad with dressing packets and lots of mozzarella cheese on top."}
