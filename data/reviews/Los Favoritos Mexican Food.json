{"text":"We always enjoy the food although the staff is not very friendly.  It is still worth repeat visits."}
{"text":"They have the best Machaca burrito I've ever had! The burritos seem bigger too in length compared to other Mexican food shops. Enchilada combo is great and plentiful too."}
{"text":"I'll make this brief. 

I LOVE Los Favs!! ...with the exception of this location. I placed a to-go order and the girl was very nice both over the phone and in person. Also, the order was ready when I arrived! Those are the 2 stars.
-1 star for the foul odor that pierced my nostrils as I opened the door. Based on that smell alone, I wouldn't recommend ordering any meat or seafood based products from here.
-1 star for the \"horchata\" that had a reddish color...it tasted like an Arnold Palmer made up of horchata mix and jamaica, no thanks.
-1 star for the extremely hard and unusual mass found in my chili relleno burrito. That's right, I had a vegetarian burrito but there was something as hard as a bone about the size of their sauce container (see picture) right in the middle of it. Like a chicken wing that had been deep fried for too long and the meat was fused to the bone. 

So much for eating lunch today :/"}
{"text":"OK place.  They seem to trim the meat or at least cook it enough that there's no fat...which is great for me since nothing turns me off more than getting a mouthful of fat.  Ick!  Anyways, tried several different tacos and I would definitely go back for the ground beef taco which was pretty good. Some tacos are fried and others are not..kind of weird that they don't let you know which..the carne asada and carnitas are soft tacos and included guacamole that was more of a blended sauce..but decently thick sauce and include tomatoes.  The ground beef and chicken are fried and do not include guacamole or tomatoes.  The chicken was good but mega salty.  Although, it did have green peppers and onions in it which was a nice touch.  Maybe it would be good in a burrito to soak up all that salt.  The pork was very rich..too rich for me.  The carne asada was good but it had a very beefy flavor if you know what I mean..kind of like cheap beef has.  So, I would definitely go back in a pinch when I'm desparate and hugry.  Better than taco bell and filibertos but not the best place.  My favorite mexican fast food place at the moment is in the food court at fiesta mall.  Oh, also the drive through is located on the side street next to Discount Tire.  Just turn there and go a little farther down the block till you see the gap in the wall for the drive thru past the entrance to the strip mall--the drive thru wasn't marked that I could see."}
{"text":"I could eat the Carne asada for the rest of my life. Say that the prices are fair for the most part but can get pricy if you have a large family when I have seen similar places it's a lot more competitive pricing. Very good food overall for any meal breakfast lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"I love the enchilada plate. The only thing is to wait takes forever but the food is good"}
{"text":"Arrived to order a shrimp from taco, and a steak taco. The steak taco came with guacamole , I asked that could be switched out for sour cream, however that would of incurred an additional charge..  the food lacked flavor, and the shrimp taco was nasty. DO NOT ORDER IT!  honestly 9.00 for 2 tacos is high. found this place hoping for a little shop with some authenticity and left feeling rather let down. was more like a burger King meets Chinese restaurant. ... in a Mexican joint"}
{"text":"Los Favoritos I consider the best mexican fast food. This one in particular is not as great as the one in scottsdale but I like it regardless. Better than filimuertos. The thing that I like the least is the salsas. They have not flavor. They should make them again like the one in scottsdale. The place is clean, the food is good all the time, costumer service could be better not that I have had a problem. Just keep cooking better than any other \"-bertos\" and I'll keep being a regular."}
{"text":"I've been her a few times and this review is more about the service I received which was very rude. Ordered through the drive thru and she apparently couldn't understand what I was saying so I drove up to the window. From their the rudeness started. Apparently she went and told the cook, who knows who he was, at which point she handed me the food and shut the window. As I looked in the window I see the guy mad dogging me, please!! Last time my family and I go here. Need to work on the staff."}
{"text":"Can never go wrong with the tacos or carne asada. Tacos and even the chips in the super nachos are always fresher and crunchier than any of the \"Beto's\"."}
{"text":"We have been going here for a couple of years now at first it was great the service was awesome, the food was good, but lately every time we go there we get rude people to serve us. The women that's always in the drive thru is beyond rude and treats you like crap. The food is either really bad or eh ok."}
{"text":"Their carne asada fries are to die for. I've never been disappointed by this place ever. It's a pretty standard Mexican fast food joint. Very basic inside and has a drive through. The food is the main draw to Los favs."}
{"text":"This location has gone down the drain. We have our office order from there weekly and they drop the ball more and more. They mislabel the food and forget burritos all the time. Then want to charge for hot sauce. SMH"}
{"text":"We love the breakfast burritos at Los Favs! Great place and great service"}
{"text":"Love love this place! Their food is always delicious and fresh made. If you go, absolutely try to carne asada fries! You will not be disappointed. 

Wait times are typically pretty quick to that of waiting on fresh food and the employees are super nice. I have never been there when it's too busy but I'm sure it can get busy because their food is so good!"}
{"text":"Best Breakfast burritos. If you have a lighter appetite or plan to go down the street for a donut at the 19th Donut Hole there is enough burrito to split one. My favorite is the chorizo burrito with some red sauce. My kids always get the bacon. Only downside is their popularity in the mornings. Drive through wait can be lengthy, don't go when you're in a rush."}
{"text":"Where do I start??? The cashier was very rude. The first time we came in was about a half hour before closing and she was so dang rude we actually left and went to burger King next door. My partner decided today he wanted care asada fries, so we opted to go in this time. Ughhh horrible! Same lady with her same rude attitude.! Note: if you hate ur job so much u may want to look for another one.! ....the food was bleh no taste and not to mention my carne asada burrito was nice cold in the inside. Like they are headed it Nd was a failed miss. Never again will I eat this food. Suck a bad experience I can opt for eating the bird crap outside in the sidewalk. So disappointed.!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in to try a bean, cheese, onion burrito as recommended by my MD. 
He is right...best beans in town...best burrito of this type I have ever eaten. I was in a rush, but will be back for sure to try more from the menu.
I highly recommend this establishment.
Clean and great counter service."}
{"text":"Pretty happy I didn't run into anyone I know here, considering this was a late morning after mill.....and I really just needed a burrito. I came here with a group of friends and service was fast and the California chicken burrito was exactly what I needed. Everyone left fat and happy. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Visited this place on Sunday 8/28 with my family while I was in town visiting. I love the atmosphere and the food is absolutely delicious. The service is great, as well. My family had the chicken/cheese quesadilla, carne asada nachos, california burrito, bacon breakfast burrito, and beef taquitos. I highly recommend the carne asada nachos; delicious!"}
{"text":"If you want quick, cheap and good Mexican food this is the place to go! Its very much like Filibertos. You have the option to buy a major item by itself (burrito, taco, etc) or you can choose one of their meal deals. They also have daily specials where you get a major item with extras for a discount! They offer and red and green sauce free of charge. 

  The restaurant is relatively clean and though it is small they have tables and booths to sit down and eat your meal. The only complaint I have is the first time I bought a burrito I didn't realize cheese wasn't included. So every time I go back I have to ask for cheese which is an additional cost. This place is nicely priced though so I will continue to come back here when I am craving me some Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Best Taco Tuesday Tacos ever!!!!  Seriously delicious and boy what a great value!!!!!  The chicken tacos were the best"}
{"text":"Los Favorites is amazing.  I eat at one a couple times a week, and it's just so much better food than other Mexican fast food. Most days I practice a diet of low carbs, low sugar, high fat, high protein, and you'd think that would be difficult, what with all the tortillas floating around and whatnot, but they still have quite a selection. 
Cleanliness is key, and this place ranks higher than most others that attempt top am reside in the same class. The food is exceptional, the best I've ever had at any Mexican fast food restaurant.  There is enough seating to take care care of the lunch hour traffic, but the whole restaurant is tucked in behind the discount you're, so if you're going to end up there, you've got to be looking for it.  Try it out today, and find out why they are blossoming as a company, and join the crowd that knows where to find the best Mexican food ;)"}
{"text":"Love Los fabs.  Priced well. Always friendly staff. Quick and easy. Always filling. I recommend highly."}
{"text":"My husband liked it. I thought it was just ok.
Nice people. Price was good.
There was a strong bleach smell when we walked in and it was hot."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food at Los Favoritos. They do make authentic street tacos that are some of the biggest ones that I have ever seen. For a light lunch 1 taco would be great. 2 tacos and you will have a substantial meal.  I will really have to try to steer my fellow foodies to the Carne Asada tacos, hmm hmm good ! 

The only drawback to Los Favoritos is a small one and is due to the fact that I like my salsa really hot. Their salsa is good but not strong enough to make my hair stand up. 

If you are ever in Mesa, stop in for some great tacos."}
{"text":"Good food. Be prepared to wait 30+ minutes in the drive thru. I'll rethink this for a \"quick stop\". If I was going to wait 30+ minutes I would have gone to a nice sit down restaurant.

Edited my review. After I received my order of three meals, there were 4 tiny salsas in the bag. Went back to get more. When I asked for more salsa the young girl was literally trying to just hand me two handfuls of salsa. I appreciate the effort, but common sense would suggest a bag. Staff needs help. I'll drive the extra miles for senior taco next time."}
{"text":"Open at 8am they say...we just went there at 8:04am and no one was there...not a sole in sight!  Pretty pissed off right now!  Other people waiting in the parking lot...not a good way to run a business."}
{"text":"This is the only spot where I'll pick up a good breakfast burrito or carne Asada burrito. I like to hit this place up during my lunch hour. I'm done with any place that ends with \"bertos\"...haha."}
{"text":"Los Fav does not disappoint for basic Mexican fast food. We like it better than most divey Mexican fast food around Mesa. This location is nice because they offer order ahead then just go thru the drive thru for fast service. 
I don't like their Horchata. But that's about it."}
{"text":"Nice staff, drive thru option available. This is a simple Mexican food place.
Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"5 Stars for their chorizo breakfast burrito!!! The best I have had! The cost compared to the size... money well spent! I have a hard time eating the whole thing in one sitting. I enjoy it with the green chili!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed with this place based on the previous reviews. I got the four rolled tacos special. The rolled tacos were flavorless and lacking meat. Guac was alright but not enough to help the flavor of the tacos. The beans were incredibly salty and I probably wouldn't have been able to eat them besides the fact that the rice was incredibly bland and eating them together balanced them out a tiny bit. I got the lemonade which was mediocre, but my friend who got the pineapple drink thought that it was so sweet she couldn't drink any of it."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Los Favs for years, and recently moved close to this one here in Mesa. Tonight I was craving my all time favorite, a carne asada burrito. When I arrived, it didn't seem busy at all. When I got home to take a bite out of my burrito, I could tell that my meat had been sitting there ALL day. They didn't even bother to make it fresh. The steak pieces were hard as rock and completely cold. This was hands down the most disappointing Los Favs burrito I've ever had. You would think if they aren't busy the least they could do is give you fresh ingredients. Not sure if I will ever visit this location again. Beyond disappointed."}
{"text":"Compared to the Tempe location, this Los Favs is more spacious with more of a sit-down feel. The menu is pretty much the same, with the same reasonable prices and big portions. 

I got the bacon breakfast burrito to go. It was made in only a few minutes and I was out the door in no time. I love getting red and green salsa to make it Christmas style and the lady at the front counter gave a good number of them to go with my big burrito.

The actual burrito was filled to the brim with nicely cooked potato cubes and a ton of crispy bacon. There was a little bit of cheese, and I could only taste a bit of the eggs since there were small bits of egg dispersed throughout it. Unfortunately I did get some unpleasant crunch from egg shell that wasn't removed when the eggs were cracked open.

Service was friendly and the location is fairly easy to find, right behind the Discount Tire. The price of the burrito with tax was a little under $5. 

Overall, 3.5/5."}
{"text":"Well, I'll have to agree with the foul smell which I attribute to seafood?  But I'm just not really much of a seafood guy.
That said, their breakfast burritos here are awesome! The only other type of burrito I've ever had here is the Arizona burrito. Other than that it's really just my place to go and I'm getting tires at discount. I've always been happy with the food."}
{"text":"Oh, the inhumanity....most would think I'm on \"that time of the month\" roll. Nope, just crappy happenings and why we stick to what we love instead of unfortunately trying new things. This place flat out sucks. I order through the drive thru, The whole time I am talking/ordering I have to talk over a crying infant...oh folks, not my infant (don't/wont have one), I mean the one attached to the order taker chick's hip. LMAO. I at first thought, eh, whatever, some derelict brought their kid in and it's all in the background at the counter ordering themselves ..WRONG... Rudest person ever has a terrible excuse of a four limbed piece of DNA and blood cells attached to her overly large hip, this crying non-walk of life is so important she can't do her job. Pay attention to your life and it's bringings first please and mentally map out the idea that a babysitter may be a wiser alternative to you dragging your own life source in such a wretched, unwanted most positively unplanned term of food stamps and our taxes into this world...I mean, super glad you are teaching your child work ethics but come on, do your job.  I ordered, waited, was ignored and ghastly baby momma holding infant on the hip chick never acknowledged me (like seven minutes but seemed like eternity for a drive-thru) I finally drove away....no food, no dinner and no love from or to Los Favoritos."}
{"text":"Staff sucks, just plan rude the older lady has such an attitude. Food was blah, nothing  special about it. Won't be going here anymore."}
{"text":"Los favs has great food for a reasonable price. My favorite Mexican spot in Mesa currently. The problem with this location is the customer service is trash. Every cashier I've encountered since visiting this place for over a year now has been unfriendly, no smiles, bothered when you ask for \"all green\" or \"extra salsa\" they slam the window & don't ever inform you of anything. They shouldn't make the ordering experience so uncomfortable. I'm 5 mins away & would rather go to the one off Mesa dr & Guadalupe."}
{"text":"Called to order pick up, had to repeat order 3 times, the girl on the phone was rude, when a co worker went to go pick up the order, she lectured her and said how she need to be more specific when we order. No customer should even be treated that way."}
{"text":"This place, I gotta say, is quite the hidden gem. The food, I think, is excellent. I got myself a Carne Asada burrito and it was very flavorful (although I will say the pico de gallo needed a little more kick, but the excellent guacamole made up for that).

The only thing I can see wrong with it, really, is the fact that it IS hidden. It is located behind Discount Tire and is easily overlooked (it's the last business on the left in the plaza). I believe they have other locations around, but this one is right around the block from me. No one really goes there, though, and is usually empty unfortunately. If it was in a better location, it would probably pick up a customer base.

With that said, I only tried this place because a few months ago, I was getting my new rear tires mounted and balanced at Discount, and one of their workers stopped by Los Favoritos and picked up some lunch. As he walked by, the aroma hit me. It smelled awesome and I wanted to try it.

Since my brother's tire went flat yesterday, we went to get him a new one, and while waiting, I suggested we stop by for lunch. It's not the best looking restaurant by any means, but I don't go to those for appearance (Mickey's Hot Dogs by downtown Mesa is another prime example of good food, bad location, and underwhelming aesthetics). It's all about the quality of food, and this place is excellent as far as that goes. I'd like to go there again and try something else!

Also, there are other restaurants called Los Favoritos Taco Shop. Are those part of the same chain or something, or completely independent? Having never been to one other than today, I can't say for sure. Since every location for every business runs completely different than the, next, though, just refer to this review for this particular location, since I can't speak for any other potential ones."}
{"text":"the morning staff is so horrible and rude. they kept messing up my order and on the third time coming back to get it right they said \"what now?\"  then told me \"the chef said he will never make this again\" all for asking no meat no cheese! like really! really sucks because i loved them and i feel betrayed"}
{"text":"I loved the Los Favoritos location in Scottsdale and since we moved to Mesa, I was happy to know that there was a new location close by. I've been such a fan of their California burritos and my hubby's favorite is their crunchy beef tacos. They have reasonable prices and such a great selection of tasty Mexican food. 
Tip - Call ahead and order your food before you arrive. Therefore, you do not have to wait 20+ minutes for your meal."}
