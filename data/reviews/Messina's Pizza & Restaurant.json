{"text":"The 16 cut Sicilian pizza is the best around and a great price.  My only complaint is that they need to get another oven.  Often when I call there's a wait of as much as an hour for a pizza.   Although the Sicilian is incredible, I'm not a fan of the round pizza.  Most people I know agree."}
{"text":"If you live in Gibsonia/Allison Park area and Messina's isn't your \"go to\" spot for pizza/hoagies then there's something wrong with you! They have the best DEALS and the best FLAVOR. The most bang for your buck! There's definitely a wait sometimes but isn't that a sign that it is as good as I'm talking it up to be...? They offer a great sicilian pie but the regular round pie ain't too shabby either. If you're into the white pizza scene they have what you're looking for. And don't even get me started on hoagies... TO DIE FOR! Italian subs like you wouldn't believe. Homemade meatball hoagies with homemade meatballs made by Frank (the owner), himself. Try the breadsticks for a fantastic garlicy bready goodness. Long review short... Messina's is the place to go for pizza, hoagies, apps, and munchies if you're in the Allison Park/Gibsonia/Hampton Twp./ Deer Lakes area."}
{"text":"Rude answering the phone. Don't accept credit cards. Tell customer they're wrong when order is incorrect."}
{"text":"Honestly I would give this 0-1/2 of a star. First I walk in and I smell onion rings (sorry but I think a pizza place should smell like pizza not onion rings)! So my family ordered a pizza and pepperoni rolls. It took 1 hour and 20 minutes! When my friend went to go ask what was taking so long, they said \"it's slowly coming out.\" And the cook rolled his eyes! They lady at the counter in charge of the register, mumbled, \"it hasn't been an hour.\" Yes it has! I would NOT recommend coming here. The food was okay."}
{"text":"The regular pizza is good but Messina's Sicilian Pizza is where it's at.  They have the best Sicilian around.. hands down.  Their sandwiches are very, very good.  Their wings only come in two flavors, mild and BBQ but the price is great for the large order you get."}
{"text":"The pepperoni pizza is wonderful! Delicious sauce, great crust... The perfect pizza! Delivered hot to my house. I'll definitely order from Messina's again."}
{"text":"Meh ?!  Just meh. Crust sauce and cheese.
And nah, not again. Yinz git it ? You know what I mean - this pizza met the minimum requirements in pizza school."}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars if possible. Absolutely one of the worst pizza's we've ever had. Skimpy, thin, odd tasting brown, (not red) sauce. The only thing worse than the pizza was the disgusting bathroom. Geez, owner, spend a few hours in there with a pressure washer and remove the decade old grime in every corner. Then maybe drop a few bucks and freshen it up. Any higher ratings must have come from local, former (or current) stoners or country folks more accustomed to going to a feed mill or gas station."}
{"text":"Super affordable meals.  Good pasta dinners, pizza, and wings.  I order here all the time when I don't want to cook."}
{"text":"Pretty plain, Nothing fancy, its food.   No credit card reader, wtf?  Staff were nice, but disconnected.  Need food, they got you, but if you're looking for pizza, keep walking."}
{"text":"Went to dine in and waited 1 hour and 20 min for our pizza. I went up to the counter at the 1 hour mark and was told \"it's slowly coming out\". We then asked for it to go and then the cook rolled his eyes I guess not knowing I was still standing there. If you ever want to eat here, maybe ask how long you will have to wait. Completely annoyed!"}
{"text":"Yummy. New to the area we finally found a great pizza place. I highly reccomend you go and try the pizza and wings. We also got the antipasta. Wings were a great price for 16. And the were big and meaty just how i like them. The white pizza was great too. Staff are friendly looks and smels like a pizza place how its supposed to be. It took us to go to three other places before finding this one and so glad we did. Thank you messinas for a great dinner."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the Allison Park area. Thin crisp crust, great sauce, nice blend of cheeses.   Quality toppings. The Italian hoagie is really good as well. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"For a takeout place, it was okay.  I would never go and eat there again as an eat in.  We took the kids, it was SOOOOOOO SLOW.  When we finally got our food, it was okay.  The place is older, run down... the people were nice enough."}
{"text":"We ordered a chicken ranch pizza and a whole steak hoagie. The pizza was just ok do to the chicken being extremely over cooked. Making it dry. The ranch sauce was very good and so was the crust. Without the chicken it would have been good. The steak hoagie was pretty decent. The steak was seasoned well and the bread they use is great. Overall I would say give them a try as the only negative I encountered was the chicken and that obviously isn't a good representation of the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"A great place to order Pizza and subs. Never had an issue with the food. We order from here 1-2 times a month.    Use to get delivery, seems to take too long.  We just pick up now and no problems.  Staff is very nice.  They do not accept plastic.  Cash or check only."}
{"text":"Best local pizza place around with great food. Locally owned too,  homemade non-generic box brand pizza. The wings to the hoagies the the specialty food like gyros are fantastic. Not to mention the prices are unbeatable. 5 stars hands down. People need to quit going to this stupid big box chain pizza places with crap pizza and no soul. Messinas has soul, and the family runs the business with their heart and great recipes."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. Tastes like good, homemade pizza. The wings are also excellent. The only order I have ever been displeased with is the roast beef sub. The roast beef is dry and tasteless. But don't let that stear you away. Everything else is amazing."}
{"text":"told me 45-60 minutes for small order, went there in 60 minutes , told another 25. did not care, said nothing, no apology. food is ok, service is terrible."}
