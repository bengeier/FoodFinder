{"text":"Love this place! A small town relaxed feel. Friendly staff, good food, and the fish on Fridays is fabulous not to mention affordable at under $8. They bring in great musical talent as well. Definitely one to put on your list!"}
{"text":"JP's is a great place run by fantastic people. My favorites on the menu are the wings (Tuesdays), and the pork tenderloin which  is huge, homemade and delicious. They also have great live music most Thursdays and on the weekend too!"}
{"text":"Fish and fries on Friday were good. A lot of food for the money. Typical fare for rural Illinois bar and grill."}
