{"text":"3.5 if I could give it. The food is truly french through and through. Fleur De Sel is an experience I am glad I tried but I don't think I will be back again. The hit to the wallet alone makes my legs shake a little. 

Patience is a virtue as the kitchen takes its time to prepare the meals but the end product is delicious and screams France. 

The waiter we had was a little odd but I guess it is luck of the draw. He seemed nervous at the table and had a very interesting 80s curly hairdo. My dinner partner and I spent much of the meal mesmerized as his hair bobbed around the restaurant. 

I know this will sound odd but the washrooms are a pleasant surprise for both men and ladies. Just trust me on this, you will walk about with a smile on your face and a chuckle in your throat after visiting Fleur De Sel's unique facilities. 

On that note, bon voyage on your adventures at Fleur De Sel."}
{"text":"The duck pate was super delicious and the bison bourguignon was extremely flavorful & tender."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on a Saturday night.
This was my first time trying French cuisine and it was a wonderful experience! The server was helpful  and attentive. The food was absolutely amazing, everything was so fresh and well cooked. I had the salmon escalope with potatoes and veggies a must try!"}
{"text":"I was here on 01/28/2012, with 5 other guests. It wasn't my first choice, rather chosen by another who had been here on another occasion.
Throughout the night, 4 bottles of red wine were consumed, and a diet coke by me. I'm a non-alcoholic. Anyways lets get to the food. Appetizers that were ordered, consisted of this French Onion soup $12, Scallops (Bayonne,Rosemary), this is a salad with a vinaigrette Dressing accompanied with two medium sized scallops. $15,
The Entree's that were ordered that night, A couple orders of Rack of lamb $39, Beef tenderloin $39,a couple orders of Ahi Tuna $37, Grillled tenderloins of Ahi Tuna $37.
with 4 bottles of red wines averaging around $90.00 each. 
I can't speak for how the other meals tasted, but my scallops were quite tasty, I was just expecting more than two when they showed up to the table. As for the rack of lamb, it was very tender. If I was going to say anything negative at all about it, it's that the chops were a little on the fatty side. Also they could've put the hot mustard on the side of the dish, instead of the lamb right on top of the hot mustard.
My wife couldn't finish her Beef Tenderloin, so I tried a piece and It was like cutting through butter.
I have to agree with other reviews when it comes to price. Although I wasn't paying, I estimated with tip it was around $800.00 for 6 people.

Small restaurant, good service overall, in the old Tivolli stripmall for you Calgarian's out there."}
{"text":"Fleur de sel is one of Calgary's restaurant treasures.  As other reviewers point out, it really, sincerely feels like a bit of Paris transported to Southern Alberta. Unfortunately for us, we don't live in Calgary anymore, but whenever we visit, we always include dinner at Fleur de sel on the agenda. 

On our current visit we started with the spinach salad with goat cheese and crispy fried lardons, cubes of pancetta. For the mains my wife had the breast of duck in a beautiful red wine, star anise and rosemary reduction.  I went with the lamb chops.  The chops were perfectly done, and coated with a wonderful mustard glaze.

We were a but too full for desert, so I had mine in a glass: a glass of sauterne that was the perfect end to an excellent meal.

One final bit of advice.  For me, summer is a bit too warm to have the traditional cassoulet for dinner, but come winter, nothing staves off the cold, and warms the soul like this extraordinary dish.  Make sure to have it with the duck confit!  You will be very happy!"}
{"text":"A lovely dining experience. The food and the wine were exquisite!!! It was my first introduction to French cuisine and I hope it won't be my last."}
{"text":"Another delightful meal.  This restaurant never disappoints. The food was fresh, delicious and beautifully presented. And, the owner was charming, as always."}
{"text":"French bistro in the heart of Calgary. Authentic French cuisine with lots of character and charm. The owner, Patrice, has been running the place for 19 years with  remarkable consistency and supporting staff who provide additional personal charm.

The menu includes traditional French recipes with good wine selection (soup l'oignon, pate du conarde, steak au poivre, salad nicoise (fresh tuna), tarte tatin and cream brule."}
{"text":"Mergueses (sp?) sausage cooked in the cassoulet, HUGE white beans, lamb chops grilled and served on top, the sauce was excellent (see photo)

Very nice bread and olive oil for a $25 lunch"}
{"text":"I was in town for business and looking for a good French restaurant for dinner.  Decided to try out this place, based on the reviews and the menu.  I arrived early, and was quickly seated by the window by a very friendly waitress.  The inside is very cosy, and welcoming. Dimly lit with high ceilings, and a brick wall with bottles of wine lining it, I felt very much at home.

I decided to get a couple of appetizers instead of a large entree, and went with the Foie Gras and the Mussels.  This turned out to be a lot of food - really too much for one person.  The hot, fresh french bread was delicious - crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside, as it should be.  The foie gras was incredible - it's my favorite, and I'd had it earlier at another place that turned out to be a disappointment, so was happy that I got to have a great version of it here.

The mussels - there were so many of them!  They were tremendous - they tasted fresh as delicious!  The waitress recommended a Pinot Gris that I loved as well.  

For dessert, I finished the night off with the mini vanilla bean crème brûlée, which was divine!

I am back home and still dreaming about eating here.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Dinner at Fleur de Sel tonight.  AMAZING as always but tonight oh my god! So good!! Started off with Romain with roasted garlic and vinegrette and a side of this french fries they make that you would litterally sell you kids for! Then it was on to Chicken in a cream white wine sauce, pasta with BIG chunks of bacon and their signature veg!  I'm telling you, reasonably priced and top notch food and service!  It doesn't get better then this!"}
{"text":"The guy and I love French food and had booked with Fleur de Sel for a special occasion. As noted by others the place has a nice ambiance although definitely a little on the cramped side. 

For starters I had a green salad and the guy had the scallops, both were adequate but certainly nothing really special. I had duck as a main; the sauce was heavy and overpowering, duck was chewy, the vegetables overcooked and the lump of rice was less than inspired.  The guy had ostrich which he really enjoyed. 

We ordered a carafe of the house wine for $39.00 which looked to be 1/2 litre -  extremely over-priced. Food was slow to come, the service was even slower and the bill was high for food and wine that was marginal - we won't be returning.

On a high note the cramped atmosphere allowed us to get to know our neighbors and we had a great conversation with them."}
{"text":"Chose this place because it looked like an upscale French restaurant where I could bring my girlfriend for her birthday. Other reviews claimed that the service was shotty, but usually I take that with a grain of salt, so I gave this place a try.

Made a reservation and was seated right away - table set, menus ready, and water poured. Off to a great start. But that's where the service ended. 

Took ten minutes for our server to introduce herself and read us the specials. Often I would finish my water and wait another ten minutes to have it filled up. They were very informal in their language (after sitting with the dessert menu for a while and having my credit card on the table: \"are you having dessert?\" - very rushed and impolite). 

Granted, it was just the maitre d' and one waitress, so it was understandable that they were rushed, it certainly tarnished the atmosphere & \"upscale\" concept. 

Food was average, too. I had the scallops as an appetizer, she had the prawns. Cooked and tasted great, but served with a huge field green salad which took away from the presentation (if they were nicely presented around a smaller salad, it would have been much better). For dinner I had the pepper steak and it was way overcooked (but still tender), and the sides (veggies & roast potatoes) were simple. She had the French Onion Soup which was good, but nothing special. 

2/5 because poor service, poor food presentation, and average food. Maybe I had the wrong impression of this place, but still, not worth the $30-$40/entree price."}
{"text":"As I walked into this petite, french eatery, I can't help but noticing all the posters on the wall.  Apparently, they're original ad pieces from around the world.  The ambience was dim and romantic but also very chill and relaxed at the same time. I also noticed that they cater to a much older crowd. 
  
Our waiter was very tentative and introduced me to this enhancer that sweetens your wine.  It was the first time I ever heard or saw something like that.  It gives the white wine a little rose color and makes it a little more easier for all you non wine drinkers to swallow...hehe. 
I never tried fois gras before so I was anxious to finally try it out.  We also ordered one of my favorite, escargot.  The escargot were cooked with sauteed onions and sausages.  I'm not a fan of onions so the aroma ruined the escargot for me.  The fois gras on the other hand was splendid.  It's not just any pate I've tasted.  It had this intense flavor as it melts in your mouth like butter.  I must of ate  half if it!
The waiting time between our appetizer and main course was quite long so I wasn't too impressed.  My lamb dish finally arrived and it was well worth the wait.  The lamb was a little over cooked to my liking but yet the meat was still tender. I didn't enjoy the reduction sauce so much and the vegetables were just ok.
I had a piece of my friends duck because they were raving about it but I didn't enjoyed it so much.  I thought the meat was tough and chewy.  
Overall, the service was awesome and the food was quite tasty.  French settings are always so quiet and formal so this restaurant caught me off guard, for the better.   Comfort is the key to every meal so when you pair that with informative waiters, you get a very accommodating experience.  Definitely a place to come back."}
{"text":"It's just so impossibly *French* you know? 

The tight tables, the menu, the service - between the door and the curtain you walk through, I swear you get transported to France. I imagine some people love it here, some people hate it. I am in the category that love it. 

The food is always melt-in-your-mouth perfect. The wine list is good. The vibe is perfectly pitched. 

note: I've been told its a little uppity. I don't get the rude feeling like you do sometimes when you walk into a shoe store and the girls are snobby and you're like, \"but you sell shoes for a living???\" and leave in a confused haze, sans-shoes.  I think it's just...French. I say deal with it, I've never noticed and I'm quite sensitive to these things.

If you're looking to impress a woman (uhh...not really a girl, but you know, one of the grown-up ones) or to say I love you, or to spend a couple of hours with dear friends, this is where you want to be."}
{"text":"Fleur de Sel is a great place to go for a non-pretentious home cooked French meal. The food is excellent and the venue is tiny, just like something you would find on the street corner in Paris. 

Menu prices seem steep for a brasserie."}
{"text":"Great service and good food.. The place is very small, but everything I had was very good.. I would like to go back to try other things..."}
{"text":"The best French bistro in Calgary hands down. It's as close to dining in France as you can get in Calgary as you can get. The menu never changes in the traditional way."}
