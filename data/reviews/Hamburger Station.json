{"text":"I'm not from the area, so I'm not biased by nostalgia. These are cheap burgers, and they taste like it. Not much different from a Wendy's or McDonald's burger. Waaaay too many onions. On the positive, it was very affordable. I was full after 4 burgers and small fries."}
{"text":"Been going here since i was a kid get the family pack 12 sliders 3 large fries and 2 orders of onion rings if your like me get a six pack of cold beer enjoy"}
{"text":"For a burger joint, this is as good as it gets!  Can't believe this place doesn't have 5 stars.  Burgers are delicious, the fries go perfectly with malt vinegar, and the lemonade tastes fresh."}
{"text":"When you think of Akron cultural icons, what is the first thing which comes to mind?  Perhaps the rubber factories?  LeBron James?  The Goodyear Blimp?  Well as for me, I think of Hamburger Station.  Some of my earliest memories was going with my family down to the old Hamburger Station on Britain Road and loading up their \"Family Pack\" of a dozen burgers.  While many of the Hamburger Stations closed after the original owner's death in the early 90's, the legacy lives on in Cuyahoga Falls, Portage Lakes and Ellet where Hamburger Station thrives.   Granted, it's a bit cliche to say that the Burgers are to die for, tasty little bits of heaven they are, in this case it is not hyperbole! Their specialty is of course sliders, much like White Castle, but unlike the national chain these sliders are actually good.  Admittedly they can be heavy on the onions, but the friendly staff at Hamburger Station will always customize your order to ones needs.  Their fries, fresh cut everyday, are without a shadow of a doubt the best fries you will find in a fast food establishment.  Fries not your thing?  Try an order of onion rings, again fresh cut daily!  They also have fresh squeezed lemonade and great coney dogs.  Hamburger Station is every bit a part of what makes my home city tick.  Originally designed as a cheap eat for the rubber workers decades later it still delights it legions of loyal patrons.  I recommend to anyone who wants a taste of what a true burger should taste like!"}
{"text":"An Akron original, hands down the best burger in town. Jim Lowe's legacy lives on!"}
{"text":"The wait staff were very friendly. The restaurant has a fair amount of seating. You could take a good size group here. The burgers were good. The battered mushrooms were probably our favorite during our visit."}
{"text":"Luv these burgers! I get double cheese burgers (sliders) every time I'm here. One patty disappears in the bun they use. Cooked to order so they're always fresh. Same with the fries & onion rings which I both like. They put onion/pickle & mustard on the  burgers. Next time Go to Blossom early & get a box of double cheese burgers and fries. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"So the wife and I tried this place.   It was good.   The burgers are more onion sandwiches with a touch of meat than burger.  We got the 6 burger special which came with a mountain of fries.   It was a good value.   I would definitely go here again, just wouldn't go out of my way for it.  Good greasy fix when needed, you should try it at least once."}
{"text":"To be fair, maybe they had a bad day, but these burgers tasted horrible - no exaggeration.  The only thing I did taste were the onions, which were slimy and tasted like they had been chopped at least three days before serving them.  Maybe that's their recipe and you either have a taste for it or you don't.  I went here on the advice of some coworkers.  I might try again, but the first time gave me no reason to want to go back.  The grease was soaking through the bag, which I don't mind at Five Guys because the burgers don't taste three days old and the fries are spectacular.  I wasn't impressed by the price for what I got."}
{"text":"each month the company i work for has a day set aside for team building. we order some food and then do some sort of fun activity for the day. one month we ordered Hamburger Station because one co-worker believes it to be manna from heaven. a fan of White Castle, i tried the sliders from HS and couldn't believe how terrible the food was.  these are little tiny hamburgers and each had enough pickle and onion for 4 regular sized hamburgers. maybe the beef tasted good. i wouldn't know because i couldn't taste anything but the onion and pickle. one bite was enough. i threw the rest away. my opinion has not swayed my co-worker who stills believes this to be a great place to eat - and obviously others agree. i, however, am not likely to ever eat there again."}
{"text":"Great Food.  Yes, they definitely load up the burgers with onions, probably more onions than I've ever had on anything. but that's part of the flavor!  My wife, who really doesn't even much care for onions, loves Hamburger Station burgers.  They have the best fries in the fast food business, and their fried mushrooms are the best I've had anywhere. Thanks Hamburger Station for continuing the tradition of fabulous fast food!"}
{"text":"Grease is king at this long time Akron institution. Gone are the relics of a kid's dream restaurant- cowboy decor, saddles on the barstools and a miniature red car with a dashboard table. Luckily what did remain all the makeovers is the amazing food. Do me a favor and forget ketchup even exists as it has no place here - the founder would be so upset to see it on the tables. Order 2-3 hamburgers with everything- mustard, pickle and onion. Get the fresh cut fair fries and sprinkle them with malt vinegar. You are now ready to ingest greasy 50's joy. Some in the know will ask the cook to dip twice-- wink wink."}
{"text":"It is true-If you don't like real sliders, then don't go.  They are not \"gourmet\" burgers.  They use fresh cut tasty onions and pickles on a fresh bun.  Ask them to dip the bun twice on the grill for an extra greasy taste.  Their french fries are true fresh cut as well as homemade onion rings and lemonade.  We love this place."}
{"text":"We stumbled on this bastion of greasy goodness this past weekend and I must say, it might offer one of the best breakfasts in the area.  The portions were huge and the quality was superb.  Lots of creative choices like greek cheese and eggs which was a glorious helping of wheat bread with grilled, imported greek cheese, two eggs and a huge helping of wonderful hashbrowns.  The atmosphere is a total throw-back with service you'd expect from what appears to be a long-standing local institution.  Unfortunately they dont have any locations on the west side of Akron so I guess north and east will have to do for now.  Must go back and try their hamburgers."}
{"text":"If you're not health conscious, if you don't care about exercise or diet and especially nutrition, then you will LOVE Hamburger Station.  It's pretty much a menu of only burgers.  They're sized similar to White Castle's but that's where any comparison ends.  Hamburger Station's three-bite sized burgers are greasy, delicious and cooked to perfection.  I don't believe I've ever had such bad food that tastes so good.  This restaurant defines greasy spoon.  They have old fashioned counter seating, as well as booths and tables.  Our family was pleased with their service, quality and speed.  In addition to burgers they offer fresh cut fries, onion rings and lemonade sourced from real lemons.  I was shocked at 1pm on a Saturday to see many patrons eating breakfast.  With the burgers being so small they offer six packs and 12-packs.  The 12-pack is a family pack.  All their burgers come with onion, mustard and pickle. I asked for half normal and half special order plain....they came just as ordered and it was more than enough for our whole family, and for take away.  Only negative was their Pepsi products...burger and shake joints should offer Coke products--an American staple."}
{"text":"Not like it used to be...miss the western theme and saddles.  Fries were great. Hamburger underwhelming more onion than beef."}
{"text":"Good old fashion diner style eating. They cook it all right in front of you. You know what you're getting into: greasy, delicious food that will satisfy your appetite and your wallet.   Doesn't look like much from the outside but this place has a lot of character. Try Yasoo for breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town!  Food is cooked perfectly, large portions and daily specials are a fantastic value!  Staff is friendly and do a great job!"}
{"text":"Awesome, non-corporate business and a real bang for your buck! I'm definitely stopping by again.    I got a 6 pack of sliders and onion rings through the drive through. I assumed the sliders would be small, like what is served at most restaurants but they were actually pretty big. The onion rings were also large. They had a soft-crunch to them, which is my preference.   The burgers came in a box, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that they were much bigger than I had imagined, and only for about $8 with cheese on all of them.   The burger patties were thin, though not bad. I did not have time to look at the menu and see if they had larger burger patties. This is definitely something I'll be looking for next time I come back.   Service was really nice too!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here.  We came because people told us it was an Akron staple, like Swenson's.  The food was decent for the price, but nothing to write home about.  I will have to say the fries were delicious and the food came out very quick.  If you're drunk and it's late and you're with a group of friends this is a good option!  There are many other great burger options in the area!"}
{"text":"Good and greasy local spot. The sides almost beat out the burgers. Ask them to go light on the onion and make it a double cheeseburger!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Hamburger Station and I am so happy to see it is still around after Lowe's death.  I grew up getting an occasional burger and fries here from the late 70's until I moved away for good in '95.  I love the fresh cut fries and the Hamburger buns rubbed on the griddle before putting the 'burg in.  I can still remember sitting in the saddle stools as a kid.   Tasty, tasty, tasty"}
{"text":"We arrived at Hamburger Station (one of my favorite cheap burger joints) for a quick bite; and boy does this place always deliver. I must start off by saying, if you are loyal to any sort of diet that involves lowering caloric and/or fat intake, I must steer you away from this place. The burger's secret for decades has been to do with the grease they use to fry them. No one knows what it is, but the amount of grease left within these small burgers will afford the best chance at guessing what it may be.   The taste and style of these burgers I would say shares the most similarities with White Castle, however Hamburger Stations burgers offer freshly made grilled meat over White Castles frozen steamed meat. If one wants to try a vanilla burger (an unmodified Hamburg) be prepared for a heaping pile of uncooked onions atop his/her burger, as well as some pickles, and mustard for flavor. These burgers are small and more like a slider than  a normal burger albeit bigger than White Castle's.  What offsets their size is their value. Currently, (as of 5/21/2018) Hamburger Station has a deal that will get you 6 Hamburgs, and 2 large orders of fries all for 8.49. This is more than enough to feed 2 regular people for lunch in my opinion. One doesn't need a special to get deals however, as their hamburgers are only 1.14 a piece, and they offer many other things such as gyros, breakfast sandwiches and more for great low prices.   All in all, if your not on a diet, strong in the arteries, and looking for a cheap meal that'll satisfy your greasy burger cravings, look no farther than Hamburger Station. They have a great selection of great, cheap, and delicious food for a low price. Highly Recommended!"}
{"text":"They can't follow simply instructions ever.  I always ask for _no_toppings  so that I might actually be able to taste the meat, but its like they load em up ever more just to play games.  F these people.  Go to a different Hamburger Station to avoid juvenile games."}
{"text":"Although the food is good, the packaging they put their to go orders in is terrible.  Grease got all over my car due to the them putting French fries from the fryer directly into a paper bag by themselves.  Was awful.  They need an inner package like other fast food chains or drain the fries better"}
{"text":"When I was a kid I use to love this place but it has gone down hill and doesn't have that same taste to it anymore...I tried it one more time and the buns were soggy meat was dry no flavor at all. Fries were mushed up in the bag....what a disappointment"}
{"text":"The burgers, fries, onion rings, and gyros are all out of this world good. These aren't typical hamburgers but if you love onion you must give them a try. This place is just pure greasy goodness! Service is usually prompt and I've never had a problem with them getting a drive thru order wrong. Been eating Hamburger Station since I was about 5 and it's easily in my top 5."}
{"text":"Greasy and delish! Fries are amazing and the burgers are craveable. This place is an Akron area institution. If you've never tried it,  give it a shot!"}
