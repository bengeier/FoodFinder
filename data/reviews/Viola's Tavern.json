{"text":"Not sure what other reviewers experienced, but I thought Viola's was great. Staff was friendly fast and just attentive enough, and the place was packed last night for the Las Vegas premiere of the desert racing movie \"Dezert People 13\"."}
{"text":"Swing shift.  I have been there 5 times in the last month (it's down the street from my house).  The bartender (Trevor) barely says two words to people, and only acknowledges them by what they drink.  I went here with two friends who come here all the time, and we are in the \"industry\". The only time the bartender offers me anything (after looking up from his crossword or whatever), is when I ask.  He only knows my name because my friends told him, never asks how peoples days are, an frankly is one of the worst bartenders I have ever been around.  Around the corner, there are three bars with friendly bartenders who talk to you and understand what their job is.  Oh, and one more thing.  In five times of being here, and spending about 10 hours here, I've yet to see the guy pick up a towel and wipe ANYTHING down.  As we in the business know...If you don't see cleanliness in the FOH, you know the BOH is even worse.  And again, it's not like the guy doesn't know that I live around the corner, my roommate and his gf come here all the damned time.  IMO, it's just the worst laziness I have ever seen in a bartender.  EDIT: After writing this, I read the reviews...Wow why would ANYONE come to this POS.  EVERYONE has noted how bad the \"service\" is.  I guess they just don't give a shit."}
{"text":"Best hot wings in town and great machines. I read a review below about how the bartenders are not friendly which I never experienced. True they're not always talking to you but I prefer that over being pestered when I'm playing video poker.   Seriously, come here and try the wings...so awesome"}
{"text":"Came here couple of times but this time the service sucks balls played 60 bucks asked for change was shorted 10 bucks never coming here again"}
{"text":"They have a sign outside of their store that says \"pizza 24/7\" so I thought wow a pizza place nearby that will satisfy my midnight pizza cravings! So I call last night to ask if I can order pizza and they said the kitchen closes at 9 pm every day.. What the heck.  So 1 star for false advertisement ):"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar, great drinks, service. And the food is good too!  Great payouts, abd always a laid back good time."}
{"text":"We'll start with 4 stars for now. The bartender was exceptionally friendly, and poured a good drink. The place has 2 soft tip dart boards, and 2 pool tables. Lots of TVs and plenty of space at the bar. Poker machines have 10 cent poker and keno too!  It feels a little Divey, but I think the new ownership is going to spruce it up. Looking forward to having some food available at this neighborhood bar!"}
{"text":"Good food and great ambience. It feels to me that the keno here pays more often that any other bar around, maybe it's just me lol. If you are looking for a good place to unwind after work and have a tasty hamburger, this is the place."}
{"text":"If you want a place that lets you do your thing, listen to music, play, win some and get good refills. Then check it out. But don't, we like that it wasn't busy."}
{"text":"Viola's hosts Mob City Pizza, which is really Viola's short order food business. So Viola's has been advertising a beer/pizza special and i get e-mail notifications about that special very often. During Golden Knight hockey games customers are encouraged to buy 2 pitchers of beer and a pizza for $24.00.  But when i went into Viola's to take advantage of this special i was informed that the kitchen was out of pizza dough. I then asked the bartender if he was willing to substitute another food item in place of the pizza. I specifically asked to substitute the $12.00 pizza for a $8.00 order of chicken fries. The bartender wouldn't do it!"}
{"text":"Viola's [formerly Jack Potter's] has lived across the street from me for the 7 years Ive been in my condo. Yet we've never been there until today.   It is a very spacious bar area. The actual bar is huge and curves around with many gaming table tops. In the bar area there are several seating areas, a big juke box & great lighting.   We ordered 2 bloody mary's - Surprise! And 2 appetizers. The bloody marys were good, just the right amount of spice. No special vodkas or garnishes. Tasty. We got the pot stickers - Delicious! And the pretzel bites with some kind of cheese whiz. Meh. Next time & there will be!   Upon entering, they have a nice area - see pics - with couches, chairs & tables. Perfect for a small party / girls night out / gaming aka RPG.   Staff was attentive & gracious. It was quite crowded at 3pm on a Monday. Ok it is a Hollyday.   Great fat girl seating!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. If every meal is as I ate it.... dude murders it. Tenders... bomb.... Pizza... bomb.... sandwich is out to jury but promising"}
{"text":"Great place to come watch a game or grab a bite to eat, the bar is divided in 2 sections, one has a TV and tables which I think is great for having a pizza with friends and family during football season and the the other side has the bar, however you can still order food anywhere, although there isn't a server in this place, Trevor (the bartender) did a great job taking care of us. I will definitely be coming back for more."}
