{"text":"Delightful atmosphere, lots of natural light and cute bistro-style tables. Food is fresh and portions are generous. Garlic bread is nuanced and filling - tremendously yummy (and I'm not a garlic bread fan normally). Great cocktails too. Reasonably priced for atmosphere and food. Spend some time on the island and have a wonderful dinner at Mimi's!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment, and I am generally accused of being an easy marker.  First and foremost, the noise at Mimi's was unbearable. The acoustics are so bad it sounds like you're in a cafeteria at high noon.  Management didn't seem to notice and thought adding music (at least thats what we thought it was) might add to the ambiance -- wrong -- it made normal conversation impossible.  That, you should fix.  Service was relentlessly average but everyone seemed overworked so perhaps there is not enough staff. While it took more than 30 minutes to order our food (at lunch that is unacceptable) the people at the neighbouring table waited one hour for the food. They asked for boxes so they could at least have a take out lunch and that took another 20 minutes. Again, that must be fixed.  Unfortunately, the wait was not only not worth it, it was a little dangerous.  My dining companion has a gluten allergy and, good for Mimi's, they offered a gluten free risotto (I guess that shouldn't be too hard with a classic Italian rice dish).  Unfortunately, they served it with a slab of bread on top of the risotto! My guest assumed it was gluten free but thought she should ask, good she did, it was not. No apology, no nothing for a mistake that is unforgiveable in this day and age.  In any event the risotto was not risotto, but some sort of a cross between a paella and a fried rice dish. There was no creaminess no classic Italian richness, just a dry rice dish. Where is Gordon Ramsey when you need him, this would have been deposited in the \"bin\" and the Chef made to start over. Do it right or take it off the menu.  My other companion had a caeser salad that looked like lettuce soup the dressing on it was so thick.  My salad contained inedible asparagus stalks -- stringy and tough, and although the menu advertised \"roasted tomatoes\" on the salad there were two pieces, each about the size of a quarter in the entire salad. The water was good."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic lunch here with a couple friends the other day.

I ordered a Poached Pear & Walnut Salad that was really quite good. There was more dressing mixed in with the salad than I usually prefer, but as it turns out, the dressing was really very tasty, I couldn't get enough. For $12 the salad was enough for lunch (although if you have a big appetite, grab an appetizer too).

The menu is varied enough, with many healthy choices and many great looking pastas, pizzas, and sandwiches. And desserts. And actually, although we didn't pay much attention to it at lunch, the wine menu was quite long. The service was great (some of the staff seemed new, but they made no mistakes--they compensated by providing better than expected service). We were in and out quite quickly.

There are many tables, for large and small parties. And I love the giant windows: floor to ceiling--and the ceiling is very hight. This makes Mimi's feel very spacious, although as a previous reviewer mentioned it might contribute to unfortunate acoustics when the place is busy (for lunch it was no problem).

My only complaint was the ridiculously long list of \"specials\". It took a whole minute (or more?) for our server to read the list of specials, which I promptly ignored. Everything else about Mimi's was great. Actually, I'm craving that Poached Pear & Walnut Salad right now, two days later."}
