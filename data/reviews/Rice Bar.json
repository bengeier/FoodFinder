{"text":"I think this place is great.  Don't judge it until you've tried it.  The restaurant is fairly romantic, dimmed, dark, and very laid back.  I had a great time eating there while reading my Jack Kerouac novel.  The food may not be the best, but I like the selections.  Its also a very good place for vegans.  First you get to pick the type of grain, brown rice? noodle? soba?  Second you pick the sauce, miso? plum? soy? garlic? Third you pick the entree, tofu? chicken? ...etc.  Then they cook up the bowl for you.  You can also pick a smaller size if you aren't so hungry.  I find the portion not so big, but very european oriented size.  So if you want something big and large, go down to the street to some random chinese restaurant on Spadina.  Or else enjoy a good sake with your rice bowl here at Rice Bar."}
{"text":"Rice Bar is a really unique restaurant in a really unique area (Kensington Market). It has a very cool food system. The way it works is, you order a type of rice or noodle, then a protein (i.e. meat) then some unique vegetables, and then a sauce, and the chefs create it for your and bring it to you.   I've been here a couple times hoping that my combination's would create for a killer meal but the food somehow always tastes a bit bland and watered down. However I really like the cozy atmosphere and I REALLY like their wide variety of freshly brewed iced-tea's! I've never really had anything like them before so make sure you ask them for what kinds they have available.  The service is nice, the place is chique and clean but again the food isn't exceptional. OH and they also have vegan and vegetarian food for all those people of those types :)  Usual price for the food is around $7-11 depending on the size of bowl you get."}
{"text":"Overpriced for what you get. My tofu was burnt, and you basically get mostly rice. But I couldn't taste the \"salsa\" that came with the food.  Service was ok I guess but I had to go up a couple of time because I didn't want to wait forever.   I think Rice Bar may appeal more to health-yuppies than people interested in food. The menu looked so promising, but the results weren't there. I doubt I'd go back."}
{"text":"I don't quite understand this new trend in understaffed restaurants.  Is it worth sacrificing the experience of your patrons to save a couple dollars?  I ordered the World Toast for brunch one Saturday.  The menu described it as \"Egg bread infused with star anise served with pineapple salsa, strawberry coulis and a white chocolate espuma\".  Sounded great.  But for $9, all I got were 3 slices of cold french toast, pressed too thin by a spatula.  The presentation was nice, but for the price, I expected a larger portion, or at least, my food served hot.  I must mention, however, that The Eggs Lala presentation was nothing short of spectacular.  It took our waitress about 10 minutes to take our drink order when we first sat down.  It took another 30 minutes for our food to arrive, and in that time, we still had not received our drinks.  When we asked about it, a male server said it was his fault and he had messed up the drink order.  We asked for water in the meantime so we could begin eating our meals that had arrived.  We overheard them say that they were understaffed, but with 2 people in the kitchen, 2 people serving, and a half-full place, it should not have been that hard to keep things running smoothly.  In the time after we had been seated, we saw one couple beside us get up and leave because no one came to take their order.    At the end of our meal, we had to get up ourselves to ask for the check (after waiting a long time), and then again to pay for it at the cash counter.  We saw 2 other couples sitting near us do the same because no one could get a hold of a server.    I like the concept but it's just not working.  The menu was promising, but the food didn't follow through, and the service was nearly the worst I've ever experienced."}
