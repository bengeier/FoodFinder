{"text":"A little hard to find this place in the back of center but worth it. Clean and good food. We had Mongolian beef, chow mein, egg rolls and pot stickers. Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"We love the honey walnut shrimp.  Enough food to share for two seniors. Great meal. Great service. Small and casual"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim... BEST Chinese food I've ever eaten!! I got chicken hibachi and it was amazing. Reasonably priced, about $10-$15 per meal for dinner (huge portions too!). Our waitress was attentive and filled our drinks as soon as they were half empty. Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Best authentic Chinese food in Charlotte. Ask for their \"secret\" menu for your Chinese stomach!"}
{"text":"Awesome dinner so glad they are open. They have the same delicious food as before just different restaurant name. Broccoli lover with chicken is amazing."}
{"text":"Yikes.. did this place change ownership?  Have enjoyed past meals (lunch, dinner) -- good quality and fresh food --  maybe just a bad night, but Miso soup was  \"instant\"  fo' sure.. cold and clumps of broth mix stuck to spoon and bottom.. Crispy things with wife's soup were stale.. seem \"recycled\" --- meals were tasteless, old and odd.   Appeared children  playing or sleeping in bathroom -- Wonder what they do in the kitchen?  Ugh..  Just some tips -- clean, fresh, consistent and well made will get people back.  I am kinda scared to go back. Trick or Treat?  -- Happy Halloween."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of Cornelius, Huangs China Bistro is the best takeout or dine-in Chinese food in town. The food is beyond delicious and the atmosphere of the restaurant is truly authentic. A great choice for a quick bite to eat or a classic chinese dining experience."}
{"text":"In my humble opinion, BEST CHINESE in Lake Norman! I have never eaten in the restaurant so can only speak to my experience after placing several orders for pick up.
We often hang out at the draft house next door and find ourselves needing food to supplement our beer consumption. I was excited when I heard that a Chinese restaurant was going in next store but, having had my share of bad Chinese food, I was also hesitant. After trying it the first time, I am now ecstatic to have such wonderful Chinese food in the Lake Norman area. And y'all can rest assured that the great food was not a fluke. I have now ordered from here more times than I care to admit. Without fail, the food is always ready in 15 minutes.
My favorites: the Scallion Chicken, the Crab Rangoon, and the Salt and Pepper Calamari."}
{"text":"Abysmal.  Ordered take out,  it was a 25 min wait.  Ok it's a Friday night we sat on the little bench and watched the owners kiddos go crazy.  We support small businesses.  While waiting we noticed the very low health rating posted in the wall and I regretted paying for the food ahead of time.  But....
Upon receiving the order and getting home less than 5 min later, we unpacked and looked forward to relaxing dinner in with some yummy Asian.  No.  I threw my entire order out after trying 6 or 7 bites, I kept thinking it could get better.  Absolutely no flavor, over cooked not at all what I had expected.  My daughter ate her egg roll and liked it but wouldn't finish her dumplings which she normally likes to order. 
Waste of over $20 a nice Friday night dinner and not in the mood to go back out to get different food.  
My recommedation is avoid this place!"}
{"text":"Incredible food. Best Chinese food in the area. Went there one evening just because we were trying out eateries in the area since we had just moved here. We were seated right away at a comfortable booth. We ordered a shrimp dish to share. The shrimp were hugh and in a delicious sweet sauce. It was incredibly good. We have since been back and tried other dishes, all delicious. We highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I recently ordered delivery from here and was pleasantly surprised. My food was hot, delicious, correct and was delivered to my home very quickly. Thank You!"}
{"text":"I am conflicted with this review. The service was great, the waitress was very nice. The food was very good and the prices reasonable. But unfortunately, I probably won't be back... I like a glass of wine with dinner, and I was incredibly disappointed to find this nice restaurant was alcohol free. If this ever changes, I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"More like fast food Chinese from an airport. Hardly any meat. Overly filled with onion or green pepper. 

There are two kinds of good Chinese: good tasting Americanized Chinese and authentic gourmet.  This is neither of those."}
{"text":"Great authentic Chinese cuisine.  Highly recommend for those that like traditional Chinese food. They also have American style Chinese food on their menu."}
{"text":"Great food in a cozy atmosphere. Szechuan chicken was great and the spicy mustard sent it over the top. We were in a rush, and the food arrived at the table quickly without asking for a rush order. Family owned and these are nice people. Plenty of parking too. If you try this place, you'll become a regular."}
{"text":"5 stars is well deserved. It's hard to find a good Chinese take out that has real flavor, and this place has it. From their orange chicken, fried rice , orange peel chicken ,  low mein or pork pot stickers.. everything was great! And seemed like good quality /fresh."}
{"text":"Vey disappointed.  The chicken was not even edible and had a very odd taste. Vegetables were mushy.  Shrimp dish was not good  fishy tasting. Will never eat there again. 30 dollars down the drain. All went in trash."}
{"text":"After traveling from upstate NY, we decided to YELP a Chinese restaurant. What a hidden little treasure! Once we finally made it through the maze of a plaza. Fresh, modern decor, nice, heavy silverware, deep cushioned chairs and fun, trendy plates. Started with dumplings... Wonderful! Then had Garden Chicken.... Amazing!
WISH I LIVED CLOSER."}
{"text":"Wife was at the beach and I had wanted to try this place and I'm glad I did.

My wife and several of her friends from the neighborhood went to Myrtle Beach  so I was left to fend for myself. No big deal but I get a chance to try some places I've been meaning to try but never got around to and this was one of them.

Easy to overlook and relatively new, it's right up from a couple of restaurants we normally frequent. Needless to say, under these circumstances, easy to overlook.

Walked in an basically deserted. Initial though was , not a good sign. A bit later, a young lady came out with a order for delivery. As such she promptly seated me, gave me a menu and took my order for hot Green Tea.

Interesting menu and one of my elusive favorites was there, Mongolian Style Beef.  Found on a lot of menu's and most have the little Chili Pepper indicating spicy and with heat, but most are devoid of any of the characteristic of Mongolian Cuisine.

With reluctantly and with a hope for something better than what I found locally, I ordered  the Mongolian Style Beef with Rice.

While I waited, I studies the scene.  Very few patrons but a robust take out and delivery service. I'll probably take advantage of the delivery service next time I order so that enplanes to low number of patrons at tables

My meal arrived and it was everything I had hoped for. The proper amount of heat and spiciness and at the same time, plenty of beef and a proper balance of meat vs Veggies.

The Rice was perfect and as for the Tea, I had ordered Tea the night before and it had had a burnt taste as opposed to the light fresh taste of green tea.  This was perfect.

All in all,  a great meal and I will be definitely be back"}
{"text":"My wife discovered Huang's a month ago and last night we were there again.  And this morning I'm still thinking of the phenomenal dinner we had.  Seriously, IT'S THAT GOOD!!!!

Disclaimer, if you're into that greasy slimy airport fast food Chinese crap, you're not going to enjoy this place.  Of course, they've got some of that Chinese-American stuff, but we go there for the authentic Chinese food.

We had the steamed fish, black peppered prawns, tofu beef soup, peppercorn beef stew, pork with chayote, fried udon, tofu shrimp, green pepper/onion beef, kung pao chicken, and fresh saut√©ed clams.  Yeah, there were 6 of us but we ate like an army of 12 -- \"strong\" eaters!

Now, if you show up and order this, you'll wait a long while to get your food.  It's because this place is not Panda Express!  My awesome wife called in the hours beforehand.  This is a small family owned business that cooked our meal to order.

Instead of continuing my rambling of how this place reminds me of Mom's cooking (yes I'm Asian) or my last vacation in Shanghai, I'll give you my recommendations:
If you're into spicy food:  call ahead and order the peppercorn beef soup.  It is super flavorful and will remind you of beef hotpot.
Seafood: call ahead for the steamed fish.  They also have a fried fish with sweet sauce.  Both are amazing!
Tofu:  beef tofu soup.  I can fill myself up on that alone.
Slimy gross Chinese food: somewhere else.  Joking aside, they made our meal to order, so if you called ahead and asked for it, who knows.

Just remember to call ahead if you plan on ordering anything that's not on the menu!"}
{"text":"Went there a few times. Food and service is great every time. Love their spicy dishes. They also make pretty good mild and tasty food. Will go back!"}
{"text":"clean place . It is not authentic Chinese food but good American Chinese food . 
The shrimp Li mien is delicious !"}
{"text":"The best Chinese take out in the Cornelius/Huntersville area!  I tried it due to its Yelp reviews and was not disappointed.  Generous portions and delicious entrees, really recommend the Salt and Pepper Squid!  Bonus, you can step next door and grab a craft beer while you are waiting!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, this is the best Chinese food we have had in the area.  It opened recently and our family has already dined in twice and taken out once.  Every time the dumplings and honey sesame chicken is divine, although dining in is always better.  Service is excellent and run by a lovely family.  There is limited seating and staff, so when a carry out order is called in, they do take the call, but honestly it's not an issue as it is not a 5 star restaurant, it is what it is...a great family oriented Chinese restaurant with excellent food, friendly service and reasonable prices.  We really enjoy this place and hope others will as well."}
{"text":"Ordered take out for the first time and was pleasantly surprised.  The dinner combos come with an egg or spring roll, I got the General's chicken and my wife got the Garlic Chicken, we both really liked our meals.  The take out comes in a container with a compartment just for the rice, which was nice.  

My kids liked the pork fried rice.  I think they use some type of honey or sweet pork, it was very tasty.  And the Shrimp Lo mien was well liked too.  

The menu had more options than we expected, you can get just the dinner meal or make it a combo.  And it was very reasonably priced.  The total was just over $40 for 5 people.  

We will definitely be back and try some other options."}
{"text":"I have ordered from them a few times, and sure it's not the best Chinese food but it is good. They are always on time, food is good, and who doesn't love Chinese delivery?!"}
{"text":"Good lunch prices for the area.  Nothing is spicy however.  Even the chili paste itself is bland. 
Better places around."}
{"text":"Excellent food but could use some business advice direction.  Every dish is carefully presented using excellent ingredients.  Servings are generous.  Some advice: you don't take orders on the phone when you have tables waiting to be served, have drinks refilled, etc.  You put callers 'on hold.'  Also, you don't seat the only group in the restaurant next to your dish station because it's fewer steps for you to serve them, when any other table with a more desirable view is available.  I'm thinking this is why takeout is such a big part of their business vs dining in.
Their product is very good but they need to think the service aspect through much more thoroughly."}
{"text":"So happy to have found a family run Chinese restaurant! The food was freshly made and delicious. We ordered the house fried rice and Hunan style chicken. The fried rice had a very fragrant pineapple taste. They do a great job marinading the white meat chicken so that it taste smooth and tender as dark meat. The sauce for the Hunan chicken had a mild spice to it and very flavorful. There were a lot of veggie too. Definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Terrible food. The worst chinese food i've ever eat. 
Quality is bad. Don't waste your time.

Respond to the owners comment below:

No it wasn't about the sides or amount of food. In fact it was a lot of food. The problem was the flavor and quality. Chicken was like rubber and unable to eat with a weird flavor and the rice was sticky. It didn't look or taste fresh."}
{"text":"We happened upon it opening night and now came back for a second. Husband and wife own it with great pride. Excellent ingredients, personal service and beautiful served! I encourage you to go often and eat there!!! Best Chinese in the area."}
{"text":"THEY DELIVER!!!!!! I could eat here every day! This is authentic Chinese food and I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. I highly recommend the hot and sour soup and the hibachi shrimp and chicken. Some of the best I have ever tried. I am sick today and called Huang  to place a to go order of this soup and he had it ready and waiting for me when I walked in the door. Now that's service!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously great food.  The food is so fresh, vegetables were crispy and fresh (the way they are supposed to be), and it seemed to be very low in sodium - something I don't find often with Chinese food.  We just loved it.  Looking forward to ordering take-out more often!"}
{"text":"Bring family Try food again tonight.  Always good Food 

always great and fresh. The best place for Asian around.  I love the Honey Walnut Shrimp. Shrimp &Scallop with Ginger sauce.  Hibachi was awesome as well!!!! 
Perfect dinner. Perfect night !"}
