{"text":"The best chicken shawarma plater I've ever had! So fresh! And the owners are so pleasant and nice! They literally put a smile on my face! Delicious! And overly generous on the portions! My togo container barely closed. Haha, I'll be back for sure! I can't believe more people aren't raving about this place!   It is a small place with only a few tables and in an older plaza. Just a heads up :) Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Just because the neighbouring landlord has made it hard to get here and just because these might be the friendliest folks in the area, we will be back again and again.  The food is fresh, the flavours are subtle and the portions are large.  Screw you nasty neighbour, we are coming back !!!"}
{"text":"Speed read. 1) Home made ingredient and sauce swarma 2) Good portion size , good proportion of meat and veggie. 3) Falafel is well made.  Taste better than the chicken.  I work in Bolton, and stop by various places for lunch. Bolton is a small town, and I would try to rate it relative to other places locally.  For some reason, there's a lot of swarma place in Bolton.   The store is a smaller store and less commercialized.  It's operated by the owner.  The best part is that everything is home made, and the owner is eager to discuss everything about their food.  For me, I like to taste the food as well as learn about the food that I am eating.  The proportion of meat and veggie is just right.  Everyone wants more and more, but too much veggie and cold stuff will cool down the whole swarma, dilute the meat taste, and may even start to drip, making a big mess.  I usually order meat swarma, either beef or chicken.  However, when the owner ask me to try the falafel, it was a pleasant surprise that it taste better than the meat.     The access to the parking lot and store is not very good.  You can park on the south side of the plaza and walk thru the corridor to get to the store.  The dollarama/Harvey mall has no access to it.    The plaza owner decided to put a fence up to separate the plazas, which is bad for business."}
{"text":"Fantastic shawarma. Made fresh homemade by the lovely owners. Not speedy by any means, but made with love. I usually get the shawrma dinner or the shawrma with salad. Have also had their family platters on a few occasions (best to call ahead for those). You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious falafel.   Husband had the chicken shawarma which he said was outstanding.  Very fresh.  Friendly owners."}
