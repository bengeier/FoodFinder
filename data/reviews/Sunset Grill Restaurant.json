{"text":"Probably comes as a surprise: but I had one of the best burgers in Toronto at this location. Will definitely be back and will get the burg again."}
{"text":"3 eggs,really looks like 1.5. Pancakes were ok. Basically, nothing special about this place."}
{"text":"Consistent....in terms of terrible staff, and absolutely mediocre food. Go to bus terminal next door, maha's on greenwood or motorama at jones."}
{"text":"The prices aren't bad for what you get.

I got a breakfast special with 3 (small) eggs, 3 pieces of slightly too salty pemeal bacon, toast and home fries for less than 8 bucks. 

But there were only 4 tables occupied and a few take away orders between two waitresses and I was never brought the coffee I ordered (although I had to ask to have it taken off my bill at the end) nor did my server ask me how my meal was or if I needed anything. 

So all in all, 3 out of 5 for well portioned and tasty enough food, but lack of service."}
{"text":"After sitting for 10 minutes, the waitress finally hurried past us to attend to another table who had been seated well after us and promised that she'd be right back to take our order. So we waited, and waited and waited some more, but eventually gave up, and walked out. I understand that they were busy, but come on."}
{"text":"Okay breakfast joint, service is not optimal.  Food shows up super-fast, which is great.  Definitely not as good as the other instances of the chain."}
{"text":"I promised myself I wasn't coming back here but after 6 months or so, I wanted to believe Sunset had improved. This Sunset repeatedly fails my expectations for this chain. The bacon is always soggy. They break the yolk when cooking over hard eggs. The toast is always soaked in butter so I ordered butter on the side and never go any. Coffee refills are slow. The one thing that has changed is that they give less potatoes now. Very disappointed and prices went up!"}
{"text":"Have been to this location a number of times.  This week it was intolerable!  The banging of dishes and clanging of plates was horrendous.  It's a wonder they have one plate left. Mentioned the noise level to both waitresses, and they said it's that we sat near the prep area. Ridiculous not to be able to have a conversation or hear yourself think. Migraine not necessary when you go out for breakfast."}
{"text":"It was a good greasy breakfast experience here. The place was packed, with a line, yet service was super fast - I had my food within ten min of sitting down.  The food wasn't fancy but it did.what it was supposed to do. Service was nice and the coffee decent.  Price was good. For a no-frills breakfast, I would return here."}
{"text":"the one star is for the kind waitress..

well they may have semi reno, but the food is gross.  i ate half an egg and one piece of toast.  egg tasted funny rubbery, bacon was so salty it was inedible, potatoes tasted sour left them alone, toasty was not toasted, gross gross gross, all this for 10 bucks hurray...and people wonder why i go for dim sum for breakie....by the way i had diarrhea when i got home...that may have been from the over consumption of cabbage soup yesterday...on a good note it all has turn me off eating for the rest of the day..,....THX for listening to my morning rant."}
{"text":"Averaged out to just \"OK\".  My Florentine Omelet (spinach and swiss) was good, but my tablemates, each of whom had the Texas Omelet (onions, green peppers and corn beef hash) were not impressed.

The home fries were good, toast was tasty, coffee was typical diner fare.

Don't make a special trip.  If you're already here, go to the Bus Terminal Diner next door.  Better vibe and food."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, fast service. Big portions for a reasonable price. Nothing exciting or different, just a yummy classic breakfast. Could use a better coffee selection."}
{"text":"My first time at this Sunset Grill location this morning was better than expected. Fast service and above average, standard breakfast fare. We both had the Canadian omelet and sausage, and our coffees were refilled every ten mins - a must for any brunch place I go to. And our baby was happy in his own high chair. The bus boy promptly brought him a new spoon when he dropped his, which made us just as happy as we were low on toys. Friendly service and inexpensive dependable breakfast items will have me returning.

...But it is a bummer that there's not a really good, standout brunch place in my hood. Oh well."}
{"text":"Food was great, portions were large. It was busy, expected on a Saturday morning but the waitress checked in often and refilled our coffee. The downside was that it was about 30 mins for our food and the table who arrived after us was served first. Otherwise, great food, great service and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here dozens of times, usually on Sundays, and have never had a bad meal. The food comes to us piping hot and the proportions are more than generous. Never has there been an issue over substitutions, either, and the table service - in fact the entire staff - offer friendly, prompt and personable service. We used to frequent the Terminal until they changed hands (and d√©cor...the fluorescent green seats are blinding) and couldn't be happier. No matter how busy they are, which seems to be always, servers come to the table smiling and are never empty-handed."}
{"text":"Very busy and the wait for breakfast was good half hour but...it was delicious.  Love Saturday morning breakfast specials.  Thick rye toast and great coffee!"}
{"text":"It's so sad that we have so few awesome breakfast places on the east end. This place is okay. Nothing great. Mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Went there this morning January 2, 2016 at 8:45am. There were 4 tables filled with either a single or two patrons. The two servers on didn't acknowledge us, we just sat there, they weren't busy just walking around still no acknowledgement so we got up and left. I've been there before and the food is good however the service is horrible. If you hate your job so much and no longer care about customer service, quit. We are now sitting at a restaurant nearby where we were acknowledged with a hello and are about to eat. Sunset Grill, get your act together or get out of the business."}
{"text":"It's a greasy spoon.  You have to know that before walking through the door.  However, if you are hungry, hungover or in my case, just ran a half marathon then fast and friendly service, really low prices and good food is a 4-star rating in my opinion.  

I hadn't been there in 2 years, went last weekend, and the waitstaff remembered me.  I think that's grounds for a good review!"}
{"text":"The first time eating at this particular Sunset grill I discovered a long black hair on the side of my eggs ( I am a redhead)....a few months later I was back in the neighborhood and decided to try again. BIG mistake!!!

This time the potatoes were not fresh and both potatoes and my eggs were cold as well my boyfriend's eggs were not what he ordered.The same older waitress ( with long black hair) argued quite addimitly that I was wrong...the potatoes were fresh she said. 

We then waited for a new order and when those arrived our toast was cold, just like her friendly service."}
{"text":"I went to this sunset grille before moving to the area and I thought after moving near by I would be a regular here. It didn't happen I started to realize that quality is better than quantity and I found that they actually give you too much food and for a greasy spoon its a little too greasy. I heard it changed owners so maybe before when I actually liked the place it was the old owners. 

Now just much rather make a good breakfast at home and enjoy it in my own backyard"}
{"text":"i was sitting in sunset and wondering why this place has a handful of locations across the city.  after all, its just a diner.  their breakfasts, which have drawn me from a sunday slumber, are what attract me the most, yet theres nothing too special about them.  today i had your classic eggs, bacon, oj, toast and hashbrowns. 

the difference, though, was there were 3 eggs, about 6 pieces of great bacon (damn hard to screw that up though), freshly squeezed oj, the option of dark rye toast (unusual in a diner situation, and they were thick pieces) and for the descriptive finally, hash browns covered in melted cheddar cheese and oregano.  so then, it might appear that the step up is portion size for one. for two, you might say thinking outside of the box with the dressed up browns, and the rye toast.  as for the third round, the hash brown delight, it wasnt even offered as part of my breakfast special, but i asked if it was possible and because it wasnt a busy day the waitress added it on no problem.

now i dont know if it was extra, but i didnt care as i had all that and my wife had pancakes and it was 14 bucks.  pretty cheap i think.  

another reason for their popularity must be the down to earth professional staff, their other wide range of salads, soups, sandwiches, etc.  and the happy go lucky family environment that makes it perfect for aneighbourhood hangout, especially as a brunch venue."}
{"text":"We ended up here after finding out that the Bus Terminal (next door) was closed for renovations.

This place serves your regular breakfast/brunch/lunch fare. Prices are standard for this type of place.

Potatoes were probably the best part of the meal. Fresh, cooked/salted perfectly. The eggs were chewy and if I had to wager a guess I'd say some of the shell had gotten in the pan, but I have no proof of that.

Place was clean. Service was prompt and friendly. However, it's not a place I'd go out of my way to come back again."}
{"text":"This is your Canadian version of Coney Island if you are from Michigan. This place is really cheap when you think about the conversion. This is my second time going to this place and it's as good as the first. Come hungry because they really do feed you. This is all sit yourself."}
{"text":"Sat down for breakfast and ordered with the waitress only to find out 20 mins later that the vents were not working and we could not be served!"}
{"text":"Food was good. The weekday morning special is a good deal and the portions were larger than expected. If only they also had milkshakes!"}
{"text":"I can not believe I had no idea there was a Sunset Grill so close to the Beaches but on the Danforth. There is a paid parking lot close by which makes for my easier visiting by car.

The locations look very similar and that grand slam breakfast was fantastic. Despite my friend's horror and me ordering bacon so crispy it is close to burned, they did so anyway and it was perfection. My eggs were over well, the sausage was great and because it was pancake Tuesday they were only $1 each and money with to the Canada Cancer Society.

Our server was fantastic too, super friendly and helpful. I am so happy to have discovered this location (which she said was one of the original Sunset Grills) without having to go all the way to the Beaches.

Great decaf coffee, fantastic breakfast platter and excellent service. I will be back!

{"text":"I had lunch today at the Sunset Grill.

I felt like having breakfast for lunch so ordered 3 eggs (over easy) with ham, white toast and a glass of milk ... and it was good.

The servers weren't overly warm and fuzzy but they were efficient."}
{"text":"This place is located right across the street from McCrapaloos (aka McDonakds) and has a much better selection than its competitor, and it's quick. My wife and I had twice the amount the food you would get at another fast food restaurant, and for a portion of the price too. This place is not a dive, it's clean, with good breakfast food, and friendly and fast service. A good brekky joint where you can grab brekky quick, or sit and enjoy yourself on a lazy weekend Saturday/Sunday. Don't expect \"high end\", it is a simple but nice breakfast/lunch diner after all."}
{"text":"Great prices for the amount of food that you get. Very friendly service. I had the corned beef hash and a waffle, both of which were delicious. everyone in our group was satisfied with what they ordered. I would recommend this spot"}
{"text":"Came with some friends who come to this location regularly. Because of that, the service was great. Our waitress was all over the refills, getting our orders taken, and making sure we had everything we needed.

I just had a fruit salad which was ok. Some of the melon wasn't ripe. 

A good experience as usual for Sunset Grill. No frills, diner style, cheap and good."}
{"text":"I thought it would a regular thing when going to a Sunset Grill. Wrong !!!

The ownership did change but not the food. You would think it would be the same or improve, but nope it got worse. Sorry 

Maybe next time. Try other Sunset Grills for better food."}
