{"text":"Very unprofessional.. Can't understand / speak English. My conversation with these people was a disaster, just asked if they deliver & it took the lady 10 minutes to reply.. Asking me if I have a baby? ..then the husband comes on the phone and says he has no car. Um.. Definitely not even going to attempt to order from here in the future."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. Most recently I walked in to a cute old couple making spring rolls and listening to a Vietnamese radio show. That basically tells you every thing you need to know about the place. 

Solid pho, good sized portions and good prices. My favourite thing on the menu is the grilled chicken and beef on rice. Simple but super flavourful and very comforting. Make sure to get a fried egg on top. They fry it perfectly to the point where the whites are crispy and they yolk is just a bit soft. 

The owners don't speak English perfectly and you should definitely eat in instead of take out but this is the type of restaurant that every neighbourhood needs."}
{"text":"Pho Asia is a family owned, delicious spot that's the definition of supporting a local business. While the decor and ambiance is certainly not the greatest the food is unreal and the service is quick. Awesome, family owned Pho in Woodbridge."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy going here with the family until today when I found several insects in my take out, disgusting.
Do not eat here"}
