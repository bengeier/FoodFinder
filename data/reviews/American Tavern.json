{"text":"I come here 4 days a week. The food is really good given the price. They use quality ingredients which is unusual for a neighborhood bar where everyone knows everything. Beer prices are great especially during Indians games. The owners are probably high because they get %20 more for a shot of Patron than for a shot of McCallen 12. They clearly don't buy the bottles. Love this spot other than the new bartender. 

Been coming 3-4 days a week for years and left for the first time ever after waiting 16 minutes on a Wednesday without getting said \"hello\" to at the bar rail (they only have 15 people in the bar mind you)."}
{"text":"food is overpriced for an \"old school\" blue collar tavern. Fry's are $6 a basket and i had a $8 \"chicken\" sandwich with a chicken breast sliced so thin it had to have been 2oz.  Staff is friendly but didn't really care about my sandwich complaint."}
{"text":"The American Tavern is the perfect neighborhood bar/restaurant. Food is great, portions are very generous and very reasonably priced. They are expanding the craft beer selection and certainly pour a good drink. It truly is a great place to go and hang out with friends..lots of really nice people that go there and the staff is wonderful.If you want value for money spent and a good time out..this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Cheap good burgers and beer.  It's a bar. It has awesome bar food.yum yum yes yes eat here!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was once the Blue Star Tavern, WHICH HAD GREAT FOOD! Last night, for my 60th birthday I suggested to my friends that we hit the American Tavern, as in the past their clambakes, offered in October, were fabulous! This is definitely not the same restaurant.They too offered the clambake. We arrived relatively early, 5:30,sat at the bar and had a cocktail. We then asked to be seated. There was a large table in back open,but we were told it was reserved. I had called earlier in the week to inquire if they took reservations and was told only for parties of 8 or larger, but that I shouldn't worry, that I should stilll be able to be accommodated at 6:00. We were packed into a 4 top with a chair added at the end. The larger table earlier requested, ended up being dismantled and not used...Wait. it gets better...After about 10 min. the server came over in a frantic mode, and asked to take our order. We were prepared but felt he was really put out when we wanted to place a drink order. One couple ordered sandwiches, and we three ordered the advertised clambake. We did not receive our drinks for about 15 minutes. We sat and waited for 40 minutes for the food to be brought out. By this time , about 4 tables had got up and walked out. When the food starting with the barely warm clam chowder came out, we still did not have silverware on our table! The sandwiches were brought out, and they did look nice. We were then brought out plates with corn on the cobb, sweet potato, (undercooked),my charred black chicken,(which I had to scrape to eat,but the burnt flavor went through the meat, and two tough steaks that both had been prepared wrong.(one was over cooked, the other too rare.) Then apparently as dessert, the clams were brought out.The clams were the best part of the meal, and fairly, the couple with the sandwiches said that they were good. In total we waited 1.5 hrs for our meal. No apology from the manager, not even so much as comping us a round of drinks. Terrible service, and terrible food."}
{"text":"I come her frequently and generally satisfied with food. Tonight I ordered special , chicken pot pie for $9.  What a waste of money. Was so small, appetizer size. I then ordered a side salad since I felt like I hadn't even eaten. I mentioned this to the \"manager\" on duty. He replied sorry. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Not terrible but not great either. Let's start with ordering: I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap and asked for cheddar cheese instead of blue cheese. Also asked the server I I could do a cup of soup as my side instead of fries, etc. My soup was good but once I pulled out the entire chicken that was in my cup, I had about 4 good bites before it was empty. My wrap came out loaded with blue cheese. I sent it back, and the new one came out sloppy and unwrapped and swimming in buffalo sauce. Literally when I was done eating there was more sauce on the plate than there was soup in my bowl. The fries were mediocre at best from what I tried off my daughters plate. The bill comes, and I was charged full price for my cup of soup which I substituted for fries...the waitress should have known you cannot have soup as a side instead of fries. So basically I paid almost $4 for a teeny tiny cup of soup that was loaded with a full chicken rather than broth and paid full price for my meal and side, which I didn't even get the side. The quality of the food was good and I will give it another try once they work their kinks out."}
{"text":"This is an \"old school\" neighborhood tavern. We live two blocks away and in the distant past made this place a regular dinner experience. Back in the day, we brought the crew from work to enjoy birthdays, retirements - you know the drill. \"A.T.\" has survived some ownership/management/decor changes. We stopped going because it was not \"our thing.\" We heard that it was again \"under new management\" and our curiosity was piqued.   When we saw an ad for $5.00 off \"ANY $20.00 PURCHASE (EXCLUDING ALCOHOL)\" my darling wife cut out the ad and we headed out to try our old favorite one more time. The drafts selection has been increased in number and they did have a couple of GOOD crafts, the food is still good. I did the clam bake for $21 the middle necks were excellent, the rest was OK. When it came time to pay the bill, we put our $5.00 off \"ANY $20 PURCHASE (EXCLUDING ALCOHOL)\" coupon on the tray with my CC. The waitperson came back a few minutes later and explained that the coupon did not apply to the clambake and my wife's dinner was under the $20 so we were not granted the discount! 
It was interesting to experience out favorite one more time. It was THE LAST TIME for us."}
{"text":"The remodel is very nice.  So are the owners and staff.  Unfortunately they need to get their act together.  The burgers and fries are small and not close to what you would expect coming from a restaurant that carries the American Tavern name.
They literally put half of a slice of tomato on the burger and the thick heart of the lettuce head on the burger.  The fries need help.  Either they are using the wrong oil or cooking them at the wrong temperature.  The portion was small.  Come on they are fries.  Give me a big pile of fries.  We also ordered a patty melt.  They used so much butter that it was dripping from the rye.  The burger patty was small and again same issue with the fries.  

Here is the worst part... The chef was so hot in the kitchen, which you can see now since they put in a window that he was sweating out of control.  The last thing I want to see is a chef using a rag to wipe sweat every 2 minutes.  He even used hit sleeve amd his apron.  He pulled it up from his waste to wipe the sweat.  He needs to wear a chefs hat to obsorb the sweat and the owners need to pump cold air i to the kitchen if it's that hot.  Trust me, I was not the only one that noticed his behavior.  It wasn't even a hot night.  What's going to happen when it's 80+ outside.


I'll give them another chance since it is new and they just opened.  They do need to work on portion size,  proper method of cooking fries and the CHEF'S HYGIENE."}
{"text":"American Tavern is a local bar with a food menu that rivals any great restaurant. Their burgers rank near the top of best burger in town! The bartenders are friendly and welcoming, and the regular patrons just as much so. Prices cannot be beat and the entire atmosphere welcomes you back again and again."}
