{"text":"Excellent food for a great price. Very large portions - recommend sharing. Service was extra friendly."}
{"text":"This restaurant has closed.  Drove by just a few minutes ago and \"for lease\" signs are posted."}
{"text":"Simple menu allows for freshest ingredients and fast service. The desserts are out of this world AMAZING!!! Have dined here a couple times my my girlfriends and we loved the cleanliness of the place, and the chef personally greeted us - he was very friendly and welcoming. Those deserts alone will keep me coming. Peach cobbler with vanilla ice-cream and carrot cake was the best ones I ever had at any bakery."}
{"text":"First of all our server was great.  She was attentive and very helpful.  That's the good news.  I ordered the hamburger which was supposedly \"cooked to order.\"  I ordered it cooked \"medium,\"  The hamburger was dry and very overcooked.  Terrible.  My friend's order was much better..she got the daily special of meat loaf and she liked it and said it was good."}
{"text":"In your minds eye see your grandparents kitchen on a week day night for Supper.  You would get a homemade choice of one specialty of the house with desert. Always with desert, back in the days when you could afford physically to eat desert. You just had it.  This is that memory.  Full of love, the smell of home cooked food. Each day Robert and his lovely wife conjure up a delectable lunch item (Supper item is more like it) from scratch (it's in the name).  For now they are just back to doing lunch week-days.  The demand for dinner and Saturday breakfast was so big that they had to cut back the number of hours they were working to keep up with the customers.  Robert hand makes the hamburger patties which are always on the menu-along with hand dipped onion rings.  Each day the menu and the desert changes. You can find one homemade soup on the menu each day also.  Treat yourself to a trip to a family kitchen just for the memory alone and say a special hi to Robert and Gigi who will be treating your like family."}
{"text":"Stopped by around 7:15 PM and I was the only customer.  I chose the Chicken Alfredo with a side salad to go.  They forgot the side salad and I had to ask about it.  The gentleman that was waiting on the counter, went to the cooler and grabbed salad with his hand and put it in the to go box.  I knew at that point I wasn't ever coming back (nor eating the salad).  I just wanted out of there too because the air conditioner wasn't working on a 88 degree day.  
The Chicken Alfredo was marginal, no flavor except the chicken strips were OK.  
I had such high hopes, won't go back."}
{"text":"If you want a good dinning experience you need to check this gem out.  Very wonderful place to sit and enjoy each others company.  No loud music, people not on cell phones.  Menu very simple a daily special, sandwiches and let's not forget the desert. We went to celebrate our 29th anniversary and will definitely be back .  Good old fashion home cooked American traditional"}
{"text":"The name says it all. Everything I ate certainly tasted like it had been made from scratch at the restaurant. I had the chicken fried chicken with white gravy. It was excellent. The mashed potatoes were smooth and creamy, but not overly thought (meaning they weren't cooked with rosemary, garlic and freshly sourced, hand churned, butter; blah, blah, blah). The green beans were very good. Most restaurants don't get these right. These taste like good ole southern green beans. I also had the blackberry cobbler a la mode for dessert. I might go back sometime just for that cobbler alone. I'll def. be back."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on a whim and will definitely be going back! It looks very unassuming from the exterior and the sign can be easy to miss.  We sat at the picnic tables outside with table service from a incredibly sweet and attentive man.  The menu isn't large; basically a daily home cooked special meal and a few regular offerings. Chicken Caesar salad, chicken salad sandwich, burger and a chicken Caesar wrap which is what I ordered.  Wrap came with choice of chips or fresh fruit and was amazing. Fresh and sweet- delicious.  My husband ordered the hamburger steak (Salisbury steak to us from the North!) His meal was incredible; broccoli casserole was delicious and hamburger was hand made and cooked perfectly.  Easy to tell the food here is truly home cooked!"}
{"text":"We just happened to be driving through the area and the outside seating with umbrellas caught our eye.  We stopped and are so glad we did. Wonderful food and wonderful service.  Take the time and stop and enjoy this wonderful place!"}
{"text":"Good food and wonderful staff.  Spoke with the owner... Good people who care about serving good food along with making the customer their priority.  We  will go back."}
{"text":"Have been waiting for this restaurant to open for months now they are finally open and have been for about a month now. Glad they are here.

It's in a re purposed old house on S. Main Street just south of the intersection with Catawba Ave.  Not the first restaurant in this location because a BBQ place was here previously but they did not last long.

We walked in for Saturday brunch and were immediately seated and what used to be the front porch.  It's very attractive and make good use of bold vibrant colors to create a warm atmosphere.

Our server was excellent and he attended to our every need and request in very professional manner.

Menu is somewhat limited and this is especially true of the breakfast items.  I had the biscuits with gravy along with sausage and added hash browns as a side.  Biscuits were nice and flaky and while the gravy had a great texture, it was very bland. The sausage patties were way overcooked and it was hard to even cut them. The hash browns are not what I expected and were really cubed as opposed to shredded and also overcooked as well.

My wife had a grilled cheese sandwich off of the kids menu along with a side of fruit.  Nothing spectacular here and very middle of the road.

I suspect that if we had tried some of the items from the hearty menu items such as the grilled chicken sandwich, our results would have been better.

I also suspect that the dinner menu is somewhat better as well. This evening special was Shepherd's pie which is one of my favorite.

Till I get back and try the dinner menu, I going to just have to go with an OK rating. Food is average but what makes this place stand out is the atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"Really good down home cooking. Love that it's easy to pick up dinner when I don't have time to cook. Chicken and dumplings like Grandmas. We haven't eaten in the restaurant, but highly recommend for take out!"}
{"text":"So I ventured into this establish on their grand opening without realizing it.  The place was crazy, they were on their third wave of customers.  When I think of mom and pops joints, this is exactly the type of place that comes to mind.  Chef Gigi has been cooking for 30 years and her husband, believe it or not - his name is poppy.  If you go, keep in mind, this is a new place and they are still working the kinks out, to be expected - the kitchen was frantically trying to keep up.  Which is a good thing - right?  :-).  The place has a very Christian overtone, nothing wrong with that, but it is interesting.

Their menu is somewhat limited, two specials every night.  This is down hardcore home country cooking.  On Thursday, they serve up a hamburger steak with mushrooms, onion and gravy.  I was a good looking dish, I wish they would go with some mashed potatoes not the French Fries that I was offered.   Side note - the fresh lemonade was perfect.  They do serve up a good looking Cheeseburger dish that the table beside me ordered.

They have a Saturday brunch and a special menu for Saturday nights.  The owners seem to be great people, I hope they can make it work."}
{"text":"Everything you'd expect from a place named  \"From Scratch\". Incredibly friendly staff/family and just as incredible food. We tried just about everything on the special for the day and it was all very good. We will definitely visit this place often."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place! So cute and local. The menu is limited and somewhat awkward. However, decided on the burger which was ok. The onion rings, which I was most excited about, ended up being mostly batter that tasted of old grease. 

The worst part though was the sweet guy who was waiting on us. He had a bandage on his hand and unfortunately the wound was not properly covered, which cannot be sanitary."}
{"text":"I'm a fan.  Good food, limited daily selections, which keep it simple.  Saturday brunch is on my list to try.  Good home cooked food.  Check the daily special calendar and go on the days that fit your cravings.  I like the simplistic style."}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best burgers I've ever had. My dad and I tried this place after being recommended to us. I'm not a huge fan of the limited menu, however, the menu has a few of my favorites for staples on their everyday menu. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I got takeout from here one afternoon around lunch time. The food itself was really, really good. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Really bad! Chicken jambalaya, squash casserole. Probably the worst food I've had in a long time! How is this person a chef?"}
{"text":"The food was good but the wait was way to long and the chef ran out of chops so we waited over an hour to be served. The food was tasty but my husband almost popped when we waited like an hour and 10 minutes and then the table who cam in 30 minutes later was served before us. But food wise I thought it was very good"}
