{"text":"We love this pizza! Such an awesome change from the national chains. They use great toppings and the sauce is delicious. So glad to have them in Garfield, and definitely our new favorite neighborhood pizza place."}
{"text":"The pizza was good, my friend and I received fast and friendly service, and the menu was varied enough to keep us interested in coming back to try more. The interior is pretty old and looks like it has gotten a lot of use over the years, but it was very clean, and the food was yummy, so we will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Wow...Yum!!! Party of 7 and we waited about 1/2 an hour for all the food. Not bad even though we were the only table, they were dealing with the typical to-go orders but ours got out at a respectable clip. Here is something, co-worker is lactose intolerant and asked for his Italian sub with no cheese but it came out and our server said she forgot and would put an order in for another properly made one but it was just easier to peel the cheese off of which he did. So she said his lunch was on the house... Well done... So if you work in or around Garfield Heights pop in, very clean and my Reuben was freaken delish!!!!"}
