{"text":"Called  Prima like 10 times today and no one picked up.  I'm still gonna give you guys like 3 stars cause this is my first review of this place and the past service has been good. Still, not picking during dinner time is not cool Prima. Now I have to eat a mayonnaise sandwich."}
{"text":"Unbelievable service and the best italian I've had in Vegas!! The staff was so friendly and catering.  The food was fantastic. I had the special white pizza and a chicken salad... Pretty basic huh, but it truly stood out from any other pizza or chicken salad a have ever had After speaking with the staff I was informed that everything is freshly made in-house on premisses and nothing is frozen. You can really taste the difference here.  I can't wait to come back and try the Philly cheese steak."}
{"text":"I love Prima Pizza. The crust, sauce and toppings are oh so good. Cheese yummy!!! And the pesto pizza is killer.   We have ordered both the chicken wings and fingers. I was not a fan of either. Both were a little soggy and flavorless. The fries we got with the fingers were undercooked and soggy.   But I love the pizza here so I will for sure keep coming back.   I used to work in a pizza joint in high school and personally I think they just need to fry the fingers and fries a little longer to make them crispy."}
{"text":"I use to order from this a lot when I was living at south Vegas.  And I always been pleased with quality of food and service, my favorites were garlic knots and spinach calzone. I highly recommend this place everyone in the area"}
{"text":"The Pizza reminded me of Back home NY. Female cook hooked it up and made my pizza well done just like i asked. Ill deff be coming back for more."}
{"text":"I have ordered from this place many times! I love it! I've tried many different items on the menu and have never been disappointed! The pasta, apps, and all of the pizzas...are so good. Great customer service and decent delivery time too!"}
{"text":"This is our 2nd time getting food delivered from here and we are definitely new fans. The chicken fingers are super yummy and crispy the way we like them. Pizza was yummy, we'll be back. Delivery guy was nice and food arrived very fast,  suprisingly fast!"}
{"text":"Stay away from the pasta! I ordered their Angelhair Alfredo Chicken for lunch to go since there isn't much variety in the industrial area nearby. It grossed me out so bad. There was a piece of fat and nerve covered with sauce that I didn't notice wasn't actually meat. It was disgusting to take a bite into a weird nerve and have it squirt grease into my mouth! OMG just typing this is making me sick of re-living the moment. The sauce wasn't really alfredo either. Maybe their pizza is better but the lack of quality control on trimming the chicken turns me away from this place. I think this is the first place I have ever given one star! Ruined my lunch and rest of my work day because I was hungry after the disgust had passed. Wasted $11 and time to pick it up."}
{"text":"just had dinner there pretty good pizza 3 toppings 16inch pie 11$ pretty freaking good will tell my friends to try too definitly grab a bite from there"}
{"text":"Excellent lasagna, amazing sauce.  Hard to find though so keep an eye out for it. Definitely trying more from prima!"}
{"text":"Best chicken fingers around an the Italian dressing on any salad is the bomb.com! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the worst pizza place I have ever been to. The toppings were terrible and so was the cheese. The wings were also really bad."}
{"text":"First time ordering from Primas and it was delish! We had Cheese Pizza, Garlic Bread and Spaghetti.  Great service and the food was awesome!"}
{"text":"Do not eat at this place. I got sick after they \"fixed\" the order they screwed up. Poor service. Extremely poor management."}
{"text":"Nice friendly staff and owner, pizza is good and the ingredients are fresh. It's way better then dominos but not as good as mark rich's. This place is quick 10 minutes for a pie and its good pizza in a hurry."}
{"text":"I don't review often but have to give credit where credit is due.... these are good people and some of the best pizza anywhere!!"}
{"text":"Everything my wife and I have tried here was really good. From the pizza to the fried ravioli.  They deliver quickly and the price is fair. The only reason they get four star's is because of the marinara.  A little to sweet for me, but still not bad. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I  first sampled a taste of Prima's food at a work function, which is why I sought out the cafe for dinner with my roomie.  We were greeted warmly as we entered, and went to the counter and ordered an albanian sald and a buffalo chicken pizza. We did notice that there were several specials . My roomie asked if there were pitchers of soda because she drinks a lot during dinner. The waitress laughed and said \"we do free refills\"  We sat down at a table and The waitress ended up bringing another soda to the table , and told my roomie \"Oh I thought you might be close to needing another\"   Anticipation of needs is awesome service if you ask me!! The Albanian salad  was absolutely delicious. It had grilled eggplant and tomato , feta  cheese other veggies . it was fresh and they served it with homemade dressings . We tried bot hthe balsamic and the ranch.  Our pizza came and it was fresh and hot and  completely YUM.  We had so much food that we had to take leftovers home.  I will totally be back as I want another salad. I am also thinking I want to try the pasta."}
{"text":"Start of our adventure on 2/4/13 at 8. No bottled water, no ice, no mushrooms, lack of attentive service, 30 minutes and still waiting. How are you even in business ? I honestly think fire the owner, or change out managment."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating there. All I can cas is AMAZING! some of the best pizza I have found in Las Vegas. Will definatly be eating there again!!"}
{"text":"The delivery service on Yelp app was the first ding, placed order, 1 hour later just called to get a ETA and they never even got the order let alone offer delivery .. So delivery seems to be a clerical error. I??   So i placed order over phone and was told 20-25 minutes, showed up in 30 and sat for another 20,  that was the 2nd ding...was hoping the food would be worth the wait and in all honesty in the end the food was not good at all, from the quality and proportions were half of even average and cold after my 3 minute drive home . Sorry to say will not return and it's a shame because I could walk there , and would frequent them if was at least decent."}
{"text":"Best pizza, fingers and motz stix in the area, hands down. Love this place, even the Philly cheesesteak from here is killer. Really, you can't go wrong here"}
{"text":"Pretty solid pizza on all counts: good thin crust, tasty sauce, real cheese. I like my pie a little more well done than they usually cook theirs but that is not a big deal at all. Definitely the best pie in the SW. The staff are also all super friendly."}
{"text":"The first time we ate food from here we had it delivered and it was the most delicious pizza I have ever tasted here in Las Vegas. The dough and sauce is fresh.  Today we had dinner there and we had a medium vegetarian Stromboli and a Mediterranean salad and we ate inside the restaurant.  The restaurant is very clean, service was good and food was fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"I ordered their Chicken Marsala($10.99) with a Pepsi($1.25) total was $13 PROS: -Chicken Marsala came with garlic knots and a salad, which took me by surprise as I wasn't expecting anything than the pasta I ordered -Since I was the ONLY person eating there, service was quick and attentive lol -The pasta was good enough for two -Food overall was pretty tasty  CONS: -I wish you could order pizza by the slice  -HAIR IN MY PASTA! I was freaked out and couldn't eat anymore.  So if the people at Prima Pizza & Cafe are reading this, have your cooks at least wear a hairnet!"}
{"text":"Best Chicken Parm sandwich I have had in years. We ordered the Chicken Parm sandwich and the Hot Italian Sausage and both were phenomenal. The first thing I noticed when the delivery guy, nice fellow, handed me the food was the weight, these are some substantial sandwiches. The only thing I have to say negative is I told them on the phone to go easy on the marina and if this was easy I hate to see what normal looks like. I ended up taking most of hte sauce off with a spoon so it wouldnt turn the bread into mush. The bread itself tasted and felt like it was freshly baked and was easily as good as the contents, the chicken appeared to be the real deal not the composted chiken patties some places try to pass off and the sausages were whole links not the ground up bits I have had from other places. All in all two thumbs up on their sandwichs, low cost great value and delivered hot and tasty. We will repeat in the future."}
{"text":"Prima's pizza is decently priced, but it is so bland and GREASY!  I would rather buy something from the grocery store if I just wanted some cheap pizza."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is terrible! No music playing, no tvs no literature to read and whoever the guy with the blonde hair and go is just sits in the corner on his laptop. He did get up to take my order when I got here but his social skills are the worst! I had to ask him to repeat himself at least twice because he doesn't annunciate. The calzone wasn't anything to write home about either."}
{"text":"Hands down, some of the most wonderful people you will meet. The service and the food is high quality. We have some inconsistent, average pizza/Italian places around the 89139, but this is definitely not one of them. I order from here at a minimum of twice a week. I've tried the majority of their menu and have had nothing below four stars. The price is very generous. They also provide some of the best new york style pizza in the south-west."}
{"text":"Prima has a friendly staff, great pizza, and fresh ingredients. You can get a large cheese pizza for $8.99, with $1.50 toppings. That's about the same price as a DiGiorno. They also have giant salads, which are easily split between two people."}
{"text":"He's a rude motherphucker!!  lol  Seriously, doesn't know how to say hello to his customers or acknowledge a \"thank you\".  I'll use him in a pinch, but there is so much better pizza out there from people that at least attempt to be personal.  Anywho, it's cheap if you carry out.  Otherwise, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Had the wings. Good flavor, not that spicy. The jumbo wings were by no means scrawny. Great value though, 40 wings for $25 is pretty good."}
{"text":"I have been a few times doubt I'll be back. It is true there is a funny smell & the air doesn't work or something this must be why they keep the doors open all day. This lets lil nats & dust in. Pizza is ok nothing to special , grocery store produce toppings. Yes it is different and Ny style. I've had better it's ok for the $. Everything else in the restaurant is lacking. Cashier first day ( we all have one I understand ) charged me for the wrong salad. I let him know , delivery driver fixed it. Then get home and my salad isn't made right & pale yellow wilted. I call I am told that was made by the owner sorry they are out of romaine. Why did no one tell me?  Why on a Tuesday afternoon are you out of a main ingredient for half your salads? Was it so wilted? Why when I called you made an excuse & did not offer to fix it? Not impressed"}
{"text":"Pretty bomb! 2 slices and a large drink for 5 $ not bad. great pizza... check it out brahz"}
{"text":"\"Home made\"  this is used on menus more than it should be. In this case it is justified. The cheese sticks and chicken fingers are home made. They weren't great but anyplace that puts in the effort gets points in my book.   Now as for the pizza..... I'll break it down into 3 parts   Toppings.  The meat balls are delicious and may be homemade as well. And I love that they use sausage crumbles not the processed chunks most other places do.  We got a philly steak and feta pizza as well and it was amazing.    The crust here is nice and thin with a crispy bottom. New York style and delicious.   I absolutely love the sauce here it's a thin sauce with strong hints of garlic and basil.  Prima's is currently my favorite pizza in vegas."}
{"text":"-1 Star for poor service, -2 Stars for bad food! I got 2 slices of pizza, I asked the guy if I should come back in 10-15 minutes, which means I'm not in a hurry. He tells me to wait another 2 minutes and that should have been my res flag. The pizza was under cooked! The cheese was not melted, the pepperoni was raw and the dough was not fully cooked. I didn't see until I got home, what a waste of my time and what a shame. The guy that works the cashier doesn't seem to like his job. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"When Prima first opened, there was nothing on their menu that was bad. Everything was on point and that's what kept us coming back. However, the food hasn't been on point recently, they've often get our orders wrong, they've discontinued a few items on the menu. We've slowly been weening away.  We wish they weren't falling off of their game."}
{"text":"This rating is primarily for the food and effort to remedy mistakes.  The pizza was this great combination of flavor, toppings and the perfect amount of grease! The wings were small but had a good flavor. I ordered hot but they were a medium at best. The garlic bread was tasty as well.  The mistakes. I ordered online and there was an issue from the start when it said my order was going to be ready in 4 minutes. Apparently eat24 noticed so they called the restaurant several times and didn't get an answer so they called and asked me how to proceed. On my 2nd follow up call someone answered and my bf went to pick up the order. He got there and the pizza wasn't an extra large and they were out of a topping. They should have called me and asked if I wanted a replacement since I paid for 4 toppings but whatever. They gave him the price difference refund, a free coke and a few ranch and called it even. The online special price was apparently no longer active so next time I'll just call in my order directly to location and that should remedy the issues....hopefully. They were apologetic and kind so thanks to the quality we will be back."}
{"text":"The stars are mostly for the excellent service. Delivery was super fast, staff was courteous and the online menu made ordering easy. The food, however... Eh, it's ok, no big deal, but not bad either."}
{"text":"I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo and added shrimp and spinach......absolutely terrible!!!! The sauce was extremely bland, no flavor at all and it was also very watery. I even added salt and pepper and that didn't help one bit and the shrimp still had the shell on it lol. I called to speak to a manager not even 10 mins after the delivery was received and was told there was no one available to help me. I could either leave a message or call back TOMORROW MORINING, mind you its 2:00 pm. Where is the management? And why aren't they available to handle such situations. Is the crew running the restaurant alone?  With a restaurant background, this is just completely unheard of. First and last time ordering from this place!!! What a waste of $20!!!! You got me prima pizza! Congratulations. BTW stop leaving flyers on my door. Thanks :)"}
{"text":"Food wasn't ready on time. Found BURNT PLASTIC, in my sandwich. Garlic bread was stuck to top of box. Pizza was beyond burnt. Besides all that, the food wasn't even that tasty (the parts without plastic or cardboard attached). I would never ever recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! I forget about it since I moved n now I'm closer to another great pizza place, wish they delivered where I live, which is rainbow and spring mountain. Hint hint. Lol Their white pizza is my favorite!!!! I usually order a Caesar salad with my pizza and it's yummy too! But man, I really love that white pizza! I might have to go there tomorrow!!!  Cute little hidden gem. You gotta check it out for sure if you like traditional hand tossed pizza! I've had other pizzas there and they all have been amazing!"}
{"text":"Called for late night delivery to our offices.   Very pleasant on the phone, promised delivery in about 40 minutes. We ordered two pizzas, some entrees and drinks. The food was all pretty good (this from a picky ex-NYer) and delivery came when promised.  They threw in garlic bread and extra salad dressing too.  Entrees seemed like a small container but about halfway through, we were full.  We'd order again from them (and probably will).  One minor nitpick - they forgot utensils, but we found some."}
{"text":"I went here my first time recently, upon walking in to pick up a pizza, the owner was swapping cash with his delivery driver behind the counter and wouldn't even acknowledge me while standing there. When he finally looked up, I said I was there to pick up a pizza and he said in a derogatory way 'Oh really?'. His customer service was horrible and his employees looked very unhappy and down-trodden. Upon trying the pizza at home, it was very mediocre, and very greasy. I am never going back!"}
{"text":"place is joke. Our pizza came out like crap and wouldn't even refund me or give us a new pizza for the inconvenience. Trust me stick to Pizza Hut or dominos. ANYTHING Is better then this s***."}
{"text":"Since we just moved to LV, we have been trying to find a good pizza place, and I think we found it in Prima.  We ordered delivery, and it was great.  The delivery came a lot faster than we anticipated, quicker than they quoted and fast for a Saturday evening.  The pizza itself was tasty, as was the dinner salad.  I was slightly disappointed in the garlic knots - although they give you a dozen, they aren't very flavorful & leave some garlic taste to be desired.  Check out their specials on their website - they offer great deals for all sized parties.  It was even good the next day.  We will be trying out Prima in the future."}
{"text":"We ordered the supreme pizza and caprese salad. The salad was 95% lettuce and 5% combined tomatoes and mozzarella cheese and barely any dressing. The pizza was not that good. It was quite greasy, did not have a lot of sauce on it and really did not have much taste to it. We dined in, and the pizza was brought out to us, and I had to go to the counter to ask for plates. It was also very warm inside the place. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite wing spots! The pizza always tastes great, and they have good deals too."}
{"text":"This review is based on delivery/service. Tried ordering through yelp/eat 24 and actually had to cancel my order due to them not delivering my order after an hour and a half since order had been \"confirmed.\" I tried calling them multiple times and no one picked up. Had to cancel my order through eat24."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here a few times. First time I picked up, second time we had it delivered. I like the White Pizza. It's pretty delicious. The garlic bread is yummy, the calzone was gigantic and filled with all kinds of delicious meats. We will definitely order again."}
{"text":"So delicious ! Just got an 18\" pep delivered and so glad we did. The dough is perfection, nice thin pizza. Totally NY style!"}
{"text":"They make everything from scratch.  Nice variety on the menu and the food is reasonably priced.  Hands down my favorite Italian spot in Vegas! Friendly staff..."}
{"text":"I don't know how you can ever order food here because they NEVER ANSWER THEIR PHONE. I have called four times and the phone just rings into oblivion!!! I'll take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm new to the area so I decided to try this place out and I was not disappointed. Very very good pizza, very nice staff, and the cashier/server super nice and friendly!! Been there twice already and plan on returning again and again!!"}
{"text":"Our Thursday night ritual is pizza at home. New to this part of town, we have tried all the chain pizza places for delivery. Last night we decided to try a more mom and pop type of place. I placed the phone order after browsing the menu on Prima Pizza's website. The person who took my order was friendly. The pizza arrived in the allotted 40 minute time frame that was given. The delivery driver was extra pleasant. We were surprised to find crushed peppers and Parmesan packs in the pizza boxes-- SCORE!  My vegetarian pizza was colorful and filled with veggies. My bf's pepperoni pizza was a bit greasy, but that is to be expected with meat AND cheese. I felt like Prima's pizza was made with love, not just another order that needed to be filled. I think this will be our pizza place on Thursday nights.  Gotta go, my left over pizza is done warming up- :)"}
{"text":"Hands down best food in town. I've tried everything on the menu and it all is better than the rest. My favorite is the meatball pizza with onion and oregano."}
{"text":"Ninja Edit: I tried them again. Had a great experience. Original score was a 2 I upgraded them to a 3. Try the wings.  Original Post  I have ordered from Prima Pizza half a dozen times now. All but this last experience was enjoyable. This review covers what just happened 20 minutes ago.   I stop in and order the 12\" Prima Pizza. The pizza that holds the name of the establishment. After a 1 minute drive home I find that my pizza has turned to soup. All the toppings slid off and I am left with one quarter of an edible pizza. I packed up my pizza soup and promptly returned it. To their credit they refunded my money without any fuss.   I would suggest people give this place a try. Just be sure to check your product before you walk out the door."}
{"text":"Pretty decent little joint. Came here on a saturday night. No one was there. Seems to be more a take out joint. The service was good. Not your typical sit down restaurant so don't expect that....  The pizza was okay. Nice crumbled sausage, somewhat crisp crust.  The pasta. Pesto cream with tortellini and sweet sausage. Loved the sauce.  I could see the extreme amount of garlic put into there.  Would I come here again? Eh, it's a bit far for me... If I lived nearer, I'd possible do delivery. Possibly."}
{"text":"Great service. Food was done quickly. Not too many patrons but more people need to try this place. I'll definitely be back  The cheese was seasoned & perfect."}
{"text":"Deliver was quite fast, but the driver was really rude, my total was around $25.41 and I got exactly the correct amount, but was told it was $25.68, upon being told this, I told him I was gonna go find a few more cents until he gave me back my change and told me \"Don't order pizza, unless you can afford\", truly horrible customer service. No patience, and guy was hostile."}
{"text":"So far so good! I didn't feel like leaving the house so I wanted to order a pizza from a place that delivers. The options are very limited in Southern Highlands. Thanks to Yelp, I called Prima Pizza & Cafe and found out they delivered to my area.  I ordered an 18 inch Pesto Chicken Pizza, with tax and delivery charge it came out to roughly $21. Not too bad. They said the pizza would be delivered in 45 minutes. The order came on time and the pizza smelled so appetizing!  I liked the crust and loved that the pizza came with fresh tomato and big chunks of chicken. I would've preferred more pesto sauce, but otherwise, I was very happy with my order. I would definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Outstanding Italian Food.& Pizza! They have take-out or eat in. Haven't had anything that I didn't enjoy. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I don't usually leave reviews but felt like I needed to. I ordered a steak philly and it was burnt and dry. My husband got a chicken Philly and he said his was super dry too. At least his bun wasn't burnt. Got a pizza for the kids and it was ok. No flavor in the crust at all. Won't order from here again."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken Parmesan sandwich with fries for about $8.75 (including tax).  Omg this was good.  Notice the size of the sandwich and the amount of fries ($1.00 more)."}
{"text":"This pizza is really not my style (it has that extra greasy NY pizza appeal), but my boyfriend really likes the way they do their garlic pizza.   HOWEVER, this place has dreadful customer service and is very unprofessional. Upon calling in an order the phone has been answered with \"Sup\", \"Yeah\", and other various mumbles. There have been sighs, grunts and grumbles when asking about specials or pricing. No names are taken. You are not greeted when walking in. No one here even pretends to give a hoot about the customer.   A business can't run based on product quality alone, especially if it only appeals to a certain crowd. I hope someone realizes that they need put more care into this place or it's doomed."}
{"text":"Some local shitty pizza place put a flyer on my door, and I almost called them tonight before I checked their reviews on Yelp.  They were a 2*.  So I did a search for local pizza places with delivery, and Prima came up.  Called them up and asked if they had a minimum.  No minimum, so I ordered a medium White Pizza.  They told me 30-45 minutes, and the guy was at my door in less than 30.  And my apartment is hard to find!  Pizza was good, loaded with all the cheese I was looking forward to.  Definitely not the best pizza I've ever had, but it was pretty high up there in delivery pizza options at a reasonable price.  Thanks, Prima!"}
{"text":"Was good when it first opened but has gone a bit down hill in the last couple of years. Chicken wings suffered the most. Really pathetic!"}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken cutlet sandwich from here which is pretty hard to mess up but they put too much mayo on it and the chicken wasn't all that good either. I also ordered mozzarella sticks and I took a small bite didn't want to touch the rest they look disgusting and they were also cold. On another note they did manage to deliver the food in a timely manner. Probably won't be ordering from here again though. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious lasagna Drillin was super nice ! I'll definately be back for more. Newly remodeled and looks great inside"}
{"text":"Since we moved in our house down the street from this place, we've been getting flyers in the mail with coupons, so I thought I'd try it.. so glad I did!! I had a coupon for a 16 inch cheese pizza, 1 topping (I added onions), carryout, for $8.99. The girl I talked to when I placed my order over the phone was very friendly. She said it'd be ready in about 15 minutes. I think the same girl that took my order over the phone was the same girl that rang me up. Very, sweet and friendly. With tip, I paid about $12 for this pizza and it was frickin delicious!! Papa John's is usually our go-to spot for pizza, but no more.. this pizza was a lot better than PJ or Pizza Hut. Will DEFINITELY be returning, and am excited to try other stuff on their menu. Very decently priced, also. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"the pizza took 50 min to get here and it was cold! i mean hard cheese, had to microwave it, cold. errr."}
{"text":"The delivery driver was rude, rude, rude! to say the very least.  The pizza was paid for when  ordered.  The driver was trying to get credit card information even though it was explained several times the order was paid for when placed.  His response was \"F***k\" this and that, this is BS, they do this to me every \"f***g\" time.  No food is worth this kind of treatment, very hostile."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I order delivery from here 1-2 times a week (don't judge lol) and I have never once been disappointed. I have tried various pizzas and my favorites are the Prima pizza as well as the garlic chicken. Before I moved to this area I used to order from your average Pizza Hut and after experiencing Prima multiple times I wouldn't even think about getting it from somewhere else. As a die hard pizza fan, this place definitely has my stomach."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!! Their pizza is great with a flakey crust! The customer service is very warm and welcoming and they have a huge menu! Everything we ate was delicious!!!  I will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Usually I feel ashamed to get delivery from Dominos or Pizza Hut, but Prima Pizza is my one exception.  This family owned restaurant is owned by Italians who know exactly what they're doing.  Their hot wings are oh so crispy and good.  They also have an all you can eat soup, salad, and garlic knots for $6.99 everyday!  Favorite pizzas so far are: #1] PESTO CHICKEN - Sundried tomatoes, basil pesto sauce, & grilled chicken. #2] GARLIC CHICKEN - garlic, onion, mozzarella, & grilled chicken. #3] WHITE PIZZA- provolone, ricotta, feta, mozzarella, & roasted garlic.  Their crusts & sauces are ridiculously yummy and are what I find to be the most important components to a pizza.  Though, pizza is pizza, I don't mind eating an entire 12\" pizza and wings here, all to my lonesome. Ingredients are fresh and you can just taste the difference."}
{"text":"My girlfriend took me here because she really likes the pizza.  It's okay for the price but \"you get what you pay for\".  She likes it because the crust is doughy.  I don't like it because the toppings are grocery store quality.  This is a small place kind of hidden away.  We went on a Saturday night and the place was empty.  It was 60 degrees outside and they had entry double doors propped wide open making it really cold inside.  I only think they did this to cool it off for the cooks (but they are not busy cooking anything) but it goes to show you they'd rather make themselves comfortable at the cost of the customers.  Also, as we sat and tried to enjoy our pizza we could hear the loud lady that took our order dropping F bombs in a conversation she was having with another coworker.  Not Professional at all."}
{"text":"I was there last night the best pizza I have had in years.   The service was great .  Can't wait to go back next Friday night."}
{"text":"LOOOOVVVEEE the pizza and the price is phenomenal! I always get the large sausage pizza for $7.99. I moved across town and miss this place. The dough seems to have a hint of sugar in it which just tastes so damn good. Top 3 best pizzas I ever had and that's def saying a lot. I tried there meatball sub which was really really bad but if you love pizza you def have to try this place"}
{"text":"I love this place! I've had their pizza, salads, and pastas and they are  all so yummy. When I eat in or pick up the staff is always so nice. Sometimes I walk my dog over ( I live right down the road) and they'll bring him water and some snacks. Their marinara sauce is kind of sweet which I love. The mozzarella they use in their caprese salad is so fresh. I'm a huge fan of tiramisu and theres is the best I've had in a long time. The only bad thing I can say is they took garlic knots off their menu!! They were delish and I hope they bring them back!!"}
{"text":"Not terrible but not worth while.  The times I came here were satisfying my hunger, but not my taste buds as much as I'd like.  At times in the early afternoon I've noticed a huge laziness from particular employees.  So the process of cooking the food felt rushed and thus my food, as a result, not as delectable and dry.   The pizza is pretty good, and so are some of their pastas.  If you're in the area and have tried everything but Prima, try it out."}
{"text":"Very good palce to eat near by my house. Chic    paramzon sandwich was deliciousand veg pizza aswell. Will b there wen crave for some pizza and sandwich"}
{"text":"I feel blessed this place is so close to my house...walking distance...awesome family...great pizza..."}
{"text":"I've been trying to find a delicious pizza place on the southwest side for a while now and it just so happens that Prima is right around the corner from my place.  Prima is casual, yet taste upscale and I can't even begin to tell you how good their chicken wings are. The right amount of crunch and size. I recommend the chef special: the hot and BBQ mix.  (that was my review from my first time there)  After a few more visits my rating went from a 5 to 3 - the wings the 2nd time were terrible. They tasted old and were drenched in sauce and to top it off - the worker there was a complete 180 from the first experience. It was like a whole new restaurant. Overall it's okay, the pizza is still good, but the experience has been a bit inconsistent."}
{"text":"I love this place. One of my favorite pizza places in town. They have great pizzas, calzones, and pastas. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Besides the fact that the owner was COMPLETE jerk! The food was the definition of underwhelming. This is the third and last time I will ever eat here. My first time the owner said they are known for their wings. I really hope that isn't the case because I'd rather go to Albertsons for wings over what i was served. I will give them that their pizza was decent. I just wouldn't specifically go their is I wanted pizza. In a pinch it will do."}
{"text":"Their white pizza is legit amazinggggg!!  Quick, efficient delivery service here.  We'll be ordering more often for sure!  Great products for a great price."}
{"text":"i love the pizza here they give plenty of cheese and toppings,not the healthiest food but when i need something that taste awesome i go order the 8.99 one topping carry out pizza usually with chicken or beef"}
{"text":"This place is close to my home, but I would travel across town for it. Great calzones, pizza, pasta, etc.  I recently took two calzones that were half cooked to a friend's house and finished cooking them there. The lovely staff provided me a garlic butter topping for extra crispiness, and proper cooking instructions.  Great food, better service, and a family friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"We searched for two hours on Yelp and the Internet for a Pizza Place with decent reviews and that delivered!!  It's obvious that people are passionate about their pizza, review's for each place were 1 star to 5 star (for the same place, LOL)  We visit Las Vegas quite often, and will be ordering from here again!    The pizza was delicious, we ordered the Mexican Pizza with Sausage and thin crust, well done!  It was perfect!!  Sourdough crust, which we love!!   We also ordered the Buffalo Wings (hot), and they were great!!!  Right amount of heat and loved the crunch!!  Delivery was just about right on time!  I'll give it to them, they had to get into the building! (Resort)  Oh and very friendly, on the phone and the delivery guy who could have been frustrated getting in but was very pleasant!!"}
{"text":"Nice little place with great good. Have yet to try the pizza but the pasta was great with large servings that can function as family style servings. We had the chicken Parmesan and Albanian chicken. Delicious! The employees are very pleasant and Tiffany took great care of us.   It is a bit hidden and can be difficult to find. The directions generated through yelp on my phone told me it on the opposite side of the street where a housing tract is. This cafe is located on the east side of Jones behind a convenience store. Try it out. I was pleasantly surprised and will no longer ignore the menu fliers for delivery that show up on the porch."}
{"text":"Ordered the 7.99 large pickup special and also some chicken fingers.  Thought the pizza was excellent.  The chicken fingers were nothing special but from reading reviews that's not one of their more popular items anyways.  Will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty good.  Garlic fries were horrible. It had no garlic whatsoever.  Will never order again."}
{"text":"We are visiting from LA and are so excited to have found this wonderful place!  Delicious!!! Courteous & informational!! Last night, I called about 30 minutes before they closed & I asked the lady on the phone all kinds of questions about the menu & certain foods, she was so nice and didnt sound irritated at all (im sure they get lots of tourists asking all kinds of questions).  And I got the biggest piece of the most scrumptious chocolate cake ever! so good!  Oh and did I mention, its a great breakfast pizza too! YUM!"}
{"text":"I ordered here based on location (I live 2m away walking distance) and the decent reviews on Yelp. Don't waste your money here. I ordered a large pepperoni and cheese pizza. As soon as I got home, picked up a slice and everything just started coming off the pizza. Quality of the food isn't good, will never come back. I rather go to Little Caesars and get me a large pepperoni for $5 and taste 10x better!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here three times and every time the food is amazing. I have had pizza and pasta and the chicken spinach Stromboli. I loved it all. If you like sweets the chocolate cake is delicious.  The garlic knots are amazing. The staff is friendly and attentive. Great place to eat.  Update: The food is still amazing...I recommend any of the pasta dishes...but I am sad to report that the garlic knots are no longer on the menu. The knots have been replaced with garlic bread."}
{"text":"When I do not feel like cooking, I look adoringly at my husband and ask, \"Prima tonight?\" He sometimes counter with \"Why not Dominos?\" (he's a cheapskate) but most of the time, Prima wins the battle.   I very much enjoy their Buffalo Chicken Pizza. Prima's was the first I've had of the type, and while I've ventured out and tried many others -- nothing is like there's. The giant chicken pieces, the right blend of sauce and cheese - I'm a big fan.  Husband loves the stomboli pinwheels, the regular stromboli and calzones (funny enough he still doesn't know the difference between the two).  We both like their philly cheesesteaks. While it's not life-changing, it definitely gets top marks for a delivery establishment.  There have been some items that we won't order again (a lot of the pastas like the chicken picatta, francese) and stay away from their fries it's not even worth the buck. Also, we weren't big fans of some of the pizzas - the mexican on, the alfredo pizza... we just stick with what we know is great.  Their delivery service is pretty consistent. We've never waited longer than 45 minutes and usually get the food within 30 minutes.  We've never had a problem. Would recommend to anyone looking for an alternative to the popular pizza delivery chains."}
{"text":"I went to this place for the endless pasta bowl and found out they do not have it anymore (I should mention they did it for us as a courtesy after I mentioned that was the reason for my visit). Having said that, here is my in-depth review ;-)  * Service: Very friendly waitress! She was accommodating and always had a smile on despite the fact we were a large party and had tons of questions for her.  * Food:  Tasty. We had the meat-lovers pizza, pasta with bolognese sauce, pasta with pesto cream sauce, pasta with vodka sauce and a chicken pizza and it was all pretty good (with the exception of the pesto cream sauce--bland).  * Overall experience (the reason for the 3 stars): The place had a funny smell to the point where they had to open the front door to air out the dining area. This place is NOT good for eat-in customers as it is clearly a take-out place. Despite the willingness and great attitude of the girl taking care of us we had to wait a bit for the food, our first order of garlic bread was cold and the second order of garlic bread came after we had finished our food.  Conclusion: I would try this place again but ONLY for carry out or delivery."}
{"text":"Are you guys closed for good?  I've called a few times over past few weeks and nobody answers...."}
{"text":"The last time I ordered here I was less than pleased with the pizza.  It's been pretty undercooked, and now that I've tried the rest of the menu and have explored other places in town, I'm not sure that this is my favorite anymore.  The wings are usually pretty soft even though I order them extra crispy, and are not too spicy.    The salads however, are pretty good for a pizza joint.  Salad is my preferred meal here now, as the grilled chicken is some of the best I have had."}
{"text":"I've only ordered the wings and pizza. We usually get the carry out 1 topping special. Can't beat the price and the pizza is pretty decent. A little greasy but not bad considering it's close by and super convenient."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Pasta is out of this world pizza is fantastic and the lamb burger is stunning. Come here all of the time. They have great desserts too including a delicious piece of chocolate cake."}
{"text":"Ok so when you walk into this place once again a place in Vegas that has Cafe in their name yet is not Café style whatsoever. Now their Pizza, although very greasy is pretty good. It is when I venture off and try their other menu items that I get so disappointed. Philly.Cheesesteak is flavorless as any Philly I have ever had. There is no salt or.seasoning on the meat at all and the onions, YUCK. This is another restaurant IMPOSSIBLE For me.  When I asked the guy what the difference was between all of the cheesesteaks as they offer several choices, he shook his Head telling me they were all the same when clearly that was not the case. The Blonde gentleman did not have any customer service what so ever. The Lady who usually works there is nice but you can tell she'd rather be somewhere else. As the niceness comes off as a I have to be nice and not a I want to be nice kind of attitude. If I ever order from here again it will only be pizza. I would love to try their pasta but I am scared to! I am afraid to eat flavorless mush! In my opinion it needs a REDESIGN N the Chef needs to be trained to cook with Love!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with my family. The first visit was great. Had some pizza and pasta dishes. The subsequent visits were less impressive. They seem to always be out of something (Lids for sodas etc ). Tonight they didn't have soda cups. So they gave us little plastic water cups. I'm pretty sure we were charged for the large to go cups that they usually serve. If we needed refills we had to go to the counter to ask. Once the food was out, that's pretty much where the service stopped. The people who run the place are nice, but customer service is really lacking. Their \"office\" is set up on a table in the dining area. Laptop, books, etc etc. the food is ok. Not my favorite. Stay away from the chicken fingers. They are crispy critters when they get to you, and leave a lot to be desired. Chicken wings are decent though. I have no desire to return, the Beach Cafe next door is much better."}
{"text":"So I'm updating my review after ordering from here several times. The first time, my hubs had a hair in his food and my chicken parmesan was pretty bad, chicken was dry and sauce too sweet. Since then, out of sheer desperation we've ordered from them and it's been decent. My hubby likes their chicken wings, they are grilled not fried. (personally I like them fried) I still don't love this place, but their food is ok. I wish, as a Pasta place they would do something about their marinara/bolognese. I love some good spaghetti and meatballs or chicken parm as comfort food, and their red sauce is just too sweet. Other than that, their pizzas are pretty good. I will say when I was there in person the first time, they were very, very friendly."}
{"text":"You get a lot of food for your money. So if you are ordering a sandwich it's enough for two. Chef salad very fresh and delicious. Fast service. Staff is very friendly, especially Drilling (yes that is not a typo, but actually his name). You know this is a true pizza place when staff speaks Italian. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from here for a while. Pretty quick delivery, great service, and I recommend the pesto pizza! The crust isn't thick, it's perfectly thin and soft and crunchy! And food is always consistently good."}
{"text":"I don't live in the hood near prima pizza and cafe but I go out of my way to stop in from time to time because the people are always friendly and the menu is HUGE. I always pick something different and I'm always satisfied with the quality of ingredients and presentations.  I have been going there since they opened about three years ago and I know how particular they are and feel about where they purchase the ingredients and most of it is handmade.  I usually tantalize my taste buds with the extremely good Albania pizza specialties but tonight I ordered a specialty calzone and sampler appetizer plate. The company changed their cheese sticks to rock my world and onion rings to fresh and satisfying.  The canzone had mega cheese and nice hunks of vegetables,  so healthy. The red dipping marinara was delicious as usual. I can't wait to go back and say hi again. The only beef I have is the decor. It's pretty and all but I like more decoration.  Did I mention the best Espresso in town? See you soon Prima Pizza!!"}
{"text":"This is now my go to place for delivery pizza. Also, $7.99 for a 16\" 1-topping pizza for carryout. The pizza is great and the wings are pretty good too. Service is friendly and fast. Note: There is a $2.00 delivery charge."}
{"text":"I got the Primo sandwich and it was terrible. They only put ham and 1 slice of salami! I don't know how this place considers themselves ITALIAN!"}
