{"text":"Love to come here each time I'm in Vegas. Their tortas de asada and sope are my favorite. Lots of meat always. Salsa verde on point. Perfect for midnight food runs.   Plus : drive thru"}
{"text":"this location sucks bad food shady restaurant this place is falling apart more and more everyday the drive thru speaker has been broken for years so what does that tell you stay away"}
{"text":"2 times I've ordered over the phone has not gone well . I always order 10 minutes before lunch , since I only got 30 minutes . So first time I ordered said if would be 10 minutes so I got there 20 after still waited for another 20 minutes I got my refund . Today I order , arrive to pick up order and hasn't been made because girl forgot to give cook order , then she laughs likes its funny I. Done with this place . A bunch of ding dongs"}
{"text":"Late nights and good eats for me at this Mexican spot.  I work at a club on the strip and after work I hit up Tacos Mexico before I head home. It's a must!! I will tell you though the only thing I eat here is the tacos. I usually get five and most of the time it's the carne asada. You can usually judge a Mexican spot by how good the carne asada tacos are and how they are prepared and this spot is THE spot to get some good, authentic tacos during the nighttime hours. Corn tortilla, meat of choice, onions, cilantro and salsa, what else you need? NADA. I will say that the patsor is only okay and the chicken is not that great, haven't tried anything else there. Stick to the carne asada and you'll be good. They also got a drive thru which is a plus and there usually is a line of cars bout 3 deep at 4 in the mornin.  Oh and the other thing is the location... Its on Tropicana near the strip. In other words - the \"track\" - so if these tacos is not satisying enough you can get you some nasty tacos from the random girls walking down the street at any time of the night!"}
{"text":"Pretty terrible food.  Salsa had no flavor, just heat.  Would not recommend. Would not eat here even if I lived next door."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim drove by so many times glad I did was really good ! Kids loved it too :)"}
{"text":"I ordered a Carne Asada burrito and it wasn't good at all. The beef and rice tasted like they been under the light the whole morning. The food wasn't fresh at all. I'm very disappointed since I've been craving a Burrito for a while and this place didn't meet the expectations."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Waiting on line like 10 min , they only have 1 car and 1 customer . This is ridiculous"}
{"text":"This restaurant is ok. I usually go here when i am walking or dont want to go all the way to pepes tacos. I usualky get the burrito..which is tasty and big as hell. The quality of the meat is not great. I have actually bought food and it was good and couple hours later the meat spoiled. Fish tacos are tacky,basically fish sticks ,soft burrito and tatersauce and there you go. The nachos are good but becomes a soggy mess very quicky but they are passable. Its just ok, i used to comes often when i first moved downtown but then i found better. The staff and nice and alwats have smiles on there face. Seeing them kind of makes up for the fact that outside everytime i go,there is a homeless man standing by the dog harrassing you for money. They even come in and come up to you while you are in line or waiting.."}
{"text":"Worst tacos Mexico, I have ever been, where do I start, from the moment I walked in staff is unfriendly, like they dont want to be there. They charge me wrong, my asada plate was cold by the time I got it, have you ate cold meat? You can taste the grease, tortillas hard and stuck together, had to peeled them apart, not fun, had to ask for spoon and napkings, they dont stock their self help area often...overall BAD...when you come to a place hungry, you expect good food, I left discussed...they should close this place, if they dont take care of it..only person I give props is the busgirl, mopping, cleaning, sweeping...she did her job right"}
{"text":"Love tacos Mexico., I usually just the carne asada tacos, but if you want it to taste like it was home cooked and not fast food come here!  Always fresh, I just wish there was a location closer to the northwest where I live. They only take cash as well."}
{"text":"2nd time visiting this place. 5 stars for the Tacos!! Delicious little packages of flavour especially the pollo pibil, chorizo, and the frijoles; all are topped with a generous sprinkling of white onion & cilantro. And cheap too! Our take out order was ready quickly and the service was pleasant."}
{"text":"It was getting late. I ousted a good yawn and my eyes got watery. My hands moved toward my face when my friend stopped me.. \"what are you crazy! you can't rub your eyes in this place..\" That's the feeling you get at Tacos Mexico. So yeah, this place would be an average tasty taqueria... If I were blind and deaf. If I couldn't see the homeless crackhead staring at me from outside (closely) as I was eating my meal. Or if I didn't have to acknowledge the three hobos hitting me up for change as I walked out. Or if there wasn't a flattened, month old pigeon (??) carcass on the drive-through pavement. Or if I could ignore the \"pregnant\" lady who needed money to buy food for her family but refused when I offered to just let me just buy food for her right then and there. Or if I couldn't see the security-barred windows and double doors I had to penetrate. Or... well you get the point. There were only two highlights. The homeless black artist who drew a fairly decent picture of two of my friends as they ate their meal (he ended up being a real cool guy) that and the orange-ish hot salsa which was seriously good and hot. Again, the food is actually alright, but again (and again and again), the whole experience was bad. It did make for a GREAT memory, however, for all the wrong reasons. When we got back into our car, secured the children, and shut the doors. It was a one of those moments you belt out a sigh of relief and share a good long laugh. TACOS MEXICO!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the places my husband and I love coming to on my lunch hour. Great tasting food and the servings are always generous."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious tacos!! Being native from Mexico, I am extremely selective with Mexican Restaurants and won't eat at most. But this one happened to be down the street and I decided to check it out. It truly felt like I was back home. Be careful with the salsa they put on the tacos! On a scale from 1-10 it was an 11 in the level of spicy. If you can't handle spicy I would recommend to ask for no salsa or ask for it on the side. The green one tends to be more spicy than the red one. The only reason I don't give it a 5star was the restrooms weren't very well maintained. Other than that I'd recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Simply put....the best tacos in Calgary!  The beans are also amazingly seasoned.  Lunch special is great 4 tacos for $10."}
{"text":"the absolute worse service i have ever received in a food establishment. the woman taking our order left halfway through to do something else and then came back 10 minutes later to resume taking our order, missing about half of what we wanted when she reviewed it in the end.  the wait for the food was 30-45 minutes even though she told us it would be about 10 minutes.  when we got our food, 2 of our plates were missing.  food wasn't even all that great.  everything was cold."}
{"text":"So good so delicious the Carne asada tacos delicious carne asada burritos huge . The only thing I was disappointed in..  Was that you have to pay extra for a refill .  Salsa needs to be more spicy.  The place is clean."}
{"text":"I came here and asked for a chicken soft taco and a bean burrito. I took a bite of what I assumed would be a bean burrito and it was steak. Red meat makes me physically ill. I would love to eat it every day but unfortunately I can't do it. For someone to ask for a bean burrito and you give them a steak one is not ok."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a good place for tacos for a while and we are so glad we found this place! Will definitely be coming back, frequently!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely not fancy, but it's the real deal.  They've got buche and menudo and sesos.  I had something normal: the tacos al pastor, which were good.  They seem keen to put on lettuce and tomato and sour cream for us gringos, and you can get it with beans and rice if you can't live without those American extras that you never get in Mexico, but you can get it Mexican style as well (i.e. you order a taco, you get a taco).  I liked this place."}
{"text":"Not happy at all. Customer service needs alot of work. I asked the cashier for a towel to clean the table she wasnt so happy about it, i have no idea why Super dirty place. Food is horrible I've been to other tacos mexico in los angeles and i have never had any complaint. I wont be returning."}
{"text":"The food left a lot to be desired.  My friend had a carne  asada burrito that was mushy and salty to the point of being inedible.  I had a chorizo and egg burrito that was mediocre -- too greasey with little fluff to the eggs.  The red and green salsas were OK but not spectacular.  Service was acceptable but not great.  My friends asked about a California burrito, and the cashier scoffed.  I get that it not a Mexican standard, but there's no need to be judgmental about it.    Long story short, I live in San Diego and came here on a work trip, and this Mexican food just doesn't compare to home."}
{"text":"AMAZINGGG!!!!!! after driving around town, this was the only place open on Christmas Eve and I decided to check this place out. We were in a hurry to tame our appetite and this place definitely satisfied our cravings. I ordered the enchiladas, an horchata, and a Jamaica and the flavors were wonderful unlike the watered down places like robertos or pepes. Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I ordered Carne Asada Tacos. Instead I got Carne Asada FAT!!! Tacos. You can't tell me the cook doesn't know he's adding all that fat to the food. They are cheating the customer's by doing this and the taste of large chunks of fat is quite nasty. And the meat that he did add was dry and tasteless. Now I decided to watch him prepare a burrito and I seen him using his one hand that had a glove on it and his ungloved stub( he only has 1 hand) to touch the burritos and tacos.  My friend got sick from food poisoning by eating at this place. I went another time with this same friend and as we walked inside, he became sick again and my ears clogged up. He didn't order any food and I purchased a drink. We will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Do not go to this restaurant if you want authentic Mexican food. I had a chicken and fish taco. The fish is the frozen breaded fish that comes in a box. No bueno at all! I was expecting more from this restaurant but they disappointed me. If you want good Mexican food go to Tacos el Gordo which is down the street from this location. We ate there and the tacos were delicious."}
{"text":"Not a good restaurant by any stretch of the imagination. The food lacked in so many ways. It was greasy and needs better seasoning. My quesadilla literally left a puddle of oil across the entire plate. The restaurant is dirty, crowded and my seat wobbled the whole time. I'll never go again. Me and the crowd I was with, sampled lots of different things and everything was disappointing."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos, fast and easy, and service was super nice. Wednesday's are the best - $.80 can't be beat!"}
{"text":"I'm from San Diego and this place is just a good example of some standard yummy taco shop food.  Had the nachos....fresh meat, nice and hot, spicy cheese all topped with beans  sour cream and fresh made guac.  Under $10 with a large drink can't be beat....keep up the good food guys !"}
{"text":"They have really nice mexican food. Any body that likes mexican dishes this is a really good place to go. Their service is really nice and I think they are real Mexicans to."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal for Tacos. The restaurant is a bit gritty, but I find most authentic taco places are. I randomly found this place on Mexican Independence day - let me say this place was a bumpin' party. Line was out the door, but pulled up first in line at the drive through and received prompt service."}
{"text":"Suck the owner or manager is very disrespectful and when he cheats you out of tacos he says because it your fault"}
{"text":"Honestly I really wanted to like this place. I think the retro building looks great from outside. Inside is another story. The both times I've been here everything feels dirty and greasy, which makes me wonder how clean their food prep area is. On top of that, the people always seem annoyed behind the counter. It's a bit of a hostile environment. They also have never really gotten my order right and really don't seem to care too much about it.   The food in actuality, honestly, isn't that bad, but not worth putting up with all the other stuff. I've seen other people walk out since they weren't getting the time of day there....  I think this place with a new, better management could be a success. Especially since this place is 24hrs, which is a big plus for me."}
{"text":"I've only tried the bean burritos and they are delicious and HUGE! Half will fill you up! Open 24 hour and polite staff."}
{"text":"Not bad for a 24 hour joint, fast service but the food was only worth 2 stars at best... Definitely will NOT be coming back...!!! Dirty tables & floors...!"}
{"text":"Tried Taco Asada (great!), Taco Carnitas (delicious!), Taco Cabeza (okay), Taco Lengua (amazing!), and Carnitas Britto (wow!).  They are working so hard on New Year's Eve. I'm so glad I stopped by this place to try their food. Definitely will be back since they have $0.70 tacos special on Wednesday :)"}
{"text":"this is the worst place to eat!!!!!!!!!! do not come here unless you want hair in your food. the food is disgusting and expensive. i came with 10 people and 5 out of the 10 had hair in the food. nobody was refunded or was given more food. the staff are dumb and have no idea how to run a business."}
{"text":"The food is terrible! The people are rude and don't care about the customer service. I order egg chorizo burrito and menudo. The burrito came with rice beans chorizo but no egg. Just the grease and parts of the chorizo. The menudo had no hominy and it had lots of fat from the pigs feet. No flavor. Will never stop here again, and go to the Denny's next door."}
{"text":"Just stopped in to check out the new restaurant. It's just off Memorial Drive and 36 Street SE. Nicely decorated, clean little place! Great Tacos! Come out and support this Tacos Mexico!"}
{"text":"Usually come here when I'm in Vegas for food .. was passing by and decided to pass since I always rave about their food and their menudo.. well not today I got a plate the juice was kits weird and tasted weird  and the meat looked like it was was over cooked.. Literally made me feel like throwing up . Just left the pale and never again eating their"}
{"text":"Tacos are good. Service is good. Bathrooms are disgusting. Eating area needs cleanup."}
{"text":"I've eaten here about ten times.  It was right up the street from where I used to live and very inexpensive for a taco joint.  Its open 24 hours but the parking is horrible (if someone is the drive-up, you can't get out until they leave).    The food is very good and the choices are many; servings are quite generous.  They only take cash, so be prepared for this when you come (there is an ATM in the restaurant).  It has indoor and outdoor seating but it's right next to Sahara so you don't get much to look at sitting outside.  Like others have commented, its your typical authentic mexican food, nothing more or less.  If you're nearby, it is what I'd recommend."}
{"text":"California favorite, the carne asada is very flavorful."}
{"text":"Amazing green salsa! Best salsa I've ever had. Def would recommend if you're looking for any type of tacos or carne Asada fries"}
{"text":"I love stopping at this place for some late night grub. It's always open and it's pretty cheap.  Just drive up to the window and order there. There is no microphone. And just because it is a drive thru, be warned: the drive thru is pretty slow because they cook-to-order. And the tacos are pretty tiny. But they sure do fulfill my taco cravings."}
{"text":"Best chimichanga ever n street tacos yum... Staff really friendly... They even have a drive thru. Food comes out fast too."}
{"text":"We came here by accident last night when we couldn't find tacos el gordo. I have never heard of this place nor do I live around this area but damn those were good quesadillas! And the staff was super friendly and chill at 4am! They do charge a dollar for credit card transaction which I didn't realize until today but oh wells can't beat friendly customer service!"}
{"text":"The place to come when in Vegas, affordable good food. This is my 6th time here from Los Angeles."}
{"text":"I have eaten her for lunch at 4 am every morning. ( I love Mexican food) they where good then I orderd a taco salad with chicken and it was undercooked. Got sick the next day. I gave it another chance I found some brillo pad shavings in my enchilada. So I had enought went to robertos. If you just like burritos and tacos it's perfect, if u want something more go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I always come here on taco Wednesdays. Its so great that its late night for people like me who have a messed up schedule. Sometimes we work graveyard and its easy to just pick up a couple of tacos on the way home. love it. I never spend more than $10 dollars here at a time. convenient and easy."}
{"text":"Wonderful place!! The food is authentic, the staff is polite and friendly, and the prices are reasonable for the authenticity and quality that you get, no complaints at all."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price.  I ordered three carne asada tacos that came with sides of beans and rice with a medium drink.  My grand total came out to $5.95. I've spend $2-3 more for the same meal at Filiberto's across the street.  The beans and rice were quality.  I've stated before in a review for another restaurant that the quality of the beans and rice can make all the difference.  Many places are generally the same when it comes to the main event of the meal but so many places serve lackluster beans and rice.  Tacos Mexico does not.  Everything about the meal is quality.  The salsa is legit.  Very hot.  So much so that they have a sign warning people.  It's not too hot for seasoned salsa veterans but for the average, um, white person it might pack a wee bit of a wallop.  It must be authentic style salsa.  I've noticed that some places serve salsa that has a very earthy or natural taste (maybe even bitter).  I'm not sure if that's the best way to describe it but it's almost as if hot peppers were blended or pureed with nothing added.  Bottom line, this stuff is hot and fantastic."}
{"text":"I've been a taco Mexico customer for 3 1/2 years and the tropicana location was my favorite, so when I saw this location on charleston I was excited..... Till I walked inn was not greeted and felt humiliated when the cashier tried to explain to me about drinks.. We all know what Jamaica is of coarse and she was rude, management was just the same when I tried to ask about how come there Asada taco almost tried to kill me when I choke on the hard meat, when I tried to talk to a manager they only spoke in Spanish and did not look at me directly poor customer service food tasted like they just recoiled it and didn't actually make it, place is falling apart and not clean and the manager in black who spoke Spanish to her cashier told her not to give me her name because I have no need to have her name and then tell her to tell me her name is Maria...... I am Hispanic and not rude I was calm about very thing but the  staff and management were completely unprofessional and I refuse to ever go back or recommend my friends and family I refuse to let anyone eat at this establishment that does not know how to properly cook good Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Not sure what's not to love about Tacos Mexico. Gotta be the best Taco shop in LV. Lengua, tripa, al pastor, carnitas. Habanero salsa and see you later. It's without a doubt the spot."}
{"text":"I almost threw up after eating the burrito.  the carne was so bland.  as if they put left over meat in my burrito.  The torta was ok, but too wet.  I thought it would be good.  But it was horrible haha."}
{"text":"The only reason it does not get 4 stars is because of the plating and silverware, the plastic knifes are very thin and hard to cut through your food, and the plates are easy to fall apart or tare through. Other than that the food is very delicious! I had the Gordita plate with asada meat and it tasted great. The only down side was the side to it were chips, and that didn't go well with it. My girlfriend had the Sopes plate with Asada meat and she loved the Sopes and said the beans were also great!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican food for good prices. Conveniently open 24hrs to cover those late cravings. Parking kinda sucks but it's never busy so chances is that you will always find a place to park. Their Quesadillas are delicious even if a little greasy. Wish there were more locations..."}
{"text":"Employees are friendly but waiting is. To much. 2 persons to handle lot of customer  call for the owners"}
{"text":"The staff was super rude. They gave attitude. Would never eat here again. We asked to speak with the manager and they said he want there but he was."}
{"text":"A little greasy for my liking.  And on the pricey side compared to similiar buys in Phoenix. But as far as late night grub (3:30 a.m.) it was decent.  The staff was great, even though I couldn't understand a word they said (a mixture of the alcohol in my system, and the Spanglish that was spoken) and the salsa bar was great.  Couple of sauces in there blow my mind with how fresh and tasty they were.  I'm glad I have an iron stomach. This was one of those \"I might have made a bad decision\" nights, but thankfully wasn't the case."}
{"text":"TACOS! There are only two things that make me stop when I'm driving. Christmassy lights flashing on my rear view mirror and taco places. Tacos de Mexico is open 24 hours and close to home, this is like the emergency place for me to go when I'm starving and in need of grease and carbs fast! The food is sooooo good but a little greasy, this is like the Mexican version of heart attack grill on freemont  and that's why I only eat here once in a while. The restaurant doesn't look good from the outside and the inside looks just as good as the outside, but what you see is not what you get, you're here for the tacos and this place is all about your taste buds and nothing more. The taqueros here are very friendly and will answer any question you have about the food, but I wouldn't ask what lengua, cabeza or tripas are, I would just say I'll have three or four of those and point. You'll be glad you tried it whatever it is that you try since everything is good here.                                                                                 ......See you at the taco line."}
{"text":"Peace,  Realest Mexican Food in Las Vegas, period.  You pull in and the place has \"sketch\" written all over it.  No, really, someone carved out the word \"sketch\" on the side of the building.  But anyway, when you walk in you are greeted by a PacMan and Galaga Arcade game (which is awesome).  Then you are greeted in Spanish by the nice lady taking your order who always recommends you go with \"El Burrito.\"  Do it.  Best Burrito I've had outside of southern California or Mexico.  Two bad-ass 2 pound burritos and a drink: 11 bucks!  Add a quarter for a game of PacMan and for $11.25 total you get a monster deal."}
{"text":"Drove thru on recommendation from a worker at our hotel.....this place was exactly as described. We got 3 street tacos each - carnitas and asada, with everything, they were great. We also got a special chicken quesadilla with lots of pepoers and onion that was fabulous ( like fajitas in a quesadilla, lots of jack cheese )  We both said we would be back next time were in Vegas. Close to strip, easy in and out, polite staff and super affordable!!"}
{"text":"Best Tacos De Carne Asada I've had. The meat is so tender and easy to chew and chopped just the right size."}
{"text":"I really hope Tacos Mexico makes it out here in Phoenix. Many L.A. restaurants that have came out to PHX didn't make it. PHX residents have a different flavor. Most PHX folk when they go out to L.a. don't even like King Taco. So Cali folk let's back up this place. Tacos Mexico isn't the best in L.A. but its one of the best for PHX."}
{"text":"A great new addition to the area. I went there last Tuesday for lunch for the second time  and had a selection of street tacos. The food is tasty and the price can't be beat Tuesday half price tacos. Very fast service and the restaurant service areas were spotless."}
{"text":"Cheap, good tacos. Solid."}
{"text":"I am not gonig to say that this is the wold's best mexican--it's not. but for a 24 hr spot, it's totally cool with me!"}
{"text":"Ive been to maybe like more than 1000 taco shop in my life but this one was the worst one I've ever been the customer service I asked for change she reacted like I DONT HAVE IT you guys should close the shop !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here a couple of weeks ago and I got to say the food is good but not as good as robertos and the Don Mexican restaurant on Sahara but I enjoyed my meal the only negative is the price it is very pricey here so expect to pay more for a burrito and some tacos or fries but I enjoy this place and is part of my top 4 favorite Mexican restaurants to eat at just wish the Carne asada burrito wasn't as greasy as it was the last time I ate it but it was still good also the customer service is okay at best I have seen worse but overall this is another one of my go to Mexican restaurants to eat at when I'm in the mood to grab something to eat and I don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"Came here with high expectations when I heard about the celebrities raving about it.  The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because they accommodated my daughter's special request for a breakfast burrito.  They gave my wife water when she ordered lemonade. The meat was skimpy,  the nachos had melted processed cheese on them. It was a big disappointment."}
{"text":"It's not much to look at, but this tiny 24-hour spot has some good burritos and some of the most flavorful salsa in town! The lot is tiny and it's a tight fit squeezing into the drive-thru. Prices are low and menu is simple: pick your meat and choose from tacos, burrito, or nachos. Drinks and asada fries round out your options. My go-to is the lengua burrito, add cheese, it comes to $8.  But back to the salsas. They offer a red and a green, and they're both great. Note that these salsas aren't especially spicy, but they have a marvelous depth of flavor that really adds to your food- I went through two cups of each style with just one burrito!"}
{"text":"The tacos were a bit too greasy and were not as good in flavor as the taco stand down the street. The most disappointing part was the wait.  All I ordered was tacos but I waited so long I wanted to turn off my a car or leave."}
{"text":"I'd give it 3.5 stars. Good food for cheap, real cheap! Just bring your pepto.  So we went here 4 days ago just as we arrived in Vegas.   I ordered the 3 tacos plate (comes with rice and beans and a soda for under $5!!). My gf ordered the sopes, and our friend got the taquitos.  Everyone was pretty satisfied with what they got, the food was super filling. I'd recommend the carne asada tacos over the chicken.   They also have a good salsa station where you can grab some pickled carrots, jalapenos, radishes, fresh cut lemons, along with 4 different salsas. We also ordered a side of their guacamole, which wasn't anything special, but I'd still order it again.   I have to say though, the reason I'm not giving them 4 stars is that we all felt kinda crappy after eating here, very sluggish. I know it's mexican food, and I know it was probably greaser than you can taste which was probably the culprit, but nonetheless the feeling was mutual between us 3.  I'd still go back!"}
{"text":"Los únicos tacos que me gustan en Las Vegas, el sazón es delicioso y el servicio es excepcional. Recomiendo ampliamente este lugar."}
{"text":"Went here for a late dinner with the bfriend and his little nephew at 10pm (this place is open 24/7). We ordered 3 tacos al pastor, 1 quesodilla al pastor, 1 carne asade fries and 1 med horchata drink (free refill). The total came out to be $17ish.  The tacos were slightly warm when it came out. But shouldn't it be hot? I didn't think my order was that long for the food to go warm/cold. The pastor (marinated steak) meat in the tacos was soft , mushy-like and shreddy (which i didnt like--i think the meat is probably old because if meat is marinated for a long time, the acid from the marination breaks down the connective tissue of the meat causing it to be mushy/shreddy). The carne asade fries had skinny fries with melted cheddar cheese, guacomole, onions, a little sour cream, and carne asade meat. It also came out slightly warm and since the cook was a little heavy on the cheese, I felt like i was eating cheese-fries instead of carne asade fries. My horchata tasted like its been watered down-- it was slightly sweet, but there wasn't a strong cinnamon taste in the drink.      My overall experience here wasn't memorable. I wouldn't come back. I think I would be more satisfied eating a Chalupa from Taco Bell!!!"}
{"text":"Not recommended! The restaurant was dirty, dirty tables,  dirty floors, panhandlers right outside the door.  Homeless sitting on the tables with really bad foul odor."}
{"text":"I'm from California and have ALWAYS wanted there to be a Tacos Mexico in Arizona. & there's finally one in Phoenix! Finally came today on a Tuesday!  and it's like a little piece of home #TacoTuesday"}
{"text":"Only have corn tortillas. I ordered 1 carnitas taco it was dry but not bad with a lot of lime. Then 1 carne asada taco it was delicious. Didn't get any chewy pieces. Then got 1 al pastor taco, it was the absolute most DISGUSTING taco I've ever eaten. As soon I took the first bite I instantly spit it out, then I tried a second bite because I really love al pastor but NOPE it was just really bad!!  their salsa's aight, no spice at all."}
{"text":"I was in this restaurant Las week And Was delicious..also The place is very clean..the staff very nice...they have an excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Their al pastor is fantastic! If you love corn tortillas go for the al pastor tacos. Say yes to onions and cilantro on top. Then put the red sauce (self serve) over it. (Yes there's a formula). If you are feeling flour tortilla go for the al pastor burrito (it comes with beans and rice, but I took a cue from my friend Vanessa and just get it with meat... onions cilantro red sauce again). I prefer the corn tortilla tacos. Yummy.  Open 24 hrs-- Sahara and Valley View. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Tacos are really good. Best I ever had. Inexpensive. Sketchy neighborhood but just be watchful. Place is a little run down with bars on the door but I'm not that picky as long as the food is worth it.  Now for the staff.  The cashier lady tonight was so rude. Very unprofessional and unfriendly. She had a sour face, would not wait for us to finish our orders so she kept placing them incorrectly.  She did not only mess up our order but I overheard she messed up another customers order.  When the customer told one of the staff there, she went to tell the cook and she laughed about it and the cook had an angry face like it was a bother. It was just tacos, why is it such a bother to place them on different plates?!  Fear asking for a refill:  So this place only has the soda machine  where you have to ask the cashier for a refill.  This is a pretty busy place so I timed it to where the line was short (one lady in front of me). I stood behind this lady for about 15 mins.  The lady was not placing an order but was chit chatting with the cashier about personal things.  The cashier could of easily stopped the convo very quick to see what I needed but instead she kept on ignoring the actual customer behind (I'm gonna assume) friend. I finally got my chance when her friend realized I was waiting. The cashier barely acknowledged me, did not stop chit chatting with her friend, took my cup without looking at me but correctly assumed what refill I wanted (lucky guess?). I've been here before and I know they charge 50 cents for refill but I guess the cashier didn't care cuz she just placed my drink on the counter and continued to ignore me. I quickly ran off and my friend could not believe how long that took.  When we left the cashier had a stupid smile on her face directed at us. I just ignored her and walked out without saying anything with my friend behind me. Later, my friend told me the cashier and another girl that was cleaning the floor were laughing when we walked out and assume it was at us for some reason.  This would get 5 stars if the staff was friendlier, it's a shame because the food makes it 5 stars.  It's not a high end restaurant by any means but a smile and politeness wins over customers who would write positive reviews to bring in more business. I hope the owner sees this review, not only losing customers but giving away free refills."}
{"text":"Delicious vegetarian burritos. And they are massive and the veggies are so fresh!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place since the mid 90's probably around the time that some of these other reviewers were in diapers so I know what I'm talking about with this place.  We once challenged our good friend to eat 10 brain tacos and he took the challenge.  My other friend eats the lengua and that's the taco that tastes you back my friend,   I eat the bean and rice burrito and can say that it's good,  the salsa bar is nice with the little cups and I do recommend the red sauce.  The neighborhood is typical east side so nothing to worry about, years back there was a guy that just sat in the booth and sold bootleg Spanish cassette tapes of Mexican corridas music   You can her horchata and it's a great place because it's 24 hours"}
{"text":"This place says it's open 24 hrs and we came to get some late night food around 1:30 am just to find out that they ran out of meat. We only got 3 tacos for 2 people since they didn't have anymore food. That is very unprofessional for a place that's open 24 hrs. While we were waiting we sat down at the little booth and all the tables were dirty. This establishment is not the place to eat, I never write reviews but this place was that bad that I had to write a review. If you're looking for a place to eat, avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"80¢ tacos on Wednesday are a pretty good deal and the Torta aint half bad. The building is super old and looks like I could sneeze it over, but who gives a crap how right? As long as the foods good."}
{"text":"Eh.. just eh.. they changed their menu so now they barley have anything ive become to love over tome at taco Mexico .. too bad"}
{"text":"The to hear is decent but it really depends who was working at the time. It seems like some of the cooks  are better at cutting the fat out of the meat and sometimes you end up with really fatty meat but some people may like that."}
{"text":"This place is the best. I can't go to Vegas with out stopping here and grabbing a Carne asada burrito.  The best part is that they're open 24 hours with a drive thru."}
{"text":"After walking down to the Stratosphere early one morning, just to check the area out, I spotted Tacos Mexico lucking peacefully there on the opposite side of the street as I was trying to walk in the shade. Given I had just flown in, my body was still not on local time and it was way past lunch time for me though it was only 10:00.   While walking, I stopped and asked a couple of local people what they thought of the Mexican place across the street and had they eaten there?  They said the food was \"authentic\" Mexican and the best meals were to be had earlier in the day.. so I thought perfect - let's give it try.    Yeah, I read some other reviews and in walking up, the place is surrounded by smash bars on the windows and doors and even on the interior doors so go figure!  Is it design, is it decor, or is it protection or all the above?   Make no mistake, you know what end of the strip you are on and yeah, it's definitely not in the ultra-touristy end of the strip but it is not far from the Stratosphere and it's easy to get to by bus, car or on foot if you are very adventurous and don't mind a good hike!    Is the place going to give some people pause either from the outside or when they walk in sure.. but sometimes you need to trust your gut and your nose.   I walked in and was promptly greeted by the young lady at the front cashier.  I scanned the menu and ordered a chicken burrito and large soda as I was dying from thirst from the early morning Vegas heat - did I mention I walked from the other end of the strip to here?   The burrito was wonderful!   It was stuffed with chicken, beans and no cheese!  Nor was it stuffed with rice, rice, rice like many places.. I felt it was just the right combo and the flavors were dead on. There were no sides w/ the burrito but I really didn't need any.  It was all I could do to finish the single burrito and hit the trail back.   While seated, there were quite a few locals who looked like they were regulars really enjoying their meals.  If you are up to the hike to this end of the stip or drive or bus or cab, and are craving authentic Mexican, then give these guys a try.   For the price no where near what you normally see on the other end of the strip, you will not likely be disappointed and will be rewarded with something to remember!."}
{"text":"Carne Asada and Tacos al Pastor, Check.  Blasting Tejano Music at 4:30am, Check.  Salsa Roja, with Pickled Carrots and Onions, Check.  Homeless Crackheads Outside, Check .  If your visiting Vegas and staying in Downtown, this is the best place to stop on the way home from a night of partying on the strip. And yes, they even have a drive-thru ;-) Spoken from a Vegas cabbie, this is the best place to get tacos if your in this part of town, I eat here probably 2-3 times a week. can't beat $1.25 per taco, the service is fast, and I only found 2 pieces of gristle in my tacos. Not too shabby."}
{"text":"My first time in Vegas and I saw this place checking things out online prior to my trip. I knew I wanted to go here because it's walking distance from the Stratosphere hotel-casino-tower where I was staying.....  I came here six or seven times. I lost count. Day, night whenever. it's open 24-hours and, needless to say, but I'll say it: I'm a fan! A huge fan !!! The food was tasty and good. Burritos, Sopas, Tacos, Cortinas even with Lengua, which I never had until that time, it was all delicious. So good it had me speaking Spanish! The place looks like a converted KFC and has the look of a neighborhood hang out spot for locals. Don't let this deter you, as the surrounding area can be *sketchy*....but everything I had, even the tamarind drink was fantastic.   Big Fan!"}
{"text":"Crackin! low down, grimey and straight to the point. I love it. It's clean enough for me to feel comfortable and the tacos are great. These tacos would be what I call traditional to me growing up in cali. Simple, good meat and cheap.   the parking lot is a little tough to navigate when they are busy but we'll worth the hassle. I always feel like I hit the lotto when there is no line to order but never takes more than 5 min and the food comes out quickly.   If I had to pick a negative it's that the horchata always tastes a little watered down but that never stops me."}
{"text":"Solid taqueria. Very small little place with a confusing little parking lot. It was one-way designed but when exiting I couldn't tell if the exit side was a drive thru or if people just parked there and blocked the exit.. Lol ANYWAY let's rate the food shall we? Hahah  Came inside and you can tell the place is really old. Not really kept up together like others.. Which kinda made me skeptical about the food. But since I came with some friends and was pretty hungry we gave it a shot. The front where you order is a super narrow walkway and the menu is along the wall. Prices are really cheap!! Instead of getting tacos, I opted for some sopes since I miss my boyfriend's mom's sopes haha. I got them Al Pastor and it cost $5.65 which isn't bad at all for a loaded plate! This came with 2 filled sopes, rice, beans and some chips! I was so freaking full. It was made a bit differently than I'm used to but still really good! Very impressed"}
{"text":"Delicious. Tried tongue for the first time. Wish the service was faster. Happy with the food."}
{"text":"Closest thing to Taco Truck style.. I love the small tortillas and little scoop of meat, where it takes like 2 bites and off to the next one. I can eat these like potato chips!  Carne Asada: has got that authentic mexican beef marinated flavor, undoubtely savory in every way but ilve had much better!  Carnitas: quite impressive (I may just really like pork), again authentic mexican pork cooking..   I can definitely vouch for this place and its cheap! I think wednesdays they have 50 cents taco special too."}
{"text":"By far the worst establishment I have ever been in to eat tscos.  The meat was overcooked.  The place dirty and the customer service a joke.  Would not recommend this place.  Recommend the one on sahara.  Unfortunately the on trop has closed.  Stay away from this location."}
{"text":"Best Chorizo, egg, rice and cheese burrito in Vegas.  Great value and terrific fresh food made to order.  It's open 24/7.  What more could you want or need to soak up all that excess alcohol after a night in Sin City."}
{"text":"Tacos are good. Best deal for Taco Tuesday. Only complaint is their Call Ahead service. They either forget they have you on hold or they don't hang up their phone and can't get through to them. Very problematic for those who don't have long lunch breaks during a work week. Hope the fix it.   Espero vean este comentario y mejoren su servicio por teléfono. Es incómodo e inconveniente esperar por 5 minutos tratando de hacer un pedido para llevar, y al final darse cuenta que me han olvidado que estoy esperando en el teléfono. Y al intentar de llamar de regreso, las llamadas no entran. Sucede frecuente."}
{"text":"Reading about all these tacos my friends are eating reminded me of my own well kept secret taco joint!  I'm so addicted to this place that it's not even funny. The four stars is because they don't speak English and they can be pretty abrupt and rude most days. OTHER THAN THAT, these are the best, most authentic tacos I've ever eaten. They make me so happy!  Okay, to be very fair, I only get the carne asada tacos with onions, cilantro and green sauce. Mmmmmmm...green sauce. They are small, but pack a mighty Mexican punch! The meat is always tender, never chewy and they always, always use two corn tortillas so you have something to hold your filling in. Those one corn taco places ensure you'll end up with food in your lap every single time! Not here!  I also love their beans and rice. The generous serving can be shared by two!   I can get out of there with three tacos, beans and rice and a drink for about $5. Not bad, not bad.   These are best eaten drunk or hungover. What? It's true! But, I happen to think all Mexican food is best that way. Then sober, next. Then every day. But you get the picture.  This building will scare you, it's doesn't have a working speaker at the menu board so keep driving to the window. Also, CASH ONLY.   If you have a few dollars in cash to spare, get over here fast! For location info: it's close to the Stratosphere, next to the Burger King.   Just drive up and say 'Tacos, por favor' to eat the best you'll ever have!"}
{"text":"When you want great Mexican food, you gotta look for a  hole-in-the-wall restaurant to get it and this place is it. I love to order a  variety of their tacos because they are all so good. This place reminds me of little Mexican taco restaurants back home in LA. Yes the interior is lacking but it makes up for it in authenticity and tastiness."}
{"text":"Went here with my sister for a quick bite. We had the nachos, which were incredible, home made salsa! The chicken enchiladas for our mains were both delicious! Definetly will go back, this place will get more and more popular, it's still a secret. So get in there asap"}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill. The last time I went they had really good al pastor tacos with pineapple. My last visit I got 2 carne asada tacos, and I got al pastor nachos, but I don't think the meat they gave me was pastor. If it was, it has to be some of the worst pastor I have ever had. This meat was dry and tasted old. It had no flavor. The tacos were pretty good, which is why the 2 stars. I probably won't be back though.  Yelp 2015 Review #21"}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant I've ever been to! Friendly service, fair prices and delicious food. Try the refried beans with feta - you won't regret it. I got another order to take home it was so good! Also, if they try to talk you into their cake (Pastel 3 Leches)...just do it.  Trust me! Oh and the  Combinacion Mexicana... amazing! I had no idea I'd like the pickles...almost asked for it without, but decided to try them and was glad I did."}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with Tacos Mexico. I know I could have way better tacos elsewhere but it's like a bad relationship, I keep on going back because I need tacos in my life.   Prices have gone up, gone are the days when you could order a taco for $1.19, now a mediocre taco will cost you $1.69.   This Tacos Mexico is located in a shady downtown neighborhood. I once had a bum stare at me while eating, it made for a very uncomfortable situation. The service here is just okay. It's a hit and miss. Today's cashier was extremely rude, she slammed the drive thru window as soon as the bag touched my hand, she was not friendly, she seemed miserable. On the plus, they finally got an English speaking cashier, thick accent, but that's a step towards the right direction. They only used to have non-english speaking cashiers.   The food is okay, tacos are mediocre like I mentioned before. I've never ordered anything else here before. They do have a taco special, three tacos with beans/rice, and chips for $5 and some change. It's worth ordering if you're paying with cash, if you're paying with a debit/credit card then you'll be charged an additional dollar. The beans are the best here, they top them off with cheese, the meat is too dry and the rice has no flavor.    Drive thru needs to improve. Wait time is about 20 minutes and they have no prices listed on their drive through menu. They have no voice box and you have to order at the drive thru window. For the price I could definitely go somewhere else with far better service and food but they're just so close to work that I keep running back to them, uugh."}
{"text":"Had the Carne asada tacos. The tortilla was dry, but the meat was ok. The place wasn't clean and there was flies inside. For me I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"After a day of sightseeing around the Strip, we wanted to eat something that was not a chain.  So when we spotted Tacos Mexico we immediately pulled into the lot.  There is nothing fancy about this place, but the food... oh dear lord the food.  Everything was delicious and spicy and super authentic.  Nothing was overpriced and the service was quick and friendly.  The only thing we found to be a tad bit lacking was the lack of sides with some of the meals, particularly the burrito and the torta.  But the flavors were outstanding and exactly what you should expect from a Mexican eatery.  Definitely hit this place up the next time you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful 24 hour taqueria. It's a fabulous dingy dive with absolutely incredible Mexican 'fast food' that's delightfully inexpensive. Right by the strip and hotels, too!  We loved everything we had, especially the carne asada and al pastor tacos (99 cents!) which were deeply flavored and exceptionally tender. The \"Papas con Carne\" (fries with cheese & meat) were outstanding. For $6.99 you'll get more than two people can eat, that's for sure!   I was very impressed with their salsas, too... never had such a unique, delicious variety available in a salsa bar.  Excellent late night food at very low prices, served quickly & piping hot. Now THIS is what I call \"fast food\"."}
{"text":"Just bad. Tortillas were dry. Beef was chewy and the chicken was dry. Just moved to the area and wanted to give them a chance.  Tried a variety of the tacos, nachos and a gordita.  The only thing memorable was the gordita and that was barely. Drive an extra 5 mins down Charleston and hit up los tacos or tacos tijuana instead. WAY better. Also the place needs a nice mopping. They also charge a buck to use card and its not cheap. I won't be back."}
{"text":"4 stars for 70 cent tacos all day Wednesday ... would give it 5 if that was the price all the time.  Even tho the promised pastor hasn't actually been available the 2x I've visited ... the carnitas is good enough. Buche also an option but I'm not a huge fan of it.   4.56 after tax for 4 tacos and a pretty good small horchata. Keep in mind this good review is for 2 P.M. food. I would guess the 2 A.M. food is a totally different story."}
{"text":"Omgosh, I'm getting hungry just thinking about them! Fast and hot. Glad their close by lol!"}
{"text":"I go to the one by the stratosphere. It's about $5 for a big burrito. I usually get two meals out of one burrito, which is great. I get the carnitas and my boyfriend gets the carne asada, combined with the self-serve salsas (the verde & orange habanero rock) it's a filling cheap meal. The burritos are stuffed with rice, beans, tons of meat and fresh cilantro and onion. The tacos are cheap and tasty, stuffed with meat and raw onion and cilantro. Cash only, but good frugal eats!"}
{"text":"Leaving the club...looking for late night eats...and In-N-Out's closed!  This Chicago kid was ready to commit ritualistic suicide on the spot.  Well, it turned out to be a blessing in disguise, as we came here, and I finally got to try carne asada fries.  This leads me to believe that Tacos Mexico used to be known as Tacos France (seriously though...what a stupid name).  Whatever...even though they weren't on the menu, they sure did serve the fries.  And while my Californian friends remarked that it's made a lot better near them, I had no complaints.  They were cheap, plentiful, and damn tasty."}
{"text":"We ordered carne Saadia nachos, tacos & a churro... simply delicious!!! I'm picky when it comes to Mexican food!  I'll be back"}
{"text":"Ate here for the 1st time today & got the nachos, 2 tacos & a churro & simply delicious.  I'll be back for sure & the customer service is wonderful as well."}
{"text":"Not quite as good as I remember it used to be.    Maybe an order of 20 plus tacos wasn't the best idea, or maybe the tacos were that much better when I was here a few years back.  My pals and I needed heavy sustenance so we ordered a ton of tacos broken down as below:  Buche (1/5) - undercooked and a bit slimy.  Just not hitting the mark. Al Pastor (3/5) - overcooked, though still had a decent marinated flavor  Lengua (1/5) - probably the worst tongue I've ever had and I'm a huge fan of lengua. Carnitas (2/5)- super dry, bland and tasteless. Pollo (4/5) - Best of them all, not overcooked.  Solid choice.  I usually don't bitch when places run out of food, but I was looking forward to some classic carne asada tacos, but they ran out during one of their busiest times.  Maybe the beef would have been better?"}
{"text":"Went here while my sister was getting a tattoo a few blocks down. Pretty ghetto area but delicious tacos. We went with the standard asada tacos and they were the perfect little palm-sized munchies overstuffed with steak, white onion and cilantro"}
{"text":"The beans, and rice where fantastic. The tacos al pastor where horrible to me. The carne asada tacos were great! If you want one of the best carnitas, and Pastor tacos go to Carnitas y Tortas ajogadas de Guadalajara"}
{"text":"This place looks just as terrible on the inside as it does on the outside. It's not the cleanest or the most inviting and honestly, if I wasn't pushed by a coworker to go here on a Wednesday, I probably never would have given it a chance.   However, you cannot beat 70 cent tacos. I ordered the tacos al pastor and they were wonderful. The meat was fresh and the fresh onions/cilantro that were placed on top of the taco were a delightful addition to the flavor of the meat.   I also ordered a chicken Tamale. I am a sucker for tamales but I have yet to find a Mexican restaurant that makes them as good as the homemade ones I have bought from street vendors or the families who drop by our office during Christmas time to sell them. This tamale was pretty delicious and definitely one of the best I have had at a restaurant in Vegas. It was moist and flavorful. Grab one!  Give this place a shot if you want cheap eats and aren't turned off by the shady neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This place is great. The food is delicious and good price. It's behind the stratosphere.  La comida muy buena. Lo recomiendo"}
{"text":"On our recent trip to Vegas, our initial flight was delayed, which caused us to miss our connecting flight, sadly this meant instead of having a fun first night in Vegas we didn't get into town till the wee hours and were exhausted and hungry. Enter Tacos Mexico for a quick, cheap, late night meal. The tacos were good, although not amazing, but they hit the spot and were surprisingly affordable for being so close to the strip. Im pretty sure its open 24 hours, and it has a drive through, so we were able to grab some food and get back to our hotel quickly for some much needed rest. While I would probably never choose to come here during regular hours, I would not hesitate to return for a quick, after hours meal."}
{"text":"Been to this place a couple of years ago and it was fine. Went there last night. Had a taco de carne asada that did not look, smell,  or taste like carne asada. My wife and I were both worried we were gonna get sick. That was the last time we will be going there."}
{"text":"Great Cheap Vegas Food- right behind the Stratosphere!! Go eat yummy dinner- soups- Posole- Caldo- Biria- tacos burritos nachos- all food was yummy!!!!!"}
{"text":"With the exception of the ambiance, this is my second favorite Mexican restaurant in town.  The first being LIndo Michoacan and the third being Roberto's. :)  Tacos Mexico is truly authentic Mexican food - you'll find no fried tacos here.  It's like going to a street vendor in Mexico.  Of course you will also find some of the dirty people and/or tables in the dining area so I recommend going through the drive thru, lol.  And p.s. they don't accept credit cards so bring cash!"}
{"text":"Just like it's counterpart in California this place is awesome. Tacos for under a dollar? You can't beat that. And it's open 24 hours. This place always hits the spot!"}
{"text":"was in Las vegas for the labor day weekend, arrived here  really hungry. I was with 2 of my buddies and we all decided  to go with the Nachos. These were probably the best nachos  i've had in a while. Tortilla chips , with beans, Carne asada,  Cheese, Tomato, & Guacamole . These nachos were  enough for the three of us..we were so full after words..will  definitely come here again. Its Cheap and will satisfy your needs.. service is fast..and OPEN 24 Hours!!!"}
{"text":"Really good Carne Asada  tacos and their salsa was good too. Will definately be back!"}
{"text":"Fast and good!   Fresh ingredients, salsa was delicious!  My husband said the flavors took him back to San Jose Del Cabo.  Would be my goto for Mexican food if we lived in Vegas."}
{"text":"If it is real authentic mexican food? I think not, more likely real mexican fastfood. You really cant compare it with Mexican restaurant in Belgium or Holland. More a McDonalds style cheap Mexican rip off. Wel the food it self was not bad, but it was fast food. And the place itself had seen its best years,  Manu years ago. It Needs Some restauration. The prices are cheap, and they are open 24/7."}
{"text":"I always get the carne asada burrito here, it's my favorite."}
{"text":"All the reviews must be from friends or family,  because the food is nasty, not a lot of flavor,  I will never stop here again. If you do not believe buy one and judge for yourself."}
{"text":"Tried this location today and had a Chicken Burrito & while the service was very fast, and the girl taking the order was smiling and very nice, it was \"More filler than Killer\" compared to the one I usually go to by Stratosphere on LV Blvd where they load the Chicken on hard and you get your $5's worth. At this Location it was more beans & rice than chicken. It was good though but I'll be sticking with my neighborhood location."}
{"text":"I've been here once before & dont remember what I had,  BUT what I did have came wt chips & I added some sauce that got it FIRED UP!! Big time!!...I remember THAT!! = FIYAAAA!!!  Today I had them in my sights long range at 3pm'ish riding the day on only an omelet at 10am. I was hungry and ordered the Chicken Burrito and it did not fail....THIS is authentic Mexican so it wasnt full of rice, beans, cheese, sour cream or guacamole.  The burrito at $5 was big and thick = soft ball size, full of moist chicken. It wasnt spicey & I had to add to it once I got it home.   I reccomend this place BIG TIME!!"}
{"text":"I don't care what anybody says about this place. I'm a fan! I love the carne asada taco's! The price is cheap and you get authentic Mexican food. I tried multiple dishes on the menu but have to stick to what I know and the carne asada taco's does it for me. YUM!"}
{"text":"This is a classic Vegas place, it's been around forever.  This was the first authentic Mexican restaurants I'd ever been to since it was close to my high school.  I remember being freaked out by the appearance of it at first, but really it's pretty good.  As the other reviewer noted, you can get all kinds of traditional Mexican meats that Americans generally don't eat, but don't let that worry you.  Get the carne asada like you had planned, you'll still get carne asada.  It's so yummy.  They ain't the cleanest places, but they sure is tasty."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Lots of fatty meat on the carne. And it's like they gave us the shake of the carne. Very small overly chopped pieces. The lady at the register was rude, almost like she didn't want to take out order. Only reason I give it one star is because I have too. I have a carne Assad taco"}
{"text":"Dont have high expectations when you come here. You are paying less for lower quality mexican food. Its still good. The only complain i have is the food is very bland no salt no pepper no spices in the rice either.    Service was Okay..   Decor is awesome."}
{"text":"Not sure how they stay in business and do a huge business. Food is either salted for a survival journey or flavorless. The sauces are hit and miss and they seem to lean towards better servixe to nonenglish speakers. Been there 4 times in 12 years never good. I forget and go back."}
{"text":"They charge an \"unadvertised\" $1 charge for use of Mastercard, Visa, Debit, and any other credit card.  This is against these credit card's policies!  I ordered a carne asada burritos for $5 + tax and it was just plain alright...nothing special.  I ordered around 11pm and there was only two customers in the entire store.  The meat looked and tasted as it had been sitting in a bin for awhile.  THEY DO NOT MAKE IT FRESH...I can tell you that for a FACT!  The good ones always throw the meat on the grill once you order it."}
{"text":"Always find a way to come here when in las vegas.  You know food is authentic when broken english is spoken here.  Tonight it was cabeza taco and chili relleno plate. Sorry I always forget to take pics but here's what i hv left before I gobble the rest up.  This place has been here for many years, I have been coming here always when in town. I made the mistake of trying the orange colored salsa on time, never again, first time my taste buds were gone and the mouth was in fire, guess habanero and I don't get along."}
{"text":"I will never eat here again. Couldn't enjoy any of my food because all the hard stuff in my asada, worse tacos ever!"}
{"text":"Yum! Ever since moving to Las Vegas from Los Angeles I miss King Taco. This place satisfies my authentic taco cravings. I usually go to this place because they accept debit/credit cards. Other places (the one on sahara ave. and the one by stratosphere does not.)  So here's 4 stars for you, Tacos Mexico!"}
{"text":"They have a great Al Pastor Burrito, they are fast. I always get my food to go, the dining area is not kept clean and I avoid their bathrooms. But for some reason I keep coming back."}
{"text":"I really hope their kitchen it's cleaner than their floors and tables, we come here because of starvation as TACOS EL GORDO WAS TOTALLY FULL, so we have no choice but this, will see how their tacos taste"}
{"text":"This is not the place to go for good Mexican food.  For me, it was the first available place to throw something down my throat so I wouldn't rip someone's head off from starvin' like marvin' after a day of walking around in the sun. It is sustenance. It is food. I chewed, I swallowed, but I did not enjoy what I tasted.  I had a chicken taco. The chicken was not grilled, only boiled & had zero flavor/seasoning. The bf & I shared carne asada nachos- we left 75% of it right on the plate- cheese was not melted, carne asada was bland & the chips were stale.   Service was slow & every surface (counter, tables, floor) was grimey. I will not be returning. I don't advise people to eat fast food by any means, but I would have been happier had I just gone to the Burger King next door.  I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt & say we just caught them on a bad day, but we came here last year & it was just as awful.  P.S.-the bf had 3 tacos & said the only good one was the carnitas; Carne asada & al pastor were flavorless & disappointing. 2 out of 3 bad meats--thats a terrible ratio & therefore 1 star."}
{"text":"I love the tortas ahogadas, is a very tradicional dish from my hometown Guadalajara and for the price you can't go wrong, I usually split a second one with the wife cause she loves them as well, also there is so much to chose from and everything tastes so good.  I really recommend this restaurant  Don't forget to try the churros with chocolate syrup and ice cream or the 3 leches cake! They are great !"}
{"text":"I came for the first time with my family a few years ago and the again over the weekend. The food is still amazing! I love the nachos de carne asada that they serve here."}
{"text":"Love going to this little restaurant, it's authentic and the food has good flavours. It reminds me of the restaurants we go to when in Mexico. We have tried other Mexican places around Calgary, but always end up coming back here. The service is friendly and they are willing to accommodate some requests for vegetarian.  Had the Mexican platter and they changed it up to accommodate our vegetarian request."}
{"text":"I had heard great things about Taco Mexico from friends who live in Cali, as my understanding is that they're a local chain that are a favorite for many. I however, was not impressed. Certainly not the worst taco I've ever had, but nothing close to the best, either. They do have a .75¢ Taco Tuesday however, so you can't complain about that!"}
{"text":"I am planning my trip to Las Vegas in March.  One place that comes in mind for good Mexican food just off the \"Strip\" is Tacos Mexico.   It is a very bright cafeteria style restaurant with a menu posted on a huge board that will take you a few minutes to figure what you want.  They have  a wide variety of meats and different ways to serve the tacos or burritos.    I had a huge carne asada burritos that was very tasty.  I think it cost something like $4!  What a bargain for sure!  I also had a large horchata drink.  Well, it was the size of a barrel!  All in all, a very filling meal that i could not finish no matter how hard I tried!  I was full until late the next day!  Be warned, they do serve in large portions so come hungry.  If you decide to take the rest home or back to your hotel, be warned that the food may leak out of your bag and get all over the place.    So, on my future trip to Las Vegas, I will have to catch a cab to this great Mexican restaurant.  I can't wait...of course, there are plenty of places I am looking forward to going to, but like last time, I managed to get here at 3 in the morning after an almost all night party!"}
{"text":"This location was super clean and the the food tasted great!   The staff was friendly and the tacos were bomb, the carne asada was fresh and flavorful. Everything we had was delicious. Plus it's open 24-7...   I'll def be back when I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Another quick lunch led me to this place. I headed straight to the drive-thru and ordered their lunch special: 4 tacos, a drink, and fries for $4.99. They get points for being quick (only waited about 5 minutes) and friendly. Unfortunately, that's about the best thing about this place. I ordered 2 carne asada tacos and 2 al pastor tacos. The tortillas were thick and gummy. The asada was dry and had little flavor. The al pastor was excessively greasy and the fries were forgettable. This might be good drunk food at 4 in the morning, but when you're sober... not so much."}
{"text":"I have eaten here before and normally it's fine. Today I ordered a Lengua Burrito and added cheese for almost a dollar. They forgot to add the cheese but the worst part is they didn't even shred or cut the lengua. I had huge CHUNKS of lengua in my burrito. I've never had anything lengua that wasn't properly chopped. Sorta disgusted by the way it looked and tasted mediocre. Lost a customer"}
{"text":"The food is great here. A little pricey for the tacos but it's worth it. I would give it 5 star if the place was a little bit cleaner. It's a little rundown and the interior is super out dated but I mean taco places are generally like that. The service isn't bad, it could be a little faster but it's nothing intolerable. Definitely my go to taco spot if I'm in the area"}
{"text":"When I'm in Las Vegas and craving some good Mexican food, I go to Tacos Mexico.  My brother who lives in Vegas turned me on to this place, and I just visited them this past Friday and Saturday.  On Friday I ordered the Carne Asada burrito with everything in it, and then on Saturday, the El Pastor burrito.  You definitely get your moneys worth.  The burritos are so big, I had to cut in in half.  I had half for breakfast and half for lunch.  Their salsa is also great.  The drive-thru takes a while, but it's worth it.  My boyfriend ordered the Chorizo breakfast plate, and that was also a good sized portion."}
{"text":"It was nice to find a local taco place open at 3 A.M after a night of fun. Food was O.K a little on the greasy side but prices were good and it fit the bill that night, Aloha"}
{"text":"Greasy and undercooked. Sunday night cook no bueno. I ended up throwing most of it away. Waste of money! USED TO BE one of my favorite places to get food to go. Please close so Roberto's or Tacos el Gordo can buy it out. PLEASE! Very disappointing.."}
{"text":"Long wait, waste of time for COLD, miniature-sized, bland pollo tacos. Bought 3 and was only able to finish 1. Never again."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, the first time it was good. Today i came in with my family and my aunt got menudo there was a hair in the menudo so we took it back to the cashier and she didn't even bother to say anything about it!!!!! Check your food before eating"}
{"text":"It was ok pretty hard to mess up a breakfast burrito. Everything was ok really nothing special but nothing to complain about either.  Saw a lot of people eating breakfast there so gave it a try. Not making a special trip to go there but if driving by and hungry might go back."}
{"text":"I get tacos from here weekly & they're always great. Salsas are always fresh, a little expensive but worth it. Just as good if not better than other popular taco places are und"}
{"text":"Huge fan of Mexican food., love coming here after drinking or a long day at work. They have the small tacos for like 70 cents or something like that. Also have the avocado slices which I love. They usually hook it up if you order a lot of food. I like that it's more authentic then a Taco Bell or Chipotle. Most places in Vegas are just tex-mex."}
{"text":"How do you end an otherwise great evening at Sage with a celebrity followed by goth-o-rama by Morpheus Blak at the Artifice? You tell the driver to swing by Tacos Mexico for a quick bite since it's literally the only option on the path home.  Why the 1 star? Well, last I checked, chicken burritos are supposed to have COOKED chicken in them, not raw and pink fowl...or is it foul? Yes to both I proclaim!  I love playing the \"let's act like a bulimic\" game.  Gracias por nada, Tacos Mexico."}
{"text":"Don't let the big sign and the 70 cent taco sign fool you. You get what you pay for and it'll have its revenge. The tacos were flavorless and topped with some weird cheese sauce. Not too authentic."}
{"text":"We hit this place on the way home from a party...a typical LV party with plenty of booze and not so much as a potato chip to eat. I was starving!  The staff was awesome. Super friendly! The place feels like a \"fast food\" taco shop, but the food was definitely better than that. It is not the best taco place in the city, but on the way home, after a late night it was pretty F'N great!  I would happily head back for another round of tacos made with love at Tacos Mexico!"}
{"text":"I love a sketchy 24-hour taco shop, which is why Tacos Mexico has my heart.   After a mellow night of sipping drinks around Downtown Vegas, my belly called and said, \"put burritos in me\", not one to argue with the body, I did as such. But instead of rehashing the same old spots near DT I was decided to venture down Charleston see what the, \"hood\" had to offer.  Enter Tacos Mexico, and old school spot complete with dated restaurant furnishings, a jukebox, and the savory smell of fried pork and tortillas, nummy numms. I went with the Al pastor burrito, filled with marinated and grilled pork, rice and beans. To be honest I've never had an Al pastor burrito with rice and beans, normally it's just meat, chopped onion and cilantro. This variation of the burrito was still tasty, but the addition of house made salsas was needed for that extra little kick.   The meat was a little under seasoned and I could have done without the rice and beans, but I'm assuming they use these as filler for the burrito. All in all no big complaints and very fast service which is really all you can ask for from an all night fast food joint."}
{"text":"The first time we ate there was so good. we planned next trip especially to eat there. However, the second time the food was gross. It was so bad we never ate there again. It's true, it depends on the chef. I have little to say about this place, I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Have no idea where the bad reviews are coming from but what do people expect on a day called \"Taco Tuesday\" it's called Taco Tuesday for a reason. this place is always pack on that day. Yes the wait can be a lil long sometimes but the food is very good and is worth it. You can't beat $.75 cent tacos. you have to remember the person in front of you probably ordered 20 tacos not including all of the other orders placed before yours. But anywho, the food here is great. been going to taco tuesday for the last 6 weeks and i will continue to go and will update if ever there is an issue."}
{"text":"Never been a huge fan of Tacos Mexico when I lived in Long Beach. Since I haven't tried them in years, figured I stop by for another try.  I had their chili cheese fries, I actually like it a lot. Fries are smothered with nacho cheese and chili. Since this was a not on your diet item, the portion is just fine. It does look like they have added a lot of items on their menu since I last used them. However I still have the same opinion as I did before. Their food is OK, they do not use the best quality of meat. When you decide to eat at a franchise like Tacos Mexico, you are willing to eat at a place that no longer has that love in craft. Unlike a mom and pops dive. It's our decision where we want to eat, and we all know franchises are never the best options."}
{"text":"I came here two years ago and I loved it, apparently. But I went back today and was disappointing... The gordita was kinda sogginess if the tortilla was more crispier then it would get a pass but it wasn't. Okay flavor, but no. The Asada tacos were dry and the el pastor was just not all there. The flavor was off. It just tasted like freaking tomate and salsa. Definitely I will try another location."}
{"text":"Better than the one down Sahara, but this location is horrible. Or at least don't show up at night. My whole night got ruined because I came here. Right now I'm pissed because of the stupid ass ghetto people around this area. They ruin the fucking mood when you walk into a Mexican taco place. They just come in and bother everyone and scream and shout. Shit man... If I ever come back I am getting it to go. Fuck this place and fuck all the other Tacos Mexico I am going somewhere else. Oh yeah for the record the Carne asada was kinda burnt. The lengua was good. The rick was dry but the frijoles were real good."}
{"text":"By the time I found this place I was so sick of looking for a great authentic mexican food in Nevada. I was so SICK OF IT! But I walked in cause it said TACOS MEXICO so that's a big bold statement. I ate a carne asada, with a burrito and they tasted so good, just like california makes. I was so happy when I left. It's a funky looking places, but the food was goooood. Just wish it wasen't in such a odd location and the place was more cleaner. I will come again! Good for family that do not care, and only care for food flavor."}
{"text":"Omg tacos. Yeah in love Mexican food. My hubby is Mexican so I get to eat this every day of I want to. Between he cooking and going to amazing place like this one. I am all set to eat good food. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Tacos Mexico is home to the most average, albeit filling, burrito in the area.   When you order, they ask if you want 'everything' on the 'rito. I said yes, but I'm still unsure of what everything is. There was no guac. No sour cream. No cheese. Nothing but rice, beans and al pastor. Weird.  For the low price of $5.70, you will leave full, and there's something to be said about that, but unsatisfied as well. My 'rito fell apart after first pickup and was dripping steaming hot 'rito runoff onto my wrist after each bite. Lame.   It's 24/7, so come here if you have that late night craving. Otherwise, driving 5-min in any direction will yield you a better meal for your bellay."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to authentic menudo ... it was disappointing - flavorless!  Really bland!  Not even the extra spices and salt helped.  It was like eating boiled tripe.  blech. And their super nachos?  They didn't use real cheese. Looked & tasted like velveeta!  We left and ate somewhere else. Wasted $$"}
{"text":"This is great homemade fast food, the portions are big and the price is right.  Perfectly cooked shrimp ceviche in tall glasses with tomato salsa.  Perfect horchata with not too much cinnamon; its a rice drink not a candy heart.  Al pastor taco is nicely seasoned and I can top it up with my own salsa choice.  Tough neighborhood crowd in the middle of the night but, everybody has to eat, right?"}
{"text":"Can't drive by without thinking about stopping and getting tacos. Went there late for a quick bite with some friends and it's really good at nite for some reason. I like the carnitas and al pastor tacos. Very authentic mexican tacos you'd find in Mexico."}
{"text":"The sad fact is that most yelpers will eschew this place for it's two more accessible neighbors - Filiberto's and La Santisma - and that is a damn shame, because nestled right between those two restaurants is a superior dining experience.    Tacos Mexico is the truth.  Don't go expecting fancy furniture or Day of The Dead iconography - this place isn't trying to serve you a Disneyland version of Mexico - what it will give you is an authentic taste of some damn fine Mexican tacos.    PS - their red salsa will burn a hole in your tongue.  If you treat it gingerly, however, you will be treated to a flavor bomb like no other!"}
{"text":"It's an ok place.  Food is good.  Pretty the only thing open after hours.  To many homeless they  come up to us every time we eat for money.  Menu is limited.  Parking is good. Service is ok. Even when it's clean it looks dirty.  Restrooms are ok."}
{"text":"This is only 1 of a few Mexican restaurants I've gone to in the Las Vegas area, but I'm sure I can accurately say this is one of the best Mexican places I've eaten at. Also, being from New York my Mexican options are limited so that may not be in my favor. Still, it is extremely good. The restaurant can seem a bit shady because the menu is in Spanish and all the employees don't speak English, but it was worth the effort. And It doesn't take a Spanish vocabulary to order the food.   The food was served on plastic ware, nothing fancy, but for the price I didn't expect gold-plated dishes. The food was still really good; hot, fresh, authentic. The variety of food options was also impressive, but I would recommend the 3 taco special for around $6. Beware of the $1 charge for credit but totally worth it if you don't have the cash."}
{"text":"Love the lengua tacos and it's only $1.99 each! One of the best tacos I've ever had. The place is clean & the service is good."}
{"text":"Ok, this is basically street food.  It isn't fancy. It isn't expensive.  It isn't gourmet.  It is authentic Mexican food...and it is amazing.  Their burritos are just phenomenal...and gigantic!  For 3.50 you can get a 3lb burrito.  It  is excellent.  Learn just enough Spanish to order...and have fun!"}
{"text":"This place was the best, the woman from venezuela was too beautiful lol oh, and the staff was cool, hahhaha the michealada or whateva its called was good, even though i dont drink alcohol too often, the tacos was delicious, the crowd was full, but the staff made us feel like we was back in texas, so much food, love yall, thanks from texas"}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place. The food is decent and the atmosphere a crappy to-go spot. If you're dying of hunger and not willing to brave the lines at the neighboring In-N-Out burger, this is a fair option. I don't get the sense they're ever really busy. It's not like the taco place on Sahara a few minutes away...."}
{"text":"By far the MOST EXPENSIVE taco shop I have ever been to! $15.00 for a plain, cheese quesadilla and (4) rolled tacos, these were NOT combination plates either. No rice and beans, just the quesadilla and rolled tacos! I was so shocked by these prices considering the same items cost me less that $10 at any Roberto's or Don Tortaco! Not only is this place expensive, the cheese they use has a weird flavor to it that I did not enjoy. Fortunately, I was able to give my expensive meal to a, very appreciative homeless person, so it wasn't a total waste. The shop itself is pretty ghetto with a broken back door and just, overall dirtiness/run down on the inside. You would think with the prices they charge, they could fix the place up a bit! Needless to say, I will never go to this place again."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos al pastor I've ever had.  As good as any of the taco places in SoCal.  It's located in a sketchy part of town but there's a drive-through, so no problem."}
{"text":"Holy shit if you want the worst service in the world and a rat burrito come here. We waited 20 min for shit burritos . Please don't go here . It is the worst place in Vegas . I love Mexican foood and if you do too don't spend money here."}
{"text":"Excellent tasty Mexican food! We were so excited to come and try this place and it did not disappoint! From the delicious tacos to the  authentic hot sauces, we have found our new go to mexican place!"}
{"text":"I LOVE TACOS!  I am so happy this place opened.  They bring me back to Mexico.   The tacos are small and delicious the way they should be.  You're looking at 2.50 - 3.00 a taco.    Margaritas are fantastic.   The lime pops in your mouth.   Go here and support the little guy. Taco taco!   They do have enchiladas and other great Mexican favorites."}
{"text":"This place is usually really good!!! But TONIGHT who ever was doing the cooking was terrible!!!  How disappointing. I had tacos al pastor.. the meat had alot of fat. We also got an order of fries with meat loaded with fat( puro  gordo) I did not enjoy my food at all.. It was a waist of money"}
{"text":"The worse tacos and mexican food in vegas!! Jezz the cook was piss when i order some chiles dorados!!! He says !! We dont do that in here, becarefull people !! Find some better place to eat"}
{"text":"I am basing this review strictly on their \"CARNE ASADA BURRITO\".   I've been frequenting this place for years. I've tried the other Tacos Mexico chains around town, but for some reason the one on the EASTCYDE tastes better to me. I'm probably just trippin.  Located on Maryland Parkway and Charleston blvd.  Grimy. You gotta love it.   These folks are open 24/7. Late night grinds are great here, but use the buddy system.  Now back to said subject...  Oh their CARNE ASADA BURRITO... I remember when this beast was less than $5.00.  This burrito to me has stolen my heart. I've tried other burritos at other joints.  They were all very good, but I find myself comparing them to the Tacos Mexico CARNE ASADA BURRITO on Charleston and Maryland.  A perfect combination of beans, Spanish rice, onions, and asada. Always comes out solid and greaseless. I always opt for Chile for that extra kick, and then I dump their red hot sauce all over that thing. The girth of this burrito will make you blush!!!  Till this day, I will always support Tacos Mexico's carne asada burrito.   EYE LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite taco place in Vegas    All the ladies who work there are really nice, and I've never had an error in my order, and it's super cheap."}
{"text":"My Dad's office is just up the street, so I've been coming here with him for years since I was a kid. I really enjoy lunch special that comes with 3 tacos, beans, rice, and a horchata. Very tasty. Although, over the years it has gotten more expensive. It started out costing $4.50 for the lunch special and now it is around $7."}
{"text":"Que ricooooooooooooooo!   We picked up a couple of late-night burritos (after playing Galaga, of course) and were sooooooo happy. Sure the place was a little sketchy at 1 am but who cares - the burritos were delicious.   They had the perfect blend of spice, rice, cheese, beans and meat! I don't care that they're a chain - the food's good!"}
{"text":"This place is not in the best neighborhood, but the people are harmless. A few friends and I rode our bikes downtown for some drinks and we stopped here on the way home. We were actually trying to go to the Mexican food truck that is usually parked nearby, but it was pulling away as we rode up to it. So we rode our bikes back up to Tacos Mexico. Sure there were some weirdos lingering around this place, but nothing too crazy.   Great place to grab some tacos or etc on your way home. We weren't the only ones grabbing food, there seem to be quite a few with the same idea. I got my usual carne asada tacos and they were really good. Soft corn tortillas are my favorite way to have tacos. I love that they are open 24 hrs. Staff is pretty friendly.  Pro Tip: The salsa stand has really small 1 oz. portion cups , but you can ask for bigger ones behind the counter."}
{"text":"Another late night hunger fix. I was out and about last night near downtown, so this place was on my way home. I ordered the taquitos with everything (lettuce, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, slice of tomato and rice and beans) The menu is basically in Spanish... so I guess I shouldn't' have been surprised when the women could not speak or understand any English.  It was touch and go interacting with her... I'm shocked I got what I ordered. Without asking they give you two extra small green sauce and two extra small red sauce containers. I'd rather they ask my preference and give me more of just one, but next time I'll just ask for extra.   I ordered the taquitos with beef, but I heard her say \"pollo\" several times to the cook... so at least 3 times I confirmed that I ordered beef. On the 3rd time she finally got it and started screaming a bunch of things to the cook, the only one I understood being \"carne asada\" so keep an eye on her.   The taquitos and toppings were really good. Easily some of the best I've had. Green sauce was great. The rice and beans were absolutely terrible. Inedible. I know I shouldn't be expecting much from rice and beans at drive thru late night taco stand, but this was seriously terrible.   There's a $1 charge to use credit cards, so bring cash. My total price was under $10 including the extra charge.  I would definitely return for the taquitos and/or to try the tacos next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this authentic Mexican taco joint for almost 10 years now.  Why?  Because it's quite far from where we live now.  Since we were in the neighbourhood, we decided to come here for a quick meal after we attended the Vegas Golden Knights \"Stick Salute\" rally on Fremont Street in downtown.  There were only 2 other people inside eating when we arrived at around 7:30 pm.  The restaurant looks the same inside.  The tacos are now $1.69 each, while 10 years ago it was only $0.99 each.  The menu on the wall is all in Spanish.  I don't remember what it was 10 years ago.  They don't have English menu, so you have to ask the cashier to describe to you what is on their menu.  We ordered 4 tacos - Al Pastor (Pork marinated), Carnitas (Fried Pork), Lengua (Beef tongue) and Cabeza (Beef cheek). We also ordered a Cabeza Burrito and a large Horchata to share.  Our order was ready in less than 3 minutes.  The Carnitas taco was a little dry, but the rest of the items were all quite tasty.  The meats were fresh and we especially enjoyed the Cabeza burrito.  I would recommend coming here if you need a cheap and quick authentic Mexican taco fix. Just be mindful of your surroundings, as this is not the safest area to be in."}
{"text":"Everything's just so halfassed, I ordered chicken tacos and instead of grilling the chicken, they like boiled it or something bc the chicken had no grilled taste to it whatsoever.   However, It's almost 3 am and I just wanted tacos and this was the closest to me.   Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else, where they actually care about the quality of their food, and the cleanliness, I've had tacos from taco trucks that shit on this place.   Only recommend the horchata tbh"}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING!!!! i normally eat at my local tacos mexico in los angeles so i figured i would stop by this one when i saw it driving from downtown vegas to the strip. i ordered 1 each of pork and chicken tamales. BAD decision. i experienced food poisoning within 9 hrs. (symptomatic from both ends, if you know what i mean) if this place had an LA county food inspection rating. it probably be a C. Ambience??!! this place has wrought iron gating around the windows and double entrance! (that should have been my 1st clue to dine elsewhere) i do not recommend this place"}
{"text":"8:00 PM Lonely on a business travel a snowy day. This Taco restaurant is the part of sun I'm missing. Great service, warm welcome, excellent food. Real, real Mexican. Try the tripe soup and add a lot of lime juice. This is a must. Delicious.Thank you very much for this excellent meal.  Do not miss this restaurant when you pass by."}
{"text":"Tacos Mexico is really close to where I live and so I've been here a few times.  The decor, both outside and inside, leaves something to be desired.  Outside the signs don't fully light up and inside is fairly messy.  There are some arcade machines in a corner, some working, some not, and the lighting is overly bright.  There is a drive-thru, but it's the type where you drive up to the window and order -- there is no microphone or anything.    Despite appearances, the food is good when it's made correctly.  I've gotten tacos, of which you can get a lot of different types and flavors of beef and chicken, and quesadillas which offer the same choices.  With the quesadillas they come with nacho chips, beans, and lettuce.  Every time I've gone there and asked for it without lettuce they always put the lettuce in anyway.  I've resorted to telling them I'm allergic to lettuce, even though I'm not, but it seems to make no difference.  I'm sorry but I don't like lettuce and I don't want my quesadilla covered in it and soggy.  One time I gave it back to them and told them I didn't want lettuce and watched the cook open the box, take some of the lettuce out, close it up and give it back to me.  Yuck.  So, I try to keep it simple and just get tacos now.  Prices are good and it's both cheaper and a lot better and much more authentic than places like Taco Bell.  As a plus they are open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Soo gross! I walked in here with my husband for tacos.  I ordered 2 of pastor, 2 lengua and 1 buche.  We ordered 2 drinks: 1 horchata and 1 tamarindo(these drinks are not from scratch but made from pre made powder).  The tacos were soo bad.  The tortilla was a little cold, and quickly got soggy.  The meat on the tacos was not hot at all.  It was kind of room temp.  The only taco that had warm meat was the buche taco but this taco was dripping in fat.  That's what made my tacos soggy.  Please don't come here to eat!!!  I went to the salsa bar to get some radishes to eat with the tacos but I was grossed out when I saw that some of these were brownish.  The establishment was very dirty, and is in need of remodeling.  I don't understand how this place has gotten the good reviews that it has.  Look at pics to see how dirty this place was."}
{"text":"So so at best, definitely not deserving of 5stars as previous reviews suggested.  Had to ask for chips and salsa and both were blah.  The shrimp tacos were flavorless.  The beef fajitas did not come on a sizzling skillet like most Mexican restaurants and did not include lettuce, cheese, sour cream and we had to ask for tortillas.  The chimichangas were not like any I've had before.  They are big on adding feta cheese on most of their entrees and that's just plain weird for Mexican food.  I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place kind of slow but great food wish they had more taco mexicos in cali. Everytime we come to vegas this is a must stop for us for some reason it taste better out here anyways"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service and terrible food, unless you enjoy greasy a** food. Usually \"fast food\" is greasy but it is like they dip their food in straight up grease and leave it soaking in there.   I came here a month or so ago two times and had their tacos on a Wednesday. Customer service was great and so were the carnitas taco. The tacos had just the right amount of meat and the tacos were not as soggy. But recently, I ordered the carne asada fries, the service was thumbs down just as much as the food. The lady had us waiting for 5 minutes + until she finally saw us (She was too busy on the phone to check the drive thru). Then when we went inside to get forks, napkins, and salsa because she didn't place any inside our bag, we noticed how filthy the dinning area was. Honestly - when you're at work , work.   I only took a couple of bites of the fries until I wanted to puke. A waste of $7 , idk why they have high stars - unless it's for the 79 cent tacos on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"I thought the food was fairly authentic but it wasn't great. The outside and inside of the place was kinda dingy but I care more about how the food tastes than what the place looks like. This is the kinda place I'd probably give 4 or 5 stars to if I stopped by at 3am after hanging out all night but such was not the case on this visit. If you've even been to Taco Cabana in Texas, this is similar but more authentic mexican food."}
{"text":"This place should be called Taco Chingon   Bars on windows and doors-Check I was the only non Hispanic - Check A little dirty- Check Did not have to ask for corn tortillas- Check Home made salsas - Check  This was the real deal.  Just past the Stratosphere. Tacos were about 1$ and some change.  Had to stop here on the way back from the Premium outlets.  The tacos pastor were very good.  It was shredded pork and grilled onions.  Extra cilantro, spicy salsa and lemon is how I do it.  The carne asada was really good, Perfectly seasoned, and only a couple of chewy pieces of meat!  They were not greasy They also had pazole, but that is not something you eat before hitting the strip.   Every time I come to Vegas I have to get one taco from this joint.  If you want some good no frills Mexican this is the spot. Better than most places that I have had in Mexico. I suppose this could be a bit sketchy late night, but that is half the fun esé !  My only complaint is that the hot salsa could have been a bit more spicy.  The prices are listed on menu, so I'm not sure what that other person was talking about."}
{"text":"Last night me and my two friends stopped to get couple tacos before going home.   Not only everything did not taste good. Today all 3 of us suffering from food poisoning."}
{"text":"The tacos are AMAZING!!!!!!!! I had 4 tacos, 3 tacos de lengua and 1 de tripa. Sooooo good! I also realized after I ate the tripa was actually chitterlings, something I said I would never eat! The restaurant as a whole looks like a hole in the wall and most people probably wouldn't even think to stop and eat. I highly recommend stopping and eating here! The staff was very friendly and the place was clean! Also, this was a great google find because I don't live in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Fried. Intestine. Tacos.  Yes, yes..I know it may sound gross...and if you really think about it then, maybe it is.. BUTTTTTTTTT, it's DEEP FRIED GOODNESS! And in a taco form. The lime, the tortilla.....everything just works. Reminds me a lot of Kogi tacos which, you know I love to death.  Best part is it's cheap! $1.50 each. Cost less than my drink did."}
{"text":"Cheap & delicious. This shop's location make it like a live theatre reality show. Always something going on!"}
{"text":"The Food we ordered was very uncooked and was near edible. Chicken in my burrito was pink !! The fries in my Carne asada fries were soggy and the meat was horrible ! Unsatisfying Experience"}
{"text":"Didn't stay took tacos to go.  it was cute inside and lots of seating in the restaurant. Every corner you looked at had something interesting that would catch your eye. Maybe next time all stick around and eat in.  I was having a craving for tacos for days.  Probably because I have been looking up Mexico vacations and dreaming of getting away from the snow. so for a quick lunch I ordered some tacos to go.  Lots of different options Good thing I was sharing that way I got to try more options. 2 tacos for 5$ between 2 people sharing = me trying more tacos, yum!   All of our selections were delicious it was like I was in Mexico."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes in line and still couldn't order. The cashier has no idea what she was doing. Couldn't take a simple order. Unorganized staff and the place was dirty."}
{"text":"This place was disgusting food tasted like chemicals I will never come back and I dont recommend it to anyone either"}
{"text":"this place rocks.  Cheap tacos, Great taste.  The asada tacos were pretty damn good with the salsa on it.  It needs a little lemon but all together it was awesome!!!  The carnitas were even better.  Its hard to find good carnitas and this was really good."}
{"text":"On a good day this place is great. On most days, the tacos are swimming in grease and sometime the carne asada meat tastes days old. Taco Wednesdays 70 cent tacos is the reason I gave this place so many chances. Hopefully they start to put more care into their food. Ive had great meals here."}
{"text":"First time here last Friday with work peeps for lunch.   Small restaurant with bar area and open kitchen.   Staff are super friendly and menu is perfect size with enough choices without being overwhelmed.   Ordered the tacos with pork and ground beef but will give the nod to the pork. It was a little greasy in a good way and so so yummy. You got four soft tacos for $10 which is a fantastic deal.   Lots of liquor choices but it was a work lunch   Overall if you're into Mexican food can't go wrong with Taco Mexico!"}
{"text":"Grew up in San Diego, and I remembered going to a local taco food spot as a kid. Late 70s - 80's, before the majors \"...bertos\" , it eventually became places like Alberto's, Robertos, Adalbertos, Rombertos, etc... haha, you get the point. But as of late I used to think, Carne Asada Burritos weren't the same because, after countless times eaten over the decades, you just get desensitized and that's like with a lot of things from childhood. At least that's the excuse I had in my head. But the first time I ate here, the flavor of burrito struck a chord of memories, and deliciousness. Made me realize, that some of these so called big Mexican food chains, are getting over on us. Here's my observation after 4 times eating here. I watched the cook cook the meat. First, he did it the way I remembered as a kid, laid it on the grill, unchopped, then after cooked, then chopped (holds on to flavor better). If you notice, most of these \"..berto\" style joints or \"Don yadayada\" , prechop meat and cook it, let it sit in warm tub, and cook it again to order, (tough and grissel). That's the meat comparison. Now, out of the 4 times that I am basing my review, the one time I saw that meat already chopped in a tub used, it was not to great, but surprisingly, still better than the competition. Maybe because it's because it's cooked in that particular better sequence. The rest of other ingredients seem fresher as well. Sour cream and guacamole is thicker. Pico de gallo, seems very fresh as well. And price is a big plus!!  BTW-Only negative(does not effect star rating cuz you just need to be aware), make sure you don't get beans and rice in burrito - it's a San Diego thing ;), taste much better. I grew up with that stuff on the side, I think it's much better that way anyways."}
{"text":"Kinda ghetto on the outside... and inside...   No vegetarian option"}
{"text":"Was greeted in the drive thru with \"give me a minute.\" I waited approx 5 minutes. I really wanted tacos so I waited. Ordered 2 tacos de pollo y 2 de carnitas. The pollo were good. The carnitas was dry and tasteless. Not whole lot of customer service going on. It might explain why cook at home."}
{"text":"Quite good. Reasonable prices. Near Stratosphere.  You couldn't perform any kind of surgery in this place.....it's kinda grimy (root word being grim).....so get take-out.  No one's wearing latex gloves or anything.  (Hmmm, operating-room-motif is emerging, but then again, most kitchens have become like operating rooms.)  Tacos are a little over $1.  (Tacos el Gordo take a hint!!!!  $2 is too much for a damn taco!!!!!) They have exotic meats like tongue and belly and head and others fleshy parts. Food is tasty no question.  Would I go back? Unlikely. If I was tired and didn't want to travel too far? Probably. Would I admit that I even went there? Not likely.  So forget you read this review."}
{"text":"Great authentic little Mexican restaurant. Picture a taco stand but in a standalone building. The food is very good."}
{"text":"Whelp, I finally made a food mistake. I came here. Carne asada fries. Undercooked hard grease soaked fries. Ground paste beef. Definitely not carne asada. Definitely not stomach friendly. I returned it to the counter after two bites. Absolutely unsafe tasting  food for a hungry after work  bite."}
{"text":"really good real mex food . when you are there don't be afraid . it is all good . good to people watch but don't stair. pd . fd, hp, cruz in for a quick taco fix. cheep and fast take six taco with you to go"}
{"text":"A lot of times when I'm in Vegas I'll gamble for long stretches without eating, so by the time I am ready to eat I'm usually;  A) famished  and   B) broke  When that happens, nothing fits the bill better than Tacos Mexico.  The tacos are great and not only that, but they're dirt cheap, typically ~$1.00-1.25 apiece, depending on what kind you get.  I'll stop there for breakfast (yes, breakfast - they're open 24/7) and have 6 or 8 tacos.   For about $10 I'm stuffed.  One of the best things about Tacos Mexico is that you can get tacos made with a lot of exotic meats that you don't find at many places.  Instead of just the usual beef/chicken/fish tacos you can also get tripe, cabeza, intestine, tounge meat, etc.   They also make an awesome bowl of menudo (tripe soup) for ~$6.  As many have noted, this place is kind of dumpy but who cares?  If I want to take my wife for a fancy meal then I'll go to a nice steakhouse or one of the fancy buffets, but when I'm by myself and just looking for some quick, cheap, tasty food, Tacos Mexico is my first choice in Vegas."}
{"text":"Most disgusting place ever. Ordered carne asada fries and a shrimp taco. Cashier was the biggest idiot who attempted to charge me 1 min after I handed her a 20 dollar bill. She was trying to help me and the other 3 people whom were all complaining at the same time. After waiting forever for my food, the people with me were already done, I requested a refund; I no longer wanted to wait. The cashier points to a sign that states no refunds on food. This should be your #1 clue to stay the hell away from this place. You might as well just actually throw your money in the trash cause that's what you're doing at this place. I walked out leaving the entire order on the table."}
{"text":"yuck. be afraid, be very afraid. to be fair, they had lots of cool toppings stocked at the bar and my chicken quesadilla was good and had quality cheese, but it was also a freakin quesadilla.   my poor friend, who was visiting from france, lol, tried the menudo--it was literally topped with a 1 inch layer of water and looked as tough as a bull's asscheek. the decor is diner-meets-out of business motel(equipped with deceiving signs about its rich historical legacy, blablabla). You can't just screw up menudo at a mexican place.   I highly recommend El Sombrero Cafe on south main street(if you haven't been there and feel a drift of mexican fever, get in the your car ASAP)."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Town period. Go on wensday $0.70 tacos asada or carnitas. Other locations do this monday and wensday. Great after a late night of sin city, Lunch or pick up 20 on your way home."}
{"text":"Worst spot to come to saw it by our hotel we went not only did it take 20 mins for three tacos and a burrito once we got our food 1 taco that was of chicken was not fully cooked still pink!! The meat supposedly carne asada was horrible has a greasy film the worst dodnt even eat our food STAY AWAY!!"}
{"text":"I hate to do this and I have held off on doing this for so long but I need to share when it comes to complete and utter dismay.   It  has become that.  This used to be my go to place but when I had to change to asada V/S pastor (pastor is my fav) I continued on and tried other dishes.  Because I loved this place they were my first in Vegas true mexican food place in town.  I use to savor the idea of this place, wait and withhold my diet to come to this place to splurge to have this place then I came to avoid this place.  It started when I ordered a Pastor burrito and it had pineapple in it.  I didn't order a canadian pizza if I wanted pineapple I would have asked for it.  As I said I avoided it for awhile but on the way home from a movie we though what the heck it used to be good food give it another shot!  So the boyfriend got a Pastor and I just couldn't give my full confidence so I got the Asada.  We got home and they both sucked.  No longer the pineapple in the pastor but it was old and mushy the rice was barely rice it was mush, mine was mainly gristle I kept biting and chewing and spitting out, I finally gave up and went to bed hungry.  Ugh  So my favorite went to my least favorite, I wanted it to become my favorite again but, I will never go back it will now be least favorite...  Good luck I won't be back, ever..."}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars. I saw this place and stopped in for b fast. The bf menu was limited so I ordered a lengua burrito with beans & rice. The friendly waitress asked if I wanted onions, cilantro and salsa which I advised her yes.  When I received my burrito and coffee the size was generous. The lengua was tender and the mixture of all the ingredients was yummy.  I added additional salsa to really give it a spicier kick and the burrito was filling. Coffee here is decent too.  Enjoyable bf and I'm glad I drove by McDonald's and into this place."}
{"text":"I am from San Diego and visited this facility on Wednesday with my family in hopes of some delicious Mexican food. Unfortunately, it was terrible. I ordered 2 of the Carne Asada Fries and 2 carne asada tacos and 3 drinks. The total was overpriced at  $25.  The tacos were small treet tacos and the carne asada fries were a small saucer size serving. The carne asada fries has some nasty nacho cheese, which I have never seen on carne asada fries before. I have to say this was the worst mexican food I have ever had in my life! I will never come back to that place. BTW they get 1 star because I cannot post with no stars."}
{"text":"I see this chain all over Vegas so when I really had no choice to dine here as I was \"held against my will\" aka I wasn't driving & paying for the food, I definitely had my taste buds heightened to compare it to other Mexican joints.   I ended up getting a lunch special where you get 3 tacos (I opted on the carne asada ones), beans, rice and a handful of chips. I unfortunately was not impressed #sadface as I was hoping it would make me turn my back on Tacos El Gordo since there's a helluvah lot more Tacos Mexico than there are Tacos El Gordos.   The meat was a bit dry, the chips stale, and I only really liked the beans! But that's beans!!! That's like me only liking the ketchup at Denny's! Plus they messed up on my order that I will now forever be a Tacos El Gordo Loyalist."}
{"text":"Woke up craving tacos at 430 and decided to come give this place a try. It's a very tiny place but has a drive-thru window. I decided to go because I like to gather my own salsas and stuff. The place was clean inside but they can really use a new menu. Luckily I knew what I wanted and didn't care about the price. They have a hand written sign for taco pricing and a few pictures for their combos.  I ended up getting two carne asada burritos and a large Jamaica for like $15. I have no complaints about the food what so ever. My food was ready before I was done filling up my four little salsa cups. The meat was very tender. Only thing is, if you don't like spicy foods like my bf, do not get any salsa at all! I had the red in my burrito and got green on the side for him. The green is suppose to mild but this one is a hot mild. Almost seemed a bit spicier than the red.  I will be coming back. Think they have $0.70. Tacos on Wednesdays as well."}
{"text":"This place used to be good. I came here last night and ordered the asada burrito and it was all fatty, chewy pieces! By the time I finished I had a pile of meat on my plate that I had to throw away! I was so disappointed. My boyfriend on the other hand had the carnitas burrito which was fine. Never coming here again!!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here even tho I've checked in only twice. That goes to show that all I can think about is their tacos and burritos!!! I have to say they do have the best Carne Asada tacos I've ever had in Vegas hands down..so simple yet no lack in the flavor department!!! Red a green sauce go perfect with them!! All made in house I must say!! A must if you are ever near by!!"}
{"text":"Best menudo I go there 2 to 3 times a week the service is great and prices a real good also the girl that works there is very polite I recommend this place"}
{"text":"This has been the only Tacos Mexico that I have ever been to since the one out in Montclair, CA in the I.E. shut down for some unknown reason.  Every time I am in Las Vegas, I make at least one stop (usually late night) to this mecca of Mexican food goodness.   The carne asada, al pastor, and carnitas tacos are always a favorite of mine. The amount of meat that they put on their tacos is always comparable to the size of the corn tortillas they serve them on.  Another thing I typically get is the tostada with carne asada. Now here is a generous serving of meat. The way the refried beans mingle with the lettuce, meat, salsa, tomato, and cheese complete with the satisfying crunch of the tostada.. Mmm, Mmm!! It doesn't get any better than that!  My drink of choice here has always been the jamaica. I've always liked hibiscus tea leaves and they do a very good job of it here. It's definitely worth stopping by here. In fact, it's one of the places I look forward to going every time I plan a Vegas trip."}
{"text":"This place is good if you are hungry and just want some ok Mexican food. The staff is friendly and pretty fast through the drive thru. The tacos are really small, I ordered steak and they definitely aren't your average size tacos but they are good! I also ordered nachos which I would suggest skipping all together as they are a bit mediocre and lacking in flavor. The guacamole was a bit watery and the cheese was just melted shredded cheese. The horchata was good and the churro was hot. The food however did make me sick the next day, I am not sure if this was just a fluke. I would recommend for a quick bite late at night."}
{"text":"Don't go here if you're looking for a place for a first date... but after y'all get to know each other, THIS IS THE SPOT. The lengua is super yummy, & for Wednesday munchies... can't get no better .70 tacos"}
{"text":"I'm from LA and happen to live in centennial hills now so j haven't had some good authentic Mexican food in a while.....maybe that's why but this place blew my mind...I ordered a bean and cheese and was annoyed it cost me $6 but when I got my burrito I realized why... HUGE. Typical Decor and wasn't the cleanest but well worth it. Whole menu is in Spanish employees are very nice but not so helpful. I will definitely be stopping here every time I'm on this side of town"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican tacos and borritos! This is a great street food shack that I have been frequenting for close to 15 years. Modest, down to earth decor and atmosphere, friendly staff, great tacos!! My favorites are Tacos de Cabeza (beef head), Tacos de Lengua (beef tongue), Tacos de Tripas (beef intestines), the kind of bold flavors and textures you don't always find in other taquerias. Always best accompanied with the house Orchata (rice drink)."}
{"text":"The al pastor tacos taste like a SLIM JIM.   The sope was good, the rice had an interesting flavor, and the beans were runny. The salsa was decent."}
{"text":"BEST Tacos Off the Strip!  How there are no other reviews of this place IDK!  It is always busy, It's Open late It has A drive thru it's Cheap and it is damn good.  I almost forgot it's ONLY 5 minutes west of the strip near IN & Out. Check it Out!!  I love the carne asada so I always get 6-8 tacos and 2 churros to go. It always hits the spot."}
{"text":"This location is horrible, I walked in and ordered 4 tacos with meat and cheese only.  The tacos  came out 5 minutes later and the food was not even cooked. I asked the lady what she just served me and she laughed.  I almost lost my cool because it took 30 mins to issue a refund for $12 in tacos, I am fed up & disgusted"}
{"text":"Tacos Mexico Looks like the prefect hole in the wall gem but food lacks in everything that would make it great Condiment bar was low and does not appear fresh  Bathrooms- OK clean We got 6 tacos and 2 drinks for $16.00 But they have .70 tacos on Wednesday  Service was OK No free refills Perk- Drive thru and dine in  Carne asada- taste homemade but nothing spectacular feel like it's missing a lot  Al pastor- this was our favorite it's full of flavor with plenty of meat  Carnitas- was lacking in everything especially meat. Felt like I was eating tortilla taco.   Overall rating 3 stars but might be back to give it another try"}
{"text":"Ever since the Tropicana location closed this is my go to spot. Tacos are exactly what you're looking for in Mexican street food. Salsas are always on point as well"}
{"text":"Craving tacos again late at night I decided to try this place out again. At about $.99 - $1.09 a taco its a decent value. I tried the Carnitas, Lengua, Chorizo and Chicharon tacos this time around. They were all tasty and hit the spot. In the past they once had a hot sauce that came on everything but seems to be gone now and all they offer is the red and green sauce in the condiments bin."}
{"text":"Location and drive thru are pretty much the only great things about this place. If you're looking for a plain jane taco and you happen to be close by then this is the place for you.   My personal experience only involves the drive thru on many occasions so I don't know how clean it is on the inside. Their wait time is fast but double check and make sure your order is correct since the speaker is usually broken and they ask for your order 3 times.   Be careful if you are going at night, there is usually a homeless person that will approach you in the drive thru.   The location is in between a denny's and the stratosphere."}
{"text":"Overall the service is great and the food is fair. Meat was not salted enough and the taco itself felt chalky. I've only been here once and I'd give it another shot but I'm gonna keep looking because between my tacos and I, it's a true telenovela."}
{"text":"Tacos Mexico is quite affordable, but I can't say that I would probably come here again. The menu is all in Spanish, which I can't really read, but thank goodness for the pictures!   The food is cheap, and these tacos seem authentic and taste decent. They also come out with it pretty fast. I can say however, my carne asada tacos were a little dry coming out, and so was the tortilla that it came with.  Parking is easy over here, you shouldn't have a problem trying to find one in this lot."}
{"text":"Stopped in on our way thru vegas coming from a hike in utah. Having not eaten much today, all 4 of us were starved. The food was bland at best. I eat mexican food regularly, and all of us thought the food was bland. And it was 20 for just my girlfriend and I. We come to vegas to hike red rocks regularly...this won't be a place we come back to"}
{"text":"The carne asada taco was amazing!! Very flavorful! And the chicken taco was really good to! Very friendly people to serve you! Will defiantly be back! And they have a couple pin ball machines!"}
{"text":"Came here for Taco Tuesday, drive past this place daily. The line wasn't long but the line waiting for the food was very long! We ordered carnitas, carne asada, chorizo, and pastor. We ordered 10 tacos and waited over 30 mins. Our corn tortillas were tough like they had been sitting. The food itself was just ok... Really IMO Salsitas is better... I doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"Came in to try the 0.70 cent tacos (Weds) but I ended up waiting 20 min. For 5 carnitas tacos!  And it was not busy at all. I watched people who came in after me get their orders. My blood was boiling by the time I left. Thank god I got them to go! As for the tacos, they were ok--a little greasy. I liked the green sauce--not too spicy.   However something about this location just brings in the crazies too. Customers including myself were being harrased by someone who came in off the street. Management did nothing so I guess its common.  Overall 2 stars- mainly for the food. The atmospre is terrible. Maybe I will visit a different location because the food wasn't bad."}
{"text":"I love mexican food. I love mexican food that's not in Canada.  We are big fans of  trying different types of tacos wherever we go and this place had a fair selection. They were great. I tried the nacho's and they were tasty as well.   I know it's a chain, but it's pretty good regardless. The food is priced reasonably well and their horchata is awesome as per the boyfriend.  The only complaint I have were the characters that came in to eat.. I was getting scared there for a while. I shall say no more."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican place in town. You'd think that being so close to Mexico, California and Arizona that Las Vegas would have no shortage of decent Mexican restaurants. But no... anyway, when I first drove by and saw what a horrible little shit hole it was (before the paint job and spruce up) that I knew this place had to be good. I was not disappointed. Muy authentico."}
{"text":"Menu all in Mexican = authentic...or rather \"autentico!\"   Decent mexi, but cash only - so come prepared.    I wish I had a more thorough review, but since we went at 10AM on a Saturday morning, all I was tasting was last night's cocktails.  Thank God for carne asada."}
{"text":"Ok, so don't go here if you plan on being \"dainty\" or if you don't want your skirt to get dirty.  BUT, if you just want gooooood food and don't mind the blaring tex-mex polka music on the juke box....Taco's Mexico is the place.  Its AUTHENTIC Mexican food.  Say it with me people, AWWTHENTIC.  No, you won't get del taco or taco bell crap here.   There is a wide variety of meats to choose from.  Stick with the carnitas, carne asada, or al pastor.  But if you're adventurous, try the sesos, cabeza or lengua. To me, its YUCK (and I'm hispanic).  The tacos are made on little round corn tortillas, with just meat, onions, cilantro and hot sauce.  Make sure you order plenty (4 at least) cuz they are small.   The burritos, however, are GINORMUS.  They pile on the meat, cheese, beans, rice, and salsa - or you can customize them any way you want..  HOLY CRAP.  Their menu has more on it than just tacos and burritos.  I recommend you try the sopes or the tortas (sandwiches).  BONUS: this place is CHEAP.  And take a Spanish speaking buddy.  They will treat you better if you speak the language. - see TIP below.  TIP: however, don't try to speak Spanish if you don't know how.  Believe me, they will respect you more if you're just a gringo with good taste in food."}
{"text":"The lady at the front register is super rude !! Worse service ever. I didn't get her name but she has no eyebrows dark skin hispanic."}
{"text":"Just ok. I am on the toilet dealing with the ramifications of eating their nachos late last night. Taco meat is a bit dry and just eh.would skip this joint in the future."}
{"text":"Wow the food is authentic. We went to their new location at 51st Ave & Peoria Ave yesterday. We ordered chicken sopes, tacos de tripa a burrito, churros and drinks. Total bill was $35. The food was excellent! The staff is courteous and everything was very clean. We will definitely be back for $.85 tacos on Wednesday's!"}
{"text":"Make sure to check your receipt. The cashier charged me 9 dollars for a 6 dollar burrito.when I asked her about it she tried to tell me it was because of takes. Then because of a soda then finally she said it was just extra that day. And also the food is  basic at best.try tacos el Gordo or Pepe's instead save your self the hassle and disappointment.if you want great food stay away from here."}
{"text":"Thumbs up! The best Ive ever tried in Vegas (in Mexican food)yummy, can't wait to go back to Vegas and try their food. Nothing fancy. But you feel like if you were at a real taco shop in Mexico. Love it!. The personnel was very friendly. Thank you! Oh and it was cheap! I've never paid that amount in Vegas for two entrees!!! Lol"}
{"text":"This rating is based solely on the breakfast burrito. Almost 8 bucks for a greasy, flavorless mess with cheap eggs. No cilantro, no onion just ham,  egg and a little cheese. They need to go to Robertos and see how it's done. I have a stomach ache from the grease now. Their chicken tacos and lunch stuff is amazing not so much on the breakfast side."}
{"text":"I have been eating tacos and burritos here for 12+ years now, so I guess it is a good time to give this place a review.  Do I come here for the best tasting tacos and burritos in town?  I'D SAY NAY!  This place is super average. I came here recently and the carnitas tacos I infrequently get were, yet again, dry. They desperately needed the awesome green sauce this establishment makes to add much needed moisture and flavor. One of the few places in town that has spicy and flavorful green sauce.  The carne asada burrito I got was fully loaded and quite filling. But as usual,  the meat inside was dry and had the taste of hanging out in a heat warming bin for too long.  So why have I kept coming back for over a decade? Because they uphold a trinity of being consistent, cheap, and always being open 24/7. I can spend less than $15 and be full for the whole day, the tacos and burritos have always stayed average, and they have always been open when I was a broke high school student, a broke college student, and now as a broke working professional paying back his student loans.  I like this place and I'll keep coming back here. It serves cheap and and decent tasting Mexican food, 24/7. It's as simple as that."}
{"text":"THE GOOD:  1.) CONVENIENT - Late night food alternative that is close enough to the strip.  2.) INEXPENSIVE - especially after burning money on gambling, partying, and overpriced club drinks!  3.) QUICK SERVICE - It's a freaking fast food chain...it better be. 4.) MOSTLY TASTY GRUB - The tacos and burritos are pretty good. However, their Menudo really hits the spot....especially after a cold crazy night.  THE BAD:  1.) FOOD SUPPLY - They often run out of certain food items. 2.) FOOD QUALITY - There have been some menu items that was definitely a miss and not a hit (might just be bad preparation).  2.) INCONSISTENT SERVICE - Sometimes the service sucks.THEY FORGOT MY BURRITO!!!  3.) RUNDOWN VENUE - The restaurant is kinda cheesy: jacked up jukebox busting out the Mexican music, the old school tables/chairs, and the cleanliness of the front counter definitely doesn't win \"positive\" awards.  4.) SKETCHY AREA: There is a reason the place is caged up like minimum security prison. I've seen freaky things happen there - a guy beaten up and robbed right outside, the standard late-night fight between rowdy customers, and what looked to be an unfit teen mom with a half-naked baby that seemed to have horrible mouth sores (CALL CHILD SERVICES!!!)  THE FINAL VERDICT: TACOS MEXICO...SURE WHY NOT!?! Cheap, semi-dirty Mexican food is definitely a good cure after a Vegas night of partying, drunkenness, and debauchery. If you're above and beyond the clean, pricey late night eats within the strip (side note: GET OFF YOUR FREAKING HIGH HORSE!!!), then head down to the ghetto cuz Tacos Mexico definitely fits the bill!"}
{"text":"After dining on the Strip for 2 days, hubby and I were dying for some real Mexican food and were happy to see TACOS MEXICO. We each ordered 3 tacos, beans, and rice with drinks and paid a little over $11 (yoo hoo! big deal in Vegas).   The Al Pastor and Cabeza were my husband's favorites, very flavorful and juicy. The rice was also very good and the beans had a nice flavor. I loved their homemade salsas and did find them to be nice and spicy (I'm mexican, so I know spicy!). We asked for extra guacamole and they obliged. Quite yummy!  We've already decided that when we go back to Vegas we're avoiding restaurants on the Strip and heading there for lunch and dinner since they have other options besides tacos (posole!) and the prices were outstanding."}
{"text":"Late night out drinking? Need something to fill your food craving? This is that place. Perfect location for locals and tourist alike if you are in the mood for some serious street tacos."}
{"text":"You can't get anymore authentic than actually going to Mexico...San Diego was pretty close though. But now that I live in Las Vegas I can't seem to find a Mexican restaurant that can live up to Mexican authenticity.   So I did a drive-thru order for a chicken chimichanga burrito. Got the order paid about $9 with the extra $1 debit/credit card charge. Hmm.  Brought the food to my hotel room...ate it. Disliked it. Too salty. Got mad. Threw half of it out. Still hungry. Went to Jack in the Box. Got an order of tacos and stuffed jalapeños. Called it a night.   Would I go back?...No."}
{"text":"Tacos Mexico is AWESOME.  I loved the chorizo tacos and the posole.   I personally love the atmosphere, but I have a couple friends that are scared of eating there-- but I think they're just pansies.  This is the best Mexican food in town.  And you can't beat the prices!"}
{"text":"Although I know that there are Mexican establishments across the city that serve better fare, I have a special place for Tacos Mexicos strictly because of its' connection to my hometown...Friday nights in high school always ended up at Tacos Mexicos in Hacienda Heights for Carne Asada Tacos!  I HAD to yelp this particular Tacos Mexicos because it stands head and shoulders above the other locations in town...the food is cooked to order and always fresh compared to some of the mess you can find at the seedier locations throughout Vegas...  To boot, Miercoles is 60 cent taco night! Reminiscent of my days back in high school!!!"}
{"text":"The Mexican food is great and affordable but they were missing our order of birria. After waiting for a while, I asked for a refund and fortunately got one with no issues from the manager. Also, having 2 crackheads come in and making a scene didn't really help the dining atmosphere. It's nearby the Stratosphere but you're in the rough part of town. Even my husband (takes a lot to freak him out) had hairs standing. I'll stick to the one on Sahara & Valley View. FYI, $1 charge for using credit cards."}
{"text":"I remember eating here for the first time almost 10 years ago. Came in yesterday and was welcomed to the exact same worn down interior lol. The food is what I remembered it to be, good, cheap and simple. Can't really go wrong here with the street tacos."}
{"text":"We ordered nachos to start and 3 different tacos & shredded beef tostadas for the main course.   Our favorite tacos were the pork carnitas and chorizo. The chipotle beef was too saucy.   Very authentic flavors and the salsa and guacamole were delicious. We would definitely recommend this restaurant if you're craving Mexican food.  We can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Solid and cheap/tacos start at $1.09, 24 hours, 3-4 fresh salsas at the condiment stand with fresh radish and lime. Everything I've ever had has been good, not killer, but pretty darn good. I usually get burritos, tacos, or the pozole. I love it when an ethnic restaurant attracts a lot of people from the country they represent...this place does just that. For about the same price point as Taco Bell or Del Taco, this is a winner."}
{"text":"Spent a fun night in Vegas and drank way too much. Naturally my friends and I got the craving for some tacos and one of our friends suggested Tacos Mexico. I have had tacos Mexico before and I am not a fan, but our friend insisted that they were delicious here in Las Vegas. As you can probably tell by my one star review he was wrong. Not only did we wait a ridiculous amount of time waiting for the tacos, but once we got them they were awful. I picked at mine and maybe ate 6 pieces of meat and left everything else. I think I could have gotten past the horrible tacos, but the one thing that really led to this one star review was the horrible customer service. One of my friends was not feeling well and needed something to drink. I walked up to the register with 3 dollars and asked for a soda. The woman at the register looked at me with disdain and walked away from me. It's not the customers fault if you don't like your job, but at the end of the day you have a job because of the customer! I will NEVER go to another Tacos Mexico again in my life. I am not sure if this is their norm, but to me it was unacceptable customer service. I hope someone corrects the staff because this is not how you run a business."}
{"text":"Tried the head taco and it was okay. Also ordered the nachos and really was disappointed.. The lady who took my order wasn't very friendly and the lady who brought the food to the counter (where I picked it up) wasn't so cheerful either. They have a good salsa bar but it didnt look that fresh.  Will not be returning.."}
{"text":"Fantastic little Mexican joint close to home! This little strip mall holds my favourite sushi place, too.   I ordered the 4 taco lunch with pop for $10. A real bargain! I got 2 al pastor, 1 barbacoa, and 1 with pork rinds. The meat was nicely flavoured, very tender and not dry. It was so good and left me satisfied! Also got the chips and salsa, the salsa was nice and peppery and fresh with cilantro and onions.   Service was friendly and fast. All in all, I'm so happy there is a nice place close to home. I hope these guys are here for a very long time, as I know the location has seen a lot of turnover."}
{"text":"It was OK. The bathroom was messy, the food was skimpy and prices are unnecessarily high. The quesedilla was 7 bucks and barely had meat and was extra greasy. Street tacos were $2 but they were OK.  Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. It's not worth anything to stop and eat here."}
{"text":"I have visited this place a few times now, a couple of times not so sober and I remember it was good then...  More recently I went back during lunch and the expeirence was not so stellar. The carne asada i got on my tacos had huge chucks of fat on them, I get trying to cut corners but if tacos jsut come with meat and tortilla make sure the meat is good. It was a bad experience, I guess I should go back to see if it was a fluke but don't really wanna watse a lunch when there are so many other good options out there.   Only good point it that it is cheap but you get what you pay for here, fat tacos not carne asada."}
{"text":"Food is great but I'm really upset that I've been here 2x in 1 month and their debit machine is always down.  I ordered my food right now and since their machine was down and I never carry cash on me I had to cut my order in half since I didn't have enough cash on me.  I asked to write a check and they said no.  So it's their fault I can't use a credit card or debit card and I'm the one that pays for it"}
{"text":"The perfect place to get your taco fix fixed!  This is located off of the Strip just enough that it's not a hassle to get to. Sometimes it gets crowded but most of the time it's pretty livable. They even have a really cool drive thru, something you don't usually see at places that have the more kosher Mexican fare. There's a pretty good sized lot right next to it for a Denny's or something-or-other, you can usually park there too without really getting hassled. In the summer at night you can just drive thru and tailgate it in the parking lot next door, ahhh perfect weather...just beware of the riffraff and don't let anyone sneak up on you.  As far as the food, hey it's Tacos Mexico, just like all of the rest of the locations I've been to in the LA area. What is there to say other than it's good stuff, and not the commercialized, fake Mexican food that most people know so well. Even if you aren't hungry at all, you should stop in and get two or three tacos anyways, JUST BECAUSE!!!"}
{"text":"I got punished and paid the price for trying a burrito at a place best known for their tacos. It also kinda helps too if I did more researches on things to do and places to eat and avoid when I visit any city. \"I know, that is why we have Yelp!\"  This place is opened 24 hours and a drive-thru, which are the only positives. But my $6.00 \"so called\" super burrito wasn't what I was expected for a city best known for good food.   First of all, I love all my \"super burritos\" fat, juicy, and wrapped tightly in a aluminum foil. But my burrito from here was small and wrapped loosely. Therefore, all the key ingredients fell apart on me leaving a fat mess. The meat, beans, and rice were also dry. And the chips were stale.  I'm an old man and still play with my food. So I dissected my burrito and noticed, \"I got ripped off.\" The shop didn't give me any cheese, guacamole and sour cream. If I wanted those fillings in my super burrito, according to menu I have to pay extra. Now I got it.    I ended up throwing 3/4 of that burrito away and left just finishing my Sidral Mundet sparkling Apple drink, which was refreshing.  To find a decent \"super\" burrito in another city continues."}
{"text":"Got so sick to my stomach after having the carne asada fries here.  The place didn't exactly scream \"careful food prep\" when I walked in and I should have turned heel, but I decided to give it a go anyhow.  About an hour after I ate, I had a terrible stomach ache and spent about 10 minutes on the toilet.  I'm never going back."}
{"text":"Tacos Mexico has arrived in Phoenix! Without a doubt the best tacos and burritos in Phoenix. When you visit Tacos Mexico, you can expect the freshest, most flavorful Mexican food. The tacos here are so good. Simple yet delicious. I'm glad Tacos Mexico made the decision to open this restaurant. It's always good when an established business decides to locate in a new market. Tacos Mexico opened it's first restaurant in Los Angeles back in 1976! I remember frequenting the place way back 25 years ago. The food hasn't changed a bit! Come on down for a taste of Mexico that you will never forget."}
{"text":"I was craving street tacos so I went here. The tacos are literally only a dollar and change for each one. I ordered a couple carne asada tacos and a couple el pastor tacos with everything on them (cilantro, onions, etc). Delicious! We went through the drive thru and the cashier was nice but they only had one cashier so she'd forget little things and assist the people in the store instead of making sure we had everything. It was a busy day so I cant be too hard on her. I will say that Id definitely come back for more tacos here especially the Pastor :) Thank you!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through Skip and only got half the order. Left out an entire person's food so they had nothing to eat. Asked for 4 sets of plastic ware only to get none. When you are staying in a hotel and they can't manage a simple delivery order it leaves a lot to be downsides. The food we did get wasn't correct either. We ordered 4 fajitas 2 other street tacos and ended up with 6 of something entirely different. Nacho chips were stale."}
{"text":"I've never had this place before but I was cruising by late night and was very hungry so we decided to check it out... I got some chicken tacos and the green sauce was amazing I'll definitely be bookmarking this place for future reference"}
{"text":"Chicken tacos didnt taste like anything. The asada tacos were very fatty. The lengua were ok. We did order a quesadilla which was delicious. Place is open 24 hrs and is clean so thats a plus. But food didnt impress. Prices were fair."}
{"text":"Such great customer service!!! The cook forgot to put chicken in my quesadilla, but the woman working the cash register was super sweet and told us to keep the regular quesadilla. Really polite too! The quesadilla and tacos are so good and they stacked them with meat. Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic !  Get the al pastor burrito..it delicious   very generous portions.  Great quality meat, beans, cheese,& sauce.  Classic hole in the wall gem ."}
{"text":"The meat was cold. We had carne asada fries. My boyfriend and i thought it was okay. The jamaica juice was good!"}
{"text":"By far the worst Mexican food I've had, coupled with terrible customer service. I dined here on Saturday night at 1am... I guess technically Sunday at 1am.   I had an inkling for mexican tonight, but I was a little impatient on waiting long lines at El Gordos, or Pepe's, so I decided to try this place out tonight. (I drove by it and there were zero lines.) in retrospect, I should have taken that as a big hint.   I ordered a combo plate of carne asada tacos, with beans and rice, and a carne asada torta (to go)  The beans on the combo were ROTTEN. They were completely sour. (Plus they were served ice cold?  Why???)   Wanting to bring this to the attention of the cashier (A very unhelpful girl with a hair out up in a ponytail) and to avoid other customers from getting food poisoning, I tell her that the beans are ROTTEN. She just looks at me and says, \"Ok\"  I immediately realized that the torta I ordered to go has beans on it. I asked her if the beans that they put on my plate are from the same pot as the beans that came on my platter, and she affirms my suspicions.   I asked her if I could have my torta remade because of the rotten beans, and she seemed a little bothered by my preposterous request. But they go ahead and make it anyways.   Not once... at all... did I get an, \"I'm sorry\". She didn't even offer to replace my beans for more rice, nothing. She did absolutely NOTHING about this. No apology. No offer to replace them with something else. Not even a sarcastic, \"oops\". She was completely unhelpful and uncaring. I thought that she was at least gonna tell the cook, \"Hey the beans are bad, throw them away!\"   Nothing.   She simply said, \"make him a new torta,  no beans\" Every customer after me was being served from that same pot.... disguuuuuuuusting.   Needless to say, I'm not coming back, and I'm calling management in the morning. The reaction of the employee, the rotten food, and terrible service is gonna ensure me I don't come back to visit this place."}
{"text":"This place is so good! The carnitas tortas was incredible. Most places were closed but we were so lucky to find this place open (New Years day).Definitely worth it! Must come! My husband had a chicken quesadilla, my dad a lengua quesadilla and my mom the sopes. Nice, clean, delicious and inexpensive!"}
{"text":"Better tasting tacos here then in their Los Angeles County stores. Maybe it was the years or these cooks have a better cooking hand but everything was delicious.  Ordered two tacos de tripa (extra crispy of course) and two Al Pastor tacos. I also tried half a taquito and it was delicious.  Plenty of parking on either side of the store, staff was cool but seating isn't fluffy approved, kinda tight but I wiggled myself into a booth."}
{"text":"The service has always been really great to me, and the people that work there are genuinely amazing.   Their food is authentic, and that's why it can be pricy, in regards to import and that's why it's worth it.   Their three milk cake was so good. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Oscar is hot and a good chef.. 5 stars! Always my fave place for carne asade fries at 3 am drunk...: love it"}
{"text":"They roll the tacos like there fkn retarded, it's so obnoxious I been there more than 3 times and all 3 times the tacos were thrown in the plate like a mother fkn salad I'm so pissed right now are they fkn serious?? Ugh"}
{"text":"Was hungry late one night so stop by as we were driving by. Wish we didn't. Bad service from the start. We walked in. Couple workers saw us and didn't acknowledge us and kept talking to themselves. Fine...whatever! Just give us some tacos and we'll be on our way.  Taco meats were dried, no flavor and tortillas stale. 3 main points of a good tacos... 0/3! Simply Terrible! Would've been better off going to sleep hungry!"}
{"text":"The BEST taco shop around!!! Just get the tacos and you'll see. Carne asada street tacos are excellent. Also the shrimp ceviche is glorious... reminded me of being in Mexico."}
{"text":"God bless this place. Bad ambiance, bad location, and unsavory people.lurking outside sometimes, but the food is the best I've had in LV. The signs are all in Spanish, but they have pictures and the cashier we worked with spoke good English. Definite dive but worth it."}
{"text":"Delicious carne asada tacos. Packed with meat. Good salsa bar. Open 24 hours.  Bad thing = restaurant feels a bit filthy.."}
{"text":"Cheap good food.  You will leave with your side busted out.  One of my favorite dives when I visit Vegas.  Skip the Pink Taco and try this place.  The refried beans are to die for."}
{"text":"This part of Vegas has abundant generic chain restaurants...but few places with character. Although Tacos Mexico is part of a chain, it is soulfully grungy with old skool video games and a laid back vibe. This is the place to go for Mexican when the need strikes you."}
{"text":"GREEEEE-SEEEEEE, but tasty.    Skip the tacos and head straight for the tamales.  Ole."}
{"text":"Great authentic mexican tacos! The place is very tiny for the restaurant and a bit crowded sometimes but it's worth it for the food that you get! when I first checked this place out I went at least 5/6 times in a row that week! it's just really good! the people working there are very nice and welcoming and very considerate. I love it there, and it is my go to Mexican cuisine place. Mucho Burrito does not compare to this place, this place is so much better!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you take a chance on the unknown and you find a true love. This place is true love.  Show up with an open heart and a  desire for flavours beyond what you've had here in Calgary. No disrespect to the others, but this place is the best.  Best tacos in Calgary. Love is real!"}
{"text":"I have used this location on several occasions to get my late night hunger fix.  This place is out of the way from the strip but not that far is one would like to take it to go.  When I stay at the Rio or Palace Station the food is still hot by the time it gets to my room. Earlier this week I woke up a little homesick and a craving for \"comida authentica\" that any of the hotel restaurants or other chains would not be able to satiate.  I stopped by here and picked up at large cup of menudo.  It was awesome it came backed with bits of buche instead of tripe  which I found delightful.  I will definetely add that to my next recipe when I make it again. Is it the best taqueria I have ever gone too, maybe not, but its open 24hours and offers so damn good food."}
{"text":"Truly a great deal and some genuine taste... Recommend taking out as its a small place and gets messy"}
{"text":"The girl working the drive-through needs to get her shit together . Cause she doesn't know what she's doing at all . Bad service"}
{"text":"Food is expensive, but it is okay. Ordered asada and chicken tacos, nachos, and a quesadilla. The nachos were great. The quesadilla came with a plate of rice and beans. The rice as straight dried out. Im positive it was sitting in a pot under hot water to keep it warm. The chicken was also dried but that's how it usually is. The asada was normal nothing special."}
{"text":"After hitting on a man in a dress I realized that I had probably one too many to drink and need to sober up. So I ran from the Sahara to a little place that reminded me of home and grubbed out at Tacos Mexico. Thanks, guys. This place had fast service that hit the spot and allowed me to continue on back to my hotel."}
