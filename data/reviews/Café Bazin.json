{"text":"4.5 stars!  A place discovered by a friend.. and oh my gosh, the food is really good! I cannot help it and have to come to this place for lunch two times in a row while I am in Montreal for a short vacation...  Fish of the day is seabass - crunchy skin with soft fish meat perfectly cooked and well seasoned. The combination of the ingredient used ( like grape tomatos, grapes ...I think) gives this dish a light but flavourful taste.. very very good dish.. and for $20, wow!!!! The dish has a very well presentation too! Check out the pic.   Also tried the dish with tuna - tasted very light and goes quite well with the soft boil eggs.   Dessert, in total, tried 3 from their offer selections. boy oh joy , they are yummmmmmy!! Must try!! Not only they look great, but  tasted really really good. Out of the three cakes I tried (from my pic), the best one in my opinion would be the one with strawberry with a thin layer cake wrapped into a roll! So many flavour in that cake, it also has a hinted flavour that taste like earl grey( not exactly sure , just my guess )... They are ALL good, but if I have to rank them, it would pick this one as first, then the coffee flavour tart thingie (just so well balanced between the coffee flavour and some chocolate), and then the round strawberry mousse (this one looks really cool in terms of presentation).   Boy for sure I will visit this place again next time I am in Montreal! I really love this place! Oh forgot to mention, the service are excellent and decor are clean and modern!"}
{"text":"Confession time: I occasionally have moments of gastronomic Tourette's syndrome, when I eat something so good I involuntarily start swearing.  I had such a food moment in Café Bazin (apologies to those sitting at the counter next to me).    This is a small cafe near where I live, and I've walked past several times but never saw an open seat.  Tried my luck yesterday and there was an open spot at the counter.    I had the soup of the day, acorn squash, which triggered a few quiet f-bombs.  Amazing, rich, incredible depth of flavour.  Essence of squashiness.  Super happy fun time.    Also had the spinach quiche, which was almost as equally delicious.  Silky texture with wonderful crisp crust.    Portions are not large but the food is very rich so they are just right for lunch.  I was too full to try one of the beautiful desserts I saw on display but they looked amazing.    Service was slow, not in a bad way, but in a \"this is a nice French cafe so sit there and savour your experience\" kind of way.  Not a place to grab a quick bite but rather a place for a proper leisurely lunch.   Prices are reasonable given the quality of the food.    Best lunch I've had in Montreal in a long time.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Having been open a few weeks I decided to make the trek to try this bakery. Arrived at 3pm on a Saturday and almost all the deserts were sold out so the selection wasn't great, but what we did try was divine. The pistachio cream puff with a raspberry in the middle was amazing and a $1.50 is a steal.  We then tried a strawberry summer roll. A thin layer of cake with strawberry compote rolled into a sushi like presenatation with a fresh strawberry on top. So light and summery I loved it. We also tried the crème brûlée. This was standard, good but nothing different about it. We also had cappuccinos, but they seemed heavy on milk and was more of a small latté. Coffee was no strong either. I'll definitely be back to try other offerings."}
{"text":"Great brunch place with amazing service. Food is exceptionally executed with simple ingredients.  Desserts are the bomb! A must visit."}
{"text":"GET THE HOT CHOCOLATE. Now that i have your attention let's proceed, this cute cafe is nest'ed in westmount near vicpark. The decor is amazing (if you k ow me you k ow i love plants). The interior is nice and neat they also have a small terrace  with maybe 5-7 tables. Okay now back to the hot chocolate, it was rich,thick and creamy. I also had the ratatouille which was light, decadent and flavourful. I couldnt resist and finished it all with an amazing dessert (crunchy almond cake with raspberries infused cream) SO GOOD. They have a small menu but with the right menu items and a large dessert selection. Go there and thank me later."}
{"text":"Great cappuccino and granola, in addition to beautiful desserts are served here. Nice terrasse to people watch. A new addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"It is one of Chef Antonio's restaurants in Westmount, and unlike Lavanderia which is just next door, Cafe Bazin is offering lighter meals and have a café vibes. It's a really chic cafe and everything they offer looks so delicate. The cuisine is French style but the menu is quite unique and innovative. We tried their lemon pistachio étagé and tout choco, both were excellent, giving me a feeling that I am back to France again. Then we took Paris-Brest au foie gras (normally Paris-Brest is supposed to be sweet) and Boeuf Bourguignon with homemade pasta, which is very typically French, I love both dishes, but not the vegetable soup that my friend ordered, which tasted like Campbell mushroom cream.  I would say that the price is also quite high for a cafe lunch, but the quality is definitely guaranteed!"}
{"text":"It is a very nice restaurant. Decoration is simple. Food is absolutely nice. The beef is soft and taste good. The quiche is good but stuffy. The foie gras donut is great. The dessert is perfect. Definitely come back for it."}
