{"text":"Randomly decided to try something new yesterday and looked up middle eastern places in the area. Great location, excellent service and awesome food. 5 stars all the way. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, the chef even came out to ask how we were enjoying the meal. Once again, the service was excellent and it made you feel as if you we're invited over for a meal. A+++ will being going more often!"}
{"text":"One of the amazing restaurants you can visit in North America for authentic Middle Eastern fine dining experience. The food is simply phenomenal and beyond your expectations - even better than most of the restaurants IN the Middle East. The courteous owners saves no effort in accommodating you, smiling all the way, and making sure you are comfy. We went multiple times and tried the Mansaf, Bamiya Tajin and Maqloobeh. We are excited to try the rest of the items on the menu ... Levant - you are the reason we still believe in Middle Eastern cooking outside the home! Keep the good work"}
{"text":"Hidden away in the plaza in front of Vaughan Mills, our little group ventured out to try a new place, for some of us completely different. Well maybe not completely different as some dishes are similar to other middle eastern fare.   We let our more experienced friend with guidance of our waiter place the order, and were happy we did so, as we didn't know much about Moroccan cuisine. The meal started with pita chips with a dip. I don't know the dishes by name, but everything was great, the chicken was juicy and the quail was flavourful, the spicy dish wasn't overly spicy at all.  The dishes recommended by our friend and the waiter really complimented each other, with a beef dish, lamb, chicken and quail dishes and vegetable dishes and a full array of different levels of spice and flavour.   Our server was friendly and had a good grasp of the menu and the cuisine as a whole. He was able to answer all our questions and then some. He also had a good sense of humour, which really added to our experience.   I'm happy that we were able to get together with some good friends and have a wonderful Moroccan meal, and close to home, we'll definitely be coming back after we save up a little as the prices were a bit on the high side and the portions weren't as big as one would hope to match those prices."}
{"text":"Levant is a small, family restaurant specialized in serving ethnic Mediterranean Northeast African cuisine which includes countries of Algeria, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia.   A Northeast Africa theme restaurant is quite unique in the area and I was looking forward to visit since it opened as I really enjoy the flavour of Moroccan and Tunisian food.  We shared 2 appetizers and 3 mains:  Msa'aah - Toasted eggplants dipped with our signature tomato sauce stuffed with  seasoned ground beef ($7.99) - Cheese and more cheese.. bubbling hot..   Msakhan - Baked thin bread topped with onions saut√©ed in olive oil and our special sumac seasoning ($6.99) - Love the sumac seasoning, giving it a nice kick! The roast almond gave it extra texture  Chicken tagine  - Slow-roasted chicken breast mixed with chickpeas served with couscous ($18.99) - Chicken itself taste a little bland and tough. The sauce has a hint of spiciness but quite one dimensional - 4 small piece of chicken, a little overpriced   Ma'alobeh (upside down)  - Rice cooked with cauliflower and lamb served with cucumber salad ($19.99) - The lamb was tender but lack seasoning and the rice was cooked crispy with interesting crunch -  But seriously with just 1 piece of lamb, rice and cauliflower for $20!?!!   Freekeh - Seasoned quail served with freekeh and cucumber salad ($19.99) - I love quail, so this is the main course I enjoyed the most out of the main courses we ordered - Green wheat is quite interesting, remind me of barley. A really healthy option as  Freekeh has at least four times as much fibre as some other comparable grains and higher in protein compared to couscous and rice.  The food was A-OK but a little pricey as the portion is quite small. Dessert offerings though was a little disappointing: Tiramisu and Mango Cheesecake?! Oh I forgot I am in Vaughan....   Service here is helpful, friendly and attentive. The deco is simple but nice.   I left a little confused after eating at Levant Restaurant. I just felt like something was missing.. but I know I was still hungry and I was ready for another meal..."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  We came here on a Thursday evening and the restaurant was pretty empty. About 75% of the lights were on. After taking a look through the menu, we decided to order the hummus ($5.99) and the chicken tagine ($18.99). We asked for water, which came in a pitcher, which is great because we don't have to ask for refills!  We were offered an appetizer of some chips and dip. I forget what was in the dip, but it wasn't any of the things I thought were in it. It wasn't bad. I liked the hummus a lot. It was smooth and the bread was nice and crispy.  We ordered the chicken tagine with the couscous. The couscous was really good, as was the chicken tagine. However, we both noted that the chicken was a overcooked. I thought that the size was quite small for the price.  All in all, the food was okay. I wouldn't mind coming back, but had high hopes for the tagine. I'll have to try other dishes in the future."}
