{"text":"I have been coming to Oggi's for awhile now and I have always had great experiences!  There are never a lot of people there and the food is served up quick.  They make their own beer and have a decent IPA which is very HOPPY.  They also have HOP JUICE!   If you're on a budget, just ask for a \"sample\" of the hopjuice and they will give you one.  Whalla!  You just got a SHOT OF 14% beer for FREE.  Haha!  Anyway, the WINGS ARE THE BEST.  I get the killer wings and request them GRILLED.  I also love their pizza titled SLAM DUNK which is made with the WING SAUCE!!"}
{"text":"Contrary to some other reviews, I do like this place- For sports viewing and decent food! They have lots of TV's with all college and pro football games on, so its pretty easy to watch your out of town team (Oakland Raiders) on one of their screens. Salads are just OK, wings are great, and pizza is better than average. Went here recently for lunch, midweek, and the service was really lousy, like other reviewers had pointed out. But, this is a great place to watch a  game and have some munchies. They are Hockey-Friendly as well!"}
{"text":"OH GEE I'm sorry I ever came here. Then again, it could have been what I ordered--Pollo Pizzaola. I should have stuck to regular bar food, but I just wasn't in the mood for a burger, pizza or wings.   IF you decide to eat here just realize they have one type of sauce, pizza sauce and it's not that great. There are lot's of other places in the area with better food.   Please don't waste your  money eating here."}
{"text":"Don't even bother. The food served had no relation to the beautiful pictures on the menu. Plus the excuses we got for the inconsistancy were laughable. JR"}
{"text":"who knew the pizza place slash brewery i grew up with in my suburban californian shithole had a location in scottsdale? luckily i did.  good to know that no matter which location, oggi's seems to have everything completely consistant and they don't fuck around. yay for the freezer section? probably but i dont give a shit cause i'm not paying baller cash for this food anyways.  people who complain about places like this strike me as the kind who go to dennys and bitch about the food or the service. you should have a level of expectation when you eat at or order from a place like this. you're not ordering the duck confit or the wagyu filet, you're ordering an overcheesed pizza overloaded with toppings and a greasy fried appetizer. score.  this being the first time i consumed their food without multiple pitchers of draft beer, i'm pretty impressed. no harm, no fouls, good pizza."}
{"text":"There really isn't anything special about this place.  It was a default lunch location for people in my office, but in reality- it sucked.  I would end up not eating rather than going with everyone and eating there.  Everything I've had there was greasy- except the salads, which are so-so.  I'd rather eat at home than eat here."}
