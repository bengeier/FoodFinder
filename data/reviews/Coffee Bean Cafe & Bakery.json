{"text":"Great set up! Helpful staff and delicious vegetarian chili!"}
{"text":"I just ordered here today through grub hub. The salad was the beet one and it was great, the only negative is that on the site you are forced to order extra dressing in order to advance, so that's annoying. The salami and mozzarella sandwich was amazing. There was also a muffin, banana walnut and a cookie, both were awesome."}
{"text":"Love Coffee Bean Cafe! I had no idea it existed until I stumbled in on it during my lunch time walk, but now I'm a frequent visitor. Small but delicious menu, with healthy and vegetarian/vegan options. But for me, the biggest draw is the coffee. From where I work, I had thought the only walking distance coffee options available were from McDonald's (ick), so I was thrilled to find a conveniently located cafe with awesome coffee. The white mocha is my favorite drink, but you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Be sure to check it out if you find yourself in Midtown!"}
{"text":"A great cafe I've been loyal to ever since I started working nearby. I've only tried one of their beverages and never tried another because it was so amazing: the Honey Bee (\"Light and lovely combination of lavender and real honey mixed into steamed milk and espresso\"). Add one packet of Sweet & Lo and you're in BUSINESS with the Honey Bee. 

I've also sampled their salads and sandwiches and am never disappointed. As long as I work within walking distance of the Coffee Bean, I'll always be a repeat customer (I also send my clients here!)."}
{"text":"Great spot with good lunch options in comfortable space. Haven't tried the coffee or breakfast yet but the menu seems like great options are available. The space is open and inviting. Staff is friendly. The two times I've stopped in I've been very please with the lunch options I've ordered."}
{"text":"This is a great place with lots of seating. Sandwiches are very good and coffee drinks delicious. It is in a slow part of midtown so not much foot traffic. 

When I went for lunch today, I learned they were closing at end of the day. This is sad as it is a great place, not in such a great area of town. I will miss them"}
