{"text":"Decent diner but nothing special really. Perhaps it is a great diner with Montreal measures but, I don't think it's much to write home about."}
{"text":"Nothing great. Worst breakfast potatoes I ever had.  Bagel came a good 15 minutes before the rest of our meal.  Not the freshest bagel either.   Would not return.  There are much better breakfast places in  Montreal."}
{"text":"I worked around the block from Beauty's, so everyday I see the lineups piling out the door.  Had lunch there a few times and everything they do, they do very well.  Still, I find it puzzling there is consistently THAT many people looking to get in.  I guess it's kind of like Schwartz's - less about the food (which is good but not life-changing) and more about the institution of it all."}
{"text":"This was the perfect place for breakfast.  It was a relaxed local feeling diner.  The food was great and priced well.  Good coffee and good service.  It's really everything you would hope for from a diner.  All the staff are very nice and welcoming.  The bagel was amazing.  I live in Brooklyn, and I think that I have been converted to the Montreal bagel. It was delicious and I'm craving one right now just typing this."}
{"text":"All hype, no heart. Great service, food is good but If there is a line, go somewhere else.  We stepped into this Americana time bubble in the heart of the plateau and were greeted by Hymie, the legend himself. He makes sure people are seated as promptly as possible and oversees a well-oiled machine. As we wait, we read all the numerous articles depicting Beautys as a must Montreal attraction; we are overflowing with excitement like kids in line at the amusement park.The couple ahead of us said they came all the way from the West Island. \" Damn, this must be good\" I thought.  We ordered omelettes, french toast and some trademark smoothies.We were promptly served. To be perfectly candid, the food was ok, you can have this at any other breakfast place. Surprisingly, the bagels were really mediocre. The $6.5 smoothies are actually quite good and were the best part of the meal.   You can come and have a filling breakfast but there is no enlightenment here."}
{"text":"Make sure you come early, as there WILL be a line-up later. Beauty's is like an old-school diner, bar stools included. It's very cramped and claustrophobia-inducing since as the owner so eloquently stated \"every seat is money\".   We were promptly seated in a booth at the back, almost in the kitchen. This served as entertainment as well since you could clearly see how the servers and the cooks interact (and let me tell you, it. is. tense.)   We ordered a cookies and creme smoothie (never too early for one of these bad boys), french toast, and a Beauty's 2.   The smoothie was huge, don't expect to finish your breakfast after this. The french toast was a bit greasy and since it;s made with challah bread, it's pretty rich.  Beauty's 2 was huge: potatoes (not great), 2 eggs (any style), bacon (cripsy!), pancakes (meh), and a bagel (st. viateur?).   Service was decent. If you're looking for an old-school breakfast experience, check out Beauty's."}
{"text":"The pancakes were not overly sweet and even had a slight tinge of savouriness to them. I would attribute this to being cooked on a very well seasoned griddle that has seen the backside of eggs and bacon for decades. Like Chinese restaurants have the \"wok hei\" - the \"breath of the wok\" that constitutes the umami of a dish; in this context, I would call this Beauty's Jewish \"Oymami\"."}
{"text":"Restaurant à la réputation surfaite. Beaucoup de patates. Ce qui fait volumineux dans l'assiette. 14$+café+txs, et vous avez flambé votre 20$, de féculents. Servi courtois. Vite, vite on produit! Comment se fait-il que les touristes y accourent?"}
{"text":"The food was really good. I had a big diner breakfast, my husband had the incredible Club sandwich and my cousin had a smoothie.  It was a Sunday and relatively busy. Our server was a bit short with us, which wasn't awesome, but the food was good enough to earn a 4."}
{"text":"I went to Beauty's with a well-behaved toddler and they sat me in the back, which I didn't mind. After we ordered, they brought one plate, but  didn't bring my food (a special).    I tried to get their attention, and I was totally ignored.  It wasn't very busy, being 8:30am on a Sunday.    When I  finally caught my waitress and pointed out that I hadn't received my food, and she gave me a look when I asked for it to go!?    She charged me full price. I spoke to another waitress and she acknowledged seeing the bagel sitting there, and told me I should have spoken up... I tried!    In the end, I  ended up giving my breakfast to a homeless man.  I hope it was good, because I doubt I'll go back to Beauty's.  I really had hopes of adding it to my list of breakfast places."}
{"text":"Très bonne ambiance et très joli décor ! J'avais juste envie de goûter des pancakes au sirop d'erable et j'ai eu des pancakes au sirop d'erable!  Les choix sont variés et tout le monde est sympathique. Il ne faut pas s'attendre à des plats très élaborés mais il y a de tout : smoothie, pancakes, bagels, salades, burgers, omelette, et c'est bon !"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the nostalgia as that is all this place is. It's cute but not worth the price. At this point you can get lox and cream cheese or a shake anywhere. There's no need to go to Beauty's... take a picture and move on!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best bagel and lox (Beautys Special) I've ever had. Great atmosphere and great staff. My boyfriend and I also shared the mish mash, omelette with hotdogs and it was just as tasty. The staff were so friendly we came back to get some beautys special to go for our drive back home. All the staff we met were super friendly and if I'm back in Montreal this is a place I'll make sure to come back and visit."}
{"text":"Food was ok, however very basic - no fruit on the side, only a single side with most dishes. Not worth the queue, the place is clearly over hyped."}
{"text":"Cute, old-fashioned-lookin dinner. Kind staff. I had the hamburger : patty on the thin-side, cooked grey, yummy onion bread bun"}
{"text":"We didn't have to wait in line (which apparently is a normal occurrence here) and the service was good and fast! Everyone was very friendly and the Mac and cheese was to excellent! I would definitely recommend this place when visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"The first breakfast diner to open up in Montreal back in 1942 and it's definitely kept its charm! My friends and I all ordered the BBM, Beautys breakfast melt, my first time having a sandwich made with challah bread, and it did not disappoint. 10/10 would recommend for a hungry stomach"}
{"text":"The breakfast -bagels or otherwise- and smoothies are ok but definitely not worth waiting in a long line on the weekends. There are much better breakfast/brunch options in Montreal.  While the food might have been mind blowing 50 years ago, it's pretty average by today's standards. I feel like the place is just coasting on past glory."}
{"text":"The line on the weekend, with many locals, is a true sign that the word is out on Beauty's. What fun we had with our waiter and the visit to our table by Hymie the owner. A lovely gentleman who clearly loves his work. The Nova lox plate was a great way to start the day, and the omelettes were light without the grease of typical greasy spoons."}
{"text":"This is a Montreal iconic breakfast joint.  However it is only riding on its old reputation.  Went for breakfast with 3 other people and had an issue getting seated because one of our party hadn't arrived even it we would have been seated at the same booth.  Had the breakfast melt with bacon that was so dry it just crumbled in my sandwich.  The wait staff was nice but the old man making sure the tables are turning over is way to zealous.  Someone ordered a milk shake and had to make it to go because the wait staff said the old man would give her heck if we all stayed to drink it on site.  I wasn't a happy camper and will not be going back there."}
{"text":"L'endroit est vraiment bien, la déco est charmante. Les points positifs s'arrêtent là.  La nourriture est très moyenne, même pour un diner sans prétention. J'ai commandé un superbeautys, mes patates étaient dures (pas assez cuites), mes ufs trop liquides et sans goût, seul le bacon valait la peine. Pour 20$ avec un vulgaire café filtre, je m'attendais certainement à plus..."}
{"text":"I used to live very close to this place so I have been there several times and pass by it every day. This place is always packed and there is always a line up on the weekends. This is something I never understood because the food at this place is very ordinary. You will have the typical breakfast for a very inflated price. I ordered waffles once and it came to be on a plate with just the plain dry waffle, nothing else. That being said, I did enjoy the ambiance of this place."}
{"text":"Belgian waffles weren't too bad.  Salmon bagel looked good on the plate my friend ordered.  The walk over sucked when it was raining, but at least they serve an inviting warm caffe con leche.  Wallet was rather thin after the trip but our appetites were filled."}
{"text":"On a bien manger .... Mais je m attender à plus peut être car on m en avez parler en bien c est bon le service et bien mais rien d extra :) mais je recommande quand même"}
{"text":"Well... Nice friendly multiculture environment, fast service We came for brunch, i should say i have a certain expectation when i go somewhere for brunch. Very disappointed from pancake,lets say it mostly taste like vanila cake, only it's appereance was like pancake, overall everything else was good. Is that only me or they really calculate 15% or 18% tip on the bill!!!!!"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast food served in generous portions for a reasonable price! Waitresses were quick, friendly, hard working and accommodating. We couldn't help but laugh at the strange old man pointing patrons to their designated seats and muttering \"you're welcome\" even if nobody had addressed him. Not an essential fixture while traveling in Montreal, but a charming little place nonetheless, and a proper diner if it's on the way and you have a large appetite for breakfast food. I would recommend their signature \"Mish Mash\" omelette - especially as a hangover remedy!"}
{"text":"Nous avons été tres déçus de cette place qui n'a rien d'exceptionnel. La nourriture est très moyenne et servie tiède. Le service n'était pas particulièrement agréable."}
{"text":"Great dinner.  Just what you would want when thinking dinner breakfast.  Friendly, food was delicious, coffee fresh and service quick with a smile.  Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"A trip to Montreal is never complete until you visit Beautys. The ambience is great and the food is better. It nice to know that though things change some things only get better with time."}
{"text":"Went here for a late breakfast / lunch.  Very relaxing, authentic vintage diner environment.  Being greeted as you walk in by the (octogenarian?) owner was a plus!  Food highlights: banana pancakes, spicy turkey burger (on a good bun), and coleslaw were very good.  For diner food (and I don't mean that in a negative sense), above average.  HOWEVER - we walked right in (it was a Friday mid-day).  I do not think this is worth a 40 minute+ wait on a line . . . . but we go to diners / Jewish delis a decent amount (we are from the NYC area).  If this will potentially be your only exposure to this sort of dining experience I guess a wait would be justified."}
{"text":"Been going to Beautys for years.  Great, reliable, delicious.  Get the Superbeautys 2."}
{"text":"What a mistake, waist of money and time.the food is average and the place is so old and dirty, they don't care about the clients they just sell their name that's why this place has never been renovates:("}
{"text":"Always good SuperBeautys 2, bleu smoothies, and the best rice pudding ever!!!!"}
{"text":"3.5, but rounded up to 4 due to Yelp's scale.... just as well since this place is a Montreal institution.  So, 4 it is!  All in all, a pretty solid breakfast spot.  It really is pretty basic.... just your typical, family run diner.  But, it does seem to be a dying breed nowadays, so I understand why people might rave about it.  The staff is pretty friendly, and the prices are pretty decent for the area.  If you get a chance to stop by, do so.  If not, it's not really worth a special trip.  Recommend."}
{"text":"Someone recommended Beauty's as the place to go for breakfast in Montreal. It was close to where we were staying, so why not. It was a weekday morning, so no crowds, but sufficiently populated. The service was fast and pleasant enough, but I don't understand the hype about the food. My husband had the challah French toast , whichwas tasty. I had a mushroom omelet that tasted fine, but nothing special. I had no choice of bagel, and the default is sesame.  It was probably the most bland tasting bagel I had ever eaten aside from supermarket bagels. Another thing, if you're a tea drinker, get your tea elsewhere either before or after your meal. The tea is horrible. That was just about it for me. Next time I'll go to one of the many other restaurants on Avenue Mont-Royal."}
{"text":"I found myself on the plateau in that time zone when it's too late for lunch but too early for something heavy as it might spoil dinner, when I stumbled across this little diner which by the looks of it has been around for quite some time!  Just needed a little boost for the rest of the afternoon and after perusing the menu and debating an all day breakfast or a burger, I landed on a classic. BLT on rye.   Well let me tell you, this was by far the BEST BLT I've ever had!!! 3 layers of juicy ripe tomatoes, stack of bacon and crisp layer (about 1 inch) lettuce. Just the right amount of mayo and level of crispyness, I found myself in BLT heaven!!!  Service was prompt and courteous and for $5, can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"Beauty's has great historical significance as it is one of the oldest restaurants in Montreal - they've been operating since 1942.   However I'd argue that that isn't by itself a reason to go as a lot of newer places have sprung up since then, as a lot of newer places have sprung up in the area offering a much better experience.  I had their much-hyped lox and while it was good it didn't particularly blow my mind. Beauty's may be worth a visit just for their reputation, especially if you spend a lot of time in Montreal, but if you have just a limited time, I would skip Beauty's and check out another of the Plateau's numerous options for brunch."}
{"text":"Great little diner in Mont Royal!  Just quick walk from Mont Royal park.  My SO and I arrived just before 10am on a Saturday and we were seated right away.  Service was quick and friendly.  I ordered the vegetable omelete with broccoli, cauliflower, red peppers and gooey cheddar cheese.  It was a big serving with lots of home fries as an accompaniment.  The omelete was delicious, not overtly greasy and generous portion.  My dish came with a good old Montreal bagel.  Coffee was ok.  My SO ordered the Beautys special - its a smoked salmon and cream cheese bagel with red onion.  He described it as simple yet very delicious.    Price - above average, it was just under $40 with tip for the both of us.  It gets busy after 11:30am - there was a line-up after we finished up breakfast.  I would definitely recommend Beautys if you are in Montreal."}
{"text":"Great Canadian breakfast, but very busy. Come early for a good seat, otherwise expect to wait and hour or more or sit at the bar when it's available."}
{"text":"Très bon spot pour le brunch! Enfin un diner qui sert des petit-déjeuners à l'américaine, sans que la taille de la portion soit déraisonnable! Les ufs sont parfaits et le bacon est bien crispy :) la seule fois que j'ai presque réussi à terminer mon assiette... Sauf pour le bagel!! Go."}
{"text":"Got the beauty special 2. So much food and very reasonably priced! The food was delicious, the line outside looked long but moved very quickly. No complaints and would definitely recommend for a hearty breakfast. Prepare to feel full all day long and maybe have some time to take a nap after :)(you'll need it!). Awesome place!"}
{"text":"Ordered the tuna melt, it was all cold, not warm at all. The prices are expensive and not much of a selection to drink."}
{"text":"Went here for Thursday brunch. Of course we had to line up. We had a 15 min wait which we expected. The diner was busy and service was great. Our waitress was cheerful and made sure to check up on us. Service was slow but it's probably because the place was packed.  I was with a group of 8. I ordered mac and cheese. Came with a green salad and balsamic vinaigrette. I wasn't impressed with the mac and cheese. While it looked better than Kraft Dinner, it tasted very similar. It had bread crumbs on top which was great but the mac and cheese itself was not impressive. Not worth the $14. The serving was big to get me full but taste wasn't great.   My friends ordered pancakes. They seemed OK. It looked like the food overall was OK. The atmosphere was nice however. Lots of families or friends catching up.   4/5 for service and atmosphere. 2/5 for food."}
{"text":"Really great breakfast spot. Love the nostalgia feel here. The owner of the restaurant sits in the same seat everyday and keeps an eye on things. The service, good, and atmosphere are all top notch. Instead of toast you get a famous bagel. I had the Beauty Special - 2 eggs, meat, and potatoes plus a side of lox for the bagel."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this weekend whenever I'm in Montreal since the eighties. Today a waiter was clearly trying to rush my friends and I from our table. We hadn't been in the restaurant for a long time. In fact there was another party of four who were seated before we were and they were still there after we left. I was introducing some of my friends to this restaurant and I was embarrassed by the waiters behaviour. I won't be back and the food was only do so, burnt hash brown and overdone eggs."}
{"text":"Be ready to wait in line for a well-liked  Montreal brunch spot. Beautys is an OG, with a charming owner who keeps his cool despite the hustle and bustle going on inside. The menu is large, the classic smoothies are larger, and I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Beautys est un endroit d'enfance pour moi, un souvenir.   Mon père m'y emmenait déjeûner alors que j'étais toute jeune. Si je peux me rappeler d'un seul truc, ce sont la qualité des bagels au saumon fumé, sans compter leur délicieux fromage a la crème !  J'ai bien hâte d'y retourner et de me replonger dans le temps."}
{"text":"One of the few old time breakfast places left.  Not for the health freaks but amazing greasy spoon!"}
{"text":"this time around, i have to say i enjoyed Beautys Much more. The french toast is a must get! so big, filling, fluffy, and comes with breakfast potatoes. this meal hit the spot for sure. i highly suggest coming before 1030 am, both times ive been here i got here just in time before the line to get in picked up outside. the servers and management will try their best to give you a seat promptly."}
{"text":"It's usually crowded and it appears to be a younger, hipster crowd.  Yet it's a friendly place with solid food and the patriarch still seems to be involved in front of house and greets you when you enter.  The Beauty's Bonjour breakfast bagel sandwich reminded me of the best bagel sandwiches that I ate while working in Montreal a number of years ago while the Beauty Breakfast melt on grilled challah is the sandwich I wish I had also found all those years ago.  The macaroni & cheese was under-salted and average at best so I wouldn't order that again and a number of menu items including omelettes appeared to be quite expensive but it's a cool retro (non-ironic) diner and I look forward to visiting Beauty's Luncheonette again."}
{"text":"Euh... non merci! J'ai testé, j'ai vu, j'ai gouté, j'ai... pas apprécié! J'avais une bonne impression de départ, un bon sentiment, mais j'ai déchanté lorsque les plats sont arrivés (enfin je parle des \"bons\" plats\", car j'ai eu droit à différents plats qui n'étaient pas les miens... certes, les serveurs avaient l'air débordé dans cet espace tout serré). Bref, je disais que j'ai vite déchanté quand les plats sont arrivés; mon amie également en face de moi. Rien du tout d'exceptionnel! L'impression d'être dans un brunch fast-food. La cuisine n'a rien d'un délice. Je ne conseillerais jamais à quelqu'un d'aller à cette place pour gouter un brunch nord-américain. La serveuse nous a mis dehors étant donné qu'il y avait de l'attente alors que je tiens à préciser que nous n'avions pas dépassé l'heure! ça faisait à peine une heure qu'on était assise qu'on devait déjà quitter les lieux. En sortant , on s'est dit avec mon amie et avec synchronisation \"plus jamais\"!"}
{"text":"Waiting in line for breakfast is like morning radio, its annoying and makes you wanna punch things. It's not 1942 anymore Beauty's get over yourself.  An overpriced standard breakfast.  2 stars for having to wait in line and 1 \"special\" star for those idiots out there who have stood there more than once, your done Beauty's."}
{"text":"This place is deeeeelicious!  Saw it on the food network, so just had to pay it a visit on my first trip to Montreal. As we approached we saw the longggg line and were slightly intimidated, but realized it must be good if so many people are waiting!   My friend and I hopped on line and within a few minutes the sweetest old man came out to welcome us us, and find out which parties were large and which were small.  As we got closer to the front we realized he's the owner! How cool is it to have the owner welcoming you?!   They have a policy where they like the fill the table, so if you're a table of 2 and the people behind you are a table of   5, if a booth that seats 5 opens up they're going to get seated first! The line moves pretty quickly though and everyone on line starts chatting after a while so it's no biggie.   When we were seated we ordered the the most popular dishes, the Beauty's Special (freshly made poppy seed bagel with cream cheese, lox, tomato and onion) and the Mish mash omelette (egg, carmelized onion, pepper, hot dog and sausage; with a side of home fries and a freshly made bagel). It was sooooooo delicious! Totally worth the wait and then some!"}
{"text":"Yummy! I love this place. Adorable little place with good food. The owner greats you at the door and he is super nice and happy to chat with you. We had the bagels with the lox, tomato and onion and enjoyed it very much. Had a classic smoothie (strawberry and banana and OJ), fresh and delish!"}
{"text":"Always been and always will be Montreal's best breakfast place. Since 1942, this place is always #1. Try Beauty's Special."}
{"text":"Beautys is a restaurant I've always wanted to go .... but oh my .... what a deception .  First we were greeted with a hand gesture telling us to wait at the door . Then , when we ordered the waitress was so impatient that she could had forgotten half of it . She had some trouble understanding how we wanted our eggs and made it clear that she was going to treat us like idiots for the rest of the lunch.  The food was ok . Nothing spectacular for a brunch. 15 dollars for a sandwich and a side of potatoes that were cold.  We politely asked for more water and the waiter pulled out a very unkind face and never came .  And finally when we were about to leave ( we only stayed there for 30 minutes) , the man who was cleaning the tables just threw a bucket full of dirty dishes in front of our face in order to clean up our stuff .  There were 10 people in the dinner and the service was horrible .  Don't waste your time waiting in line."}
{"text":"We finally made it to Beauty's for breakfast on our last trip to Montreal. Beauty was there in the flesh to greet us when we came in, which is pretty cool.   It was a January morning so very cold and we were happy to see that we wouldn't need to wait in line (though when we were leaving they were getting busier there was still no line.)  It's not that the food isn't good, because it is. The service is very fast, though, and that's probably why the turnover is fast enough to keep people off the streets. We were seen almost immediately and brought hot coffee, which wasn't anything fancy but it was good.   I decided to have the latkes with sour cream and apple sauce and he had the Mish-Mash, because when there's a trademarked omelette on the menu, it's called the Mish-Mash and it has hot dogs in it SOMEBODY has to order it.   Our food was up very quickly. My latkes didn't come with anything beyond the condiments (which is fine since they're $6!) and the Mish-Mash came with a toasted sesame bagel and home fries. Everything was very good (hot dogs and salami in an omelette - who knew?) and everything together after tax and tip came in at under $30. This is a way more reasonable standard breakfast than the fancier meals we've had on previous visits and one we plan to repeat!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. Definitely worth the wait. Had the French Toast and it was delicious.  Service was outstanding.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Diner très sympa qui vous replonge dans l'ambiance des 50's à l'americaine, le service est rapide et les portions gigantesques pour un prix plus correct. Apparement cet établissement est une institution à Montreal vu les clients viennent se faire prendre en photo avec le gérant.  // Very nice diner which will take you back to the american 50's era. Staff is quick and size of the meals is huge for a good price! looks like this place is very famous in Montreal since customers are coming just to have their picture taken with the owner."}
{"text":"Beauty's is an incredibly charming diner with a lot of history. It was one of the stops along the \"Beyond The Bagel\" food tour we went on but we only passed by so we decided to come back for brunch. It did not disappoint! The owner was sitting by the door greeting customers which was charming in and of itself but the food was really delicious.   We wanted to try the two specialties: bagel with lox and cream cheese and the mish-mash omelette with sausage, hot dog and green peppers. Both dishes were incredible! I was hesitant to try the omelette since I would never think to put hot dogs and eggs together but wow, it was so good. The home fries were really yummy too; I loved that they were light and flat rather than just potato chunks.   I wish I could come here for breakfast every week and would suggest it to anyone who loves the atmosphere of diners and/or GOOD FOOD."}
{"text":"There is a real life couple behind this Montreal staple, meet Hymnie and Freda. When they decided to open this diner in the city's Jewish district, I bet they didn't expect line-ups of hungry loud mouthed Montreal Canadienne fans, hung-over visiting Torontonian undergrads, UGG wearing yuppies and their Burberry scarf donning boyfriends, or me and my leather-jacket clad entourage of Asians. But alas, they did.  The longetivity of this eatery is likely rooted in the excellent food and casual atmosphere.  I love their waffles and mac n cheese. Not together, that's just gross. A little FYI, I wouldn't get the bagel and lox platter because it's overpriced.   The line-up is usually the only reason I may skip it.  On days I can deal, I'll endure the wait, especially if I want waffles first thing in the morning...afternoon...depending on what I did the night before."}
{"text":"Had a basic breakfast with coffee, it wasn't greasy which I like and the coffee was good as well. The service was nice. It's good when you're in a mood for a solid diner-type place without the grease."}
{"text":"With Beauty's being the Montreal landmark it is, I had high expectations for this place. That were not met.  I got the Beauty's special, which is a bagel with lox, cream cheese, onions and tomatoes (you can opt to forgo the onions if you wish, but I wouldn't recommend that). It was okay, maybe even pretty good, but not $11 good. I've had better for cheaper at numerous places in the city.   One of my friends got blueberry pancakes, which were okay but you have to pay extra for maple syrup. We are in Quebec! That is not acceptable.   Another one of my friends got a plate of eggs, potatoes, and bacon. I don't even know how they could have cooked the potatoes that badly. They were not quite burnt, but very hard and about a quarter of the portion was inedible.  It wasn't too busy when I went as a group of 4 - a Friday (non-holiday) around 11 and there was no line. Not worth it. It's a cute diner, and the service is friendly, but it's not just overhyped. It's just ... bad (or at least my one experience was)."}
{"text":"Great diner on Mont Royal Street Classic Canadian bagels with salmon Excellent value on quaint neighborhood"}
{"text":"Been going here for over 30 years every time we visit Montreal we go at least once.  Favourite is the beautys bonjour"}
{"text":"Une petite déception. Une malchance peut-être?  Plusieurs personnes m'avaient déjà parlé des déjeuners du Beauty's, un restaurant vraisemblablement bien apprécié par la plupart des gens... J'avais donc bien hâte d'y aller.   En entrant, l'ambiance du restaurant est correcte. Le personnel n'est pas très souriant en général; tout le monde a l'air blasé... Sauf notre serveuse qui est très professionnelle et sympathique.   Côté menu, plusieurs choix s'offrent à nous. J'ai pour ma part choisi un plat bien simple, des oeufs avec des pommes de terre, etc. Mon assiette est arrivée terriblement froide et mon cappuccino n'était malheureusement pas très bon. Mon bagel était tellement dur que je n'ai pas pu le manger! Pour finir, nous avons dû attendre un bon 20 minutes après avoir fini de manger pour avoir notre facture et un petit moment pour payer ensuite.   J'y retournerai probablement pour voir si ma première expérience doit être mise sur le compte d'une malchance, car j'ai dû mal à croire que je suis la seule qui n'a pas trop apprécié sa visite au Beauty's."}
{"text":"Ambience is fun. Food is mediocre. The worst was the attitude of the people working there, which seems to reflect management's policy. 20 minutes into our brunch, they started trying to kick us out - while we were still eating! I understand people were waiting, but with this is not why we go out to eat. I am not going back and will make sure to tell my friends not to either...."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Would definately go back. Great food and atmosphere! Reasonable prices too!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went to Beauty's and after reading the yelp reviews were excited about this place.   We went during the week and just after the big storm so we found the place to be quiet which was a nice surprize because I've heard the line ups are long.  We were not to be disappointed.  The service was friendly and quick.  Moreover, the food-the pancakes and the challah bread were excellent.  The coffee was filled up regularly too.  Bonus.  Would go again and again."}
{"text":"Breakfast is great, and the service is excellent! The menu is a classic diner menu, but most items are served with fresh bagels. A great go-to for when you dont want anything too fancy. The staff is super friendly and the intorior of the restaurant is charming."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty breakfast. Mish mash omelete is good, try also the potato latkes which are not bad.  very friendly staff. A bit overpriced tho. 45$ for two is bit too much for the place I think. To be done at least once."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not worth lining up for.   Good smoked salmon bagel, but you can get that anywhere.   Ok Mish mash, way too overcooked.   Ok home fries, it was cooked and then diced.   Bad cafe au lait   \"Eat the legend: eggs scrambled with salami and onions, triple-decker sandwiches, Beauty's special with Montreal bagel and lox, the best banana bread.\""}
{"text":"Very good brunch spot, waited 20 mins for a table, server was great, food was amazing try the bagel w lox!"}
{"text":"More of a novelty than anything else. Despite that the food is decent and yes the owner still hangs out there after all these years."}
{"text":"Beauty's has been around since 1945 and you certainly get that retro vibe the moment you walk in.   The service was fast and efficient. I had the Beauty's special #2 breakfast. Loved their pancakes! They had a dense texture which absorbed the maple syrup so well!! Ask for the bagel instead of toast. It's delicious!!   Along with their freshly squeezed orange juice, they had bagels and lox which seemed to be very popular items with the locals. Decent portion size as well!!   Get here early because the line ups for breakfast / brunch are long.   I'm going to make this a go to spot whenever I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Can we get a resounding OOVERAATEEED over here?  Not worth lining up for. There are tons of other delicious breakfast places, OR! A grocery store across the street where you can get crazy things like eggs and bacon!  The only thing that is worthy there are their smoothies. The rest, meh.  The last time I went the potatoes were super undercooked/half fried. Like still hard, raw potato undercooked.   I love me a greasy spoon diner place, look up bons on broadway in vancouver for my standards. But if you can't make the simple things good, what's the point?  Although a place is considered an institution, everything can't stay the same for forever.   They've either had troubles hiring good staff or are overwhelmed. Either way, don't stress yourself over it."}
{"text":"Mon copain et moi adorons le Beauty's. Endroit simple et très sympathique de style \"diner\" des années 70-80, vive les banquettes et les milkhakes!!  Des crêpes américaines épaisses et toutes fluffy... Et du vrai sirop :)  Essayez leurs différents milkshakes fruités et colorés! Mais si vous y allez la fds, attendez-vous à un pas pire line-up!"}
{"text":"ESSENTIAL diner food in Mont-Royal. Lots of history here, and a fantastic Montreal bagel (it is a thing) and lox for breakfast. If you looove diners, you gotta go to Beautys."}
{"text":"Beauty's is awesome.  There was a decent line out front which went quickly.  The atmosphere is great, as it looks like not much has changed over the last few decades.  The OJ is fresh squeezed and delicious, and the breakfast was simple, and well prepared.  The bagel was awesome!  Our server was excellent as well.  I'll definitely be visiting here on my next trip to Montreal and recommend this to anyone looking for a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"Poor service, horribly long wait, overpriced diner food.  Went there, had the waitress with the grey ponytail.  She brought out the coffee and food, then did not come back to refill the coffee once.  She brought us the check when we were finished.    Here's where it gets interesting: The bill came to around $18.50.  I get out a $20 bill, and when she comes to collect the money, I tell her to keep the change, and I was planning on taking out extra money to leave more tip.  She thought that the change I told her to keep was the only tip, and gets angry.  She tells me with an attitude, \"the tip is 20%, not 15%,\" circles the suggested tip amount shown on the bill, and walks away.    ha. hahahahaha.  Silly lady, never ever tell someone how much to tip you.  ESPECIALLY considering the service was poor to begin with.  So I walked out with my change and she got NO tip."}
{"text":"They sell these really cute edgy hipster hats. I was very tempted to buy one of them but I feel like it would be somewhat similar to the food - looks good and makes for the perfect Instagram, but at the end of the day you can probably find something better closer to home.  The food is alright, but not worth waiting in line for (luckily, there was no lineup when I went!)"}
{"text":"Wanting one last typically north American brunch, we stopped at raved-about Beautys. We arrived just before lunch rush and were therefore seated right away by a fiery old man which we later learned was the owner. The decor of the place takes you back to the 50's, so does the menu; the rushed and stressed atmosphere and the prices on said menu reminds you you're definitely in 2014. We had the superbeauty2 (eggs, pancakes, sausages, bacon and potatoes) with a fresh orange juice and the Nova omelette (salmon, pepper and onions) with bagels and a chocolate milkshake. The food had nothing wow about it. It's all very comfy and easy, nothing you couldn't make yourself in your kitchen even without any cooking talent. But you have the pleasure of it being done for you as if like us you just didn't feel like cooking this morning. The orange juice was good and fresh as announced (it's so rarely the case I had to point it out) and the milkshake was just delicious. Do not expect to be able to take your time and enjoy your brunch, this is a place where you come, eat and go (and pay), no time to waste."}
{"text":"Good option for brunch on the best diner style. Went after a run at montroyal and liked the ambiance and food."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. It doesn't have the fancy food of some of the other brunch spots in town, but it is GOOD. I came in alone on a Saturday morning before 9:00 to make sure I beat the brunch rush. Things were starting to get busy by the time I left an hour later, but there were still open seats at the counter, where I sat. I had some of the best, friendliest service I've had in Montréal, and watched the staff be equally welcoming to other customers. I went for the plate of pancakes, eggs, homefries, bacon, and sausages (also came with a bagel). Much more food than I needed, but I wanted to try it all. Everything was tasty and well-prepared (and I brought the leftovers home). I also bought one of their mugs as a souvenir, and intend to come back on as many of my remaining weekends in Montréal as possible! That the owner, who started the place in 1942, still runs it and sits at the counter is an extra bonus. I think this is a really special place, and I'd recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"There is nothing wrong with Beauty's. It is good solid breakfast fare. Nothing fancy. No frills.   They churn their own ice cream but when I went they were not churning, since it was a week day.   Nothing I ate here was out of the ordinary. Really, it was all food that I could have made myself in my own kitchen, except I was eating it in Beauty's in a diner booth with friends.   I realize that this place is an institution and famous landmark of the city, but maybe it was overhyped when I went and thus I felt let down. I am not really sure what I was expecting. Maybe something exciting like a pin-up waitress on a roller skate and a delightful interaction with a charismatic mom/pop type of thing.   Whatever half-baked imaginary picture I had in my head was not there and I was left sort of bored poking at my egg wishing I could have their ice cream that was unavailable."}
{"text":"We figured this must be a great restaurant to have breakfast and it turn out one of the worst we ever had. I ordered s simple sausage and egg. The sausage was dry and the potatoes were hard. My wife ordered the egg white with cheese omelette and it was cold because they dump the cold cheese on the omelette and served. There beauty special was a joke. 3 small pieces of smoke salmon with cream cheese on a bagel for $12.95. I don't even know how they get a good rating here. We will never come again. Also they put 18% tip on our bill without asking!!!"}
{"text":"Montreal delicious breakfast spot. The grilled salami was perfect and always my preferred breakfast meat. Had the seasame bagel (delicious) with nova, tomato, and cream cheese. Must have early morning snack and great area to walk around after to work it off. Will be again"}
{"text":"Oh goodness, that omelette. Dare I say the best omelette I've ever eaten? I'll say it. Whoa.  We went on a weekday mid-morning and so did not have the (apparently classic) Beauty's line experience. I'm cool with that.  Many meals, large and small, decently priced. I'd say diner with a few fancypants twists.  Fantastic service! Really good coffee."}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast place in Montreal. Bacon was out of this world along with the hot chocolate. Service was genuine and prompt. A very special place to take the family."}
{"text":"This was the first place I ate at when arriving to Montreal!!! Wow! The restaurant has an old school diner feel, and I believe the original owner still works here to seat the guests!  The omelette I had here was the best I've had! It is a very busy place so if you're a big group it may be challenging to get a table but definitely worth trying if you've never been. i will be coming back for sure!  Food -  Great Service - Friendly and quick Ambiance - Old school diner Worth the money - Yes!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Very good diner food.  It was nice to see the owners there too!  Better if you have a small group.  We had two people and got seated after only like 10 minutes on a Sunday morning.  I also got the chocolate chip bannana cake to go, very delish!"}
{"text":"Fancy? No. Delicious? Oh YES!  This place has been around for a gazillion years. My dad went here as a teen. I went here when I was a teen. I recently brought my teen kids here on our last visit to Montreal. It was exactly, EXACTLY as I remember it: line of folks waiting to get in, fuddy duddy non-descript décor with vinyl booths and linoleum everywhere, Hymie at the front door trying to get lingerers to vacate their tables, the counter, the Beauty's merchandise for sale at the cash up front, the posted photos of staff in their travels, the dinky booths in the back by the toilets (no one wants to sit there, for good reason! They're right by the toilets! It's also quite dim and dingy back in the restaurant here, without the benefit of natural light from the windows), and the knowledge that you could return in another 50 years and the place would look exactly the same.   The food is hit or miss, but their bagels with cream cheese will always be the cornerstone of their menu, for good reason. It's exactly what I miss, living now in Seattle: perfect Montreal bagels with the best cream cheese with lox and onions and tomatoes. To me, this is the perfect meal! Seriously, it's wonderful.   The sandwiches here are made with challah bread, as is the toast, so need I tell you, it's all delicious.    The service can be great or not so great, depending on your luck of servers. On our most recent visit, we had a lady who was hesitant to give me change for the meter (there's only meter parking outside on the street), despite my having the currency bills. I didn't understand her reluctance; she said we should pay with my credit card. She acted like I was really putting her out. What gives?  The price of food is somewhat high, but to me, it's worth it for the taste of tradition and my beloved Beauty's bagels!"}
{"text":"We all really loved our breakfast here! The food and milkshakes were yummy, and  the ambiance was great! Only slight downside were the portion sizes but i still consider it a 5*!"}
{"text":"Get there early + with small table sizes, and the wait won't be too much of a problem. Everything there was pretty solid, especially the bacon which was fried perfectly. The pancakes were also awesome"}
{"text":"It's a good breakfast but it's depending on its reputation way to much. What kind of breakfast place charges you extra for filter coffee?  This place is filled with tourists, if you want something just as good, half the cost, and way cooler, head East deeper in the plateau!"}
{"text":"So worth the line up wait. This place has not changed for the past 35 years. The same friendly waiters and the owner is always in for a chat. Food is awesome. Try their smoothies, it's so big they will ask you if you want to share"}
{"text":"Great ambience, good food. The salmon bagel sandwich is very tasty, although i wish it could have more salmon and less tomatoes =p little bit over priced but it worth for the tradition."}
{"text":"Do NOT leave here without buying a Chocolate Milkshake.  More on that later. If you're in Montreal, stopping for a meal at Beauty's is a must. Even Anthony Bourdain on No Reservations says so. Sure, it's diner food, but there's an inexplicable charm about watching this ridiculously old man seat people, and then seeing a 60+ year old photo on the counter of a young boy doing the same thing and realizing, \"OMG THAT'S HIM. That's the owner!\"  Does it offer anything revolutionary and different? No. What Beauty's does offer is standard diner food done RIGHT. Quite simply, it tastes good! Everything comes hot, tastes fresh, and when you're done eating, you realize you are completely satisfied. As standard diner etiquette goes, the waitresses are not particularly nice, but rather all business. The bagels you get with your meal are all right, but nothing special. Just a nice touch.  Beauty's offers fruit smoothies that are pretty good, but the main star of their beverage world is definitely the milkshake. I brilliantly ordered a chocolate milkshake, which turned out to be the best decision I made that day. It was phenomenal. I've never even used the word 'phenomenal' before, but that's what it was. Chocolaty, sweet, and too easily drinkable (this is NOT a thick milkshake, if that's what you're after), it was definitely the highlight of my meal. I had to cut off my mooching friend from stealing any more.   Don't come too hungry, but rather expect to wait on a line that goes out the door and wraps around the corner.  And don't forget to take some free souvenir post cards on the way out! ..At least I hope those were free.. hmm."}
{"text":"Great coffee (light& smooth). I shared the BLINTZES and the beauty's special (smoked salmon on a sesame bagel with cream cheese, onion and tomato). The salmon was very good one of the best I've had. The ratio of ingredients were well balanced and tasted great on a Montreal bagel.   The BLINTZES were creamy and lightly sweetened. The fruit wasn't the best but I visited in the dead of winter so it's not exactly the season for fruit."}
{"text":"Beauty's is a pretty cool little restaurant. We decided to walk down for breakfast right before checking out a huge park nearby. We didn't eat a lot since we'd be walking for the next 2 hours but what we did have was really good.  Mr. Sckolnick greated us at the door and we got a table for two pretty quickly. The whole place definitely had that welcoming old school diner feel to it. We got an egg, bacon and tomato sandwich on challah which hit the spot. We also tried one of their bagels which I believe they make there and was great."}
{"text":"Beauty's is like the Times square of Montreal brunch. It's overpriced, tourists love it, but anyone who lives here will tell you to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great little spot for whatever. I had the beautys special, bagel with smoked salmon, cream cheese, tomatoes and onions. It was delicious. Also grabbed some rice pudding.   As for the bagel debate, the two styles are different so it's hard to compare. I much prefer the NYC style of bagel, but the ones from Montreal are still worth eating.  Also get a mixed drink, they bring it out all separate so you can mix it up at the bar or your table. Also sit at the bar if you have a small party of people, you get an up close and personal experience with the wait staff and the kitchen staff"}
{"text":"A wonderful place for breakfast!  My partner and I were in Montreal for the weekend and looked for a memorable place to have breakfast on Sunday morning.  We found it in Beauty's.  The food is a bit more inspired than the usual diner fare, and cooked much better than your run-of-the-mill diner.  Cooked with care and very fresh tasting.  Nothing greasy about this place.  The service was outstanding.  Our waitress was so calm and friendly;  she really stood out in a place that could have been frenetic because of the full tables and long line, but instead she treated us as if we were the only people in the place.  This made us feel really at home and we relaxed into our breakfast.  And the owner!  He's 92 years old, still greeting people, still making sure everyone's happy.  It was a real pleasure to meet him. If I were you, I'd go, just to get the chance to meet this person who has been working on the same spot for more than the last 70 years!    I also want to point out, that the place is immaculately clean.  We had dinner that night elsewhere, and remarked back to what an amazing feat it was that Beauty's was so clean given the huge crowds they serve.  Really impressive.  A note about the star rating.  In a world where McDonalds gets 5-star ratings, I'm really tempted to give Beauty's 5 stars.  But  I'm not going in for star-inflation and I'm sticking by the guidelines: this is a really solid 4-star place.  The food is great, the prices are good (especially for this town), we both had breakfast for about $30.  Super fancy? no.  Super hip or upscale?  no.  Great food, great service, inexpensive, fun atmosphere?  Yes!  Bottom line, go there for breakfast, you won't be disappointed.  Be sure to say hello to Hymie!"}
{"text":"Old styled homemade food, so many people if you come at weekends. Their bagel is famous, we tried the bagel with smoked salmon, not as good as I expected"}
{"text":"Came here with my mom for brunch and the line up was very long because we came here during the holiday (jan 1). We waited 30 min in line. I ordered the omelette with fromage cheese, onion and mushroom with fries but I substitute it to tomatoes instead. My meal comes with their famous bagel . My meal came up to $13.50 per plate. My mom ordered mochaccino and their 'beauty's special' (bagel with smokes salmon , onion and cream cheese ) for $12 . My mom enjoy the bagel but I think the bagel is too hard . The savoury flavour of the cream cheese smokes salmon makes it taste so good. When u come here, make sure u order the beauty's special . The bill came up to $40 after tax and tips. They open till 4pm on New Years days."}
{"text":"The food is nothing out of the ordinary. I don't understand the hype around the place. Sure the decor is charming but the food is ordinary. Not bad, but not good. I don't think that the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"Close proximity to our apt and we arrived at the perfect time about 5 min after we sat down there was a huge rush (we arrived around 11:15 am Saturday morning for brunch) Pretty solid breakfast line up my only gripe is that everything is a la carte- Most places offer a side with sandwiches and egg dishes. We did the French toast and tuna melt, side of home fries and one cookies and cream shake to go. Yes the shakes are as good as everyone says they are. French toast was made with freshly bake challah bread but came with sesame seeds ... interesting twist.. Id probabaly come back but i wouldnt rush to do so there are so many brunch places on Rue Mont Royal"}
{"text":"The food was great - the service not so much. There's lots of lineups here at random times of day (especially on the weekends)."}
{"text":"Simple:   Order their special = Fairmount bagel with lox, red onions, tomatoes, and creamed cheese.  Add an order of a large cappuccino (it's sooo foamy and delicious!).  Then order seconds for both.  Done!  My friend and I just came for the bagel w/ lox specialty, but just because we were visiting Montreal and Beautys for the first time, we split a typical breakfast dish: 2 fried eggs, bacon, home fries (potatoes), side of toasted fairmount bagel, and that was done right. No complaints here.  We went early on a weekday so no lines, no wait. Service was a little slow, but nothing that was irksome."}
{"text":"What a fantastic, wholesome, heart-warming experience it was to come here for a Sunday brunch! Luckily, we got there before the big lineup outside happened, so I recommend getting yourself settled in before 11am.   I knew nothing about Beauty's before I walked in the door, but I feel like I now have a fuller appreciation of this part of Montreal, where Beauty's has been established since 1942! You know all those new hipster diner-esque cafés that you'll find elsewhere around Montreal? Well, they're ALL trying to be this. Beauty's is THE authentic, real-deal Montreal brunch diner -- the original. In fact, they invented the Montreal Brunch. The history behind Beauty's is rich and solid.   While we were seated at the lunch counter, which overlooks a gorgeous stylized stainless steel wall with shelves full of antiques as the main feature in kitchen, we had the opportunity to hear a little bit of the family history from the family itself. \"Beauty\" is actually the nickname of the original owner, Hymie, from his bowling league days, and became the name of this famous restaurant after its loyal clientele dubbed it so. Situated in the historical Jewish garment district, Beauty's is a long-standing inter-generational Jewish family affair, an exemplary successful family-run business. Hymie was behind the counter, as well as his son, Larry, who now runs the business. Larry was a laugh and a half, and so warm and open and welcoming!   Our brunch was your standard issue eggs and bacon done to perfection. I got my runny yolk fix, which I hungrily sopped up with a toasted St Viateur bagel. Their pancakes are classic grandma's kitchen style, light and fluffy. The BACON was crisp and the best-cooked I've had at any brunch spot in Montreal. I know that Beauty's is best known for its stellar bagel and lox, so I'll be wolfing that down the next time I'm in, and yes, this will be a regular brunch locay for me.   Also, I almost left with a bunch of Beauty's swag, because it's really nice - I mean, who wouldn't want to wear a toque that says, \"Beauty's\" in trucker-style scroll lettering on the front? I plan to pick up one of their Beauty's diner coffee mugs with the 40s starlet logo on the front. If you aren't sure about getting the swag just yet, Larry will invite you to leave with as many as you want of their lovely vintage-photo postcards.   This place made my weekend complete. Thanks, Larry and all the friendly service staff who kept me topped up with that endless cup of diner coffee! We love you."}
{"text":"Food is decent but didnt appreciate/like the attitude of the people working there. They wanted to kick us out as soon as possible. We paid our bills but still hadn't finished our drinks or food. They bought us the takeout bags, dumped the food and rest of the drink in a cup and told us to get out (we were there less than an hour for brunch). I understand people were waiting, but with this service I am not going back and tell my friends not to.."}
{"text":"This is a great little place for brunch that has a lot history. The guy that runs it Hymie greets you at the door. It took us about 20 minutes or so to get a table which was at Sunday brunch time which i would imagine is peak time so it was not too bad.   The food was great, it was classic american style brunch with pancakes, bagels, cream cheese, bacon, milkshakes and everything you would ever want to start off a great Sunday possibly after long Saturday night. There was a nice vibe about the place which added to it.   I was so full i could barely move afterwards. The price i thought was fairly costly for the type of food it is but still good.   My admiration for this place is the history and the fact its been a family business since 1942. I always respect places like this.   Make sure to get one of their milkshakes they are insane."}
{"text":"BEST BREAKFAST EVER!!!!!!!!  This is a cool old family diner that serves an awesome breakfast. French toast was perfection and the super beauty breakfast was amazing."}
{"text":"Solid, nice and clean.  Great wait staff= service with a smile...this is a typical diner, with solid food.  Nothing to write home about, but nothing to complain about either.  I did NOT have a smoothie or shake, so perhaps I short changed myself! :-)"}
{"text":"I love the diner feel of Beautys.. The hubby tells me this is a Montreal institution.. I must agree!  The menu is extensive.. Being a California girl I was a little disappointed that they didn't have Avocado, but I know they don't grow everywhere as freely.. I didn't knock it for this.. I ordered the greek style omlette, with feta.. egg whites please.. mm it was soo good.   Shannon raves over the Montreal bagel.. I hate to say this, I like Toronto's better.. Please no hate mail, we all have different taste buds.   Would I come back? Better believe it..."}
{"text":"Classic restaurant in the heart of the plateau. Take a step back in time when you walk through the doors. Service and food come together for the perfect meal. Add a classic milkshake for the grand finale."}
{"text":"I am a tourist and I didn't think Montreal is famous for their bagels? I always like new york bagel with Philly cream cheese. Beauty bagel sandwich has changed my mind. I like how crispy, thin and smaller they are. We order the Beautys special bagel with tomato, onion, cream cheese and lox. I wish they had capers. NYC bagel is too big to eat. The bagel from Beauty is about the right size, It is a family business and the daughter was out waitress. She had no problem of we Americans no speaking French. She was friendly and took her time to explain the food and thr history of th diner."}
{"text":"Beauty's does not disappoint. I have been going here since 1993 and aside from a few small changes to their menu (the addition of vegetarian baked brown beans is super), it's pretty much the same today. The bagels come from Fairmount and the coffee is good. Omelettes are sizable and it's easy to get carried away with sides. Coffee stands up and the service is friendly and bilingual."}
{"text":"Got there at 10sh on Wednesday. Maybe 3 tables of 2 were taken and the rest was empty. No one greets you with a smile and a good morning or hi or even a thank you or bye. We were a party of 4 ,the other 2 friends were late so they refused to seat us even though it was empty and even if we said we wanted to have coffee. Very unpleasant attitude. Its the type of breakfast that would be served in middle of nowhere on a highway or something. Grated potatoes were cold, eggs are just regular, pancakes are Aunt jemima's mix style, only thing was good was the St-VIATEUR bagel. They serve normal syrup and if you want maple syrup its 4$ for a few measured ml. Lmao. I definitely need to stop following the hypes on social media. There are soooo many amazing breakfast spots in mtl wth was this."}
{"text":"Beautys Lucheonette Montreal is one of those iconic restaurants that screams \"Montreal\". Located in the Plateau Mont Royal district, Beauty has been around since 1942. It was opened by newlyweds Hymie and Freda Sckolnick. The name Beautys was actually Hymie's bowling nickname. It remains a family business to this day. For you - just know the Beautys Special (smoked salmon, cream cheese, red onions and tomato on a toasted sesame seed St-Viateur bagel).  Beautys Special 11.50: This traditional lox is delicious! We liked the over the top slab of cream cheese and the combination of onions and tomatoes. The bagel was good but it was just a vehicle to carry everything.  Beautys Smoothie 6.50: When you are at Beautys, also order the Beautys Smoothie Classico - strawberry, banana and orange. As the name suggests, a classic, fruity drink that just brightens the day.   This diner is classic and very nostalgic. Seats may not be very comfortable but is a great mid-day or early morning breakfast spot. It is a great restaurant that won't break the bank. And if you looking to try the infamous Montreal bagel St. Viateur but is running out of stomache room to fit everything in; the Beautys Special brings that iconic Montreal experience along with the \"must eat\" factor!"}
{"text":"Went to Beauty's based on the other reviews. But I would say it's just a typical diner, nothing too exciting. It was fine, but not sure if I would say it's a must visit if you're in Montreal. It's just average."}
{"text":"Visited Beauty's based on Anthony Bourdain's travel show. And we were not disappointed."}
{"text":"The classic diner interior is appealing and well maintained. An OK place for a basic breakfast though the food is not remarkable. My hash browns were lacking flavour and had been over cooked. I could not eat the sausages. I was given butter from a plastic container even though others got fresh butter, and it had a bad plastic taste. My waitress was very kind when I asked for the real deal, and even swapped out my bagel. The service was friendly and welcoming. I would go back, though I wouldn't recommend waiting in a line if that's what you're faced with."}
{"text":"Very nice place, very nice staff great tasty food but the line is long, sure is a good sign though but it isn't fun to wait 30min for a seat but worth it though"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our late morning breakfast at Beauty's! The bagel, lox, cream cheese with tomato on a very fresh sesame bagel was heaven. I started with their green smoothie, which was spinach and fruit was just the right consistency and flavor. My husband had the Santorini omelette, cooked to perfection. The Russian black bread was really nice. Service was friendly and quick!! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I think I was in love with the place when I walked in and saw that it was old diner's decor, with stools and booths - and the postcards being given away.  We got here after our failed attempts in finding a \"Montreal deli house\"- thank goodness we failed, is all I can say. I think my BEST cup of coffee was experienced here - it was so good I drank it until I thought I was going to puke.  The food was pretty good - needed some seasoning - but the pancakes? well. nevermind those. I have tried better greasy spoons but the service, I think also justifies the cost here.  The server was incredibly friendly - I would give totally props - I think his name was Aaron? anyway, among all sorts of restaurants we'd been during our stay, he was the only server who engaged with us.  Great atmophere, good food and excellent service. I would totally go back."}
{"text":"Mi cugino and I went to Montreal for his Spring Break.  It was our international gastronomic adventure. This place had very many high reviews, but I think it was actually the low point on the food tour that we took.  As we walked in, some man at the front asked how many, but seemed irritated that there were two of us. \"We can't seat two at a time like this,\" he told his coworker.  Um...ok.  I guess when you're this popular you don't have to care if a guest feels welcomed.  He advised we wait outside in the glassed in area, which we did four about 5 minutes.  When we did get seated, it was at the bar which was reminiscent of the diners you see in movies about New York.    The servers were nice, kept making sure we were taken care of and that our beverages weren't empty. Since we were right by the waitress station, I had the privilege to hear the waitress talk about the drop dead gorgeous customer with a POS attitude.  The food was average.  I wouldn't call it bad, but it really had nothing to draw me back.  I got the special which is a bagel with schmear and lox, heavy on the cream cheese, light on the salmon.    The side of hashbrowns were nice and crispy and man, they kept slinging those suckers out! I was kind of turned off when the cook checked his phone and then went back to work.  I know this happens, but when you see it, it makes it real!"}
{"text":"This is a classic breakfast resto in Montreal, also a tourist stop. I had an egg sandwich on pumpernickel, it came with no sides. The wait is very long and frankly I think L'avenue has much better brunch for its value."}
{"text":"I find this place very over rated, the attitude of the staff is terrible (Saw a waitress being super bitchy to a senior customer over a 15% tip, very sad).  The \"beauty's special\" and the coffee are good, but everything else is just average, not worth the wait, not worth the taste."}
{"text":"Came here because this restaurant is a Montreal institution, and it lives up to the hype. Very good and filling breakfast, pleasant staff, charming diner."}
{"text":"Excellent little quirky breakfast spot. The adorable owner sat by the door and greeted each and every customer. The food was fantastic and the service was excellent. It's a small place so come early or be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"They have amazing lox and some of the airiest homemade cream cheese I have ever tasted.  I also ordered the omelet and it was good, but nothing to rave about. I will stick to the lox on my next visit.  It is to die for.  They have a very efficient and friendly service staff that makes you feel like a regular.  It is well worth the long lines no matter the weather.  This is a foodie must if you are in Montreal."}
{"text":"I was in Montreal in December and locals highly recommended this place for brunch. I was not disappointed at all! Nestled in Montreal's Plateau neighbourhood this place is a staple for locals and McGill students alike. A cute diner that's been around for 40+ plus years, it's exactly what springs to mind when you think old school diner.  I went with a group of friends just after the Christmas holidays. This meant the resto was opening an hour later for 8am and the much anticipated queues were nowhere to be seen. We got seated right away in a booth. Best! I ordered the pain dore (french toast) made on challah - egg on egg action with bacon. Delicious! Friends ordered pain dore with fruit and blueberry pancakes. We got hash for the table, more than enough to share. Coffee's were filled to the brim.  Such a lovely treat first thing in the morning. Must do if you're visiting the 514."}
{"text":"First breakfast place we went to when visiting Montreal, and was blown away. The food was really cheap and very delicious. Service was very good too. We went back our second morning but there was a line out the door, I understand why!"}
{"text":"What else needs to be said? It's an icon. Some people don't like icons, or at least what comes with icon status, i.e. mainly waiting in line to get in, and the occasional other imperfections (see other reviews) that come with running a wonderful place for many decades. And I don't think culinary creativity is the main event here, it's a diner, you either want that or you don't. Go to Beauty's when you want breakfast, done right, with a great family feel. There's a terrific \"kinda hip but not too self-consciously trying too hard\" vibe, really friendly, but of course very busy and a bit frenetic. Did I mention, it's a diner? They do what they do, well, and in our experience very consistently. It's one of our go-to spots when visiting Montreal. We have some great diners here in Philly, and if Beauty's were here, I'd go there as my first choice."}
{"text":"There are several so called Montreal 'Institutions', but Beauty's is one of the few that still deserves the distinction. Unfortunately there's always a wait, but there's a line of people waiting to get in because it's just that good! The service is always fantastic and Hymie and Larry are right there in front waiting to greet you and ensure you have a great meal. Fresh bagels, gigantic delicious smoothies, grilled salami, perfect american style fluffy pancakes, etc, etc, etc.......just lots of great food. Be sure to go in with an appetite, you get hungrier watching them serve delicious looking meals to the other tables."}
{"text":"Beauty's Luncheonette, un grand CLASSIQUE de Montréal pour un brunch le matin ! Ce petit resto, existant depuis 1942, nous fait voyager dans le temps et nous donne l'impression de replonger en plein coeur des années 40 (ici même pas besoin d'une machine à remonter le temps, tout est d'époque!).   Vu de l'extérieur, ça ne paye pas de mine et j'étais sceptique à l'idée d'y rentrer mais une fois à l'intérieur, on tombe sous le charme de ce décor vintage avec ces banquettes de cuir bleu, les stores entre ouverts, de vieilles pubs accrochées aux murs, des photos familiales en noir et blanc,...  Il faut arriver tôt chez Beauty's le week end, car souvent c'est la file jusqu'au trottoir. Cependant, on est tout de même très vite assigné à ces fameuses banquettes bien confortables et café est directement proposé (c'est à volonté, important à mentionner pour ceux qui ont besoin de plusieurs tasses afin d'émerger de grand matin)  On est accueilli par un vieux monsieur, le patron de l'établissement qui a plus de 70, 80 ans sûrement. Il est très sympa, souriant, on remarque que le Beauty's c'est toute sa vie !  J'ai opté pour le \"Superbeautys2\", pas décevant du tout. Un bon brunch à l'américaine: 2 ufs miroirs (pour moi), 2 pancakes, saucisses, bacon et pommes de terres ! Je me suis régalée surtout en faisant couler du sirop d'érable un peu partout (Oh mon dieu, je salive déjà), et comme si ça n'était pas assez,  hop un bon bagel avec beurre et confiture en sus ! Que c'est bon ! Comme quoi les choses simples sont parfois les meilleures ! Après ça, vous avez fait le plein pour la journée !   Les pancakes aux pépites de chocolat accompagnés d'une petit tasse de chocolat fondant chaud sont également testés et totalement approuvés !   Enfin, le rapport qualité, prix et quantité est plus que raisonnable.   Beauty's est pour moi à la hauteur de sa réputation et est le rendez vous à ne pas manquer lors d'une visite de Montréal !"}
{"text":"Food: 4/5 Service: 4/5 Location:3.5/5 On my last day in Montreal, we had to stop by the legendary Beauty's for one last brunch. Arriving at 1pm on a Sunday, the line extended out the door and snaked around the corner - I guess everybody else also came here after seeing some exceptional YELP reviews. After a half hour wait, we got seated in a booth and it felt like I was in a time warp. It had the classic American diner feel - vinyl booths, metal counter, and adorably sweet servers.   I ordered a grilled cheese with bacon on Challah bread while my friends' ordered pancakes and Beauty's trademarked MISH MASH omelette. The grilled cheese was fantastically greasy (I would've preferred a less processed tasting cheddar), and from what I could tell after stealing a couple bites, the pancakes were slightly crispy on the outside while still being perfectly fluffy inside. The MISH MASH was one of the best omelettes I've tasted.  Overall, Beauty's is worth the wait - perfect for an indulgent Sunday brunch after a long night of Montreal partying."}
{"text":"Hit the spot everything was delish! Service was quick my fresh oj was really great and the apple cinnamon pancakes were fresh  and really tasty"}
{"text":"This place has a great vibe and the best staff. The Mish-Mash was a revelation - who knew hot dogs, salami, and eggs together make brunch perfection? I've added Beautys to my must-go list for any future Montreal visits."}
{"text":"Russian rye rules!!! Good morning wake up on a cold winter's morning."}
{"text":"We went early Sunday morning thinking there would be a line- thankfully- almost empty! Once I looked around I expected it to be a great greasy breakfast so I ordered the usual eggs, bacon, home fries and toast plate which generally tells me how good a breakfast place is. If I had judged Beautys by this- I don't think I would have jumped to go back. I found the home fries to be similar to day old skinny french fries chopped up and warmed. The bacon and eggs were typically good but also arrived really fast which was nice. I really dislike waiting a long time for breakfast- it's the first meal of the day- I need it quick! :) What did really impress me- and why I'm going back to give a second chance- was our waitress and our 2nd dish. First, our waitress was fantastic. Really warm, smiley and genuine and our food literally arrived in minutes.  Second reason was the melt. Oh my word! They use challah bread (forgive me if I spelled it wrong) and we had a melt with egg, bacon and cheese. It was so simple and SO delicious! It literally melts in your mouth! The melt comes with a choice of meats and our waitress said it's even better with salami.  That bread is so good! I heard their French toast is made with the same bread so that's my next order!  It was about $30 for my plate, the melt sandwich, a chocolate shake and our coffees.  It was ok so far but I am excited to go back and try it again."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service! People were super friendly, and gave good advice regarding local tourist spots!"}
{"text":"First time at this Montreal land mark. Went on a Saturday around noon so it had a lineup out the door as anticipated, though it moved quickly. The owner Hymie was there to host and seat tables, making sure the restaurant was moving efficiently. Nice to see him still so involved, interacting with guests. Had the classic smoked salmon bagel with tomato and onion, montreal bagel was great, I have a bias towards my Nova Scotia smoked salmon, but overall a very tasting sandwich. Fresh fruit and coffee also very good. Well priced and great atmosphere with multiple generations of the family in house to serve the masses for breakfast. Must go to experience!"}
{"text":"The staff kinda verbally push you out the door once you pay. The food is nothing special. The place just stays open to keep some nostalgia in the neighbourhood but isn't worth the hype."}
{"text":"Had a nice time. Server was friendly and made a list of streets we should visit while in the area. Fairly quick service. Good food though you go more to experience the oldest-diner-in-Montreal-or-whatever-it-is more so than any claim on outrageously delicious food. Go if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Cute and cozy. Feels like you're in the 1950s! Extremely warm staff, a varied menu and delicious smoothies. A Montreal legend !"}
{"text":"We went to Beauty's today (Saturday) at 3:00 in the afternoon. It was packed. Only counter seating left but that was more than fine.  I ordered the salsa omelette and my boyfriend ordered the blintzes. We split a blueberry smoothie.  Every item was great. The omelette was flavourful and had just the right amount of kick. I've never had a blintz before. They were interesting - like sweet ricotta cheese inside a thin crepe. Served with sour cream and fruit on the side. Even the bagel that came with my omelette was above expectations. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised - after all, Montreal bagels are a thing.  I'm definitely going back next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Pretty over rated and over priced. As for breakfast most of their items can be found at other spots in the area for less And without a long tourist line"}
{"text":"omlette fromage with tomatoes and a frothy cappucino pour moi and a mish mash omlette pour Pablo, delish in a lovely old fashioned diiner.  We forsook the bagel and potatoes.  $40 for brekkie a little pricey but a lovely place with lots of choice.  Walking out Pablo said someone famous was behind us, who I said, Steven Pinker he said, a famous linguist who specializes in adverbs.  He ate his omlette hungrily.  Pablo knows all the stars."}
{"text":"Tourists. Hipsters. Beauty's is required as a Montreal icon. So I go as required and wait patiently in a never ending line. The food is standard fare-- but the standard fare is exceptional. Despite my cynicism--I love the bagels --and the pancakes. The Super Beauty Two is the most direct route to excess--pancakes, eggs, sausage, potato, bacon and bagels...ok I was a vegan until I was overwhelmed with the scent of animal fat. So fat satiated, I waddled out. It was worth it."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place and maybe my expectations were high but I wasn't impressed. THe breakfast potatoes were bland, the eggs were extremely oily, the pancakes were too doughy... not my favorite place at all but I liked the old diner look and feel to it. I would go back just for the ambiance. The service was great ... the waitress was on top of her game, super sweet."}
{"text":"This diner is the real deal. On my last day in Montreal, decided to come here for a club sandwich and boy, was I not disappointed. First of all, my pal and I arrived just after the lunch rush. It was still busy, but we were able to snag a booth in no time.   We both ordered up a cup of diner coffee, because how can you not? Settled into the comfy, worn in booths and poured over the menu. To be honest, the breakfast (served all day here) is worth it. You might even want to invest in one of their milkshakes. I didn't this time around, as mentioned.   The club sandwich is actually sectioned under the \"burger\" menu and is $13. It has three layers of goodness and the waitress will bring you extra mayo without even having to ask. The chicken is juicy. The bacon, crispy. The people watching, wonderful.   The staff were super kind and accommodating. I wish we had a Beauty's Luncheonette in Toronto, to be honest."}
{"text":"A very classic brunch spot in the plateau. The restaurant is very retro-chic, something straight out of a 1940s film. The menu is well varied and includes all the Montreal classics, like their delicious smoked salmon bagel. The french toasts are very good, and are always one of my favourites here. The portions are big so the price is very decent. During the winter there is sometimes a bit of a wait, but once you get inside you will instantly forget about the cold. :)"}
{"text":"Beauty's is a corner diner known for great breakfast food. As Mitch S. pointed out, it is a tourist spot, so being a tourist, I had to check it out. Breakfast food is hard to mess up but it can get really greasy. The Superbeautys 2 I ordered wasn't greasy at all, even with the sausages. Worst part of the meal was the freshly squeezed orange juice. At three Canadian bucks, the orange better have been squeezed by Gisele Bundchen's asscheeks.  The best part of the meal was, not surprisingly, the bagel. I've heard so much about Montreal's bagels and my skepticism as a New Yorker was definitely misguided and immediately debunked. The bagels are GREAT. They're small, almost half the size of a NYC bagel, but the density is there. I'm not claiming Beautys bagels to be the best, but it definitely set the bar high.  Would I go back to Superbeautys when i'm in town? Probably not. The food was good but not mind-numbingly spectacular enough for me to spend a morning there instead of at another breakfast spot. But if you haven't been there before, it's definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Classic Montreal diner breakfast, with a fun DIY Bloody Mary service. Went for the classic bagel, stayed for the smoked salmon and latkes."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and the best part about this busy weekend spot is that the employees actually seem happy. I've been to so many crowded and busy diners like this where everyone seems to hate their job but it is not the case here. Some items are pricey but you can get reasonable priced and tasty options as well. They also serve alcoholic beverages."}
{"text":"I rate this place not only for the food, but the feel is exactly what I hoped/imagined a North American diner experience would be like.  The big breakfast (called \"Beauty's 2\" on the menu - I'm not sure what happened to #1) is great, and highly recommended. The bagels are as good as you'd expect for a Jewish-run restaurant in Montreal - flawless.  The pancakes are top notch, but I particularly like the normal ones best (rather than the blueberries ones). There's probably nothing wrong with the blueberry pancakes, but they just didn't live up to my (admittedly high) expectations. I consider myself a Blueberry Expert, and I haven't found a food that can't be improved by stuffing it with blueberries. Unfortunately, these ones just didn't make it. Stick to the plain ones.  Even with all these good things, the stand-out on the menu for me is their cookies-and-creme smoothie. Oh. My. G-d. It is amazing. I'm lucky Beauty's is on the other side of the mont from my home, or I would have gorged myself on it way too many times already.  TLDR; Go and try the cookies-and-creme smoothie. Everything else is good, but not as good as the smoothie."}
{"text":"My experience on todays Monday brunch at Beautys was OK. Prices were way over priced and waitress service rushed.  Sure we were there at an odd time but a polite \"I am finishing soon could I get you anything else? Mind if I hand you the bill early?\" Would've been a much nicer thing to do. I don't understand the deal but its okay. As far as food was concerned it was average nothing bad or awesome greatness to leave the experience memorable. However the expensive bill didn't leave me quiet satisfied which led to the 2 star. Overall I wouldn't be upset over this ome experience I do look forward to anyone else dragging me here to give this place another try. Aside that I doubt my legs will lead me to this destination."}
{"text":"What a nice dinner in the plateau to have a good ''fat and greasy'' brunch (healthy options also on the menu of course). Open since 1942 this place has an history and you are still welcome by the owner of the place a short and sweet man really friendly. The place is small so be sure that you will be facing a line up especially around 10:30 to 1pm. But the food is worth of the wait. I heard that the pancakes were delicious so of course I ordered some. In fact with my friend we shared 2 plates : the smoked salmon bagel (a huge bagel full of tomatoes and cream cheese) and also the beauty's specialty (a plate with pancakes, 2 eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes and bagel on the side). What a great meal. I am a fan of brunch and for sure I will come back. The service is old fashion, friendly, waitresses seemed to know all the regular guests, they want you to feel comfy a little bit at home and it works perfectly. Coffee is also really good and that's a plus for them. Finally, really affordable, we love that! I remove a star because of the lack of the comfort on the seats (table of 2 are for tinny people lol) and also because of the kitchen noise."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday morning and it surprisingly wasn't as packed as I expected! Very relaxing atmosphere with friendly, quick service. - Beauty's Special: Sesame bagel with lox. Yummy! Pretty straight forward sandwich and hard to mess up, but at the same time, very tasty - Waffles with sausage: Crunchy and fluffy at the same time, with good maple syrup. Sausage links were fine, but nothing special.  Really cute little diner with the owner still on site. Good food, good service, but I wouldnt wait in line for more than 30 minutes (which I imagine is the case on weekends or peak hours)."}
{"text":"I am completely smitten with Beauty's. The concept, the food, the charm, and most of all The Man behind it all, Mr. Hymie Sckolnick. He opened up the restaurant in 1942 and to this day, he still runs the restaurant at 91 years of age. You are first greeted at the door by a long ass line. If you feel any negativity about having to wait on said long ass line, the negativity soon evaporates once you are greeted at the front of the line by Hymie himself in his 91 year old glory. You'll be initially confused because he will greet you with a \"you're welcome\", only to realize that he means it as in \"You are welcome here.\"   And that is precisely the environment that Beauty's has achieved. The friendliness of the staff, the hominess of the cushy blue booths, and the I-could-eat-this-for-breakfast-every-day-of-my-life quality of food makes every patron feel welcome and serve as the reasons why people can't get enough of this place.    I would recommend anything and everything off of their menu, but especially implore you to order anything that includes bagels (freshly baked!) and/or challah (i.e. thick pieces of carbs that are doused in butter and then toasted and then glazed with more butter). You'd probably also regret not trying the Beauty's Special of lox + a ton of cream cheese + bagel.  If you're a New Yorker, you will love this place because it's exactly the kind of authentic old-school, neighborhood diner that the amalgam of new faux-diner establishments try  to emulate."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Anthony Bourdain show. He was eating a bagel with lox and i had to try it. I was not disappointed. Very fresh and lox was delicious. Fresh squeezed orange juice too. My boyfriend had their omlette special mishmash. If you like salami and hotdogs in your morning omlette you will love it.  Gave it four stars because of the long wait for the food. Others that came in after us received their food first, but dont let this stop you from trying this place when in Montreal."}
{"text":"This place deserves a 5 for the filling comfort food breakfast, but most importantly the warm greeting from owner Hymi Sckolnick (92 years old!)... two days in a row!   The portions are huge and everything was very tasty and has a home cooked feel.  The home fries are amazing and the Superbeauty 2 breakfast meal is more than enough to share. Bagels from St. Viateur bakery are obviously amazing. Definitely a cool, iconic place to enjoy breakfast and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Recently I returned to Beauty's for the first time in a long while. I live in the area and I'm very used to seeing the long line-up every morning at Beauty's. Unfortunately, I didn't find that my last visit blew my socks off. Everything in our breakfast was very average with the potatoes being sub-par at best. While I am happy to vouch for their grilled cheeses and milkshakes from previous visits, I can't say that breakfast is worth the wait. This is especially true given that there are TONS of other brunch options in the plateau."}
{"text":"LOVE the retro design, the variety of breakfast/ brunch options and the service was great! Although it's a little pricy the experience worth it. Enjoyed every bite and even bought a beauty's coffee mug ;)"}
{"text":"My favorite brunch spot in the city ^-^ they have bagels to die for!"}
{"text":"I love diners. Nothing like finding a good diner when travelling. This one was a real Beauty!  An old school diner classic in Montreal. Retro look and feel, along with a menu of diner staples.  People around these parts told me to get something on a bagel. They actually have pretty decent bagels in Montreal so I took their advice.  Get the do it yourself Bloody Mary's and the \"Beauty's Special\" lox on a bagel. Thank me later. It's more than enough to satisfy. Yum!  Cool and simple, and it was a lot of fun to get a tray of ingredients to build our own bloody's. I was able to squeak out a few with what they gave us.  Perfect way to spend a few hours on a weekday afternoon in a classic joint chatting with the original owner Hymie and his son, the present owner Larry. A Montreal institution that is worthy of the distinction."}
{"text":"I went here in November 2015. I had their country omelet and macaroni and cheese. It was fantastic, god tier, if I may say. I'll definitely come back whenever I'm in Montreal again."}
{"text":"Got the standard breakfast. Everything was yummy. 1 star ding for mandatory 18% tip on table of 5 when one of us was a 2 year old."}
{"text":"Awesome old-school diner with a pleasant, homey atmosphere and solid Montreal bagels. They make killer sandwiches (the Beauty's Breakfast Melt on grilled challah was excellent) and big milkshakes, too. The guy running the hosting station at the front (I think his name is Hymie) is a treat to talk to."}
{"text":"Old school diner that's a bit cramped but they serve a delicious breakfast. The pancakes are fluffy, the potatoes are crisp, and the eggs are well cooked. I can see why people line up for this place."}
{"text":"For a second breakfast stop, my mother decided to sleep in (conserve capacity) while my aunt and I trekked to Beauty's, the 1942 bruncheonette on the corner of Mont Royal West and St. Urbain.  Perhaps not as famous as St. Viateur or Schwartz's, fans and the local media still place the small diner on the same \"Best of\" and \"Iconic\" lists and unlike the former, original owner Hymie Sckolnick is still involved as he approaches his tenth decade of life.  With an opening hour of 7am, and after a near-ticket with a local police officer targeting people for taking left-turns on a nearby street we arrived at Beauty's perhaps fifteen minutes after opening and after looking at the myriad articles posted in the small entry way entered to find only a few locals sitting at the bar.  Greeted promptly by one of three servers we were led to a booth where menus were provided, coffee was ordered, and we were left to make our choices from a number of deli classics and a few Montreal specialties such as the \"Mish-Mash.\"  Sitting and browsing the menu as well as the space, Beauty's is pretty much exactly what you'd expect from an old-school Jewish diner - kosher meats, a small selection of baked goods, and breakfast staples like pancakes, challah French toast, bagels, cream cheese, and lox in a room full of small booths and a long counter where short-order cooks quickly and quietly put together breakfast plates while chatting with the clientele while friendly waitresses performed their duties expediently.  Orders placed and by now working on my second cup of thin but well flavored 'joe as my aunt sipped on a large glass of fresh squeezed orange juice it would not be long before our first item arrived - a small order of house made \"Pouding Au Riz\" for $4 plus a 40ml serving of pure maple syrup for $2.50.  Realizing, of course, that profit margins at a place like Beauty's are not that high and setting aside my general distaste for paying extra for a condiment I will say that the rice pudding itself was unremarkable in most ways - a bit too thick, a bit too congealed, and not enough of the golden raisins to balance the lack of vanilla or sweetness.  Adding a bit of the syrup helped, but I also had to conserve for my main course.  Moving next to the aforementioned mains, pancakes for my aunt and French Toast for myself - specifically Apple Cinnamon pancakes and Challah French toast and the former once again proving the point that my aunt simply cannot and should not ever order pancakes as each disc was pleasantly golden but far too dense and largely lacking any semblance of apple or cinnamon flavor aside from the few small chunks of apples mixed into the batter.  Not one to fancy syrup but instead opting for powdered sugar or sugar on her cakes I think my aunt had anticipated cooked apples served overtop but instead was left high and (quite literally) dry for $7.50.  For my part, particularly with the addition of the overpriced syrup (which they did not even provide me in the special \"Beauty's\" glass bottle,) I have to admit that the $7.50 Challah French Toast was the star of the morning with the dense eggy bread nicely saturated with vanilla tinged custard and seared to a golden tan.  Slightly crisp on the exterior and just a bit 'wet' in the middle there was nothing fancy about the toast - just a good rendition of a classic making me wonder if perhaps Beauty's is the sort of place where one should just stick to the script and order eggs and bacon...an answer I'll probably never know as I'd be very hard pressed to return."}
{"text":"I love diners they are so qt. lets you step back in time to the 50s, but without all the bigotry and racism.   I came in with a limited amount of time since I had to run to a meeting, but I was served immediately and my food came out in less than 10 minutes. I'm just visiting from NYC and I have to say Montreal gives us a run for our money when it comes to bagels... So I think the bagel was my favorite part of the meal.   All the servers seemed really nice and the ~legendary owner Hymie was chilling at the end of the bar as well. Cool spot."}
{"text":"Beautys is a Montreal legend, with Hymie as the main attraction.  He still sits by the door greeting customers after 65+ years, and he'll still tell you the wait is \"about 5 minutes\" regardless of how many people are in front of you in line...  That being said, the wait (always more than 5 minutes) is worthwhile.  The Special (lox, cream cheese, tomato, onion on a bagel) is about as good as it gets. It's a little overpriced, but after eating it, you won't mind.  The OJ is fresh squeezed.  The carrot cake is over the top.  And if you order the rice pudding (you should), ask for some extra cinnamon. It's better that way.   All that to say, Beauty's reputation is well-deserved.  Check it out when you're in Montreal."}
{"text":"Some folk say it's overrated some folk love it. If you're looking for an authentic diner experience in Montreal then this is the place for you.   For three generations, they've been making milkshakes, breakfasts, brunches and brunch in this kitsch little diner.  What it lacks tourist trap bobby socks it more than makes up for in authenticity.  We went in as a group of 5 for brunch. I had the Super Beauty 2 breakfast with a shake. I finished the lot and licked the plate!  Great fun and great food."}
{"text":"Nice place for a traditional quebecois brunch! I went there with a friend. We shared a bagel with saumon and cheese, and a dish with eggs, sausages, bacons, pancakes and potatoes. They tasted very delicious. This is a very popular place. Be ready to line up before going. lol."}
{"text":"I ordered the salmon bagel it was half filled with tomatoes and barely felt the salmon The french toast was ok. The Santorini omelet was really good. The major problem was the constipated staff plus the owner sitting at the door shouting at people who won't sit where he tell them to.  Money wise it was soo expensive compared to what u get."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch at 1:30pm on a Friday.  We walked right in and were greeted by Hymie himself, who promptly found us a table with little wait.  We came to order the 2 flagship dishes - the mish-mash omelet and the beauty's special (montreal bagel w/ lox, tomato, onion, and cream cheese).  Both were nicely prepared and the potatoes that came with omelet were nice and crispy.  All in all I thought the place lived up to the hype - an old-school diner turning out quality casual fare, with a lot of history and character to boot.  I particularly thought the omelet was interesting and unique - can't find something like that anywhere else! Worth a stop when you are in town.  Definitely better to go on a weekday if possible to cut down on wait times."}
{"text":"Classic Diner spot that seemed to have a lot of history and has been open for decades, so I was glad to check it out since it was right in the neighborhood.   Beautys is a diner that makes it very clear all over their menu and through their servers that you should order their Beautys Special, so that's what I did. It's salmon on a bagel, but amplified. It's got that classic, sesame coated Montreal-style bagel with some of the fluffiest cream cheese I've ever had (and to their credit is homemade) and solid salmon. It was a solid, fairly priced breakfast to kick off the day.   I would have loved to have tried one of their shakes but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Let's see...10 bucks for a tuna melt.  Just a tuna melt...no pickle, no cole slaw, not even a decorative piece of lettuce.  Just a slab of sandwich cut in two and tossed onto a white plate.  The food wasn't bad, but I had a limited amount of meals to eat while in Montreal.  Would I have wasted time in this diner if I could do it again? Nope."}
{"text":"I've been dying to dine at Beauty's for ages now, but have never gotten the chance due to the seemingly endless lineups. Quick side note: your best bet is to go on a weekday after 12pm because the wait on the weekend is insane, and it's always pretty busy in the morning.   Upon walking in, my party and I were greeted by whom I assumed to be the owner. I immediately fell in love with the diner-like atmosphere. To be honest, I never realized how small the restaurant was. Anyway, we were seated at a booth and quickly served. The waitress was amazing - so sweet and accommodating. Even though I always get the same thing for breakfast, the homemade potatoes that I ordered were the best I've ever had, especially because they're not deep fried which seems to be the norm at breakfast places. Everything was fantastic and I genuinely enjoyed myself. The rest of my party was also extremely satisfied. I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Don't go here!  If you want to be able to finish your meal or your coffee without being hustled out and them clearing the table while you are still eating or drinking then don't come here.  I mentioned this to the manager (wasn't Hymie) and he insulted us, showed us the door, and told us to go to Starbucks next time...this after dropping $40 for eggs, coffee, juice and bagels - which are just OK anyways.  Have been coming here for 40 years since my early McGill days and this was the absolutely last time.  Do yourself a favor and go to any of the many better, less-hyped, cheaper, better serviced restaurants in the area (some just a block or two away)."}
{"text":"I finally made it to Beauty's after years of visiting Montreal. We got lucky and went right in after only a few minutes outside in line. My special was really good. Bagel, smoked salmon, cream cheese, tomato, red onion. The bagel was packed full of toppings and well-balanced. My wife's burger wasn't as good, possibly a frozen patty.   The ambiance was great though; a classic diner room inside with lots of character. I probably wouldn't line up for an hour but I wouldn't hesitate to come back if I could get in quickly."}
{"text":"Un dinner de la belle époque ! N'y chercher pas la subtilité, on ne vient pas ici pour ca. Parfait pour un bon brunch classique : omelettes delicieuses, bon bagels mais surtout des pancakes à tomber par terre !"}
{"text":"Food was great and the service even better. The prices are awesome and servings are amazing I have tried to steer clear of eating at the same Place when I travel but I couldn't help it this is my 3rd day here and it has not dissapointed. Great waitresses and service that doesn't make you feel bad.    We have gotten the:  BBM: this sandwich is a great example of the food crispy buttery brioche sharp cheddar thick cut tomatoes and perfectly fried egg it's truly a religious experience.  Roast Beef Sandwich: perfect on the soft onion bun with melted cheese and hearty well seasoned beef it comes with a side of horseradish perfectly fit for the sandwich!  Beauty's Basic: Classic eggs are always made perfectly and you can interchange he standard bagel if it's not your style with meat I highly recommend the bacon!  Beauty's burger: Amazing piping hot and cooked perfectly served with pickle lettuce and tomato home fries or coleslaw it's really a treat.  Beauty's special: the beauty's basic with pancakes served with maple syrup and lots of butter and jam it's a banger as well.  Chocolate shake: my sister order this but I def. took down 1/4 of it it was watery In terms of what I am used to but it was still good  malted and creamy perfection.  Rice pudding: dense and creamy with golden raisins and cinnamon on the side which I highly recommend you sprinkle on as it gives it depth.  Fresh squeezed Orange juice: need I say more? It was Perfect too damnit and frankly I am tired of talking about it I just want to eat it!!!"}
{"text":"In the span of 2 minutes I fell in love with Beautys.    One of my friends suggested that I come here (she always comes when she's in Montreal visiting her grandma) but I have to admit that I hadn't had the time.  But serendipitously, on the way back to the Metro from Mont Royal, I passed it on my last day in Montreal and decided that I had to stop in.  There was a line out the door to get a seat, but my colleague and I didn't have time to sit down and eat.  So we nudged our way inside and the gruff older gentleman sitting at the counter with a cup of coffee asked if he could help us.  We explained that we didn't have time to eat but that we'd heard that their bagels were the best in Montreal (a little flattery can go a long way!) and could we just buy some to take away.    2 minutes later I had a bag with a 1/2 dozen bagels for $4 and change.  Pretty good deal and we were on our way.  When I finally broke into the bagels they were not only some of the best I'd ever had (not like the huge, doughy New York style ones, but a bit drier and thinner which I liked) but my dad must have liked them so much that he ate the one I was saving for my friend...  Next trip, I'll have to buy a dozen."}
{"text":"If you are absolutely dead set on trying this place out, go during a weekday. Nothing special, in fact very average. I can get a better tasting lox bagel in NY for a third of the price. The service was great, but only for the tables around us. A party of 4 were digging into their food while we were still waiting for our waitress to arrive. All in all very standard diner food, at a premium price tag. Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Fast service and yummy food. French toasts are my favourites !"}
{"text":"We had really high expectations for Beauty's after reading plenty of reviews and after walking past it every day and seeing a line out the door. On our last day in Montreal we finally had the time to wait in line to get a seat, unfortunately we were seated at the bar.  This place is the epitome of a diner. I love the vibe, however the waitress was not very attentive.. and we were asked to move down so they could fit more diners. The food was OK. That's all I have to say about the food, it didn't blow me away.  The apple pie smoothie was interesting but gave me the shits. There are other breakfast places that beat here for sure, not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Maybe its the fact that I had such a high expectation from this place. Over a year I walked by it and saw the long waiting lines during weekends.  Last week I had a chance to go try it with a friend visiting from NY, Friday morning, no lines, sweet. The service was excellent, the food was great but well nothing that made me say \"I MUST RE-VISIT\". I had a good time and a good expirience but this is just one more great dinner in Montreal..."}
{"text":"Très jolie place, on ressent l'histoire du lieu. Les assiettes sont peu garnies surtout pour le bagel saumon. Grand choix de smoothies et de milkshakes. Place peu agréable pour les groupes de plus de 6 personnes."}
{"text":"C'est tu pas beautiful ça? C'est ce que je me suis dis quand j'ai reçu mon assiette à ma première visite chez Beauty's. Depuis, j'y suis allée à quelques reprises quand l'envie d'un bon gros brunch accompagné d'un milkshake me prend.  Les assiettes sont grosses, très grosses. Ça vaut la peine de partager, surtout si vous voulez goûter à plusieurs plats. Les pancakes sont très bonne, et bien qu'il y ait plusieurs choix (bleuet, chocolat, pomme et cannelle) se sont celles natures que j'aime le mieux. Les omelettes sont remplies de légumes/viande/saumon dépendamment de vos choix. La majorité des plats sont accompagnés de belles « pétates » et de bagels au lieu de toasts.  Les milkshakes sont aussi très bons. Ils sont assez gros pour être un repas à eux même. Personnellement, j'aime bien celui à saveur « Cookies and Cream » qui me rappelle un peu les Blizzards aux Oreos de Dairy Queen, mais simplement meilleur et un peu plus spécial parce que je me commande rarement de la crème glacée pour accompagner mon déjeuner.  L'ambiance de « dinner » à l'américaine donne du charme à l'endroit qui existe depuis plusieurs années. C'est une des institutions de Montréal. Les napperons en papier ont de jolies images de milkshakes qui me donne le goût d'emmener mes crayons de cire pour dessiner en attendant le repas. Il y a un vieil homme à la porte qui vous accueille et vous pointe vers votre table. Je suspecte que ça soit le proprio mais je ne lui ai jamais demandé. Bref, l'endroit est plein de petits détails qui rendent l'expérience amusante et qui vous donne le goût d'y retourner."}
{"text":"I was SO disappointed by the food and the service. I went there on a Sunday with my boyfriend for brunch, we didn't wait too long since we were only two, but were welcomed by a very unfriendly waitress who did not smile for the whole meal. I asked for making certain meals vegetarian by replacing the ham with mushrooms, to which she replied with a condescending smile that meat can only be replaced with 2 slices of tomato (!). The food was pointless and super expensive for that matter and potatoes were undercooked.  Fine, the setting is nice and you feel like you go back in the 1950s, but I'm first looking for a culinary experience when I go to a restaurant and we found the complete opposite!"}
{"text":"Such a cute little diner, still ran by the owner himself (he runs the whole show, seating everyone, etc) small, food comes out quickly, service is better than what I have had in all of Montreal. I got the lox plate which was delicious, comes with 2 sesame Montreal bagels, creamed cheese, red onions as well as tomatoes. The Bloody Mary was the star of the show though. They bring you a can of tomato juice, Tabasco, horseradish and a couple of other things to make your own Bloody Mary! A very clever idea. A must go to while visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"I told my good friend Anthony Bourdain about this place. Soft Millennials would complain that the staff could be friendlier, but it's part of the charisma of old-school Montreal Jewish Diners. Beauty's is the true Montreal breakfast classic."}
{"text":"The best breakfast. I had the signature dish the mish mash.  It was so good.  I loved the look of the place. It had an old fashion luncheonette look."}
{"text":"Certain restaurants in Montreal are what one would call institutions. As a local Montrealer, these are places that you should get to at some point because to miss them is to miss out on experiences that are part of what makes Montreal special when it comes to food. Schwartz's, Moishes (eventually in my case), Laurier BBQ before the Ramsey fiasco, St-Viateur and/or Fairmount bagels (depending on where you side on that debate but that's a story for another day), etc.... In the end, you may leave slightly underwhelmed because your experience couldn't possibly match up to the hype but regardless, they are places that you must experience for yourself.  Beauty's is such a place. A staple of Montreal since 1942, they have been owned by the same family the whole time and have been serving up breakfast in Mile End ever since. Any day of the week you pass by, you will see a line-up outside. On this beautiful thanksgiving weekend, before heading to watch the Alouettes sadly get beat at Molson Stadium, I finally got my chance to visit Beauty's with some friends for a little late breakfast.  Beauty's is known for their special - cream cheese, smoked salmon and onion on a bagel. However, I am not much of a fan of smoked salmon so I chose to go with the Beauty's basic - two eggs, home fries, one meat with a bagel. A simple dish but one that must be spot on if you are worth your salt as a breakfast place. Very good overall. The home fries in particular were quite delicious.  To that, we originally ordered some latkes and I took a Classico Beauty's smoothie. However, they had run out of latkes by the way we got our order in. So just the smoothie would have to do. Strawberry, banana and orange juice - simple but classic. A nice thick consistency and very delicious. The perfect complement to a nice breakfast.  Is it a earth shattering breakfast? Not exactly. But it is a Montreal landmark that serves a very good breakfast. The place looks exactly like what you think it would - a diner that has been going since 1942. It has a wonderful old fashion feel that I absolutely love - right down to the owner greeting you at the door and joking with you as you wait for your table. You may want something more unique or different for breakfast but that's not Beauty's and that's fine. They simply do a damn fine breakfast as they have been doing since 1942. For that reason alone, you need to check it out. I waited way too long. You don't have to make that same mistake.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Diners are my weakness. I love them. I don't know what it is. Gimme some old school nostalgic decor. Pour me a cup of joe with a saucer place. Gimme some milkshake options and standard diner grub and I'm a happy girl. Seriously though. Be still my breakfast-loving heart. This place serves soft ice cream as well. The kid in me was dying because it was socially acceptable to order a breakfast meal with ice cream. Naturally I opted for the waffle with fruit and ice cream. It was perfect. Waffle and fruit and ice cream in every bite. If that's wrong, I don't want to be right.   The servings are good, big portions. I was happy with my waffle, giant cup of fruit and a giant cup of ice cream. It was both refreshing and filling without being too sweat. It was a beauty. ;)"}
{"text":"This place has been around for a long time and it is well known. Me and my friends came here last year. The line was as bad as I thought it would be. I ordered the superbeauty 2. This entree has eggs, sausage, bacon, pancakes and homefries. It is very delicious and I recommend people coming here."}
{"text":"The Beauty Special was enjoyable, but everything here is way overpriced and the line was ridiculous. I get that you're paying for the \"experience,\" whatever that is, but I've been to my share of diners and this is nothing special. The home fries were bland, boiled potatoes, half of them burnt. Don't waste your precious time and appetite."}
{"text":"Decided to visit since it has so much history in Montreal. Was happy with brunch but not swept off my feet, so to speak.  Food: we had the super beautys 2 and the salmon bagel. Both were great - but they're pretty hard to get wrong in the first place.  Service: food came fast and service was nice. I'm aware that people sometimes wait very long to get in here, but we went very early.  Price: could be better since it's pretty simple for brunch plates. Not too bad though.  Ambiance: old school diner feel, but had no music when I was there which was strange feeling with few other customers around at that time in the morning."}
