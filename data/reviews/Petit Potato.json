{"text":"The service was really really really bad! The attitude made me do not wanna come here again!"}
{"text":"Went for the oh-so-popular mango toast. It was much more toasted than expected to the point where the roof of my mouth was scratched raw from eating it.   Huge serving - can be demolished by two if you REALLY TRIED. Not worth the hype or price though.   Tldr; Not so hype. Toast was rock hard. $$$$$ but its a big serving."}
{"text":"5-stars, FOR REAL?!  Are you partial owner or know the staff there?!  You must have had the best service and the chef's must of been on their A-game.  That tower looks like somebody took a diarrhea on stacked bread. I agree 100% with everybody in saying the staff needs to apply at McDonalds and learn some customer service (at least some English.  That was a slightly discriminant, but no whip cream doesn't mean bring an extra cup of water).    I always order savory dishes, but it's nothing praise-worthy.  It's not nasty tasting or blow my mind incredible, it was edible.  Here's my story, a few weeks ago my wife and I decided to go for an afternoon snack and ordered a simple banana and strawberry crepe.  30 minutes later they decide to mention to us that the crepe hotplate was broken, then turn 180 and say it wasn't broken.  Don't bullshit a bullshitter, you NEED to mention this 2 minutes AFTER I order so I don't have to sit there like a shmuck and wait 30 minutes.  Anyways the crepe had a great taste of strawberries and bananas, 5 stars.  Would I go back?  Certainly, it's cheaper than Asian Legend and it comes with a drink!"}
{"text":"Unbelivably slow with the service. The waiteress gave my food to another customer who came in later than me and when I asked where my food was, she said the chef missed the order. Waited for more than 30 mins for my food. The food wasn't that great either. Defintely not worth my time. Additionally, one of the waitresses even spilled the soup on my mom's face/shirt when cleaning up the table."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday afternoon with a couple friends. The decor and vibe of the restaurant was quite stylish, unique, and visually appealing. There wasn't anyone at the front when we entered, so we had to wave down a waiter to get seated. Our group of 5 ordered a total of 6 dishes, which amounted to about $80. The savoury dishes were good, but not amazing. We were a bit disappointed by how little eel came with the Omurice, and the curry tasted exactly like what you'd get at an Asian supermarket. The sweet dishes were much better, although we had to wait about an hour to get the toast after we ordered it. The fruits tasted quite fresh, and the iced tea was very refreshing on a hot day. The toast tower had a crispy outside and a soft inside, which was yummy.  Overall, not a bad experience, but not noteworthy either. May give it another try the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Omu-rice is good but it was a bit smaller that I expected (btw since u can't really see inside the omu-rice I'll tell you this now it has mushrooms in it), they also got my Order wrong for the omu-rice but that didn't mean it was any less tasty. I also order the ramen and the soup was great, I really like how the ramen soup is less oily then the noodle soup I'm used to so I kinda drank the who bowl of soup."}
{"text":"It's pretty good but i've noticed itms been basically the same menu after every rebrand they have done with this store and everytime they just change the english name, keep the chinese one and jack the prices..."}
{"text":"I was there with my wife to try out this restaurant. It was late noon and not many people.  The service and people are great.  The food is also great. I had Ramen with popcorn Chicken while my wife had the one with rice/egg with toppings.  I would recommend this place for people who just want to have a quick bite.  I heard it could get pack in the evening.  Therefore, best to try it during the late noon like 1:30-2 pm."}
{"text":"Who serves gyudon and doesnt provide any of that sweet egg yolk sauce???  Rice with cooked beef and onion with half a boiled egg.  When i asked the server if there should be any sauce, she said thats the way the dish is.  It made the whole rice bowl so dry.  Please if you are going to offer a japanese dish, do it right!!!"}
{"text":"You can always count on them for a quick and easy meal that is made up to standard.   Their desserts are good; I love the house special milk pudding.   The place has a nice atmosphere and during their quieter hours, is a good place to do some work. Staff are friendly and nice!  YMMV on their more ample meal choices. I like their ramens, but not much of a fan of their omurice.   3.5/5"}
{"text":"To clarify, things here are not petit, nor are they made of potatoes. But I'm not disappointed.   Enjoyed all the other desserts a lot. The toast was the least special, despite having the most hype. Of course, just my opinion. :)  Fun place for dessert. The wait time can get a bit ridiculous (for toast!), but the staff are considerate and quite accommodating. Call ahead for reservations if you can, even if you call in the car on the way over. It makes a big difference, and we were given a table for 8 by calling just 10 minutes ahead. Late evening is the busiest time to come, although it's also the best time in terms of atmosphere, people watching, and general sweet-tooth time.   I had actually not read any of the reviews or even heard about this place before coming here. I just drove by, saw the name and though...Petit Potato...I wonder what they serve. Went home, everyone else seemed interested, and off we went!  Perhaps, that was the trick. Come with fewer expectations. I imaging that now it's on blogTO, people may have some expectations.   We ordered a few things to share. Almost all were pretty good.  - Roasted Marshmallow Custard Toast smelled amazing. It came out and I immediately thought of those coconut custard buns at Chinese bakeries. It did cool off pretty quickly, and then some of the magic went away, as most of its appeal is in the aroma, but still excellent.   - Golden Mango Rolls were a standout. They're like cheong fun, but sweet, with a slippy noodle like wrapper and mangos on the inside.   - Sweet Five Assorted Dumplings w Coconut Milk was also very good. A fun twist on your typical glutinous rice balls.   - Mango Special Gold Toast. This was the $15 toast. Definitely bring friends to share this with, as it can easily feed about 4 people. More if you order other things as we did. We were warned it would take about 30 minutes to make, and it did take about that time. Despite the build-up and the quite impressive toast mountain that finally arrived, this was probably my least favourite thing from the evening. It was just one flavour (mango cream) all the way through, and a bit boring after a while. The toast is, no surprise, very toasty. And the mango cream is, as expected, mango-y and creamy. Honestly, once was enough, I don't think I'd come back just for this."}
{"text":"It's 3.5.  We had:  Beef striploin Steak Omurice with black pepper sauce ($12.99): The \"wrapped egg rice\" was above average.  However the steak was low quality.  Rating: 2.5/5  Mango special golden toast ($14.99): I think this is a must try if you have 3-4 people to share.  Be prepared to wait if you order this.  We waited for about 50 minutes.  3 super thick toast with ice cream and pieces of fresh mango on top and on the side.  The middle of the top 2 toasts were cut into cubes so it's easier to eat.  All goes well together.  At $15 you would think this is overpriced but this is definitely needed for sharing with 3-4 people (comes out to $4-5/ person).  Rating: 4/5  Fresh kiwi slush ($6.99):  Okay.  Nothing amazing.  Rating: 3/5"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant because I wanted to try the Mango Special Golden Toast. Knowing that it takes a long time to prepare (menu says 30 minutes), I ordered it right away after I got seated. I told the waitress that I want it right away...not after food items.  The little ordering ticket even said \"serve first\". I patiently waited (not just for my dessert but all food took a long time to be served). When I finally saw the Mango Golden Toast came out, the waitress took it to another table which clearly came after me. By this time, I have already waited 50 minutes.  the waitress didn't apologize or admit her mistake and just said it will be a few more minutes.  That's awful!!!! It doesn't matter what the food tasted anymore. The experience was awful. The service is bad. The food took a super long time and the restaurant wasn't even full. I am definitely not going back again!!!"}
{"text":"Food was not good to say the least. Waited for \"non shared\" table, only to be seated in a table smaller than the non shared. We ordered the lamb satay hotplate, it was as if lamb was the garnish for giant onions slices (there was so much onions and they were cut to the size of watermelon slices). Second item was popcorn chicken, which looked more like fish sticks or chicken fingers. However, taste-wise was what you expect from Taiwanese pop corn chicken. Third item was pork ramen; broth was overly salty, soup was luke warm, and the pork had giant pieces of fatcap. Last item was the mango pancake, which we specifically asked to be served after our meal, the server agreed. Regretfully, it came before the lamb dish, so if it was supposed to be served cold, it was room temperature by the time we ate it. Because we were sharing, we asked for a small bowl, the server acknowledged our order and never came back. Overall the experience was bad and I'll never visit again, nor will I recommend this place to someone I care about."}
{"text":"Ordered the crepe one time, and this time the mango pancake. Both were mediocre at best. Unfortunately though I love one of the servers, I don't think I'd come back for the food.  Tip your waitress."}
{"text":"Probably the cuties restaurant of this type, very unique and stylish. I like their special folk, spoon and menu. However the restaurant is not that spacious, you will always need to wait in queue if you come during peak hours. And just a small table for two people. The dishes here are good. But I would recommend their dessert. Actually in Chinese translation of their name is more like a dessert house. Their dessert is not very sweet compared to others. When I say \"not very sweet\", I mean \"reasonable sweetness\". Every time when I come here, I see many people order ice creams. Considering the size of their ice cream, I haven't tried it yet. But from what I tried, they serve pretty good desserts. And I'm gonna try the \"huge ice cream\" next time"}
{"text":"First time here. Came for dinner and had the minced pork on rice Taiwanese style. Was very disappointed with it. It was tasteless and bland. Will never order it again. My friend the pork neck on rice. It was interesting as it came out in a sizzling hot plate.  Again, I tried the pork neck and it was bland. Had a nice crunch to it but needs to be more seasoned. Might come back just to try the desserts. The brick toast dessert looks very interesting.  Service was nothing special. The wait staff didn't really talk and didn't refill our water unless asked."}
{"text":"Came here to try since my Instagram was flooded with people raving about the huge dessert tower. I have to say I was very disappointed. The decor was nice and the utensils were very cute like a pitch fork and shovel but that's all I liked. I had the pork cutlet curry and the portion was small, the curry was like spicy water and the rice inside was too mushy. The other stone bowl rice dish was also too mushy. Since, we weren't impressed, we left without trying their dessert. Hopefully, the quality of the food will improve."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times - lunch and dinner. It's less busy during lunch.   We came in for dinner around 9. We've been waiting over 20 mins while there are 2 empty tables but because we are only 4 and the tables can seat a max. of 7 - they are unwilling to seat us. I find this kind of silly because they're just hoping/waiting on a large group of patrons that may not actually come while the customers they already do have are leaving because of the wait time. They're known for their golden French Toast desserts. I've never ordered and can not comment but have had their ramen and bimbimbap which is not bad. They offer Japanese and Korean dishes as well as a variety of Chinese desserts and fruity drinks. I give it three stars because the food is not bad and the service is inconsistent - some seem to have more experience and are attentive while others have their head in the clouds."}
{"text":"Ive been to this place so many times with my bf. Chicken karage is really good. Curry dishes used to be good but their portion shrinked recently. Surprisingly their ramen was actually very good. Even though its not their specialty, their ramen broth was very rich and flavorful. Overall, if you feel like Japanese/Chinese style snacks and dessert, this place is okay."}
{"text":"I went here once with my boyfriend. It was cold that day so I decided to have a bowl of Japanese's ramen. I ordered the pork slices with just the regular soup. I was so hungry at that night but I still couldn't eat that \" ramen \" It was way too salty. I couldn't have any soup of it. I tried to finished all the 4 pork's slices because it costed $10.95 for that little bowl. I dont know if I gonna come back or not cuz someone told me their desserts were good ( I didn't have desserts that night so I cant tell anything)"}
{"text":"My first time here and it will probably be my last. The food was way below my expectations. The cutlery was extremely uncomfortable to use.  Curry pork chop omurice - The pork chop was extremely dry and tough. The curry is not spicy at all.  Beef tongue teppanyaki - Not bad, but way too much oil.  Smoked duck teppanyaki - The duck was placed beneath the spaghetti, making the duck extremely overcooked. The duck was actually so dry it curled up."}
{"text":"Great food and desserts, but you gotta be willing to wait over 40 minutes...Maybe even an hour. lol. Been here once and haven't been back. There's other places with good food and doesn't take nearly as long!"}
{"text":"I've always seen pictures of the iconic marshmallow toast at a bunch of different dessert places. I finally tried it at Petit Potato! And... I was pretty disappointed. It's dessert is toast with condensed milk and 9 marshmallows toasted on top.   The marshmallows don't stay on the toast really well so they fall off/get stuck together when you try to eat them. It wasn't very gooey or creamy as you'd expect, and it gets cold really really quickly. So by the time I got my dessert, it was pretty cold. The staff at Petit Potato were actually really accommodating to this and gave me a new one (warm this time) which was nice.   Overall, the ambiance and the staff were great- but the marshmallow toast was below average."}
{"text":"Decor of the restaurant is really cute and cozy. The menu is a little impractical but I love how there are so many pictures.  I find the prices a little high for the quality and quantity of food. I've only gone due to convenience of location. However, parking is crazy. I recommend parking upstairs."}
{"text":"The utensils are extremely  cute being a shovel spoon and a pitch fork.  The food however, I am not a fan of. The ingredients did not seem fresh, my mango dessert was still frozen. The tiger shrimp in my pasta was extremely rubbery.  If you're here for just bubble tea I'd say its pretty Gucci, if you're here for food then i wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"The wait time is awful. I would have given this place a higher rating because the food was pretty decent -- I ordered the sizzling beef ribs and shared the strawberry toast dessert, but it was an absolute pain having to get the server's attention to ask about our food. The ribs were flavourful and delicious. The strawberry toast was massive and I did enjoy it but not enough to have waited over an hour for it.  Place is definitely understaffed and they need to prepare some of the desserts in advance."}
{"text":"Very packed and slightly overpriced for even the regular Chinese desserts - $6.99 for a typical hot Chinese dessert. I don't recommend coming here unless you're ready to dish out for their special toast towers.  Petit Potatoe is pretty good packed despite having lots of tables.  Since they are so busy some of their tables are placed awkwardly with everyone waiting/walking around you and halfway into the walkway.  If you are lucky enough to get a decent table, their menu is pretty extensive with a wide range of drinks and desserts. As mentioned earlier, their typical desserts are more pricey than usual. Otherwise, their special items, like the toast tower, is worth a try (though it's at a hefty $16) perhaps with some friends.  The menu and staff do warn that there's a 20 min wait time but our tower comes in about 10 mins.   Not a bad place to eat dessert but since it's so packed, don't expect to be seated for a long time."}
{"text":"Kitchen 31 changed names and got a renovation!!!!   But did it for the better! Their utensils are so cute and the menu are much more clear with big pictures and less items to confuse yourself with.   I find that their menu is a combination of a few restaurants I've been to. Like their desserts are a mix of their own and also the hot plate beef restaurant at First Markham Place. They have the same dessert too. (Almost like a copy)  But overall, I enjoyed the food, service, surroundings. Parking may be limited. They are open late too. Food is A-ok."}
{"text":"Super good food?! I am legit stuffed. I usually never order dessert but the tall toast tower is so good. Must try it."}
{"text":"What a cute hang out spot! And can we talk about their utensils?! Miniature pitchforks and shovels, as utensils. I need this in my life.   We came in a group on a weekday, and man, they were busy. I can only imagine how hectic and long the wait would be, during the weekend.   We ordered a couple items - both sweet and savoury.  Namely, their Mango Golden Toast! There was a 30 minute wait, but we found it to be well worth it.  Between the 5 of us, we completely destroyed it within 5 minutes.  It was nice and buttery, did not resemble dry toast like some places.  Their shaved ice dessert was 'okay', and at half the portion compared to Cha Me Cha.   Although they were busy, service was good. Great atmosphere to hang out, and tastefully decorated. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Petit Potato really tries to be a trendy fusion restaurant that caters towards the young crowd. The drinks here are pretty good, and the bubble tea is made well without being too sweet. They have wintermelon flavor, which is my favorite! Food is hit or miss. The HK rice noodle roll was super yummy, but the fried tofu w/ satay that we tried was completely tasteless and hard to finish.  Overall, this place functions more as a hangout spot more than a food spot. The decor is very modern with an elevated bar area in the middle and sunken booth seating."}
{"text":"Overpriced and below average food. Wide variety of menu dishes to choose from, and generally cute decor. This is a good place to hang out with friends but most definitely not for foodies."}
{"text":"One of the most cutest Asian theme cafeteria style. There are occasional benches but if you're the lucky ones, you get the booth. It is a Taiwanese style food. They have popcorn chicken, sizzling plates and different drink selections. Their cutlery is adorable since they are a shovel spoon and a miniature pitch fork. Honestly do not try to eat the toast by yourself! It's definitely not a one person dessert! Overall 4/5"}
{"text":"What is the \"Special French honey golden toast\"and why are there Facebook videos spamming my news feed about it? Read on and find out.  The \"petit potato\" use to be known as \"31 kitchen\".  I was a regular for many years and quite enjoyed their Chinese desserts. My friends and I could have a bowl of braised beef noodles, fruit topped sago, and a bubble tea, while enjoying conversation or a small board game.  The manager would recognize us, make small talk and he made us feel welcomed. Their food was never anything remarkable but it was good enough for us to come back.  Ever since they renovated things have drastically changed. Food quality has sunk below \"nothing remarkable\" to below food court quality. Their decor is nice except they forgot to renovate their washrooms. We were scolded for playing games on an empty weekday night by the same manger. But hey, they have fancy impractical menus bolted to large wooden planks, featuring the \"Special French honey golden toast\".   The aforementioned toast is anything but special. For $15 you get 3 burnt stale dried pieces of toast topped with one scoop of ice cream and half a can of whipped cream.  It comes with a shockingly little amount of fruit for the price and takes 30 min to prepare. Thirty minutes for burnt stale toast? My friend literally choked on the crumbs of toast that evaporated down her wind pipe. I tried eating it with a knife and fork but I was afraid that the crust would warp their utensils, which for some reason, are shaped like farm tools. Seriously, their spoons look like little shovels. Which is appropriate I suppose; they can be used to dig a grave for the good times I had at 31 kitchen (RIP). This place is small potatoes and wouldn't recommend it to anyone ... Unless they want burnt toast."}
{"text":"We came here cause the chef managed to combine heart attack and diabetes into one giant sweetness overloaded french toast tower. For $15 you too can order that monster. We had different french toast flavours (berries and oreos) and every time we couldn't finish it (party of two and four). It was too sweet. The french toast was delish tho, wish I could just order that. It was also fun trying to play jenga with the toast, seriously its massive (yo mama joke here).  The food was terrible. Bland. Not recommending. Service is mixed, fast and slow. The place also fills up quickly but good thing they do take reservation. Good place for team bonding.  Note: Bring your man on his cheat day to get the most out of yo money."}
{"text":"I've been here before they renovated and I'll base my review on my recent visit. The food isn't that bad and it isn't that good. It's just average.  I came here for lunch and my party ordered: Omurice with pork curry sauce and slice beef pepper rice which came with an option of a drink which we just chose the cold honey green tea. The tea was not too sweet which was good.  I don't really understand why they print out your order like a receipt from the computer and leave it on your table. The employees never touched it or even look at it or even cross out the items listed that came. Weird.  The slice beef pepper rice came first. I definitely had tried better ones in Hong Kong. This one isn't that bad as they do re-create it well except for the soy sauce mix that comes with it? Soy sauce does general make you thirsty as I thought they gave you too much of the sauce which I didn't use up.  The omurice with pork curry sauce on the side is average. The pork katsu was not tender.   After eating lunch, of course, we had to try a brick toast and we ordered K01 which was the marshmallow brick toast. It took a little time for it to arrive but upon arrival, it was picture worthy. I thought this was the best dish out of meal as it was not as sweet as I imagine it to be. The melted marshmallow didn't overkill the brick toast and this combination works. I heard from a family member that the other massive brick toasts looks appealing but they aren't as good as they look.  This place is just average in terms of food. Would I come again? Probably if there is no lineup."}
{"text":"Came here a while back after an intensive game of volleyball.   Pretty busy on a Friday night, so best to maybe come early or make reservations.   Interior is very nice, bright and warm.  Service was good and they try the best to accommodate your needs.   Ordered Eel omurice with teriyaki sauce. This dish is not too fusion, with most of the japanese ingredients and style in place.  Portion seemed a little small when i first looked at it, but it was enough to fill me (especially after all the cardio workout!).  The rice, eel and egg was very good. loved the combination. but i found the terkiyaki sauce a bit too sweet for my tasting. nonetheless, teriyaki sauce never fails on anything, so it was overall alright.   They have desserts that i saw which should be pretty good and perfect if you are coming with a few friends to catch up and chit chat."}
{"text":"Had a worse experience in this place. We ordered 3 meals and a dessert, but one of the meal were not ready after my siblings finished their meal. I think they did not make the other one. So we cancelled the order and just wait for the dessert. We asked for the strawberry one, but they asked us to get mango instead. And we said no. It was my first time paying my meal without at least $.01 tip in my whole life in a restaurant. It's better to have meals in their next door, either sushi legend or congee wong. The portion and the price are more logic than petit potato."}
{"text":"The food here was okay. I've been here twice. The first time I came here, we came right when it opened - it only took around half an hour for the restaurant to fill up but it took well over an hour for the food to come out. Not just for us - but seemingly for everyone. Perhaps the cooks hadn't made it in yet, perhaps the food wasn't ready - we don't know, we weren't given an answer even after we asked the waiter twice, we were told the food would come soon.  Regardless, we had ordered an omurice, ramen and a sizzling plate. Now, I'm not a fan of ramen but I actually quite enjoyed it - I might've had long expectations and I was starving from the wait, but I really enjoyed the broth. The noodles and meat weren't anything memorable but the broth really drew me in. The omurice was bland, with all the hype around this type of dish, it wasn't worth ordering and the sizzling plate was nothing special. If I went back for a meal, I would order the ramen again, but I truly didnt think anything was too great. Not worth going out of my way for.  I came back once for dessert - as I had never tried their desserts before. Before they were petit potato, I believe this was called The Sugar and I used to come here for dessert all the time - one of our go to was the fried milk. So I figured I would try the fried milk again, unfortunately it was disappointing. The fried milk at petit potato kind of has a teriyaki like fried batter on it that can be rolled in sugar prior to eating. Unfortunately, the batter didnt' fit the dish and it wasn't impressive. We also ordered a huge brick toast - which is seemingly what they're famous for. I will give them credit in that it looks exactly like what it is and it is gorgeous when staring at it. It literally just tastes like bread and cream. As it should, because that's what it is. But the amount of bread is overwhelming and unless you really enjoy a carb-y dessert, I don't feel like it's overly worth it."}
{"text":"Dropped in for dessert o a Friday night and the house was packed, so I was hopeful about the quality and variety of options. The wait wasn't bad even for a table of 5, but we didn't really see much turnover while we were there so be ready to wait if you're coming right after dinner (8pm?) and late night (after 11pm). They're open until 2am, which is perfect as many other locations further north close before midnight. The atmosphere is fairly modern with a little bit of hipster, well lit and spacious. Everything looks very clean and many are enamoured by the garden tool shaped eating utensils.   The menu has something for everyone, from some omurice and ramen bowls to stacked toast mountains (Special Golden Toast), shaved ice, and traditional dessert soups. There's also a large variety of teas, juices, and slushies to choose from. My group went with a shaved ice, a strawberry toast mountain, and two rice ball (tong yuen) bowls.  The tong yuen bowls were acceptable, they have a good variety of flavours but some of them are not round nor filled, which was unclear from the description in English and Chinese. The sweet potato, taro, and some other flavour ones are just dough, and they were still shaped like rectangular lumps in my bowl. The black sesame rice balls are filled, and were very chewy but not too sticky. Overall the rice ball texture was good, the flavours were not apparent, and I had no complaints. The black sugar syrup and tofu fa served as a good base, sweet and still tasty, though the tofu fa comes very broken up. There were also peanuts in the bowl, so allergies be warned.  The shaved ice is a large portion, but it was not flavourful at all. The side of tapioca jelly added texture, but the colour-to-flavour ratio was poor. For how purple it was, it sure didn't taste much like taro at all, mostly just ice.  Finally the Special Golden Toast, it is a huge stack of hollowed out thick toast - think three slices of Texas toast makes up one piece here - 3 of those drenched in ice cream, sweet cream, sauce, and marshmallows. It takes at least 30min to arrive, longer if it's busy, so be prepared to wait and be patient. Very impressive upon arrival, quite a bit to finish, and definitely sufficient to share among three to four individuals. It's not something you can take away, so be prepared to fill up on bread and cream. As to the taste, nothing special. I mean, they don't make the ice cream, the don't make the bread, they don't make the sweet cream or the marshmallows. Really all they do is compile it together and there's no synergistic flavour profile to speak of. It's fun to get with friends though, at least for aesthetics.   Overall I was not disappointed as the price equated to portion size well. However nothing stood out as something I most definitely need to return for, and I felt better of each item could be obtained elsewhere. I will revisit for the other food items, to see if there's something unexpected, but overall this will not be a top dessert place of choice."}
{"text":"Came to the plaza to get glasses at the Advanced Optical but walked around to find something to eat for lunch. At first we saw primarily desserts but they also served other hot meals so decided to try it. The atmosphere was nice and rustic and the utensils (a pitchfork and shovel spoon) was cute to eat dessert with. Husband ordered a spicy kimchi dish, I ordered a garlic oil ramen, and for dessert we had a fruit sago with coconut milk. The ramen was actually one of the best I've had surprisingly from a non ramen place (compared to Sansotei and Kinton). More meat and ingredients than ramen and the broth wasn't too salty. The kimchi satay dish was OK. It was more like a sweet and sour sauce and wasn't spicy. The dessert was good but perhaps the fruit made the sago slightly watered down in texture. I'd try coming back to try other desserts as it seems that's what their specialty is."}
{"text":"Kinda of disappointed of the service that I had to go through today.  I ordered their black glutinous with coconut milk. When the served brought it to the table he spilt the coconut milk and his hand was touching my spoon as well. I didn't mind that it spilled, I thought he was going to get me a new one due to that half the dessert was missing but he didn't he just like sorry and left it there on the table with the mess left there too.   All and all just just unimpressed with the service that was given to me. Maybe next time it will be better but I just have to see next time."}
{"text":"Visited this place for their dessert. They have an extensive food and dessert menu with many options. Upon arrival, we liked the Scandinavian interior design of the restaurant and how spacious it was.  We ordered the Golden Mango Roll, House special milk pudding and assorted sweet dumplings in coconut.  Golden Mango Roll - Before ordering, we asked the server what this was, he didn't really describe it well but because my friend loves to eat mango we ordered it. This dish was like a rice noodle roll (cheung fun), the rice noodle part was slightly coconut flavoured and the filling inside contained freshly sliced sweet mango pieces. We enjoyed this dish but the rice noodle part was a bit too thick, we ended up just eating the mango pieces.   House special milk pudding --Was okay, typical sweet milk pudding, Not overly sweet and came in several small pieces.  Assorted sweet dumplings in coconut - My favourite was the sesame one,  it has lots of filling in it which was nice."}
{"text":"Overall - 2.5/5.0  Dropped by this place as I was nearby for dinner. Have heard a lot of mixed reviews for this joint. Mostly good things out of food bloggers who were invited to the media tasting events and some not-so good things from actual customers.  Here are my quick thoughts on this place:  - Decor was nice and very welcoming. I do like the ambient lighting and pale wooden setting which gives it a homey feel.  - Had a grass jelly mix with various toppings served with coconut milk which was considered a 'safe' pick. It was a bit light on the coconut flavour.  - Tried their brick toast (not the massive one) as I wanted to confirm whether the toast itself was done right. Turned out to be an absolute fail. It was dry and not very toasty at all. It took almost 15-20 minutes for them to bring it out and that's after we reminded them about it.   For those who are itching to try the massive brick toast tower, I would advise you not to follow the hype. There are many other things out there that are both Instagram worthy and good tasting. This is not one of them.  Note: I saw one table only ordering it to take a few pictures and left the entire brick toast tower untouched (only eating the toppings). Please do not waste food like that!"}
{"text":"Location This plaza is well known for its restaurants, and perhaps supermarket too lols. Anyhow, parking is a nightmare (as with any Asian place) and I've seen accidents every time I come here. I have a little secret place where I usually park, but if I told you I would never be able to come again lols. Alternatively, you can park in their garage =)  Service I read in many reviews that their service sucks. I'm not sure, I felt like they were okay. They tended to my needs every time I had a request. To me, that's pretty good service in an Asian restaurant already. If you want someone who asks if you need a water refill, go somewhere else fancy lols.  Food/Prices I think it's extremely neat that they have shovels as their utensils, I'd say I give that a bonus point. Not only are they visually appealing, but they are actually easy to use (obviously not ergonomic-friendly). The restaurant is not jam-packed like most Asian places and I love sitting at the booth area. I felt that the place adopted an open concept and the lighting was perfect. Atmosphere and design - check please! The menu is unique in its own way, kind of like a wooden pizza paddle but pizza cannot be ordered here lol. I love how they have such a colourful menu but dude, things are a little expensive.  I've been here twice and I tried the ramen and the omelette rice. They are average at best. The omelette is soft, the taste is there, but definitely a little watered down. Their meat is okay, except the meat that was found in ramen was meh. There was way too much fat. The omelette rice is commonly known as omurice in Japan. I've had it in many places (including Japan) and I have to say, it's actually quite difficult to make this super yummy. The egg has to be made extremely soft for it to taste good, having mayo is a plus, and ketchup is a usual addition. I always find it fascinating to look at...and that's all lols. I've seen in YouTube videos how some look amazing, I've had yet to try one that has wowed me (even in Japan). I do wish to go back to Japan and try this dish again. As for the ramen, the soup base was super oily. It did taste good but the noodles weren't that special.  I did not have the stomach to try their famous tower-high brick toast, BUT I did try their marshmallow toast. It wasn't bad. It's a little difficult to cut into pieces because the marshmallow would melt right away and everything would be stuck together. Definitely messy, but the taste is there. Is it worth $5.99? Well, if you venture to Go For Tea the price is similar so I'd say it's comparable."}
{"text":"YAAAAASSSSS.   I guess, depending on when you go, it can be hit or miss. Both times that I went, I loved it!  So first off, the parking is a bit chaotic in this space. You may have to park further away from the restaurant. Both times, we came here after 8pm on a weekday and there were at least one or two prime parking spots available.   Yes, we ordered that monstrous toast tower. It was FILLING and we had to take it to go (toast still tasted great). I would recommend ordering it if you're with a group of 3 or more people. The two of us couldn't even finish half of it. We ordered the yam one (purple tower), but I would recommend the mango one. The yam, as pretty as it was, was kind of .. well.. yam-my and didn't pack a bunch of flavour. It also takes about 30 minutes, so while we waited we also ordered one of their cold jelly dishes (the one with grass jelly, red bean, taro balls, etc). It was ok, so perhaps try something else on their menu.. like the unagi omelette (YUM!) or their takoyaki (one of the best I've ever had).   I loved the interior design and the cute pitch fork/ spoon set. They don't take reservations for small parties, so just keep that in mind. Service can be a bit slow as well, but their unique menu and plentiful choices are worth checking out."}
{"text":"The restaurant had some really instagram worthy dessert  photos, so my friend and I decided to try out this place.   While Petit Potato does serve savory food, it's obvious that it's more well known for its dessert.   Savory food: we tried out the curry pork chop omurice.     It was very underwhelming.   Literally just rice wrapped in a thin egg omelette with somewhat tough pieces of fried pork chop and watered down curry.   I would not recommend this dish  Soup: to balance out the carbs, we decided to go for a Chinese soup with silken chicken, ginseng and conch.   It was not bad, albeit the size was very small.   For $10.75, I am sure they could have served a bit more.   Lastly the mountain of brick toast, ice cream, strawberries and marshmallows.  The wait took at least 35 minutes.   But we were warned by our waitress.   It's like a piece of art.   When it arrived on our Table, we were a bit flabbergasted at how we were going to attempt to split the portions up with it toppling over like Jenga.   The cool aspect of this dish is how they precut the toast for you, leaving you with a toasted frame and large bread crutons to dip into the ice cream. We found out that it's meant for 6 ppl.   Two people attempting to finish this dish is a dangerous challenge.   The wait staff is friendly.  But they had a tendency to have tunnel vision,  making the wait for utensils, water and the bill longer than necessary.   Overall, interesting place to try out some new instagram worthy dessert.   Just come with a large group of friends to share.   Or if you're a piggy, bring some insulin."}
{"text":"The environment is too bad, too noisy, not a good place for eating and chatting. The papaya isn't sweet at all. There is no lava in the lava cake. It wasn't a soft heart cake, it should be a hard heart cake. All in all, food is not as good as it should be. Environment is terrible. Go before thinking harder."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. Wife and I both ordered omurice, pork for her and eel for me.  We also got an order of the deep fried chicken soft bone.  We both thought the omurice was tasty but way too heavy and filling.  I found the deep fried chicken soft bone crispy but lacking in flavour, tasted more like old oil that hasn't been changed in a while.   Service was decent but nothing spectacular.  We got our table soon after we entered the restaurant.  There were several servers working so there wasn't much waiting time.  Food arrived quickly.  To end, decent service and average food."}
{"text":"I am an durian lover, tried at so many places in Toronto. So DO NOT order durian dessert at this shop, not worth with the price you pay for, thin thin 2 slices frozen durian ice folding over the dessert bowl, and charged $7.99, not like usual an big scoop type at other shops in Toronto. Disappointed!"}
{"text":"Alright alright alright. Petit potato is pretty swell. The staff is on point here. I've been here once before, and I asked for warm water rather than the usual cold water. This time, the waiter remembered my order and immediately gave me warm water right as I sat down.   Good service.   Today, I ordered a sliced pork ramen--and let me tell you--it was alright. Definitely not as good as other restaurants I've been to in Toronto or Montreal, but it was decent. Portion was good, broth was a little salty for my taste, and although the meat was tender, it didn't melt in my mouth.   I also had a condensed milk red bean slush, and it was in 1/2 liter glass, filled to the brim, and a good portion of red bean. It was served as cold as the most frigid of Montreal winters, and it wasn't too sweet.  Would definitely recommend. They played top 40 music, and it seems that the general age of the customers were from 20-35 years old.   Trendy, but not overbearingly so."}
{"text":"Went here for desserts on my birthday. The portions are huge, recommended sharing with another person. Atmosphere is busy and a bit loud, really cool place to chill and hang out with your friends. Great tasting deserts, there are quite a lot of creative ones. Would definitely come here again, quite affordable and reasonable wait time."}
{"text":"Adorable dessert place or to grab a bite to eat. The pear soup and hot plates are amazing. My bf and I come here when we're too lazy to cook. The staff is always nice and their utensils are way too cute."}
{"text":"I was actually super surprised coming here. I read the reviews on how it was overhyped, but it definately needs some love.   The food my group got was really good. We got some baked tofu, popcorn chicken and stove noodles. Everything was cooked perfectly and was really yummy. We were really surprsied how good the food was cause we thought they just emphasized more of the desserts.   The brick tower was fun to look at, and was OKAY. Wasn't amazing. Definately need to share.   The service was quick. The decor was fun and hipster. It does get a bit crowded and congested when there's a lot of people. The tables are really close to each other and all."}
{"text":"Tried the golden toast tonight with my friends tonight and it's AMAZING! The ice cream is soft, the toast is crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside. The portion is also satisfying. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Came here for a mid-afternoon sweet treat with our friends.  As we are still stuffed from lunch, we didn't get to try any savory items, though we definitely are interested to another day, as there are Korean items like bibimbap, Japanese omurice and ramen, and sizzling hot plates with very enticing aroma wafting from a nearby table.  We are too stuffed to try their signature toast mountain, so we picked a few random desserts to try.  No easy task as the dessert items take up half the menu, with items from crepe, turtle jelly, sago soup, milk pudding to shaved snow.  We eagerly dug in with our miniature spades and shovels when the desserts arrive.  The mango crepe has too much whipped cream and too little mango.  Turtle jelly with mango ice cream is not bad, the jelly not too strong which can be a plus or minus depending on your preference. The undisputed winner is the durian sago soup, which has a big chunk of durian in it and a very nice flavorful."}
{"text":"Saw BlogTo and many Instagram food blogger posted this ice cream toast! So I went with a bunch of friends and tried it! As it turned out, not soggy at all!!!! And neither was it too hard. Just the right amount of sauce with the toast. So yummy!!! Will come back for lunch or dinner to try out their teppanyaki rice and ramen. I read pretty good comments on Instagram"}
{"text":"Ordered matcha creama which was very strong in green tea flavor.  Also has the strawberry toast which was very large in portion but the toast is a bit too hard and dry."}
{"text":"Love their rice on hot plate and stuffed peppers. My go to place for some comfort food that's consistent in quality and taste. I've tried their desserts as well but they're generally not as good as their food. If you'd like to get your dessert after you finish your food you should ask for it specifically or else you'll get the dessert before you even get your meal. It may be hard to get the servers' attention but once you have their attention, they're very accommodating and nice."}
{"text":"Mountain of brick toast. NOT WORTH THE WAIT, initially, the quoted time was 30 min. Now I am an hour and 10 minutes in with them lying to me saying 10 more minutes every 10 min after 30 min mark.   Waiting for the brick toast is worse than going to the DMV waiting to renew my drivers licence. At least at the dmv you know it's a 2 hour wait time."}
{"text":"Love this place for lunch, drink and dessert. The lunch combo comes with the basic drink. You can also upgrade your drink with extra $2. They used to be much cheaper years ago though. For dessert, I am giving this place two thumbs up. Everything I tried are good."}
{"text":"The Eel Omurice with Teriyaki Sauce was a sight to behold with the eel fillet perching above the omurice (omelette wrapped around tomato fried rice).  The most important thing was that not only was it good looking but it tasted fantastic too.  I was especially hungry that day so I gobbled up my portion really quickly but it was actually truly delicious.  The omelette part was so smooth and fluffy -- just the way I like eating eggs.  The tomato fried rice was perfect in taste and texture and the saucy teriyaki meaty eel just perfected the dish.  I would totally come back to eat this again (and also to try their other toppings of omurice like the pork cutlet omurice hehe).  This special Mango Special Golden Toast dessert was indeed special and can definitely feed more than 2 or 3 people.  The thick toasts were cut out of their crusts and made into a tower foundation starting from the bottom to fill out each layer.  There were several mango chunks and lots of condensed milk and mango sauce that dripped beautifully and artfully from the top of the 'mountain' to the bottom where there was an overflow of sauce and ice cream -- a sphere of vanilla ice cream with some smaller mango chunks at the top too.  It was definitely beautiful and also tasted good!  I really enjoyed the chewy and soft thick toast that accompanied the dessert; it wasn't hard or dry at all and I really appreciated that. ^_^  I would totally order this again too and also try out their other flavours and the new flavours once they come out with them (Oreo, matcha, etc.)."}
{"text":"Visited Fri May 5 for dinner.  This place gets very busy.   Pros -  Interesting cute decor. They have a fairly large menu with colour photos of the food.  Satay ramen with kimch - Has a slight kick Mango sago - Sweet with fresh mangoes  Cons -  Build a dish (Salmon teppanyaki) - Good flavour for the first few bites, then I got sick of the taste/flavour. Way too much noodle and not enough veggies. Good amount of Salmon, but I had to flip  the fish on your own, since it's only partially cooked on one side. I would have wanted them to cook my food for me before it comes.  This dish comes on a sizzling plate, with a big paper warning circle \"This plate is 200 degrees celcius\". Kind of a scary warning right? It was hard to eat with the paper, so this should be removed.  Very busy parking lot at times.  Takes 30 min for them to make 1 dessert, nobody has time for that.  The toast tower desserts don't come in smaller portions, the desserts are meant to be shared with 4 people.  Protip - There are 4 booths on the right side that provide a more relaxed dining experience.   Damage - $31 before tip."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with delicious dinners and unique desserts. I like the steak or spicy curry pork cutlet omurice. They also have a steamed rice noodle roll with HK sauce that I just LOVE. And when they noticed we were half way done and there wasn't much sauce remaining they offered to get us more sauce free of charge. Sooo Good!! Oh man I was thinking about that dish alllll night. We've been here half a dozen times and always been served kindly."}
{"text":"Petit Potato is located in North Toronto. It is a fusion restaurant that serves various Asian dishes, but what you should really come here for is the desserts. They are known for the golden toast towers that can be shared between 2 to 4 people depending on your appetite. The golden toast towers are desserts inspired by similar desserts served in Hong Kong and Taiwan, but just more colourful.    The golden toast towers is a contrast of hot and cold; sweet and salty; and creamy and crispy all at once. Depending on the type of golden toast you order, the toast is a 10 inch mountain of brick-thick and well-browned white bread decorated with ice cream, syrup and fruits. I got the Mango Golden Toast which I would recommend."}
{"text":"So, I saw the hype of this joint so I was eager to try this place out. The decor was very nice and unique. We ordered their terriyaki eel on rice and egg and a ramen dish. Both were very delicious. The eel was a good piece that was served over a fluffy made omelette that wrapped steamed rice. The ramen in my opinion was pretty decent considering this place did not specialize in ramen noodles. We also ordered a lychee slush and kiwi juice. Both regular, nothing special. We then ordered the well talked about 10 inch high toast dessert. We ordered the Oreo flavoured which consisted of 3 thick toasts, a large scoop of oreo ice cream,  a white sauce drizzled all around and a pool of it at the bottom of the plate, and topped with colourful marshmallows, chocolate drizzle, and oreo biscuits without the cream in the middle (we think some one is assigned to hand pick off all the centres of the oreos haha). Anyway. the verdict? The ice cream was delicious! .....yup, $16 for a scoop of ice cream. I don't know what the hype is, perhaps it's a thing to have overcooked, dry toast with ice cream and sauce on it. If so, that's cool, just not my forte. I thought the toast consistency was going to be soft or similar to that of french toast. No, it was like a thick cracker. Perhaps they made it incorrectly? Other reviews can vouch for it but ours was made this way so I'm going to assume that this is how it's supposed to be made. And to top it all off, we found a piece of hair in it. Yes, about halfway through. Right in the sauce pool at the bottom of the plate. No worries though, they didn't charge us for it. And as I'm sure most reviews have stated already, it takes awhile for these desserts to make. The menu states 30 minutes. There were maybe 5 tables of people while we were there so I assumed it would take the 30 minutes like the menu said (some people have had to wait an hour so I read). But little did we know, they started the 30 minutes after we were done eating our meals which we did not know so we finished our meal and had to wait about 40 minutes after that for our dessert. We did not expect to spend that much time in this nicely decorated place. Final verdict: We'll come back for the food, not the desserts thanks."}
{"text":"Petit potato is known for their dessert toast mountain. It takes at least 30 min for them to prepare the dessert dish. It's worth the wait when you're with a group of people you're planning to share the toast with. Prices are fair compared to other Chinese desert based restaurants."}
{"text":"Truly a place of visual gastronomic pleasure. The food presentation is really interesting and unique. Unfortunately I was saddened to have not enjoyed my soggy ramen and the exceptionally sweet desserts and milk tea.   If you have a normal taste palate, you may want to order anything that is sweet, as 1/2 sweet. Again, unfortunately my milk tea didn't taste authentic. It tasted like a powder like instant mix.   Lastly, I'd be interested to know if one can order their ramen el dente, or soggy is their signature form?"}
{"text":"This place has beautiful decor but food is mediocre. I got the dessert with grass jelly, Mochi balls, peanuts and brown sugar. It was alright but I could not finish it. We also tried their steamed noodles and mango slush. The food did not wow us or anything, it's very average but this place is a good place to chat."}
{"text":"2.5 stars because if the small portions and the food quality.  We ordered the pork cutlet omurice with spicy curry sauce and takoyaki.  The pork cutlet omurice was quite small (see picture) and the pork cutlet was dry and not crispy and that's why you need the curry sauce.  The rice was not bad though.  The Takoyaki had 5 pieces.  The size of the octopus was small so it wasn't worth it.  On the plus side, their utensils were cute.  The fork and spoon looks like mini pitchforks and shovels.  I wouldn't go again if I had a choice."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and some deserts. Found the portion a little small for the price they were charging."}
{"text":"I shouldn't have ordered food at a dessert restaurant  =/  I ordered the Pork & Mui Choi Steamed with rice on the side. Portion is relatively small, but what can you expect for $9.99. I would've forgiven its size, except the pork was sooo fatty and oily. I know pork can be fatty, but it was equal parts fat and pork. Besides that, it was alright, very flavourful.  The shape of the spoon and fork are really cool! lol  After looking at other tables, I'll be back for dessert!"}
{"text":"Another favourite of the hubby and wifey... and their porkiebun who just enjoys the food here too.  This place offers a variety of sizzling plates. Hubby loves the one where you get to choose between rice with teriyaki sauce or pasta with tomato sauce as base. Meat options include eel, chicken, beef, and duck I believe, with extra $ to add other items like egg, corn etc. Wifey can't enough of their omurice... which is pretty much rice-stuffed omelette with meat on top and lathered with sauce. So delicious makes you want to order seconds!  This place also offers really affordable fruity drink options... $6ish for a huge one that can be shared by 2. And of course... their dessert! They have this massive crunchy toast tower that's swimming in ice cream and whipped cream with your choice of flavour (mango, blueberry, strawberry or Oreo). Definitely a must-try but needs to be shared at least by 3 people... or 2 people really starving for dessert XD"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant last year when it was called 31Kitchen, and I must say the new renovations look great- definitely makes the place look more modernized! I came here for dessert at around 10pm, and it was filled largely with young adults.   I ordered the sweet sesame soup, and my friend got the sweet 5 assorted dumplings with coconut milk, as well as black milk tea with tapioca. The food came out quite slowly. Her dessert came out 10 minutes after mine did; having waited so that we could eat together, mine inevitably became cold.   About the black sesame soup- I could barely taste the sesame flavour, seeing as it was so watered down and liquid-y (not nearly as viscous as it should be). So disappointing!  The 5 dumpling flavours were: green tea custard, taro, chocolate, sesame, and mango. They had a lot of filling in them, and were full of flavour! My favourite was the chocolate one.  And just when you think you can't go wrong with original milk black tea, the drink was very bland and diluted. Unfortunately, the tapioca was also quite mushy.  Dessert here is definitely not up to par, and I'm unlikely to return."}
{"text":"Ordered their omurice because I've been trying to find one with similar flavours as that in Japan.  We ordered the tonkatsu omurice and eel omurice.   The curry was ok. A bit on the saltier side yet not that flavourful if you know what I mean. The tonkatsu was rather small and disappointing too as it wasn't crispy and a bit dry. The egg however was nice and smooth and paired well with the curry. The rice was mushroom fried rice and had a lot of mushroom flavour, but it felt more like canned mushrooms rather than fresh.   My friend ordered the eel so I didn't really taste it. The sauce was good but comparable to the ones you buy at the grocery store. The eel looked decent size.   Was still hungry after so ordered their rice noodle app. Simple and although nothing special, it gave the taste you would typically enjoy from this dish. The sauces were balanced and the noodle rolls were soft and smooth.   Overall there was nothing special from this meal. A little on the expensive side too but the flavours were ok."}
{"text":"When the waiter warns you about how big their desserts are, you should listen to them. Unfortunately my friends and I didn't and we had to eat an egregious amount of toast, cream, and ice cream. While it was delicious, it was too much to handle once we got to our second toast. One of their toast desserts is enough for 3 people to share!   Service was average, they got my order wrong, but they did make an effort to provide us with a receipt of all our orders before actually preparing the dishes so make sure you check that they've got all the items right!  The menu skews heavily towards dessert items. Their entrees and appetizers were underwhelming in comparison. I would recommend just coming here for dessert as there are so many lunch/dinner options nearby.   Prices are reasonable though and the atmosphere is quite nice, so give it a try if you're craving something sweet."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times it was for dinner. The first time I arrived at about 6pm and the restaurant was 3/4 full. we were seated right away at a long table. The menus were on wooden cutting boards which was cute lol. To order, you would write down the code that corresponds to what you want onto a piece of paper and then give it to the server. They give you lemon water here and I didn't know and thought there was something in my drink... I even waved a server down and told her there was something in my water. She was about to go exchange it but then looked into the cup and told me that it was lemon. Oops my bad lol.  I ordered curry omurice with pork cutlet while my partner ordered sizzling chicken with rice. Surprisingly, the sizzling chicken was a very generous portion, my bf had to ask for an extra bowl of rice because there was so much chicken. My omurice was good, the curry was a little bit thicker than I expected but tasted good nonetheless. The curry and pork cutlet tasted like your standard every day curry and pork cutlet, so while it tasted good, it wasn't really anything special.   My experience here was a pleasant one and I would definitely come back to try other things on the menu, especially the dessert."}
{"text":"Went to this place on a sunday afternoon. and was actually expecting a decent place to grab a bite and desert with group of 11 friends. When i arrived at this place. it was half empty as it was around 4:00pm at the time. so originally the service was ridiculous they wanted to shove 11 of us in a 7 person table, simply because they want to save tables for other customers. i immediately demanded that they find proper seating and if i did not insist they would've tried to shove us all in.   They ended up putting us in 2 tables.  that part was already pretty bad. but was looking forward to ordering their widely advertised toast tower desert. since i've tried it at a lot of location as wondering how well they did theirs. we ordered some food as a group, and then desert as well.  Than they came and said to us that they \"ran out of toast\" at 5:00pm before the start of dinner service, they had already run out of their signature toast desert. which i think means they are just ridiculous. That was not the worst part.; this place seems to want to reach a new level of bad.   The food we ordered, when it did arrive, all of it was bad for various very basic reason. A friend ordered the duck hot plate rice, the rice was under cooked and was hard as rock. another ordered popcorn chicken with ramen, which somehow became tasteless. Another friend ordered basil chicken, where they had no basil and no flavor that she had to ask for salt. and i ordered a curry pork katsu omurice, which was a whole new level of bad. The curry was basically curry water, no texture no flavor, the pork katsu breaded was wrong, the pork was overcooked, and the breaded fell apart the minute you grab it. the rice in the omurice was also under cooked. it really takes a monumental type of failure to reach this level of bad. it seems the people there don't know how to cook anything.   I would avoid this place like the plague, the chef's can't cook period, service is not good, and overall just a terrible terrible restaurant. it amazes me they can be bad at almost every variety of dishes they have on the menu.  seeing the positive reviews around for the regular food, i have doubt on whether those people actually know what good food taste like"}
{"text":"Was really excited to go here but it was ultimately a disappointment. I see why people like the place - it's very cute and stylish, and I LOVE the outlets and lights in the booths. That said, it's expensive for what it is. I didn't see many drinks under $5 and they all looked like overly sugary concoctions - for that price, I'd rather go to the Chatime in the same plaza and get something made with custom ice and sweetness. Many of the appetizers were in the $6-$9 range.  I did go with one other person and I'm glad - I feel like going alone would have been a mistake because it means no sharing, and the small plates looked like the best bets. Two people also probably couldn't demolish one of those toast towers. Unfortunately, neither of us was hungry enough for apps, so we ended up with two main dishes and one dessert. I got the shrimp fettucine alfredo and felt that although it was presented well and the shrimp was good quality (and quantity), the sauce was fairly tasteless and weak and I didn't feel the hot plate added anything.  The dessert was better - fresh fruit with coconut milk and sago. It was a good size for the price, the fruit was indeed fresh and good quality, and the amount of fruit and sago was respectable. I did get to try my dining partner's dish - another teppan pasta, the sliced beef fettucine with black pepper - and I didn't like it at all. I thought it was smoky and found the flavor off-putting.  I'm glad I tried it, but it's not worth a second visit."}
{"text":"Very tight seating as they try to cram as many tables into the restaurant to maximize seating. Understandable as there always seems to be a line. I think this place is mainly popular because of the aesthetics and how instagrammable the food is. The menu didn't really appeal to me though. I think the food and overall experience was not worth the price I paid. We ordered the eel bibimbap and there was only two small square of eel for the entire bowl of rice. Not that the food tasted bad, I liked the sauce they served on the side, which went well with the rice. We also ordered a omurice egg omelette curry rice with fried pork cutlet. The egg was nice and fluffy, the best thing on the plate. The pork cutlet was dry and over cooked. We also ordered a fruit ice tea which had a lot of fruits but was so artificially sweet, we had to mix water to enjoy the drink. Overall I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"This must be the absolute worst dessert place I've been to. Can't even make toast with icecream done in ONE HOUR AND 30 MINUTES. By then I had no choice but to cancel my order. Menu says waittime is 30 minutes. I give them an extra hour to get it done and they still fail to meet the finish line.   At 1 hour, I asked if it's done yet. The waiter goes to the kitchen and comes back saying \"its ready! Just needs to be built into the tower. Another 8-10 minutes.\"  First of all, I truly do not believe it takes 8-10 minutes to stack bread and icecream together.   SECOND OF ALL, IT STILL DIDNT EVEN COME AFTER 10 mins.   Like I mentioned above, I waited a total of 1 hour and 30 minutes and still nothing came. Extremely disappointed with this place and will never be returning.   On top of all this they didn't have the decency to say they're sorry or offer a discount for their poor management."}
{"text":"Walked out without ordering anything   Tried to seat us in the middle of a group then when I said no they sat us next to other folk on a small table .... the place wasn't busy at all plenty of booths available and then the next people that came in were seated at a booth..... we heard them and they hadn't booked this table specially  It annoys me when they try give poor seating so ..... they ain't getting my money."}
{"text":"I've come here many many times and decided it was finally to leave a review. Usually their food quality is pretty consistent and consistently good, though I have had caught them on a bad day.   We usually get their beef omurice and pasta teppan. Beef omurice is always good and can never go wrong with it. The teppan is variable depending on what meat you get. Duck breast, salmon and shrimp are good.   Desserts wise, their mountain toast are good in all flavors. Their mango roll is awesome! Ask for it to be fridges before serving and it'll taste even better!  I love this place but it's usually packed at nighttime so either go later at night past 7:30 or make a reservation.   Super cute eating utensils as well :D"}
{"text":"We came to try it again after it done the renovation. There's more seats and get proper placement. Of course the interior space gets really well design compare to before. We ordered the dessert. It's called five assorted dumplings with coconut milk. The filling inside each dumpling is pretty amazing!! They have from typical black sesame paste to  chocolate, mango, green tea and taro. It's like open the Christmas gift you never know what type of fillings you get from the dumplings!! That was a really fun night especially on Tuesday after work!"}
{"text":"After last time's dessert disappointment, I came back late on a Friday night to try some of their hot food out. I ordered the pork tenderous rib ramen ($10.50 ish). The tenderous ribs were actually tender. I can count on one hand the number of places that get it so those ribs become gelatinous. This is one of them. Good job! The broth, while being a milky color, was more on the soy side of things than tonkotsu, I found (not that this was specified anywhere, nor was there an option). The egg was softboiled, but also a soy sauce egg. I wouldn't mind coming for another bowl of ramen, but it also isn't something I would crave.   Side note. Two members of our group had their teppan style rices. The amount of meat per order for those dishes is significantly lacking."}
{"text":"I came here after a game of capture the flag with a smaller group. When we got there, we were seated in an odd table cuz we had 11 ppl. We ended up splitting into 2 tables beside each other. The place was not full but their seating arrangement skills could improve.  I ordered the duck with rice on the sizzling plate.it looked good and had the aroma. I thought it was ok but was still hungry by the end of the meal. Others who ordered similar dishes thought the rice was undercooked but I didn't find the same thing.   Not sure if I will return until they fix some stuff including the service and food. It was chosen by a friend who saw it was a new place. The only place was a dessert place which this new one still offered but with a twist. Didn't feel like dessert as I'm not a big fan of toast with mango. It looked big but the price point seemed a bit steep."}
{"text":"The decor of the restaurant is pretty stylish for Asian restaurant.   They have a lot of selections - dessert, hot food, drinks and even hot plates (rice, meat and vegetables on a hot iron dish).   Ordered the kiwi Apple slush drink with steamed egg with ginger dessert. The kiwi Apple slush is a bit on the sweet side - the Apple is from syrup and used fresh kiwi.   The steam egg with ginger was meh. I had better.  Seems like the dessert with the toasts are popular - should have ordered one instead.   The ambiance is noisy and crowded - hard to hear each other.  And the spaces between the tables - cannot walk between the tables without hitting food or drink or someone else."}
{"text":"We went here for desserts and it was good. The place was quite busy on a Sunday night but the overall experience was good. I might return to check out their meals.  Food: 3/5, we got the massive mango toast, taro toast and corn cheese toast.  I'll say that the massive mango thing is good enough for 4 people.  It was more aesthetically pleasing vs the taste. The taro toast was delicious and the corn cheese was lacklustre.  Service: 2/5, im not sure if it's because they were so busy but not much service going on other than bringing your food.  Ambience: 2/5, very nice and simple decor with comfortable seating. You are however sitting really close to everybody and it does get quite loud.  Not sure if it's the best spot for conversations.  Price: 2/5, slightly overpriced but it's not too bad to try out something different.  About $15 per person"}
{"text":"They basically renovated the previous restaurant and renamed it.. The food got so much better though. Before all the desserts were very water down with no taste.. I think they finally stepped up their game! Ramen was pretty good as well. Come try it out :)"}
{"text":"Food: 3/5 Service: 4/5  Had dessert on a Sunday mid-afternoon.  Got a table immediately.  Food came out quick.  Massive menu - too many items to choose from.   We had: - Fresh Mango & Grass Jelly in Coconut Milk - 2/5 - small portion, tasted bland, wouldn't get again - Fresh Mango Snowflake - 3/5 - large portion, good for 2 people, the diced mango was not ripe enough - Honey Green Tea Creama - 3/5 - small glass, interesting flavour but wouldn't get again due to price   Decor is very nice, clean, and inviting.  The manager was also very nice and accommodating which is rare at Chinese establishments.  He actually seems like he enjoys his job.  I would return again to try their other food items."}
{"text":"Petit Potato is stuck in an absolute hell on earth parking lot and it makes me want to die, just a little bit. It takes approximately 48 years to find a spot here and I'm lowkey not okay with that.. it's because it's all restaurants and the chinese supermarket.  The service is not great, they're not friendly and made eye contact with me 3 times before asking how many people I had - it's like he was hoping for someone else to take care of me so he wouldn't have to. They seemed quite fed up with any of our questions too.. it was a bad vibe but who knows? Bad day? For everyone????  The food makes up for it a bit. They have teppan which looks hella good, except no veggie options but I like that you can add corn, mushrooms and extra shit into your teppan if you don't want to have just the basics (because you're already basic enough, ya feel?) I had the veggie bibambap and hollyyyyy, it was delicious. Sooo many veggies packed to the brim of the stone pot, and the bottom crisped the rice to perfection, which is what I love in a dolsot bibambap.  Friend had the steak omurice, which she found mouthgasmic. My other friend had the pork intestine and she said it was good at the time but her stomach hurt shortly after.   The toast tower is also ridiculous. Definitely give that a try if you can."}
{"text":"Came here on September 10 for dinner and dessert. I called in advance to reverse a seat for 7 and they were quite accommodating, they reversed the table until we arrived. However they didn't ask for a name or phone number so perhaps they weren't too busy.  I ordered the omurice with black pepper sauce and steak. The rest of my group ordered omurices with pork cutlets in spicy curry sauce and non spicy sauce. Durian Pancake. Pepper lunch style dishes in: beef and rice, and smoked duck beast in tomato sauce with pasta. Grass jelly with mango ice cream and lastly taro brick toast.   My omurice the steak although it looked like it was cooked to medium, the texture was overcooked and very chewy. The sauce was Meh, there was the black pepper flavour however it didn't enhance the flavour of the dish. The dish was salty it was kind of lacklustre.  The Durian pancake had a very strong durian smell and you can see the durian pieces when you cut open the pancake. I did not taste it because I don't really enjoy durian. My friend said it was overselling with whip cream but the presentation and wrapping was on point.  The pepper lunch style dishes:  The smoked duck smelt really good. However the duck pieces were cut so thinly that it becomes over cooked really fast on the hotplate. And before you know it you're eating pepperoni.  The beef and rice, aka teppan is better.  All-in-all, it was okay. Maybe I'll come back if I'm in the area and there's nothing else to eat but I don't think I'll ever had a sense of 'craving' this place."}
{"text":"A popular dessert café located in the Leslie/Finch plaza. Came here with a few friends after volleyball drop-in. There is usually very limited parking in this plaza because it is often quite busy. It wasn't too busy when we arrived and was able to get a table for 5. They have quite the extensive menu here with lots of different savoury dishes, desserts and drinks. This made it really hard for me to choose something as everything in the pictures look so good!! I was feeling hungry so decided to order something savoury so I ordered the pork cutlet omurice with black pepper sauce. Basically, this dish is an omelette filled with rice. It was pretty good- pork cutlet was fried nicely and the sauce was delicious. It was well seasoned. Personally I don't think it's worth $12.99 so I definitely felt it was cheaper.  I also ordered the mango green tea with tapioca- it was good but nothing too special about their bubble tea.   The food was alright and the sauce was delicious. Service was pretty good that day and it was surprisingly busy on a Thursday evening. Our waiter was pretty attentive in refilling our waters and getting our food to us in a timely manner.  Overall, it was a good dining experience and will be back when I'm craving desserts. This is a great place to socialize, have a dessert/drink or even study here as some students bring laptops to work here."}
{"text":"I first heard of petit potato from their crazy looking toast desserts and made a visit with some friends to try this place out. The good news is that their food options are also pretty good and this place can be a good option for both food and desserts which is starting to become the trend for a lot of restaurants.  For the appetizers, we started off with the rolled rice noodles which were served with hoisin sauce and sesame sauce. It was a great snack to share, and it was  perfectly bite sized. Next up was the fried chicken knuckles which was served with some mayo. If you love tendons and cartilage then get this. There's a fantastic snap along with light crispyness of the coating. For the main course I went with the eel omurice which was fantastic.  I highly recommend this if you're a fan of eel. The rice and the egg were perfectly cooked and worked so well together and the sweet sauce here really made the dish. It isn't your typical unagi sauce which is a tad darker tasting. There's also a sizable amount of nori flakes which also contributes to the dish. The portion size is adequate and you'll have no problem getting filled up!  Dessert was a tad more disappointing experience, we didn't go for the overkill monster toasts but rather opted for a marshmallow toast which was really underwhelming. There was really nothing to it, you're better off trying to make this at home. We also got a durian pancake which was alright. It was a pocket where the pancake was durian flavoured and was wrapped around some whipped cream. It was light and fluffy but didn't offer much apart from that. I was told the pancake was supposed to be smaller in size"}
{"text":"Went for the brick toast tower dessert. I loved how it was done and I think it's brilliant idea! But why 3 stars? Well, inside the contents could've been more creative. :("}
{"text":"The food is pretty good - bibimbap much better than anticipated. The toast dessert is not bad at all but you're start to feel full to the point of being sick if you're less than 3 ppl sharing. Overall I don't have much to say about the food: just decent but not outstanding.  The service however I find is absolutely AWFUL. And it doesn't matter whether you order in English or Mandarin, they will never take any particular requests seriously. Today was my second time going. We requested dessert (sago) to come right after the main dishes but it didn't come until over 45 minutes afterwards. So after we were done eating main dishes, we asked our waitress to bring the sago. The restaurant was half-empty, only one waitress was even on the floor at all and everyone was impatient. I went up to the kitchen desk to ask why a simple SAGO was taking so long and they were extremely rude, asking me \"Why are you here? You want the sago like... now? Or do you not want it?\" jesus christ I don't understand how this is even called customer service at all. Extremely disappointing. They completely forgot about the dessert (even though they always print an order confirmation prior to serving) and it came in less than 5 minutes after my complaint.   Would not recommend if you like your food in specific orders, don't have 2.5 hours to spend in one restaurant, or care about customer service in general. This review would have been 4 stars if it were food only."}
{"text":"Visiting Congee Wong a few times, we decided to try out Petit Potato located in the same plaza.  We went there on 08 November 2017 around 14:15.  It has a beautiful decor and we were greeted immediately and were shown to a booth right away.  Very quiet atmosphere and friendly and efficient staff.  It is a bit on the expensive side, but the food was excellent.  I ordered the chicken wings (6) with Yuzu Sauce for $7.99 and the vegetable spring rolls (5) for $5.99  My husband ordered the Beef bowl with rice and 1 cold honey green tea. I also appreciated that one of the servers was wearing a poppy on his shirt.  That is a wonderful and dedicated thing to do.  We had left overs which we took home and had them for dinner."}
{"text":"This a good place to hang out a simple meal with pretty good selection of rice pasta and ramen also lots of taiwanese drinks and not to mention the desserts service was good.  Had the egg rice with curry and chicken cutlet it was good will try pepper steak next time also had ramen the pork was tender juicy the fettuccine was just okay nothing special actually didn't really taste that good even though the looks good on the menu  for dessert we had mango toast it was humongous like a mountain very thick toast hollowed out with mango drizzle ice cream all over and it tasted great it was so big we couldn't finish it I wish they had two sizes small and large"}
{"text":"I came here unaware of the gigantic dessert towers they offered, soooo here's a lunch review! They have lunch specials, all of which come with a choice of drink (either black milk tea or honey lemon tea). I ordered a beef teppanyaki (suuupa hot fia, peep the pic I posted!) dish. The beef was sizzling and fresh. The corn added a good amount of flavour to it. A bit too much rice for my liking. The service was good. Easily got a booth, but longer waiting times once we were seated. Otherwise, good price (all lunch specials are less than $15) for a decent serving."}
{"text":"Atmosphere of this place was pretty well thought out. The staffs are pretty nice. Ordered the slice beef fettuccine in cream sauce 8/10 and ramen 7.5/10"}
{"text":"Typical dessert place that is conveniently close to Scarborough. There's nothing extremely special about the desserts here other than that huge toast dessert. I ordered the hot grass jelly dessert ($8), mango sago ($9), and marshmallow toast ($6). I was a little bit disappointed with the grass jelly dessert - it was barely warm and usually the topping would include some red bean paste, but this one just had the beans. I liked the mango sago - the portion is pretty big compared to most places that just serve it in a small bowl. The toast is good but was pricey - it would be more worth to get that gigantic toast rather than the small ones.   This isn't my favorite place to go for Asian dessert but it fulfills any sweet cravings."}
{"text":"Their clay pot soups are well prepared and tasty.  They definitely put some sort of expertise and additional time in getting the ingredients right.  I also tried the daunting 10\" French toast mango ice cream desert.  It was amazing.  It fed around five people.  I would definitely try this again but maybe a new flavour.  The service was a bit slow.  Some waiters were not very respectful, and show a bit of attitude."}
{"text":"Petit Potato is one of many such large Asian hangout diner cafes that dot the suburban landscape of Toronto. Being one of the newest of the scene, it's quite clear they got \"Instagrammability\" in mind when they conceived of this place, with such details like utensils shaped like shovels and pitchforks (you can buy that online, eh?), more of that hipster Edison lightbulbs hanging all around, or their own hashtag plastered in balloon letters that magically stay inflated all this time, ensuring the place is full of things to photograph. While their many cooked food options like tofu salad (which I'd recommend out of the apps menu) are decent, and their level of service on and off, I am sure many are enticed to coming here for their signature \"Special French Honey Golden Toast\" desserts, for which the bulk of this review is focused on.  I did mention \"Instagrammability,\" yes? Who knows how many people got seduced into trying the $13-15 brick toast dessert after seeing pics of it, and then underestimated the scale of it. Very. Big. BlogTO calls it \"epic\"; I call it absurdly overdone. They proudly advertise this being almost a foot tall worth of stacked thick toast, coated with cake icing and topped with vanilla ice cream. So fucking excessively overkill, one of the concoctions we ordered (yes, we had more than one--imagine the look on the face of one of the servers who took notice) actually toppled shortly after it was brought to us. I'd command those who are able to singlehandedly finish one of these on their own; it ought to have its own eating contest.  Insofar as foodie porn goes, only some of the brick toast desserts look aesthetically pleasing, like the Oreo version that looks like it came out of a Katy Perry music video. The mango version however looks like a slop of puke and, quite frankly, didn't taste that well--the flavours just don't work well together. Then there are some like the red bean matcha, while well advertised even on the window, are actually labelled as \"coming soon\" on the dine-in menu. So, what the heck?  As fun as it was, I wouldn't tackle the brick toast mess again. Nothing petit about it. It is an overrated and absurd fat and carb bomb collision where some of the stale and hard-to-cut-through-with-a-dull-butter-knife bread have been hollowed out and the bits stacked elsewhere in the concoction. The novelty of it is pretty much what makes Petit Potato a one-shot destination for deathtrap foodie social media fodder. Does the specialty dessert in question need to so excessive? I don't think so.  {TTC: 51 or 39 to Finch at Leslie; the stairs at the NE corner leads to the plaza housing Petit Potato. Parking here is a nightmare.}"}
{"text":"Petit Potato is a good place to go if you want to grab a bite to eat with friends or SO. I find that the decor is very cute and reminds me a lot of the cafes back in Asia. The two seaters can be quite uncomfortable and small if you order multiple dishes so if you can go into a booth definitely request for it. I found the food be quite mediocre. I've eaten multiple times and I was never wowed away by the food. I've had the omirice, the seafood ramen and durian pancakes. All dishes were a 6/10, I felt like I could've made it at home or I could've gone to another restaurant. Also if you try the toast dessert please make sure you have an appetite and sharing with atleast 4-6 people.   Pros: - cute decor  - a lot of seating  - fair amount of parking  - great food presentation   Con: - Price isn't bad but it's not exactly cheap either  - food quality could be better"}
{"text":"Our party of three came here for lunch today. Fortunately, we got a good parking spot in the busy plaza parking lot.   We ordered the salmon teppan, eel omurice, and pork cutlet omurice.  - The salmon teppan was delicious! It arrived on a sizzling plate which cooked the salmon to perfection.  - The eel omurice was, what I would describe as, heaven on a plate. The eel tasted similar to that you would find on eel sushi. The rice-filled omelet was fragrant and made my eyes rolled up. It had bits of mushroom as well, which I thoroughly enjoyed. - The pork cutlet omurice was just okay. The curry was on the thicker side, contrary to the watery consistency that other Yelpers had reviewed here in the past. Perhaps this restaurant caught wind and made their sauce thicker... than any curry I've ever had!   The pork cutlet omurice is part of their lunch special, which is the same as regular price but comes with a choice of hot beverage (hot black milk tea and something else like honey tea)  By the end, we were too stuffed to try their desserts but we'll definitely be back to tackle their toast tower.   Their decor is pretty modern and attractive. Their eating utensils are a mini shovel and mini pitchfork, and were very effective in shoveling food into my face like a barbarian.  If you haven't been, I'd recommend it. Try to come during off-peak hours to avoid parking hassles."}
{"text":"This is my go to for a nice place for both food and dessert, and you can take time to chill with friends. The decoration is cute and cozy, making a good spot for a late night date.  I have tried the most of the item in the menu and I have to be honest that not all of them are good. I would recommend the egg pudding, mango roll thingy (sr forgot the name lol), waffle and durian crepe with whipped cream. For savory food, I would suggest the rice on  hot stone bow with eel  and chicken wings with kumquat sauce. For the drink, most of them are good, I usually order fruit tea or alove vera tea."}
{"text":"Not coming back for their toast towers, that's for sure!!  My family came here for a dinner today because my mom really wanted to celebrate her birthday with their Mango Golden Toast tower dessert. (She had it before here and said it was good.) Beautifully presented! ...but definitely not made to please the taste buds. Once we started trying to cut the toast, we knew there was something wrong. The toast was so overtoasted that every part of it was crispy and dry. Even covering each toast with the cream for a while did not help to soften the bread. When we spoke to the waiter, he told us that brick toast is \"like this\" and said that it was \"fine\". It was definitely not \"like\" what my mom had been given before. Quality died?  I never write reviews.. but this was just that bad. I'd recommend... well, going to any place but here for brick toast.   **They do get a 2-star review, though, because their dinner food was okay.**"}
{"text":"A place for inexpensive, but fun and pretty desserts. Even better if you come here with friends, order and share the big toast thing - the tall plate of food is quite a sight!"}
{"text":"Came with 5 other friend for lunch. Ordered the chicken stir fry. Came on a hot plate. Was good but didn't like the ginger taste. My friend ordered Chicken Alfredo. Came on a hot plate as well. Not sure why they would want to put it on a hot plate ... she says it's tasteless and it looked like there not enough sauce. Rest of my ordered the omirice and they said it was good. Also ordered the red bean matcha ice cream toast. It was massive but we destroyed it between the six of us."}
{"text":"The first time I went here...I came on a Friday night at 8pm - bad idea. It was packed and there was a waitlist. So on  a whim, we came at 930pm on Monday (Halloween). When we first got there, it was half full - got seated right away. But surprisingly, by the time we left at 11pm - it was full house again - on a Monday night!!!! I guess they are just THAT busy - even their business hours are until 1am Mon-Thurs and 2am Fri/Sat.  Anyways, I felt like I was in ikea. Various designs of patterns and textures on the walls. There are booths, picnic style seating, tables made of large thick slabs of wood, light bulb pendents - all very modern and contemporary. Even the cutlery was in the shape of a shovel and pitchfork - really neat.   Very interesting menu - good variety of appies/shareables, entrees, and an extensive dessert menu which includes their massive towers of toast, assortment of fruit desserts, shaved ice, glutinous balls, bubble tea, and fruit shakes, and tea.  We ordered: - fresh pineapple and coconut milkshake - this was so good, refreshing, light, cold - like a slush - eel omurice - this was good. The egg was fluffy and sweet. There is rice inside the omelette. We felt there was too much terriyaki sauce - it was overpowering everything. For once - I felt that I needed more rice to cut the saltiness from the sauce. Ask for less sauce or sauce on the side - spicy seafood bibimbap - not very spicy - the sauce tasted like soy sauce mixed with a lot of sambal olek garlic chili sauce. This was our least favourite, too much rice - not enough toppings - golden mango dessert - this was 3 pieces of mango slices rolled in what seemed like an almond roll - at first, this dessert was very hard to eat bc the mango were frozen (seems canned) - but good after we came back to it bc we decided to eat the piping hot bibimbap instead  4stars bc: - kinda had to wave down the server to take our order, get more sauce/water, and even get the bill - food took long - our entrees didnt both come out at once, and our golden mango dessert came in btw our entrees - my friend got food poisoning at 0230am which I assume is from the seafood bibimbap bc he and I shared everything but I only ate the rice and eggs in the seafood bibimbap -- so he never wants to come back ever.  But I definitely would like to come back with a larger group of friends to order other things on the menu and try it all."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing.  I had the omurice with eel.  The perfect amount of sauce and rice.  It's a must try.  My hubby had the teppanyaki rice and added the egg. You have to add the egg it makes it so much better.  He loved it.    It's a clean comfortable place with amazing desserts and drinks.  We will definitely come back. This is a gem in the area."}
{"text":"Came here for the brick toast featured by BlogTO and was not disappointed! The mountain of thick toast covered in ice cream and mango was definitely the highlight. Be warned that the portion is quite big and it takes 4-6 people to finish the toast mountain. We also ordered popcorn chicken, steam rice rolls and bubble tea/coffee drinks.   Our group arrived around 9 and waited 10 minutes for a table. We stayed until 2 am and the servers never once rushed us to go. Petit Potato is a great place to catch up with friends over desserts and drinks."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: very busy and loud restaurant, good environment for a group of friends to chat. It would be too loud for a quiet date or catch up. The decorations and lighting was very bright, they have booths and open areas.   Food: many friends have recommended me to come here for their toast dessert. Warning: to order the dessert you need to wait 30 minutes for them to make it. The dessert toast, was deep fried, more toast than there was ice cream and whip cream leaving it to be very bready. I've order the mango one before and that one was my favorite, it had many real mango chunks. This dessert can be shared amongst 4 people to finish, it would be difficult to finish with one person as it is very sweet and filling.   As for the main meals they have a Japanese fusion of foods. They had ramen which wasn't bad but not great. I would definitely recommend trying the omelette egg with fried rice in the inside."}
{"text":"Definitely my favourite place for sweets and desserts!   I actually came here for both dinner and dessert. I ordered the Slice Pork Ramen as my main meal which tasted very average; it was nothing special. I ordered the Oreo Milk Tea as a drink and it was a bit blander than I thought it would be, but the presentation was very cute!  Nothing beats the strawberry and banana crepe! That is just pure heaven in your mouth! The egg pudding in the eggshells looked very unique and had a very rich and creamy texture to it. Everything presented by Petit Potato is pure aesthetics. The restaurant always has free wi-fi! The only problem would be the cost of the meals, in which my total was fairly expensive and unexpected.  Petit Potato is the perfect place to take the best-looking instagram photos and to enjoy some high-quality desserts."}
{"text":"Not bad and it's open late. Arrived around 11pm and they were still serving and was surprised to see a fair amount of people there considering it was a weeknight. Had their eel egg and rice, drinks, ramen and they were all decent. Of course when we were there for a friends birthday, we had the massive mango brick toast (they even put a candle on it which was nice) and between the 8 of us we JUST finished it :P"}
{"text":"Pros: fast, great service. decent dessert dishes. Cons: savoury dishes aren't so great.  Came here a few times with the family for dinner.  First time: Spicy Mix Vegetable Bibimbap 5/10. The bibimbap they offer here isn't like the usual bibimbap in that the sauce they give you isn't... bibimbap sauce. I'm not sure what it was. Perhaps a gingery soy sauce? No idea. Regardless of whether it was bibimbap or not, I didn't like it much.   Second time: I got the eel omurice w/ teriyaki 5/10. Each component of the dish by itself was good but together, it tasted weird. I couldn't finish the dish at the end because the cheese they put inside didn't compliment the eel very much.  Third time I came here, I got the salmon teppanyaki 6/10. This was surprisingly good but the portion was a small for my appetite.   I've also tried their honey garlic chicken wings which are alright, 6/10.  For dessert, I tried the egg puddings 7/10. This was great the first time I had it but the second time around, it was just too sweet and too creamy and buttery for my taste.  Service is pretty good here, waiters are attentive, good atmosphere and great aesthetics. Would only come back if my dinner guests want to though."}
{"text":"Came here last night for Chinese desserts and for their toast/ice cream tower. We ordered their mango toast tower which came with 4 slices of thick toast - hollowed out, mango pieces, ice cream, smaller bread croutons and this cream sauce that had mango sauce in it. Regrettably, I was unable to try it due to the dairy in the dessert however my friends said that the ice cream was good but the toast tasted stale. They mentioned that it was unlike the condensed milk toasts that you would get at bubble tea shop where the bread had a bit of sweetness to it. The price for the toast/ice cream tower was $14.99 which isn't bad shared among 4 people.  I ordered their glutinous rice balls with peanuts inside served in a sweet ginger soup. The rice balls were cooked perfectly, the peanuts inside were crunchy and the ginger soup had the perfect balance of ginger taste and sweetness from the sugar. The atmosphere inside was was very modern, service was quick and efficient and from the other tables around me, it seemed like they also served hot food for lunch/dinner. A good place to check out if you are in the neighbourhood - I would love to try their hot foods on my next visit!"}
{"text":"I've seen lots of posts from Petit Potato so it's been on my list for quite a while. I finally got the chance to come here, along with some friends visiting from out of town. It was very crowded when we arrived but we managed to get a table after a short wait.  We were looking for dessert, and of course, we had to order the house specialty, golden toast. We also ordered a mango roll and a super mango slush.  The mango roll and slush arrived first. The mango roll was delicious, sweet ripe mango chunks rolled in a coconut gelatin. The mango slush was good but maybe a little diluted in flavour from the ice used to make the slush. Perhaps less ice would have made it tastier.  The toast takes around 30 minutes but when it arrived, the presentation made quite an impression. It's big and tall, dripping with sweet goodness. Unfortunately, we thought it looked better than it tasted. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great enough that we may order it again. Five of us shared it and we couldn't finish it.  Maybe I'll come back to try their savoury food."}
{"text":"I came here on a late night and got the spaghetti (I can't remember exactly what the title of it is on the menu). You get to choose your choice of protein (tofu, salmon, chicken, etc.), and a sauce. I got salmon with tomato sauce and it came on a sizzling hotplate which was a very cool presentation. Spaghetti was pretty good, but I feel like I could make something similar at home. The servers are really nice though!"}
{"text":"The greeter at the door was warm and we were seated quickly. It was around 2:15 pm on a Saturday and the place was it busy at all.   Petit Potato is like a fancier and bigger version of any bubble tea house but serves a lot more food and desserts plus fruit drinks.   Let's just say, that's the end of the good things I have to say. Service was extremely slow and the waitress was very apologetic when we mentioned twice we had been waiting over 20 minutes just for 3 drinks.   Also the cup they gave me was dirty!   Then there's the drinks... some was ok, like the fruit teas but don't ever order the drink that lookalike a potted plant with dirt. It's gross, texture like chunky lukewarm sludge with cookie crumbs and the photo in the menu looks nothing like the real thing."}
{"text":"My sister and my boyfriend decided to check this place out for dessert because we love Taiwanese toast and they did not disappoint. We got their signature toast and one sago.   Their toast was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Their toast is extremely large (3 thick slices of bread) and you need at least 3 people to finish it. The price is not bad considering one piece of toast usually costs $6-7 at regular tea stores and they charge $14-15. Although there is a lot of foam around the toast it surprisingly is not too sweet. We got the strawberry one but there's other flavours such as mango and green tea but you have to talk to the servers.    The sago was not THAT good but for the price and all the fruit they give its alright.   Definitely coming back for the salty foods next time and trying out the different toast flavours."}
{"text":"With asian desert cafes opening up rather rapidly due to the hype it has been gathering, this was a more recent addition to my list of places to try.   The first time i came here, i was typically and tried their monstrous mango toasts. My friend and i regrettably didn't not finish it, but we honestly didn't think we would. It was splendid to take pictures of, but rather quickly, the sweetness and thickness of the cream became way too much for us. It was a good experience, but unlikely to order again unless there were at least 3+ more people.   The next time we came, we had ordered a green tea creme brûlée and a fruit waffle. The creme brûlée was good and the tea flavour was there, but we couldn't taste if it was green tea. The waffles were not good, the waffles were rather dry and all and all not tasty.  We had also orders the Oreo potted drink and that was also a let down. Initially the presentation was adorable and the idea was cute, but the drink was basically just shaved Oreos on top of a hot milk tea that wasn't all that good either."}
{"text":"What a great place to get all your Asian cravings. They offer great tasting Taiwanese, to Japanese, to Hong Kong cuisine at a great price. Some of the highlights include popcorn chicken, rice rolls, omurice, teppan rice/pasta, soup noodles, drinks, and of course their golden toast desserts and many other desserts."}
{"text":"Oh, petit potato! I love this restaurant. I have been coming here at least five times in the last two months. I recently found out about this restaurant and I wish I knew about it sooner. It is very close to my work place, so a couple of times, my coworker(s) and I would have a late night/afternoon snacks or meals (depending on our shifts) here. The flavours of their foods are great! It is delicious and my favourite dish to order are the omurice (steak, especially!) I recently brought my family here and they love it as much as I do. The ambience , design, and the theme (pitchfork and shovel utensils!) just fits all together. I love the cozy feeling, and the cleanliness of the place makes it stunning. I found the prices to be very affordable for the amount they serve. This is one of my favourite food places to go for something casual and fun meals. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I'm quite positive a very large number of people came to check out Petit Potato because they've seen somebody posting the Brick Toast Tower on social media. I, for one, was among this group of people.   When I got to my table I didn't even bother to check out the menu because I was sure I wanted the Brick Toast. I ordered the Mango Brick Toast and was informed that the wait time would be about 30 minutes. However, it only took them 20 to serve the food, which was awesome because I've been eyeing on the Brick Toast for a long time. But first, pictures time!!  The Brick Toast was pretty good, but since it's covered in condensed milk and mango flavoured syrup, we got sick of it very fast to the point that it felt gross taking another bite. So if you're also planning to order the Brick Toast, be sure to come with like 3 other person in order to finish it when it's still fresh. When I packed it and tried to heat it up the day after it just didn't taste the same.   We've also ordered some other foods such as ramen and beef on hot plate with green pepper, but those tasted average, and I find the food to be more expensive than comparable HK style cafe. Also, portions are not very big, didn't have any leftovers to take home. Go to Congee Wong next door and you'll pretty much find many comparable food items at a cheaper price with bigger portions."}
{"text":"Came for dinner with some friends. I had the slice beef pepper rice, comes on a sizzling platter and you need to mix it yourself. Additional add ons available (i.e. egg, mushroom, garlic, cheese), although I didn't add any and it was still pretty good!  Friends had the omurice, eel and steak, both good.   At the end of our meal we ordered the special Mango special golden toast. The menu says to allow for 30 mins to prepare, it actually took around 45 mins, which was unfortunate. I'm not usually a fan of brick toast, but this was excellent. The toast in the centre is actually cut into small pieces that are toasted individually and then topped with ice cream, light cream, fruits, and fruit  sauce. We substituted green tea ice cream for mango, and they were very accommodating.  Service was good, even though they were busy on Friday night."}
{"text":"Came here after seeing the stack of brick toast with ice cream on top.. looked delicious but at the price they were charging for, it would've been cheaper to just make a couple of toasts and a few scoop of ice cream and strawberries at home."}
{"text":"This place is good for photos (i.e., the mountains of brick toast topped with all sorts of ridiculousness) but that is more or less the only reason why you'd really want to come here.  First off, the menu. It's an eclectic combination of random themes and items that might be best described as \"fusion.\" Fused between what, you might ask. Well you've got an obvious Japanese connection (with the ramen, omurice, and takoyaki offerings). There is a random Korean connection with the \"bibimbap\" options. And then there is some typical Chinese stuff (be it HK or Taiwan); most of the desserts fit in this category. It is hard to pinpoint what exactly they were trying to accomplish here. The menu is really quite disconnected, even moreso than Toronto's transit system.  As for actual food quality, it is hit or miss. According to my companions, the ramen is quite good, though expectedly not quite up to the same standard as any authentic ramen house. Their rendition of bibimbap I found extremely awkward. It comes in a small bowl overflowing with toppings, to the point that you're unable to stir up the sauce into the bowl. And the bowl is actually quite small compared to the bibimbap you would get at any Korean place. It also is not as satisfying when it comes to flavour (beware that the sauce they give you is some other random sauce and not the standard gochujang). The teppanyaki rice seems interesting, but at the end of the day it's basically more or less a bulgogi (or something similar) served with rice ON the hot plate itself. Cute attempt at trying to be creative, but it's only about as creative as a Justin Bieber song.  Desserts are interesting and good for some photos so that you can generate some social media envy. But at the end of the day, it's nothing special compared to your average Taiwanese or HK dessert house.  Service was hectic on a Saturday night and we found it difficult to track down servers. They got the job done but there is nothing in particular to commend. Place gets busy on weekends - arrive later than 7 and you might find yourself having to wait a little while for a table. Decor is pretty modern and trendy, good enough for a date if you can stand the spotty service.  All in all, not a place that I would actively want to go back to but it's good enough that I wouldn't try to avoid it like the plague."}
{"text":"Great selection of appetizers, mains, desserts and drinks. It's like an upgraded version of Destinys. Really love the popcorn chicken and eel omurice. Roasted marshmallow toast is hard to eat. Would not recommend if you tryna kiss your boo after. The icecream tower is aesthetically cool to look at."}
{"text":"Food tastes less then mediocre.... Unfortunately everything served at this restaurant can be made better at home. Desert was alright, the restaurant uses a lot of whip cream with everything, you're basically paying for whipped cream. I had the mango pancake? And the entire filling was one piece of mango with a ton of whipped cream."}
{"text":"I came to Petit Potato knowing absolutely nothing about it. Upon arrival, I immediately spotted the (in)famous special golden toast towers and was intrigued. This, of course, is their intent (that, and an instagram-worthy photo!) So my friends and I took the bait. Between four of us, and a toddler, we ordered the Purple Yam Golden Toast, and some appetizers. Typical Taiwanese dishes like rice noodle rolls (cut up into bite size, shareable pieces drizzled with sesame and hoisin sauce), Taiwanese sausage and popcorn chicken were delicious. But when the golden toast arrived, I was weary: these days, an instagram worthy picture sometimes takes precedence over taste. But this had both. Don't get me wrong: this is complete sugar overload, but it was pretty tasty and perfect to share between all of us.  When I came back here with my parents, we went the lunch route: I ordered 2 apps, my parents ordered the pepper beef omurice and spicy chicken hot plate. Both were good, but the omurice was especially delicious. We all enjoyed our lunches. Glad that I've found a new go-to place near home."}
{"text":"Dinner: I had the spicy chicken with rice on the side. The taste, portioning, and price of the food was average. It's wasn't outstanding, but I'd come again.  Dessert: Petit Potato has a wide selection of great desserts, but the portions are very small. I don't recommend the taro snowflake, but I'm interested in trying the mango snowflake next time."}
{"text":"I think I like the décor more than the food which is quite unfortunate because we ARE talking about a restaurant.  Staff: We were seated very quickly for a Saturday evening. Food is quick except for the Special Golden Toast which they had warned may take a longer time to make (they say 30 minutes but I'm pretty sure it was longer). I did appreciate them sticking the order back to the table so we had verification of what was ordered.  Ambience: I like the tiny shovels as cutlery and the cutting boards as part of the menu. I also found it very comfortable in the booth and it was quite roomy.  Food: The Apple Mango Juice Mix left much to be desired and was quite bland to be honest. We shared a Strawberry Special Golden Toast which was shared amongst 6 people and quite filling. I liked the toast, I wish there was more ice cream and less of the whipped cream which was quite filling but not in the good sense (more queasy filling).  Overall I'd get the toast again if other people wanted it again but I wouldn't seek out this place specifically."}
{"text":"Went 2 times . Would only recommend eating desserts here. Their signature toast with ice cream is good to share with 3 people. Food wise I was a bit disappointed. The old restaurant had better food but now they tried to do both food and desserts which is too much I think. Also I came once on a sat night...waited for 40 mins for a table of 3. Suggest to go after 9:30 or weekday. Would go back if wait wasn't so long"}
{"text":"Neat little place that serves a mix of almost fusion menu. Came specifically for the mango bread tower dessert and was disappointed.  Not good at all. Also tried the ramen which was decent but you're better off going to a specialized ramen place."}
{"text":"This place is extremely CUTE from decor to the utensils (pitch forks and shovels). another one of those places that try to be unique or one of a kind in the area. The food didn't really live up to the hype of it though. Went for late night dessert on a week day and was kind of packed. Generally awesome for groups and service was friendly.   The selection of Chinese and western fusion dessert is pretty common. I would recommend to stay away from their Chinese desserts because it did give my tummy a bit of trouble. Don't get me wrong, I love Chinese dessert and eat it often but this one... I think it's because the coconut milk was not fresh. BUT the creme brûlée I ordered was HUGE!. I was impressed with the texture and taste; not too sweet or tasteless. I usually eat it without the layer of sugar on top though, not really my thing to taste burnt sugar."}
{"text":"Service was not the greatest; our cups of water were emptied most of the time, and the waiters were not filling them unless we asked for it.  We ordered the Red Bean Matcha Special Golden Toast. The taste of the dessert was mediocre."}
{"text":"Went in with the family on a weekday lunch. Ordered the sirloin omu rice, pork katsu omu rice, sizzling mui choy and pork, popcorn chicken ramen.  Overall, pork katsu was a winner followed by sirloin omu rice. Very flavourful with delicious rice and portion is reasonable for the cost.  However, other 2 orders lacked. Having had popcorn chicken from many other restaurants, i anticipated juicy plump popcorn chicken.  What i got was decently battered dry flavourless chicken.  Ramen was decent with a very rich broth.  For the sizzling mui choy and pork dish, we would not order again.  Seems onion slices and sweet thick sauce make up majority of the dish... ack.  3 of the dishes came with drinks; ordered cold honey green tea and hot milk tea.  Green tea was delicious, milk tea was off; it tasted like tea leaves were mixed up when brewing by they tried hiding it with sugar in the milk tea  Would i go back again? Sure. Would i order same dishes? Definitely not all"}
{"text":"Great service.  Solid ingredients.  Clean place.  Smart decor.    Wide selection. Good price. Has power outlets at the tables for you to work with."}
{"text":"Came back a second time and had a much better time! The food was pretty good actually. The environment is a bit too noisy for my liking but otherwise it was a good experience. I would come back a third time."}
{"text":"My group ordered a few things and I got to try them all! The menu was a unique design but we sort of big and cumbersome. We ordered the Pork Cutlet Omurice with Curry, Takoyaki (octopus balls), Popcorn Chicken Ramen and the Gyudon (Beef over rice). The dessert we got was a super long title: House Special Super Golden Sago Mixed with Mango Ice Cream.  Omurice: Although it emphasizes the spiciness, the curry wasn't that spicy at all. I felt like the portions for this dish were small compared to the other dishes we ordered, but the taste was alright. The rice was wrapped in a thin sheet of egg and topped with a pork cutlet and curry. It was arranged so nicely that I almost didn't want to eat if I wasn't starving.  Takoyaki: Nothing much to say about this. It was average, on par with takoyaki I've ordered from other restaurants.  Popcorn Chicken Ramen: This was my favourite dish in terms of taste. The broth was salty and creamy. They gave a generous helping of popcorn chicken at the side. I appreciated how they put the chicken in a separate bowl so that it wouldn't get soggy in the soup.  Gyudon: Again, nothing much to say. It was beef that was fairly nicely flavoured over plain white rice. I had to use the curry from the omurice just to make the gyudon bearable to eat. The rice to beef ratio wasn't very good.  Dessert: It was good! The strange thing is that they gave us the dessert at the same time as the entrees and appetizers, though I believe this what our miss for not specifying. There was an abundance of different fruits mixed in, which were all sweet for the most part. The only fruit that wasn't sweet was the mango. Not fresh at all!  Overall, service was good. The food came out quick. They were pretty attentive despite it being a full house. I would recommend trying the omurice just for how unique it is from what I've eaten before and the popcorn chicken ramen for the taste. One day, I'll come here again for their special toast!"}
{"text":"As some others have mentioned, this place has changed English names several times but the Chinese name is still the same.  I came here recently in hopes they still had their lunch combos (~$7-8) that came with a grapefruit/peach green tea with tapioca..but those days seem to be gone now. The restaurant has been renovated with plenty of seating.  I ordered the pork rib ramen and beef teppan pepper rice (~$10-11). Both lunch combos came with a mason jar mug of refreshing and aromatic honey iced green tea. The food was delicious and portions were very reasonable.   The service was pleasant as it was not busy, there were maybe 2-3 other tables at 2PM on a Friday.  They seem to be mainly focused on desserts, will be back to try the giant mountain of toast topped with ice cream as others have posted."}
{"text":"Came here for an evening dinner and got the garlic ramen, yuzu chicken wings and steak omurice. The black garlic pork sliced ramen was really good (a little salty) but still delicious ($12.95). The chicken wings with yuzu sauce a little pricey for the amount you get ($8.99/6 pieces). It was also tangy because of the yuzu sauce. My favourite was probably the beef striploin steak omurice with black pepper sauce ($14.99) - again, a little pricey but worth the price since it did get me full and the portions definitely bigger than what it looks like in the picture. The ambiance of the place was cute, cafe vibes. We didn't get to try their famous desserts but that just gives us a reason to go back.   Downsides? Probably just the price but other than that, they close late - good for us hungry night owls!"}
{"text":"I went here with my bestie last week and we ordered a ramen, beef donburi and toast tower. The ramen tastes good but the it is a small portion compare to the other ramen store in Toronto. Beef donburi is big but the meat tastes quite dry. I think it will be better if it has more sauce in it. Overall, their famous toast tower is so far the best out of our meal. And we both agree it is the best one compare to the other restaurant that provide Brick Toast in GTA. You won't be regret coming to this place anymore after ordering this dish, even if their savory dishes can't amazed you. Giving you all a heads up, the toast tower is huge and quite filling. It will be the best if you are coming with another 3 accompanies. Otherwise, you will have to pregnant belly when you leave."}
{"text":"Can't find anything to complain about. Would definitely return. Lots of friendly staff, fast food. The sizzling chicken was fantastic and cheap, and we had the Oreo bread dessert, which is definitely enough for 4 people. The BBT was also great with fresh tapioca."}
{"text":"The food takes way too long and the service is absolutely horrendous, not only does the toast take 50 minutes to make, they gave my drink to another table and then gave that someone back to me with lipstick stains on the straw saying they didn't touch it. Worst dessert house I have been to. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"The word \"petit\" in French means \"small or little\"... man is that a misnomer or what in that this was a Taiwanese joint that served big ass portions of brick toast desserts!  The family wanted to have some dessert so we decided to try the brick toasts that everyone has been talking about for a while.  These massive creations are piled up high and each order can easily feed 3-4 for dessert but if you are hungry then 1-2 people without any diabetes or pre-diabetes can do the job!  The restaurant was busy but we had no problems ordering.  The brick toast took 20 mins to come out so not too bad compared to what some people have said.  Funny to watch when they put the toasts on the table people start taking out the phone fighting each other to get the best Instagram worthy shot on their phone:)  Taste wise, the brick toasts were pretty good!  We ordered a strawberry and a mango flavored one.   The only thing I would have liked was if they used  better ice cream as I'm not if the ice cream was real dairy or the coconut oil based one.  One item that I would really recommend is the Matcha Shaved Ice with Red Bean and Popping Boba.  The matcha flavour was actually more richer then the one served at Cha Me Cha and the popping boba gave a great contrast in texture to the dessert.  Despite it being busy we found it easy to flag down servers as they were quite attentive.  There was also a huge food menu which we will definitely come back to try the next time we are in the area.  \"Petit Potato\"??  Should be renamed \"Big Ass Potato\" if you ask me!!"}
{"text":"My brother in law had been raving about their golden brick toasts since he learned of our visit home! It was a \"must try\" regardless how full we felt.   We ordered the strawberry version. We were mentally prepared to wait the quoted 30 minutes for the heavenly toasts. But at one hour mark during the non peak hour, we were so ready to walk out. When we finally had our chance to dig in, it was the most disappointing bite on this trip. Aside from the Instagram worthy presentation, the brick toasts were just stale bread with overwhelming amount of cheap mini marshmallows, melted whipped cream and ice cream. The stale bread/toasts weren't even warm! We saw a stack of them already made by the counter. Why did they take almost an hr to assemble?   Do yourself a favor - buy a whole loaf of bread, toast it, drizzle some condensed milk, want something fancy? Throw a scoop of ice cream on top, maybe some fruits too - way better tasting, way better quality. And I just saved you an hour of your life."}
{"text":"The menu has so many choices and all the desserts look so yummy! The teriyaki omurice was sweet and tasted very good at the beginning; getting closer to the end of it, the sweetness of the sauce became a bit much. The deep fried chicken cartilage appetizer was very good; nice and crispy with mayo for sauce.   The egg pudding was amazing! Very light and fluffy. Not too sweet either."}
{"text":"Update: gave their food a second try. I ordered the beef with rice on hot plate again cuz I really didn't want to risk it with any other dishes but Boyfriend tried their pork katsu curry omurice and it was horrible. The pork tasted sour like it was undercooked, and the curry was literally cold. I have reasons to believe their curry is microwave curry and clearly the cook doesn't know how to make a proper dish editable.   Advice: spend less money on marketing and actually try to cook editable food."}
{"text":"Big menu and they are famous for those giant toasts. I tried their savoury dishes, which were average, nothing to write home about.   Unlike the usual toasts that you would get from an Asian dessert place, the ones at Petit Potato are approx. 10 inches high and have 3 layers of crispy toast. They are then hollowed out, filled with smaller chunks of toasts then topped with ice cream and fruits. Ranging from $12.99 to $14.99, this toast is definitely shareable between 3-4 people! Also, these took around 20-30 minutes to be made, so I suggest ordering this from the beginning and not wait until the end of the meal.  While I thought all the toasts weren't too sweet, I found the smaller toasts that were inside to be quite dry. While I understand that they might not have been soaked in condensed milk in order to stay crispy - thus making it easier to stack the toast - it was still not enjoyable."}
{"text":"If you're reading this, you've probably heard of Petit Potato's infamous tower of ice cream and bread.  I will get there.. but first of all, this place is always packed. I love the idea of creating 'instagrammable' food. They definitely draw a big crowd by having food that is photo worthy. I've been here twice and both times had to wait about 15-30 minutes to get in. I haven't tried any food here.. only the desserts. And they can be a hit or miss. I tried the durian sago and it was really good, but I've also tried the cold double boiled milk and it wasn't good at all.  Onto the tower, we ordered the matcha ice cream tower and it took about 20 mins to come out.  After all the pictures were taken, we began digging in.  Don't expect too much. It's very very carb and fat heavy consisting of just bread and cream and more cream. After the first 5 bites, you'd get sick of it.  We shared one tower between 6 of us and it was plenty. You're literally eating toasted bread with heavy cream and some vanilla ice cream. My girlfriend had to go outside and puke because there was too much cream.  That being said, no regrets.. definitely a place you'd go once for the pictures and not again. You can find better desserts."}
{"text":"At first I was quite intrigued by the unique culmination of different types of trendy Asian foods placed in their menu that have accumulated over the years.. However it has disappointed me to realize that although there are many options the quality of 2 of our recent dishes have decreased substantially.   We had ordered pork intestine on a sizzling plate which was 40-60% onion sliced and the rest the actual main entree. I know a lot of cheap Asian places tend to do this, but if your gonna cover the entire entrée with a component that deters many and obscures ones understanding of what it actually is then that in itself is really disappointing.. The sauce was this weird tasting sweet & sour sauce. I hope this reaches someone of impact so you can up up your game. DO NOT ORDER pork intestine sizzling plates off the lunch menu if you know what's good for you..  I was not as unfortunate as the other party on our table as I had ordered a minced pork on rice w/ an egg Taiwanese style. However this one had also saddened my expectations as it tasted like compressed ground pork rather than having a variation of fat to pork ratio like generally decent places tend to do..  If your gonna be a new and trendy spot then at least live up to decent standards or else what is the point selling goods substandard within this industry and losing residual customers along the way.  On a more positive note, the complementary milk tea was quite good though and I know there are some good options here like the tender pork rib ramen. I would still suggest however consider adding more of the rib portion, rather than making it relatively a minute portion of the dish. I can't say the same for your golden toast special though which was your standard trend for people going there at 1st given the size - as when you bite into it it tastes mostly like bread. I understand why interest may plumet now however, maybe see how many people actually order it still and consider improving. Oh and the problem with the beef tongue was that it barely had any pieces in it and the cost did not outweigh the disappointment.   Considering a 2, but have now decided to maintain a 1, since 1/5 dishes were good. :)"}
{"text":"Interesting place in a Chinese plaza at Leslie/Finch. Yes, it's correct to call it Asian Fusion, but when that term was coined, it referred to the fusion of Asian and western cuisines. This place is Asian-Asian fusion. Like, Chinese/Korean/Japanese mixed in with a bit of \"who came up with that weird/tasty combination?\"  Anyways, we went for a late dinner on a weeknight (after kid's hockey game) and they delivered piping hot, fairly good food, tout suite. Had to throw in some French in my review since the name of the place is inexplicably half-French. We ordered spicy-pork bibimbap, pork ramen, and Japanese beef bowl. I finished the family's leftovers (due to the small portion size of the bibimbap) so consider me eminently qualified to judge the quality of all three meals.  bibimbap: mildly spicy (half chili out of 4), tasty, but small. I liked how the stone bowl kept it hot throughout and also gave the rice a nice crispy outer shell.  ramen: standard fare, good but nothing to write home about. A bit too much corn for my taste  beef bowl: blah. not much to it -- rice and beef, exactly as described. there are probably better choices on the menu  Cool décor, and we loved the spade/pitchfork utensils as well as the \"City of Ember\" light bulbs. I'd post a few photos but I figured there must be a few in the 500 photos posted already.  The night we were there it was mildly busy but I would guess that it's pretty crazy in the summer, with all the fancy drink concoctions and that towering toast/dessert thing they sell. (Not sure what the fuss is about, but we didn't try it.)  Would go back just to try some of the other stuff that they had on the menu, there's a lot of things there I haven't seen elsewhere."}
{"text":"Cute place to check out for dessert if you're in the area! It can get pretty busy at night, even during the week so parking space can be difficult to find (especially with Sushi Legend and Congee Wong next door).   During our last visit there, we got the Black Glutinous Rice w/ Coconut Milk and the Fresh Mango Snowflake. Both were pretty good! It is a bit on the pricier side compared to other dessert places."}
{"text":"Surprised how the restaurant that petite potato replaces had bad food and now it still has bad food.   Mango Special Golden Toast ($14.99) - one of their signature desserts. It was really hyped on social media. During our visit, this dessert took over an hour to come. When it finally came and we tested it out. We were all extremely disappointed. The brick toast was good, it was crispy and buttery but the topping drizzled on top of it was not. They topped it with cream sauce and mango syrup. The cream sauce was too overwhelming and the mango syrup tasted like bottled mango syrup. They then topped it with fresh mango bits. It tasted horrible, our table barely touched it. It was way too sweet and the sauce just wasn't good. They brick toast would've been better with less sauce or even none. I feel like they are trying to imitate the famous brick toast tower from a dessert place in Hong Kong called TeaWood but its incomparable. Teawood's brick toast was delicious. This order of dessert can feed 4 or more people. It's worth a try if you want.  Special Teppan Pepper rice with Beef slice ($9.99) - Ordered the sizzling beef rice. The dish wasn't good at all. We ordered it with gravy. The dish tasted like cheap gravy on rice. Horrible dish, do not order.   Chrysanthemum and longan tea ($6.99) - the tea was pretty good but nothing special. Something you can find anywhere or make at home. The tea pot was cute though.  Matcha Creama ($5.49)  - This drink was decent.   Overall, this place is only good for pictures other than that food and dessert is really bleh............"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. I liked the experience a lot more when it wasn't so busy. In the earlier days there were hardly lines but now even on a Sunday night around 8pm it's busy.   I enjoy eating the Salmon Teppan with pasta & black pepper sauce. My staple meal here though I believe they are cheaping out slightly with the portion as I'm now able to finish the entire thing, whereas before I had to pack some home. I find the drinks a bit too pricy. The bbt I usually order at Chatime was super small at Petite Potato and they charged over $5 for it. I should have just gone to the Chatime around the corner then hit up Petit Potato instead. Could have sworn the drinks were once served in a larger glass (almost like a mason jar) now it's in a puny glass with a crapload of ice and not very much grass jelly. Never ordering drinks here again.    I love the brick toast dessert. But you definitely need a few friends to help finish it... or you better have not eaten for a few days to finish that.  Service used to be really good but now it's a completely different experience since they are super busy. No staff came by to check on us and it was nearly impossible to flag them down."}
{"text":"good food beautiful and tasty. this is my second week come to Toronto. I went there with my friend. The food look really beautiful and taste. As a Chinese, it fits my flavor and get a high class feeling. Highly recommended  take girls there.^_^"}
{"text":"assorted sweet dumplings with coconut milk- the mango one was broken, chocolate one is weird  Iced honey chrysan& rose tea - pretty but bland  Environment is nice"}
{"text":"The portion was small for the price they charged!!  Parking was a nightmare at lunch time on a wknd!  No parking, food, price advantages.  Most likely not go back."}
{"text":"Visited here on a Friday night after midnight and it was pretty busy. This place is currently a fairly new dessert restaurant.  We tried their Special Golden Toast which was really good. Loved the crispy toastiness of the bread combined with the cream/ice cream. This is probably pretty unhealthy though because it is a heavy cream. You definitely want a group of people to help eat this and not have it all by yourself!  We also tried the mango pancake and sweet dumplings (Tong yuen?). The pancake had a bit too much cream but tasted pretty good. The dumplings were interesting as they were green tea with custard inside.  Overall worth a try and I would probably come back. Definitely bring a group to help distribute the food because the desserts seem pretty fattening lol."}
{"text":"3 things I like and don't like  1. Environment - I really love the overall setting of Petit Potato. As soon as you enter you can just feel you are about to have a great time because everyone seems beyond excited to try the vast dessert options. It's laid back, fun, and exciting to eat here.  2. Golden Toast! - The main thing people will talk about when recommending Petit Potato to their friends and family is the massive golden toast with flavours ranging from mango to Oreo. I can remember my friend showing me a picture of the mango golden toast and my jaws just dropping at the sight of it.  3. Not Just A Dessert Place - Omurice, teppan rice, teppan pasta, and ramen. These are just a few of the great entrees you can get at Petit Potato, all of which are no joke. The ultimate experience is getting one of these entrees and then having a golden toast for dessert."}
{"text":"Petit Potato always has a place in my heart. I usually recommend this restaurant to friends who can never decide where and what to eat lol. It used to be a dessert place LONG time ago, glad it has now transformed into a popular local eatery with bright and modern renovations, and an extensive menu to satisfy all cravings!  They are first known for the French Honey Golden Toast Tower, made with 3 layers of thick toasts, and topped with a huge scoop of ice cream and various toppings! I have tried the Mango and the Oreo one, and they were delicious! WARNING: DO NOT attempt to eat this after dinner unless that IS your dinner lol. Highly recommend to share the tower with your friends, meaning 4 people or more lol.  More favourite go-to items: Chrysanthemum & Rose Tea - so refreshing! Shrimp Salad with sesame dressing HK style steamed rice rolls Unagi Omurice Marshmallow Toast Mango shaved ice dessert  The seating is first come, first serve. Unless you have a larger group, it is recommended to call beforehand and see if they can accommodate. The restaurant is always busy during rush hours... I usually try to avoid ^^\""}
{"text":"The instagram pictures make it look so exciting. However when you go to this restaurant it was a \"cozy\" atmosphere and intimidating food. The instagram worthy shots are HUGE and when I looked around the restaurant, NO ONE finished them.  We ordered: Condensed Milk Toast and the House Special Super Golden Sago Mixed with Mango Ice cream. I must say it was very enjoyable. It House Special Sago Mix tasted really refreshing with the fresh fruit added definitely something I would come back for. The condensed milk toast he nothing spectacular, when you order the basic dish it is pretty much the same everywhere.   The issue is the service. It is like a chase to get someone. We asked for three green teas and 15 minutes later STILL NOTHING. Also the menu is overwhelming, different types of food kind of all over the place. Other than that I could be perhaps something I might go to, if I was in the area...."}
{"text":"Was here last weekend. I was really surprised that they actually have a lunch menu with actual food. It also tasted pretty good! We ordered a veggie bibimbap and a ice cream and waffles. The waffles were super buttery and crisp. It could be considered food for the soul, I would say! It would be nice if they made their own ice cream, but otherwise, I was not disappointed. The veggie bibimbap was delicious with the sauce although it was piled mountain high and we could barely mix in the sauce. The good thing is that they oiled the stone bowl so none of the rice was stuck. Overall, it was a pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"I came here without having any high expectations because of reviews and the low ratings. But after visiting this place 2 times, I feel like this restaurant is very underrated!  The food here is delicious and not to mention the dessert was stupendous. They have a large variety of food here from bibimbap to ramen.   The design and atmosphere here is great as well. It was very nicely decorated and the service was great. It was very busy when I went so reservations would be advised if you do not want to wait long.   All in all, I would definitely recommend this place to family and friends! This place is amazing."}
{"text":"The desserts are very mediocre. The taste is very bland and too watery without much substance. I ordered a grass jelly coconut milk soup, and it wasn't uniform in temperature, as in some parts were hot and some parts were lukewarm. The interior decor and utensils are very cute though, and the service is very friendly."}
{"text":"It is my first time to visit Petit Potato after its makeover. Now it serves Asian /Taiwanese food.   Pork Ramen - broth and ramen were decent. Portion was good. There were two slices of chasu and they tasted okay.   Rose honey tea (hot) - the pot of tea came with 2 small cups, $6.99 to share with two people wasnlt bad. It tasted good.   Pork chop Omurice with curry - the good - Curry was tasty. The egg was runny at the ends but not in the centre part. The bads - Omurice was cold to room temperature when I had it. The pork chop was hot though, so I wonder if the Omurice were pre-made. The pork chop was small and not tender.   Price tend to be on the high side and there is no lunch menu. Would I return? May be not."}
{"text":"3.5* stars  Been here twice in the past few days because of the toast brick photos on IG. The last time I had a toast brick mountain was at Teawood Cafe in Hong Kong 3 years ago so I was super excited that it finally arrived in Toronto.  Menus are served on a cute platter and they have a extensive dessert menu. So obviously you can't come to petit potato without ordering their signature toast brick ($14.99). I've had both the mango one and the blueberry one. If you don't know what it is, it is basically 4 toast bricks, hollowed out, filled with more pieces of toast, topped with icecream and decorated with real fruits (mangos/blueberries), syrup, and a crapload of whipped cream. DEFINETLY bring at least 4 people because 2 little asian girls can not finish it at all lol... maybe half. I've also tried the popcorn chicken which is great (tastes similar to the taiwanese popcorn chicken you get at Destiny's or Cha Me Cha), takoyaki (comes in 5/6 pieces I think), and steak omurice which I thought was disappointing. Have you seen those videos on Facebook about Japan's omurice which when cut have the egg oozing out deliciousness? Well for Japanese/Taiwanese fusion, I was expecting something somewhat similar but was presented which steak topped on top of a dry egg omlette on top of some rice. First off, the meal wasn't even hot or warm really anymore. The steak was not bad actually... very seasoned in black pepper and tender. But the egg (which could use some ketchup in my opinion) was really overcooked thus tasting plain and dry. To make up for the unseasoned omulette, covering it in the black pepper sauce did not help much as the pepper taste was overbearing. The rice beneath was meh... had some mushroom bits but other than that, nothing special. So not worth that I spent almost $10 for that. I also had the honey green tea creama which I thought was great (not overly sweet and topped with foam)! Setback was that drinks and meals took longer than normal to arrive and even the toast took 1 hour (which I didn't mind too much because it came after my meal).  On a Tuesday and Wednesday night, around dinner time, the cafe was moderatly busy. Both occasions I immediately was seated and was given the menu, water, and a pencil and paper to take down your own orders. It does take some time to flag someone down however... most of the waitresses hang out near the back, very few are on floor, and I don't know why I have to constantly have my hand up to be acknowledged...  First impression was how super instagrammable the interior was. Good job for their interior designer because apparently this place was newly renovated. Even the cutlery is cute.. the spoons were tiny shovels! And their choice in music selection was 10/10! Most of their song selections were covers of top 40 songs but with an electric/dance/indie remix.   I'll be back with a larger group probably for their desserts again."}
{"text":"What a cute little spot at the Congee Wong/Sunny supermarket plaza on Leslie/Finch. When you first enter, the decor is very Instagrammable, nicely lit and can seat a lot of people.  The menu options offer a good variety, but not too much that it would be overwhelming (like Mabu). They range from ramen to omurice to bubble tea and dessert.  What I've had (a lot, clearly): - Popcorn chicken: pretty basic, what you would expect from Taiwanese spot. If you love popcorn chicken and that's your go to, you won't make a wrong choice with this one. - Pork belly black garlic ramen: don't let the garlic scare you, broth and meat are yums (although a little salty). Generous portion for meat, not a lot of noodles. - Japanese beef bowl: highly recommended. I had always been skeptical of gyudon bowls in Toronto because my benchmark is Yoshinoya from HK. Happy to say that this surprisingly hit the spot. - Mango crepe/pancake: light, fluffy crepe. Mangoes were a bit sour because it was off season, curious to try again during the summer to see if quality would be better. - Mango toast: this is what Petit Potato was originally known for. Caution: do not order this if you've had a massive dinner. This is meant to be shared between 3-4 people (painfully speaking from experience). Don't get me wrong, it's quite good, but not when you have to eat 2-3x an average portion.  Also, take note of their utensils. They look like pitchforks. Super cute.  Overall would come back whenever we are in the area and are looking for a dinner place with a sweet touch of dessert options."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant on Instagram after fellow Toronto foodies tagged this dessert place. It is unfair to just categorize them as a dessert restaurant as they do offer other entrees. My parents and I intended to try the 10\" high thick toast dessert, but once we were there, we were quite intimidated by the volume of the whole dessert so we went with something else. We went with a mango roll - which was fresh mango rolled in a layer of little almond flavour wrapper, super tasty and not heavy at all. We also ordered the mango/fruit sago. Again, not heavy and very tasty. We also ordered a milk green tea. It was not sweet but the tea was so fragrant, very enjoyable. I think the advise here is, you probably can't go wrong with anything you order, but the toast dessert is quite large and you get 3 very thick pieces of toasts, so you could get very full from it. Definitely a dessert to share in a group! I would definitely, return to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Usually come here for their toast tower and a light meal. Prices here add up really quickly. Drinks are usually around the $6.99 mark.  We ordered the mango toast tower, iced honey chrysanthemum and rose tea, deep fried milk pudding, and some chicken thing that my mom got.   The quality of the food is inconsistent and a bit overpriced. For example, my iced flower tea tastes different every single time I visited and I have to ask them to adjust the sweetness.   The savoury food is a hit or miss as well. The omurice that I tried was really good!! I would give that a 5/5 stars simply because I would reorder this dish every time. I have no complaints about it.   I didn't try the chicken but my mom commented that it was really tender and flavourful.  The deep fried milk pudding is pretty standard and overpriced - go somewhere else if you're craving it.  Mango toast tower is really good imo for someone who has never had it in Asia. Bit expensive, but you can share this with maybe 4 other people as a dessert or share it between 2 people if you're really hungry. It is super tasty, but then what food isn't when it's covered in butter then toasted, drizzled with mango sauce, fresh mango pieces, and whipped cream?  Overall, it's a great hangout place for friends, but don't expect outstanding food from their menu. I usually just stick with what I know is good and it keeps me returning back to this place.  TL;dr great hangout for friends, but bill adds up really quickly. Food is a hit or miss, but it has a great ambience."}
{"text":"Had to come here based on all the photos that I've seen on IG - I was rather disappointed with my experience though.... but keep in mind that I did not order any dessert this time.   I ordered the steamed rice rolls, Japanese gyoza, pork cutlet omurice and sliced beef teppan. My favourite is definitely the beef teppan! I added Kim chi and fried egg with it which blended the flavours of the dish together really well - just enough Kim chi to keep it a tad sour, just enough soy sauce (?) to give it a saltier taste and the egg and the rice complimented all the different ingredients and flavours.   I was most excited for the steamed rice rolls, yet this was the dish I enjoyed the least. I didn't expect it to taste so.... peanut butter-y? LOL I'm not a big fan of peanut butter and maybe if they added less of it it would've tasted a lot better. My friend and I didn't finish this because it was just WAY too much peanut butter. It was too overpowering! It was like we were eating straight out of a peanut butter jar.   The gyoza was ok, it looked and tasted a bit undercooked though. Also instead of the typical sauce that is served with gyoza in Japanese restaurants, hot sauce was provided. It tasted pretty frozen, especially at the white part Seen in the picture I'll attach.   Onto the last dish, the pork cutlet omurice. The egg and rice was flavourless & the curry was so thick!! You know the sauce is too thick when it looks like the dish has been left out for so long right when it is brought to your table :(   Even though I really enjoyed the beef teppan, the portion is small and for the price that I had to pay for it - it doesn't seem worth it at all. If I did return, I'd probably still re order this and just try their desserts."}
{"text":"Came here on a friend's recommendation.  We had lunch special.  The ramen was good, and the Taiwanese style meat rice is also good.  The egg is especially special.  We then ordered dessert...but waited at least 25 mins before the desserts came to us.  The mango pancake was ok, too much cream, not enough mango.  The strawberry banana crepe was good.  The taro ball coconut milk soup was also good.  But it should not take 25 mins to make the dessert.    The place is very nice and beautiful.  Parking is a little bit hectic.    Will I go back again?  Probably not."}
{"text":"The decor of this restaurant is very cute, their utensils and plates are unique. I came here a few times and I would say to stick with the desserts. The food here isn't that great. We had the mango toast tower shared between 4 people and it was very filling. It tasted good but the mangos were a bit sour and I think they use frozen mangos, some were still frozen. I would come back for dessert only."}
{"text":"Delicious! A very popular eatery in North York. The good: We ordered Honey garlic chicken for appetisers and 2 main courses of Chicken pepper rice and garlic slice pork Ramen.All of the food was tasty. The chicken peppers were on a hot plate like in Taiwanese restaurants. Finally we ordered the pièce de résistance  the 10\" high Golden Mango Toast. Fast service. The bad: although the restaurant has many tables for a couple, this joint is made for groups of 4 at least. The ugly: parking. On a busy weekend hard to find a place near the restaurant. There's parking in the back. At least, the long walk will help reduce a bit of the calories gained. Tip: order the ice cream Toast dessert way before because they need 20-30 minutes to prepare it since they make the bread onsite at each order. Cool: you have a small shovel and a small pitch fork as your utensils. Affordable $$"}
{"text":"The quality of this restaurant has diminished as the popularity increased. The restaurant is generally packed on the weekends around dinner so a reservation is recommended.   The food here is mediocre at best. The ramen quality is similar to Ajisen, it is decent but nothing spectacular. The speciality here is the golden toast series. Although the pictures look great, the toast does take over 30 minutes to prepare so be sure to order it at the beginning with the main courses. The toast we recieved was very underwhelming. The bread seemed to be sitting out for a while because it was extremely dry.  The service was very inattentive. We had to wait 10 minutes just to wave down a waiter for the sheet to write our orders on. Additionally, my friend has to wait extremely long for his dessert even though the order was placed at the same time as everybody else's and we had almost finished out golden toast."}
{"text":"This is a pretty neat little dessert place. Lots of different options to choose from.  I ordered a mixed fruit iced tea, beef striploin omurice, and had a bite of this Oreo toast mountain thing I didn't even see what it was called but pictures provided lol  The mixed fruit iced tea was ok, but not the best I've had. I think the fruit choices could have been better for the infusion.   The omurice was not bad, I usually have it with curry, so with black bean sauce it was interesting but good. The rice was very soft, wet, and sweet. The striploin was ok, but the portion is a bit on the small side.  The Oreo toast was ok. Some layers of toast were really hard and crispy like croutons, done were on the softer side. Not sure if it was intentional but there's different textures from what I experienced. It's very sweet, so if you have a sweet tooth, you'll probably like it.  Overall, I think it's a pretty nice place to take a date and I will probably go back just because I saw so many things I wanted to try."}
{"text":"Petit Potato used to be all the rage when their brick toast monstrosity hit social media. It's still a packed restaurant on weekends, but not so much during the weekdays.  Normally I wouldn't come to a dedicated dessert place for dinner, but I was hungry and having dessert alone wouldn't have done any good.  Their savoury foods section is small, but it's to be expected. They do however have a teppan option which lets you choose your carb, meat and sauce.  I opted to try their Pork Cutlet Omurice with Spicy Curry Sauce. It was alright... The rice was lackluster - very little flavour, when it's the star at other places. The pork cutlet was fried well and the sauce is okay. Needs more spice for a dish that has \"spicy\" in it.  Their brick toast is still something to look forward to though. We got the Purple Yam Brick Toast. Subtle, but perfect amount of sweetness for a dessert. I find the others are a bit overly sugary with everything they put on...  If it's your first time, I would recommend it for the experience. Come here for the dessert and... just get better quality dinner in the same plaza."}
{"text":"I went here late on a friday night and wow it gets so busy! I think the busy setting makes the place appealing in my opinion because you see that everyone is laughing or having a good time. They menu has a good variety and reasonable prices. You can choose from a light appetizer, a full meal, a dessert and/or drink. I think this is a nice place to go late at night with friends or family."}
{"text":"Mainly came here for the toast tower, but ordered many things to try. Beef omurice was really good among other things we had ordered, but it took way too long for the food to arrive. Not a good idea to come here when you're hungry because you'll just be waiting around -- but then again, most of us only go to restaurants when we're hungry so perhaps think twice before deciding to go here. Good food isn't enough to keep my interest if the service takes over 45mins.   As for the toast tower, we ordered the strawberry one. Really pretty, but the taste was not as appealing as it looked. Toast tasted good, can't go wrong with toasted bread dunked in cream sauce. However, the strawberry cream sauce alone was not that great. Worst of all was the ice cream, which tasted like garlic. Perhaps they put the ice cream in the same freezer they put garlic, I don't know. We had waited over 30minutes (on top of the 45minute wait for the main dishes) for the toast tower, and was our main reason for going. After calling our waitress over to explain that the ice cream tasted like garlic she then called the manager over. I told the manager to try the ice cream because it tasted rather weird. He then took our toast tower away and tried the ice cream with his employees in visible view, then came back to our table and admitted that the ice cream flavor was off; but offered no customer recovery service to make up for the bad experience.   We waited so long for the main event (toast tower) to arrive, only to be disappointed and then presented with bad service. For this reason alone I am turned off from returning to this place."}
{"text":"Good spot for dessert or a drink. I ordered a huge toast with ice cream - chose the mango option.   Interior was well lit, fun, and modern. It does get busy so it might be wise to keep your board games at home.  Price is average - not exceptionally cheap but not outrageously expensive either. The toast was around $12-15 but enough to feed 2-5 people.  Food: The toast looks impressive and all but it's just how it looks. It'll get soggy if you don't finish quickly and it's just that - toast, toppings, and ice cream. It looks aesthetically pleasing but flavor is just that.  Service: adequate - nothing special"}
{"text":"This place is a popular dessert restaurant that serves a variety of Taiwanese-style drinks and dishes. Their most popular dish is by far the gigantic French toast tower covered in mango icecream that you've probably seen in pictures. Its definitely a novelty thing because although it tastes good, i definitely wouldn't order it again unless I was coming with a party of 6. Its just very difficult to finish. Other than that, the atmosphere is great and is a good place to spend a weeknight with friends."}
{"text":"My friend and I were excited to try this place. I found the seating a bit cramped as there were many long tables and that you'd be sitting next to customers but that was fine. I ordered the omurice with pork cutlet and shared a build your own pasta (fettuccine with chicken in a creamy sauce) with my friend. I found the omurice good but I didn't think they gave enough of the katsu in ratio to the rice. The pasta though was something that my friend and I did not enjoy. I also ordered a mango slush but when I drank it, it tasted pretty sour, which was unexpected. Overall, I should come back but only to try their known ice cream brick toast tower and nothing else."}
{"text":"I got the pork cutlet, with the rice filled egg. It was pretty good. Most of the dishes here are like glorified home cooked meals (comfort food). There are also dishes that are brought out on a hot plate which are also good too. The ice cream toast dessert (forgot the name) is good enough for 4 people. My friends and I shared the strawberry one and we didn't finish it but it was pretty good. Again, something u could make at home (literally toast, ice cream and some fruit) but it's made really pretty lol. I would come back and try different dishes."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend to try the infamous brick toast tower. But first, we got some real food. She got the veggie bibimbap while I got the pork ramyun. The ramyun was surprisingly good and not too salty.  For the brick toast... Meh. I was seriously unimpressed - I totally bought into the aesthetics and instagram hype. It was basically a tower of thick hard toast. covered in cream and mango sauce with frozen pieces of mango fruit and topped with ice cream. We were hoping the toast would soak up some of the liquid and get soft, but 15 minutes later, the only difference was that our ice cream melted into the puddle of cream/mango.  I'd come back for the food, but probably not the brick toast."}
{"text":"Was excited to visit this restaurant after seeing pictures of the food online. Came here three times and left unsatisfied with the food.  Food here looks better than it tastes. Large menu primarily consists of desserts which includes their famous toast mountain that's topped with syrup and ice cream. Sadly, we were disappointed as we had to wait half an hour to receive toast that left an oily aftertaste which made us feel nauseated on our way out.  Tried the sizzling plates twice and was very unhappy with the dish. Large, unreasonably-sized chunks of vegetables topped with overly-salted or sweetened meat will make you want to vomit afterwards.  Omurice was not as impressive as it looked on the menu due to the blandness and wetness of the rice contained in the egg. However, the saltiness of the curry sauce will make up for it due since the salt is overpowering.  Ramen was OK, probably the only thing on the menu that I could approve. However, flavour does lack in the soup."}
{"text":"Petite Potato was quiet during my afternoon weekday visit. Service was good and the food and drink we ordered came out at a reasonable time.   A good place to chill out and meet up with friends. The menu is extensive. Picking just one item could be quite difficult, but I can always come back on another day. I do love the options of both traditional Chinese dessert and other new and funky creation.  Pricing is typical of Taiwanese Tea House. A little pricey but you do pay for the nice ambience."}
{"text":"Came here twice only because it happened to be right there.  The first time we got the strawberry special golden toast with a few drinks. The toast was huge and very hard to finish and super sweet. Would not order again since it just felt a little too strong and filling.   The second time we ordered puddings and less filling desserts like lava cake etc and it tasted great! We also got a curry dish and it wasn't too great. It was pretty blend and tasted more like a curry soup not sauce.   The service was also kind of slow so I will not be going back. But I mean it has a really nice decor and the dishes look aesthetically pleasing."}
{"text":"Came here during a Saturday afternoon and it was only about half filled.  We were seated immediately and water and menus were brought to our table.  The decor is very cute and modern looking.  Suits a younger crowd.  I've been meaning to try omurice for a while and I saw a yelp review saying they had it so I had to come try.  We ordered the pork cutlet curry omurice and a bibimbap. The food arrived quite quickly.  The pork cutlet was smaller than I'd expect and it was a bit dry.  Not inedible, especially since there was curry sauce.  The actual egg omelet was pretty good.  It was nice and smooth, not overly cooked.  The flavor of the rice itself was good.  I took a few bites without the curry sauce and it had a good flavor.  It's not just steamed rice but mixed with mushrooms and other seasoning.  The curry sauce was a typical Asian curry, nothing overly exciting.  I usually can't eat spicy foods but this wasn't overly spicy, but it does give a tingly feeling in the throat.  The bibimbap was disappointing.  Usually the stone bowl is hot enough that it forms a nice crust on the rice but this was basically just rice mixed with meat and veggies in a hot bowl to keep it warm.    After the initial offering of water and menu, during the time when we were actually eating, no one ever came by to refill our water.  I also saw a waitress coughing all over the place including into her hands before serving customers.  Some people aren't particularly picky about this kind of stuff but it was definitely a turn off for me."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 7 friends for after dinner desserts but they have a large menu that includes lunch/dinner items. Desserts are pretty standard - its just that the presentation is alluring and very cute (ie: shovel spoon/cutlery, the large toast desserts, and potted drinks). Two of my friends weren't really satisfied with their desserts though (one ordered a mango super sago and the other had a coconut tapioca pudding).  Service is a little slow as we indicated that we wanted 2 of one particular dessert; once the order list came out and only one was inputed into the computer my friend was able to finish his dessert before the second order came out.   The savoury food items for lunch/dinner look really good and my friends and I are interested in returning to try it out.   Overall, would come back for after dinner desserts as well as the ones who did like (including myself) their desserts enjoyed it."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for a simple dinner and awesome dessert. They have a huge selection of dessert from crême brulée to sago mixed with fruits. Their specialty that looks like a tower of toast with scoops of ice cream and fruits, big enough to share for a group of 4. It comes with 6 different flavour of strawberry, blueberry, mango, red bean matcha, taro, and oreos. This is where we go for late dinner and if we crave for some appetizing dessert."}
{"text":"Exquisite Desserts, I had the black seasame soup my childhood favourite. Very friendly free Wi-Fi. Steph had the bubble waffle with three flavours of ice cream (chocolate, mango, pineapple) I would go here again, especially since I live in the area."}
{"text":"Visited with my friend and his mom on a Monday. They have a weekly special of a variety of things, I got the sliced beef with rice teppanyaki and it was alright. I would have liked more meat, but the sauce they make u pour into the sizzling plate was good. I would've liked a better bowl to have poured the sauce with because they gave me a regular bowl and it got messy because there was no spout. Other than that, my meal was alright, on the better side. I would give it a 3.5 if I could. We also ordered the Oreo brick toast tower for $14 something and wow was it big. I would suggest sharing it between 4 people because it's a lot. Totally recommended! You get a lot for your money. It was also very delicious. They have a wide selection of desserts too which I will definitely have to come back and check out"}
{"text":"Ok this place is insane. The dessert they have is crazy. It's a Chinese toast tower with ice cream.   Food is good too. The braised beef with rice was so soft and good.  Great place where friends can spend time and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Chinese dessert place, very busy during the weekends. Expect to wait in line during weekends. I had their strawberry bubble tea, mango snow and mango watermelon desserts. All very good, but it can be a tad sweet. A bit pricey."}
{"text":"This restaurant is absent of good taste.   After eating here a few more times, I realized this place wasn't as good as I had previously reviewed. I've visited this restaurant a number of times and have tried a variety of things that had piqued my interest:  - deep fried chicken cartilage (ok) - popcorn chicken (ok) - beef striploin steak omurice w/ black curry sauce (unimpressive) - pork cutlet omurice w/ spicy curry sauce (mediocre) - seafood omurice w/ tomato sauce (bad) - slice pork ramen (tasteless) - tender pork rib ramen (delish meat, tasteless ramen) - black garlic slice pork ramen (good)* - beef bowl in Japanese style (bad) - strawberry & chocolate hazelnut crepe (mouth of nutella)  - mixed fruit waffle w/ ice cream (mediocre, not worth)  - house special milk pudding (...i expected pudding in a cup, it came as tofu looking blocks of milk, it has a rich milk taste, but I'm not fond of the texture at all) - creme caramel (bad, i choked while eating) - house special super golden sago mixed w/ mango ice cream (bad, not fresh, not cold enough)  - fresh mango snowflake (too sweet, mouth full of sugar)  - several of my friends have tried their brick toast tower and commented that its nothing noteworthy-really, its just for the photos ;)  The service is horrible, with all the waiters available, you'd think at least one of them would service me. :(  For a fact, it's cute (i love the shovel spoons and cute plates), very aesthetically pleasing. n.n  *The only dish I'd recommend is their black sesame slice pork ramen, it has a good portion and a good taste compared to all the other options on the menu! :)"}
{"text":"Tip: the famous toast tower, do not try is if you got at least 5 people  Went to there with a group friends, there is 5 of us, so tried the famous toast tower. It costs about 15, it took about 40 mins to make. OMG, it was huge, it took 5 of us to finish it, loaded with calories, sugar and carbs. It was super filling. I gained 2 pounds because of this. I saw other table with 2 people ordered the toast tower, none of them could finish it.  This place is not a dessert place. I looked at its menu, from ramen to savoury dishes. I got variety. I tried the ramen dish, it was not bad. The service was pretty good, we sat there for 3 hours and waiters were nice to us."}
{"text":"Welp, the salt was good.  No, but seriously, every time I've been here I've been thoroughly disappointed to the point of being angry. The first time I came here was during lunch time with 5 other friends. The wait for our orders took almost an hour which is ridiculous considering we ordered very simple dishes like the tofu salad. The second time I came was for dinner and we got the Spicy Chicken on the Sizzling Plate and the Beef with Satay Sauce on a Sizzling Plate, which was one of their recommended dishes.   Let's start with the chicken. Almost all the chicken that was touching the sizzling plate was burnt to the point that we couldn't eat it. The ones that weren't burnt were actually tasteless. The only way we salvaged it was by asking for a saltshaker to season the chicken. In the end we just put salt on the rice and ate that instead. To my disbelief the beef was even worse. You can tell they used the frozen hot pot beef. Even with sauce smothering the dish, the beef was tasteless. Also, half the dish was just slices of onions. Totally not worth it for $11 per dish. I could cook something better in 5 minutes.  I come here only when my friends want to meet somewhere close and convenient but I probably won't be coming back again unless I'm dragged."}
{"text":"This place is only good for pictures. Omurice with eel on top. So underwhelming. Very disappointing actually. The egg was too thick, the rice inside was hard and no taste, just plain rice. The only taste was from the packaged eel sauce. The so called bibimbap was also tasteless aside from the kimchi. The ramen was fine I suppose. The bbq pork was sliced so thin it fell apart when you pick them up. That toast tower thing that they make you wait for 30 minutes for was... speechless. It was not worth waiting or the $15. Basically a waste of bread. Oh and they entered our order wrong so we had to wait extra long. Instead of apologizing for it, the guy said \"it's okay.\""}
{"text":"The first stop of my 3 day Toronto trip.   Came on a Wednesday during lunch with my SO and his brother. Parking was difficult to find, but it's doable.   The decor is super duper cute. Little shovel spoon? Yes please!   The menu is 1/3 salty and 2/3 sweet (desserts and such). I had the bibimbap that came with a drink which is a lunch special.   I've never had bibimbap before, but it was quite tasty! For a 10$ meal, the portion was surprisingly big! They definitely didn't cheap out.   My SO's ramen came very quickly, but the rest of us had to wait about 10-15min after his ramen came to receive our food. That was a little annoying, since his food was cold by the time he started eating.   The staff was very okay. They did their job, took our orders promptly and refilled our drinks, but they did not smile and they didn't seem very interested in their work.   10/10 would go back to try the rest of the menu and some of the sweet stuff, but I wish the staff was a bit friendlier."}
{"text":"A mountain of ice cream that's 10 inches tall.  It's every dessert lover's fantasy, right?!  Lol  6 of us decided to order red bean matcha ice cream with 3 thick toasts at the base to share.  Supposedly it takes 30 minutes to prepare, so we ordered it at the same time when we ordered our main courses. I ordered spicy curry pork cutlet omurice for $12.  The white rice was wrapped up in an egg omelet with pieces of pork slices on top.  Almost everything was covered in curry sauce.  The sauce was mild instead of spicy.  The quantity of pork slices were not generous in portion.  By the time when i finished the meal, i was left still not full.  I think for $12 i would prefer going for a traditional breakfast of bacon and eggs etc.  At least that's more filling.  My friend ordered pasta with cream sauce.  She was disappointed that there was no taste to the entree.  We all thought there was not enough sauce to cover the pasta. Finally the dessert came.    What could go wrong with ice cream?!  Thankfully nothing lol.     And the toasts were crispy and light.  There were additional sauce on the plate for dipping your toast pieces in.  It was nice that the sauce and the ice cream were not too sweet.  Between the 6 of us, we only had to pay $3.50 each for this dessert.  Pretty awesome!  I wouldn't mind coming back to try the mango flavored one."}
{"text":"We arrived on a Saturday around 7pm and were seated at a table for 2 immediately. There was an empty table for 4 beside us, and a booth that could sit 4 that was reserved. Their menus are quite unique since they look like the stick you use to put pizza in a stove. As for the content, I noticed it was mostly Japanese food (omurice, ramen) but they also have Chinese (the desserts mostly) and Korean (bibambap) food.   My partner ordered the Beef Omurice with Black Pepper for around $14, and I opted for Slice Pork Ramen for $10.95. We finished our water quickly, so I asked one of the servers standing next to us for more water. He came with a pitcher and only filled one of our cups before he scurried away...  About 5 minutes passsed and my partner was presented her Omurice. We each took a bite. I've never had Omurice before but I thought this tasted fantastic and would definitely order for myself next time. My partner took two more bites and then proceeded to wait with me for my food, because we don't want to finish one dish before the other even arrived. My partner was slowly eating her meal as she waited for my ramen to arrive. I took pity and told her she could eat hers first. Finally, 15 minutes after she got her dish (no exaggeration), my ramen arrived.  During the 15 minutes, I people-watched the employees. They had 5 servers helping around, but I did notice there were some much lazier than others. As in, they just stood at the cashier waiting for someone to call them over rather than proactively filling cups or asking how things are. I mean, my glass needed refilling at least 3 times and no one bothered to do it without being asked to. I would understand if I was sitting elsewhere and they couldn't spot me, but I was literally sitting right in front of where all the servers were when they were doing nothing else (next to the cash register) It was annoying, to say the least.   As for my ramen, the Slice Pork Ramen was very tasty. The egg was cold though, for unknown reasons.   Overall, great food, but expect poor service."}
{"text":"The first time I had food from Petit Potato was delivery - I got the seafood ramen and steak omurice and it actually tasted really good! The ramen was not too salty, which is a problem I usually have with ramen. The omurice was delicious with the perfect amount of sauce and meat. I decided to eat at the restaurant another time and got the famous toast mountain and black garlic pork ramen. The sweet potato toast ramen was pretty good but definitely really sweet and filling. It wasn't too special since the ice cream on the mountain was just vanilla ice cream while the only sweet potato thing on it were little scoops of sweet potato. If you're not into sweet potato, it's definitely worth giving the other flavours a try! Just a reminder- you should order the toast mountain first as it does take some time for them to make it - around 30-45 minutes. As for the black garlic pork ramen, it was a little too salty for my preference so I wouldn't get it again. Make reservations ahead of time because it can get really busy there!"}
{"text":"Came here with my 2 kids and husband on a weekday afternoon. This place is in a busy Chinese plaza and used to be called Sugar. I liked the decor and how they used a cutting board for the menus, and the fork and spoon loom like a shovel and fork. I've seen instagrammers order their famous brick toast tower with ice cream but it was a whopping $17.99 and was huge so decided not to get it. We wound up getting a traditional Chinese dessert (sago and grass jelly) with ice cream and fruit for $9.99. It was very nice and light, with lots of fruit and coconut milk. I thought the presentation and taste were Good, but quite pricey. My husband ordered a beef rice dish around $10 as well but that was not that great. Service was great, I did like the decor and the plates were cute ceramics as well. Probably a nice place to have bbt and dessert in the evenings."}
