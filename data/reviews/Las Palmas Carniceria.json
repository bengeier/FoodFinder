{"text":"This place is a gem - one of the best little local joints within miles!  Taco Stand: I don't think you can get a better taco in the city - authentic - pick your preferred meat (or potato & pepper veg option) and load it up with all the condiments that you could want - best part - $2 a taco - its hard to justify cooking when the food is that good and that cheap!  Market: I love this little place - fresh produce, meat, and other items all in this little place. Need something quick, just run in and grab it. I have used it more than half a dozen times for quick needs or when I need authentic ingredients and don't want to hunt all over town for them.   I will be back over and over again...."}
{"text":"Easily the best $2-3 taco you can get around here - and better than a lot of more pricy tacos I know of.  The corn tortillas (not flour!  Much tastier!) and the assortment of salsas make this a delicious, cheap meal.  I recently vacationed in Austin, TX, land of tasty tacos, and Las Palmas stands up to most of those!   These are probably the most delicious and authentic tacos I've found in Pittsburgh.  Only complaint it that I'd love to see a breakfast taco with bacon and egg!"}
{"text":"Awesome--love thieir food! Authentic and reminds me of mom n pop Mexican restaurants in Denver."}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorite go-to places for tacos or just a quick snack in general. I seem to find myself there most Saturdays (it helps that there is a bakery right next door and a pita, etc. store two doors up!).    At $2 a taco you really can't go wrong!  And the do-it-yourself salsa topping bar is just really great.  You're always sure to get your taco topped just the way you want it.  It allows you to experiment with the different salsas as well.  The tacos are filled quite generously with your choice of meats or potato, etc.  I find that one taco is not quite enough but that two really fill me up.    I've never ventured inside the store but am always tempted.  Now that I actually feed the meter (one too many parking tickets!), I will definitely make it a point to go inside the store on my next trip.  The Jarritos drinks are sold outside during the summer and are the perfect beverage to wash down your tacos.  This taco stand is really a must for everyone!  It's authentic Mexican food, not that crappy Taco Bell stuff.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Pgh, hands down. Very authentic, lots of variety for a taco stand - and cheap to boot! P.S. When the nice man tells you the extra sauces are VERY hot/spicy, he's warning you for your own good, not challenging you"}
{"text":"Having just recently found a love for the humble taco, figured I would give this place a try on a tip from my new roommate. His review was quite accurate. The food put out by Las Palmas is tacos the way they are done south of the border. If beef tongue is on the menu when you stop by, definitely go with that! It may sound weird to you, but trust me, try it once and you will gain an entirely new appreciation for beef."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos! We finally tried this place out this past week and I'm sorry that we didn't before. So delicious! I had one chicken and one steak and my husband had the pork - all were amazing. Warning though, the hot salsa is for sure HOT! I'm not one for super spicy but my husband added it to his and for sure said it lived it to the hot label. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is a great and friendly store!!  There aren't very many Mexicans in Pittsburgh and I was glad I found this taco stand/grocery store.  I tried the al pastor and carne asada tacos...the were both decent.  Doesn't compare to Chicago tacos though, but for $2, they are pretty big.    The store inside, the clerks were friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to stop here ever since I learned that they opened the taco stand. I had shopped at their store several times and found several items I had been missing,  from my  years of living in California. I found the prices good and the owners cordial. Therefore, I was not surprised to find the tacos were as noted in most reviews ... simply wonderful. I chose one with pork and the other with steak and onion ... toppings were varied and delicious. My only regret is that I only bought two. The next time I will double my order. I sipped cold coconut juice from the store as the perfect accompaniment. I must confess that even though a couple of hours have passed, I have not yet brushed my teeth, I'm not ready to lose the faint aftertaste that is still teasing my palate. Go there! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"For South Hills residents who love a taco or ten this is the go to taquiera, hands down.  Like many, I've visited this taco stand countless times over the past couple years.  I've had their sensational, their great, their good, and their less than desirable tacos over time and am happy to write a review that is both candid and accurate.  Here it goes ...  The positives:  Competes successfully with Edgars leaving the other taco stands in Pittsburgh behind, Adequate selection of meats and/or proteins all of which change on a daily or semi-daily basis, Food is well cooked and rarely dry, their puerco and pastor are EXCELLENT, authentic double corn tortillas are the norm - cannot beat it, wide array of cart toppings, salsas, crema, and guacamole with spice and heat covering the range from mild to make your tongue melt, tacos are sufficient in size and well proportioned for their tortillas, truly mouthwatering food much more often than not to go with the jarritos found in the coolers inside, price point is exactly as it should be, in fact I may hit that cart up tonight with some radish, cilantro, white onion and their tomatillo sauce ... I cannot wait.  The negatives:  Really, there is only one negative worth mentioning with that being they definitely do not use the best cuts of meat often (though they cook what they use very well) and because of that their tacos aren't always top quality, no seating (or bathrooms) available, taco cart isn't the cleanest at times, like I wrote their food has been dry (mostly the asada) though not really often enough to consider truly a negative - I am nitpicking here.   So, to sum it up ... I don't think you can miss with this taco stand in Pittsburgh.  Obviously, they are busy and that tells the whole story.  I would say, though, if this cart was closer to the border they'd have to step up their meat quality (and maybe a little more spice too) to be considered good but in the South Hills they are the top dog and fighting for that moniker in the land of the three rivers.    Recommendation:  No brainer - YES, many times, over and over, til tacos are coming out your ears.  The only reason they don't get a fifth star?  ... Because this is a taco stand, not a restaurant, and it can be tough eating on the curb or hood of  your car."}
{"text":"Yum! Dinner on the run, grab a taco, you won't be disappointed. Everyone here is very nice and all I ate was their tacos when I was pregnant with my second. He was and is a very healthy baby!"}
{"text":"Like most I like the taco's and the store/deli. Better than u can get in the strip district IMO."}
{"text":"I'm from New Mexico so I was suspicious of these tacos... nonetheless they were fantastic! Carne asada was my favorite."}
{"text":"I grew up in SoCal eating Mexican food at hundreds of Mexican Restaurants and with Mexican friend's families, as well as from taco stands in Mexico.  These tacos are every bit as good as ANY I have ever eaten...maybe better. Also, in the butcher shop in the store,  you can buy prepared meat for tacos etc.  But don't take my word for it, ask the Mexicans waiting in line for the tacos. There are NO OTHER tacos in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Best Tacos in Pittsburgh.  Hands down.  Coming from California, we were seriously missing real mexican food and Las Palmas brings it.  A true taste of home."}
{"text":"Great prices even better food! These tacos are phenomenal they have choice of beef chicken or pork and you get to dress the tacos yourself I got a chicken taco one day and the gentleman working stand told me \"that's a hot one amigo be careful\" I've never eating anything so hot in my life and as hot as it was it was so good! I've turned my cousins on to these tacos and there isn't a person I wouldn't recommend these to! Rain shine sleet snow that taco stand is up so next time you want tacos or you want just a nice quick cheap meal look no further then Las Palmas! And the taco stand isn't the only thing las palmas has go inside they have fresh fajita mix produce a meat counter and like a million types of hot sauce! Go in and try Las Palmas"}
{"text":"This is the best mexican store in Pittsburgh, I try to go there once a week to get all my favorite ingredients.... key limes $2.39 for a 2lb bag... guayabas... avocados...1.19 ea... cilantro 99 cents... white and yellow tortillas... prices are very reasonable and the store has a good selection of mexican products, piniatas...cookies, bread, beans and salsas.... I even find my Takis here.  The meats are great... chorizo, cesina, carne al pastor... and the carnitas are very good too. They have tamales too for 99 cents each.  They sell tacos in the front and if you ask they will give you a free sample for the meats..."}
{"text":"Las Palmas is our go-to easy and cheap taco dinner. Seriously, it is about the same price as making our own. Las Palmas always seems to be open; I've been there late at night and even in the pouring rain. (They have a tent)."}
{"text":"Great food stand tacos! You can choose from a wide variety of salsas and other toppings. As travelers passing through, fantastic Pitt stop!"}
{"text":"Stopped by the taco stand for lunch  and had 2 beef n 2 steak w/onion tacos...they both were great...you can go inside and put whatever toppings u like in them...def will go back..good prices also"}
{"text":"Can't beat the street food. Double corn tortillas with a mound of chicken, steak, chorizo, eggs for 2.50 a pop. You can then fix it up yourself with  tomatoes, onions, cilantro, light your ass on fire salsa etc. They had al pastor tacos one day, love em. They do take cards you just gotta pay inside first."}
{"text":"This is my new go to grocery for all the Mexican products and produce.  They even have a fresh meat counter.  I bought skirt steak for carne asada.  The guy cut it to order and trimmed the meat up perfectly.  They had an abundant selection of specialty produce for Mexican style cooking.   Prices are very reasonable.  I will never again shop a Reyna. We priced a few products at Las Palmas Carniceria that we had purchased at Reyna in the past and noted a significant savings.    I am looking forward to trying the tacos they make at the outside stand next time we go.  They smelled amazing!"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos. Tortillas fried on the hot iron while you wait. A lively place, good customer service. It would be nice to have a few chairs, but still a great corner taco stand."}
{"text":"These tacos are amazing. Had chicken and steak and they're fresh the ingredients to add in are fresh as well. Price is great at $5 for two soft tacos. Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because I love sour cream and cheese with my tacos and that's not an option! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Muy bien."}
{"text":"I just wanted to say how incredible your food is and how beloved you are in our neighborhood.  Thank you."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's cheap. It's delicious. These are the best tacos in the city of Pittsburgh and you buy them from a cart outside a grocery store, not in a fancy restaurant. I eat here at least once a month and never get tired of it."}
{"text":"One of the best tacos I have tasted. I'm Latina and I have ate a lot of tacos in my life but these ones for some reason remind me of home lol. For some reason the ones in Brookline taste better than the ones in beechview or Oakland. I also love that you are able to go to the store and buy Mexican sodas and drink them while eating your tacos. A true 3rd world country experience in the burgh!"}
{"text":"Cheap and spicy, my favorite type of food and exactly what Las Palmas serves. $2 tacos can not be beat! My favorite is the rib eye and then the pablano. I have also tried the chorizo and the chicken, both good but the rib eye is by far my favorite. Pablanos comes in a cream sauce and tastes of cheese, really tasty and heavy.  I usually go hungry and purchase three, hand the man $6 and I am full and satisfied.   There is a self serve area for toppings, some toppings are onions, assortment of salsas (at least 3 kinds), guacamole, cilantro, lime, grilled peppers, spicy chili sauces (beware the brownish one is super hot).  You can also purchase coca-cola or other pops here for .25.   You can stand on the sidewalk or get it to go."}
{"text":"Great tacos! Love the guacamole sauce. Although it may look like you need to know Spanish to order, the friendly staff will help you out."}
{"text":"I have only been to the taco stand in beech view on broadway, but it is amazing. I always get a chorizo and a chicken taco. both are authentic street tacos and get all the stars."}
{"text":"Moved here recently and have been trying to find good Mexican food. While it's not your typical Mexican restaurant - they have several different types of meat for tacos.   Tacos were $2 a piece and the salsa, pick, and guacamole are readily available in the store. Tacos were awesome - we'll definitely be hitting them up for dinner again on a regular basis."}
{"text":"A great place to stop in for hard to find, long lost flavors of my youth, in Pittsburgh.  Las Palmas is nicely stocked, and seems to have become pretty well established, thank God, because food is bland without jalapenos, chile, and Cholula.   I usually make my own salsas at home, but they make a great tasting salsa verde, which is super convenient. And I didn't even know I could get ready made Horchata, until I saw it in the drink cooler, (even if it's made with milk)... Until I get back to the southwest, I'll stuff myself with pan dulce, menudo, and horchata here."}
{"text":"Tacos are ok.  I like that you can put your own toppings on.  The price is rite.  You can't  go wrong for $2.50."}
{"text":"Growing up near Chicago and in a Hispanic family, I am EXTREMELY picky about Mexican food, including street tacos. This place is spot on and couldn't be better! So authentic. You pay at the register of the grocery store (I didn't check the store out yet) and have your choice of meat. From memory, there was carnitas, chorizo, carne asada, pollo and bistec. The corn tortillas (only way to eat street tacos) are warm and made with lard. You can tell bc they don't break and are super amazingly delicious. I got cilantro and onion, again only way to eat street tacos and then went inside and added some of the little salsas they had in the salsa cart. It was cold, so I don't know if normally the cart is outside. Salsa was also fresh and spot on. Lots to choose from too. It was dirt cheap, another key part of street tacos and on point. Would recommend to anyone and writing this review made me want to go visit this spot soon! Viva!¡"}
{"text":"These are the best tacos in Pittsburgh. My wife and I have been on a multiyear quest to locate the best tacos, and this is it. Search no further. You have to eat them on the street but that does not diminish their perfection. Las Palmas has another location in Oakland that is equally as good."}
{"text":"This is the place for tacos.  Certainly fresh, quick turn over, and swift service.  All they sell are tacos, but man do they ever.  At $2 each, you really can not go wrong stopping by for a quick bite.  There is not anywhere to sit, but standing around is the way to go.    There is an assortment of condiments to put onto your taco, all of which you apply yourself.    Multiple types of meat, and a vegetarian potato poblano choice as well.    Man...for $2 I can not think of a better way to eat.   Give it a shot at this cash only establishment."}
{"text":"Delicious street tacos. At $2.50 each with your choice of meat, plus a cart of toppings, it's a great deal. The line moves quick, and the food is delicious.  I have no idea if it's authentic or not, but I'd like to think it is. Either way, it's a great spot for a quick bite and a welcomed change from a lot of other Mexican foods in the city."}
{"text":"Cheap. Delicious. Authentic.  Not much more you could ask for. Seriously, go here. You'll be super lucky if they happen to be serving the beef tongue."}
{"text":"These are simply the best tacos I have ever eaten.  Anytime I am in the area I will stop to get at least one!"}
{"text":"Best mexican tacos in Pittsburgh!! There's no place with authentic Mexican food In the area. The Salas are delicious, tortillas are so good and ingredients are so fresh. I love it here!! The people are so nice and welcoming.  Very friendly ."}
{"text":"Ii wanted an authentic fast food taco experience and finally found one. My wife suggested we go to the Las Palmas in Brookline (Sunday-noon) and we did. I knew the food was going to be a treat was when we discovered we were the only English speaking people at the taco stand!  Everyone else was speaking Spanish and we were the foreigners!  The owners were very nice and explained the different meats they are cooking. It was wonderful that I was able to select myself was toppings (dozen to chose from!) to put on. Next time we are bring two chairs and a table to make it a five star experience."}
{"text":"Authentic tacos that are so good! Steak, chicken, chorizo and a full bar to compliment that includes mild or spicy pico and guacamole. Excellent pricing and perfect, quick lunch!"}
{"text":"The best tacos in Pittsburgh!  Fresh authentic ingredients make the food really great!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome spot--so awesome that once I discovered it and some other gems in this area, I was instantly regretful that I didn't live in Brookline!  The tacos are delicious and filling, and the butcher inside the grocery is amazing. The meat is really reasonably priced and they have the most delicious, fresh, perfectly spiced chorizo I've ever tasted.  The staff are friendly and helpful. I had a really good shopping experience here and it's a great place to find ingredients for Latin and/or Caribbean cooking."}
{"text":"Best tacos this side of Albuquerque. The habanero salsa and the orange pico are a must. Get the lomo (slice of steak) for a unique treat, the other are equally authentic. Great tortillas by the way. Eat a toreado if you're brave!    This is a real taco stand, so be prepared to stand or take it para llevar.   The grocery is also incredible and a value. Stock up on avocados and limes. Order a thick cut lomo for the grill, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. You pick your choice of meat (chicken, steak, ground beef, pork and others) they place it in a corn tortilla for you and the rest is up to you. They have many choices at the salsa bar. You can go mild or very hot. All tacos are $2.50 each. They take cash or you can go inside the store and pay with a credit card."}
{"text":"Amazing, cheap and pretty authentic Mexican food. This rivals anything on the East Coast. My co worker introduced me to it, and damn. They're authentic as hell! Highly recommend this place, and for those of you who hate against these folks, you're rejecting a healthy, cheap and homemade meal that adds vibrancy to the city."}
{"text":"When I travel to different cities I like to find the most authentic cuisine that is way off the tourist trap path. That being said, you can NOT get more authentic then this place!  In search of good Mexican while in Pittshburgh. Las Palmas name kept coming up in various web searches. It was late, we were hungry, and we chose Brookline as the destination.   Upon arrival, I saw the store. Understand first however that I was under the assumption that there was a full restaurant on premises (because I did not fully read or understand the reviews here, duh!) So we go in, and WOW what an awesome market! I feel like I am in Mexico. I look around, go to the back. I ask the guy at the meat counter \"where is the restaurant?\" He says \"there is no restaurant but we got tacos around the corner\"... OK, off we go. I was expecting a little enclosed area, like a walk up clam bar of sorts. When we turned the corner there was nothing like that. It was just a tent with a guy working a flat top and a condiment stand. Hmmm, ok, lets go for it! The smell was amazing, the smoky grilled meat goodness pulled me in.  Hello, TWO DOLLAR TACO!!! I have never experienced a true street taco stand. This, is authentic as you can get, outside of Mexico in the northeast, I presume. Grilled corn tortillas with any meat you desire (pollo, puerco, lomo, asada, etc.) And all the toppings you desire as well. If you want it mild or of you want to burn your face off, it is all there for the fixin'...   A real rib eye taco for TWO DOLLARS?? I repeat... TWO DOLLARS??!! All the meats come from the butchery inside so I knew it would be good because I examined the whole meat case and all the cuts were top quality and above all, FRESH.   I started with two tacos then got another even though I was full because it was just THAT GOOD. Imagine that... THREE tacos stuffed with whatever you want, SIX DOLLARS!   We traveled across town twice in 2 days to stuff our faces with these tacos until our lips burned off :)  When leaving the city we went BACK to the store to take home a nice booty of authentic Mexican groceries - if I had a cooler with me I would have taken meats home too, because no where at home here could I find such quality and prices of meats like at this little store.  I would drive over 3 hours once again to gorge on tacos and stock up on goods from this store. I will bring a cooler next time!!  PS: I found some desserts in the cooler inside - I chose the choco cheese flan - HOLY WOW it was the most delicious flan I have EVER had.  This is truly a hidden gem in P'burgh. YINZ NEEDS TO GET THERE AND EXPERIENCE IT!!!"}
{"text":"Came highly recommended from Ryan Mendoza. My daughter loved the chimi changa"}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and sweet. Great tacos. Friendly service. Excellent price (2 for$5 - stuffed to the brim). Go!"}
{"text":"BEST TACOS! I grew up in Northern California and when I found this place I was so happy! They are really friendly and the prices are excellent."}
{"text":"This place is as real as it gets. This taco stand is located outside a grocery store, where there is a ton of foot and car traffic.  The soft fried corn tortillas are grilled on the spot.  There are about a half dozen proteins -- all which are great, and then essentially a toppings bar. There are a few different salsas which range from mild to super hot. I like spicy sauces and foods, and these were pretty much at my limit. They definitely don't skimp on the meats!  You can end up with tacos that don't quite make sense --- I wish they had some pre-made/suggested options.  Everything was very tasty and very real, and the price at $2.50 each is really great.  I still think that Pgh Taco Truck (when and where available) beats these guys on flavors with their off-the-shelf combinations, but these guys are a close second. These are better than Edgar's from down in the strip."}
{"text":"Las Palmas has the best tacos, EVER, hands down. If you haven't gotten a taco from here yet, go immediately! They make them fresh in front of you and are dirt cheap, super filling, and delicious. Something about their shells really makes the taco, in my opinion. They also have excellent homemade salsas. I love the outdoor street cart style and at $2.50 each, you can get full off of 5 bucks! I've been going to Las Palmas Carniceria for years and it has never disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the real deal, folks. Plenty of Mexican specialties, brands, sauces, seasonings, candies, etc. I stepped inside this place and was whisked away in a moment to a cluttered, darkly lit carniceria loudly blasting a duel between the Spanish broadcast of a Manchester United game and norteño horns and vocals. Its magical.  This place is a bit smaller than the carnicerias I'm used to in Arizona. But for a gem like this to be found in Brookline is almost unreal. There's several aisles worth of groceries. Here you will find Mexican cookies, candies, sauces, marinades, spices, seasonings, canned goods, etc. Dare to be different, grab something and try it. I managed to nab some salsa verde, carne asada seasoning, horchata mixand these little red/white/green coconut candies my daughter fell in love with. There's a cold case with plenty of beverages, chorizo, eggs, queso, etc. You bet your sweet bippy I grabbed several Jaritos. Piña is my favorite.  There's a small produce area with most of the veggies you'd see at any grocery store here. The only thing I noticed different was the napoles. That and there were literally pounds and pounds of fresh jalepeños. Not the typical half-ass, wilted, dying display you see at most grocery stores here in town.  The butcher's counter is where its at, though. They had about a dozen and a half different cuts of meat. Among those, there were about a half-dozen varieties of marinated pork. No carne asada, which was a bit disappointing. They did have the meat, though. And the guy behind the counter told me what seasoning to buy. Also back here, I found lots of spices, tons of different tortillas (corn, fried, corn, flour), and huge bins filled with dried chilis. They also had these pizza sized chicharones I wanted to grab.  There's a small bakery area with about a dozen different cookies, pastries and buns. Plus they have a large rack of Bimbo products. I got a big three colored triangle cookie for my daughter that tasted like tamarind, vanilla and cinnamon. She loved it. I also bought a package of tortillas. Not the tiny blinding-white tortillas that are flavorless, chewy and almost inedible. No...these tasty hub-cab sized, floury disks of tortilla love. The kind that you can actually build a burrito out of.  All in all, I spent about 20 bucks on various groceries and delicacies. I made burritos all weekend long. I bought a bunch of dried red chilis that I plan on turning into hot sauce. I also plan on coming back next week for another shipment.  They sell street tacos outside, too. They're expensive, $2.00 apiece instead of $.50 apiece. And there's not much of a selection, just carne asada, chorizo and carnitas. But they're tasty and full of meat, probably a quarter pound in each. No cheese on the tacos but there is a salsa bar with about a dozen sauces, plus onions, cilantro, limes, etc. Its pretty rad. Rad enough, for a few moments, to make me pretend I'm back home in America munching on tacos in the sunshine instead of this dump of a city. I'll be coming back often!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Pittsburgh !  The staff here are super and the food is great so come on people get your arses over here and get some tasty tacos. Every time I have been here the food is lovely and so are the people"}
{"text":"Very delicious.  Best tacos I have had in a long time.  Will and have driven far for these tacos."}
{"text":"Just awesome tacos and very nice people. First time there today and we both loved it. I went for the fajita taco and tried something I would never try, beef tongue. Both were great. I really like the fajita taco the best. My son had steak and also had pulled beef. He lived them and begged for more. I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"So I'm not a local, but we were walking around Brookline and stumbled across the taco stand outside Las Palmas. Not sure if this is an everyday, but it's at least there on Sundays. It's a simple operation: one guy manning a griddle to heat up tortillas with a selection of meats and a condiment bar. I only tried the chorizo, but it was pretty good. I added salsa Verde, cilantro, and pickled red onion to make a pretty yummy taco. I wasn't in love with the tortillas... They almost seen doubled up, but they're just too thick and dominated the flavor a bit. Otherwise, a great spot to grab some pretty authentic street tacos."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic tacos, this is the place to go! On top of the amazing tacos, these guys are more reliable than the post office. Even with the brutal temps this winter, these guys will be out there day and night."}
{"text":"I can not get enough of their tacos. I could eat then Chicken or beef tacos all day. So good!!!!! I'm lucky to live close to them."}
{"text":"Love this shop.  Great meats in the back, fajitas are delish, def spicy but I love spicy. Tacos out front are the big seller, and for a reason.  Go inside and check out the rest.  Super friendly, always kind and have a smile."}
{"text":"NO VEGITARIAN OPTIONS.  I am 100% on board with this place - philosohically. I encourage diversity, as in, everyone should have a chance at success, and I love that these guys are doing so great in my little town of Brookline. I love that it is authentic and that they have a great toppings bar to the side of the stand with tons of things to put on your food, including awesome hot sauces!  But, and this is a big BUT, and this is the deal breaker for me --- I am a vegitarian, and this place is NOT veggie friendly, No options for me whatsoever. F**king sucks, too.  Ah well, can't have it all, huh?"}
{"text":"These tacos were so good.  I went two days in a row...  Being from Atlanta I am used to authentic mexican food and this hit the nail on the head.   - Huge portions of great tasting taco meat for 2.00-  - Wonderful salsa bar to dress your tacos however you like - Everyone there is extremely friendly    Would be great if they had a few tables, but half the fun is the street cart atmosphere.   They are seriously wonderful and my favorite out of the dozens of places I have had tacos in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Authentic cheap eats.  At $2 a taco, you really get a bargain because these authentic tacos will delight the Pittsburgher sick of the watered-down Americanized versions of tacos commonly found in the Pittsburgh area.  High quality meats, authentic double layered tortilla and a fresh salsa bar will fill you tummy with delight.  Service is casual and friendly; however, since these tacos are best when ate immediately after preparation, you may end up eating outside or in your car.  Even though the atmosphere is lacking and there is no seating available, these tacos are worthy of the drive from anywhere in town and the wait in line, so if you find yourself on the south side of the tubes, Las Palmas is a must-try."}
{"text":"Coming from San Francisco and having a plethora of really good fucking Mexican/central and South American food to choose from....I was so disappointed upon arrival in Pittsburgh for the lack of anything decent in this food department that the only thing that kept me from hurling myself off a bridge was the difficulty I had trying to narrow down which bridge would be best to fall off of and during that tedious process I found las palmas and they made it so i didn't have to toss myself off a bridge anymore because their tacos were, are that fucking good!  Simple, inexpensive, fast and tasty!  I also like the big sidewalks and how close they are too the library and the ice cream shop."}
{"text":"OmiGOD their tacos are freaking insane.  They're better than those I'd had when I was in California, seriously.  Great.  Tacos.    Also they have pretty cheap produce inside and it's not bad!  I generally wait to get my onions so that I can pick them up here.  Potatoes are cheap too.    lololol one time I went there for graham crackers and I was trying to explain to the lovely and friendly cashier who does NOT speak English what I wanted.  She called another guy over and I tried to explain to him what I was looking for.  Then he told me that if I made \"sweet chicken\" it wouldn't taste good.  LOL.    I found cinnamon cookies and ran out of there, slightly embarrassed, slightly amused."}
{"text":"I have been visiting this location for 3 years and never had a negative experience.  I always get hot delicious tacos made right in front of me and the guys working are very nice.  I just started visiting the beechview location because it is closer to home for me.  The guy running that stand is awesome!  I love those tacos and visit him several times a week. I'm not sure you will find a better, more authentic taco anywhere around here for 2 bucks a piece.  Very well worth every penny. If you have not visited yet, you have no idea what you're missing."}
{"text":"A simple cash only taco truck in front of a grocery store that quickly makes you $2.50 tacos and freely allows you to top them with whatever you want. All the toppings are available in an open taco bar for you to access and add, at no extra charge. These tacos were terrific and I'd get fat off them if I lived here."}
{"text":"Really delicious tacos. Easy to take home and eat. The sauces are really tasty and allow for customization. The meat was a little bit on the tough side, which is my only complaint. It's a really nice gem in a very convenient location."}
{"text":"Genuinely good, friendly people serving up some bomb-ass tacos on the cheap."}
{"text":"I will drive across town for Las Palmas tacos.  (Grocery store, too.)  Only possible ding is that they don't always have their pork tacos - those are amazing.  Barbacoa's always available, though, and it's almost as good.  Tip: Just found out today that you can pay for tacos inside with a credit card if you're low on cash.  (They'll mark it on your receipt to show outside.)"}
{"text":"Probably the BEST food you can get in Pittsburgh with this price. 2-dollar taco filled with meat. Plus, they have a full fresh salad bar. Simply delish! The only thing is.....there's no where nearby I can eat this yummy taco at. Coming in a warmer day may be a better idea."}
{"text":"Las Palmas is amazing! I love the cheap prices and fun finds in the grocery store but the taco stand is the real gem.   This place is constantly featured on Pittsburgh's Best lists and for good reason- you can't beat the authenticity and value of Las Palmas. Each taco is $2.50 and you order the quantity of tacos inside at the grocery cash register.  I come here more frequently than I'd like to admit and they serve different proteins daily but they always (Ok, every day that I've gone) have a beef/steak and a chicken option. Sometimes they have chorizo, definitely a winner. My favorite parts, though, are the corn tortillas and the toppings options (lots of different salsas, etc to put on your taco).   Las Palmas' tacos are a great to-go option. There are no designated tables and seats (it is a taco stand after all) but there are benches along Brookline Blvd so you can immediately indulge if you'd like.  The guys here are so nice. My spanish is rudimentary but I order in spanish and they help me along. It makes my day.   Parking - if you've never been to Brookline there is ample pull-in street parking (metered, though, but the meters take coins or the app) and there are also parallel spots available on the opposite side of the Blvd from Las Palmas. Las Palmas is located right near another Brookline gem- Pitaland- so once you're done with your tacos, stop in there for some hummus to take home!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the Taco Stand & 5 stars for the market!  The Taco Stand + Top notch service and super fast. + I love the toppings bar--it moves the line faster and it gives me the chance to just try out a new salsa by putting it on the side. + The price.  $2 a taco is unbelievable. + They are open in the winter.  I've been here on some brutally cold days and they are still open.  Love it. - There's nowhere to sit, and these are not tacos that you are easy to eat standing up.  I'd love it if they put on a couple folding chairs even.   The Market + Fabulous prices.  Ex: I found a pico de gallo that I enjoy for 60% less than the big chain grocery store. + The fresh tortillas. - The corn tortillas only came in tiny sizes.  I was hoping to find something big enough for a proper quesodilla. + Nice cashiers."}
{"text":"AMAZING tacos, never know what they'll have as a special & the steak, pork, & lingua are just the best anywhere around, great street vibe in the evening, all kind of folks on the block getting their taco on"}
{"text":"A testament from a Mexican, these tacos are the BOMB! So, so good! Best I've had in Pittsburgh. I love the BBQ beef! Corn tortillas hot off the grill. Tender juicy meat. Plus, an excellent salsa bar. Wow, these things are good! Did I mention they are cheap? If you haven't been to this place yet, GO! NOW! What are you waiting for?!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Initially, I went for their grocery store and then I discovered their tacos. Hands down, it's the most delicious $2 one can spend. If you are looking for Americanized tacos, don't come here. These are authentic Mexican tacos. They have a selection of meats to pick from as well as a great salsa bar. I can't wait for Fridays.  Back to the grocery store, in addition to some great Mexican specialities, which cost much less than at Giant Eagle, they have a great little produce section with very affordable prices. Example -- limes were five for $1 last week. And best of all is their carniceria (butcher shop). Tired of bags of frozen chicken breasts? Try theirs."}
{"text":"Came highly recommended by my local friends! Stopped over for a quick lunch..wow this taco stand was amazing...pork chicken and beef done differently....BBQ, grilled, mixed with chorizo, chilli, pulled, minced...omg!! Took a while to make up my mind...could not make up my mind so ended up hogging like a pig...tried almost every selection they had. This is legit...authentic stuff. Tip...he is going to heat the traditional tacos on the griddle and put the meat on it...don't just go inside and loading up the tacos with the condiments. Take a bite and decide if you want any or what condiments would you like on the diff meats. You will be surprised how good they are just like that too! Choose wisely the condiments..."}
{"text":"I'll keep it short and sweet... Love the outdoor street-cart style. Quick, friendly, delicious!!!"}
{"text":"If you are craving tacos go to Las Palmas. Trust me, they are delicious. I'm Mexican American, grew up in Southern California and ever since we moved here I have been in search for a place that sells good tacos. I have traveled through Mexico and know all about delicious street tacos and this place has them. My only complaint would be the tortillas. They are not that great, they don't make them on the spot like I am used to but at least you don't have to worry about your taco falling apart. Everything else is amazing, the meat, salsa, all the choices you have to fill your taco with. I hope they stay there forever."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner after work today. We ordered the steak and onion tacos. The topping bar is pretty neat, albeit a little sloppyml. I usually do not like corn tortillas, but these were delicious and fresh. The meat was seasoned well, and the veggies added a nice flavor as well. The only downfall was the person selling the tacos was not very friendly, and we almost left after being ignored by him. Luckily we stuck around and had a great, quick and inexpensive meal."}
{"text":"Wasnt expecting to find street tacos in Pittsburgh and was in for a nice treat. The tacos were reasonably priced at $2.50 each. It took me about 3 of them to fill me up. You get to sauce your tacos yourslf and the gauc sauce wasnt extra! There's no way I'm going back to Chipotle after finding this place."}
{"text":"If they offered their vegetarian taco option all 7 days a week instead of only weekends I'd give it 5 stars, but that's just me being selfish. Two tacos and I'm very very satisfied. All for $4? The fixins are plentiful and tasty!    This place is the best thing about Brookline!"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food. If I could eat it all day every day, I probably would. Pittsburgh unfortunately does not have a huge Mexican food scene, but most of the places are very good.  This place is simply delicious. I moved to the city from the country last summer, and this was one of the first places my boyfriend took me on a \"date\" to. He knows my love for Mexican and he knows all the hidden gems around the city. They only have tacos here, but they are done perfectly.  I was a little weary about eating tacos from a cart on the street, but those fears were immediately subdued when I took my first bite. We took our tacos to my car and ate them off sitting off the truck on my car since it was a nice day out. Coke in glass bottles for drinks! The tacos were super delicious and unlike any other taco I have ever had. Really fresh and seasoned perfectly. The 2 tacos were really filling surprisingly! They have a bunch of fresh toppings for your tacos so you can customize however you want.  I will be back to this spot for sure!"}
{"text":"Thank You Las Palmas.  Thank you for answering the unsatisfied craving for quality authentic West Coast Mexican food I've had for years since leaving Orange County.  Thank you for being that cheap (read $6 for 3 tacos) staple quick food fix when I don't feel like taking the car or bike out to grab some grub.  And thank you for offering not only a great taco stand with a variety of fresh simple dressings, but also an always fully and freshly stocked ethnic grocery store where I can find hard to get items for a quarter of the price that competitors charge.  As I've watched you expand over the past 3 years...  just PLEASE do me a favor, don't lose sight of what makes you great!"}
{"text":"This is a little bit of a hike from my apartment, but these tacos are worth the drive. Huge portions. Great prices!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best tacos in town and the kicker - they're only $2 apiece!!  Don't expect any fancy restaurant you'll only find a taco stand outside of the Mexican grocery store with no place to sit but you will find the most delicious tacos and a condiment bar where you can hook your taco up with anything you want.  Where else can you get a ribeye taco for $2??  I go every week - so worth it.  I've tried most of them but my favorites are the ribeye and the roasted pork....you can't go wrong with any of them though!"}
{"text":"taco's.......perfect!  the store is great and stocks may items yo can't ind just anywhere.  when i want a wonderful assortment of  fresh meats......this is the place."}
{"text":"Tacos are now $2.50 with various meats available .  They no longer are selling tamales as they said they weren't selling well enough .  Bummer.  They were tasty. I have noticed that they over-salt the meat as they're cooking it .  Wish they'd lighten up on that .  That's my only complaint .  The Berumen brothers who own the 4 locations seem to be doing very well. You never see either of them at the Brookline location anymore .  I buy various items inside the store, some of the meats at the back meat counter and a lot of the produce .  I think a lot of the people that come from other 'hoods and towns never step inside .  You should ."}
{"text":"This is the kind of street food you'd find in any market or taqueria in Mexico...cheaper, chewier cuts of meats marinated and then seared on the flattop with onions. Simple and delicious. They were only offering the carne asada and ground beef ones today, so I'll have to go back for the tacos al pastor, which are my favorite. The salsa bar elevates this little taco stand above the rest, with a great choice of salsas, pico de gallo and thin guacamole. I don't know if they have them in order from hottest to mildest, but noticed the ones on the right were made from the more fiery chiles, so a note of caution for those of you who don't like too much heat.   The carniceria itself has a great selection of dried beans, canned goods, produce and dried chiles. The meat market is in the back, and, while I didn't buy anything today, I'll be returning to do some shopping. This Mexican market beats any others in Pittsburgh.   No seating here, but just on the other side of the fire station next door, there's a bench at the bus stop where we sat and devoured our tacos. Just like in Mexico City...  !Buen provecho!"}
{"text":"Street food has arrived in Pittsburgh!   This hearkens me back to the days of perusing San Diego streets in the infinite quest for the perfect taco: a lifelong endeavor.  I quite frequently visit Reynas to get my fix, but I must say, this is the REAL DEAL.  The stand is located in the charming, yet unassuming business corridor of Brookline.   The Grocery itself looked packed with delcious mexican staples, which I will certainly have to return for when I am feeling more culinarily inspired.  The taco stand....does not dissapoint. They have a variety of meats to choose from, cooked and marinated on the spot similar to Reynas. The meat is good quality, soft, and tender.  what sets them apart is a cheaper price point (2 bills!!!!!! per taco), and myriad of toppings available. Go to town. Seriously delightful, still not heavily trafficked.   I will make this drive, and often."}
{"text":"Simple. Righteous. My two words for this taco stand on Brookline blvd. I've said it numerous times, and I shall say it again. Brookline is a hidden gem of Pittsburgh. GO THERE!!  Las Palmas is just another great reason for you to go. I had two amazing tacos with a spicy pork and had the choice of a many different salsas and toppings. Las Palmas is a great little spot that everyone can come to and get taco'ed up and feel great., especially since each taco is $2.   You really only need 2 or 3."}
{"text":"The best tacos in Pittsburgh. Having lived in San Antonio for a few years prior to moving here I wasn't prepared for the terrible taconditions here, there are very few even passible tacos in the burgh. But Las Palmas is the exception, they are hot, fresh, and with the condiment bar can be made as spicy as you'd like.  It's good street food and a great price."}
{"text":"Las Palmas is an excellent little Mexican grocery in Brookline.  Whereas most Mexican specialty stores have a lot of pre-packaged food and Mexican sourced kitchen and laundry items, Las Palmas is, although small, a full service grocery.  Not only do they stock dry and canned goods, but they also sell produce at reasonable prices and, as their name suggests, they have an excellent meat section selling Mexican cuts of beef, pork, and chicken as well as pre-seasoned taco and fajita meat.  The glory of Las Palmas doesn't stop with groceries, however.  Around lunch time, they open an on street taco stand that sells some of the best tacos in Pittsburgh along with an incredible salsa bar.  On weekends, they also sell homemade tamales that rival those sold in Mexico.  If you are craving authentic Mexican food, or just want to pick up some quick groceries, stop by Las Palmas Carniceria."}
{"text":"Taco stand outside is very good. The grocery store inside is a little pricey for every day items but they do have some mexican specialty foods that are worth the few extra dollars. The.cheese and sour cream, to name a few. On the opposite end, prices on lemons and limes are much cheaper than other every day.grocery.stores"}
{"text":"For being immigrants and clearly having a known history of experience hate crimes (their store has been vandalized and graffiti-ed before). They themselves can be slightly racist. Being of Vietnamese descent, obviously I stand out a bit in a line of predominantly Mexican and Caucasian customers looking to buy tacos from their outdoor cart. They make it a point to bring it up EVERY god damn time I am there. Talking in spanish (which they do not know I can understand having grew up in Atlantic City, a cultural hub full of ethnicities. Having some very good friends of Dominican, Puertorican, Mexican, and Venezuelan descent and taken up to level 4 advanced spanish in High school) about how this \"chino\" really likes tacos and that its such a spectacle. And I know they're not just flattered that a non-Mexican likes tacos, they just think the concept is funny and amusing to them. And once, they had the nerve to make remarks like \"ching chong\" to my face, expecting me to fin it funny.   Regardless, despite the rude and insulting service, they still get a 3 because their tacos are amazing, along with their salsa bar. But god damn, have some class."}
{"text":"Since moving to the burgh from California, I've been on a never ending quest to find decent local tacos. This taco stand outside the grocery store doesn't disappoint! Tacos are cheap, authentic, and you get to doctor them up yourself with whatever salsas and toppings your heart desires. So far, I rate these as the most authentic Mexican tacos in the Pittsburgh area that I've come across. Note that as this isn't actually a restaurant, you'll have to stand around outside to eat them, but that's part of the experience. Also, if you're afraid of spice, avoid the orange (habanero?) salsa at all cost - it'll knock you flat on your back!"}
{"text":"Love the tacos that you can get here. $2.50 a pop? Doesn't get any better than that. The tacos are also freshly prepared on site and there are just so many kinds of meat and toppings/condiments to choose from the condiments bar located inside the store. Oh and did I mention that it's also a Mexican grocery store so that you can load up on Mexican treats and great prices for produce/meat/snacks? I will be back."}
{"text":"The best tacos in Pittsburgh.  I can't believe that food this good comes at a price this low.  Tripe, chicken, steak, chorizo, it doesn't matter what you get, and that orange salsa, I don't know what it is but even with how hot it can be I walk away smiling every time.  Oh, and leave a tip you monsters.  This place is a gem and needs to keep going forever."}
{"text":"This is the real thing here, people.  Real Mexican tacos on the street from a cart.  When you arrive, you must go into the market in order to pay before ordering your tacos.  They have three types of beef, one sausage and one chicken.  J and I both ordered 2 - one chicken, one beef each.  We also went into the store to get tortilla chips and salsa that you can buy homemade from the butcher counter.  Side note - the butcher counter looked amazing and I definitely need to go back to get some fajita fixings.  But I digress...  the tacos!  The tacos are on fresh soft shells.  Corn and deliciousness in your hand. At the end of the grill, there is a wondrous stand for salsas.  It is filled to the brim with the good stuff - pico de gallo, cilantro, limes, pureed avocado, tomatillo salsa, red salsa...  All spectacular.  I am never one that loves pico de gallo, but this was amazing.    Definitely the best tacos in the city and for $2 a taco - they really can't be missed.  Come to Brookline and fall in love!"}
{"text":"I've been to the las palmas in Oakland before, so I knew already that I was going to love this place. I got a ribeye taco with sautéed onions, tomatoes, verde sauce and an incredible hot salsa. The way it's set up is you pick your meat and add your toppings separately. The tortilla is amazing and you can tell it's all house made. The tacos are incredibly cheap and soooo good!   The inside of the little store is adorable- they have a Mexican deli, produce, Mexican snacks and candy and they even have coke and other pop in glass bottles. Adorable.   This place is awesome and it's a must if you are in the Brookline or Oakland areas !"}
{"text":"It's a grocery store. NO! It's a taco stand. NO! It's a silly novelty pinata peddler. It's really all of these things. After reading lots of reviews, and with a hankerin' for some delicious authentic tacos, the decision was made. It was below zero around dinner time, which made me wonder where they move this \"stand\" when it's frigid outside. Surely, they move it inside. THEY DO NOT. These friendly dudes were still there, outside the store.  Under a pop-up tent, just like in the Yelp photos. They were happily grilling meats and authentic from-scratch(!) corn tortillas. These guys are hard-core, and they put this same determination into their offerings. One of the guys told us that they're out there \"365 days of the week\", which probably feels pretty accurate when it's that cold outside.  For the anxious, here's the way it goes: 1. Stop outside where they're grilling. They will gladly show you the choices of meats (I believe they also do just veggies...). When I went, they had chorizo sausage, steak, fajita mix, chicken, and a few others. Let them know how many tacos you'd like - they're $2 each. I got three, and it was plenty. They'll put them in a styrofoam container.  2. Head inside the store. Just to the left, there's a salsa bar. Generally speaking, the milder toppings/sauces start on the left, and gradually get spicier toward the right. The guac is fantastic. The salsas are fresh and oh-so-good. The sauces don't disappoint, either. Don't be shy - load 'em up! I typically like my foods pretty spicy (ex: I frequently order my Thai food with a '10' on a '1-10' spicy scale), and the sauces all the way to the right don't disappoint. They're definitely on the hot side, but not overly-so.  3. (Optional) Stroll around the store, pick out a drink along the left-most wall. There are lots of choices - I'm a fan of the Jarritos drinks. Mango is awesome, and goes well with the tacos. There are some gems in this store - like nearly an entire aisle of just hot sauces, and lots of fresh produce. (The peppers looked amazing!)  4. Pay for your food at the front. Just let them know how many tacos you have. They're super friendly, but may not speak fluent English. Part of the charm and authenticity!  5. We were welcomed to stand in the store and eat our food, but we opted to take it home instead. There are no seats or tables inside, though.  I will definitely be back - for both tacos and Mexican ingredients for cooking."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend. And WOW! $2 taco w/ generous portion of meat and unlimited toppings! My only compliant is the quality of their steak. But hey, remember it's only $2! Just a reminder that the neighborhood doesn't seem to be very safe. And they DO take credit card. Cashier is inside the store."}
{"text":"Amazing carnitas taco!  At $2.50 each this was amazing.  Highly recommended taco stand!!!"}
{"text":"Love the tacos & salsas!  Though, my b-hole doesn't like when I get spicier stuff."}
{"text":"The tacos. Are amazing. The people are so friendly and hardworking. This place rules. Get you a taco! (Barbacoa is my favorite). Edit: the hot salsa is SUPER SPICY, just so you know. There are many great salsa options. I usually go with a tiny drop of the salsa picante + salsa verde + pico de gallo."}
{"text":"* Grab a fistful of dollars. $10 will be enough for sampler of tacos and a Coke (con sucre real!).   * Go here (ideally at noon on a Saturday when everything is hot, fresh and there are plenty of people to chat with in line.).   * Eat the best tacos in Pittsburgh.   There's no seating, but you can waltz down to the fire station to find a bench against the fence. Plenty of people can fit here. I find it's good to grab a few packs of the Maria shortbread cookies from the benevolent Goya company while here. They're good for post-taco dessert. Do not reveal that you're a Yinzer raised on Mad Mex by asking for sour cream and guac on your taco. That's tacky. Be the locally-eating globe-trotter by experimenting with the salsa bar. You'll learn to love your tacos with the fresh vegetables rather than the gloopy spreads.   Remember this isn't just a taco hut. You might also want to stock up on your chorizo and other meats here. You really can't go wrong. And the prices are all far better than Reyna's (bless their intents) in The Strip."}
{"text":"While nearby and looking for a quick meal, I stopped by the outdoor taco stand to pick up a few tacos to go. Despite the chilly weather, there was a line for the tacos. As I waited, I watched the tacos being made. The meats are precooked and kept warm. When you order, the corn soft shells are heated and the meat of your choice is added. When I asked the options, I struggled to understand what was communicated to me so I simply asked for 2 pork, 2 ground beef and 2 chicken. However, there were about 6 options including what I believed to be steak and a fajita mix. I then went inside to the toppings bar and added what I believed to be Pico de Gallo and a creamy guacamole, unfortunately nothing was labeled. I tried to ask a few questions to the cashier but she had some difficulty understanding me. Seems they could really benefit from a few posted signs with the meat options, prices and toppings. I took the tacos to go and shared them with my family. Overall, I felt the taste was authentic though the meat was a bit fatty for me. I also felt it lacked some overall flavor. For $2.50 a taco, it was a great deal but I would not go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"Sooo delicious. After visiting Carnegie Mellon and exploring Pittsburgh, we were starving for tacos so Yelp came to the rescue with this place. We had an assortment of almost all the different meats and all were fantastic. What makes it even better is being able to fix your tacos however you want from their salsa bar. I think I'd like my daughter to go to CMU so we can go visit her and get tacos :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best tacos I have ever had. Very quick service and the people are very nice. A ton of options and very spicy. There was a bit of a language barrier, but you can pay for the tacos inside if you only have a card and outside in cash. I had the potato taco and I went back for a second that night. The tortillas are soft and handmade and the toppings are fresh. Seriously, go there. $2 a taco cannot be beat for this quality of product."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos. I went around 8pm Sunday, and my only concern was that perhaps the meat had been more tender earlier in the day when it hadn't been waiting for me to eat it. That said, the meat was still super flavorful and hot and the texture was great, but I'd like to try it again perhaps earlier in the day. Had steak and chicken and both varieties were delicious. The tortillas were great, the people were friendly, and three tacos was more than enough to satisfy! Great experience, I'd absolutely go back."}
{"text":"Yelpers did it again, went here on the reviews the tacos were the best I've had in pittsburgh... Period Fresh add ons and cold pop! Friendly service right in the street"}
{"text":"My family and I just moved here from Los Angeles, where the best street tacos are found in the 'hood. We had been told about Las Palmas and decided to try it.  This place is authentic. We found a Latino guy making tacos on a grill outside the grocery store, and the fixings bar was filled with four different salsas, cilantro, pico de gallo, and onion.  The chicken was juicy and tender and my husband's carne asada was well done, just the way he likes it.  All this deliciousness for $7.50. Our next venture is to try their sit down restaurant this weekend."}
{"text":"Insert Cliché hole in the wall with the best authentic tacos you could ask for. I would pay $10 per taco if they charged it.  Gave me flashbacks of being south of the border!"}
{"text":"Probably the best tacos I have ever had.  They are authentic, huge, and cheap.  I had a potato taco with rellenos and a chicken taco.    Both were stacked food.  Double tortillas were necessary to contain the eye rolling deliciousness of the taco.   I am considering moving just to be closer to these tacos."}
{"text":"Love the veggie tacos at Las Palmas. What a simple concept they have going; you pick the type of taco you want (meat or veggie), they give you the taco with just the base (meat or veggie), then you add as little or as much toppings as you want. The toppings bar has about 12 different options to choose from. There's several different salsas, fresh limes & cilantro, avocado and onions. With so many topping choices you can dress up each taco different. The veggie taco I ordered came with potatoes and grilled poblano peppers. They even put the tortilla wrap on the grill for a few seconds to warm it up and give it a little bit of a grilled taste. And the prices are great! Only $2.50 a taco!! And just 2 tacos will fill you up. If you're looking for true authentic tacos Las Palmas is definitely the way to go."}
{"text":"Yes they may be bad for your Palma-nary Artery and yes they are too big to hold in the Palma your hand, but these tacos are literally among the 5 best tacos in the United States. There. I said it.  What to get: Rib Eye Taco, Rib Eye Taco, Rib Eye Taco. Why: Because I said so and I know things. Condiments?: Add your own. The salsa will kill you, be careful which ones you put on it. Try the milder ones, if there are any. Plus tons of onions and cilantro. What else: If they don't give me enough I yell \"Mas, Pal. Mas!\" And get dirty looks.   Madonna, \"Tacos De Las Palmas\"  Last night I dreamt of Las Palmas Just like I'd never gone, I ordered one A young guy with Ribeye on the grill It all seems like Mexico to me, not West PA  Tropical the Pittsburgh breeze No other tacos as good as these This is where I long to be Tacos De Las Palmas And when there's salsa on I get tingling in my tum It burns my bum and stings my eyes Your Mexican Ribeye  So when I say top 5 tacos in the United States please don't take it lightly. I've tried probably 2,000 taco places in this country (I'm not kidding) and plenty of those were the \"top rated\" places in one city or another. So I consider myself something of an expert. As much as someone who is not from Mexico can be. And si, I've been to Mexico a bunch too.Yo estoy enamorada con Las Palmas.  All the meats are good, some are great, but it's the Rib Eye that is a top 5 taco in the country. It's dramatically superior to any of the others at this stand, or the one in Oakland, or any other rival tacos for hundreds of miles. The next best nearest tacos are the Rib Eye at La Divina in Buffalo (not quite as good), and the Gordita (not really a taco) at Taco Nazo in Columbus.  Don't expect it to be like other street tacos you've had. Mexico is vast and has so many different regions which each have many different types of tacos and stands and shops and trucks, and there are so many different ways to do tacos. This place pre-prepares most of the meats en-masse and then dumps them on a large duo of corn tortillas (twice the size of the tacos you're used to, but still only 2 or 3 dollars), and puts nothing at all on them. Then you mosey over to the salsa bar, and add any one of about 10 different salsas and about 10 other different veggie-type condiments. Muy generoso!  People who don't like this Ribeye taco don't know what a Mexican Ribeye Taco is supposed to taste like. It's supposed to have this exact taste and texture... if you're very, very lucky.  Be warned. Most of the salsas will blow your head off. If they will blow my head off (and I can take it, believe me), then they may be too much for a lot of you. Ask them which ones are milder for a more gentle experience, both now and when you use the bathroom later.  The guys here are super sweet and doing a lot of work for little reward, so consider slipping them a tip which most Pittsburghese don't, I've noticed. Also consider popping into the Las Palmas Grocery Store, which is also wonderful, and probably should have a separate listing, so I can rave about the drinks and the trinkets and the meats and even the tamales they sometimes sell. Not to mention the soccer sticker albums. But since that would score a 5 too, I guess it's ok.  Don't miss the Ribeye Taco here, whatever you do.  Now I'm going to let Madonna finish this review.  Tropical the Pittsburgh breeze All the people Pittsburghese This is where I long to be Tacos De Las Palmas And when the salsa settled I'd run to the loo so fast It burns my bum and stings my eyes Your Mexican Ribeye"}
{"text":"Finally made it here yesterday. Tacos were fantastic! Fresh ingredients and helpful staff. Can't recommend it enough."}
{"text":"After living in San Diego for a few years, I was in desperate need of an authentic TJ Style taco, and I have found it here! They serve traditional street style tacos with all your typical toppings. If they man working there tells you a salsa is hot, take his recommendation and don't pour it all over your taco, because chances are, it's really freaking hot! I recommend beef tongue if they have it, but if not, chicken is my second choice.   No other Pittsburgh taco place compares to Las Palmas for me!   The tacos are $2.50 and 2 will fill me up. (Cash Only for tacos, cards inside the store)"}
{"text":"I really don't think you can find a better taco in town and it is just $3. There is a reason they have multiple locations. Tons of fresh toppings. They are awesome."}
{"text":"I live in Brookline and I love walking to this little taco stand in the summer! What's even better, is they're open all year long! LOVE these tacos!"}
{"text":"The taco stand has really good, cheap tacos. Lots of different meat options, tons of salsas and extras. Definitely worth stopping by for a meal or a quick bite."}
{"text":"Cheap.. Quick and Delicious!!  We made a quick stop here on our way back home last Sunday. Despite the freezing weather - there were few people waiting to be served. So, we placed our order and went inside to quickly checkout the store. In a matter of minutes - our order was ready. I got the ground beef tacos and my lady got the pineapple chicken. The variety of toppings and salsa which are placed inside the store comes in mild and hot option. The hot.. trust me .. are really hot :) but very flavorful as well. I think the hot toppings went really with the pineapple chicken balancing the sweetness and the spicy hotness of the sauce. The meat were well seasoned and cook to perfection.  Definitely worthy of a stop."}
{"text":"Las Palmas is so good that i couldn't even find a taqueria like this in my hometown of Dallas, TX during a visit. They are bigger and you get to add your own toppings which puts Las Palmas on another level"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, this place is not exactly meant for me.  When we arrived I was nervous they didnt have anything for a \"veggie.\"   I asked the man what they had that was meatless and he had this potato pablano pepper mixture and so I decided to try that.  These tacos are legit!  I have been to Mexico a few times, and these are the real deal.  No cheese, and the spiciest, most flavorful salsas!  I was impressed!  He warned me that some of the salsas were really spicy, so those are the ones I tried, of course!  SO GOOD! MELT YOUR FACE OFF GOOD!  (Yes, I was actually sweating while eating!)  My only complaint is that by the time we got home my tortilla was a bit soggy from all the salsas I put on it.  I recommend using the little containers, if you have a long car ride."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! I love the tacos here! They are the best that I've had in Pittsburgh! They have a grill outside with different types of meat selection and flavors such as chicken, beef and pork. My favorite is the beef (res). Each taco is $2.50. You can make a meal out of it with two or three tacos. I like going to Chipotle but this place has way better tacos and for a cheaper price. There is just no comparison. After getting your tacos, there is a salsa bar which you can pick what you want to put in your tacos.   There is also a little Hispanic grocery store. They have a variety of meat and veggies. I like buying the pre-mixed meats which you can just throw it in a frying pan and cook it very easily.  I highly recommend getting the tacos from this place! Only down side is that there is no place to sit and enjoy."}
{"text":"Short Version: Great selection of Mexican food, as well as fresh produce and other grocery items, at prices that are more than reasonable.  Long Version: Having moved here recently from Southern California, seeing a Carniceria open down the street was an exciting prospect, but I expected to pay for that privilege. I was wrong: prices are as cheap, or in some cases (fresh bell peppers, some produce and butcher items) cheaper, as you'd find at Costco or Giant Eagle.   Plus, they have all the goodies you want like Coke bottled in Mexico (real sugar! no corn syrup), Jarritos Mexican soda, and a large assortment of those delicious and hard to find items you might associate with Mexican food or things available in Southern California. This includes pre-seasoned burrito and taco meats like Al Pastor for very cheap prices.  The only imperfect thing about the whole operation is that some items that are stocked are stocked in small numbers, so occasionally you'll go back to find they're out of stock of something you were looking for, but it'll usually be there next time you go back.  Highly Recommended"}
{"text":"Best real tacos in Pittsburgh! If you want to taste authentic tacos then stop by. They have a great condiment bar next to the taco stand. Stay away from the red sauce if you want to be able to feel your lips after you're done."}
{"text":"These guys just gave Pittsburgh hella cool points.  They've got THE best taco around town!  Authentic Mexican street taco.  Cheap and so much meat!  Awesome toppings/sauce bar!!  Located right in front of a Mexican grocery store, you have to go inside and pay for the tacos ($2.50 each) and come out to order the meat you like.  These guys are so generous with their portions of meat.  All the thumbs up in the world for their beef cheeks taco.  Al pastor was great too (the mild hint of pineapple!  Gahhhh, I usually hate pineapple but it integrated so well together).  Looking forward to trying their lengua taco next time.  Did I mention the sauce/topping bar?  Yea, go crazy.    This is such a gem and only 10 minutes from downtown.  Thank you for providing us with the real deal!  Gracias!!!"}
{"text":"I am sooo happy to see that this place exists in Pittsburgh.  No offense to my hometown but I am a Pittsburgher living in the San Francisco Bay Area for the past 20+ years.  In California we LOVE our Mexican food.  The more authentic the better!  Unfortunately I still speak to family members back in Pittsburgh who have never hears of a soft taco and who still believe that the big U-shaped Frito that comes stacked in an Old El Paso box is the real deal.  This Pittsburgh is the real deal.  Delicious, fresh and authentic!  I don't hold it against them that they haven't yet tried to expose Pittsburgh to the wonders of tripa and buche.  What they do serve is awesome!  I'll be back when I'm back to visit."}
{"text":"They do have vegetarian tacos, their potato taco is delicious!! And they also have vegetarian tamales, only on weekends! A must !!!"}
{"text":"I've been here two times in the past month. The first time I had chicken tacos--seriously, amazing. It's just a stand outside where they cook everything and then there is an area with toppings off to the side--so many delicious salsas, some very spicy, some not so much, their pico de gallo is phenomenal as well as their avocado sauce. Most recently when I went I got 2 steak tacos. It's grilled steak, unsure of whether it was marinated or not, with onions in it and it was seriously great. They had a few other meat options besides just chicken and steak.. They have a ground beef, another steak option I believe, some type of spicy sausage (maybe?) can't be 100% sure because I haven't had anything else yet, but I can not wait to try more! There is also a store, the taco stand is just out front. Inside the store they have some pretty neat items as well, although I didn't get to look around as much as I wanted to. Either way, it's definitely a place to check out!"}
{"text":"They closed the grill at 9. Their hours say 10 and I called ahead and they said 10.  Got their and no food. Still love them when they are open"}
{"text":"Short of being in Texas or socal  this is as good as it gets in western PA. Excellent tacos and if you like flan your in luck because that is delicious also."}
{"text":"This place has the best spinach and feta pies around. You should also try their feta cheese. I, personally, like the domestic feta the best."}
{"text":"i thought i was going to have to live off of pizza, wings and hoagies once i moved back to pittsburgh...THANK GOD for this place...it's perfect, not upscale (it's a cart), cheap and DELACIOUS!!!"}
{"text":"Okay tacos and good sauces fair prices nothing to write home about. I don't understand how this can justify five stars. Nothing stands out as that unique or of such quality."}
{"text":"$6.  Three huge tacos.    One was pulled chicken which was noting to write home about.  I topped it with one of the really spicy sauces which had my nose running.  The sauce was awesome.    One was pulled pork.  Wow.  To die for.  So good.  I topped that with a milder sauce (I can't remember which one).  The pork was tender and cooked to perfection.  Plus the corn tortillas.  So fresh.  Squeezed some lime on top.  Fantastic.  One was chorizo.  It was a little heavier than I would have preferred (i.e., greasy) but I guess I kind-of asked for it.  I topped that with the avocado sauce.  It helped cool the spicy chorizo (and my still burning mouth).  Added more lime.  I would like to buy a chorizo and make it with eggs the next morning.  Friendly staff.  Quick service--they fry the tortillas right in front of you.  The corn tortillas are awesome too. You dress your tacos yourself."}
{"text":"I understand that food trucks are the new thing.  But I judge my tacos on the meat that is going inside them first, everything else is just sprinkles.  That being said, I tried 3 different meats that were going into the tacos, and they were all bland.  The big draw for people are the condiments and such that you get to put on top.  Otherwise, it is just a taco, no better, no worse."}
{"text":"First Carniceria to open in Pittsburgh in years!!  I'm Argentinean, I'm exited to say that they even carry asado (beef ribs) at a very reasonable price. The owners are great, make sure you let them know of anything needed (I have asked for tapas de empanadas); most of the items they carry are Mexican style foods and other Latin American countries.  They also have marinated fajita meat (beef, pork and chicken) spicy but not too much. Last time I went in there they were roasting a pork, my husband said it was delicious! One new thing I noticed is chicken milanesa, one more thing to try, very easy to cook and the pieces are big!  I'm glad we have the this butcher in town. My family is very happy. And I support local stores!!"}
{"text":"Happened to check this place out on a whim and I'm happy I did! Fresh and authentic and you can't it. I ordered a chorizo taco, which was pretty spicy so watch out if spice is not your thing, but if so it's amazing. I also had a barbaco beef taco which was pretty tasty too! It the price was totally reasonable. Definitely great for a quick, inexpensive lunch!"}
{"text":"I love it here. My stomach growls at the thought. The tacos, the salsa bar, the grocery. Can I move in? The produce is always so fresh, delicious and well priced. And the tacos...well...they're the best tacos you can find here in Pittsburgh. My personal favorite are the ground beef tacos but I don't think you can go wrong with any type at $2.50 a piece. Fill up your to go mitts with fresh pico, cilantro, guac and all of the delicious salsas that your body craves and you'll be set for hours. Remember, cash only at the taco stand, muy importante!"}
{"text":"This place is best. The best tacos I ever had. It's very inexpensive and food is awesome. Don't miss it if you're in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"So I haven't actually been in the grocer.  I was attracted solely for the taco cart that was cooking some wonderfully smelling food out front.  You can choose either flour or corn tortillas -- the flour will take a little longer than the corn -- for your taco and a filling of beef, pork, or sausage.  The taco by itself is nothing special.  The seasonings are rather bland and the tortillas are not homemade.  What really makes these tacos good are the condiments and sauces that are in the cart to the left of the grill.  These sauces are freshly made and wow do they taste good on the tacos.  Be careful, though, I have no discernible heat tolerance limit and so was scooping on the sauces and trying them with a spoon.  Some poor guy after me apparently took some of the habanero sauce after me and his eyes were gushing with tears.    Hurts so good!"}
{"text":"Lissen up folks!  You're really not going to get much better than this Las Palmas location.   The prices are extremely good, the taco stand is awesome, and they have a full deli. I am not aware of any other full service grocerias in Pittsburgh. The selection is quite complete - you can get anything from a selection of dried chilis to Salvadorian crema, and the produce is well priced as well!  There's even a full cooler if you want to buy some agua con gas or Jarritos!  When I need to find real ingredients (they also regularly carry fresh cactus paddles..) this is the true stop in da burgh."}
{"text":"This place is great! They have so much inexpensive (and GREAT tasting) food that this is now a regular place for us to come get food. We've tried many of their different kinds of meat and we keep coming back for more!  Also, every weekend (providing there's no blizzard) they are out cooking EXCELLENT tacos on the sidewalk. I mean, GOOD stuff. We always get a few tacos and head down the street to get some coffee and enjoy!"}
{"text":"En el sombrero negro aquí, tacos!!!!! No sólo para los Martes. Tacos real, sé Taco Bell está ok, pero este lugar huele T fuera de Taco Bell. Y nadie quiere Acos... suena como medicina. O un rap líricos, \"tengo, qué acos Acos, giddi bap bap\" de  los Palmas: los mejores tacos en el burgo, decirle al colega en la rejilla para conseguirte con la barbacoa.   ....Acos, Acos, Acos, qué!!!   Told you I was working on it!!!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Tuesday afternoon for lunch with my father.  I had noticed this place the week before whenever we went by and became eager to try it whenever I noticed its high rating on yelp.  Since I didn't go into the store, the only real thing I can comment on is the taco stand outside.  There was a guy behind the stand cooking everything as well as a condiment bar next to it.  Whenever we walked up he was just finishing up grilling some tortillas.  He greeted us in Spanish before giving us a run down of the taco fillers in English.  I ended getting three, one each of steak, chorizo and chicken.  He quickly made the tacos stuffing them very full.  They consisted of two tortillas with the filling which reminded me of truly authentic tacos.  Whenever I asked about paying he informed that I could pay cash outside or credit inside.  Since I had cash I quickly payed him and moved over to the condiment bar.  They had a number of sauces as well as some onions and a few other veggies.  I ultimately ended up choosing what I think was an avocado based sauce.  Once we were done with the condiments my father and I walked down the boulevard to find a public bench to eat our tacos on.  After sitting down I quickly dug in.  All three of them were delicious!  My favorite of the bunch ended up being the steak, followed by the chicken and lastly the chorizo.  The chorizo was the lone disappointment of the meal as I feel it lacked any spice at all but it was still pretty tasty.  The bottom line for me is that I will absolutely head back here again in the future.  The tacos were all really good and I think that they were a great value at $2.50 each."}
{"text":"How did I only come here for the first time earlier this week?  The tacos here are absolutely amazing.  You get 3 tacos full of meat for less than $10!  Can't beat that.  I will be coming here to get my taco fix."}
{"text":"Great tacos, great people! I love this little taco stand. It is right up the street from me. There are no tables, so you buy your tacos and soda, sit on the curb and enjoy! It is truly great and there is always a line for their tacos!"}
{"text":"I came here as this was the 3rd stop on our Pittsburgh foodie tour and it was cool because when I checked in, I saw had also bookmarked it so yay! Another Pittsburgh place to eat at crossed off the list.   I like the concept too - it's slightly upmarket street-food. So basically it's like there is a grocery store and then in front of this store is this guy who has set up a stall with his portable stove top and a bar for toppings on the side. There are like 6-7 toppings (and yes vegetarians get love too) and the whole deal cost you $2.50 per taco.  While the rest of the group was in line, I went inside the colourful store (love the piñatas hanging from the ceiling) and purchased x4 Mexican Guavas for .50 cents!! They also sell both varieties of cactus too if you want to try those out.   Anyway after my purchase, I got back in line and tried the chicken, the chorizo, the veggie and the amazing Barbacoa which was my fave. The array of toppings was also awesome but since there is no description- I ended up getting a pretty hot salsa inadvertently and luckily there was a avacado sauce available, which helped bring the heat level down. The veggie was also delicious- I wasn't a fan of the chorizo - found it too dry- but the chicken was decent.   Absolutely great place and very happy I had the chance to try it out!  Yelp Review 42/2017"}
{"text":"Excellent street taco and Mexican soda. We got there about 1:30 pm on a Sunday and there was a line people waiting to buy tacos. Great ingredients and toppings."}
{"text":"This place is seriously great.  It's a little stand next to the grocery store.  I learned about it from my roommate who is from Mexico.  She said it was the real deal, so I had to check it out.  Delicious tacos for two bucks!  The beef are my favorite.  They also have a wide assortment of sauces that are all a little too spicy for me.  I get mine plain, but they are just phenomenal."}
{"text":"Wow I'm from southern Arizona and I must say I'm picky about my tacos. This place would take on some of the best!  Very pleasant surprise if your in the area and love street tacos you must stop by!!"}
{"text":"Extremely generous servings of meat and super-tasty salsa bar made the detour from 396 en route from Virginia to Michigan completely worth it.  Lomo and carnitas tacos stole the show.  Fast, friendly service and the perfect setting at outdoor tables on a warm Saturday night was a food highlight of our trip."}
{"text":"It's amazing what measures I will go to, just for a TACO. I saw Las Palmas on the drive-by. Then I made an escape and while my henchbrethren waited, peering into the shadows from the safety of their car, I snagged a taco. Ah-hah!   I picked out the most colorful meat and said, my mouth full of drool, \"THAT one.\" It was a white meat, with an assortment of red and green vegetables and some string. CHEESE. I asked him what it was and he said, \"È__?ç___ã__,\" except more fluently and with more syllables. I couldn't understand it either. It turned out to simply be Chicken Fajita. At least that's what Customer A said.   The store is inside. Much goods there. Plus the salsas. Clustered around the salsa bar, were Customers A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J... You get the picture. There were a lot of women flocking to the taco stand.   And did the taco/fajita taste good? Absolutely. Best tacos in Pittsburgh I'm sure. I only wished that it wasn't my second brunch of the day so I could have tried more."}
{"text":"Best chorizo tacos I've ever had. Condiment bar is great and for anyone that loves heat, their selection of sauces is off the chart. Friendly, quick, and best bang for your buck."}
{"text":"The tacos are GOOD!! I was sad that the potato option had sour cream and cheese all over it (vegan that I am) so I ended up filling up tortillas with the condiments. DELISH! Beware though-- I have a very high tolerance for heat and their hot salsas made me sweat! A lot!"}
{"text":"Tacos all day, errday.   Tacos from breakfast, tacos for lunch, tacos for dinner, tacos for midnight snack. I could eat every single one of their tacos (and I have) and I can because it's only 2.50 a taco.    I've only set foot in their grocery store to pay for my tacos."}
{"text":"PSA this is a taco stand in front of a grocery store, nonetheless we had the BEST tacos here, I got the pork tacos, they were 2 for $5 and they have a whole bar of fresh toppings...we will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I grew up In Los Angeles and spent the better part of 25 years enjoying authentic Mexican food. The tacos at Las Palmas are the real deal! The salsas are excellent. They also have onions, cilantro, guacamole, lime and roasted jalapenos. They don't advertise it, but they have cuts of ribeye hidden under the steak! It's hard to believe you can get a delicious ribeye taco for $2.50!  The store is great too! They have a meat deli with marinated fajita mix, fresh chorizo, skirt steak, ribeye and pork. The prices are very reasonable. If you are a fan of Mexican food and authentic street tacos, you have to try Las Palmas."}
{"text":"Folks, this is the real deal street tacos. Americans think tacos are something you get at Taco Bell. Negative, go here and appreciate what true tacos are all about. Plus the fresh salsa, pico, cilantro, limes etc. A hidden, authentic true gem in the burgh."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos and a great store filled with items you can't find anywhere else in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Drove an hour just to come here for Mexican ingredients not carried in the grocery stores where I live. The tacos were a bonus. Some of the best tacos I have had in a loooooong time. These are authentic Mexican tacos. Please do not complain that there is no seating this is a TACO STAND I repeat this is a TACO STAND. These tacos are typically eaten standing up in Mexico."}
{"text":"Some of the best street tacos around - originally from the West Coast, these are some of the most legit tacos around. Grilled right outside rain or shine and there's always a line (sometimes longer than others) so you know it's well loved! The salsa bar is also official, just watch out for the orange habanero salsa, yikes!"}
{"text":"I really love this market. Although it is a little off my regular route of stops when I go to Pittsburgh, it is worth it.  This is great because 1-It is Mexican products being sold by Mexicans, therefore they are very knowledgeable on what they sell  2-The Carniceria(Butcher) This is the only place around when you can get specialty Mexican butcher items such as Arrachera for making Carne Asada.  3-The taco stand out front is superb!!  4-They have a lot of Mexican soaps and laundry detergents that I miss being able to buy from CA."}
{"text":"Fast.  Fresh.  Authentic.   What more could you want? This is quickly becoming a regular stop for an evening meal."}
{"text":"This is a taco stand that is out front of a Hispanic grocery store. It is opened every day at 11am and stays open until 8 or 9-however late the store is open. Tacos are two for $5. You choose which protein you want-chicken, beef, fajita, or tongue. Then there is a condiment section with salsas ranging from super spicy to mild. They also have pico and lime slices. Simple but a lot of flavor!!! We usually go into the store and get a drink. If you pay for your tacos outside its cash only. If you pay in the store you can use a credit/debit card.  Great food any time of the day."}
{"text":"These tacos are worth a drive! They are fresh, delicious, and come with a similar compliment of salsas and and condiments.... The price tag is also wildly more affordable than similar attempts"}
{"text":"Update: within 12 hours my partner and I got the stomach bug. Diarrhea. Still, t here is no way in the world I am giving this business less than 5stars."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious tacos, and at a very reasonable price. This is pretty much the authentic experience (the main difference, of course, being that the meat is so plentiful, although that's not surprising for American Mexican food), tacos grilled right in front of you, a wide variety of seasonings. My only regret is that they're so filling that I can only get one $2.50 taco at a time, so it's taking me a long time to get through the flavors."}
{"text":"Love it here.  The tacos are consistently great.  The price is excellent, 2.50/taco.  The service both at the taco stand and inside the store is always friendly and helpful.  The store has a terrific selection of hard to find food and household items.  My only wish is that there was a place to sit outside to eat the tacos."}
{"text":"What a find! street taco at $2.00 each.  On top of that they have an amazing fresh salsa/condiments bar.  WIN"}
{"text":"It's rare that I'd get in the car and drive through a tunnel, just for a meal. This place has me breaking all the Pittsburgh rules! I was impressed with the people, the flavors, and the options. The fresh tortillas filled with great meat selections and then the bar of build-your-own options makes for a great dinner. Two tacos is plenty for me - so an inexpensive dinner that is fantastic is worth the drive!  Make the trip Pittsburghers!"}
{"text":"Where would I be without a Las Palmas in my neighborhood? A question I'd rather not ever have to answer. The grocery game is on point for all things Mexicano-style cooking, and much more. I for one love the ample supply of affordably priced plantains! The prices generally cannot be beat. Everyone who works there is helpful, kind, and professional. Not to mention the taco stand!! (See every other review on this page for a complete explanation of why the tacos must be tried.)"}
{"text":"I may have to go back and change every taco place I've ever reviewed... Las Palmas is now my favorite.  $2 a taco. That's IT. They are super generous with meat portions. And you can go CRAY on their serve yourself toppings. I had cilantro for DAYS. Salsa for MONTHS. Yumville population: me.   Cash only. Worth it."}
{"text":"My life would be incomplete without this place. My husband and i go weekly in the summer for tacos. The grocery store is great for specialty items for a decent price that you would otherwise pay much more for in a larger grocery store."}
{"text":"A friend  and I walked past here last night on our way to and from the Moonlite Cafe.  Again, I felt like I was in the Strip!  They were cookin' tamales and tacos outside! And they smelled SOOOO good.   We ALMOST cancelled our plans.   We also stopped in, said hello the second time around, and found that they are nice, appreciative folks. Get to know them."}
{"text":"Get in line for the tacos.  $2 tacos that are the best.. just get in a long line to order and plenty of fresh made salsa's and condiments.  Does not take long and the smells are oh so good, makes you mouth water.  Watch out some of the salsa's are hhhhooooooooooooooot!     Several slections of the type of taco: carne asada, carnita, chorizo and a thin rib eye or get a combo.    Taco stand is open on weekends and I think on Fridays in the summer but call to check out the hours if that is why you are going.  If your looking for good tacos or a mexican grocery, this is the place."}
{"text":"I have not been inside the actual store yet, but their $2 tacos they cook outside rock my socks. The pork is a winner in my book. And seriously, where can you get a filling meal for just $2 (for Grandma who can't eat a  lot in one sitting), $4 (for me), or $6 (3 tacos if you like to eat a lot!). I wish they had a better selection of toppings for the tacos, but the seasoning on the meat is so good, you don't need much."}
{"text":"Good tacos, yes. Tacos good enough to find parking and walk for, not exactly. Topping cart is unmarked, not too sure what you're getting. Decent taco for $2.50 but nothing to line up for."}
{"text":"Absolute best tacos I have ever had. My husband and I go about twice a week. Fresh toppings bar with any kind of salsa you could ask for, guacamole, fresh limes, cilantro. The pico de gallo is to die for. At $2.50 per taco, it's cheaper than cooking at home!"}
{"text":"Good mexican food of any kind is hard to come by in this city, let alone authentic street mexican food.  The tacos are dirt cheap, the guys working the stand enjoy what they're doing, and the self serve salsa bar is what dreams are made of.  It's pretty simple.    You choose a filling: carne asada, chorizo, barbacoa, pollo, carnitas, or potato poblano.  They pull two warmed corn tortillas off the flat top, stack them, and load it with enough to fill each of them individually.  You hand them two dollars. Well let's be honest, most likely you're going to hand them 6 or 8 dollars, because not only are they dirt cheap, they're the best roadside taco you can get in this city. Yes, even better than Reyna's lengua taco on one of their handmade tortillas. Close race, but Las Palmas wins.  Next, you step down the line to the salsa cart:  pico de gallo, whole roasted jalapenos, cilantro, avocado crema, mild salsa, medium salsa, hot salsa, habanero salsa, lime wedges, chopped onion, diced tomato.  The only additional cheap item I could think of to add to this salsa party is some shredded cabbage, but I sure as hell am not complaining. Grab some napkins and a fork and step aside.  They don't have any tables or chairs. There is plenty of curb space, concrete steps of nearby businesses, hell there's even a library drop box that can be used as a makeshift table.  Just find a place where you can stop for 3 1/2 minutes and make a complete mess of yourself.  The carne asada and chorizo are top notch, the others good if not great.  Don't sell yourself short. Go get a taco... or five."}
{"text":"After all the great reviews, we were sadly disappointed by this place.  Growing up in SoCal, it's always hard for my husband and me to find good, authentic Mexican food. This place seemed legit, being a made-to-order stand outside the grocery store. You pick your meat, they warm it up on the flat top and serve it up on corn tortillas, then you add your own toppings.  We went for dinner. First, there's no menu, but you can sorta figure out what is what. Second, everything at the topping station is unlabeled. Third, there's little street lighting. Is this hot salsa? Guacamole? I'm not sure.  Like everyone says, the tacos are each $2.50. We tried the carnitas and chicken tacos. They were okay. A little dry but good flavor. However, the carnitas taco was FULL of gristle. Like, HUGE pieces of cartilage in my taco.  I'll be going somewhere else, and I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"Delicious. Authentic. This place is fantastic! I was lured in by the smell of tacos and I was not disappointed. Great food, friendly service and an excellent selection of salsas and toppings. Wish I had more reasons to be in Brookline. Oh, and $2 per/taco!"}
{"text":"Fresh as you can get this side of the border. Topped with a bunch of fresh salsas and other spices"}
{"text":"Hands-down, best tacos in Pittsburgh. I literally get Las Palmas cravings and have to make my way to Brookline to curb the craving.   It's an outdoor stand, and you can order from a selection of meat. I always get the chicken. It's grilled right there, and the corn tortillas are soft and delicious. After your order, there is an array of toppings to put on.   Word of advice- if you're not sure, get it on the side because some are super spicy! They really fill up your taco and so I eat 2 and with the toppings, it's the perfect portion. If you're in the mood for something quick and delicious, this is your place."}
{"text":"To preface this, I am a Texan. And I grew up eating at taquerias in the barrio in Houston. Since moving to Pittsburgh, I haven't been able to find good Mexican food. I almost gave up. Then I came across a review for Las Palmas. I drove over and first noticed that the grill was set up outside with six different kinds of meat and a huge salsa bar. The cook was heating corn tortillas by the dozen and the smell was unbelievable. Tried a couple different kinds and was blown away by everything. Awesome street style tacos in the Burgh! I'll be back with the compañeros."}
{"text":"2 stars for the taco stand, 5 for the grocery store. 2.5 average.  My common sense told me to avoid the taco stand outside the store.  But my hunger told me to give it a try. I wished that I hadn't.  Two bites into the chewy, low grade cut of ribeye my stomach started to rumble.  That was all I ate of that.  Not sure if it was the meet or the salsa but something didnt feel good in my belly.  I will *not* be ordering tacos from here again.  The grocery is another story altogether.  I come from an area with a huge Latin and international population.  We have many Spanish grocery stores. None as well-stocked as this one.  I would definitely come back here to shop!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Pittsburgh plus inexpensive butcher shop in the back. Thrilled to have this place in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"An outdoor taco stand is definitely not the place to go during the middle of snow showers, let alone deal with parking. The only advantage is that no one else was there! Located outside a Mexican grocery store the man who was running the stand spoke broken English and it was difficult to follow him. There was a lady inside but she couldn't help me either.  I did learn that he has 8 different types of fillings for your tacos. They cost $2.50 each so I settled for a grilled chicken and onion one. It is served in a soft shell and he put it in a styrofoam takeout container. He pointed out to me 8 different types of toppings and went over the ones that were hot and the ones that were mild rather quickly.  According to him there is no seating inside the grocery store but I'm not sure if you could take it in with you. I hurried back to my car to eat it. It was okay and messy as expected. It is nothing extraordinary about it. I somehow ended up with a hot spice so I was glad I had plenty of water in my car.  It would be nice if he had room inside the store for this stand on foul days but it is what it is. If you go I'd recommend you take someone who knows a bit of Spanish so you would be able to better comprehend what he is taking about. Due to time constraints I wasn't able to go inside the grocery store. Located at one of the intersections of Brookline Blvd pay meter parking is available."}
{"text":"It is great to see the store develop in the way it has since its opening. The tacos they offer are the best tacos I have tasted out of any place in Pittsburgh. When I go there I typically buy beef and Chrizo. The toppings bar offers everything you need. If you like really spicy try the orangish sauce. (Disclaimer: I love spicy food so when I say spicy your nose will run and eyes will water)."}
{"text":"in the 8 minutes it took me to drive here from my office in Greentree, i was transported to my favorite Roberto's location in Las Vegas.  Had the lengua, chorizo, and beef...the tongue was the best i've literally ever had.  Robertos' always seemed to overcook it and it would be tough...LPC has it tender and rich in flavor.  The \"salsa bar\" was clean, and well stocked.  the hot Chile Verde...VERY hot, in a good way.  Definitely adding this to my regular stops for lunch."}
{"text":"THE BEST TACOS IN TOWN! I'm from California and this is the closet thing I've had to very authentic Mexican taco's here in Pittsburgh. And it's only $2.50 a taco! Very fresh and fast. If you drive past this in Brookline or in Beechview I highly recommend stopping and trying one of these babies."}
{"text":"Where to begin?!?!?  This is real Mexican street food here.  Hands down the best tacos I've ever had.  My boyfriend and I walk here for tacos as often as we possibly can.  At $2 each...  how can you resist?  A few things...  these aren't your Old El Paso taco night with your mom tacos.  Do not expect hard shells, cheese, lettuce, sour cream, and black olives.    It's corn tortillas grilled and filled with the meat of your choice.  Depending on when you go those meat choices vary but there is almost always a basic steak taco meat and ribeye.  They also have chicken, pork (my favorite), barbacoa, a potato/pepper vegetarian option, and chorizo.  It's your job to top them with the salsas, tomatoes, onions, and avocado they have waiting.    When you're done at the taco stand, check out the grocery.  They have a huge selection of peppers and a butcher that rules."}
{"text":"I had heard rumors about these delicious tacos.  But I didn't really fully understand it until I had them today.  Today I fully understood their deliciousness.    It's such a simple thing.  One stands at taco stand.  One looks over delicious looking meat.  One chooses between a couple different delicious looking meat including steak and onions, sausage and pork.   One receives taco and walks over to a neat and clean looking buffet of delicious looking toppings.  These toppings include salsa, salsa verde, gauc, tomatoes and onions.  One devours tacos in an animal like fashion because... they're delicious!  So for serious, they rocked my world!  And at $2 a pop you can buy a ton without breaking the bank!  I had the steak and the pork.  I liked the pork more because it was uber flavorful.  I also loved the toppings bar because I LOVE to dump toppings on as well.  Although at two tacos I stuffed myself and was full for hours (which does not usually happen!).    Do they beat out Reyna's tacos?  My answer would be they're on par but on different levels because they're just a different style.  That's just my observation.  The more taco stands, the merrier if you ask me.  Bring it tacos!"}
{"text":"What a delightful little grocery store! I bought some tamarind pulp snack. I love this stuff. You can find just about everything you need for Latin American cooking here. I can't wait to try the taco stand outside of the store."}
{"text":"Las Palmas is the platonic ideal of the ultimate mexican taco stand.  I'm normally not even a taco fan, but they take it to a completely different level, every savory bite is a transformative flavor experience.  Here is Las Palmas by the numbers:  1 other mexican restaurant's all-mexican staff that told me Las Palmas is where THEY all go out to eat  2 dollars is the price of each taco.  Each taco is actually wrapped with 2 hand made soft taco tortillas and have a double portion of meat (potato salad is an option for vegetarians), so it's more like 1 dollar per standard size taco.  Gourmet, fresh, delicious mexican at cheaper than taco bell prices!  4 is how many tacos I ate.  I ordered 2, left, ate them, and immediately returned to buy more to go to bring home for dinner that night!  10 is how many different fresh toppings they have, guacamole, peppers, limes, cilantro, onions and a variety of salsas from mild to absolutely DEADLY hot habaneros!  7 is how many days a week I'd happily eat Las Palmas tacos!"}
{"text":"Go here! I've been hearing about this place for awhile now and finally stopped. Excellent tacos! The most authentic taco I've ever had.  I was hesitant b/c it's just a taco stand, but it was worth it. Street food at it's finest!"}
{"text":"Love. Love. Love this place. The taste, the amount, the price everything is spot on. On any given day you can find your choice of meat in steak and onions, mixed meat (pork+chicken+beef), chorizo, chicken, mixed pork with pineapple. Everything is so so good and fresh but unfortunately you can stuff yourself with only two tacos or three if you are a serious eater, but two should pretty much fill you up. There is a separate stand for the different salsas and pico de gallo. Just one warning though, the salsas are hot and by hot I mean really hot. Being an Indian, I can pretty much handle any kind of heat but not the salsas at las palmas. You can skip the salsa and your taco will still taste great with the pico de gallo and generous squirts of lime. They have a busy oakland location too in atwood, but the brookline location is cleaner and more spacious."}
{"text":"Possibly thing the miss most from living on the west coast is the abundance of taco trucks. This storefront taco stand is among the best I have had in Pittsburgh. Is it better than Reyna's Tacos (Strip)? Does it matter? Not really because depending on what part of town myself in I would take either.  You know how taco stands work right? Pick your meat carnitas, chicken, or steak. Then choose your veggies. Simple right? Yes Simple! I like the one in Oakland too."}
{"text":"Best taco's I've had in Pittsburgh. Four meat choices. Real corn tortillas. Two bucks a piece it doesn't get better than that."}
{"text":"I use to live in Brookline and I never understood the huge gathering of people outside this place all the time. I got to see their progression from small blue tarp to protect their flat top and salsa bar safe from the rain to their much nicer popup tent.   The taco's are delicious. i have to say that the secret to their success is the home made taco shells that are beyond authentic. That combined with a pretty awesome salsa bar that could make just about anything taste good.   So the meat is just alright but like I said it's the soft tacos and salsa's that you go for. At $2 a taco you are sure to leave full and it's not going to leave a dent in your pocket."}
{"text":"Tacos are good and relatively cheap compared to fast food (probably healthier as well); one of the few stores in Pittsburgh that carries sugar-only Coca-Cola (not that high fructose corn syrup crap). That's actually worth me going out of my way for, IMO. The whole meats they sell in the back can be really good compared to mainstream supermarkets but make sure to keep an eye out for its color; sometimes they leave it out a little long (not often, though)."}
{"text":"Real good and real authentic. Don't let people tell you it's dirty. They are dumb and don't appreciate you and are holding you back. Dump your stupid lying friends and eat these tacos."}
