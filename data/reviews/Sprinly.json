{"text":"This is an amazing meal delivery service-all the meals I had were delicious and so flavorful-makes eating vegan easy! Unlike those places that ship you ingredients to cook, these are actual meals that are ready to go (includes instructions for heating either in microwave or on stovetop as needed) which is so much better. The price is a great deal considering you are getting a restaurant quality meal delivered to your home!"}
{"text":"Great delicious healthy easy meals.  We tried this because my husband wants to try to go vegetarian.  I suggested this because I like meat.  LOL.  He loved it.  It is easy - grab the meal and go - take it for lunch or eat it at home for dinner.  They are fresh, VERY TASTY - I mean like FULL OF FLAVOR.  I am not a big veggie person but that blueberry kale salad is awesome.     You order, its at your doorstep the following Monday and everything is marked (so ones that may be better eaten earlier than later are marked) .  Its a great way to eat healthy as well as get some delicious fresh food."}
{"text":"I love Sprinly so much!!!! I am a busy mom and was looking for a way to simplify dinner a few days a week. In a quest to find a healthy and quick option I stumbled upon Sprinly and I am so glad I did! At first I was quite skeptical as I am certainly not a vegan or even a vegetarian. But I honestly have loved almost every single meal! Everything is so incredibly fresh and tastes wonderful. My husband and I often joke that we feel healthier after just one of their meals! I love that you get to pick which meals you want from a selection so I can avoid ingredients that I don't care for (tofu in my case). Many of the meals require absolutely no preparation other than putting them on a plate but the ones that do take only a few minutes to prepare. I purchased the smallest plan which works out great to complement the days I cook. Even my husband is completely on board which is a true testament. The customer service and communication has been amazing which is just another added bonus. You can really tell the owners of the company care about their product and service. I'm so happy to be able to support a local business like this."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for this service!!   I am a huge fan.  Plant based organic healthy chef created perfection. At my door.  Fan for life."}
{"text":"Hi Yelp Community! Today I will review Sprinly. Today I got my first meals and I was surprised on what I received.  First I got my delivery on time as expected. It did not get delivered by mail. It was delivered by Sprintly staff. This name was Adam and he was very friendly and gave very important information about the meals.  It was packaged in a very nice cooler. It had tag with my name on it. Inside of the cooler there was a pack of ice and my meals.  While taking my meals out I found a hand made letter welcoming to the Sprintly. It made me feel like I'm not only a customer but part of a family!  I would like to say that I am not Vegan. Not even vegetarian, I love meat! So naturally I felt very nervios about the lack of meat. But WOW! The food was delicious!!  I can wait to try all my next meals.  I'll keep you posted about the future deliveries.  If you are thinking of joining Spintly don't hesitate on doing it! Join a healthier way of life!"}
{"text":"I tried my first Sprinly meal today- Osaka soba noodles with tofu and peanut sauce and it was delicious! It was a good sized portion so I felt like it was enough for a good lunch or maybe pair it with a side dish for dinner. I am excited to try my remaining meals-And  I would definitely recommend this service ( I get home delivery) for anyone trying to eat healthy but who doesn't have time to shop and cook!"}
{"text":"First Delivery food review below. More detailed company/customer service/presentation review on blog: http://micheleworthy.com/blog/review-sprinly  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Zucchini Noodle Pad Thai with Baked Tofu (Eat First) This was my first Sprinly meal and also my first time eating zoodles (zucchini noodles). I was IN LOVE. If I hadn't known better I might have thought some parts were actual noodles. There was a perfect amount of crunch and softness. The peanut sauce was delicious. The tofu was cooked to perfection and all the flavors worked together magnificently. I was slightly afraid that I wouldn't be full after eating a bowl comprised of mainly zucchini and tofu but it was quite filling. I would give this a 5/5 stars and will definitely order again.  Gluten-Free Pasta with Bean-Packed Marinara and Cashew \"Parm\" (Eat Soon)  This pasta dish was interesting. I've had gluten-free pasta before so the texture was not a surprise for me, but for someone trying GF pasta for the first time, be aware that it is quite different in that it lacks the al dente consistency. The bean marinara was also different but not unappealing. I don't really like beans so my personal preference would never be to put them in my food, especially a pasta. For not liking beans, I did find that they worked well in the dish. The cashew parm looks like real cheese and adds a nice crunch. I would give this a 3.5/5 stars with emphasis that I personally don't like beans. I would likely order this again.  Baked Falafel Hummus Plate & Mediterranean Rice  I love falafel and hummus so I ordered two of these my first week. They did not disappoint! The hummus is slightly seasoned and so smooth. The falafel was perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. I would give this a 5/5 stars and would definitely order again.  Indian Roasted Vegetable Curry Over Cashew Quinoa  This one actually ended up being my favorite for the week. It was so good I forgot to take a picture! The curry wasn't too strong so it wasn't overpowering. I've never had Indian curry with yellow squash but it was delicious. The cashews gave a perfect amount of crunch. This portion size is also slightly larger than the other meals so could last maybe 1.5-2 meals. :) I would give this a 5/5 stars and would definitely order again.  ?Sesame-Crusted Tofu with Peppers & Garlic Forbidden Rice I would give this a 5/5 stars and would definitely order again.  Bottom Line Would I recommend? Absolutely. Delicious, quick, and nutritious. Health is Wealth. :)"}
{"text":"I just have to say that I'm blown away by the detail and amount of effort put into each order! My first week of meals came with a hand-written note welcoming me and restating their dedication to healthy eating and being overall positive people (I believe a percentage of the profit goes to charity if I'm remembering correctly), but beyond that my meal was DELICIOUS! I had the lemon asparagus risotto and it was nothing short of amazing.  I've tried other meal delivery services in an attempt to continue a plant-based diet while working varied hours and this was by far the best I've had, taste and experience wise. I was going to wait until I finished my first week to review all the meals, but this first one got me so excited that I just had to do it now. The only thing I'd like to see if I were being absolutely nit picky would be nutritional info for each meal. Since Im stationary for a large part of the day working, it would be nice to know what type of workout I'd need to do that morning compared to my intake of calories for the day. Will update at the end of the week, but so far I would recommend this to anyone I know with flying colors."}
{"text":"Sprinly meals are delightful! They offer such wide variety of meals and options, you can go wrong. Every detail from the meal preparation and packing, to the amazing customer service is well thought out and executed. Their passion for healthy, flavorful, plant based cuisine shines through in Sprinly."}
{"text":"Sprinly is truly awesome! Ray & Mary, the founders of Sprinly are customer service oriented, smart and focused on a truly Vegan friendly experience!  Will definitely share with my friends in Ohio! Thank you for sharing delicious vegan food with all!"}
{"text":"Over the top deliciousness and convenience!   I'm a busy single working mom and just don't have time to cook meals the way I would like to. I also tend to over eat and grab not so healthy food. This is helping me with my health goals.  I can't get over how satisfying the food is.   Great spices and variety.    Love this service!!!"}
{"text":"AWESOME!!!  Hubby & I (and 5 & 7 year olds) have constantly struggled with \"eating healthy\".  The problem has been that we are both super busy and got into the rut of caving to the kids demands of nuggets and tater tots all too frequently.  We tried \"other\" home delivery build a meal boxes and were less than thrilled as we are both awesome cooks and never seemed to either come out looking like the photo or it took 60 minutes vs the promised 30.  Saw an ad for Sprinly and was instantly interested.  THEN-- Was surprised that they delivered to my home in the \"semi\" boonies.  We started with the 6 meal plan.  My husband (the skeptic) found it on the doorstep.  He opened it and immediately called me asking about the blue bag on our doorstep.  He read ingredients and dug in.  By the time I got home a meal was made and half devoured.  Then the request came---- ORDER MORE.  I emailed and we upped it to 20----  WHY NOT!  We NEED this.  More than I can say.  We need ease and health and Sprinly delivers this---- right to our doorstep!!!!  THANK YOU MARY & RAY!!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love my sprinly meals- as a working mom who is also an endurance runner, I am always in search of quick, easy , and healthy weekday lunches. Sprinly does all of the work for me- I choose from several options each week, then just heat and eat. At this point I have tried over a dozen selections- all delicious and very fresh."}
{"text":"I love Sprinly meals and I love their owners because of their amazing customer service. They are super responsive, willing to adjust to your needs and wants and I have never been disappointed with a meal. Portions are just right for us and the variety of meals and ingredients is very good. Their prices are pretty comparable with other plant based delivered meals I have been researching, but unfortunately, it is still more expensive than cooking yourself at home (which is to be expected). We don't use them every week but I am planning on using them when I have lot going on and cannot cook at home every night. Their plans are very flexible so I can order for a week, hold for a week or cancel anytime. Strongly recommend them!"}
{"text":"Springy delivers delicious, vegan meals to our home each week, each roughly the cost of a quality meal at a restaurant.  Full disclosure - I'm far from a vegan - my wife is vegan(ish) - but we are both vegetarians.  As my wife says, and I admit, I have the palate of a 6 year old - but many of the Sprinly meals have been absolutely delicious - I say many as some are too veganee for me but are 100% loved by my wife.   The meals show up packed in a reusable cooler bag and the Sprinly folks reuse the packaging each week.  Overall - we love the idea and the food and really love the dedication the founders have to sharing delicious, nutritious vegan meals with their customers."}
{"text":"Sprinly is a delightful approach to everyday meals.  I was a part of the pilot period and enjoyed a week of prepared food that was delivered to my home and waiting at my door in an insulated bag.  I especially loved the Citrus Tofu and Blackened Tempeh with Mung Bean Noodles.  The protein was cooked to perfection and the bright notes of citrus perfectly countered the peanut sauce.  It was so fresh!  Ray and Mary make an excellent team and it is evident that they want to put their personal touch on every meal."}
{"text":"I have been very impressed with Sprinly. Their food is unique and very tasty while remaining simple and whole food based. That is not an easy thing to accomplish but they have done so while providing excellent customer service as well. I am recommending it to many of my patients in my Naturopathic medical practice. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Love this service! The meals are delicious and wide ranging and healthy and easy and fresh and just the right size. Excellent service too. Saves me each week when busy I'm working from home and can't cook dinner. Absolute must try!"}
{"text":"I've tried 3 of the 6 meals from week 1 and all were really good! They are larger than most meal service meals and really do fill you up. I appreciate that the menu is changed weekly as I tire of the same old meals week after week. I made my selections for week 2 and am looking forward to trying them as well. The customer service is very personal and friendly!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, well thought out, great packaging, easy to grab and go for busy lifestyles."}
{"text":"Sprinly is absolutely delicious! How can such healthy food taste so amazing!?!?!! I have been searching for a food delivery service for a while now. I am gone 17 hours out of the day, and the food they have delivered to me is nothing short of fantastic! It is FRESH, well sized portions, and so very tasty!! I am a vegetarian, and I am used to bland, boring meals. They have definitely stepped it up. I am happy to support our local companies! The customer support has been truly amazing! Thank you Sprinly!!!!"}
