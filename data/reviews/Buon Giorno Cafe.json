{"text":"I've been to the Buon Giorno Cafe dozens of times and unfortunately they've just hit rock bottom with me. While it used to be a nice cafe serving a variety of Italian and nouvelle dishes done to perfection at reasonable prices by pretty waitresses, it has become a place that slaps food together indifferently with little concern for taste or even whether or not the food has been adequately cooked. I ordered the \"Pasta de la Sandra\" and the sausage pieces were still cold inside... apparently the cook grabbed a handful from the refrigerator and tossed them in, then instantly dumped it on the pasta. The cheese sprinkled on top hadn't even started to melt, there wasn't enough heat in the dish to do so. And of course given that it was slapped together, the flavors didn't blend... This was a pale imitation of the Buon Giorno I first visited several years ago that was reminicent of the food in many a Trastevere (Rome) trattoria. Sorry folks, I'm not coming back unless i hear you're under new management, and I've taken the time to write this only to spare others the unpleasant experience that I had."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant on Smithfield Street in Downtown Pittsburgh. Buon Giorno has a great European cafe feeling to it and I could probably spend a few hours here people watching. All of the staff is very helpful and friendly. I enjoy their Italian wedding soup and they serve it with two generous slices of bread. I'll definitely be back to try more menu items and it looks like they have many daily specials and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"This is definitely a unique little hidden gem near the Smithfield Bridge. The \"cafe\" gave me the impression that it was just a little coffee spot but after going in its like a full restaurant. I stopped in here for the first time for lunch after checking out their menu online. Upon walking in I received a friendly greeting and got a table near the front. The atmosphere was warm and inviting with an Italian vibe. The room has distinct areas for seating that don't feel crammed or thrown together. There is an upstairs seating area with stringed lights, a bar area in the middle for quick lunch eats and a cafe area on the other side of the bar for lunch, coffee or meeting someone. As for food I got the Turkey Pesto Avocado Panini. Very good! Overall nice experience and looking forward to stopping back in and trying more from the menu. I hope that my inside photos bring more people in for the atmosphere as well as for the food!"}
{"text":"Love the portobello mushroom sandwich! They have free delivery and very friendly employees. They also have very fast service... Every time I have ordered, they have been early than expected bringing the food which is also a plus!"}
{"text":"I'm glad I found this place today! The place was pretty busy for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon, which I like to see!

I ordered take-out per my usual MO and had the Italian Eggplant Sandwich. It was good --- marinara sauce, mozzarella,  and red peppers.  The bread was very good (as mentioned in other reviews) and I'll definitely be going back there after my multi-month new-lunch-place-every-day-campaign is over.

It did lack that certain something. Maybe more cheese. Or more sauce. Or more something.  I've been favoring non-meat or non-red-meat dishes lately, so maybe a meat dish would have been more satisfying.

I have zero complaints about the food or service."}
{"text":"I ordered lunch for delivery from Buon Giorno, not expecting too much from it but I was hungry and really wanted a salad and soup. 

I got the italian soup and a greek salad with an iced tea.

The food came fast as lightning. 
They gave me a couple slices of fresh italian bread and butter. The soup was steaming hot when I got it (which is a BONUS). The salad was still cold and crisp, and i put it in my fridge while I devoured the home made italian soup. This soup tasted just like I remember getting from friends grandmas (mine never made it, we're irish). The pasta was still tender and not al mushy like you find a lot of the time. The bread was soft and very fresh. I ate my soup like a greedy little troll and moved on to the salad.
It was a HUGE salad. Such a large portion. I should have known to get a small/side salad. It included fresh home made dressing, kalamata olives, roasted red peppers, fresh feta, cucumbers, onions, twist of lemon, and assortment of lettuce. First of all... that dressing... please bottle it! It's SO good and flavorful. Perfect balance of oil and vinegar and spices. Everything tasted very very fresh in the salad and shamefully I did not finish it and ended up throwing half of it away as it was friday and it would not sit all weekend.

The tea was great! Unsweetened, the way I like it. Served with a lemon slice. 

I will make it my goal to order from here while working downtown at least a few times a month. Can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh for 2 days. And on the first lunch I was invited to a \"Russian\" lunch. I thought awesome! I have not had borsch, kharcho, blini, or piroshki for a long time. 

It was Italian restaurant with gorgeous Russian servers! So that was the Russian lunch. That is one great marketing strategy and it worked. The place was packed with mostly men in business suits. I will guess many of the men were regular customers from the way the devushki were talking with them.  Oh, if you are dressed in suits you are bound to get better treatment from the waitresses. We were not in suits so you know the type of service we received: we had to ask for extras and refills. 

The waitress, Olga \"Olla\" gave us the menu and a paper that said they could not accept credit cards that day. So we all dug into our pockets to check for enough funds for lunch. We had enough. 

Okay, the food. The bread was deliciously yummy. Thick chewy and very high in gluten. One of the best. Dipped into the olive oil and balsamic vinegar...it was bread lover heaven on earth. We had to ask for 3 extra servings.

I had grilled chicken panini and salad.  The food took forever to get to our table of 4. There were definitely more Russian waitresses than cooks there. That long delay was occupied with giant globs of the delicious bread soaked in olive oil and vinegar and capturing in the Russian scenery. Didn't I say this was a great marketing ploy?

When the lunch came, the salad was pale in comparison to the bread. And the panini was weaker yet. How could they get the bread right and the panini wrong?? Maybe the bread was from bakery. We had to hurry up on our lunch to make it back for a conference call. 

Would I go back? Definitely for the bread."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here. I usually come for lunch, whether it be a quick  bite or a more relaxing meal. They also have breakfast if you want a tastier egg, meat and cheese sandwich than your typical Dunkin or McDonalds excuse of a breakfast.  

The food comes out very quick out of respect for your time. It is most popular during the workday lunch rush. I would say that they are most famous for their salads and sandwiches. They are unique Italian/Greek creations with either feta or or red peppers on everything. I particularly love their pasta de la Sandra, which is a penne pasta with mushrooms, sausage & peppers in a balsamic blend. Yumm! The Italian soup and the turkey feta, hummus, pepper sandwich with risotto, are also among my favorites! 

So go to Buon Giorno Cafe on your next lunch break to enjoy great service, a fresh meal, and at a very good price!"}
{"text":"Delicious turkey, spinach, feta, and tomato sandwich. Excellent dressing and quality bread choice. The turkey could be higher quality / more flavorful, but the overall experience was great. Large cookies are almost a second meal! Reasonable prices for the business district. Great lunch option."}
{"text":"This was my favorite lunch-time spot in college. Great, inexpensive options. They have an awesome half-and-half option, where you can do half pasta, half salad for cheap, which was my go-to. The food is super flavorful; I still dream about their marinaded tomatoes. Oh, and their bread! Seating here can be impossible, so mind the time. My favorite was to sit outside.The staff can sometimes lack personality, but the food more then compensated."}
{"text":"This rather non-descript frontage in an office building just on the downtown side of Smithfield St Bridge in Downtown Pittsburgh is a gem. Fast friendly service with outstanding Italian soups, sandwiches, salads, risotto coming from a small kitchen.  All very reasonably priced for the downtown market.  A good stop for a light or business 'working' lunch. 

Location is central to anywhere in the golden triangle, definitely worth the walk - no matter where you're coming from."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast & I was pleased by the customer service & the food. The cookies were great (not sure if baked on site, don't think so) and the breakfast sandwich was good. A little pricey but I plan on stopping again."}
{"text":"Excellent casual business lunches - salads, sandwiches - always freshly prepared and consistent quality.  Family owned."}
{"text":"The first thing you'll notice at this place is the staff. The waitresses are gorgeous... East European or Russian, I would say. I would say though that they are friendly and do a decent job of wait service.

The food itself is good Italian fare. The bread is nice and delicious though sometimes cold. They have pasta dishes that feature ingredients other than having your pasta smothered in red sauce. The Pasta De La Sandra does a good job of melding a number of different flavors together as does the Pasta with spinach, feta and tomatoes.

I've come here a couple times and overall, I'm pretty satisfied and don't mind going back from time to time."}
{"text":"This is a nice little cafe with great food and service. My colleague and I came here for breakfast everyday. Their chai latte is amazing and so are there breakfast bagels and croissants. We also had lunch here one day. The salad was flavorful and wasn't just jam packed with lettuce. There was a good variety of different veggies."}
{"text":"A great hidden gem that I stumbled upon near work. Great lunch specials, decent prices and good food. I went for the Italian wedding soup and 1/2 portobello mushroom sandwich, and that was filling. Super nice staff. Thumbs up from me. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious food, I'm from New England tho so no offense but in my opinion there is no good coffee in Pittsburgh. But there's is decent. Deff My go to café for the steel city"}
{"text":"Average food, the best stuff is on their specials menu, which you can only find in the restaurant. I usually splurge (10 dollars) on a medium sized sweet balsamic salad when it's raining and I can't bear to leave my office building. Other than that, I wouldn't spend the money to dine here. Maybe if the prices dropped it would move to a 4 star rating."}
{"text":"Average food nothing special. Convenient to work. Walk to market square for better options. Service is below average."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service!  A quick and delicious place to eat.  Chicken Buon Giorno- excellent dish!  Comes with a side of risotto, bread and oil.  Chicken was tender, juicy and delicious.  Risotto was perfection.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fast and affordable lunch spot in downtown Pittsburgh. This place is ALWAYS so so consistent. Not once have I had a bad meal here. Their salads are my go-to. Huge menu and everything is made with the freshest ingredients possible. They have really great lunch combos and specials every day. Other than a few occasions where our checks took longer than usual, service is typically very quick. I absolutely adore this place; my favorite lunch spot in Pittsburgh hands down!"}
{"text":"Discovered this wonderful Italian restaurant while I was wondering around town trying to figure out what I would have for lunch today. I walked in and was greeted and seated almost immediately. A few moments later a basket of very fresh, thickly sliced bread was placed at my table. I was surprised at first that there was no butter (although I'm sure I could have gotten some if I would have asked), but then I noticed that there was oil, vinegar and pepper flakes available at the table to make a dipping sauce. 


While I was looking over the menu I was impressed by the selection. There's a wide variety of pasta dishes, sandwiches, salads and specials to choose from. I decided on the Pasta de la Sandra. My order was taken quickly and my dish was served up in about ten minutes; perfect for a working person like me on a lunch break. 

The penne pasta was cooked perfectly with a vinegar and oil based dressing and all of the other ingredients (hot sausage, bell peppers, portabella mushroom, tomato, basil and Romano cheese) bursted with fresh flavor. My check came to a little over $10 which I thought was a bargain for the quality of meal that I had.   

How I've worked in this town for this long and never heard about this place before is beyond me. I will, with out a doubt, come back to Buon Giorno again and again."}
{"text":"Very good food and wait staff and not your usual Italian lunch menu. Lou the owner does a great job with the menu and food quality.  Waitress was very nice, very efficient, friendly and full of energy and smiles -- in Pittsburgh to go to school.  Buon Giorno is a place I meet friends every so often for a good lunch and sometimes a friend brings a bottle of wine since it is BYOB, very nice!  They have fresh baked bread and olive oil and balsamic on the table to start.  Have specials every day and some pasta's and focaccia sandwiches, grilled vegetables and good salads.  Had the Italian Tuna sandwich with comes with artichokes, mozzarella and more.  Sandwich comes with a small salad on the same plate.  Have had the Red Roasted Pepper sandwich and pastas in past visits, all very good.  Deserts are good and made at the restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and tasty. I've had several things from the menu and I quite often order the pasta with grilled chicken. It's s nicely sized portion. Not too much food but also always tends to leave me leftovers for the next day.
The wedding soup is so delicious I highly recommend it.
I don't always have time to eat in but it's very pleasant when I'm able to.
Cute little restaurant just before the Smithfield Street Bridge makes for some fun sights to take in while having an enjoyable lunch."}
{"text":"Buon Giorno is located very close to my workplace, so I often go here for lunch. 

They offer three daily specials (usually a salad, a sandwich, and a pasta) in addition to their full menu. Generally, their food is \"good\", not great.  

I find most of their sandwiches and pastas to be a bit bland, especially those made with ricotta.  Instead of mixing ricotta with a sharper, saltier cheese (as one typically does in lasagna and/or filled pastas), Buon Giorno just sort of dumps it on top of penne and marinara sauce.  How boring. 

I enjoy their italian tuna salad (not the kind with mayo!) and wedding soup. All salads and soups come a few slices of Manini's bread, which never disappoints.  If you order a sandwich, you will receive a side of the risotto (usually either spinach, portabello mushroom, or spinach and feta). The spinach and feta rice is so good, my co-workers call it \"crack rice.\" You always want more. 

Another positive thing about Buon Giorno is their breakfast.  They make delicious breakfast sandwiches and frittatas. 

It is safe to say that all the small plates and sides are excellent at Buon Giorno, while the main entrees are only so-so.  For a cafe that is only open for breakfast and lunch downtown, that's really all you need. But don't go to Buon Giorno expecting a high quality Italian meal."}
