{"text":"We came here for dinner on a weekday with a couple of friends and we were surprised how busy it was, especially since this place is tucked away in a small nondescript plaza. I liked how their menu comes with a separate picture book so you can get an idea of what you might be ordering. Their lunch menu is extensive and reasonably priced but I gather it gets quite busy during lunch. 

I ordered the chicken katsu which included miso, rice, side salad, and dessert. The katsu was divided into 3 portions which was more than filling. The sauce on top was not too overpowering. My husband ordered a sushi combo which included spicy salmon roll, dynamite roll, and california roll. The sushi pieces were larger than expected which made them worth the a la carte price (which was honestly not bad to begin with). 

We will definitely be returning to try more things! Also, a random unnecessary thing to note: The girls washroom has a very fancy sink, the guys do not."}
{"text":"3.5 

Came here with the BF for Valentines Day dinner. We made a reservation for 7pm earlier in the day, and they told us to be on time since it was a busy day. So we got there just before 7pm and when we told them we had a reservation, they said they didn't have our reservation. So after a few mins of back and forth, between the BF and the waitress, and than between the waitress with the owner, turns out there was a mix up and someone had taken our reservation, so we ended up taking theirs, and all was well. Except that exchange had left the BF in a bit of a sour mood. Especially seeing as after we were finally seated, we did not get any menus or tea for almost 10 mins. There was only one waitress serving the whole restaurant, and it was full house because of the occasion. 

We didn't finish lunch until 3pm that day, so we were not too hungry. We debated for quite a while on what to get. The waitress had to come back multiple times before we were ready to order, but she seemed rather nice about it. Even I was starting to think I was annoying. Ha

The Valentines Roll - 9 pcs - California Roll topped with spicy salmon and shredded crunch potatoes along with Haru special sauces ($11.99) interested the BF and since it was Valentines day, we ordered said roll. Haha. The presentation of the roll looked really great. The flavour combination was also really great, but besides the crispy potato strings on top, which tended to fall off the roll before we got to eat it, the roll itself provided no other texture. So the taste was good, but didn't really wow us. 

Spicy Salmon Rolls - 8 pcs ($5.99). We usually love spicy rolls, so we got an order of that to see if they were any good here. They were just average. We like when they mix actually tempera bits into the spicy salmon, to give it some texture. Here they sprinkle the almost powdered like tempura bits on top. The spicy salmon also wasn't spicy enough for our liking. I would put them just a tiny bit higher then the kind of spicy salmon roll you might get at an AYCE.

The Sushi, Sashimi & Roll Set A - Sushi 6 pcs,  Sashimi 10 pcs & California roll 8 pcs ($22.99). The sashimi and sushi were a good size and tasted fresh. There were 5 different types of fish for the sashimi and a nice variety of fish for the sushi. The California rolls were just average. It again provided no texture so was kind of boring. So boring I actually had to fight the BF over who would need to finish the last 2 pcs of it.

Our meal was served with miso soup, salad, and ice cream. The miso soup was average. The salad had a slightly different dressing than usual with a bit of mango taste to it. The ice cream were the usually suspects. They were frozen hard so it was probably already pre-scooped. 

A few mins after all our sushi and rolls arrived, the waitress brought over 4 pcs of fried gyoza on the house as service for the delay of the food coming out. I didn't really notice at the time how long it really took all the food to come out. When I looked back at my pics later, it took them about 10 mins to bring us the miso soup and salad. Our 2 rolls showed up one after the other about 15 mins later. And then it took another 20 mins for our set to come out. 

When we asked for the bill. They brought over 2 small pink treat bags with chocolate in them for us. I noticed they gave those to all the couples who came for dinner. I thought this was a nice little touch on their part for a special occasion. 

The service got better as the night went on as there were less tables to serve. Prices were alright, maybe a tiny bit more expensive than some of the other sushi places in the area, but still reasonable. The place was pretty small and didn't have a lot of tables. But seating was comfortable, and there was enough division between the tables to not feel like we were eating with the people at the next table. I would probably come back to try some more of their special rolls."}
{"text":"This place needs more recognition than it has. 
Friendly and courteous service, clean environment and delicious food. Definitely one of the better sushi places I've been to around this area.

{"text":"Not bad sushi in a tucked away plaza on East Wilmot. This is a decently priced sushi location that offers Japanese and Korean selections. Their rolls are large and their fish is fresh. I am sensing they do not get a lot of traffic as their location is a little strange and they have strange restaurant rules, including not being able to split a bill on Thursday and Friday for lunch, and keeping your kids under control and quiet so that others can enjoy their meal. 

Although certain other website states that you can have 10% off your $25 cash order, that no longer applies according to the server. They did say that it MIGHT apply if you are taking out but they left that fairly ambiguous. 

One funny thing for if you are a late 80/ early 90s baby was that they have old school Britney Spears and spice girls on constant repeat. Haha!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Right when I walked in, a group of 6 were complaining that it has been over 30-45 mins that they did not receive their food. Table next to us when we sat down were discussing the same issue... 

When we sat down we waited quite a while for someone to take our order. Upon ordering.... the lady told us that if we order anything in the sushi menu it would take MORE than an hour... and if you order hot foods etc it will be regular time. 

Unfortunately I did not try the place as I left right away. They prioritized phone orders over walk in. Will never go back. Looked like no one was getting any service, quite sloppy."}
{"text":"The best sushi I have had with amazing service ! Their rich roll is amazing and basically anything on their menu ! This place should have amazing reviews I have never been disappointed and I have tried many Japanese restaurants in the Richmond Hill/Markham area and this one is by far the best!!"}
{"text":"Recommended by family who love the food here. Convenient location to find. Nice and neat environment with excellent service! We ordered sushi and rolls of the lunch combo. The food quality is very good and fresh with lots of choices. Very impressive! I am sure I will visit again!"}
{"text":"First time trying it with my BF, and found out so many amazing rolls. 

We ordered Dancing Roll, Haru Roll, and Love Love Salmon Roll. Personally I LOVE Love love Salmon roll, it is my first time eating roll and it melted in my mouth. It takes longer to do it, because they put it in the oven and cook it slowly. They always serve you with soup and salad if you order over $15 per person.  

Staffs working there are very nice and friendly, great service. 

After lunch, they also treated us free creamy ice cream, which it was very delicious......(yummmm, I'm hungry now~~~~lol)


It is a small and hidden place, but it's a great place to go for sushi if you are sushi lover!~!~!

The reason why I gave 4 stars, it is because last time I ordered Beef Teriyaki Bento and the beef was hard. I didn't even finished it. 

I learned my lesson, go there for sushi.  

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I found this place last week and thought I'd try it for lunch. I was pleasantly surprised. Quality of food is really good. Great flavours, fresh ingredients and correct temperatures. Service was very pleasant. 

The place itself is nicely decorated. Seats were hard and bring pop in a can is more diner-like than a mid priced sushi restaurant. 

I'll definitely return when in the area."}
{"text":"Went with the family for late lunch and we had everything from rolls to bulgogi. Put simply, the service was friendly, the food was served quickly and everything tasted pretty good. Price wise, it was reasonable though I'd stop short of calling it cheap. We all ate off the lunch menu (on a Saturday) which had a wide assortment of Bento boxes, rolls and various Korean food. Portions were of good size, the hot food was hot and everything came with salad and soup. If you're in the mood for sushi or Korean food and in the area, I would say it's worth a trip."}
{"text":"Great place...excellent rolls, friendly polite service, fair prices.

I work down the road, we go there all the time, everyone I know loves it.  

I've had pretty much everything on the menu, hot and cold, except maybe the wraps. I liked everything. 

My favorite is probably the \"teenager roll\".... it's like a flash fried roll....and a nice contrast to  conventional rolls if you want something a little different."}
{"text":"Had lunch and dinner here more than 7 times since they opened just a couple of months ago. Fresh, tasty, and good service. I recommend this place without any hesitation!"}
{"text":"Decor 4 - 15%
Service 4.5 - 15%
Price 3 - 20%
Taste 4 - 50%

Total 3.9 - I round the score up to 4 and here is why:

A Japanese/Korean cosy restaurant that serves typical Japanese sushi and Korean dishes but goes the extra mile with very fresh ingredients.

Haru offers typical sushi/sashimi dishes and Korean Bibimbap.  Specialty rolls are nicely done although ingredients are typical such as prawn, sea urchin, salmon, tuna etc..   Even complimentary salad and miso soup are prepared with care and I could taste the freshness from the food. 

We ordered the tray with 2 specialty rolls, some prawn and vegetable tempura, and once again freshness stood out from every dish we were served.

Not to mention Haru's friendly service.  When we needed their waitresses' attention, they were right there.  It's rare to receive such kind of service nowadays and Haru definitely stands out from their competitors in this regard.

We have already gone back twice.  I am sure there will be the third time."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after reading some of the reviews
Agree with the review - food is excellent service is quick and efficient 

Will be back."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very clean and the service is very friendly service. You get good quality food for a very reasonable price. Packed during weekdays lunch hour."}
{"text":"Dinner is good. For those use to large portions you may be disappointed but the sushi and sashimi tastes fresh and ordering the medium sushi, sashimi and roll the dragon roll that came with it is really good (mix of avocado, eel, soft shell crab). Will definitely come try their lunch special soon!"}
{"text":"Good sushi! Been here for the fist time and liked it. One off thing that ice cream was too frozen. Sushi is very fresh. Definitely  coming back again :)"}
{"text":"Came for dinner, and ordered the Gyoza Soup and Red Dragon roll. I highly recommend the Gyoza Soup--loaded with great veggies and the beef dumplings were delicious. The Red Dragon roll did not fail to delight, either. Overall, great food at a reasonable price, very hospitable servers, and nice ambiance. Came back less than 24 hr later for lunch :)"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout on the way home, it's unfortunate that we don't live too close because we love this place! The portions were very generous and they had given us soup as well (which wasn't included with the massive tray we ordered) 
We ordered sushi, sashimi, roll tray (dynamite & spicy salmon). The fish was fresh and the rolls were huge. Everything was absolutely delish! I'd definitely go back if we're ever in the area :)"}
{"text":"Great food. Pleasant service and fast! Clean and inviting ambiance. They do not rush you out the door to eat and leave. Unsuspectingly good taste and meal. Lunch prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! The service here is great! The lunch and dinner sets are great, and comes with soup, salad, and ICE CREAM!

Food:
- vegetable tempura ($8.99): done well, the noodles are done just right, not too soft/hard
Maki set ($14.99)
- shrimp tempura roll (: good, typical. 
- valentine roll (California Roll topped with spicy salmon and shredded crunch potatoes along with HARU special sauces): very tasty! 

I would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"After reading some of the good reviews about this place, I decided to give it a try and came here for lunch today.  I got there 12'ish and was surprised how empty that place was with only 2 other tables there.  Server was friendly and always had a smile on her face, interior was nice and clean, even the washroom was very clean and well-maintained (being an Asian myself I know how terrible and sick a washroom can be in some Asian restaurants).  I ordered the sundae roll sushi combo from the lunch menu and bf ordered the avocado roll sushi combo.  Service was fast, miso soup was hot, rolls were nicely presented BUT I was very disappointed about my sundae rolls.  The sushi rice was very dry making it feel like the whole roll was made overnight and they just took it out from the fridge to serve it.  I've had rolls from places like Mi-ne and Gal and those were way better.  I may give it another try at Haru but for sure will order something else."}
{"text":"Tried most of their sushi and sashimi dinners:
Fish: Fresh, doesn't taste super fishy or anything
Sushi Rice: Fresh, firm enough and not rock hard
Salad: Fresh. I like it.

I'd eat here over other all you can eat sushi places in the area."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with large pieces, reasonable prices and a great staff. Coming back again tomorrow night!!"}
{"text":"I've been here about four times now and both food and service have been nothing but wonderful. This place is underrated at the moment, there are a lot of empty seats. They are always generous with their servings and they never rushed us out when we came at 9:30 pm one time. I absolutely love this place. So far, no issues with their menu. I love their lion king roll, it's got a bit of everything."}
{"text":"Exceptional service! Food is outstanding! Went there with the family last night for a party of 9. No need to wait for the food after order was placed, we did place a big order but there was no delay! Very attentive service, whatever we asked for and it came pretty much right after, from tea to extra utensils. I wasn't even feeling thirsty throughout the night after dining there, that means no MSG, which is a thumb up for them. I'll definitely go back when I'm around the area as my sister is just minutes away."}
{"text":"This is going to be my new local hangout for affordable Japanese / Korean food.
Ingredients are super fresh. Salad was so fresh and crisp, they take care of the details. They added shiso leaf to the salad and made it that much more interesting. Service and decor are excellent. Staff don't rush you. And they don't run around either. 
We had:
Bimbimbap
Teriyaki beef bento + tempura
Pan fried veggie udon for the kid. 
All were good. No complaints. I will have to try sushi and rolls next time! Rolls look really creative.
I also liked the fact that you could add $3 to any bento and get a full order of shrimp and veggie tempura! 
I was surprised their red bean ice cream was better than the greentea ice cream."}
{"text":"Very generous, very friendly and very fresh.

Food 5/5
Service 5/5
Atmosphere 4.5/5 (a little drafty)

Food was delicious! Nice thick cuts of sashimi and tasty sushi rice to accompany it. Our sushi platters came with 1 or 2 bonus sashimi slices! On top of that, our tray did not include soup, salad or ice-cream BUT THEY SERVED IT TO US ANYWAY FREE OF CHARGE! The tempura batter is different from the regular flakey panko but it was delicious and delivered an awesome crunch!

Although they are a little short staffed for a weekend lunch, they couldn't have been more welcoming. There was a rowdy baby sitting to the table next to us and his parents weren't very nice either however the server was very calm and attended to all their rude demands while keeping a smile on her face.

Our party had the sushi, sashimi and roll tray (30ish pieces? Can't remember), veggie tempura appetizer, sashimi spicy salmon lunch combo and sashimi appetizer. Total came out to $70 including tax.

Reasonable pricing, excellent food and warm service. Extremely pleased. Haru is officially our new go-to sushi place!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, try the Cultus roll.

Very creative, and the combination of flavours is amazing"}
{"text":"We love coming here for their sushi boats/tray. It's not the cheapest sushi in Markham but worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing Sushi!!!!!!!! I am very picky about my sushi. The rolls are big and meaty. Very well presented. Fills you right up and feeling good. I  recommend this place highly"}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars. Came here with a party of 10 on a friend's recommendation for dinner. 
To break it down 
Food - we split a sushi boat with 3 other people and the sushi is pretty much your typical sushi you can get anywhere in Richmond hill. It is however a little bit pricier than most restaurants. The salad they provided is just lettuce with dressing, no tomato or cucumber. Miso soup was pretty standard, same as the ice cream at the end.
Service - we were pretty much the only table in the whole restaurant and I still felt service was slow. At one point our server disappeared with out second tea pot leaving us to share one teapot between 10 people. 
Overall it wasn't bad but if you want the same quality of sushi there are many other venues to choose from that are cheaper 
Also to get free miso soup and salad you have to spend over 15 dollars which to me should be standard and shouldn't have a price attached."}
{"text":"Staff Outstanding ! Food outstanding ! I would go here 7 days a week ! Super Fresh, super yummy and great creative combinations - and i agree with Joong Ho K the Cultrus roll is so good ! And try the Sundae roll ! It sounded to me like I would not enjoy it but so so good !!!"}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed about Haru is that this place is clean - so spic n' span that I thought that it's brand spankin' new. I was then informed that Haru has actually been at this location for about 1 year, which surprised me as I hadn't heard of it (through word of mouth by family) until today. 

And I'm glad we've tried it.  The sashimi here is OK, the $55 medium sashimi boat assortment including some higher end pieces like amaebi/raw sweet shrimp, two small cucumber cups of uni/sea urchin, & a generous spoonful of trimmed clam shell edges.  The real draw to Haru is their rolls: With names like Love Love Love Salmon (salmon baked with salmon roe) and Tiara (sweet potato with melted mozzarella cheese), their rolls menu verge on the creative and unique with tasty results. The menu also offers the \"classics\" like Philadelphia roll, Spider roll, etc. 

Be prepared to shell out ~$12 a pop for about 6-8 pieces per roll. I would personally estimate about 2 rolls plus a side plate (ie: small sashimi) would be enough to be full for two people. 

~~ Roll out! ~~"}
{"text":"French Kiss Roll
It is big. I mean the size of the roll is big compared to other rolls that I normally eat. When I took my first bite, it felt funny. I think I have never tasted a roll that is crunchy. When I took a second roll and examined which ingredient made the roll crunchy, I found out there were apples inside the roll. I don't recall I have ever had apples in a roll. This is new to me. Somehow, I prefer the traditional style.

Shrimp  Tempura 
The presentation is very good. I have never had a seaweed tempura before. Interesting! Nevertheless, the shrimp tempura are hot and crispy. They tasted good.

Although this restaurant uses a Japanese name, it's operated by Korean. Maybe this is one of the reasons that I find the food is not authentic. In general, food is not bad, just that I prefer a particular style."}
{"text":"Our waitress seemed overwhelmed, we tried to order but was told to give her a moment. Prioritized cleaning tables over taking our order. We decided to leave after 20 minutes of waiting. We grabbed McDonald's instead."}
{"text":"I would give Haru a 3.5 rating, overall it was a pleasant experience.

We got 2 lunch sets at $14.99 each, both came with complimentary soup salad and icecream.

The rolls in the lunch set (orange dragon & shrimp tempura) were large and similar to the rolls at Mine Sushi.  Fish was fresh and was standard variety.  Price wise is good value and resraurant is modern inside.

Would come here again when feeling like a regular sushi lunch and don't want to wait a long time or battle for parking."}
{"text":"The freshest of their ingredients can be tasted through every bite and the price tag isn't terrible either. 

They have a selection of combos/platters/rolls that will for sure satisfy whatever you're craving. We ordered two rolls, one being wrapped with a thin rice paper (I can't remember the name) was absolutely delicious and refreshing! We also got a sushi platter, a ramen (nothing out of the ordinary) and unagi don which was delicious. We got a salmon belly roll on the house (I think everyone got one) and it was tasty. 

Overall, very decent place that is not AYCE for sushi. The staff is super friendly and the restaurant is super cute!"}
{"text":"The food is average. We ordered the sushi platter for 5 people. There was about 90 sushi/sashimi/rolls. They gave you the standard fish. Most places when you order a large boat, may come with specialty fish (sweet shrimp, scallops, squid, eel). This one did not have the sweet shrimp, scallops and squid. Their rolls are big as well. We ordered the lobster roll which did not feel like there was lobster in it. I looked closer, it looked like a lobster tempura in the roll. It tasted nothing like Hub sushi lobster roll. The price is average as well, not on the expensive side. Lastly, when we paid, the waitress came to pick up the bill and she asked us if there was anything wrong with the food. We replied no, and then she asked again and she was looking at the amount of tips we were giving. We have given more tips as they have given us free ice cream. It was awkward so we gave another $2, not knowing why she would say that to us. Then she said just 'ok thanks' and left with our money. After 5 mins, she came back and apologized and gave us the $2 back. She said she thought we had a larger bill (there was a party of 10 beside us), so she thought we were that table. Tips is what we think of the service, and we gave more. She may have made a mistake, but you shouldn't give your customers attitude or question them like that. I took away a few stars because of her."}
{"text":"Food is alright. I expect more variety on the sashimi tray instead we get mostly salmon. Their specialty rolls are always good.  Overall, I wouldn't mind to come here just for special roll but probably not their sashimi tray. Also they have good service"}
{"text":"There are few times where I can say, \"Wow, that was really good service\". The waiter was extremely polite and attentive.
We ordered chirashi, tempura udon and dynamite roll.
The chirashi was nothing special, they gave a large portion of rice. However, the sashimi was nothing to write home about.
The tempura udon was REALLY good! the tempura pieces were gigantic and super crispy! And the soup was really tasty.
The dynamite roll was average.

Overall, I'd come back and order the udon and try other rolls."}
{"text":"I have come here about a dozen times for lunch because it offers exceptional value.

The atmosphere alone would keep me coming back, even if the food wasn't a little better than it is at the bigger restaurants and all-you-can-eat places in the area.  I know it sounds like I'm damning by faint praise, but the standard around here is good.  

The rolls come highly recommended, especially the simpler ones, like the avocado and yam rolls.  There is a lunch special which contains both these rolls, and I often eschew the fish in their favour.  The sushi and sashimi is at a good standard - although not remarkable in flavour, they are generiously sized and satisfying.  The selection does tend to be limited to three or four types of fish during lunchtime, however.  The garnish is a lovely, undyed pickled ginger, which is a delight to eat.  

I have been here for dinner and think it is not quite as good value for the price point (would give it three stars), but this restaurant brightens my day lunch after lunch, so I am giving it an overall four stars."}
{"text":"Nice lunch place! I came here with a friend on a Saturday afternoon and it was in a great location right near the entrance of the plaza. We both ordered a bento box which came with miso soup, salad and ice cream afterwards. The bento came with sides of rice, 2 spring rolls and 4 rolls. The serving of chicken katsu was quite large and I was definitely full afterwards. 

There was only 1 waitress for the whole restaurant and as it got busier, service got very slow. We had to wait a while for our bill to pay but other than that, I liked it."}
{"text":"Came here for my friend's birthday dinner, as this place has a pretty high rating on yelp.
I think i came here with too high of an expectation though - overall I find this as just an average Japanese restaurant.

We came here and ordered:
- Unagi Donburi - $18.99
- Chirashi - $17.99

The above orders came with a salad, soup and ice cream as dessert.

The portions are big I must say, and the sashimis are fresh, however it just tastes the same as any other sushi restaurant like Gal Sushi for example. I find the prices on the menu are on the higher side as well.

I wouldn't mind coming back here again, but this is not a restaurant that I would purposely make a trip to as it's similar to many other Markham/Richmond Hill sushi joints."}
{"text":"This place is always busy during lunch time. Their food is great and fresh! 

The people working there are super nice and friendly.

Decor - has the coolest bathroom sinks! Defiantly worth a bathroom visit. The place is clean and great!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The excellent service we received was just icing on the cake. We tried their chirashi and combo A (caterpillar roll and orange roll). Both plates were presented beautifully.  The excellent presentation made the plates more appetizing.  The price tag is reasonable for the quality of their food and the level of service you receive at the restaurant. Sashimi was very fresh and the cuts are very thick. The tempura shrimp in my orange roll was not soggy. The only thing I think they could improve on is their tamago.  However, the overall experience at the restaurant was very pleasant. I would definitely revisit when I have the chance. On a side note, their washrooms are very clean and well managed which many sushi restaurants neglect to do and thus ruining  the entire visit."}
{"text":"I've heard good things about this place so we gave it a try.

I ordered roll set B (Spicy Tuna Roll, Green Dragon Roll (5 PCS), Orange Dragon Roll (5 PCS)) and the Sushi & Roll set B (Sushi (11 PCS), Dynamite Roll (5 PCS)) to share between two of us. The sushi was fresh and decently sized. 

Both combos were executed well and we definitely ordered more than enough food for two people! The combos came with miso soup and also a scoop of ice cream at the end."}
{"text":"Overall - 3.0/5.0

Run by Koreans, this Japanese restaurant has your standard offerings. 

We had the black dragon roll with sashimi and nigiri set. The roll was fairly decent - bbq eel was nicely prepared, the rice to filling ratio was on point and the rice was adequately seasoned with vinegar. The sashimi and nigiri was mediocre in terms of selection and quality.

Service was polite and attentive quick though this was mostly due to the fact that there were only a few other tables occupied at the time."}
{"text":"Haru is a real hidden gem in Richmond Hill. The sushi is fresh, the service is quick and the prices are (actually) unbelievable. I've been there for lunch a few times because I work around the corner. Well... a few times? Let's just say that some of the staff know me now! I've also been there for dinner with friends and they take reservations, even on Friday and Saturday nights."}
{"text":"We r the only one here lols, most people here r ordering take out.

The staff is nice, sushi a little but on the frozen side but overall consider fresh, I love the roll but not the sauce, with eel normally the sauce is sweet, however here they serve the salty sauce which I found funny.

I'll comeback for sure and do the take out as most people do."}
{"text":"We only ordered the medium-sized sashimi/sushi boat item. The sashimi are plentiful and are cut in thick slices (I actually prefer them thin) but my boyfriend loved it. Fresh? Definitely. The sushi is also really good and they are gigantic! The sushi can be inverted and their sashimi will not fall off (a stupid trick that I use to see if they pack it well) so that's a thumbs up for me. In terms of portion size, two people will be full with that boat because I had enough for sure. Accompanied by this sushi boat are salad and miso soup. The salad has a sour sauce which I rarely had in previous Japanese eateries and the miso soup was quite average. 

So what is my verdict? This restaurant is above average in terms of quality and quantity but would do well with a few suggestions:
- Improve marketing (We were the only table at 8:30pm but they deserve props for a great website)
- Give the customers ice cream at the end (Pretty standard nowadays especially when we ordered a boat)"}
{"text":"Wow! What a little find! My friend suggested we go here as she was craving some sushi, and I'm definitely glad we did.

A small little shop, with a warm and welcoming environment made this a lovely place for dinner. The staff were super nice and friendly, and made the meal that much more enjoyable. 

We decided to go for a big boat of sushi, as we were both in that mood, and the staff were very accommodating. I don't eat shellfish, so a lot of the shrimp on the boat would have gone to waste. We asked if we could sub things out, and they were very accommodating. We were able to get other sashimi and sushi to make up for the shrimp, and another roll of the same value for the Dynamite Roll. We went for the Spicy Salmon instead!

All the fish were fresh, and everything was well made. We even got soup and salad each, as they provide that with you meal if you spend above $15 before tax. 

The boat was also very nice, as they pout effort into making it presentable. They had little decorations and ornaments to give the boat an asian feel and appeal to the eyes!

Definitely a win in my books, as we stuffed our bellies with amazing sushi! Will definitely be back another time to try it again!"}
{"text":"A little bit pricey but large quantity and good service. Comes with salad, and ice cream for lunch specials. 

The rolls are large and filling and the hae dup bap is fresh!

Note: no split bills for Thursday or Friday lunches but they take credit!"}
{"text":"Maybe 3.5 stars for me, only because I thought the 4+ rating was overly generous. Don't get me wrong this is not a bad restaurant, but other than their amazing variety of rolls, nothing else really stood out to me. Perhaps we went at a busy time, but our rolls took ridiculously long to come and I was really hungry. I think if they were really a 4+ restaurant they should have brought us some apps (salad etc) when they realized they were backlogged in the roll-making. We did all get a miso soup to begin with, but that doens't really fill your stomach. 

So we ordered the 1) Dancing roll: Mango on top of spicy salmon and shrimp tempura roll. So I thought this was okay, there were thin slices of mango on top, but I really didn't taste the spicy salmon and I thought the flavours didn't go well together. Perhaps they needed some special sauce or crunchy bits. 2) French kiss roll: Shrimp and avocado on top of roll with crunchy powder, crabmeat, mayonnaise, fish eggs, avocado, cucumber, and apple. This was definitely different for me. I really liked the avocado and it went well with the crab meat and mayo. The apple gives it a refreshing kick. 3) Spider roll: Avocado, cucumber, fish eggs, deep-fried crabstick, soft shell crab. This one was not bad, there were some crispy fried bits and fish eggs that tie all the ingredients together. 4) Chicken yakiudon: This was a bit spicy but not bad. Overall, I thought yes, the rolls had generous amount of ingredients and not too much rice. But I thought the rice was too compacted and you can't taste the soft chewy texture. The pieces of rolls were quite big but when I tried to bite into it it would fall apart. I'm not sure if other people have issues with this. I definitely like the variety of rolls they had, but I'm not sure if they had to compromise the quality. The price range was definitely attractive though. 

Lastly, I thought this restaurant was super clean in my standards, including the washroom. The staff were really friendly, they came around to give us tea and also green tea ice-cream in the end. I will definitely come back and maybe try their more interestng rolls to see if I can upgrade their rating."}
{"text":"Tucked away from the busy East Beaver Creek area, it's a small establishment with a quality menu and great service! The menu features a wide range of rice dishes, sushi trays, as well as á la cart options. It is a little on the higher end compared to other sushi establishments of the same caliber, but it is definitley worth it for the freshness of the sashimi, and the portion sizes of sashimi, sushi, and their very creative rolls. Having ordered a sushi, sashimi, and roll tray, I was very impressed by the dynamite roll and spicy salmon roll; both were served in huge portions. The sushi and sashimi was impeccably fresh and in large portions. We also received a nice miso soup and house salad, as well as ice cream! Overall, an excellent choice for a casual sushi experience, with lots to choose from."}
{"text":"Food: 3/5
Service 3/5
I came here with my colleagues on Friday lunch, and we were so disappointed this time, Sashimi were not fresh enough, korean styles (super large size) rolls's sushi rice is very MUSHY and fall apart easily. 

Overall: this sushi place is no longer our lunch spot, also their lunch special prices are a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Went there for dinner over the weekend.
Rolls are yummy.  Ambience is causal.  Service is fine.
Will return for sure."}
{"text":"This place is ran by Koreans so the maki rolls are all Korean-style aka super large size, but I think I actually like them better like this. It's more difficult to eat in one bite but there's an abundance of filling!

The Alaskan Salmon roll was yummy because you could actually taste the freshness of the scallop pieces embedded inside. The sashimi lunch combo #6 was just okay. The dynamite roll was great and I really enjoyed its crunchy aspect, but the sushi and sashimi pieces were just standard. I found a long string of tendon in one piece of sashimi, so it mustn't have been a very good cut. 

My boyfriend also ordered a pork katsu donburi and the flavor was quite good. I really liked that they had some thinly sliced vegetables on top to complement the carb-heavy meal. The pork katsu however, was just average. Nothing special.

The one thing that I really didn't like about this place was the complimentary salad. I was so disappointed that it was so barren. It was just romaine lettuce and dressing when most other places would give at least a cherry tomato or a cucumber slice.. 

The price point here is also set slightly above average."}
{"text":"This is our first time to visit this Japanese restaurant after reviewing yelpers' recommendation.  We went on a Thursday night tonight and the whole dining experience was pleasant and friendly.   The server he is polite and always keep his smile.  The atmosphere is quiet for two of us and it is comfortable vibe with relaxing music.  We tried sea urchin, salmon sushi and love love salmon rolls and tiarra rolls as well. They are fresh and love love salmon rolls are our favourite.   We also ordered a warm sake but it is too hot to pour so I would suggest a napkin or tissue is needed for customers' to pour out from this hot bottle of sake.  
   We love the food and special rolls from a photo album as one of the menu choices.  I am happy we tried it tonight and because of good quality service with good comfy food, we gave extra tips for it.   Love to see smile from the server and polite thank you from the whole tasting experience.   You guys were right, the tea is never emptied!!! Good hospitality !!!!"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre. Do not recommend the spider roll or handrolls. Handrolls seaweed was not crunchy and lots of rice. The haru roll is decent. Appears to be one waitress only for the whole restaurant- slow service"}
{"text":"The rolls were surprisingly so filling and very good! I love purple rice and this is the first sushi restaurant that has served their rolls with purple rice. Will be back next time to try their sashimi bowls!"}
{"text":"OK everyone correct in saying that this place is super clean. My kids could eat off the floor and probably be OK. This is a Korean owned Japanese restaurant. Note, their rolls are large - actually massive. Didn't expect this and ended up ordering too much! 

Anyways, the food is above average and good value. We order a crazy roll, haru roll, need udon, kalbi bento box and a hand roll. Both rolls were excellent. The kalbi was on the fatty side, should have gone for the bulgolgi. Note that the beef in the udon is not bulgolgi. It is just unmarinated slices of beef. Will come back. To try their other rolls"}
{"text":"We got one of the tray to share amongst 2 people. It came with 2 miso soup, salad and ice cream in the end.

The fish was fresh and I enjoyed tuna and salmon. There was white tuna that was lightly torched, which was a good touch. However, I was not a fan of the shrimp tempura roll... it had a lot of tempura pieces in it that gave it a good crunch but it lacked flavour. 

Servers were friendly, and the space could be somewhat tight. Good sushi restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"This is usually my location of choice if I am having sushi withdrawl/am too lazy to venture out. Visited too many times to note but they have all been for the lunch specials. Parking is easy and is easy to find provided you've been to World Bowl (its right across). It is a Korean run spot, and similar to other Korean places I have been too, service is both attentive and friendly. The decor is simple and modern. 

With the lunch specials, I usually pick either the sashimi combos or the bento boxes. Too many specific orders to remember, but I will say this - everything is nice and fresh. Sashimi is sliced well and is cold, and sushi rolls are HUGE. Definitely getting your $$ worth for the portion sizes. Presentation is nice as well, with everything nicely arranged. Not to mention, the lunch specials come with miso soup, salad, and ice cream as well. Bento boxes are nicely arranged as well with rice, spring rolls, your main, as well as a few pieces of sushi. If you're getting a bento for lunch, would 100% recommend adding $3 to get the tempura, as it has 2 pcs of vegetable and 4 pcs of shrimp. 

Been here more than a couple times, but these two are what I would get more often than not: LC3 - Sashimi & Spicy Salmon Roll, LC5 - Sashimi & California Roll. Heard good things about the dinner experience and their sushi boats as well, so will definitely return. However I'm not sure if I can ever turn down the lunch specials!!"}
{"text":"I was looking for decent sushi places around my work & came across here on yelp. 
Decided to check it out. 
To my surprise there was a BOMB lunch specials list & i was very excited. 

I ordered the lunch special Roll 8, which included 4 spicy salmon , & 10 dynamite. It also came with miso soup and a green salad & ice cream. 
This all for 10.99 
AMAZING. 
Very happy with the potions for the price. Its really fantastic 
The sushi however wasnt amazing. Everything was OKAY quality . The miso soup tasted like tap water with metal in it. & she walks by and removes my salad without asking if im done with it. 

Very mediocre place. Worth the price though :)"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I thought that the Spicy Caterpillar Roll was less than spectacular in taste.  The rice that wrapped around the spicy tuna and cucumber was very mushy and not characteristic of Japanese rice at all which should be firm.  I was quite disappointed with the quality of the rice here.  I couldn't really taste the tuna inside the roll either...  The wasabi also wasn't spicy enough for my taste."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for dinner on a weeknight. 

Service: 2/5
Food:3/5
Ambience: 4/5

My friend ordered a sashimi dinner that comes with soup, salad, and dessert. And I ordered a roll that doesn't come with anything. ( but I knew that and I was perfectly ok with it) 

When the waitress/owner came out with soup and salad for my friend, she also gave me one but said \" yours doesn't come with soup but I give you,ok?\"

I find that comment a bit rude. First of all, I KNOW it doesn't come with soup, secondly, I didn't even care for the soup. If they want to be nice, then just give me the soup without saying anything. 

My friend had to ask her for the dessert because she was going to not give her the dessert because MY meal doesn't come with it! 

I don't like it when restaurant make a big deal about little stuff like this, try to be nice but not genuinely nice, and only want you to feel like you owe them a favor or a bigger tip. 

The food itself is ordinary. Definitely not good enough for me to come back to this kind of service."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my wife for lunch since the reviews looked decent. Very nice interior space, not what I would expect for the area. Service was friendly, prompt and attentive. Great value with their numerous lunch specials. Ultra clean & not kid friendly however. One of the better sushi places I've been to in Markham."}
{"text":"Cute little Japanese restaurant with good service. 
The specialty rolls were pretty big, and they offered an amuse bouche, miso soup and ice cream on the house!"}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday for late lunch with my boyfriend. The decor is very cute! However there are signs about rules for children which I found odd.

We ordered a lunch special which had 4 spicy salmon and 8 dynamite pieces; the spicy salmon is mashed up and not actual salmon pieces, the dynamite roll had a citrus like sauce on top which ruined the roll...because it tasted very weird. I would not recommend this special. Also ordered the Titan roll and Sunshine roll, which were quite large. They were both decent but not good enough to make me want to come back.  

All lunch specials come with a salad, miso soup, and ice cream. Even though we only ordered one lunch special, both of us got them which was nice."}
{"text":"Great for lunch with lots of combos/specials that are decently priced. If you opt-out from their lunch menu, soup, salad and icecream is served only if you order $15 worth of food per person before taxes. To be honest, you won't miss out on much if you don't get it. Miso soup was decent but I personally did not like the salad. Something off about the dressing that just didn't work for me. Ice cream was extremely hard and it took us so long to cut through it for every bite that we gave up halfway.
 
Sushi however, is quite good and nicely presented. My boyfriend ordered LC6 from the lunch menu containing 6 sashimi pieces, 5 nigiri pieces and 5 pieces of their Dynamite roll. Albeit the sashimi cut could've been a tad thicker, it was really fresh. 

I would highly recommend coming here for the rolls because there's a pretty big selection (a lot of interesting combinations) and the ones under the specials are huge in size! Better value for sure. I loved the Rich Roll!! The shrimp tempura was so crispy and the roll just had a ton of flavour! All the components worked really well together - the avocado, cucumber, fish egg, shredded crab, spicy salmon. Yum.

Spicy Salmon Roll is rather heavy as they use shredded potatoes instead of tempura bits. It was an interesting twist but the potatoes take away from the taste of the salmon sashimi. Overall, the roll just doesn't have the soft yet crunchy texture that is usually found in your typical spicy salmon roll. I have mixed feelings about this one.

Wasn't a big fan of the sauce used on the Dynamite Roll which is on the sweeter side. Would've preferred it plain or just your good ol' spicy mayo.

Service was lovely. I believe our server was in fact the owner and she was super attentive and friendly.

This place is kind of in the middle of nowhere. The only thing recognizable around was World Bowl which was across the street. Outside also looks sketchy but the interior is new, clean and nicely designed.

Haru has its hits and misses. Not bad but not memorable."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of the sushi in the west coast. The service was great, the waitress was always attentive. We came here for lunch so we ordered one sushi combo (shrimp tempura roll + spider roll) and we ordered the sunshine roll as well. The fish is so fresh and the sauces they use goes perfectly with the rolls! I would definitely come back again to try more! The prices for the lunch combos are great too (ESP if you want to try a variety of stuff)"}
{"text":"This place is a gem! It is now my favorite sushi within Markham hwy7 sea.. Excellent sushi and  rolls, they have some unique dishes too, service is very friendly and unobtrusive.. Very cozy ambience, super clean...it wins five stars on this combination of traits that eludes most other places."}
{"text":"Great service. Delicious. Fresh. Cosy. A bit pricey but you get what you pay for. Definitely try this place."}
{"text":"I went with my son first time to try it it. The sashimi is very average. That means everything else is the same. The service was good and the place wasn't very simply."}
{"text":"Super cheap lunch menu.  They have a bunch of cheap rolls including an orange dragon roll which was included in a combo that also has salmon sushi.  The good thing about this place is that they have so much variety and all for a really cheap price. 

However the roll wasn't as good as I thought it'd be.  It is quite large in size but it isn't as good as Mi-ne.  Very similar to sushi bong."}
{"text":"Haru sushi is located in a dense office populated area in Richmond Hill. After seeing the ratings on Yelp, we came in for a try. Coming here for lunch on a weekday, I realized that Haru is packed - this is also why they don't split bills on Thursday and Friday. 

Since they were so packed and only had two waitresses on deck + one waiter that served drinks and entrees, service was rather slow. Although we were seated right away, it was difficult to get the attention of the staff to order food, in addition, it took a while before we had tea. 

They had a lot of lunch specials to choose from, many of which were around $10 or slightly more than $10 - they included a salad, miso soup and ice cream. (LC3 - $12.99, which was the 8 pieces of sashimi and 8 pieces of spicy salmon roll), next we got the (LC21 - $10.99 which was 10 pieces of dynamite roll and 8 pieces of California roll). These were actually rather large portions - especially with the rolls. The quality of the sushi was decent, but I think the rolls could have been a little more tasty and less rushed during preparation (though I know it's difficult due to rush hour timing)"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients. Newly Renovated. Cozy  Ambience. Great Customer Service. 
Tried their Haru Roll - pretty unique and delicious. 
Worth a try if you're around the richmond hill neighborhood. 
I'll definitely come back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"Another one of our regular places. Rolls are huge and creative. The restaurant itself is small but we usually come on a weeknight and we've rarely had to wait long. 

Kids love the udon, kalbi, and free ice cream, and adults love how full and satisfied we are. We've tried many of the rolls and while some are exceptional, there havent been any that were really disappointing."}
{"text":"Just stopped by for lunch during a weekday. It was half full, and service was attentive and friendly - some of the best service I'd had in a while. The lunch specials are a good deal thanks to the favorable US-CAN exchange rate. 

I love salmon sashimi in particular, but was a little disappointed that the sashimi wasn't as flavorful as I have experienced in the past at other restaurants (though I will admit, I don't know if that's because it should taste stronger or not). The salad that came with the special was on the meager side (other places have shredded carrot with the greens; but this place was relatively modest. Other than that the food was very good. Very clean, tiny, and I would absolutely go again."}
{"text":"I really hate writing bad reviews, especially when I get 5 star service with a smile...

But - the food is just terrible. I was literally lured there by a colleague who claimed the quality of fish is excellent - not sure compared to what exactly...

Worst spicy salmon rolls I ever had - just thinking about them makes me cringe. 

Never again"}
{"text":"Great service !!!! Prices are good !! Portion is very generous. Clean bright place. Loved it ! Will go back anytime. Highly recommend !!"}
{"text":"Just walked in at 9:15pm on Sunday (supposed to close at 10pm) and they refused to sit us. There was only one other party of 3, so I think they just wanted to close shop early. 

Really disappointed they wouldn't serve us. It's not like we were a group of rowdy teenagers looking to get turnt! Just a family of 5 that probably would've finished eating by 10pm anyways."}
{"text":"I'm super impressed with Haru and I'm glad I found this spot on yelp. Maybe I was incredibly hungry, I don't know but I shall give it 5 sparkling stars for a faultless and delicious lunch.

The restaurant is located off highway 7 and Leslie and could be difficult to find. Came with my family for a weekday lunch and it was packed with people who came from work. The restaurant is modern and clean.

We ordered the tempura appetizer to start, which was $10 for 6. It was super crispy yet light at the same time and fairly large as well. They gave us an extra soup and salad which was welcome and is good customer service. I don't understand why more places don't do this, as it goes a long way and does make a good lasting impression. It doesn't cost that much anyways. We went with the sushi boat TR02 which came with 25 sushi and 25 rolls. The boat came out incredibly fast, which kind of makes you skeptical, but everything was done well. The sushi was a fairly standard selection but I was blown away by their butterfish and unagi sushi. Their unagi was extra grilled and had extra sauce on it; it looks kinda wicked and tasted as good as it looked. I don't think I have eaten a butterfish like that before either. It was so good! All their sushi was on the warm side which I really like. Makes it more 'melt-in-your-mouth' if you will. The rolls were very good too. The boat came with caterpillar, orange dragon, spicy salmon, and California rolls. I was impressed enough that I will order special rolls separately next time. There's a good amount of sauce and the rolls are not skimpy (as there's a good amount of ingredients in there). Just good rolls overall. 

Service ended with complimentary ice cream which again, is awesome. Overall, I'll definitely be back to Haru for some fantastic sushi."}
{"text":"Great service. Reasonably priced. Food is so-so, nothing to write home about but no major complaints either. Wish their complimentary salads weren't so limpy though (literally only 3 pieces of lettuce only)."}
{"text":"I think i found a hidden gem!!  On a Friday during lunch, I picked up a friend nearby and we were both craving for some good sushi but wanted to try somewhere new, so I went on yelp to do a search and found this place.  After reading Jenn K's review, I was sold!

Glad i made the choice to come here, they have a wide selection of set lunches and they all range from $10 - $15 plus tax.  I went with one of the sushi combos that came with 7 nigiri sushi and 8 spicy salmon roll.  Decent portion for a sushi set lunch!  The set lunch also came with a salad with amazing dressing and a dessert which I went with the Green Tea ice cream.  We also ordered a Haru sushi to share, it's a 8 pieces roll with baked scallops in spicy creamy sauce on top of California Roll.  Delicious roll with good portion again, but make sure you give them 10-15 minutes to prepare.

Overall experience was amazing!  Great decorations with great food AND great customer service.  What a great addition to the Markham/Richmond Hill area!"}
{"text":"Got take out, not bad. As you can see on the image, one of the rolls - too much cucumber. But other rolls were good, as well as sushi, no complaints here"}
{"text":"I wish I found this hidden gem earlier, given that it's 5 minutes away from home. That said, there are quite a few sushi restaurants around the Leslie and Highway 7 area. 

Highlights:  
- Affordable lunch specials ($12-15 range)
- Generous portions. Good sized pieces of sashimi 
- Wide variety of bento box or sushi / sashimi / roll combos
- Good and speedy service
- Clean restaurant and clean washrooms

We ordered a pork katsu bento box which came with 2 veggie spring rolls, 2 yam tempura roll pieces and 2 California roll pieces. The kids loved it. 

My wife ordered the California and Titan roll combo. 

I ordered the sushi, sashimi and dynamite roll combo. 

Overall very delicious and this will be my new go-to spot for sushi lunches during the week and on weekends."}
{"text":"Stick to their rolls. The Rich Roll and Spicy Salmon roll were quite standard but had good portion size and rice-to-filling ratio. The sashimi, on the other hand, were of low quality aside from the average salmon. Some were also tendinous, making it hard to chew. 

Service was good though. And they gave extra miso soup & ice-cream even though the roll wasn't from lunch menu."}
{"text":"Came here on Friday night with Jen and a close friend.  Away from the busy area of East Beaver Creek, Haru is an awesome sushi place we all discovered.  Across from World Bowl, parking near this venue can be difficult to find during peak dinner and weekend hours.  
The place is clean, airy, with plenty for seating.  The service was superb! actually I found it quite personable, efficient and most of all friendly. 
I would recommend trying their various rolls along with some of the ones listed below in this review.  Just beware, lol their rolls are huge! For a party of 3, we order 4 rolls and we 'just' barely finished them off. 
The only downside to ordering the rolls is that they don't serve miso soup, however the owner was kind enough to serve us a small order of house rolls they've recently created... pretty cool. 
however below is the breakdown of various rolls we ordered.  ALL in fact were a great choice.  Will I return? Of course! 
Valentine's Roll
Rich roll
Sunshine roll
White sushi roll"}
{"text":"Read the reviews about Haru Sushi and decided to check it out today for lunch. We ordered  the Sunshine Rainbow, Sundae Roll, and Beef Udon. The rolls were very good and portions were generous. We were impressed. Service was great. However, the beef in the udon wasn't that good. The green salad was quite bitter as well. I'd recommend coming here only for the rolls."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend the other day and I have to say it's quite good. Share a sushi combo and get some specialty rolls; You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi place in markham that I've been to thus far. (And I do eat a lot of sushi)

The special rolls are so tasty and melt in your mouth. Move over Osaka you got nothing on them! 

Prices are fairly decent and not overpriced. Quality of the fish is good. 

The menu has a bit of everything. Sushi Boats, udon, takoyaki, sushi pizza and more. 

Located right across markham bowl. If you ever get hungry after bowling definately cross over and grab a bite. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"After seeing the raves reviews on Instagram & Yelp, after a ball game, a group of 8 of us decided to check it out. Haru is located in a very small plaza across from World Bowl on Leslie, next to the a popular Hot Pot joint. Haru was a lot smaller than we imagined, and on a Sunday night at 7:00pm there was no one in the restaurant. At first out waitress was a bit rude, but later on became alot nicer through out our meal. Our group decided to order two 80 piece of the sushi & sashimi boat. There was a good variety of assortments in our order, the sashimi and rolls were fresh. Haru seems like just like many of the other sushi joints. There was nothing that particularly stood out."}
{"text":"Grabbed a lunch take out there just by chance on a weekend. It was the only place still open for lunch by that time and technically it was after lunch but they gave it to us anyway. 

We were only grabbing to go, but the staff there were so sweet and kept asking if we want tea while we waited to stay hydrated. 

The sushi was not bad. Pretty good spot at a reasonable price. The set sushi lunches are great portions for an average eater. Fish was cool and firm and the rice was a good texture. The rolls weren't falling apart which is a big plus :)

It's a nice quiet spot to visit if you're in the area :)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with my girlfriend. It's a small place but luckily we were seated as another table left. The servers were a little preoccupied and slow to take our order but were apologetic.

I always like to try signature rolls so we ordered a larger dinner set and the Haru Roll. Two soups and salads were still provided. The main dishes were a little slow to arrive so they gave some free spring rolls.

The Haru Roll was quite rich and a little spicy. Not sure how well the scallop comes through, but the roll tasted okay. The nigiri sushi was pretty good, the fish seems pretty fresh and the rice was still a little warm. The black dragon roll was as expected. The interesting thing is the soy sauce they provided tastes a bit sweet, it gave all the sushi an interesting taste. Overall food seemed acceptable for the price. There's also ice cream!"}
{"text":"A favorite sushi spot of family members, and I was recently introduced to this quiet little spot. Came on a Saturday late afternoon for lunch and there was several busy tables still. I've heard that there are line ups at peak hours, so expect a wait during meal hours.

Their price points are reasonable as their portions and quality is good. We ordered a lunch special and a roll, and it was enough for two light meals (which was exactly what we were looking for). The stand out of the meal was the roll. It was larger than most, the rice is soft and there was plenty of 'stuffing'. Great service as well!"}
{"text":"A pretty good Japanese Korean place. They offer a variety of rolls, sushi, and sashimi. There are lunch and dinner sets available. Food was good. The staff were friendly. I would go again. I also appreciate how they have a little photo album that shows pictures of each of the rolls."}
{"text":"From a price point perspective, Haru is not cheap.  We ordered one unagi rice ($18), one chirashi ($17), one salmon teriyaki bento ($18) and one French Kiss roll ($13).  No beverage.  The bill was $70 before tip. 

For a food perspective, I totally agree with Joyce K and Cindy L that the rolls are the better choices.  The French Kiss roll was rolled tight.  The apple in the middle gave a good kick in taste and a contrast in texture.  The portion was good.

For the other three entrees, the portion of the protein, as in salmon, eel and sashimi, was average.  I had the chirashi.  The sashimi was fresh but it was not at all creamy or cut thick as another reviewer said.  The rice portion was very generous, and the rice tasted good enough.  I just hoped that they used better grain.  At this price point, they should be able to afford it.

If you come here, my advice is same as Joyce K's.  Stick with the rolls.  You will have a better dining experience and get better value."}
{"text":"This Japanese restaurant had been around for a few years. The food is good and always great service. The rolls, sushi, and sashimi are pretty good for their price point. They also have a good selection of Korean dishes since they seem to be Korean owned. Definitely their must orders are their rolls! Lots to choose from!"}
{"text":"We came here on a weekday when it wasn't too busy. We ordered the Spicy Pork Bulgogi, Donkatsu, and Titan roll. Initially, we were served with the usual miso soup and salad. Following that, the spicy pork bulgogi came out bubbling hot and it was absolutely delicious. It was a bit too oily once you reach the bottom, but nonetheless a great dish. The Donkatsu was very filling and super crispy. I personally enjoy crispy pork cutlet. The titan roll included shrimp tempura, japanese crabstick, topped with spicy tuna. If it weren't for the spicy tuna, the roll would have been lacking flavor and presentation. We were already quite full at this point and they gave us ice cream to finish off! YUM! 

Overall: 
- Great sushi
- Amazing attentive staff
- Well priced
- Good portions"}
{"text":"$79.99 for their 84 piece sashimi/sushi boat.

Meal came with salad, miso soup and green tea ice cream for dessert.

Presentation was great. The boat was massive in size. The sushi rolls were huge. The fish was fresh and tasted good. Nothing really stood out for me though. The other sushi boats I have had before usually have higher end items like uni, scallop or shrimp but this one didn't have any of those. Just your typical sashimi and rolls. 

Service was excellent as there was only one other table being served. Surprised at how dead it was on a Saturday but I guess they get more business on weekdays from all the office workers in the area."}
{"text":"+.5 for service

Well, 4.5/5 certainly doesn't do this place justice. It's not a bad restaurant, but compared to other sushi restaurants I've been to in Richmond Hill/Markham this place is around the front-middle of the pack.

We came here on a Saturday night at around 9pm when it was completely deserted. Did we came too late? Was the place maybe overhyped a bit (a lot)? We decided to stick it out at the end since I couldn't resist seeing the 4.5/5 stars Yelp currently gives for this place.

My family ordered the Haru roll, sundae roll, yoga wrap, spicy chicken, and sashimi combo medium. The sushi bar in general was acceptable, however the tuna in the sashimi felt low quality, and I can barely taste the tuna in the sashimi. The haru roll was miles better than the sundae roll, which felt nothing too special (although the cream cheese was a good add). The yoga wraps were huge, and was definitely a good choice in terms of healthiness. The white sesame sauce tasted a little off though. Finally the spicy chicken was great according to my parents; I couldn't take spice well so I skipped on that meal.

Miso soup and salad were decent, nothing too out of the ordinary.

I somewhat expected dessert or oranges from this place as is standard with many Japanese restaurants in the area, but we never got any. Oh well.

Service overall was great though, in fact I think the servers overdid it in terms of hospitality. It was a little too good, felt like he was part of our family.

Will I come back? I wouldn't totally rush to return, but if I am nearby this place would definitely be in my considerations list."}
{"text":"Service is excellent! It's a very cozy place with a quiet atmosphere. They serve you an appetizer sushi roll on the house. If you order the specialty rolls... just know that they are HUGE and you'll probably only end up finishing only one roll yourself even if you have a big appetite. Usually about 8-10 pieces and this size of the roll is almost about the size of their teacups. So just us that as comparison. 

We ordered two miso soups, two salads, and 3 specialty rolls and let just say that we packed 1 1/3 of the rolls home. Although we don't get free ice cream because we did a la carte style, they were extremely nice and gave us free ice cream anyways because we ordered so much for two people. The bill came out to around $65-$69 excluding tips. 

Must have!!!
The rich roll (specialty roll) 
It has flying fish roe, crab meat, cucumber, shrimp tempura, avocado on the inside and topped with spicy salmon on top with crisps. It's amazing.... 

Definitely check out their trays (comes on boats) if you're there with 3+ people. It's definitely worth it. It comes with appetizers to sashimi, to rolls and to dessert as well. Prices are fairly good for the amount of food you're getting."}
{"text":"Quality: 3.5/5
Service: 4/5
Price: 3/5

Ordered spicy sunshine rainbow roll, I liked it better than regular rainbow roll. Also ordered a combo with sushi + nigri platter, that was kind of disappointing. The service here was very good, often coming by to fill up water or ask if you need anything. I would say the food is subpar for what they charge. It's not good but not bad either."}
{"text":"Haru is clean, family friendly, and serves up some very good food.  Their lunch menu includes an ice cream dessert.  Everything we ordered came in good time.  The place was pretty busy for a Saturday lunch."}
{"text":"This place is probably one of the best sushi I ever had in my life a little bit on the pricey side but I didn't realize how ginormous the rolls are. My favorite roll was the spicy salmon roll blowtorched. The susbi tasted like butter it melts in your mouth. The ambiance inside is really nice and out of all the susbi places I had including wow sushi this beats it out of the park. The caterpillar rill is really tasty as well fresh avocado. In order for sushi to be good you have to get the best fish and best quality ingredients and this is exactly what haru displays and they gave us free ice cream which I really appreciated."}
{"text":"What I really liked about Haru was how amazingly clean this restaurant is. You can tell the owners here really care about cleanliness. Also, the decor is also updated, making the environment more refreshing and comfortable. The service here is also really superb. The waiter was attentive and was also patient with us. I was surprised that the restaurant was really empty around 6 pm on a Friday night but more people came into the restaurant as the night went on so I guess it was a good sign. 

What's also interesting is that they have two menus. One menu is a photo album of their rolls and the other menu with all their other foods. We ordered: titan roll, chicken teriyaki combo (came with salad, soup, ice cream, and rolls) and sushi & roll set B. Honestly, the prices are pretty reasonable and they have a lot of combos which aren't too expensive. I would rather come here to eat affordable a la carte sushi.  A lot of a la carte sushi restaurants in Richmond Hill lack combos so this is a place to eat if you want to eat a combo dinner. Everything about the food was good except the titan roll. I wasn't a big fan of the crabstick and tempura and the roll broke apart easily because it was so big. If I were to come here again, I would get another roll. 

Though the service was good, when the restaurant got busy, we had to flag down the waiter to give us our bill. It was funny how the owners and the waiters did not rush us at all, which I liked about that."}
{"text":"Cheap lunch specials, long waits and only 1 server for the entire place, you get what you paid for mediocre sushi with sashimi that is cut into really thick pieces, I honestly didn't think the quality was good at all, the wait for the food took a long time, so many better places to go to for sushi in the area, I'd skip this place"}
{"text":"Ordered the bulgogi dinner (delicious!) and my husband ordered the chirashi (really fresh!).  Kani (crab salad) was tasty and we also ordered the sundae roll (very tasty!). Just like other reviews, staff is very friendly, great service and very clean!  We would definitely come back her to try the lunch specials! 
Came back a second time and wasn't disappointed!  Husband and friend ordered a boat and they loved it!  Fresh sashimi for a good price! I ordered the pork katsu and it was humongous! This is our new favourite place to eat!"}
{"text":"2** For food, +1* for service.

Maybe I ordered the wrong thing on the menu but my lunch wasn't as good as I had hoped. I had the tempura bento and it was heavy. The batter on the tempura is way too heavy so it reminded me of the same batter you would get with fish and chips?! It's crispy but it didn't feel like a tempura to me. There's nothing in the box to get a break from all the oily food. The tempura is obviously deep fried, the dumplings were covered up with corn starch or flour then deep fried, even the yam rolls had deep fried yams in them. Maybe if they added something lighter like cold soy tofu or more salad this box would've worked. The service was attentive and my cup of tea was never empty."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with the family. Service is great, food is awesome and the price is reasonable. Had a few sashimi that weren't available at the time we were there, though. Even though we only ordered one with salad/soup/dessert, we were given the choice of soup/salad for each person since we've ordered plenty of rolls/sashimi. Everyone even got an ice cream ... like I said, service is great :)"}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place. It is my go-to place when I crave for rolls. Their sashimi isn't too bad either for the price (although you can definitely find better sashimi restaurants in markham). 
I have been here at least 10 times, highly recommend the Rich Roll, Rainbow Roll, Lobster Roll and Sashimi Combi 1 (i think it is a lunch special?)
Service is great, the ladies there are very welcoming and polite. 
No split bills for Thursday and Friday"}
{"text":"Extremely fresh! 2 of us shared a small sashimi tray (40 pcs), a haru roll,  and 3 pcs of sea urchin (uni) sashimi. Their sashimi is cut fairly thick which is served at a perfect temperature. 

The sea urchin was really fresh too. The freshest I've had. My other favourite was the white tuna sashimi. It was seared around the edge and had a lovely smoky taste while the tuna melted in my mouth. 

However, what makes this place really above and beyond is their impeccable service and fantastic attention to detail. They handed out chocolates for Valentine's day,  always had a smile, and would even adjust the green tea ice cream bowl closer to me for ease of access. My tea cup was also always filled.

I would definitely suggest this if you would like good quality food and a nice atmosphere to have pleasant conversations because it isn't too loud... Peaceful almost"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and FRESH! Service was also excellent, the waitress really took care of us. 

We decided on one of the roll trays (40 PCS) which included the California Roll, Salmon Roll, Shrimp Tempura Roll, Black Dragon Roll, Orange Dragon Roll and the Spicy Caterpillar Roll (which was definitely our favourite and a must try!)

If you are in the area, you should definitely check this place out. The food looks incredibly appetizing and will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"This is a cozy Japanese/Korean restaurant. They serve mostly sushi but I came here for the bibimbap. To start off, the staff was very friendly and service was quick. The bibimbap special was an excellent value as it came with salad, miso soup and your choice of ice cream. The bibimbap itself was excellent and beautifully presented. It had a good balance of rice, veggies and bulgogi beef, although if you're a serious meat eater I recommend getting a strictly bulgogi dish as bibimbap is a veggie dish with some meat served on the side. 
To me, decor doesn't make a big difference to my dining experience, however the interior was beautifully done in a simplistic modern Japanese look and really did add value to my meal. 
I can definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends and will visit again in the future."}
{"text":"Authentic Japanese restaurant with nice atmosphere, delicious food at decent prices = scorrrrrre! 

I've been to neighbouring Japanese restos and I either find them to be cheap but non authentic or authentic but too expensive. Haru is authentic and fairly inexpensive!  I love rolls and they have a variety of unique rolls that's far from being traditional.  I ordered the Rich roll and it was delicious!! Great flavour with the perfect amount of crunch and spiciness. Their rolls are fairly big and it's not because it's loaded with rice like others but rather filled with lots of ingredients like cucumber and crab. Hmmmmmm. 

Haru has just became my top 3 Japanese resto in the Richmond hill area."}
{"text":"Great Jap/Korean restaurant in a small plaza off of Leslie in Markham/Richmond Hill area.  Prices are a little above average but the quality seems to be up there too.  BiBimBap is very tasty as is the Haru roll.  The Chirashi plate has good variety and good quality sashimi.  

Been there many times already and can't find any faults other then they might be very busy at times and you have to wait, even for pickup/take out."}
{"text":"Haru was awesome! Got take out on a Thursday night. While we waited, we were served tea which was really nice. 

They were very accommodating to requests to torch sushi or remove ingredients from rolls. 

Got dynamite roll, spicy salmon, torched salmon sushi, and red devil roll. All were really fresh and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place based on all the other yelp reviews. Glad I did! Definitely a hidden gem. 

The waiter was really polite and nice. It was just the two of us. We were about to order a small boat and he kindly suggested us to order a dinner set that was similar but provided soup ice cream and salad.  So a bit more value for the same $. So we ended up having the sushi sashimi and roll set b and the cultra (?) Roll. 
Awesome. Fresh. 
The sashimi had the perfect temp and you could see how well it was cut. Call me crazy but i could even taste the sweetness of the seaweed in the cali roll!!! And the cultra roll was unique and refreshing.  Presentation for everything was neat and clean.
 Will come again. Hope this place sticks around!"}
{"text":"Amazing Japanese Restaurant! Rare find close to home . Everything was fresh and tasteful! The service was impeccable! One of our dishes came with soup, salad and ice cream . There were two of us so they gave both of us soup , salad and ice cream ! Such thoughtfulness!"}
{"text":"Haru sushi is a slightly fancier a-la-carte sushi restaurant with a good selection of novel sushi rolls. Price ranges from about $13-$15 for 8-10 special sushi roll pieces. I got the Haru sushi which is just plain maki roll (cucumber, avocado, imitation crab, and fish roe) topped with a mildly spicy, creamy cheesy sauce with very small baked scallops. The scallop pieces are VERY small (I suspect it may be one big scallop cut up into tiny pieces) so the selling point is really the topping sauce. It IS very delicious though if you're into creamy cheesy foods. It is only 8 pieces (most special rolls are 10) but due to the heavy sauce, I still found it very filling. 

My boyfriend ordered the chicken donburi. He thought it was a small portion but he is a big eater so it's subjective. It's very soupy, which is different from how most other places make it, so if that's your thing, give it a try. I tried some of his meal and it's not bad. I like that it wasn't overly salty but still flavourful.

Overall, it was a good experience and their waiting staff were very nice :)"}
{"text":"This sushi sits in a light industrial area. It's not ayce so the sushi quality is there. I normally go there for lunch. Beware of their line ups. Sometimes, they over work the kitchen causing delay in food served. Most of the time it's ok. The lunch menu is pretty good, got sushi and roll. The portions are generous so you will get a filling meal. (Keep in mind I'm 5'6\" and 190lbs) I also had the sushi boat and the sushimi are pretty fresh overall. 

I this would be my standard dinner place. If it would improve on the wait time and create something special, it would get the last star."}
{"text":"Haru is getting 4.5 stars for being an excellent middle of the road priced non-AYCE sushi restaurant. 

We got here late Friday night expecting a crowded restaurant, but it turned out to be a nice and quiet room with no wait; the tables were not crowded closely together, and they didn't blast any music super loud that I hate about all restaurants these days because I end up shouting conversation with my diners.

The California rolls we had were super fresh, and they make very flavourful sushi rice.

Service was attentive and polite, and wait staff actually smiled and didn't act like they were too good for their job (which is a common characteristic of many Asian restaurants in busy Markham/Richmond Hill).

The table that sat next to us had food sensitivity questions, and the staff took the time to check with the kitchen to ensure their orders would be safe to eat before taking down the items.

*As for comments in previous posts about Haru having a poster telling people to keep their children under control, though a poster may have been overly-explicit I think it's still an interesting effort and experiment in telling people \"Hey, if you can't stand the noise your kids make at home so out of habit you let them out like caged animals to go nuts in public spaces, please be considerate of other people who are also paying customers that want a nice dining experience because our restaurant is not a daycare and we would overstep to tell you how to conduct yourselves outside your home, but since you have no manners and let your kids run around anyway and you've given yourself a night-off from dealing with them...now we've resorted to telling you how to discipline and raise your spawn. Sorry, not sorry!\""}
{"text":"Good:
1. Rolls - Large rolls, tasty, very similar to Osaka Sushi.

Neutral:
1. Lunch specials - Not really specials as they are still quite pricey.  Portions are large though.

Worth it?
Need to try more to judge but off to a good start food quality wise."}
{"text":"Haru Japanese Restaurant located right across from World Bowl where Cafe 28 used to be.

The set up is similar as before with a little bit of facelift which is much needed as the old deco was quite dated and depressing.

I could not review them based on their lunch special as it is only offered till 2:30 pm Monday to Friday. I got here at 2:45 and had to order from the regular menu.

Sushi & Roll Combo ($14.95) 
- good balance between portion of rice and fish and they all bite size
- shari rice cooked well with nice bite
- fish selection though boring with 3 of them being Salmon, tuna was not of the freshest kind

Portion though small but really nice for the chef to comp me a Salmon hand roll which was the best part of the meal. The seaweed was oh so crunchy!

Service though was really green. My waiter is like a high school kid trying to be professional. I wouldn't say is bad but he kind of freak out when I asked for the lunch menu after my sushi, kept telling me I could not order from it! I reassured him that all I want was just check it out...

There are also some Korean items in the menu if you do prefer that.

I will be back for lunch special to try out their Korean offerings soon."}
{"text":"This is my go-to sushi place! I bring all my friends and family here whenever I want sushi!"}
{"text":"Originally I rated 4* for this place for having good food and service for a Thursday lunch hour.  However I came again tonight with my friends and concluded that this is not a kids friendly place. They put up a sign that explicitly tell parents to control their kids not to cry or make loud noise to distract other diners, I found this notice kind of intimidating and feeling stressed through out of dinner since we're having dinner with 4 adults and 4 children."}
{"text":"3.5

Came here around 1PM for a quick lunch. I was super excited to try Haru since the Yelp reviews were really good and the guy in front of me waiting had a printed excel spreadsheet of TWENTY takeout requests from his friends... so this place HAD to be AMAZING right?!?! 

One salmon teriyaki bento box and sashimi lunch later, I was pretty underwhelmed. I mean, the service was EXTREMELY friendly and the family-run business staff definitely seemed to enjoy what they did... but the sushi rice was completely off. The grains were a little undercooked and they put WAY too much sugar - my lips were super sticky while I was eating.

Overly sticky rice aside, the actual sashimi was incredibly fresh and tasteful. But be warned, the \"12\" pieces of sashimi include two pieces of imitation crab meat!!!  (what a crime against sushi lovers right?!!!) 

The salmon teriyaki was decently good too. I really appreciated the complimentary orange-dressed asian salad and choice of mango, green tea, and red bean ice cream to complete the meal.

Overall, apart from the inconsistent sushi rice, the nice/clean environment coupled with tasteful dishes defines Haru as a good but not a I DEFINITELY NEED TO COME HERE type of place."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi with reasonable portions. If you don't feel like \"all you can eat\" this is a good place to go for some tasty chow. I had the spider roll and shrimp tempura roll and they were both very tasty. Definately a place to return too. Eat well friends!"}
{"text":"If you're not in the mood to go AYCE but need your sushi fixings, this is a great alternative. The portions are 'Sushi Bong' worthy and the lunch deals are generous (size and value!) There are so many different options (they even have a photo book of all their food items) and it's such a great deal for your choice of sushi, salad, soup and ice cream. While my boyfriend found his shrimp tempura sushi stale, I quite enjoyed the sushi quality of my spicy salmon roll. We came on a Sunday afternoon when there were very few people so the service was exceptional and very attentive. They also had a sign that said they don't split bills on Thursday and Friday lunch so it might be busier then."}
{"text":"This was our first time experience at Haru =)

We weren't very hungry so we only ordered the Sunshine Rainbow roll and an order of Spicy Pork Bulgogi that includes a salad, soup and bowl of rice.

First, we were greeted nicely and treated very well from beginning to end. The staff was very diligent, considerate, and well-mannered (4:40pm). Seeing as how there was only 2 of us, they still delivered 2 bowls of rice, 2 bowls of miso soup (which wasn't salty or very diluted - just right!) and 2 small bowls of salad that had their unique mango dressing lightly drizzled on top! Usually one entree comes with one of each (not including the special roll order).

Our special roll and entree came pretty quick and did not disappoint! The sunshine rainbow roll that was made with assorted salmon, tuna, shrimp, white fish, on top of avocado, cucumber, fish eggs, spicy scallops and tempura bits topped with their own spicy Haru sauce! A very good and well-made roll (nothing really protruding making the roll look uneven) while giving flavours of freshness from the amount of cucumber and avocado, along with texture from the tempura bits mixed with fresh fish pieces and their Haru sauce! A really well balanced roll of taste that wasn't overly moist or squishy.

The Spicy Pork bulgogi was perfectly spiced (for our liking) and not overly sweet with sauce. This leads me to believe that the pork is marinated very well or the sauce used is home-made and not from a jar. The meat slices were cut thin but plenty provided. It was a good portion of fatty pork slices and lean pork slices. Regardless if this was on purpose or not, we appreciated the majority of the fatty pork slices at the bottom when served on the hot plate. And as you can see none of the pork was over cooked meaning the chef/cook pulled it off the heat allowing for it to cook a little by the time it got to the table. Thus, none of it was dry or charred!

Definitely will be coming back to this Korean and Japanese sushi  restaurant to try more! =)"}
{"text":"100 reviews with a 4 star review? Had to come and try.

Came here with a coworker for lunch, and arrived into a small restaurant bustling with almost full capacity tables on a weekday at 12. That's a really good sign. It's definitely a restaurant that is a Yelp find, as it is tucked away in a plaza that you wouldn't probably visit. We went for the bento/lunch combos; I ordered the beef teriyaki bento box, he had the dynamite/california roll combo and we split a green dragon + 3 sushi combo as well. It's safe to say, we were STUFFED.

Beef Teriyaki Bento Box
I was okay with this. Nothing tasted bad but I probably wouldn't order this again (I'd try something else). The portions were quite small and I was not that full after, and the prices I found were a little higher than other bentos at about $13-15.

Green Dragon + 3 Sushi
This was about $10 I believe... or a little higher, but these rolls were MASSIVE. Each piece was about the size of a baby's hand. The struggle was real to fit the whole thing in your mouth. It comes with 10 pieces too (if my memory serves me right!). It was really good. Everything was fresh and I enjoyed this dish. My partner said everything was delicious, but tbh he says that about almost everything haha.

Service was pretty good. They did the loud greeting thing and was very nice. Unfortunately since it was so busy, we did not really receive much service aside from the ordering/bringing of the food. They seemed very genuine though.

4/5. I am not the biggest a la carte sushi person but I'd recommend it for any sushi craving."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise in an otherwise nondescript location.  Fresh fish and good service.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"After being a regular here for more than 2 years, I thought I would post some additional insight.

They changed their policy on who gets to get free miso soup and salad. I say it's not a loss if you don't get them because they're small in portion sizes anyways. The miso soup isn't overly salty like other places.

The tempura here is my still favourite, not too dry, moist or oily. The batter isn't thick which is my preference.

The broth and stuff they put inside the vegetable udon is also still my favourite. My tip is to avoid ordering any udon with meat as you will be surely disappointed in the little chunks of overcooked meat you struggle to find in the soup. 

Any dish with meat is overpriced like the beef teriyaki. The portion of meat is just too small. I really like the Japanese style hamburger because it was delicious but the portion didn't match the price. Kalbi is too expensive in my opinion but much higher quality than every other meat.

Raw fish quality varies a lot. Most of the time it's acceptable. Sometimes it's excellent (for the price) and other times it's on par with AYCE sushi. I find that sushi quality deteriorates during the winter months but improves drastically during spring and summer time. However, you have to take into account the price. It's about $1 for every piece of sushi if you order the combos so it's not expensive. I learned to lower my standards because of this. Do not order the beef tataki. It's a rip-off because the quality is so so so soooo bad.

They have a wide selection of sushi rolls you can choose from. I am not a big roll fan however I do enjoy some from time to time. Some particular ones I've enjoyed are the Lion King Roll and the Teenager Roll. The Teenager Roll has cream cheese in it so it's not for everyone.

I love their complimentary mango ice cream. I can't leave without having it. 

I visit Haru about once every month and I have never had a problem with bad service. While there are a lot of things I don't like about this place, I keep coming back because I learned to order the right dishes and the experience is never terrible. The portion to price ratio is still excellent (besides the meat dishes) and I am always full by the time I leave."}
{"text":"My gf and I visited over the weekend and it wasn't too busy due to the chilly weather.   We shared a sushi and sashimi combo and black dragon roll as well as a few apps.  The sushi and sashimi were very fresh as was the shrimp tempura.  Portions were generous as well.  The service was friendly and efficient amd overall this is one of the better Japanese options in the area."}
{"text":"Nice little busy Sushi spot in Silicon Valley North (at least that was what it was called back in the day).
Among a lot of Chinese restaurants, this Korean run Sushi spot seems to be very popular.  Been here twice in two days - both lunches - one for biz and one with family.
The fish is fresh, the service was good, and a decent value for lunch."}
{"text":"Went for the first time last night.  Its so close to where I lived. I'm kicking myself for not coming sooner!

I didn't go for the sushi and sashimi, others in my group did and said it was great, fresh and nicely cut.  

I got the beef bulgogi. I got it because when I walked into the restaurant the smell was amazing. The waiter said it was the bulgogi. I sacrificed sashimi.  

It was delicious. I'd never had bulgogi before. Lean thin strips of beef, thin sliced zucchini, onions, carrots, peppers, and mushrooms. The sauce. I can't even describe it. It was so good. 

The dinner came with green salad, miso soup, and green tea ice cream. 

I'll go back for sure. I feel like this is going to be my new go to place."}
{"text":"Waiting over 30mins for food and dishes is completely unacceptable. Although the sushi is pretty decent however I couldn't tell if I was just too hungry. The Haru roll is definitely a must try. Everything else was pretty standard."}
{"text":"Service is SO slow!! And Haru is very tiny inside (and busy), so it really can't keep up with NEW customers coming in. They don't have staff to greet them! Once you're seated, you have to wait patiently for the one and only waitress to see you. 

At first I wanted regular sushi on a nice boat and maybe a spider roll, but my friend refused to be normal and boring and said I'm too normal and boring. Argh. So my table of three ordered 3 Special Rolls and they will fill you up!!

I didn't like the Lion King $15.99 roll because of the cream cheese. Lion Kin is B.B.Q Eel, soy bean paper, cream cheese, shrimp tempura, cucumber, fish eggs, salmon.

Dancing roll $11.99 was very good!!! It's sweet mango sauce on top, spicy salmon, cucumber, shrimp tempura."}
