{"text":"Food: 4/5 Service: 4/5 Atmosphere: 3.5/5  Food: Meat platter: good for sharing, consists of different meats including: pork jowl (delicious), beef (cooked very well, texture wasn't too chewy) and chicken thigh and drumstick (flavour was good but hard to share). It came with the ginger and green onion sauce, which I love.  Soft shell crab rice: my favourite but a bit on the salty side. Papaya salad: with octopus . Refreshing on a hot day but nothing extraordinary.  Their version of The beef spring roll?: the meat was the wrap, which surrounded a mouthful of cilantro. I hate cilantro,  so needless to say I hated this dish, I didnt know when I ordered it. There aren't any descriptions under each item, so you have to ask the waiter. We did but I still failed to comprehend I guess. So warning: stay away from this dish if you aren't a fan of cilantro.  Dessert was this yam and coconut ice cream? We weren't really sure what we were eating. Not sure if the yam was infused into the ice cream or if it was the bread-textured purple cubes under the ice cream. It is something interesting to try if you are feeling adventurous.  I personally wouldn't order it again.  Service: Great service. Our waiter was very informative and patient, especially since we had to ask him what everything on the menu was. For some reason,  he was insistent on us ordering everything at the same time. We had a friend who came later, so we wanted to order her dish after, but he seemed to be highly aversed to it.   Atmosphere: The decor is beautiful. There are no signs on the door. It looks like a regular home from the outside.  The place is small. It's fun and intimate to bring a date because you can sit closer. Having said that, when you are going with four other girlfriends, whom you have known for many years,  it was a little crowded for me. The five of us sat at a table for 4. These tables are smaller than  the regular sized tables. Our dishes couldn't all fit on the table, along with our drinks. So I didnt like having to rush to finish a dish.  Fun place to try, but not a place I would go back to again. Maybe I can the soft shelled crab rice to go?"}
{"text":"Pretty cool joint, definitely worth a try if you're in the area. Food and drinks were pretty good. I got the Saigon rock, pho beef dip and bone marrow. The pho beef dip is a must try. The bone marrow was good, just wished there was more marrow. Basically marrow brushed onto sliced beef wrapped around cilantro with sweet and tangy soy. If you don't like cilantro, don't get it. I love cilantro so it was good."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Awesome staff who make you feel at home. Delicious food. Go there and have fun. You feel like you are in another country or an alternate reality. Full of colour, sass and good cheer. So fun!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed their take on classic Vietnamese dishes/flavour especially the mango papaya salad and the pork jowl platter. The purple yam smash was interesting though as it was sweet/savoury/salty not my favourite but still would come to this spot again to try out the other menu items!"}
{"text":"This place is literally a hole in the wall but we decided to give it a try after it was featured on BlogTO. The hype may be real but for me it was a complete downer! We were told it's an hours wait when we arrived. They took our number down and promised to give us a call once a table was available. We arrived at 8.25 pm and after waiting for just over an hour, at 9.46, when we went to ask about our table, we were addressed very rudely and told to check out other places nearby. That behavior, no matter how good an establishment is, is unacceptable. There are plenty of other thai/viet cafes around. So pinky's is definitely a no go for us!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is cool. Random house on a residential street. Drinks are great. I liked my mango thingy. Food is good. I don't know though, there's just something that doesn't quite feel and taste like authentic Vietnamese food about this place, and that's why they get a 3 star rating. I suppose that's where the fusion aspect of it comes in.   I think the best thing we had was the BBQ platter, but again doesn't taste like authentic Vietnamese grilled meats.   Would I go back? Probably in several months but not next week."}
{"text":"The food, the service, and atmosphere are all some of the best in Toronto.   On my first visit I enjoyed the ceviche, rice, and marrow. On my second the grill platter, eggplant clay pot, and Saigon broccoli. All were incredibly inventive and delicious. Don't sleep on the eggplant clay pot, it was by far my favorite dish of the three.  Both times we sat at the bar and were served by the bartender. He is super friendly, just the right amount of attentive, and knowledgeable of everything on the menu.  They have a delicious jalapeno vodka at Pinky's, and even though it's only featured in one of their cocktails he was happy to throw together a vodka soda with it for me .  The vibe is amazing, as others have said walking through the door is like walking into a family owned cantina somewhere in southeast Asia."}
{"text":"With neon lights, pumping music, and the red glow from lanterns, the vibe here is awesome! We came here right when it opened since they don't accept reservations.  The Tiger's Milk ceviche has giant chunky bits of seafood with crispy crisps.  I'd order this again for sure.  The bone marrow was more decorative, spicy, and unique than expected!  The grill platter takes a bit longer to make but worth the wait.  The mini lettuce wraps were fun!  We loved it here and we'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for Pinky's, but I enjoyed the idea of this Ca Phe more than actually being there.  The good: Tiger's Milk Ceviche was a satisfyingly creamy, coconut concoction (ohohoho - and they say high school English is useless...).  The broth of the You Dip, I Dip banh mi was so dang delicious, that I'd actually dare to say it's the best pho broth I've ever tasted.  The bad: Everything else.  Asked for a knife to cut the banh mi (as we were 3 people), but was curtly told \"No knives.\" before our server swiftly turned and walked away. As in...you don't have any available right now, or none in the house? \"No knives at all.\"  Overheard other tables asking for the same cutlery, and friendlier servers replied, \"Yeah, sorry, we don't offer knives and the kitchen refuses to cut the sandwich.  We don't know why.\"  Our table ended up MacGyvering it by using my brothers' utility pocket knife, cleaned off by sanitizer.    Marrow beef has no marrow taste.  Were it not to have \"marrow\" in the dish title and were it not served on the bone, I would've thought they were just beef rolls.  Portions were extremely small, with prices being high for such tiny plates of food (made for ants?).  We literally ordered one of every item off the menu, and still left hungry enough to want to eat a whole other meal.  My first visit to Pinky's will be my last."}
{"text":"We lucked out when we visited Pinky's Ca Phe, there is usually a super long line up, but we went around the Christmas holidays and our party of 3 were seated right away at the side bar right near the kitchen. The tiger milk ceviche is one of their staples and it did not disappoint, the fish and clams were fresh and limey good. One of the dishes that stood out to me most is the claypot eggplant, it's salt and pepper flavours blended well and soaked into the eggplant very nicely."}
{"text":"Wow this is definitely one of the best restaurants I've been to in Toronto.  We came here on a Saturday night and we were in a rush.  We were able to be seated, order, eat, drink and leave the restaurant all in under 1 hr.  I would describe the food as Vietnamese tapas, it's definitely meant to be shared.  Highly recommend this spot!  Tigers milk ceviche: 9/10 - one of the best ceviches I've ever had, loaded with fish and the taro chips were a perfect complement  French dip with pho broth: 8.5/10 - the broth was much fattier than I'm used to but I really liked it. Dipping the brisket sandwich in it was heavenly.  Marrow beef: 10/10 - this was my favorite dish of the night.  I don't even know what was in it but it tasted amazing  Fly rice: 8/10 - just a typical fried rice, biggest dish of the night"}
{"text":"Positives: Fun, interesting (you'd be forgiven for thinking you're walking into a local residence only to be surprised by a bar set up out of Good Morning Vietnam), friendly and bigger than proprietor's other establishments  Weakness: Food is still not comparable to Odd Seoul; or Hanmoto   Repeat: Perhaps   Notes: Cannot make reservations here."}
{"text":"A magical place with flavourful food. You step into this little house and its like you are transported away from Toronto into a place with delicious food and drinks and amazing service  I am still dreaming about the mushroom vermicelli and the tigers milk ceviche was some of the best cevice I have ever had.  Be warned that you may have to wait for a table. But it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Asian fusion has become a big trend in the city of Toronto. This hidden restaurant is inside an old home, you need to keep your eyes peeled because it's easily missed! The food presentation is fabulous, but it's very deceiving. I found the quality of the food wasn't great. I got the bone marrow, which to my eyes looked very tasty, but it was actually very dry. We also got the rice, the noodles which both weren't bad, and the pepper drink (I forgot what it was called, but that was the most interesting drink I have ever had with a good kick!) so over all, it was an okay restaurant - with of course a long wait period (1hr for a table of two...at the bar)... to have okay food. In my opinion it's not worth the wait, and I probably wouldn't suggest it or come back. It's just one of those places we're you hear a lot about that isn't worth the hype. Don't get my wrong the food isn't horrible, but for the wait time.... i wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"FOOD 4.5 stars. PRICE 3 stars. SERVICE 3 stars. ATMOSPHERE 3.5 stars.  We came here on Valentine's Day at very late night.  I asked one of my friend, \"@hungry_foodie, Anh.T\" where was a romantic place for late night dinner.  She suggested me that Pinky's Ca phe might be a good answer.    We came here about 11 p.m. There weren't busy at this time.  They sat us on the bar seats.  I actually didn't like the bar seats but it didn't say anything lol. How funny I was again!  We ordered two dishes, \"SO FLY RICE and LUCKY STRIP.\"  For drinks, we got \"PINKY'S DAIQUIRI and beer\"  Their food was delicious.  My husband enjoyed his steak and his beer. I love my FLY fried rice!  It was mixed with the lovely ingredients like soft shell crab and fish roe.  I love these things!  It tasted a bit spicy, sour and salty.  It was perfect for me.  I really love it! It went well with my Pinky's cocktail.  Sweet!  The downside of this restaurant is the price and the size of the place.    Before I came here, I didn't do research very well lol.  I didn't expect that the place was small, very dark and their seats were close to each other.  Don't get me wrong!  It doesn't mean that I don't like this place.   We like their food and drinks.  But some of their dishes are a bit overpriced and I didn't expect to have a bar seat on Valentine's day.   I should have spoken up next time!  lol  Would I come back here again? Yes!   P.S. Thanks again to @hungry_foodie, Anh.T."}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago with a girlfriend of mine. As soon as I walked in I already loved the vibe. Felt like I was walking into my aunts basement in the 90s for a party. Loved the rustic, vintage looking decor. Music was great. Food was also good. Also who wouldn't love a vietnamese-Cambodian snack bar?!  I would definitely order the vermicelli bowl and lobster rice again. The banh mi? Not so much since it was overly sauced and had too much pâté in it. Get ready to share your table with two other strangers if it's only going to be two of you. I personally didn't mind because it contributed to the hip and fun atmosphere! Also, if you can't tolerate any spicy food, you better train yourself to before coming here. In terms of prices you are looking at about $10-$16 dollars per small plate. $12 cocktails. $8 for a pint of beer. Overall, great concept and well executed. I would definitely return to Pinky's Ca Phe."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is something else. The place is a house and perhaps looks like a weed dealer's house with a street sign coloured red light coming though the window. The decor is very eye catching. The style is eclectic and almost reminiscent of like a tiki lounge but more styled towards a south Asian feel. The music is straight up hip-hop and J. Cole's GOMD could be heard as you dine. If you don't know that song YouTube it to get a sense what to expect.   The first thing I have to say is the safest bet is to arrive around 6 but this is only my best guess. This place gets packed quick and continues to stay busy even into the later hours of the night. You can expect to wait 1.5 to 2 hours if you arrive at 7pm without calling ahead. Also there is basically only one bench seat with two seats if you're planning to tough out the wait. This place is structured to be more like tapas so the drink menu has quite a few options (and the reason why we people linger) and the plates are on the smaller size but I must say the flavors are exquisite.   The bone marrow has no bone marrow per se but the beef is brighten by the acid and tender as can be. Also if you don't like cilantro don't get this dish but if you do it's a huge delight. The salad was a great contrast in texture compared to the beef. Again another dish with bright acidity and good crunch. The ceviche was a good balance with a less acidic taste in comparison to all the other dishes and ceviches I've ever tasted but it had a more well rounded taste thanks to whatever the milk component is.   I would recommend not getting the Tres Leches cake despite its interesting composition it's eats quite heavy and come in the the worst presentation compared to all the other food we had which tasted and looked better. My girlfriend would like to note that it finishes with a slight sour taste to the point that she considered that it had perhaps gone bad (I'm writing this review weeks later and we were fine afterwards, so it's how it's supposed to taste.... I suppose) If you're curious I would say share between 4 people at the end of the meal.   The service here is great and don't expect sympathy from the hostess as she writes your name down and tells you what the wait is like. In fact this night we waited the 2 hours and saw the glee she had as she crossed people's names off as they could not stand to wait so long for food or drinks. Overall this place was an experience and I'm glad I experienced it. If I remember to call ahead or am having an early meal I would definitely recommend or inviting ppl for drinks, again call ahead. If you're reading about this restaurant and wanna just try it on a whim I would say have a back up. Which I than recommend Bi Bim Bap just around the corner and you can read my review on that experience."}
{"text":"I can't justify anything higher than 3 stars. Food was ok. Service was great and the ambiance would easily be a 5 but for the super uncomfortable seating. Unfortunately, if you eat here, you're getting fucked up the ass by hipsters. No lube.  My real issue at Pinky's is the cost if the food items that are basically super cheap to make but feature only a few flakes of protein. While the \"Flied Rice\" was delicious, my friend and I had to search through the dish for the soft shell crab. I really disliked that the server brought over the dish, which looked beautiful and then hacked though the whole thing tossing it all together at the table and leaving us to rummage through the mess. Why not pour the dressing over and leave the guest to enjoy the presentation and toss their own rice? Instagram fail.  The ceviche was probably my favourite. Coconut milk made is a little richer than traditional ceviche without sacrificing flavour. I was excited about the charcoal grilled chicken legs, but they fell flat, lacking any real umami and just tasting like charcoal. Mushroom vermicelli was tasty but a complete rip off! Nothing about this dish justifies the price.  Cocktails, which I don't often indulge in, were very well made.  It didn't suck, but for the price, I felt like I did."}
{"text":"What a cool experience! It was like being in a secret restaurant hideout. We arrived shortly after 6pm on a Wednesday so we got seated right away, but it didn't take long for the place to fill up, so come early! My friend and I got a mojito with a can of exotic fruit juice tipped upside-down in it, sort of like a Vietnamese twist on a Mexican bulldog. Not very strong, but quite tasty! The mixed drinks are a bit pricey, but the experience is worth it.   The plates are perfect to share, aside from the pho beef dip. (It's so good, you'll want to get your own. Plus they can't cut it in half.) The atmosphere is great, with so many things to look at in the house and moody jazz music playing all evening. The tables are a bit close together but the bar stools were a good distance apart from each other (no bumping elbows at the counter!). I would highly recommend the eggplant pot, the pho beef dip, and the dulce de leche cake (don't be fooled by its McCain cake appearance... that thing is delicious). I would definitely go back again. Great spot to bring a friend or significant other...leave bigger groups behind."}
{"text":"Obnoxiously priced. Not worth the wait. Sure the food tastes good, but nothing really spectacular. Medium quality ingredients with tiny portions:   We had:  - eggplant for $10. Similar flavour to food court  - grilled chicken legs. $18. Tasty lemongrass chicken, similar to what you would find at traditional  viet resto or pho place for half the price - beef marrow: no beef or marrow, more like a coriander wrap - ceviche: this was tasty avacado and stuff. Hard to see because of very dim lighting. But again overpriced at $16 - papaya salad: average. Grilled octopus was good, but not wow: meagre portion   You see a theme. Decent food at 2x prices. Same with drinks. Cool place, though stools get uncomfortable.   Don't understand the hype."}
{"text":"Excellent !!! The Ceviche and fried rice are my fave items on the menu. Fair warning that the tables are small, the light low and the volume of diners loud! Very Toronto hipster but/and a top resto!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is worth the cramped quarters. You arrive and are immediately whisked away from Toronto to... another place. Another.. very Vietnamese place. Dinner is enjoyed on stools in cozy tables under the glow of fluorescent Tiger and Tsing Tao beer signs with the sounds of old East Asian torch songs in the background.   The food: Tiger's Milk Ceviche: an absolute winner with tender hunks of fish in a perfectly balanced Tom Yum and coconut sauce.  Bone Marrow: another winner, mixing rare/raw rolls of beef, beef marrow, cilantro and vegetables in a spicy (but not HOT spicy), perfect bite. Mushroom Vermicelli: Expertly cooked with a good variety of mushrooms Grilled meat platter: Grilled chicken, pork jowl and beef. An excellent way to get your protein in. Good, but without the \"WTF this is so gooodddd\" reaction of the other dishes.  Come with friends, have some cocktails (the spiceman is good) and order everything on the menu. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"the food here was absolutely addictive. The broccoli was was like candy, it left me wanting more. The flavors of the grilled eggplant sent me right back to the streets of Hanoi I visited years ago. The mushroom vermicelli had the perfect blend of sweet and savoury. Not to mention the decor here rocks. Best meal I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"I am actually unsure about how I feel about this place. The moment you enter, it's like you have been transported to another era and country.  The vibe and decor is incredible. The actual seating though is a little tight and crammed. We barely had space to put our purses, let alone our jackets! I almost wanted to leave because of our cramped and claustrophobic the seating felt, but I am glad I didn't because the food was mind-blowing! We had the milk ceviche and were blown away, like everyone else in the city, it seems. The bahn mi was my personal favourite, with laughing cow cheese and meat, it was bursting with so much flavour! The dessert (yam with ice-cream) was creative, different and yummy. We also had a beef curry in a clay pot which was good but nothing out of this world. The drinks are watered down and tastes very mediocre. The price point is quiet high and expensive but I think if you're in the area, you should try this place at least once. Cool experience."}
{"text":"Great vibe! It's in a house - cozy with neat decor. For 2 ppl, we ordered the following to share (in order of most fav to least fav):  Vermicelli with mushrooms Tiger ceviche Bone marrow Short ribs  The vermicelli was light and tasty, lots of dif kinds of mushrooms in it. The ceviche had a nice texture and the sauce tasted of curry/coconut. The marrow came in a bone but I didn't taste marrow. It actually turned out to be beef rolls of some sort sitting on the bone. I guess the marrow got incorporated into the rolls (which were tasty, but the marrow got overshadowed by the other ingredients). The short ribs were our least fav...they were burnt and oddly came with lettuce wraps even though the meat was bone-in.  For dessert we got the purple yam with condensed milk and ice cream. It was different. Not my dessert of choice though.  We each ordered drink which we both very much enjoyed. I got the spicemaster which reminded me of an amaretto sour, and my friend got the pink lady which was lighter and more fragrant.  All in all, a fun experience! We went on a monday night and it was packed. They don't take reservations...so show up early to get a table!"}
{"text":"prob won't be back here again. service was terrible..I don't know if we were just unlucky but there were only two servers and 1 bartender. And the servers were short and abrupt! would have given this place 2-stars bc of the service but the food and cocktails were pretty tasty, although portions were small and expensive.   also, they reuse the bone they use to serve the bone marrow dish in. We know this is true because we (jokingly, but not jokingly) asked to take the bone home for our friend's dog and the server spilled the beans lol"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever... I was telling my friend on our way out of the restaurant that I would never return.  We didn't book a table but we were able to get in without lining up. The server placed us at the end of the restaurant, right in front of the kitchen. it's like a bar setting, no table and no where to place our stuff at all. I placed my coat on my lap and my friend put it under the counter. The space is so limited that we were sitting still in front of our bar counter. The smallest move would maybe cause an accident.  We ordered the pho beef sandwich, the eggplant clay, and the sticky chicken. waited for almost 45 minutes. We were starving. After all this time waiting, they came up to us and said: here is your Broccoli... No apologies and they just left.   Finally, we got the small beef sandwich for $10, a small pot of small pieces eggplant for another $10 and the sticky chicken was not sticky at all but stiff. I was unable to eat the eggplant as it was too sweet and too salty at the same time. I asked for some bread to eat with it. They charged me $2 for the 2 pieces of bread.  Now, it's time to pay, the card machine only showed one tip option: 20%. If I didn't look for the Other option, I would have paid this amount of tip which they did not deserve. My friend didn't find the Other option ended up paying 20% for a really bad experience.  A place to avoid."}
{"text":"If you're thinking of going to Pinky's - get there early! We arrived at 7 pm on a Saturday night and waited over an hour for a table for 2.  Tiger milk ceviche, sticky chicken fingers, banh xeo broccoli and fly rice - highly recommend these dishes, especially the ceviche!  Drinks are strong and tasty. We both ordered the Mango Foco-loco, which is their spin on a mojito.  The ambiance feels dark and moody, and you almost feel like you transported back in time to someone's house turned restaurant.  All in all, we had a great experience. Took off one star because the front hostess was pretty rude/grumpy to us and other customers the entire time we waited - someone tell her it's okay to smile."}
{"text":"This one just squeezed into one of my rare 5 star favorites like squeezing lemon or oranges into juice.  On it's own, it's healthy and good to eat.  Maybe bitter or sour but add a bit of honey or sugar, it's excellent and quenches your thirst.  Pinky's is just like that.  There were elements that put this cute and quirky place into flavour.  1) Location. I love that it's just off a commercial ribbon strip in downtown Toronto.  It is unassuming and not even a notice that it is a restaurant or even Vietnamese, let alone more accurately Cambodian. 2) Unpretentious.  You don't get that fancy overly done \"Hey come look at me and check me out\" BIG restaurant vibe.  They don't showboat like American food chains tend to do.   3) Local Community vibe.  This is so important for me when I want to dine out somewhere.  I'm tired of processed, made from a freezer and fried foods.  Restaurants tend to try to go the cheap way with food and wow you with their presence, not the flavours.   4) Food that is created and thought through enough that it can be easily replicated for consistency but also the flavours and presentations come through with every bite and every dish created from their kitchen.  If I ordered one dish, and then the same another day, it would be at least similar and if not the same.  (or you would hope depending on who's making it.).  This is important. Wouldn't you think? 5) Staffing.  They're the front line of  business.  They talk to the consumer and start off on placing the restaurant on the right path for the consumer to enjoy his/her/their meal and experience. 6) Recommendation by Dinah and Barry Koo.  Two local chefs / caterers / food consultants / Gourmet food connoisseurs and authors in the Toronto area who I would agree as being one of the early creators of what is today's craze; \"Asian Fusion Amuse-bouche\".  I know I have written about Dinah and vlogged about her in a few of my past reviews and videos.  I do have to give her credit for me loving the food the way that I do.  She recommended this as one of my go to's to try on my most recent visit to Toronto and I am so very pleased that we came and tried it out. 7) Vibe: This place is bohemian, urban, cool, chic and a reminder of what I remember about living in the downtown area / College /Kensington /Chinatown / Dundas / Queen / Spadina area.  Back in the 80's I lived on Major street and Brunswick and these areas were my local haunts when I worked in lived here.  I still feel like I have this connection after so many years.  It must be the sentimentality of being old...er.  Oh Kay... now lets talk about our experience of dining here. I had come with a work colleague from overseas Asia and wanted him to try out some of Toronto's unique culinary vibe in this area.  Consider this. I was staying up in Mississauga and Brampton and you Yelpers kinda know what food is like up there..... yahhsss.  You know right?  As much as you'd like to say it's great, when you consider the food options to the big city,  there is no comparison.   We come downtown after work and park and walk a few blocks to get to this place on a Tuesday night.  The street isn't really that busy @ 6pm for parking but decided we wanted to walk a bit anyways.  Get a feeling for the area again like a haptic memory sensation preview before the meal.  Turn the corner walk 50 paces to the first house on the right and there it is.  In all it's unassuming glory.  Nary a sign of what exists inside.  We didn't get to eat everything and instead ordered what was familiar to me and what I saw from other Yelpers pics.  Tiger's Milk Ceviche.  Really?  The name itself had my mind going overboard with exotic mammary thoughts.  It was actually a ceviche with scallops, clams, tuna, avocado and coconut milk and some tom yum flavouring.  Oh yes. definately order this dish.  A must. I wanted to order more. Another MUST have is the Marrow Beef.  Imagine butter beef done up like sushi rolls presented on a big bone as a plate.  Yes. If I could. I'd have a bone  err ummm yeah. for this dish.  I could eat five orders of these and walk out fattened, saturated and satisfied like a drunk zombie stumbling out of a bar past midnight.  The Papaya (mango) salad was my reluctant surprise.  The grilled squid was the coup de grâce that topped it all off for us. I initially ordered it because I wanted something fresh and bold and crispy.  After weeks of eating subpar franchised food and feeling sick from it all. I needed a bit of zestiness.  In this dish. I got all of what I wanted and more.  We just kept munching away to each other in partially stuffed giggles of delight over the  squid and the sauce and the fruit.   In all the dishes there was a bit of heat from the chilies that garnished the tops, of which I would try to steal as much as I could for myself. There is so much more to write about this place but you'll have to go and experience it yourself.  The couple next to us were raving each dish as much as we did!"}
{"text":"The latest addition to the Leemo Han legacy. Had it not been for the number of recent posts on social media, I would not have known about this place. And similarly to Hanmoto, if you are walking down the street, it is easy to pass by this place, not thinking there's a restaurant within this house. Considering my positive experiences at OddSeoul and Hanmoto, I had to check this place out.  We went on a Thursday around 6:30 PM, and had several options for seating. It got busier throughout our meal, and by the time we left, there was a bit of a wait to get seated. We started with Foco Loco's which contains different liquors and herbs depending on which Loco flavour you get. I got the mango, which was muddled with mint and made with rum.  We ended up splitting 5 dishes, though 4 would've been sufficient because by the fifth dish, we started to slow down. In order from least favouite to most favourite: - Marrow Beef ($15): shaved beef rolls atop of bone marrow; a bit messy to eat - Banh Xeo Broccoli ($7): think broccoli tempura - Pho Beef Dip-You-Dip-I-Dip ($10): beef baguette with a pho broth to dip - Luk-Lac Beef Short Ribs ($18): sweet short ribs, prepared on the grill outside - Tiger's Milk Ceviche ($12): a coconut creamy mix of seafood, tasting a bit like Tom Yum  Overall, an interesting take on Vietnamese food, and everything we got was, for the most part, pretty damn good!"}
{"text":"I love this place. We went right around 5:30/6pm on a weekday, so there was no wait yet! Their food, drinks, aura and service is delightful!   We had their special curry that day (which I wish had more bread though), and their BBQ Platter!   We sat in the front room, and it was very hot (this was during sunset and we were having hot food, which is reasonable), but it didn't seem like they had a/c - so beware!   The washroom reminded me of those old movies with the green/pink sink - it was kind of eerie actually, but it definitely made me feel adventurous.   I will be back to try out more drinks and different dishes! I've got my eye on the Foco Loco Cocktail!"}
{"text":"Pinky Ca Phe is a Vietnamese inspired restaurant located in Little Italy by Leemo Han who is also responsible for OddSeoul and Hanmoto. The restaurant was considered one of the hottest new restaurants that opened in 2017. The restaurant is located inside a house at Clinton St and College St.  I went this past Saturday and got there at 6pm when the restaurant first opened and we were quickly seated right away. The restaurant is located on the main floor of the house so seating is limited. Inside it's dimly lit and very intimate but it's got a cool laid back vibe.  We ordered the Tiger Milk Ceviche ($14 plus tax), Marrow Beef ($15 plus tax) and Chicken Legs ($18 plus tax). Keep in mind that Pinky Ca Phe is a Vietnamese inspired restaurant, so you aren't going to get traditional Vietnamese dishes but more like Vietnamese fusion dishes. The thing is the dishes really work and the flavours are interesting, well executed and really good.  The Marrow Beef ($15 plus tax) was essentially torched rolled beef topped with fried garlic and shallots in a soy marrow dressing sitting on a marrow bone. The dish was delicious, tender beef, great seasoning and dressing and I'm sure they used lemongrass as a seasoning because it tasted like a traditional marinated butter beef Vietnamese dish.  The Tiger Milk Ceviche ($14 plus tax) was an Asian/Latin American fusion dish with a more Asian taste focus than a traditional Latin American ceviche which is normally more citrusy. This dish essentially was fresh yellowfin tuna, surf clam and scallops on a thai based curry broth dressed with taro chips. Really good dish with an Asian spin.  The Chickens Legs ($18 plus tax) were amazing, they were charcoal grilled Chicken Legs served on a bed of lettuce accompanied by a sauce. The Chicken Legs were perfectly cooked inside and had a nice charcoal char on the outside, if you wanted you could break off the chicken meat and wrap it in the lettuce and dip it in the sauce. The chicken was good enough on it's own.  Overall, Pinky Ca Phe is a really cool restaurant that serves some really good Vietnamese inspired food with some really good interesting flavours. The place is perfect for a group of friends, a date night or a first date since the food is meant for sharing and the place is dimly lit and intimate since it's small."}
{"text":"This place is so cute! Mind you, this place is a house that has been turned into a restaurant with a bar. Surprisingly it does seat quite a bit of people, but seats are small, tables are small and you best squeeze yourself between tables. The table we had had a little magazine rack on the side for us to place our coats in to save our sitting space.   We waited a while for the food, but considering they just opened last week, pretty sure they're still working stuff out. We ordered the Tiger's Milk Ceviche, \"So Fly\" rice and the combination grilled meats. The ceviche came with some taro chips and had chunks of avocado in it. It tasted great, but of the 2-3 bites I had, I had about 1 bit of shrimp. The \"so fly\" rice doesn't contain any pork or beef, which was important information to note for the company I was with, it was pretty good and we almost licked the bowl. Then came the grilled meats, which they have a charcoal grill placed outdoor in the back of the house. The platter came with chicken legs, pork jowl and beef short ribs. I really tasted the grill flavours and despite the wait, I think was worth it because you can't rush a grill. My favourite was the pork jowl. They give you lettuce so you can make it into a wrap.  My only issue was reading the menu. With the dimmed lighting and the unique hand written menu, it was a little difficult to read. Then I took a photo of the menu and it was slightly easier to read from my phone.  The table next to ours had 2 separate pairs of people sharing a table. I think you should expect to do so if you have less people."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of Leemo Han's work.   But i'm just not a fan of the Vietnamese Fusion. Cocktails were fun and interesting but I was a bit disappointed in the food. There wasn't a big WOW factor for me, definitely had better viet food for less.  Like the other establishments, it's also disguised as a house right off of the commercial strip. The atmosphere is popping like always. Good vibes with dim lighting.  Awesome place to hangout with friends over drinks and tapas."}
{"text":"Go here if you're in Toronto!! Service is great, food is excellent, and you can't beat the atmosphere. It's easily missed because it's an old house transformed into a magical hole in the wall. Once you step inside though, there's such a warm and homey vibe.   We got the ceviche, the fried rice, and the grill platter. Everything had balanced and interesting flavors. The star of the show is really the charcoal grill in the back where they whip up the amazing meats. They timed each course perfectly, and the service was friendly and attentive. And the cocktails are inventive and delicious.  All in all, Pinkys is the perfect package if you're looking for something unique that delivers without being gimmicky."}
{"text":"The first time you see this restaurant, you'll instantly think you're at someone's house. Because it literally is a house, turned into a restaurant. If the gate pushes open, they are open!   My girl friend and I arrived right at 6pm, when they open on a Thursday evening. The place is dimly lit, but still bright enough to see your food and the surroundings. We were told to sit at the Bar, because if it starts to get crowded we would have to share a table with others. (If you come as a pair, the bar is highly suggested!)   We ordered the Saigon Rock, which is basically a gin and tonic with a strong lime flavor. I actually enjoyed it a lot because it reminded me of the limeade my mom would always make.   For food we shared the Tiger's milk Ceviche, So Fly! Rice and the Wings.Let me just say that I would definitely get the Ceviche and the rice 100% again! The soft shell crab in the fried rice was cooked to perfection, and the seasoning made it so delicious! I highly recommend this dish!  Overall, I loved the atmosphere, the service and the food. It does get a little pricey and I wished that the food portion (especially the wings) was slightly bigger for the price."}
{"text":"Tried to go to Pinky's with 4 of my friends. Our waiter was extremely rude! Told us we had to squeeze into a tiny table or have one sit on a metal bike basket  Hippsters please make your resurants bigger and check your wait staff!!!!! Will tell everyone I know NOT TO GO THERE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pinky's Ca Phe, such a fun spot with a delicious menu that is priced just right. I arrived with my SO for a last minute Friday night date night, as they don't don't take reservations we stopped in and gave my cell #, we grabbed a drink nearby at The Walton and within 30 mins our little corner cozy table spot was ready. First impressions where how lively and otherworldly the vibe was, drinks were immediately served (beer for me, cold white vino for my lady) the menu has a bunch of cool sounding names but you need some direction if you want to get a better sense of what some of the items are and the staff are more than happy to chat about the menu. Everything we ate was delicious and fun: ceviche with tigers milk paired with homemade taro chips (so good), Marrow Beef (thin slices of beef wrapped around marrow, nori, onions and cilantro) I wanted to order a second bone...then we had the so fly rice which I wasn't sure about when I heard the combo of ingredients: fish roe, soft shell crab, egg, fish sauce, chilis,- I was expecting it to be too much but man if it didn't all line up perfectly for a balanced and playful dish.... We would have ordered more food but we were really only looking for a light bite WE will be back for sure as the rest of the grub flying out of the kitchen looked great: the BBQ platter looked particularly amazing and the dude sitting next to us gave a thumbs up when he caught me checking out his half consumed platter. If I had to find fault, when we sat down the top corner of our tiny table was a mess of sticky sauce but in fairness it's a dimly lit joint so I can guess it was an easy miss, no biggie, all in all a really fun and lively place with a cool menu (Vietnamese with a twist) it's tiny and almost feels like a pop up given the converted house on Clinton. For this East ender certainly worth the trek, and we're coming back soon..."}
{"text":"Unnecessarily overpriced and completely unprofessional staff. I was served by the female blonde server. I had ordered the broccoli ($7) and the mango popper drink ($12). Bill came out to $27 as I was clearly overcharged. When I tried to grab the servers attention I was ignored repeatedly.    In terms of taste the broccoli was basically a flavoured up tempura with oyster and fish sauce as dipping. The drink was a spicy and refreshing treat. Also tried my friend's clay pot which was decent. But honestly this is a city with tons of great food and with service/servers that bad and a business that cheats people like this it might be best just to stay away."}
{"text":"Place is hard to find as there are no signs and it is technically a house converted to a restaurant. My friends and I waited until 6 pm on  Thursday night for the restaurant to open their doors. We promptly found our seats in a uniquely decorated establishment. The place was filled by 7 pm so get here early or risk waiting a while before other patrons finish up.  The seats are kinda tight and you may want to hang your jackets at the front. They have a wide variety of drinks but I stuck with the beer on tap. Our first order was the Banh Xeo Broccoli which was the tempura vegetable. Nothing too special but lightly battered and the sauce was nice.   The Tiger's Milk Ceviche was recommended was nice but it was too dark inside to see all the ingredients.The bone marrow was unique as well and once recommended by the waitress. However, it is likely not for everyone. The wings were flavourful but small with only 2 full wings.  Overall, it is a good experience and parking closeby. Not the most comfortable for eating as the tables and seats were tight."}
{"text":"Food: A different spin on Vietnamese food which was refreshing and executed quite well. Had the Mango Slaw, Marrow Beef and the Tiger Milk Ceviche.  I did feel that the portion size could be better.  Price:  I would say it's $$$ not $$.    Service:  Service was standard.  The hostess was pretty accommodating even though the place is really packed and had a long waitlist  Ambiance: Good decor but the tables were really small and tight.  Notes: No reservations.  Come early or late prepare to wait for a bit."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Loved the Tigers Milk Ceviche & meat platter. The place is in a House, nothing flashy or fancy. Small space but cozy. So lively on a Thursday Night! Decor was really nice, dark ambience."}
{"text":"Loooooved this place. 5 stars, because although there were a couple of mishaps, it was aaaaalllll worth it.   We came here after grabbing a drink at The Walton, and we had to put our name down for 2 (no reservations). We were told it would be a long wait but we were okay with walking around. We got called after 20 minutes and when we came back, we still had to sit for 15 minutes. The host apologized saying that the table paid but was slowly enjoying dessert (which can be good that they didn't rush them out - means you won't get rushed out either!).   Ambiance - it felt like chris tucker and jackie chan were going to bust this place wide open any second. Lively, old music that I didn't recognize but definitely vibed with. Dim lights, tables a bit crowded, and there's random vietnamese books to peruse. People were talking and laughing and generally having a good time. Perfect contrast to our quiet drink at The Walton.   Food - small menu, maybe 15 items everything included? Is that small? It's all good because they have a variety of meats and vegetarian items, a variety of serving sizes, and its all for a good price. We had some BBQ items along with the fly rice and that was more than enough to fill us up.   Drinks - we had a couple cocktails each. a bit expensive, but worth it for sure. I like that the food is accessible but the drinks are elevated - it's a good combination!  I can't wait to come here again! It reminded me a bit of OddSeoul, but more lively."}
{"text":"A house converted resto in the College area. This is a unique small space with the feel of a local dive.  The menu is simple with few selections but all executed well.    We explored this Vietnamese Fusion place by accident and thought it gives the typical dished a nice twist. We started with the grilled calamari and mango salad and wings and they were phenomenally tasty!  Its sweetness and acidity blended really well with a tinch of chilli and coriander.    The Marrow Beef presented itself well and the beef roll was extremely tender. Nothing if what we were expecting given its name and it was a pleasant surprise.   The dishes were very small in portions so i am not sure if the restaurant intentionally positioned itself as a Vietnamese tapas place or not. But if so, they will need a bit more robust drinks selection to complement.   We were still a bit hungry after five dishes and decided to order their 'Fly' rice and it was sooooo good.    All in all, a great place to hangout with friends albeit the loud music!"}
{"text":"Pinky's has quickly become one of my favourite spots in Toronto.  I can't really give you anything specific to try on their menu, since everything I've had so far has been nothing short of fantastic. Take a look at the menu, pick out the first thing that piques your interest, and chances are you're going to enjoy it.  The place has a really dark and quiet ambiance. Seating is definitely limited, so I'd recommend keeping your party to a group of 4 or less. The wait staff is super friendly and never afraid to give you recommendations. The only hard part is finding the place! The owner(s) literally converted an old house on Clinton Street to a restaurant and it can be a little tricky to find at night.  Awesome place. Consider it for your next first date!"}
{"text":"The only redeeming thing about Pinky's is their \"ceviche\". While it's undeniably delicious, I wouldn't call it ceviche... but semantics aside, it's great. The service sucks (waiters who get defensive over meal substitution inquiries) so does the quality of their 25$ short ribs (chewy, tendony...ugh why). Don't get the eggplant clay pot--so boring. The food here is small, over priced, and pretentious."}
{"text":"I'm totally feeling this place for a fun night out!  It's only been opened a week and by 8pm was already packed!   It's located in Little Italy, in a house - so basically you are not sure if you are going into a restaurant or someone's place where they still haven't taken down the Christmas decorations. There are tables in the front and seating at the bar - it's a it tight and the seats are these low stools (no backs).  Quirky, fun, lively...these are the words I would use to describe this place.  We ordered a few things to share:  - The Tiger Milk Ceviche  - The So Fly Rice  - Combo platter - chicken wings/pork jowls/beef short ribs  while it did take a bit of time for our food to come out (they grill in the back so that and the fact they are new is probably why) it is worth the wait.  The Tiger Milk Ceviche had a real nice heat to it - it comes with these large tortilla chips that you can scoop up all that goodness.  The short ribs were tender and flavourful and the chicken was nice and juicy.   I don't eat pork so I can't comment on that, but others at my table liked it.  They give you lettuce and shredded veggies so you can make a wrap.  The rice was ok - I wish it had a bit more heat, but I generally prefer my food with a bit of kick.  I probably wouldn't order this again.  Overall a quirky, fun and lively place.  I'll definitely check this place out again"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of Hanmoto or OddSeoul, you will probably be a fan of this place because it's another creation by the same restaurateur. A very district restaurant in a small house on Clinton St/College but the interior decoration is colourful with tinsels and lanterns.   There were no lines because we went on a weekday soon after opening. If you're a group of two, they will only give you a bar seat. This might be uncomfortable/feel cramped if you are carrying a lot of stuff or if you are a taller person.  The snack bar's menu focused on Vietnamese fusion. We ordered Han's Marrow Beef, Tiger's Milk Ceviche and Mango Papaya Salad. The portions were great for sharing and delicious. Each dish was full of so much flavour. My favourite from the three were the Tiger's Milk Ceviche."}
{"text":"Great ceviche ..service was ok ..long wait so be prepared. Decor is great but I wouldn't go back as the food wasn't spectacular."}
{"text":"Food is awesome. You have to get the ceviche and if they have the chicken curry special that is a must as well. I can't eat spicy so the curry has a kick but not too much. Really, really good food and now one of my fav restos.  I will say service is a bit questionable - a bit slow with different tables getting the same dishes before other tables that ordered it first (my group split into two tables as we wanted to eat sooner than to sit down altogether) but besides that food has been great."}
{"text":"Sure, we had to wait 1.5 hours for a table (we just popped around the corner to Birreria Volo and sampled excellent beers in the meantime) but it was worth it: this is definitely one of the coolest spots I've been to in awhile...housed in what looks more like a house than a commercial establishment, the exterior is so unassuming, most people probably pass right by without noticing it. But inside you're a world away. The space has cool lighting, decorative lanterns and lots of hanging tinsel, and just has a super cool, fun, cozy feel to it. True, it may be cramped in parts, but overall it has a unique, special atmosphere.  I had to try a Foco Loco, which is a can of tropical fruit juice (I went for passionfruit) overturned into a mason jar of booze (rum I think) and muddled herbs. It was light and refreshing. But I couldn't help but notice other people drinking (what I later learned was) boozy long island-style iced tea served in little tea pots, topped with bottled coke. Gotta try that next time for sure.  As for the food, everything we ate was phenomenal: the Tiger's Milk Ceviche, prepared with a spicy curry-like sauce (as opposed to standard citrus-style ceviche); the Marrow Beef, prepared with a soy-marrow dressing and served on the marrow bone itself; and an amazing French dip-style roast beef sandwich with a side of addictive gravy for dipping.  Amazing top to bottom!"}
{"text":"I had pretty low expectations for the food at Pinky's. I lived in China for 16 years and have come to associate hipster decor with bad food. Everything was super spot on. For 125$ for three ppl, two drinks and not a lot of food it is most certainly not a deal. Go to Pho Hung is you want amazing Vietnamese food at great prices, but if you want to eat some banging Viet food at a bar, maybe if you're going on a date or eating with fancy ppl then it's awesome. Order to share; grab a Sammie or Bahn Mi somewhere else before if you're hungry. Guava juice can in a cocktail is killer. I'm gonna copy that at home for a fraction of the price."}
{"text":"I really liked this place - I came here on a Saturday night for a drink with another person. They don't lie when they say it's unassuming, there isn't a sign and it's in a converted house so I'm sure I would have walked past if I didn't know what I was looking for. We got here at 6:30 and it was already bustling, we got some seats on the bar area up front and ordered cocktails.   I had the mango foco loco which was delicious and I think the best bang for your buck on the drinks menu, it's pretty big and very refreshing. My companion had the pink lady which is gin based and was by all accounts, delicious.   We didn't partake in any of the food, but everything looked and smelled delicious, especially the marrow beef so I'd love to go back and give that a try !"}
{"text":"Pinky's Ca Phe is one of the places where you can say: give us one of everything on the menu! Indeed, every item on the menu was absolutely delicious! The portion is relatively small for each dish. It's like tapas style. Therefore if you're going with 4 people, it's worth it to try everything on the menu.   The restaurant is located inside a house without a sign, and no phone number for reservations. It's better to go during weekday nights with a smaller group to get seated easier. :)   A couple of my favorites: Tiger's milk ceviche: it tastes like ceviche in Tom yum soup! Eggplant: it was a special of the day. The eggplant soaked up all the sauce and was absolutely delicious! Grill platter: it's a good way to try everything. Their grilled meat is a must have!"}
{"text":"When people ask me what my favourite restaurant in Toronto is, without hesitation I tell them it's Pinky's. It's everything that's good about Toronto's dining scene - casual, fun, embraces the diversity of the city and feels like a hidden gem.   Walking into Pinky's is like walking into the best-catered house party you've never been invited to.   It's loud and dark, the service is great - the staff are always there when you need another teapot full of cocktails - but never obtrusive. It's cool without being pretentious and most importantly, the food is phenomenally tasty.   The Banh Xeo broccoli is the item here that I keep coming back for. The lightly battered broccoli - with a crust that shatters in an addictive way - has the dual winning traits of being fried and feeling slightly righteous (because broccoli). The Tiger's Milk ceviche, wings, and fried rice with soft shell crab are also fantastic.   Long story short: Go to Pinky's. Eat well, drink cocktails, leave smiling. Repeat."}
{"text":"Low-height old school diner stools secured to the floor and seemingly endless amounts of Asian themed trinkets and fixtures decorate abound the dimly-lit old house, fascinating every moment. This place is cool, you'll know it right away.  It manages to feel like multiple generations have had a hand in building the space, so it's hard to believe the Ca Phe has only been open a few weeks. I felt totally transported spending an evening there.  The menu is inspired Vietnamese with a modern finish. In every dish the common thread is the traditional Vietnamese flavours like lemon grass, fish sauce, chili, coriander and beef, all presenting themselves as deep, well developed and powerful, bursting into your mouth, just screaming \"Hey, you! Ya you! I'm f'ing Shrimp Paste. Do you TASTE me? HUH?!\". This food is very special, and I'm glad I got to have it, specific menu recommendations are unnecessary, just order it all.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Vibe/scene: Lots of thigh tattoos and high-waisted denim. Take it or leave it, folks.  Service: Not bad at all. No attitude, proper breakdown of the dishes/drinks, etc.  Drinks: Saigon Rock was crisp and refreshing. Hua-Hua Ice Tea that I shared with my friend was smooth but also boozy AF, so watch your intake of this thing.   Food: Tiger's Milk ceviche is tasty and refreshing. Marrow beef was inventively plated and the flavors were on point. My friend and I shared the meat platter (chicken legs, pork jowl, beef short ribs), and the standout of the trio would have to the pork jowl (especially when you pair it with the pungent chili sauce). Chicken legs and short ribs were also tasty but nothing to write home about. Loved the addition of daikon radish and carrot ribbons.   Bill: Unsurprisingly steep but not outrageous.   All in all I liked my time at Pinky's. The kitschy, tropical interior space really adds to the dining experience, and I have to say that the way Vietnamese food is \"reimagined\" here feels slightly more successful than the way Japanese fare is served up over at Hanmoto."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible staff. Tried to force 6 ppl into a four person table. Had no concern for our comfort. They didn't care, staff was rude and wanted us to sit on old rusty metal baskets for chairs. Not happening. Walked out. Horrible. Absolutely horrible. Never going there again."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food. Ridiculously tiny portions. $$$ for sure."}
{"text":"Food: The Tiger's Milk Ceviche was one of the best ceviches I've ever had. I would come back just for this and this is the main reason I'm giving this place 5 stars. I also assume that there are a few other items which I haven't tried on the menu that are amazing as well. I had the fried broccoli and wasn't a huge fan, but my friends liked it so it might have just been my taste (I wasn't super into it being battered).   Drinks: Strong and tasty  Atmosphere: The place itself is small and cozy. Lots of ambient lighting and small tables. If you're going at a busy time it's going to be tough to get a table. I've only gotten a spot once and it was because we arrived right when it opened"}
{"text":"Kitschy, cute, and fun! Located near Queen Street W and Bathurst Street, this is a really casual spot that's great for small groups and dates. Space is definitely limited, ambiance is lively but dim. Super laid-back, but still with a sense of vibrancy. Service might be a little slow, but they're accommodating and friendly when they're around.   The food itself is fusion Vietnamese goodness. This isn't your usual Pho Mi or Golden Turtle experience - far, far, from. It's hip but zany (you can tell from the dim but colourful lights), and the menu reflects that very same attitude. It's Vietnamese food with a twist.   Since we weren't too hungry when we visited, we ordered: a) the \"So Fly\" fried rice (which has a myriad of ingredients I wouldn't be able to list - the same reaction I had when I saw how many ingredient's Lee's Singaporean Slaw had!), b) the Lac-Lac Beef Ribs Platter. Overall, delicious flavours. The rice had some crunch and a great texture - it isn't very spicy, and actually had a nice sweetness and saltiness to it. The beef ribs had nice flavourful, but could have been more tender.  Overall, a really charming spot. The food was generally delicious, and we'd love to come back and try other items from their quirky menu. For two items, we paid over $35."}
{"text":"I've been here several times. A couple times I was lucky and only had to wait 30 ish minutes, once I went near by and grabbed a drink while I waited for  45 mins, two other times the wait time was over an hour and we gave up.   Every time I've eaten here, the servers are helpful and friendly and the food has been fantastic. The Ceviche and eggplant are my favourites. I suggest filling up on the mains - the yam dessert wasn't my cup of tea.   For two people, it comes up to about $100... which is quite pricey for what you get so I probably can't come here as often as I'd like."}
{"text":"I had so much fun tonight!  @pinkys_caphe cocktail bar and restaurant is one of Toronto's best. As I walked through the front door I was transported from the sounds of the city to a cool and swanky oasis filled with charcoal grilled meats, fruity cocktails, melt-in-your-mouth ceviche, clay pot curries, dimmed lights, jazzy music and the hippest, funkiest decor one could dream up.  Located in the downstairs of an old house, the bared clapboard walls and colourful stained glass windows show its age, and a repurposed marble bar is the perfect place to keep your drink cool. The patio out back, that's where the charcoal magic happens  I loved it. ALL of it. The food, the decor, the service, the guy sitting next to meI walked in smiling and I walked out smiling even bigger.  I would have added pics of the amazing food, (Ceviche, Pho Baguette, Mango Papaya Salad) but the swanky lights didn't provide the best lighting... just a reason to go taste for yourself."}
{"text":"One of the coolest places I visited in Toronto. We got there on a Saturday night around 8 or 9pm and the wait was about an hour. That's a bit long, but trust me the wait is worth it. We got ceviche, mango salad, fried rice, pho beef dip. Everything was excellent and unexpected. There's so much layering of textures and flavors--I suppose Viet cuisine is pretty good at that, but this place does it so well. Plus, it's not in a suffocating environment. Perfect late night spot for drinks and tapas with friends--just expect a wait (for good reason)."}
{"text":"The most awful service that I've had in this city. The food wasn't that great and way too overpriced . And the server refused to split our bill and asked us do the math. That was after they charged us 20% gratuity for being a group of 6"}
{"text":"Pinky's is a unique space. It's setup in a residential home converted into a 50's diner-esque decor, serving upscale Vietnamese inspired dishes.  The Tiger's Milk Ceviche is a must have...! I would also highly recommend the Mango-Papaya salad w/ Squid.  We also tried the beef fresh spring roll served on bone marrow. It was pretty good, but it was over-shadowed but the other items on the table...  I will most likely be going back to Pinky's in the near future..."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to hang out with a few friends, grab some drinks, and get some delicious bites. It's located off the main road and in a house, don't be shy to push open the garden gate and step right in. This place is very cozy with seats and table packed tightly. My three friends and I were seated in the front part of the house, separate from the main bar/dining area. The seats right beside the window was on top of the radiator and let's just say there were some very toasty buns by the end of the meal.  I ordered a mango foco loco which was a rum drink with a can of mango juice balanced upside down. It's a refreshing and delicious cocktail. Despite the waitress's advice to not lift the can till more than half the drink is finished, I decided to try my luck close to that half way point and ended up with one napkin worth of mango juice overflow situation.   I had really high expectation for the food going in from all the wonderful reviews, and this place does not disappoint. The tiger's milk ceviche was everyone's favourite. I really liked the mango and papaya salad with squid, and the marrow beef. The marrow was not what I expected, it was beef rolled up with different herbs inside, all balanced on top of a piece of bone, and was the most memorable dish. The sticky wings and beef curry clay pot were perfectly prepared, and full of flavors. With the so fly rice, every bite was different, one bite would have bits of fried softshell crab, while another would have a burst of the ocean with the salmon roe. Great if you're a fan of that seafood taste, but for me, it wasn't my favourite out of all the dishes.    Overall, this was a great food experience, but the space is very crammed and heated seats are only really enjoyable in cold cars."}
{"text":"I have conflicting thoughts on Pinky's: I love the idea of a Vietnamese-Cambodian restaurant, run by two Koreans. That this exists in Toronto is a testament to its diversity and willingness to cross cultural lines.   The vibe was also very cool, and the place filled up quickly. Even the food was solid (shocking, I know!) - if pricey and uneven.  While I can certainly say that it was worth the night out, food items such as the Tiger's Milk Ceviche and Sticky Wings were hilariously underwhelming and overpriced.   That said, the Pho Beef Dip and Marrow Beef were worth the price of admission - largely because they stood out as unique and clever creations.   Made with a concentrated pho broth - meaty and salty in all the right ways, and held together in a lightly toasted bun, the Pho Beef Dip was marvelous, and by far the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"Another excellent restaurant by Leemo Han!   I usually stay away from fusion cuisine as it could lead to fusion-confusion, however as long as it's Leemo Han, you know you are in good hands.   Similarly to Hanmoto and OddSeoul, the restaurant have a speakeasy vibe and it's quite difficult to locate. However once you found it, you will be automatically transported to an old school, Southern Vietnamese vibe restaurant :).   I have been here a couple of times already, and I strongly recommend to go with a party of 2 or max of 4. The more people there are, the harder it is to get a seat as they do not take reservation, tables are first come first serve. Below are my fav dishes with a mini review (no pictures for now cuz I ain't letting Yelp steal my pic again lol):   - Marrow Beef: I love love this dish. It's similar to Bo Tai Chanh (beef marinated in lime). Very flavorful with a slight kick from the red chilies.  -Banh Xe Broccoli: Broccoli tempura with the banh xeo batter. It's quite good and the batter isn't too thick.  -Tiger's Milk ceviche: nicely flavored with huge chunks of shrimp :) -Pho Beef dip-you-dip: the dish is served with a small bowl of pho broth and you are supposed to dip the viet sub into the broth - not my fav dish. I didn't think the broth was flavorful and the viet sub wasn't marinated enough either. Also, it was quite messy to dip the viet sub into the bowl.  -BBQ platter (Chicken legs, luc lak beef, pork jowl): fall-off the bone tender meat, juicy and flavorful. I licked the plate clean.  -Purple Yam dessert with coconut milk sorbet, on a bed of purple mints (tia to): GET IT IF U CAN. I'm not a dessert person and I loved this dessert, it was quite possibly one of the best I have ever had in Toronto. If you prefer a somewhat savoury dessert, you will like it. Be warned though, the purple mint is an acquired taste, you might not like it.  -Golden Curry (special of the day): I thought the curry was too thick for my liking, but it was still good!"}
{"text":"Another great addition by Leemo.  He's planning on opening another restaurant very soon (a Korean steakhouse), so get your Viet fix in because his focus shifts exclusively to that.  The food is as in his other restaurants, inventive, playful and cheap. The cocktails are interesting and expensive.  The space at Pinky's is the most fun out of all his restaurants. You literally feel like you're in an 70's/80's Korean mum's home.  This time round, the bathroom does not also serve as a dry storage, so spread your wings.   Note: Absolutely no substitutions, even for nut allergies. So it is something to keep in mind."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place because I enjoyed Hanmoto however I was disappointed to say the least. When I first got there the front area was empty so they were able to seat us right away, they seated us in the corner (it kind of felt like we were sitting at a bar but there was hardly any room to move around). We took it upon ourselves to move over a little so we would have more room but the servers quickly came over and told us we can't take up the middle seats because it will be filled. Which is fine, I completely understand but it could've been said a lot nicer and with less condescension. I just want to say customer service is really important to me so I was really thrown off by the servers being unpleasant which is why I decided to cut my order in half - I just wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible.  Okay now onto the food: 3-5 Stars. If you're a fan of fish sauce you will most likely like it here because almost everything we ordered had a side of fish sauce. We ordered the papaya salad, broccoli and soft shell crab fried rice (and something else but I can't remember what) which were all good.. nothing special to be honest.    It was nice to try it but between the service which I must say got better about halfway through being there and the food, I most likely won't go back. I also just want to add that the two seats beside us weren't filled by the end of our meal."}
{"text":"The thing that stands out the most about this place is the decor. If you are looking for a intimate dining spot that looks like a roadside shack in Southeast Asia, I think this is your best bet.   The food is generally good but could be over seasoned sometimes, but that really doesn't take about from it's charm and innovative menu"}
{"text":"Banh mi is incredible. I'd say the best in town.  So cheap for the quality. You have to try it. Everything about it feels like a Toronto secret. Hidden at Clinton and College in what looks a house is a place you're destined to become obsessed with. The drinks are perfectly designed ambrosia. Food is cheap, plentiful and worth ordering one of everything. The serving staff goes out of their way to make you feel at home. Perfectly designed for first dates and anniversaries where you want to blow minds but not your whole pay checks. Come here as soon as you can."}
{"text":"Still thinking about that Tiger Milk Ceviche! Never had nothing like it and the taro chips are a nice ode to southern Asia. Also a big fan of any grilled/bbq meats they're serving up. The glaze they put on their meats invites robust charred flavour finished with a sweet tang! Though the most memorable part of Pinky, is the atmosphere - it feels the most authentic and spacious of all the restaurants in this group - keep an eye out for the finer details that give you a glimpse of vietnamese swagger in the 60/70s. Keep up the great work :)"}
{"text":"Terrible service. They charged a 20% gratuity and refused to do the math on our individual bills. Servers acted as if they were reluctant to give us any decent service. Food was good but overpriced. I would not return or recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"By far the best dining experience in a long time for me! Every dish that we ordered was consistently delicious and the flavours went really well together. Definitely a party in my mouth    The decor of this place is so extra that it works...tinsels and pink lights everywhere! Definitely gives out school old vibes. I think most people would describe this place as \"hispter.\" Even though it is a Viet-inspired place, not a lot of Asians (on the particular night that I went), and it had a slight hint of Viet cuisines - I know because I am Vietnamese.  Nice place for family-style dining where you share food, although the portions could be a bit more. Considering the sizes, the prices here are above average. My friends and I went here for dinner and the bill came up to $124 for 3 people including 3 drinks, and 4 dishes (mango papaya salad - tiger ceviche - so fly rice - pork jowl)  We each got their version of a mojito - guava, mango, and lychee - each drinks comes with a can of juice (specific to the flavour you pick); and my favourite has got to be lychee!  Mango papaya salad - the best mango-papaya salad by far! It comes with grilled octopus pieces. Strong peanuts flavour but you can also taste the acidity and it's balanced out with the savoury flavour (maybe fish sauce) and a hint of sesame oil.  Tiger's milk ceviche - their version of \"ceviche\" where the ingredients (tuna, octupus, avocado, fish roe) are bathe in a bowl of coconut milk which gives a rich, creamy flavour. Has a nice kick from the jalapeno pieces. Comes with taro chips (not enough)   So-fly rice - I like the fact that the server mixes the rice at the table for you. The name is an accurate depiction of this dish - nothing like the normal fried rice I've had. There are veggies but the lettuce pieces give it a fresh taste because they're not normally found in fried rice. Crabs and fish roe are parts of the ingredients  Pork jowl - heaven on a plate!!! Served with 3 big pieces of lettuce which you use to roll. The pork pieces are so tender and juicy and fatty - I'm drooling just thinking about the food. You make your own roll, combining the acidity from the pickled carrots and the fresh lime with the fatty and ginger-ry flavour of the pork, and they all get dipped in a sweet & sour sauce. Nice ending to a meal  HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place!!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed this dining experience- from the location to the unique decor and of course, the flavourful dishes. We ordered the Mango salad, the Tiger Ceviche, the Marrow Beef and the So Fly! Rice. The rice was good but unremarkable - it was actually underwhelming but the other 3 dishes were excellent. The Taro chips served with the ceviche are a welcome change to Tortilla chips. The grilled squid in the mango salad seems ill suited but is actually the perfect complement to the rest of the dish and the marrow beef plate had 5 maki-like rolls of thinly sliced beef which exploded with flavour. Each bite was a refreshing burst of lime, onion and cilantro. I would definitely go back and order any one of these 3 dishes again."}
{"text":"One line description: A very laidback unique vietnamese fusion food experience.  My friend and I went here on a friday evening around 6:45 pm which is right before the rush hour time of 7-8 pm. Thankfully we didn't have to wait to be seated.   We ordered the Tiger Milk Ceviche, which was excellent. We just had to order it after reading all these rave reviews about it. I'd rate it a solid 9/10. I mean who doesn't like a dish with coconut milk and taro chips?. We also ordered the \"So Fly!\" Rice. It was also really good - the flavors and textures were well executed. I'd rate it 8/10. I had the \"Foco Loco\" Lychee flavor drink which was pretty good too (7/10).  Overall, this place has a very laidback vibe. The lights are dim, music not too loud, and an eye-catching decor. This also means that your food may take longer than usual to be served. So if you're looking for a quick bite you might want to go somewhere else. It's also a bit pricey for the portion size that's served. That being said, I'd definitely recommend it if you're looking for a unique food experience in the Little Italy area."}
{"text":"My first exposure to Leemo Han's style of fusion. The place is a bit of a dingy space that resembles an old Vietnamese bar, with a definite sense of being transported to a different time and place. The exterior equally intriguing and curious is unmarked and can mainly be verified by either customers exiting or their DineSafe signage. I would say their ceviche and their softshell crab fried rice are must orders. Food here is exciting and possesses recurring common flavour profiles that have an unmistakably Southeast Asian flair. This place is both a hole in the wall and a restaurant I would not hesitate to recommend to others as something representative of the very best instances of culinary marriages/fusions Toronto can offer."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place! I came during the week and luckily grabbed a table right away but this extremely rare so plan to wait. We ordered the tiger milk ceviche which is a must. We also got the platter which has chicken legs, beef short ribs, and pork jowl. The beef short ribs were my favourite however next time I'd skip the chicken legs because they were pretty basic. And we also got the so fly rice which was a favourite. I highly recommend all the dishes I got except for the chicken legs and next time I want to try the broccoli. For dessert we had the purple yam which wasn't for me but I'm not a big yam person. It had interesting flavour but I prefer sweet desserts. The inside of this restaurant is very cool to as it is in an old converted house. Will go back for sure"}
{"text":"I haven't been doing too many reviews lately, but this absolutely delicious place motivated me to share :)  It's just a house, next door to cafe diplomatico ... But converted into a quaint and cozy place.  With their Philly roots, I was expecting the beef deep bahn mi to be the signature dish, but hands down the lemongrass chicken and other freaky chicken dishes were the best.  The so fly rice was way better than anticipated and just a slight chilli spice.  Lastly, the coconut ice cream on yam with more nuts and textured goodness mixed in than I could identify made me happy I ordered dessert.  The compliment i can also give to this restaurant was simply the vibe.  No rush.  One dish snack n share at a time.  You can feel that good people own and run this place.  Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Pinky's Ca Phe is a fun and interesting restaurant to hang out with friends and have some drinks and good food! Love the speak easy vibe and the set up is homey and cozy.  Warning: make sure you let your waiter knows about any food allergies. Not the kitchen would not accommodate you but at least you know which dish or drinks or desserts you cannot order. If you do have nut allergy, your choice of food would be quite limited.   We ordered a few items to share and love the flavours which was bold and interesting.  We asked for some Sriracha sauce, the waiter said there would be a charge? Then came back saying there won't be a charge?? I have yet been to a restaurant that charge for Sriracha sauce from a bottle...    I would probably go back for a snack next time when I am in the area. Either come alone or with a group of no more than 4 then you won't need to wait for a table for so long."}
{"text":"I went to this place last night with a friend. We arrived just before the doors opened at 6pm. By the time the place opened, there was a line up outside. The dining room filled up by about 630pm. If you want to dine at this place, it is best to arrive early.  The food was fantastic, with lots of bold and fresh flavours.  The menu is made up of about a dozen or so shareable plates. We ordered half the menu and every dish we had was impressive.  My personal favourites were the ceviche and the grilled meat platter.  The cocktail list includes a variety of in house concoctions - the ones I tried were quite tasty.  The service was great.  I would have given this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that there is no AC and the place was screaming hot last night.  I would go back again in a heartbeat, though perhaps not in the summer..."}
{"text":"Walking into this place felt like being transported back into a viet street joint in Hanoi. The tassels and the wall decor instantly brought me down memory lane of my recent trip to Vietnam. The lighting is dim and moody, with retro bar seating towards the back and small tables to the front of the restaurant. The place itself is situated in an house on Clinton street, with no signage outside. If you didn't know what you're looking for, you'd walk right past this place.   All else aside, the food they serve here is amazing!! The menu houses a small selection of food; theres about 10-12 things on the menu. But the portions are fair and perfect for sharing. We ordered mango squid salad, the ceviche, beef marrow, and the fly rice. Normally I would have a favourite to recommend, but I cant...they're all a must!! I loved everything we ordered and each dish they brought up was unique and mouthwatering good. Such an amazing combination of sweet, sour, crispy, and smoky. Unfortunately we didn't get a chance to try their drinks, so we'll definitely be back for a round 2!   Highly recommend. Peanut allergy eaters beware though, they use peanuts in almost every dish."}
{"text":"What to try?  The tigers milk ceviche.   I thought the tigers milk ceviche was the best on the menu. They made surf clam taste great with the sauce and the taro chips. In addition of the surf clam, there's bits of yellow fin tuna scallops too so I'm sure it's one of the popular dishes at this restaurant.   We also ordered the short ribs special. I thought it was overpriced for what you get. Similar to Korean short ribs, they are grilled and served with sour carrots and radish, some lettuce and some ginger green onion garnish. It was a mix of sour sauce with the ribs and I thought for the price I'm paying, it doesn't justify the amount I get. It wasn't made specifically with some expensive ingredients as well so I thought I overpaid that dish.   We also ordered the beef marrow dish. Not knowing what to expect, we were surprised with what we received. Instead of the typical bone marrow, the dish was actually beef slices wrapped with some Vietnamese leaves lying on top of a huge hollowed out bone with black vinegar on the bottom. Didn't really taste much of the bone marrow I'd say though.   I do really like the decor though. It does give you a cozy feeling and going to a 90s Vietnamese restaurant. It's in a discrete house that doesn't look flashy at all and unless you're a local or you are brought here by a friend who knows the place, it's hard for you to spot the restaurant!   Last tip?  Be prepared to wait in line because there's no reservations. If you are feeling adventurous in terms of drinks, try their foco loco where it's a tropical drink mixed with spirits and herbs. The presentation of this drink is actually pretty unique!"}
{"text":"It's tucked away, but if you look for a red neon sign in a ram-shackled house, you'll know that you've just stumbled onto Pinky's.   This cozy spot is a pretty dazzling mix of kitsch meets cool. Once your eyes adjust to the dark you'll get a kick out of the dollar store streamers, strings of red lantern lights, floral accents, and eye-catching mementos. It also makes you wonder if you've instantly time traveled to a past Vietnam that's a bit more raucous, a bit more fun. But the music is strictly present day hip hop.   They don't take reservations so be prepared to wait. Even in the middle of a snow storm on a Friday night the place was packed but luckily we eventually managed to nab some seats at the bar.   We started off with some Foco Locos (your choice of juice, mixed with herbs and rum) before diving into the menu. Everything sounded ridiculously good but we narrowed it down to our final five.    The Tiger's Milk Ceviche was really nice and fresh. Good acidity from the lime. The tree nuts gave the dish some added texture along with the taro chips. Not spicy at all surprisingly, despite the peppers which suited my taste perfectly.    Next was the bone marrow. I've never had bone marrow like this before! They almost looked like sushi rolls. But instead of rice in seaweed there was an array of veggies drenched in fish sauce wrapped with thinly sliced beef.   The Mango Papaya Salad with grilled octopus was also a great dish. Very light and refreshing. The meat was really tender as well.   All of these starters were a great way to prep our palate for the So Fly! Rice. I've had fried rice many times but never with soft shell crab and fish roe. This is an excellent dish. Not only is it flavorful but it's so well balanced. You get the sweetness and the crunch of the crab meat mixed in with rice and fish sauce and as you begin to chew, fish roes are exploding in your mouth. It's the ultimate flavor bomb. The only thing that would have made it even better would be a runny egg that you could break and mix with the rice.   The last dish we got was the Mushroom Vermicelli. I was really excited for this since I love mushrooms and this dish boasts that it includes five kinds. But I was a bit disappointed that there weren't many in the actual dish, it was mostly vermicelli and oyster mushroom sauce. This dish was good but after a while the intensity of the mushroom sauce makes it difficult to eat by itself. The noodles tasted a bit al dente (might have been buckwheat noodle instead of regular rice vermicelli which would have gone soggy fast).   I would highly recommend this place though! It has such a nice vibe and the food is excellent."}
