{"text":"Not the best atmosphere. Way too bright to drink and have fun. No other customers were around when we entered. 
There are not enough items on the menu. Side dishes are mediocre. The gopchang was alright but could have been better. I wouldn't pay 15 dollars for this."}

Jang Goon Gop Chang opened couple months ago near Yonge and Steeles and I've been meaning to check it out for awhile. I finally made it over last month for dinner with a friend to find the restaurant pretty empty. The restaurant itself has around 7 tables so once it gets busy, you will have to wait quiet a bit. Good thing we went a little early because as soon as we sat down, groups of people started to pour in and the restaurant was full in no time.

Jang Goon specializes in Korean BBQ, but hold up... it's a special kind of Korean BBQ- not the short ribs or BulGoGi you are thinking of.. they specialize in intestine BBQ! Those of you who are not familar, GopChang means intestine in Korean and believe me or not, it is so tasty when bbq'd!

Jang Goon mainly sells GopChang (Cow's small intestine) and MakChang (Cow's abdomen) which are minimum 2 order per table.

My friend and I decided to order GopChang since that's what they specialize in.

GopChang is $15 per order and served with chives and bean sprouts on top.

It arrives pre-cooked on a grill but I like to give it a little more heat so that it becomes crunchy on the outside.

You can dip it into different types of sauce they give you or eat it with chives that are served on the side.

After you are done with GopChang, you can order some rice so that they cook it for you on the same grill.

We ordered 1 rice which is $2.50 and they add some seaweed, spicy sauce and sesame oil to make the fried rice for you.

Summary: Overall I enjoyed my meal at Jang Goon, the restaurant is clean and it's always nice to go to a restaurant where they specialize in specific dish versus where they have 2000 X things on the menu.
My another go-to spot for intestine used to be Piggy's but I was told they don't serve it anymore. If you haven't tried intestine bbq and would like to, give Jang Goon a try! (if you are brave enough that is)"}
{"text":"Not your typical Korean restaurant! me and my friend had dinner at Jang Goon Gobb Chang yesterday and we couldnt be more satisfied! Many dishes on the menu  can't be found in other places in Toronto (gobb chang, sam bap, al-tang, etc.). Everything tasted very delicious - even the side dishes! Their potato pancake was extraordinary, gobb chang was fresh and flavourful, al-tang (fish roe stew) was perfectly cooked! Restaurant was small with good vibe - a great place for gathering and soju!"}
{"text":"I come here for one thing only: their cold noodle. They have the best cold noodle hands down! 

1) They have the arrowroot noodles as opposed to the other kind whose English name escapes me. The noodle is chewy just the way I like it. For those who are unfamiliar with cold noodles, you can cut the noodles with the scissors provided. 

2) Their prices are the best! $6.95. You can also pay more to combo with kalbi or dumplings.

3) Their soup is ice cold since they put ice in the soup! Perfect for the summer! Their soup base also tastes the best out of all the places I've tried. It's so refreshing.

The downfall of this restaurant has nothing to do with their food. It's the location and the simple fact that cold noodles is not a dish everyone likes. Western peoples like meat. They are also not used to eating cold meals. Cold noodles lacks meat (except for a slice of pork), is cold, and not everyone will like the texture. The soup doesn't have that savory taste like pho. I've been here maybe 10 times and every time there are only Koreans. Which is a shame because I think cold noodles is a wonderful dish. It's healthy and refreshing as opposed to many other foods that make you feel tired and greasy afterwards. 

Parking here can get dicey. If you're making a left turn on Yonge street during busy hours, good luck. There are not many parking spots and perhaps you shouldn't even try to park here. It's pretty narrow. Just park across at the Tim Horton plaza and cross the road.

This place had closed for a few months and recently reopened. I was so excited and went to get my cold noodle fix as soon as they reopened. I recommend this restaurant to everyone, especially if you want to experience real Korean food. Korean food is about so much more than just bibimbap and bbq."}
{"text":"Stopped in while I was getting my phone fixed next door. I ordered the bulgogi and it was ready (and FRESH! mm mm) in under ten minutes. Despite being the only non native customer in the joint and my waitress  (I'd wager) not speaking a stitch of English above basic nouns, I got plenty of attention and the wait staff was all very sweet. 

Ill definitely be back, there's a lot on the menu that looks worth trying and I want to give that five beers deal a go!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on a weekday, and it was about half full. Clean atmosphere,  but very limited parking space (2-3). 

We ordered grilled intestine combo (what they're known for) which includes the meat itself, egg soup, fried rice (which gets mixed with meat near the end), and a choice of 6 beers or soju. Since I'm not a big fan of soju (shame on me), we substituted for makguli (rice wine) for extra few bucks. They also  gave us a big bowl of dwen-jang-gook (korean miso soup) on the house, which was a nice gesture!! This combo was about 45 dollars. 

Service was fast, and our waitress was very friendly and attentive. Another lady came out to grill the meat for us, and came back several times to check up on the meat.
At the end of the meal, a gentleman who seemed like the owner approached our table to ask how the meal was, and if it was pleasant.

The meal was delicious, and we left being full and happy :) I would most likely come back and try their Intestine stew! (I know it sounds gross but don't judge too quick until you've tried it! Recommended!)"}
{"text":"Summer is here, so is Korean Cold Noodle Season... 

Walking by \"No English Name\" Korean restaurant a few times seeing the huge photo of this icy noodle... finally brings me to Yoo Ga Ne...

I asked my Yelp friend to order whatever while I try parking my car... (yes they do have 2 spaces right in front of the restaurant..but the last thing for me to do is trying to back out to Yonge Street during rush hour??

I ended up with 2 dishes that are HOT VS COLD...

Chick Hae Naeung Myun - Cold Arrowroot Noodle, Aging Skate Fish with Spicy Sauce ($10.95)
- I found the noodle here a little mushy... 
- Skate Fish... raw and fermented and aged in hot sauce... a little too slimy for me...and for some consider one of the most stinky food...
- I secretly fed them all to my Yelp friend.......................... while I ate most of the noodle and the mini egg.....

Soon Dae Gook - Pork Soup Mixed with Sliced Soon Dae Sausage ($7.95)
- You must seriously love pork to enjoy this: skin, fat, kidney, liver, stomach...all the pig you can think of and more is in this soup...
- The taste is strong.. and heavy... and definitely comforting on a cold winter night...

Seems like there are some noodle specials.... but all in Korean.... I will have to ask next time when I come back for some more cold noodle!!

Portion is huge... as I am still feel full in the evening.... Must be the pork!!!"}
