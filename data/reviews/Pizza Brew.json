{"text":"Service was awful.  Waited 40 minutes after ordering to get our food.  No communications with us at all regarding the order.  Had to actually look for someone to determine what the issue was.  Do not recommend if time is a premium.  Used to recommend this place but after the service just received and cannot honestly say that I will continue to recommend"}
{"text":"Fat Cat pizza was really good. And brewery tour was really fun. Great prices in gift shop and really cheap yummy beer"}
{"text":"I found this place to have really horrible tasting pizza. The sauce had a really weird taste to it, like it's definitely not an Italian pizza sauce. Topping tasted like poor quality canned stuff. The pizza has cornmeal on the crust which made for a salty, granular texture.One of my worst pizza experiences! The beer tasted \"raw & unfinished\" , so overall it was a very crude experience."}
{"text":"This place is in the middle of a light industrial zone. Parking is not usually an issue but here's the awesome. Grab a copy of Neighbour's newspaper. You ger free pizza. Yes I said FREE. Alternatively you can go on the pizza brews website and print 2 for 1 coupons. Everyday. All the time.   The pizza is deadly good. They have subs,  sandwiches,  nachos. All kinds of goodies.   The beer is just meh. I find most of the selections have a sweet finish to them. I'm a fan of European style,  little more bitter. But hey,  to each their own....   BUT there is a new Brewmaster in charge,  he's been at his craft a good long time. He will make it better. Go Wolfgang!"}
{"text":"Located at the Minhas Micro Brewery is their pizza restaurant. They have a pretty sizeable and delicious sounding menu for such a small place. On top of pizzas they do sandwiches and appetizers. If you're here for the beer (duh!) you can try any of the 101 varieties that the company brews, which includes beers you can't normally buy at the liquor store and those that aren't sold in Calgary.  The tables are a cool design with the supports looking like piled and dented kegs. There are also a few large tables which can comfortably seat 10 people for a large group or if you need to cozy up to a stranger when its busy.   After partaking in the brewery tour I sat down to enjoy a pizza and let the beer soak in. I chose the Axe Head which comes with Spolumbo's sausage, pepperoni, salami, and a three cheese blend. It was really delicious. For $11 you get a good sized pie and they aren't cheap on the toppings. My pizza was really oily, which I love, but others may find a turn-off. Since I had enough beer during the tour I decided to wash everything down with a root beer ($3) with they also brew themselves along with flavoured cream sodas too.  If you're looking for a light lunch, the pizzas are a good size to share with someone else or to have leftovers for later. However, if you're hungry, you shouldn't have any problem finishing one yourself."}
{"text":"Delightful little pizza spot. Did the dealathon 4 beers/2pizzas for $20.00. Quiet laid back spot. Service was good. Pizza was awesome. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Pizza Brew is in Minhas Brewery in an industrial area.  We had a coupon from the Student Union Ticket Pak for a free pizza and it was recommended that we also use the 2 for 1 for the brewery tour.  We arrived before the tour time of 3:30 so came for a late lunch.  I approached the counter and asked about the coupon and was told I could use it for any of their pizzas.  I didn't realize each table had a menu so I looked at it at the front counter and we ordered the Fat Cat meat pizza (regular $15) and also a Chicken Caesar wrap ($8).  We took a seat and waited for our food to be called.  There are 3 long large tables with bench seating on each side.  There's also about 6-8 high tables with stools for to seat 2-4 people.  It wasn't too busy so there were a few of these tables unoccupied.  The 3 TVs are playing with Dragons' Den highlighting the Minhas on the show, and a screen highlighting their beers.  It was a 10-15 minute wait before they called my name and I went to pick up the pizza and wrap.  The pizza is fairly large and good for one hungry person or could be shared if ordering an appetizer.  I tried a slice of the pizza, and being a meat one, it wasn't too greasy and I liked the crust.  My chicken wrap was 2 large portions filled with chicken and lettuce.  I was full for the eats.    It's a casual place but one of the staff did check on us to see how everything was.  The people who take the orders also clear and clean the tables so it's not always done immediately after vacated but it's not left too long.  Thanks for the free pizza and good food."}
{"text":"It was the first time trying their sandwiches. My Ruben was quite burnt but I still enjoyed it.  Their black & tan onion rings are quite tasty and huge.  Best onion rings I've had in a long time.  The ambience borders on tacky but that's ok because it's not meant to be a fine dining spot.  The looping mountain crest commercials on the TV screens are annoying."}
