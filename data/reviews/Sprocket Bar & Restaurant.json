{"text":"Good selection of craft beer on tap. The blueberry Almanac has been my favorite so far. They don't go basic with their selection. The burgers are jaw dropping amazing"}
{"text":"How novel that Wholefoods has a full bar with food service and Happy Hour! Very reasonable prices and excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"This is such a cool spot to grab lunch! I recently went with a few clients after looking at some houses. I tried the vegan nachos and I was completely blown away by the amazing taste. The location also has a very trendy vibe and is perfect for any friends who want to get a healthy satisfying lunch in.  I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I'd start wheeling your way to Sprocket and order yourself some of those Cauliflower Nachos, STAT!  Yes, the full service restaurant that's located inside Whole Foods Market Henderson is finally open. Beer enthusiasts make your way here too! Local brewers are featured here.   First impressions.... Glancing at the menu stand in front ...wow..pricey!! A quick scan and my eye was immediately drawn to the 19$ for short rib entree? Inside a specialty grocery store? Well if you can afford to shop here, you can afford to eat here right? Thank goodness that's the only item that's spendy. Everything else is fairly priced.   They have a Happy Hour menu which consists of small selection of food and drinks for under $7 between 4-6pm. Some real steals too. Pint of the Day is five bucks, the cheese plate that I had was same price too, had a Yuzu marmalade with slices of Brie, Blue and Gruyere cheeses. Jackfruit Quesadillas I tried were really good too! This place is top on my list for Meatless Mondays!!  They have a feature daily special as well. IE Mondays 1/2 dz oysters and Pinot Grigio for $10. See posted photo for more.   Ambiance Seats 72 it says.  The dining area is clean, industrial lines. metal chain fits the theme of the name. My server told me that each WFM restaurant has a unique name. This location is reflected on our large bicycle community of cyclists, hence the name Sprocket after a bicycle sprocket! The logo is a bicycle sprocket. How cool is that?  Full service restaurant. So that means you'll have servers come take your order after the host seats you at a table.  Service was great! Real helpful. Everyone from the manager, chef and Sprocket crew came by to check on me.  Chef came out to answer a question I had with the Yuzu marmalade.  Restaurant is family friendly, there are several TV airing sports above the bar counter.  Limited hours... 11 to 9pm   Excited that there are even more healthier alternatives opened up here! Good job Sprocket!"}
{"text":"Seriously disappointed. Bookmarked this spot while looking forward to great vegan options. WF emphasizes quality and I figured their restaurant would, too. Sure didn't seem like it from my visit, though. Note that the menu is seasonal, so don't get your heart set on any one dish. Their current HH menu no longer has any vegan items at all, which had been a big part of why I went there.  Opted for vegan sushi rolls. Each \"roll\" is actually a 4-piece half roll ($5-7), and somehow mine took over 20 minutes to come out. For what amounts to a single roll. No explanation was given, plating was sloppy with smeared sauces, and the food wasn't very good. Oh, and the \"dinner rush\" at the time consisted of exactly four people, all of whom were already served.   Based on this experience, I wouldn't return. I can find better rolls ready-made in the refrigerator case 100 yards away. Grab your own meal at the hot foods area and just use this \"restaurant\" for seating."}
{"text":"I love this bar. Located at whole foods market, it has tons of great vegan options. The cauliflower nachos are the best!! Go try it if you haven't!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they first opened last year (or was it the year before??). My review is based on all my visits... Sprocket is a great meal option when you want good quality food in a cafe/lounge w alcohol type setting (without having to spend the time or have to dress up for a full on restaurant).  They have a range of items on the menu from sides to salads,flatbreads, burgers, nachos, sushi, etc.  What I like is that the vegan options are all a hit taste -wise. I've tried all the vegan items and they're all good. I often go for the Thursday special when I get the vegan beyond burger and a beer for $10!  Service is okay, there are a few good ones and a few meh ones.  But this experience is mainly for a quick casual meal that is good quality food that's priced fairly.  And-the bonus is that you can do some shopping in Whole Foods before/after your meal."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place. I've always been a Whole Foods fan so when they started placing bar/restaurants in their stores I thought it was a win win. I've eaten here on at least 6 different occasions for lunch and dinner, the first time was great! Great food, great service and an interesting mix of craft brews. Each time thereafter something has been off. Either they are out of beer, the line isn't working, they are of the Gouda dip (which is amazing), the fish was soggy, the service was lacking, etc. Maybe they are still trying to get into the swing of things, but there has been no consistency in past few months. The food is very good, I was delightfully surprised at the vegan rolls, amazing. Unfortunately I won't be back. I have given it too many tries coupled with constant fails. Sorry guys, I really did try."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out on my day off for lunch. Sprocket is located inside whole foods, near the bakery. You can buy food in the hot food area and bring it in after you pay, or order from the restaurant. There are lots of beers on tap, including some from Modern Times Brewing! Good selection of wines too. In addition to happy hour M-F 4-6pm, there are daily specials.   Staff is friendly and food is tasty! I tried the cauliflower vegan nachos ($7, $5 on happy hour) and green chile braised short rib ($19). The nachos were very unique and flavorful. The cauliflower had a tempura fried light texture topped with avocado lime crema, chilies, lime, cilantro, and poco de gallo. Overall very balanced and refreshing, though a little greasier than I expected from the description of being \"roasted\" cauliflower.  The braised short rib was fork tender and flavorful! The green chile polenta was also tasty, but again, a little heavier than I expected. I liked the addition of pickled onions- the tangy flavor balanced the creaminess of the polenta and heaviness of the short rib.  I will definitely be back to try more beers and food options!"}
{"text":"Tried their fish and chips with Watermelon wheat beer. It was the Monday special. They do have a happy hour menu as well from 3-6pm which also looked good! Meal was tasty and the customer service was on point. Nice like place to eat before going grocery shopping at Whole Foods."}
{"text":"We have been frequenting Sprocket @ Whole Foods for years. We come here because they have a food rotating tap of local beers. The service is usually good and the food is always great. Today we went in and asked for a taster of one of their beers. This has never been an issue. Its standard to request a taster of a beer we have never had. We were told \"No. We can not give you a taster because the alcohol content is too high\". What? This was 10% ABV.  No explanation. Just 'No'. We just left. The server pretty much had the attitude of 'whatever'...took the menus away.  We went elsewhere. We usually order at least 2 beers each, an appetizer and entree each and tip well. Is there some new law we are not aware of? We are not buying a $10 beer without knowing if we like it. We went elsewhere to spend our money."}
{"text":"Interesting, although limited non-traditional menu, somewhat on the quirky side. Decent, but small selection of micro beers.  Stopped in during their first month of business, had fish and chips and was delighted to see they offered Left Hand Milk Stout, an excellent dark beer from a Colorado brewery, that is next to impossible to find in Nevada. Nothing special about the fish and chips, but it was fantastic to find a Milk Stout from Left Hand Brewery.  Went back a few weeks later, and to my great dismay, they had abandoned the Left Hand Milk Stout. Too bad, since I had gone out of my way and made a special trip there primarily for the Milk Stout.  Hate it when that happens! If you can't trust a joint to maintain their beer selection, you can't trust them for anything else.   What I really miss about this change of pace from Whole Foods is the loss of the gelato bar."}
{"text":"Way better than the food area at Sam's Club, which is usually filled with screaming children, but this place is still pretty forgettable.  Located inside Whole Foods, this is a good spot for a snack after shopping or to eat at before hitting the gluten free isles. Trust me, shopping hungry never ends well, you'll have an inflated grocery receipt and then come home with mostly sweet treats and snack foods.   This bar and restaurant offers flatbreads, sushi, burgers, salads, and a nice selection of beers. Everything you order off the menu is coming from the deli right next door and on the plus side everything gets made quickly. On the not so plus side, the food just serves the purpose of filling you up, nothing exciting or worth coming back for. Sprockets is simply utilitarian, it serves as quick stopping point between point A and point B. Shop, eat, and then carry on with your day.  Don't get me wrong the food is good, The flatbread mushroom pizza was tasty and the sushi was ok, but there's nothing really here to write home about. Would I go out of my way to come back to Sprockets, probably not, but would I stop in here for a quick snack after shopping, maybe, if the feeling struck me.   Definitely an A-OK spot for snack or beer."}
{"text":"Omg! How in the world have we not tried this place before?!? Oh yeah... They are across town and stop serving food at 9. By far... Their only downfall. They are going to be opening in the Charleston whole foods location soon... Which is so exciting!   We were greeted by a really nice young guy with tattoos. He was friendly and knowledgable about the food. He made excellent recommendations as well! Our water glasses stayed full and he made sure we had all the necessary condiments.  Their menu isn't huge... But it is beautiful. A lot of healthy items... Vegan and non vegan accommodating. They are so fairly priced that it's almost hard to believe they are located inside of whole paycheck whole foods.   We each ordered a glass of wine to start, both of which were amazing. We had a hard time trying to decide what to order because everything looked so good. We picked the vegan curry fries and mango chili vegan sushi to start. The food came out perfectly and promptly... Everything was so delicious. The curry fries were cooked perfectly and the vegan mango chili sushi was probably the best roll we've ever had. Black rice is the way to go! So good. Next we ordered the cauliflower nachos... They were amazing. We both love cauliflower... And these nachos weren't like the typical nachos. They had peppers and jalapeños and avocado... Fresh squeezed lime juice... It was pretty much a meal of perfection.   We had a really great meal and will definitely be back. The food tasted amazing, the service was wonderful, and the prices were totally fair! Definitely give them a try next time you are in the area!"}
{"text":"This review is for 3.5 stars.  I really liked the beer selection at Sprocket.  They had local brands like Big Dog's on draft as well as California, Colorado, and New York beers.  The prices are a little high ($6-$9), but granted it;' in a Whole Foods so that should be expected.  There were about 20 taps and 3 TVs so it's a legitimate bar scene.  The overall quality and quantity of beer is great.  The bartender wasn't the most knowledgeable, but she was friendly and offered samples before purchase which is much appreciated at a bar with numerous taps.  Overall I would come back, but I wish there was a nice Happy Hour or something to bring me back in the future.  They do have tap takeovers, however, which I will most likely attend in the future."}
{"text":"This place is tucked away inside of Whole Foods with no outside sign.   My girlfriend and I came here hungry on Christmas Eve. We gave up searching for food since everything closed early and decided to grab some groceries for the weekend. Lo and behold, a Christmas miracle! A food establishment with an excellent beer list and a really tasty burger (which my girlfriend and I both ordered).   Our bartender was really nice and the ambiance was pleasant with a pretty fun view of people picking out their groceries."}
{"text":"I came here to grab a bite to eat and wait for my boyfriend to get off work. I had two of their sushi rolls (4 pieces each) and they were pretty good. I tried the rainbow roll, and one of the vegan sushi rolls- the orchid roll. I was still a little hungry after that so I ordered the spicy smoked Gouda dip. The dip was pretty runny, maybe it was supposed to be like that... I dunno, but the flavor was ok. The main thing I noticed about this place was the bartender. I was only having a ginger ale but I heard him talk about the beers they had on tap and he was very knowledgeable and friendly.   Basically I was impressed with the bartender but I Probably won't be back again only because the food didn't blow my mind."}
{"text":"Meh. All the reviews previous mention they really like this place because of how cheap it is and all the vegan options. They increased the prices since going here today. When you see a menu on Yelp and get to the restaurant and the prices are more, it's annoying. The bartender sucked. She never brought utensils out for us and remembered we might want an extra plate after we already shared sushi on a tiny plate. The fact they don't have real soy sauce on the table for us and we have to open little packets of soy sauce makes it seem cheap. We ate our buffalo cauliflower nachos with chopsticks since she never brought utensils. They seemed like they should be crispy but they weren't. I don't know if the cook didn't leave them in long enough or this is how they're supposed to be. Why are they called nachos if there's no tortilla chips. Also, she took forever to get me my beer and it wasn't crowded. Will not come back. Overly priced, service sucks, and food is just meh."}
{"text":"This place is great! My husband and I have been here several times and the food is awesome. I highly recommend the fish and chips, the grass fed burger or the jackfruit quesadillas. Great idea Whole Foods!"}
{"text":"I love the beer selection, truly top notch. They had a certain demographic in mind with their chooses in breweries and I gotta say it's spot on. You should definitely try their cauliflower nachos as they are certainty the most mind blowing app on the menu. They  also cater to the vegan crowd with their Veggie Tamale, Beast Burrger many other healthy options like their Kale Salad served with pink lady apples and candied almonds. Of course if you're a carnivorous beast like myself then you'll enjoy the Short Rib entrée that is braised for over 72 hours and the Pub Burger made with grass fed beef. I would suggest adding an egg and bacon to that bad boy. All in all I think it should grow into something special. I also can't wait for the one on Las Vegas Blvd to open. The future holds big things for this new restaurant concept and my new favorite watering hole. Do yourself a favor and get here soon. Later."}
{"text":"Great variety for plant based folks which is great but all the food is prepared in the standard Whole Foods \"ready to eat\" area. One in our group has a severe shrimp allergy and we let them know that but there was definitely a shellfish of some kind that touched our order. This person ended up having a serious reaction to our food... so if you have food allergies maybe this isn't the best place for you..."}
{"text":"I went a couple weeks ago with my friend after we worked out close by, and we were excited that they had such a unique vegan/vegetarian selection.  Neither of us are either, but we appreciate it, and incorporate that type of food into our diet often.  We sat at the bar and my friend ordered sparkling wine or champagne and I got a nice pinot griogio.  I appreciate that they offered a small pour for me to try since I was contemplating that or another item.    For food we ordered 3 items:  The vegetable tamale: which is probably one of the best vegan dishes I have ever had.  The blend of flavors just hit so many notes, the sweet yet hearty nature of the black beans, the brightness heat and acidity from the fruit salsa, the sweet rounded flavors of the plantain, the creamy bright flavors of the avocado crema, and the masa that just brought all those flavors together into one big hug.    The beet hummus:  this was a vegetarian item the sweetness of the beets was contrasted with creamy goat cheese scattered throughout, and the toested pistachios brought a nice texture and contrast to it.    The orchid role:  vegan sushi! nice textures, good cook on the rice,  I was not missing the fish, it stood well on its own. It had a really nice marinade of the vegetables inside, and the pomegranate mayo was a great way to round out the flavors and add something dynamic to it.  They have two other vegan sushi rolls I can't wait to try.  All the food came out in a timely manner, the service was great, food innovative and fairly priced ( which is a surprise since whole foods is known for high price items).   They have a happy hour as well that has some fun things I would love to try. Even though it wasn't happy hour when we went we did qualify for a drink special.  Since we both got a drink it made it 5 each  which saved my friend 3 dollars since her drink was normally 8 for the glass.  I will be back"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to grab some happy hour! Such a great vibe, I've never been into the bar scene, so this is kinda a cool more casual spot to grab a locally craft beer and some good snacks. Definitely worth a shot!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my time here for happy hour, but I didn't love it because of the changed beers on tap.   Food: 1. The quesadilla was phenomenal! Meat was perfect, it had a nice avocado sauce over it! I would order this again. 2. Cheese platter: 2 cheeses, bread with a few nuts and spreads.  The beer: They only had 1 non-local beer on tap. I'm usually all for supporting local breweries and often go to them for this reason, but their beer just doesn't hold up to the San Diego beers. The first time I was here they had a more diverse selection than the second.   I'll be back, but I want them to bring back the other beers they had!"}
{"text":"They have the new menu out now with some great selections, flatbreads, sandwiches, appetizers, all amazing.  The staff here today are fast, friendly and really know how to make you feel welcome.  We had a party of 6 today, so we had 2 orders of the wings, they only offer 2 flatbreads now so we got one of each for the table and then some vegan sushi and some regular sushi.  Everything was amazing, the only point I can make is that the wings were not hot when they came to the table, they were cooked but had been sitting around before being served.  Like last time some sushi rolls were well made and some were very sad looking but overall everything was great, the price is right and we will be back.  The one thing I especially like is a girl kept coming around to check on our drinks which is a huge plus in a restaurant.  Our glasses were never empty that's how good the staff was today.  They work hard and try their best to make you feel comfortable and it was a great experience.  They have specials running all month so go check them out."}
{"text":"Very good food and selection of beers, but last few times we had to eat there we had to wait close to 30 minutes to pay because of some glitch in their credits card processing system. Staff seemed extremely overworked last few times, you could tell. Not sure if management changed, but it got worse.."}
{"text":"Service is good and they offer a lot of vegetarian options. They have local draft beers so that's nice to have too. It's located inside Whole Foods so you can just stop by to grab a drink and eat or eat before you shop. Will come by again."}
{"text":"Loved, loved, loved the Vegan Sushi!!! I ordered all three rolls and devoured them. So Ono!!! Will definitely be going back to try their other vegan options. Great location, great staff. Thank you for fulfilling my sushi needs"}
{"text":"I love it here! Finally, some yummy vegetarian and vegan options close to home! Add in some craft beer and you have a well-balanced diet :) I love all the vegan rolls, curried fries, and cauliflower nachos. I don't get anything else because those are the only things I need in rotation to keep me happy. Only reason for not giving 5 stars is because the chefs sometimes seem to be inconsistent. You go in expecting what you got the time before, and it turns out to be not as impressive. Doesn't happen all the time, but I don't think that should happen at all."}
{"text":"We managed to randomly stumble upon this place inside the Whole Foods on Green Valley Parkway. We had no idea that it was hidden away in the store as it doesn't advertise it from the outside! We noticed they had Poutine on their happy hour menu, and while it wasn't happy hour, we decided to have a go at it anyways. All I can say is \"wow\".   The two bartenders there were SUPER helpful and let us taste many of the beers they had on tap. While my pals took to drinking, I, as the DD, decided to grab a bite to eat. I ordered The Pub burger. Which at $12 is a little steep, but when the burger finally arrived and I took my first bite, I definitely would have spend twice that on it. Easily one of the best burgers I've had. Flavorful beef, cheddar, pickled red onion, butter lettuce, garlic aoli...   With their wide array of beers on tap, great menu choices like burgers, sushi, vegetarian options, happy hour deals and the helpful staff, I'll definitely be going back often. Especially to try that Poutine...   Don't let this place fall to the wayside. Get to the store!"}
{"text":"I met a work colleague here for a meeting. He recommended some place new to me, I've never been there before. It was a cute little bar/cafe section inside the local Whole Food Store. There were enough tables there to enjoy a meal, or sit and chat with friends. However, I was incredibly disappointed with the menu. I couldn't find a single chicken item besides wings? Luckily the waitress suggested I get a sandwich at the deli and bring it back. I felt bad for her because people like us, we're in there for hours, and kept bringing in food, versus ordering from her. I hope she was making a decent hourly wage versus a waitress wage plus tips. We did tip well, but doubt others do all the time. Whole Foods might consider a bigger, item selection for their menu. Not sure I would come back there. There were no outlets for any electronics. The only out left made us drag our power cord across the entrance into the kitchen. Not safe at all."}
{"text":"Great spot in Whole Foods to grab a quick bite to eat & enjoy some great beer. They have lots of different options & menus for traditional pub fare, sushi, and vegetarian. Beer selection is great & I tried the flight for $10. It's a great way to get a little of everything. The Friday I went they had music bingo which was a blast. You can play for prizes like free beer & food."}
{"text":"The revolving beer list and vegan menu options are a weekly endeavor. Not to mention creative vegan dishes: Cauliflower tempura, curry fries, and sushi rolls! I wish they had more stuff, but it's still early in the game for these guys. Oh, and if you need to grab some groceries? Bam. Done. With a good buzz of course."}
{"text":"I am really impressed with the overall quality of Sprocket. Who would have thought a bar/restaurant in Whole Foods could seriously deliver? I certainly did not, but am really glad I have continued to frequent this often crowded hotspot.  First, the service here is really incredible. These amazing women (and sometimes men covering breaks) manage to take care of the entire bar, dining room, AND take-out counter. Amazon clearly is testing superhuman powers out or something. Not to mention, I have seen some vile guests try and tear apart these rockstars, yet somehow, they've held it together and kept on going. Seriously, that's impressive.   As for the food, I'm just happy because Sprocket offers vegan and gluten free options (including Glutiny beer, yum). Oh yeah, and they serve the beyond burger. Enough said, try it out already! Happy hour is Mon-Fri until 6, and everyday there is a new all day special."}
{"text":"Never go grocery shopping on an empty stomach again. This cute little restaurant tucked away inside of the Whole Foods Market in Henderson has an excellent selection of food for vegans, vegetarians, and meat eaters alike. 24 beers on tap or wine if you feel like unwinding a bit.   Today I tried the roasted vegetable tamale, seasonal vegetables (roasted golden beets and winter squash), and the Meyer lemon fries. All were delicious, and I was particularly delighted with the plating of the tamale.  Wonderful food and hip atmosphere paired with the superb customer service Whole Foods is known for. And, now that my appetite has been so tastefully satisfied, I can shop without the danger of buying half the store. :)"}
