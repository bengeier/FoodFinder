{"text":"Nice clean restaurant. Smells like wonderfully smoky meat, which is always a good sign. I wish more of that smoked flavor had made it into my turkey. Sauces were good and there were a few creative unique items on the menu. We would return here if in the area again."}
{"text":"Brand new restaurant in Ogden. Using locally sourced meat, this new BBQ spot is the latest addition to this small town. Related to other Champaign county restaurants V. Picasso and the Wheelhouse.   The building is a renovated old bar at the corner of 150 and 49. The interior is fresh and inviting. Some booths and tables along with a few high top tables. A large bar makes up the center of the restaurant with several TVs on the walls. Very nicely done and perfect for a BBQ restaurant.   First off, clearly their specialty is pork given the name. The menu features numerous commonly found BBQ appetizers including smoked wings and fried pickles.   While the appetizers sounded good, I stuck with the main course this time around. Since pork seemed to be the obvious choice, I went with the $8 Pink Pig BBQ Pork sandwich with an included side of fries. The pork was shredded tasted like it came out of slow cooker. It was moist and tender but did not have much in the way of a smoky flavor. I had the Alabama White sauce on it. The sauce was similar to a ranch dressing with horseradish. It was decent but not my favorite. The pork was served on a plain white bun despite the menu calling it a \"cornmeal dusted brioche bun\". The sandwich was also served with a cole slaw. The cole slaw had a bitter vinegar sauce instead of the normal slaw sauce. Tasted like it was missing an ingredient or two. The fries were medium cut and had absolutely no seasoning. I do want to say that the house BBQ sauces (mild and hot) that are kept on the table, were delicious when combined. Highly recommend the sauce.   One thing to note, the kid's meal does not come with a drink no matter the waitress tells you. $2.50 for a kid's drink after the waitress said it was included is a but surprising. Despite addressing the discrepancy with the waitress, she still charged the full price.   While I was not impressed by the food or the service. It is the restaurant's first week and I am sure some of the bugs will get worked out."}
{"text":"It was all right, but it isn't really barbecue.  Like others have said, the pulled pork tasted like it was cooked in a roaster pan instead of a smoker.  At first, my chicken held more promise - the leg portion was done perfectly and had the smoky flavor that was missing from the pork.  Unfortunately the thigh portion was overcooked and dry.  Contrary to my initial impressions, the pulled pork turned out to be better than the chicken despite not being actually barbecued.  The fried cheese curds were amazing owing mostly to the accompanying spicy marinara sauce (marinara paired with horseradish or sriracha- I'm not sure which).  The service was decent.  The bottom line: If I was craving barbecue, I would probably make the drive into Champaign for a different option.  On the other hand, If I wanted a quick, decent (non bbq) meal or a beer and fried cheese curds, I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I almost gave it 4 stars, pulled pork and smoked turkey were a little dry. The portions are big and the prices are very reasonable. Service was great and good bbq in the Midwest is few and far between. Can't wait to go back! Revolution on tap!"}
{"text":"This place is very cool!  Do not pass up on the wings! Very good smoked then flash fried and tossed with a slightly sweet and spicy glaze.  Friendly and attentive service. We will be back, for sure."}
