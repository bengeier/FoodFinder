{"text":"I really wanted to like this neighbourhood resto as it is a welcome Greek addition to the Monkland multicultural eating choices. Sorry to say it missed on so many counts. While the interior is bright and immaculate, the decor is cold and lacks the taverna feel. The tables and chairs look good but as soon as we sat down we found them exceedingly uncomfortable. Were they ordered online and no one tested them before they were purchased? Hoping the food would change our first impression, we ordered a pikilia and fried zucchini to test the basics. Except for the taramasalata and dolmades, everything else on the plate disappointed. In particular, the tzatziki - the prime ingredient to good Greek food. It was runny, lacking garlic and mostly tasted of the added dill. Two olives? For $10.50 the zucchini was a total waste. Limp and oily served with the same bland tzatziki. Another important test, the souvlaki pita. Served Greek style with fries, but mustard and ketchup? Not for us. Again, good quality fresh ingredients in both the chicken and pork but totally lacking flavour. My husband had the grilled lamb chops and found them acceptable, though the accompanying fries were not as good as expected from previous reviews. The best I can say about this restaurant is that the service is very friendly and attentive and the price for the souvlaki was reasonable. With the sudden demise of Massa last year, I really hoped this would be as good or almost so. Because I would like to see these very nice people succeed, perhaps the food will improve and I will give it another try."}

{"text":"This was the day when the missus and I had pretty much had it with cooking. So, on a whim, we decided to try out this new Greek restaurant that I'd been nagging her about since I noticed that the renovation wrap had come down from the windows.  What a great idea! I truly amaze myself sometimes, I do.  We started off by sharing an order of saganaki, choosing the Kefalograviera over the Halloumi. It was wonderful, and I especially appreciated that the dish was not accompanied by a bevy of frantic wait-staff yelling Opa! Opa! then setting my food ablaze. Simplicity rules; and this dish needed no greek gyrations or Hellenic handstands to enhance the dish. This delicious fried melty cheese appetizer instead whispered to me that we were in good hands. Authentic hands. Hands from the Old Country that know that quality comes from the ingredients and preparation.  For the main, we ordered a bottle of Retsina, some chicken brochettes for the missus, and a plate of married sardines for myself. Honestly, I thought that \"married sardines\" was a typo and that they meant \"marinated sardines\" but no; these little sardines were sandwiched together then cooked with simple, tasty spices and served alongside grilled zucchini and a little bowl of mashed chickpeas (or something). The plate (see the photo I uploaded) reminded me of the fresh-from-the-sea sardines that I had had that one time in Paros so I was sublimely happy.  The Missus's brochettes were also delicious. She let me have a tiny nibble and no more. You know things are good when the missus doesn't share!  I should also mention that I learned something that night too. I've been a fan of Retsina since the *cough-cough* twentieth century and I was delighted when the waitress suggested that I try the wine with a squirt of Pepsi. Seriously. I had never heard that Retsina could be drunk this way and the expression on my face showed it. However, being adventurous I took her up on it and tried it.  OPA!! adding Pepsi to Retsina wine turns it into a kind of Vermouthy aperitif! Amazeballs!! Best discovery ever!!  Desert? I wasn't hungry, but I knew that I wasn't ready to stop eating. I asked for the Loukoumades and was not disappointed. These light and fluffy deep-fried balls of happiness (think donut batter) were served piping hot and covered with a lovely sheen of greek honey. What a perfect way to end a meal.  My only negative comment on the evening would have to be about the chairs. They're not super comfy, but then again I completely stopped thinking about them the moment the food arrived.  I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"The place is only about a week old - no liquor license yet, but it's coming. We went in tonight just wanting to share an appetizer plate. We had Pikilia for 2 ($18) and some terrific coffee. Food was very fresh, service was insanely good, decor is gorgeous. Very nice addition to Monkland Avenue!"}
{"text":"Nice Griffintown style decor. Food is not the best but considering the price, decent and some dishes on the plus side. Some of the staff seemed zoned out and not understanding customer service. All in all, the service on this night resulted in 3 stars rather than 4."}
{"text":"I got to try this super sweet family restaurant with a gang of best girlfriends. Some of us came hangry and therefore found the service slow, but I thought it was ok for a busy spot being managed entirely by two hard working parents in the open kitchen, and two adult kids managing all the tables.   The ambiance is bright but still cozy and dinner appropriate. The vibe is friendly and chatty with families hanging out and folks celebrating birthdays.   My friends were very happy with their chicken pitas, and we all loved the delicious warm homemade bread and olive tapenade. I ordered the sea bass which had very nice flavour, but a fair amount of bones. I loved the Greek potatoes and salad that came with this dish.   There aren't a ton of veggie options but there is a veggie pita that I'd love to try next time, and plenty of veggie apps i could dig into.   The real highlight here is the warmth and authenticity of the service. You feel like you are hanging out with a friendly, hopeful family in Greece. What a great addition to Monkland Avenue!"}
{"text":"This new spot is very endearing and nicely laid out. The food is great and the prices decent. The decor is slightly off but in a cute way (the shelves aren't aligned straight and it's a bit clich√© with the knick knacks).  The waiting staff is a bit eclectic. Some older staff are very serviable and cordial, but the younger are a bit cold. It can get very loud and busy on friday night (not sure about saturday), but sunday night is pretty laidback. Perfect for a family dinner in NDG! I love the complimentary pita with olive tapenade fresh out the oven"}
{"text":"Yes, the chicken souvlaki plate is only $12.50, and boy, do you get your money's worth! Food is good, service is fast and they also give you yummy tapenade with pita to start the meal. They have a nice terrasse outside, which is good for people watching, and it's kid-friendly, as they have high chairs. A great addition to Monkland village."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and the restaurant has a nice cozy feel. Doesn't feel like a whole hustle and bustle authentic restaurant and sticks to it's style. The service however was a bit slow but overall a nice place and great food."}
{"text":"Loved it, yummy calamari, delicious chicken platter, good service. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"What a gem! My new \"go to\" place for Greek food! Everything was delicious and so very fresh! From the toasty and warm fluffy pita with a chopped olive paste to the sinfully, tender marinaded chicken brochettes (which were served with a hearty portion of tomatoes, lettuce and red onions, topped with a triangle of seasoned feta, a small scoop of cooked rice seasoned with marinated pepper and onion and two wedges of Greek potatoes) with a side of Mythos beer, the atmosphere was very reminiscent of authentic Greek tavernas, the service was impeccable and very friendly. Family run with love and professionalism. Sadly, because it was busy on a Friday night, the loukamades were not available - but I'll be going back to try the pitas!   *went back to try the chicken pita and OMG! Sumptuous and delicious! For 9$ you get the pita, fries and a drink! Best healthy cheap delicious authentic Greek meal you can get in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Nice place, food its ok,  lot of fries but less salade , fries even inside the pita ...  its maybe normal because we all like friessssss ;) But think to ask rice or more salade if you prefer healthy this time."}
{"text":"Charming Greek restaurant. I had the pikilia for two. The tzadiki, stuffed wine leaves and bread was super delicious. Staff extremely friendly and provided an great service. Stop by for some great Greek food on Monkland."}
