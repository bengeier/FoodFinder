{"text":"Stopped in last week because I had a MASSIVE sugar craving and I really really wanted a brownie. Bread & Roses delivered! My brownie was decadently sweet. The icing was luscious and though I made a mess eating it, it was a mess I gladly licked clean. I bought my roommate a fruit tart because it looked so beautiful (I secretly wanted to eat both but stopped myself). 

I'm super happy to live close to here and will be fulfilling my sugar cravings here again soon."}
{"text":"Food and coffee are very good except their customer service. They have no smile and when i asked for a napkin, they just looked and pointed..so i feel like wtf is it!
I hope the owner checks review on yelp and change their employees' attitude"}
{"text":"Cute little bakery and cafe in the heart of Bloor West Village. I go there specifically for the delicious broccoli and cheese croissants and they're usually already sold out!"}
{"text":"Have been coming to this cafe on and off for a few years.  However, today was a horrible experience.  I placed an order at the sandwich counter with for a turkey breast sandwich and then paid for the meal. About 15 minutes later they call out that a chicken salad sandwich is ready and then I told the cashier and the same girl that took my order that I ordered a turkey sandwich.  15 minutes later I still don't have my sandwich.  30 minutes or more have past and in fact she did not even start making my turkey sandwich and when I asked for my sandwich she asks me \"you wanted a turkey sandwich?\".  Anyway, I asked for a refund and got one and spoke to the owner.  No apology from the girl making the sandwich from the counter but at least the owner seemed concerned.  Food is fine but in this instance VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE."}
{"text":"Bread & Roses is a successful blend of cafe and bakery atmospheres. You can get a light lunch on the front patio or inside, or just walk in and grab of loaf of something and be on your way again. Neither \"space\" feels like it's encroaching on the other here.

Bread & Roses has a wide variety of baked goods, although you have to use your judgement if you want to find a good deal. The bagels are great at $3.50 per half dozen, but the pierogies at $5 per half dozen seems a bit steep--even if they're the size of calzones."}
{"text":"They have a hygine problem here...I saw a cockroach while I was dining...on two separate occasions. That is one and a half times too many. The first time, I let it slide, but two times?! 
Also, their \"fresh squeezed orange juice\" they say they make in house and charge $4 for, is a lie. An employee let slide that it is actually just commercial orange juice from a box. This establishment lies to customers."}
{"text":"How is this place so popular?!

Is it the over priced sandwiches? The smell of urine from the bum that hangs out outside? The undercooked chocolate chip cookies?

This place has line ups out the door at lunch time. I keep going back because Bloor West Village lacks options, but it just isn't good."}
{"text":"I excitedly bought some macaroons from there this evening as I was just browsing around bayview village. Just took them out to enjoy few minutes ago to find that they're stale macaroons. Out of the 6 that I bought, (2 green teas, 1 earl grey, 1 cappuccino, 2 pistachios) only the pistachio macaroons were not stale. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The bakery is pretty typical bakery...

BUT, the one time to for sure try is their cookies...oh, that's the only thing I purchase there now."}
{"text":"The soups, salads and sandwiches are delicious and very healthy.  I found the roast beef sandwich a little bland but I have enjoyed everything else I have ordered from here.  The ladies I work with go crazy for the carrot muffins and I LOVE the double chocolate cupcakes :).  The ladies that work here are very sweet and helpful so it's always a great customer service experience.  The decor is pretty out-dated but this place is totally worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I now come here for brunch every weekend. The breakfast sandwiches are the most amazing tasting sandwiches in the world. They usually get sold as soon as they are made, but the staff have made fresh ones for me a few times which shows their amazing service. My favourite pastry is the pear Danish which has the most amazing tasting custard with half a pear on top. I limit myself to one or two on the weekend, but throughout the week I fantasize about them. I have tried their paninis, omelettes, and quiche (the ham and leek is another of my favourite go-to's) and have yet to try something I haven't absolutely loved. I have yet to try any of their salads but they look incredibly fresh and yummy. They are always busy and people seem to love coming here for the incredibly fresh food, grilled veggies, good espresso and amazing pastries!"}
{"text":"They have great sandwiches made with really soft housemade bread. I love their grilled veggies. Their seafood salad is amazing, I crave it time to time. Now, their pastries are also great. I usually don't have a sweet tooth but their chocolate chunky cookies are my absolute favourite and their chocolate macaroons are so moist! Gelato also made in-house."}
{"text":"Honestly, I think this place is a hidden gem. They have consistently amazing food. I've tried their paninis, soups, quishes, and salads, and I can testify that they're consistently fresh and tasty. In terms of sandwiches, the quality tends to depend on the server, but they're almost always good. The pastries are always good too; make sure to try the almond tart. In terms of cakes, the napoleon and berry tart are my favourite, but the freshness tends to vary. Servers are very friendly & patient. One of the gems in Bayview Village!!"}
{"text":"Arguably the best coffee shop in Bayview Village, with more soul than the other mega chains located in the mall.  

Compared to the competition, they have the best service, with a core regular staff that doesn't rotate as much as the soul-less Aroma, Pusateri's, Lettieri, or Starbucks that are your alternatives.  Sure there is the other food court style café whose name escapes me, but Bread and Roses has better food.

They serve illy coffee and have a crepe and gelato station along with high quality pastries: this gives this place a much more premium feel than the more crowded seating at the other places where you seem to always be fighting for a table.

The former Delices de Bayview located in this same place used to be a favourite of mine, and I see myself continuing this tradition with Bread and Roses."}
{"text":"Came here twice, and was not disappointed - except that they don't have cannoli (or lobster tails).

I told my husband, I refuse to drink bad coffee, and this place does not disappoint.

I tried their napolitan, and it was as creamy and fresh as can be (not soggy at all)."}
{"text":"Well it's a coffee shop in a mall, so one needs to start with that.  Despite that, i think a few lines of review are important b/c there are lots of other choices at Bayview Village.  

Their espresso based coffees aren't that great.  The selection of food/pastries are limited and the prices although not on the high end, aren't value.  Arshawn and I had an Americano and cranberry juice (you can figure who had what) and it came to $4.50 which is not bad - but again, the coffee was a bit bland.  I may try this place again in the distant future but not for their coffee."}
{"text":"This place has great sandiwches and soups.  They are large and plentyful and full of flavour.  The staff is great too.

I often go at lunch time and have either a Roast Beef or Turkey Sandwich (with cranberry sauce).  My other favourite is one of their Soups of the day!

Oh!  and the pumpkin pies (large and small) are excellent (when they are \"in season\" of course.

There's an amazing selection of breads too.

This is a great place to stop and have lunch if you're in Bloor West Village (it's just a short walk west from High Park)."}
{"text":"I was at Bread and Roses Bakery, location, Bloor Street West & Runnymede, in Toronto. I got coffee and blueberry muffin. As I was having coffee I attempted to take an antibiotic pull, but I dropped it onto the floor. It was the last pill that I had to take, so I had to wash it. I asked a tall Korean woman (employee) whether I could briefly use the water sink to wash the pill? The woman in her twenties responded very rudely, manner-less and aggressively. She refused to let me use the sink to wash my medicine. Instead, she pointed by her hand that I should go wash it into the washroom. To start with, I didn't know there was washroom, because if I did I could have just gone to the washroom on my own. The same woman served me when I bought coffee and muffin. But amazing, it was needed just a little test to bring out a monster from this woman. This business has been in this location for decades, even before this woman was born. These people have been serving the customers, predominantly white women, for decades... But sad story that after all if those decades they didn't learn to live their customers. They are mean racists, and they will tell to any customer even if slightly challenged. I hope I will never buy anything from these mobsters. It is, simply, inhumane regards a way the Bread and Roses Bakery thinks about their customers..."}
{"text":"I am glad that I discovered this place and that it's near my home, great bakery with great cookies (I'm dying to try more things, but the chocolate cookies were to die for), amazing cakes and good coffee. Will for sure come back."}
{"text":"The best pumpkin pie/tarts in Toronto!!! Great soups too!"}
{"text":"I've been to this coffee shop a few times and every time I visit the food and service is great. Sometimes the line is really long (imagine the lunch rush) but it's worth it. It's a cute coffee shop in the middle of the mall with delicious baked goods. They also have gluten and lactose free options. 

PS: The Macaroons are amazing!"}
{"text":"mmmm delicious fresh baked goods and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee.
great chocolate chip cookies
and cheesy cheescake and they have a little patio outside and about 10 tables inside."}
{"text":"Good pastries and nice customer service. Great for a short break with a coffee. Sandwiches are not wonderful, but cupcakes and croissants are excellent."}
{"text":"My mother and I decided to go for coffee and settled on Bread and Roses Bakery at the Bayview Village location.  We ordered our two coffees and pastries with one of the abrupt staff members.  No problem! we ignored the fact and looked for a table to sit at.  There seemed to be one table available.  It had a cup on it and a receipt.  The cup was less than 1/4 full of lemon water, so naturally my mother and I assumed that a previous customer had left it there and we removed it to settle down and enjoy our morning.  After about 5-10 minutes, a lady came rushing over to our table and angrily asked \"did you move my cup\" and as I was replying in confusion \"I'm sorry?\" she shoved my knee, which was sticking out a bit and walked off.  To my surprise, she was one of the staff members - my mother and I were in disbelieve that she was being so rude to us customers.  The women sitting next to us was also surprised by her behavior.  I was so baffled that I walked over to the counter and asked to speak to the manager from the same abrupt, emotionless staff member we had initially purchased our coffee and pastries from.  This staff member pointed to the person next to her and I began to explain our situation.  I asked that the manager speak to this staff member and address her rude behavior.  She simply stated \"okay\" but did not speak this individual.  I'm not even sure if she was truly the manger - she had no care in the world for what I had to say.  Overall, no customer service here whatsoever.  Just extremely rude, robotic staff members.  If you see a staff member with a roller in her hair to keep her bangs from her face, stay away, stay far away!!!"}
{"text":"Walked into this bakery store at BV today, want to try their scones and danishes. Before getting the scones, I want to know what kind of flavors they have; there was no lineup and the cashier was very impatient and seems she had a bad day, very bad customer service, won't recommend and return."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a pre-workout panini. I wasn't expecting much when I saw that all the vegetables were pre-grilled and in the panini. However, upon biting my sandwich I couldn't tell. Very tasty, just cheesy enough and a good balance of flavour. Also, got a few veggies on the side and what appears to be homemade dressing."}
{"text":"There's certainly not a lot to complain about, I truly enjoyed my experience here and honestly can't wait till the next time I'm in this neighbourhood and can visit again. I give it a 4.75. The staff was really friendly and although they didn't have one of tye ingredients to make the drink that I wanted to order, the lady was willing to accommodate and made my drink completely customized! 

It was quite busy when I arrived and as a matter of fact, it was busy for the entire 5 hours I was there doing homework (works out great that their Wi-Fi is reliable). Every time I looked up from my seat there was a line up at the door, maybe it's because it was a Saturday?  

Theres a huuuggeee selection of breads and pastries to choose from, all of which looked absolutely delicious!  They also serve sandwiches,  bagels and soup. The obly negative is that I saw their prices looked a liiitttllee in the pricey side, but they did look like quality sandwiches,  so maybe it's worth the premium."}
{"text":"Meh. I had the quiche. It was over $5 for an individual quiche. It was pretty good. Had a red velvet cookie too. Also pretty good. Place isn't bad but there are better options in Bloor West Village for sure"}
{"text":"I got a small pastry, which looks like some sort of Napoleon. I forget the name but it has pistachio, sweet pastry cream and a cookie base.

I was disappointed because it was so hard and stale; nothing light or flaky. It was dry and I just didn't want to eat the rest of it. Although there were little crunchy bits, I barely tasted any pistachio. Rather indulge my calories elsewhere.

Tea was okay. Rooibos has nice citrus note."}
{"text":"I came here after dinnertime on a Friday evening in search of coffee and desserts, and nothing more or less than that. We were able to choose from a good assortment of cakes and pastries -- unlike at Aroma or most other cafés/restaurants, where the assortment of cakes will comprise chocolate mousse, cheesecake, and red velvet. The cream puff was fresh and not soggy -- and the least expensive of all! The cake was well made and I would compare it to something you might have at DT Bistro. The apricot strudel (pastry?) was not too sweet and offered a nice change from the other two sweets.

Although it was expensive, the mall was fairly quiet and we were able to enjoy the dessert. The only drawback is that there aren't many spots to sit inside the café space itself and most seating is in the mall, in the middle of the general walkway. I would definitely mark this down as a suitable dessert place, as there aren't many like this in Toronto!"}
{"text":"meh.  pretty standard issue food.  nothing to write home about.  EXCEPT FOR THE MACAROONS! they're divine, to die for.  

if you're in bwv and hungry, there's a dozen better alternatives, but get the chocolate macaroons for dessert.  it's a requirement."}
{"text":"A little on the pricey end for baked goods, but the baked goods are GOOD. Also their coffee products are great. The set up is annoying (order your desserts on one side and coffee and food on another side), but the service is good and overall they do a good job."}
{"text":"A must-visit when you're in Bloor West Village.

I've been a customer for a few years now, and their staff is always friendly. 

Yummy treats for folks of all ages - the clientele mostly local stay-at-home moms with their kids, local senior citizens and high school kids (during school year). 

Their freshly baked breads are fantastic and if you order a sandwich to stay in to eat, they will cut you nice, thick, slices from their fresh loaves. 

It gets a little busy during peak times (lunchtime, especially). There is lots of seating room inside and in the back, and a cute patio with bistro tables outside in the summer. 

Prices are what you would expect from Bloor West Village. Stop in for a treat. You'll like it.  And yes, the cookies are great!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying the turkey/chicken pot pie, only turkey available, it was DECENT, MEDIOCRE at best.  Accompanying soup also average.  Latte was good!  I think the word that best comes to mind is AVERAGE."}
{"text":"After a second visit to satisfy my cake craving I just had to put Bread and Roses in the Yelp spotlight which it really deserves.
I believe it was near the end of this past April that a friend and I came across this corner cafe at Bayview Village. My friend mainly tagged along since I was in need of a caffeine (and treats) fix and wanted to check out a place that was more alluring than Timothy's. I ended up passing up one particular cafe in favor of this truly hidden gem. It was most definitely the name (!!Bread & Roses!! simply has quaint ring to it) that drew me to it and once I saw the delectable display of gelati and very well-crafted cakes and pastries my friend and I both were convinced to try it out. Service was prompt and positive. I think we both got a medium sized gelato each, which came with two generous scoops as shown in the pictures. I also remember the coffee retaining a strong enough flavor of caffeine. 
I returned for a second trip today to get their cakes even though they are a tad bit pricey at a little over $6 dollars per portion and decided on the Tarte aux Fruits and Dumas a chocolate mousse based cake, both which just looked too good to be devoured. 
The cakes, gelato and pastries seem to be the highlights at Bread & Roses and I am not sure whether I would be keen enough to try out their sandwiches and salads any time soon. 
Next summer I'll go check out the location on Bloor St. West"}
{"text":"Bread and Roses is an average bakery with a large selection. I made the mistake of coming in here wearing a toque and carrying a backpack on a cold day. The girl managing the line completely skipped me. I finally realized that I must've looked homeless, and found someone else who was willing to wait on me. She seemed to know what happened and compensated by being super nice. (They must have a problem with homeless people here... Either in attitude or challenges with begging).

The food here is hit and miss. Cleanliness here is hit and miss. The cinnamon rolls are huge, but mostly just bread. The cookies are better than many, but not the best. The sandwiches are better than average. Prices are commensurate with good value."}
{"text":"We were having dinner at a friends place around the and was searching for a pie as dessert. I'm so glad we stumbled onto this little neighborhood gem!!  They had a whole shelf of pies with an assortment of fillings, and the service was very patient as we mulled over our choices.  We settled on the blueberry pie and it was definitely a hit at the dinner.

They also have a wide variety of baked goods, from scones to bread to meals (I saw someone having soup). The peach danish looked so good that we had it as a pre-dinner snack. The pastry was light, the custard was generous and the peach was juicy. I haven't had such a good danish in ages! Will be back if I'm ever in the neighborhood again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for breakfast and at past 8 it was starting to get busy. Most of the people are just ordering coffee and/or pastry to go. We decided to order a full breakfast, one American and the other eggs benny. (Just ok, nothing special). My eggs benny came in after 15minutes. 20 mins later after I finished my eggs benny, the other order hasn't arrived yet. I had to follow up twice, and when it came out, the wheat bread looked like leftovers, one was toasted the other wasnt. Cashier had a 'dont care attitude'. The only saving grace was the good coffee. Definitely not worth the $34."}
{"text":"i was visiting Toronto and was suggested this place since I was going to be in the neighborhood. 

It was really nic,e with friendly staff and a homely atmosphere. I got a  cup of tea, a chocolate covered macaroon and a cookie that I took to the patio. I thought all of that was great and very reasonably priced..less than 4 dollars. The only problem was that an old lady outside kept smoking which was bothering me but I was too tired to go inside to tell the staff . Plus I don't know if in Canada you are allowed to smoke near such establishments."}
{"text":"Saturday's in the summer the sunny patio is packed Bread and Roses, while in the winter, people take solace inside. Warm soups, fresh bread, and a mushroom melt sandwich that will make you weep can easily fill you up and make you feel warm again. And while sandwiches are all good, I mainly go for the sweets. They make mean pies, sugar cookies for every time of the year and serve these fantastic chocolate chunk cookies that are soft, chewy and a bit crunchy all in one. Really, seriously, it's becoming a problem for me because Bread and Roses is open later than other bakeries in the area and it's so close to my apartment!"}
{"text":"We go here often, and it's a great little cafe! Everything we tried there (eat in & to-go) is always excellent. They are well staffed (always at least 5 people behind counter) and they are attentive and cheerful.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Okay place to sit outside with coffee and a bagel or enjoy a light snack.  For baked goods, however, I strongly prefer either Cob's or Hot Oven, both very close by."}
{"text":"You pay LESS for exactly the same cakes, desserts, and pastry from Pusateri's. I got a big pistachio cake for a birthday party and it was fresh and affordable compared to other well known bakeries. Excellent customer service and the manager of the store including the workers were very positive and fast. I would definitely come here for brunch or coffee and desserts."}
{"text":"This cafe actually makes the US customs an enjoyable experience. I've had an easier time crossing the border than ordering food here. 

You're first greeted by many signs that command you to line up in different spots, depending on what you're ordering. There's one for \"foods,\" and one for coffee/drinks/pastries. If you so much as stand in the wrong line, you'll get your a** whooped. I'm talking, literally schooled. 

I first lined up in the foods section to get aforementioned snack, and the lady there barked at me to get into the coffee line instead. So I went to the coffee section and guess what--the cashier there actually rolled her eyes and shot back, \"can't you read signs? This line's for drinks only!\" She then took my order in the rudest and most impatient tone ever. As soon as she saw the the middle-aged white customers behind me, however, she practically broke into smiles and chirruped \"it's so good to see you!! Haven't seen you in forever!!!\" Low-key does not bother to hide the racism.

When the coffee arrived, it came in these cups that were very hard to carry. So I asked for an extra tray to hold my drinks, and after more grumbling from the staff, they threw a tray to the side for me to pick up. Thanks very much, I'd rather serve myself too at this point. I started fearing for my life.

The service here certainly outshines its food and drinks, which are otherwise bland. There is a fair selection of quiches, but I won't come back, I prefer living. As with the US customs, being white, a little older, and a regular visitor goes a long way."}
{"text":"I thought the macarons here were done just they way I like. A nice chew with a nice outer shell. Also tried some of the cookies here which were also good but would still prefer the cookies at Felix & Mr Norton."}
{"text":"Came here at the recommendation of a friend. It was quite good. It's quite busy, but the selection of pastries is good. They are light and not overly sweet, not the best I've ever had, but still super yummy! 

Make sure they know you're in line because they sometimes can't tell between the people who are still looking and people who want to order. 

Soups are quite underwhelming, other food doesn't look super appetizing...it's all about the pastries!"}
{"text":"If you love pumpkin pie, this is the place to go! When I was new in Toronto I googled the best pumpkin pies in TO to complete my Thanksgiving meal. And I am so glad I did. From the moment I tasted this pumpkin pie a few years back, I've been coming back every year for more. Their butter tarts and coconut macaroons are also delicious! 
The only drawback is that they only offer the pumpkin pie seasonally and the washrooms at this location are very unfresh so I always take my things to go."}
{"text":"Not necc. A four-star place since the place has new need for seniority. But the staff can be a boon to the shop as they are MOSTLY friendly & helpful. The shop how ever is charming and the pastries r super wonderful!"}
{"text":"This place has the best pastries/bread at the most affordable prices. A hearty lunch can be had for under $10/person. It can be a bit difficult to snag a table during lunchtime but people tend to vacate the tables quickly after eating so you shouldn't have to wait too long. Both the tuna melt and the turkey pot pie are delicious. And the cookies are pretty yummy."}
{"text":"lovely lovely spot, everything is always fresh and their coffee is fantastic and inexpensive. The little chocolate chip cookies on display near the cash register are divine! The staff is always friendly and efficient and the place is always busy."}
{"text":"Absolute favorite high park food stop. Always fresh and tasty! Have fantastic soups and pastries!"}
{"text":"I love Bread & Roses - I'd say its baked good aren't the absolute best (which is why it didn't get 5 stars), but the variety is great, service is quick and atmosphere is cozy.  In the summer I spent many lunches on their patio eating their yummy sandwiches and in the winter I've huddled inside.  It does get a bit crowded inside but turnover is quick so it's not too  much of a problem.  I often swing by Bread & Roses to pick up food for entertaining like quiches, desserts, cookies - they are all great!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd visit to this locally popular bakery cafe. Lineup was really slow though there were 4 counter staff, 3 women and 1 man. The vanilla cake with strawberries didn't have enough whipped cream for my admittedly over the top gourmand standards and the cake slice was a bit stale. My daughter's carrot cake also didn't have  enough cream cheese frosting for her tastes. So they were both good, but not outstanding. My other younger daughter who isn't as fussy as we two, gobbled her blueberry cheesecake and vacuumed up the rest of the carrot cake and of my mocha coffee, that tasted so burned and bitter I couldn't finish it. I ended up with the other daughter's latte, which was better tasting. Given the really bad burned mocha, I can't give this cafe more than 3 stars. It's OK, but it's no Starbucks."}
{"text":"I've lived in the BWV area for almost 10 years and never dared ventured into Bread & Roses...until now!  I was always scared off by hoards of European seniors on the patio and crowding the front counters.  

I finally decided to \"woman up\" and push my way in there.  I had a baby in a stroller and figured if it was too busy, I'd grab lunch to go.  To my surprise, it was relatively quiet inside and I even spied a few empty tables that I could sit and park my carriage. 

I ordered a toasted turkey sandwich ($6.99) on multigrain bread with extra pickles on the side, a coffee ($1.55) and a chocolate cookie ($0.75).

Service was quite friendly and delightful.  They delivered my lunch tray to my table after I ordered. The turkey sandwich was delish - the addition of cranberry sauce was a nice surprise!

I think I'm going to be a weekly regular here and I attracted some new senior friends with my baby.  I'm in with them!"}
{"text":"Great spot! Lovely staff, freshly prepared food, great pastries, bread, cakes etc. Sandwiches are lovely also. I go here once a week with the kids, they love it - I love it. You see a lot of the same customers, and a lot of the same staff over the years. The seating area is nothing fancy. The toilets are pretty shabby. But I love it."}
{"text":"Love this place!

Food is great,made fresh. Bread is always fresh &Staff is very friendly as well as accommodating. So many times I've created my own sandwiches & they've been able to help. 

Great spot to have a bite & catch up :)"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and received horrible service from the cashier. Like literally no smiles or greet but the two others had great service. It sucks that it was a good cafe to eat at a few years ago.. everything went downhill from there.. not sure if it's worth the visit anymore."}
{"text":"Bread and Roses is always busy. This is a good sign. I find Bloor West Village to be not a very delicious neighbourhood as a whole. Bread and Roses is one of the best options for a healthy sandwich, salad or soup for lunch with fresh fresh fresh bread and a forgettable coffee. The number one reason I stop into Bread and Roses is the chocolate macaroons. If you are a fan of these chocolatey, coconutty creations, this is THE place."}
{"text":"Their chocolate chip cookies have the best texture. Slightly chewy but not too soft and kind of firm. They also know what's good about cookie ingredients. Brown sugar and real butter!"}
{"text":"People even in the east end of Toronto know this place for their lovely turkey sandwiches. I love the bakery goods. The chocolate covered macaroons and the ginger bread men are my favourite. The staff are friendly. You can get a lovely comforting lunch here with a pot pie, soup or sandwich. The décor is pretty simple but it is a welcoming place. LOVE it!"}
{"text":"Bread & Roses in located inside Bayview Village Shopping Centre. A second location of http://www.yelp.ca/biz/bread-and-roses-bakery-cafe-toronto Bread and Roses in Bloor West Village.

Super busy on a Sunday afternoon. A good place for baked goods, a sandwich or cookie.

They carries Rahier's products too. 

There is seating both inside and outside of the Cafe. 

Butter Tarts ($2.75) and Tea ($2.65) were great as an afternoon tea break or they have espresso or smoothies too."}
{"text":"Bread & Roses Bakery Cafe has a great vibe and a great selections of baked goods. 

Sweet, Sweet, Sweet and More Sweet! 

Plain Croissants 
- Not bad, not buttery enough! I can tell when it is not too flaky and crisp when I tearing it apart! 

Cookies 
- soft and chewy cookies... great little bite size... 

Chocolate Macaroons 
- intensive coconut sweetness... a little too sweet for my taste, but my friend seems to enjoy that! Great to have one of this with a strong cup of coffee 

The servers are all so friendly and helpful. Large seating area if you want to eat in... even when I buy that one Macaroon she was nice enough to ask me if I want to have it to stay!"}
{"text":"I remember this place being way better when I was in high school, but I'm not sure if the baked good tasted better or if I have greater expectations now. First off, if you're gonna order anything here, order the chocolate macaroons. SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO good. They were good when I was 19, and they're still good at 29. Also, they make a delicious turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce. I bought a blueberry pie here for a coworker - she loved it, but she has no sense of smell, which means her taste buds aren't very reliable. I've personally had way better blueberry pies (Wanda's Pie in the Sky). I order custard tarts here and I seriously had to toss them. So gross. Maybe it was a bad batch?"}
{"text":"Awesome pastries and bread.... Everything is fantastic! 

Great food in the cafe too! 

The Tuna melt is my favourite, on whole grain bread."}
{"text":"An \"I Have Yet To Yelp\" Yelper Who Shall Not Be Named urged me to get a raspberry muffin from Bread & Roses while on a manicure mission, and since I hadn't had one since my days as an overnight donut decorator I thought, why not?

I waited in a Jonas Brothers-esque lineup, except that everyone in the queue was 60 and not 16. But I waited a good 40 minutes for said muffin, and it was 2pm on a Thursday. By the time I got to the front of the line they were out of muffins, but they weren't out of Tomato Rice soup. And if you know only one factoid about me, it's that I'm absolutely cuckoo for rice soups. It was great value ($3) with bread and nicely packaged up to go. According to the signage the soup is \"homemade\" (their quotes: http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/c6ZJNNcruSMntRbm_VtbRg?select=LcvTkkJII69bEE0AaiwAIQ) Worth the wait with whiteheads to get it!"}
