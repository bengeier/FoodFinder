{"text":"Decent cafe food for above-decent price. It's the only place around when touring the dam so where else you gonna eat?"}
{"text":"This was an awful experience!! We waited for over 35 minutes for our food and had to make a decision to either miss our bus or get a refund and not eat!!! We opted for the refund of which we could get all but the tip back. Tip, like they deserved a tip!! This was horrible management and planning on the manager's part...two cooks, really, for thousands of people who circulate through the Hoover Dam, and have no other options to eat?!!!! Awful!!! I can't say that enough!!"}
{"text":"Well I earned the sticker \"I ate the DAM DOG at Hoover Dam\", which they gave me when I ordered their 1/2 # hot dog.  I really shouldn't have ordered this monster, but I had to see what it was like.  Well at $9.99 this is the most expensive single dog I've ordered & I'm kinda of a hot dog nut.  I didn't realize it came on a bed of pretty good fries.  So the price was a little easier to digest, but only a little bit.  The actual dog looked like the Miller brand \"Colossal\", but the taste was actually much better than the Miller.  I don't know what brand dog they use here.  It was prepared on one of those rolling hot dog cookers, but finished off by a cook on a grill, which I stood in front of & watched.  Everything on their menu & in the drink fridges, was overpriced.  At the least the hot dog tasted great.  My son loved his chicken strips & fries, keeping with his traditional dining fare.  My daughter horked on the fries.  Well they do get you in the wallet since the High Scaler is the only place to eat in the area.  I suppose they have to pay for all the added post 9-11 security to protect the Dam from the enemy.  I recall not about 15+ years ago or so (pre 9-11) the dam tour cost about  $1.50, now it was $11 per adult, $8 for kids.  More post 9-11 security expense...  Anyway if you're a hot dog fan, definitely give the Dam Hot Dog a try after you tour the dam.  Just walk back & forth across the dam a few times to burn off the excess calories & fat.  It did taste good tho!  Try to arrive for the early 0900 or 0930 tours.  After that it looks like everyone shows up."}
{"text":"There are not a lot of food options when you go on a bus tour of the dam. So you basically have to grab something here if you weren't prepared ahead of time.  Now it was a good foot long Dam hot dog with a large amount of fries.   But the price??   Overall, it was the best Dam dog I've ever had.  Lol  you know what I meant!   I would go again...   But is nothing to write home about.    The worst part is,  I did not get my sticker saying I ate the Dam dog. :-)   The service was pretty quick knowing how many they put out.   And we were able to make our bus in time to go back to Vegas.   You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Being the only business around the Hoover Dam, this place was super busy. My boyfriend and I were super hungry from not eating breakfast and heading straight to the dam, so we decided to grab a bite to eat. The food is very overpriced as expected, being in a touristy area like this. Our food was okay. We ordered the chicken strips that came with a side of fries, and we ordered an extra side of fries; the total came out to be almost $20. The fries were just cheap frozen bags of fries that anyone can get at a grocery store. The chicken was very thin like the took a meat tenderizer and smashed the heck out of it.  The inside of the cafe was crowded, but there was seating outside with umbrellas so it wasn't bad. The cashier that took our food order was nice too. The menu was next to her register, and they have stickers covering up the old prices. All the pictures on here of the menu had old prices. Once we were at the cafe, we saw that everything was about a dollar more."}
{"text":"Very cool cafe....yes after doing the power plant tour of the dam and walking outside into the 110F unbelievable oppressive heat on July 4th,2017 we couldn't get inside this heavily air conditioned cafe quick enough. It was lovely! We picked up some ice cold bottles of water and a couple of sandwich wraps....and 2 beautiful tasting ice-creams.Real quick service,good food and reasonable prices.Just loved the chilly air con."}
{"text":"We arrived at High Scaler at 4:00PM on a Thursday in June.  The grill / kitchen was closed.  Our only options for food were the pre-made items that they had available in the cold case.  What we got was a dry turkey sandwich on stale bread for $9.99 (plus tax, of course)!  I'm talking about a $3 gas station sandwich... only the ones you get at the gas station have cheese!  This was an absolutely horrid sandwich and the price was a violation.   Completely ruined our Hoover Dam experience.  My new wife and I spent a week in Vegas for our honeymoon and this was absolutely the low point.  Do not let this place take advantage of you like they did us."}
{"text":"This area isn't particularly known for seafood, but I suppose the Colorado River underneath helps. Crispy, hot & fresh, steamy on the inside, golden brown fish and chips--definitely grab these with some tartar sauce over the boring chicken finger basket. Very impressed with this little nook, despite it being a tourist trap."}
{"text":"If you go the Hoover Dam really hungry, this place would earn five stars as it is the ONLY place to eat for miles.  The next closest option is the Hacienda Hotel and Casino about 10 miles away with their 99 cent shrimp cocktails.  Ouch.  Truth be told, the food isn't bad at all.  I had a grilled ham and cheese sandwich with fries and it tasted fine.  Kinda hard to mess that up.  Prices were high, but not as bad as they could have been given the circumstances.  There is indoor and outdoor seating.  It was nice and cold inside, which is a novelty on 100+ degree days.  The line was a bit long when we were there, but moved quickly."}
{"text":"Came in over a packed presidents day weekend. Despite the remote location, the cafe has a sizeable menu of serviceable food options, and even outdoor seating. Friendly, if not fast, service. The cafe is in real need of an expansion to serve the throngs of tourists that flock to the dam. Unfortunately space on the dam is quite limited, so there is no immediately clear solution."}
{"text":"The food was ok. The staff were fairly nice but seemed kinda apathetic. Probably worth the drive into boulder city for better food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I made the mistake of not stopping to eat before I got here. I shared a cheese dam burger. Funny how the food here had Dam in it. Loved it!  Luckily at 12pm there was not much of a line. After ordering you wait for your order to come out from the grill unless you get an item from the fridge (salads, wraps,etc). We stood up and a couple offered their table. We thanked them. There are not many tables to sit at inside and they did have more tables outside to sit at. I wanted to sit indoor since it was so hot out there. I enjoyed the air conditioning.   The cheeseburger was decent and so were the fries. You can't beat the convenience of having this place here. I agree with the other reviews the prices may be high."}
{"text":"I'd be Dam-ned if I passed up a place like this for a Short Lunch. Halfway through our trip, instead of going to the Grand Canyon we decided to drive 40 minutes to go to the Hoover Dam (I didn't see Clark Griswold climbing on it). The place has got like a High School Cafeteria feeling to it, we just order our Food, they give us a Number then when the Food is ready. After picking out Souvenirs for the Family we decided to get a bite to eat.  I got the Dam Dog (this thing was freakin Big), It was 1/2 Pound Weenie made from Beef & Pork. I ate it with no condiments whatsoever, with every bite I took those juices kept dripping down my Chin. It was so big I couldn't finish it (maybe I shouldn't have eaten those Fries). It was a Valiant effort and a Dam good one at that.  Nathan got a Quesadilla with Rice and Refried Beans (Nathan enjoyed the Quesadilla very well, picked it up like a Sandwich and ate it in just a few Bites, he said that the Rice was ok, One Dimensional in Flavor. He said there was no way that he was gonna touch those Refried Beans, says they'll mess up his Stomach).  Its not a 5 Star Gourmet Restaurant (far from it) its got that Greasy Spoon feel to it. Next time I visit I'm gonna get a Damn Burger."}
{"text":"Just your typical, over-priced Hoover Dam Cafe. Nothing much special here. Just your regular faire of food - salad, hamburgers, hotdogs, deserts, etc. It's OK if you need something to eat before you trek back to your Vegas hotel."}
{"text":"Truck stop food...over priced and underwhelming. But super nice employees. Large outdoor patio but seating inside is quite cramped.  Lines moved slow but I'm sure when their's not a crowd, it's manageable.  I've definitely had worse."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst place to buy anything, sooooo over priced.  Kids wanted an ice cream, they want $5 for a cheep no name blue bunny ice cream bar that you can but from a neiborhood ice cream truck for $1.  Customer service is non existence and the few that are working, don't care about the customers at all.  Dont waste your time, enjoy a walk on the Dam or bridge instead!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This cafe is conveniently located right outside the parking garage for the Hoover Dam. Considering they are the only place around for miles it is very nice. Once inside there is a small gift shop where I purchased some post cards to mail to family back home. Than I quickly went to the cafe portion and got on line for a bottled water to go. The line moved quickly and the water is well priced considering we are in the middle of no where and part desert they could charge you anything but they don't.   Needed to get in and out quickly as we were on schedule. So much to do and so little time. I would definitely make a stop here again if I was in the neighborhood as I said not much choice around and they have the essentials of what ypu need if you are driving through or visiting the Hoover Dam."}
{"text":"Decent burgers/dogs and fries.  Iced cream.  Fast counter service.  Nothing special.  Plenty of seating inside and out."}
{"text":"I never realized there was a cafe at the Hoover Dam. This place was packed and I was a little nervous trying their food but it was pretty good. The food was delicious and the prices were reasonable because of the portions of the food. I got a Dam Dog 1/2 lb, buffalo chili fries, and a breakfast burrito (egg, cheese, ham, and bacon). They were all delicious."}
{"text":"While visiting Hoover Dam I stopped here for a bite to eat.  This was the absolute WORST Philly Cheesesteak sandwich I've ever had in my entire life, completely inedible - $12.99 plus tax to add insult to injury.  Just look at the picture, you can tell!  Greasy, burnt, thin unflavored meat with chunks of peppers, an onion or two, very little cheese, no mayo or ketchup.  I took a small bite of the meat and it was totally disgusting, my husband took a bite and his face told it all...it took us a few minutes of eating other stuff to get the burnt taste out of our mouth.  The fries were mediocre at best."}
