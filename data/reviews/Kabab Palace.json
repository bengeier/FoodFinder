{"text":"I am big fan to this place since 2011. Chicken biryani is great. Mango custard is awesome. Goat curry was ok."}
{"text":"This place actually serves pretty good North and South Indian food, which is no small feat. The dosas and utthapam are good and the lamb dishes, chicken, and other veg curry dishes are delish too. Sambar is tangy and chili hot which i love.  If you've never had dosas or other South Indian dishes, this is a good place to try them. Indian cuisine is soooo much more than tandoori chicken and naan."}
{"text":"Warning!  This place is no longer Afghan food.  It is now an Indian restaurant with both North and South Indian dishes.    My husband and I were very disappointed as we loved the Afghan food there.  Apparently the change came about 12 days ago, so it's very new.  We thought it might just be another Indian food experience, but it was amazingly good Indian food.  We've tried many Indian restaurants (including Guru Palace and The Dhaba) in the Tempe and Mesa areas and this was the best we've had.    We started our meal with veggie samosas which were good.  We then had a long wait for our main dishes, but the waitress kept our drinks filled and apologized for the wait (this is one thing that could be improved).  But then, when we got our dishes, we were blown away.  We ordered the ginger lamb curry and the Malai Kofta both a la carte style which comes with rice and plain naan included (a helpful change from most restaurants where you order that extra).  The ginger lamb curry was tasty with lots of ginger and very tender lamb.  The Malai Kofta was very good with a wonderful sauce.  Their naan was excellent - very fluffy - some of the best we've had in town.  The rice was seasoned a little bit too, which is nice.  We used that naan to clean out our bowls and might have licked the plate if we hadn't been in public.    We can't wait to go back and try more of the dishes.  We could see dosas being served at other tables and they looked very large and good.   They also have a lunch buffet and we want to go try that too.  All in all, I'm sad to not have an Afghan restaurant around anymore, but their Indian dishes were wonderful!    The prices were just over $10 for a la carte entrees, but that does include the rice and naan.  With appetizer and one drink, our dinner for two was just about $30."}
{"text":"Their lunch buffet is really good. I would definitely recommend it.  Would be returning there soon."}
{"text":"I can't help but like this place. Good food, for buffet style food.The service is good the tea is fresh, the price is right. I just wish they offered a discount for kids."}
{"text":"We loved it.  I knew nothing of Afghani cuisine and the owner took the opportunity to help us work our way through the menu and the results were amazing.  The spices, the flavors and the aroma of the restaurant was absolutely amazing.    It was certainly a culinary adventure and not only was it a delightful adventure, it was also very educational.  Rock solid service, indescribably delicious food and if I could give the restaurant six stars, I certainly would."}
{"text":"Had the lunch buffet here today. The food was ok but was disappointing compared to the reviews here. Do note that this is no longer a middle eastern joint, unlike the name suggests."}
{"text":"I was craving for indian good very badly and kabab place is actually not too far from my place. I ordered chicken tikka masala, and samosa .. For pick up, and omg .. Chicken tikka masala was great and chicken was tender , and samosa was nice and fresh . Great food all together .."}
{"text":"I've been for both the buffet (weekdays, and always before noon) and to pick up food for takeout, and both are excellent.  The buffet is fresh, and items change regularly - probably the best buffet of any type of food I have been to.  Amazing bread, friendly service, fun Indian music videos on the tv."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Indian restaurant in Phoenix so far.  (And believe me, I've tried quite a few.)  I have had the lunch buffet here and dinner entrees.  The lunch buffet had a good variety and everything was tasty.  Typical Indian buffet, but done well.  For dinner, I first had to try my standard chicken tikka masala which was creamy with good flavor.  The tandoori chicken was very tender.  Naan was good as well.  Nothing special about the inside of the restaurant.  It just made the top of my list because I like the food the most."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday afternoon (Saturday).  The place was busy but I don't know why.  This is an Indian food restaurant (I think it used to be an Afghan restaurant).  We had the buffet which was $15 and the food was terrible!  The tandoori chicken was powdery dry and COLD.  It was not kept at a safe temperature on the line.  Most of the dishes were too salty to enjoy and a couple of them used too much cardamom.  One dal was okay but tasted more like the Tasty Bite brand purchased in a cardboard box at the grocery store.  They had a mango pudding that was definitely instant (I had enough instant pudding growing up that I'm sure of it).  They didn't have any Palak Paneer or Gulab Jamun , which was disappointing - but it probably wouldn't have been any good anyway.   The d√©cor was bleak with ugly dated chandeliers and water stained ceiling tiles.  The restrooms were also in poor repair.   I love Indian food but this place was no good."}
{"text":"Food is good and fresh..better than almost 90% of the restaurants in and around Tempe,AZ. I just have one complaint that their Tandoori chicken is really pricey."}
{"text":"I went here on Friday and had a very nice dinner food was wonderful but I do have one concern, I had wonderful service from the only 3 people on the waitstaff who were taking care of a restaurant full of about 75 people completely packed. They took care of my wife, daughter, and I like we were the only people there which was amazing for there being so many people (One table was a party of about 20). I had such wonderful service all night and decided to leave a tip making sure to leave enough for all 3 on my card. When I told one of the wait staff they informed me that they do not receive tips and that they all go to the \"Company\". I was shocked that for what a wonderful job they seem to be doing do not receive tips for it. Needless to say I will have a talk with the owner next time I stop in. Please be aware that the waitstaff does not receive tips."}
{"text":"This place used to be one of the few good Indian restaurants in the Valley, but not any more. I made two visits here in the past 3 months - once for dinner and once for the weekend buffet. Both times the food was below par. There were a few items that were tasty, but when you pay around $13-14 for a buffet, you expect more than just 2-3 items to taste good. They only allow you to order either a dosa or a naan with the buffet which isn't great since the food that you can try then becomes limited. I will not be going there again."}
{"text":"Food is always good here. Customer service is really bad. They made me sit for 30 mins in restaurant to pick up food for which I already ordered through phone and arrived to restaurant 10 mins thinking food is ready (wait time gave for me on phone). That's really bad customer service ."}
{"text":"Food: good Service: pathetic   We went with group of friends on saturday afternoon for lunch buffet. We were waiting for server to show up..but no one did..and finally we had to go and ask server (who was the owner) to come to our table.   Most of items in buffet were empty and it was after very long wait (over 20 min) that they refilled it.   One of my friend's kid crashed against the owner who was carrying drinks. The lady almost screened at our table and was rude. She came by yelling to take care of kid. Seriously !!!   (i understand my friend should have been more attentive with the kid but that doesnt qualify for being rude to customer)"}
{"text":"I was really surprised! I have passed by this location thousands of times, and I am so happy I finally stopped by for dinner. I ordered the fried spinach appetizer and butter chicken a la carte. The spinach appetizer is addicting! Nothing like I expected. In fact, better than expected and I will probably order it every time I go now. The butter chicken was something I have never tasted before. Flavorful, with a great consistency and texture. Their naan is the best I have ever had. Sooo fluffy and moist. PLUS, the place is beautiful inside. Totally blew me away. The bollywood music added a quirky touch to the atmosphere. MmmM!"}
{"text":"Ginger chicken was very good and liked the boti lamb even though it was not fully cooked as per Indian expectations .. They do have a thali option with the lunch and dinner orders which is nice . Biriyani was pretty average"}
{"text":"Horrible food and the most horrible service ever experience, will never ever waste my money again in this restaurant,"}
{"text":"I've only been here for the lunch buffet, and I though it was above average.  The kufta kabob was prepared in a way that I'm not used to but it was good, if not just a little over-seasoned.  The chicken kabob was good, but very dry.  I don't remember the names of the other dishes I tried, but there were a couple of very good ones, including a rice pudding desert.  I suspect the quality of the meats served at dinner is far superior to the lunch buffet...but I can't say for sure, and the buffet wasn't enough of an enticement for me to really want to go there for dinner.  It's in an office-like strip mall, so they didn't have a lot to work with.  Once you get inside, though, they've done a good enough job with the decor.    I try to support local mom-and-pop establishments as much as I can...but this one's just not my thing."}
{"text":"All I remember of this place is a glum-faced family acting as greeters, waiters, cashiers and probably as the chefs. I don't know whether they were having a bad day or we went there at a bad time (Sunday dinner) but this experience was probably the worst that I have had in the valley.   The Mourgh Challow was good but the Koufta Challow was in no way pleasing to the palate. The baklava was cold and as hard as stone. When we couldn't finish the food and asked for boxes, they handed us only ONE box for both the rice and the gravy. I was quite startled by this move...   The enthusiasm that I had built up about this place after reading all the glorifying reviews has been dampened by the horrible service that we received in an empty restaurant with average food. However, instead of swearing by this one-time experience I am still prepared to give them the benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"This use to be one of my favorite Indian Food Restaurants in AZ. Sadly, things have gone a bit south, in my opinion. 3 Of my last 4 visits have resulted in major disappointment. 1st was the DNA sample (dyed hair) I found in my food. 2nd was goats hair in my goat curry and 3rd was a cockroach on the table (hidden in the napkin and very much alive). I did not report the first incident but did the second. In their defense, their customer service was great and I was given a free meal (I insisted on paying and emphasized that I was not looking for a free meal but the manager insisted it be a free). My friend and I did not report the 3rd issue but decided that we will not go back. Hygiene issues of this nature simply ruins a great meal. One incident I could possibly live with....but three? Too much to stomach."}
{"text":"Not so friendly staff  The food was fine in the buffet  But try the mango custard  is very  delicious  The thing which I didn't like when I payed for buffet , they charged and accounted my son who is 3 years"}
{"text":"Great buffet, Good ambiance .  Fantastic Dessert options. Will definitely go back :)"}
{"text":"I have been to many Afghan restaurants in the bay area and have often been disappointed when i goto new restaurants with \"afghan\" cuisine. I really enjoy afghan food and found this place to be of very good quality and I thought the environment was very pleasant and the food was very tasty."}
{"text":"i haven't reviewed many indian restaurants in phoenix, but have eaten at quite a few, at least 10. kebab palace had the best indian food i've eaten in the phoenix area for a long while. most indian restaurants i've tried are three and and a half to four stars from my perspective, but three and a half is typical. usually an indian restaurant is great in a couple areas, and one thing at least is detrimentally lacking, such as spiciness or service. usually, my displeasure especially increases as spiciness decreases (like at flavors of india). it's been a while since i tried kebab palace, so i can't actually remember specifically most of what i ate at their buffet, but i do remember (and can't forget!) that the food was actually spicy and flavorful and hot (in terms of temperature). wow! spicy indian food served hot like it should be, and a large interesting selection of vegetarian options (i usually eat vegetarian when going out to eat). i felt slightly impartial to the decor, too. madras blue walls and chandeliers, with bollywood films showing on the flatscreen."}
{"text":"Horrible food and horrible management. Took my family out with 8 people and the management just got panicked as they never attended so many people. There was no clarity on the menu and choices to make.  If 2 people are going to eat better order 4 dish as the quantities are like nothing. Horrible place.. save money and better eat at taco bell."}
{"text":"I love this little gem.  The owner is a lovely Afghani man who is friendly and helpful.  This was important because he made many wonderful suggestions to us, the uninitiated.  The Morgh Challow (which is a chicken curry style dish with rice )is the best thing on the menu, although the Mantwo is my husband's favorite.    If you have never tried Afghani, then you are missing out, and if you have, ben have missed Kabab Palace, then you are missing out as well.  I promise that both the service and the food will leave you smiling.  I have been there both for the lunch buffet, which was excellent (my husband kept going back, which was embarrassing to me but tells you something about the food) and the dinner.  I would recommend either, although the lunch buffet would be a better way to try Afghani food for the first time, as you can try a bit of everything and find what you like best."}
{"text":"I got an order of seekh kabob last night to go, and not only was it a rip off, but it was by far the worst food I've had in my life. It was $16 for 2 kabob cut into 2 pieces and this was probably x2 the price for kabob as compared to any other restaurant. The meat was raw and you could smell the disgusting scent of raw meat. It looked raw and when I tasted it it was slimy and cold. Even though this is the most convenient Indian restaurant for me, I will never be going here again."}
{"text":"Food quality has gone downhill a bit from last few years.  The owner  has bad attitude and not customer friendly.  Expect $7 for 2 year old baby food if you give samplers during the buffet. Apparently it is the kids buffet price. We will stick to other places in the valley."}
{"text":"ordered biryani for to go and it is a rip off for $60+tax half tray.  The owner and kids at the counter seems to show no care about their customers.  my hands are full with take away but no one bother to open door while going back and watching me to struggle opening the door"}
{"text":"I have a new favorite restaurant and it is named Kabab Palace.    Ok, so I was expecting your typical Middle Eastern fare.  I was pleasantly surprised.  All of the food was outstanding.  The afgani ravioli (aushak) was especially delicious, if I go back I will probably order it as my entree.  The server and everyone else there was so nice and so helpful.  I want to go back and try the buffet but I'm afraid it can't compare to the amazing dinner I had there with friends.  I wish I was closer to this restaurant so I could eat here more often!"}
{"text":"My husbean and I have gone here twice, and both times the food was amazing. The second time we went, the owner and his daughter both recognized us even though it had been a month or two. I always end up with leftovers for the next day, and the cilantro chutney they serve with the bread is so yummy.  The last time we went, it was rather busy, but the service was still great. Both the owner and his daughter are incredibly friendly and willing to answer whatever questions about the food you have (such as what halal means, what makes meat halal, etc). The Turkish coffee is really good, as well."}
{"text":"Totally miss the Afghan cuisine and the nice owners who hosted an absolutely awesome birthday party for friends and family, they were 5star.  However, the new buffet is tasty and gets a large lunch crowd. Good options for the vegans in the group, although I like the desserts and naan at Star of India (Ahwatukee) best."}
{"text":"Was really good, went with no expectation was surprised finally. The sweets, poori, dosa idly, curd rice, chicken 65 everything were awesome. The sambar could have been better, overall the food was awesome. Last but not least the service was really good, they were nice. I would suggest this place to friends."}
{"text":"Kabab Palace is one of the few Indian restaurants with good flavors. Their buffet menu is pretty good and every time I bring in someone new to AZ to this place, they leave feeling satisfied. Definitely recommend their buffet so you can try the various preparations and pick which you like the best next time you come!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, very authentic. Loved the samosas. Being affordable was the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"Friendly Owners, 100% family run, food is great, the portions are adequate, unlike most indian restaurants that try to hoodwink you by giving you small portions, their buffet is exceptional, lots of choices....and the food is delicious.  Best of all, you get south indian as well as north indian delicacies...must visit and if you see a school kid as your waiter, give him a good tip..he is saving for his college education."}
{"text":"We have tried this place few times. But we like it very much on Friday night dinner. I think they make fresh biryanis on fridays since most people goes for dinner on fridays. We have had fresh and aromatic goat biryani, chicken 65 & chilli chicken on Friday night dinner times. The food is so delicious on Fridays. We have tried dinner on Saturday, but it didn't look fresh.  I prefer this place only on Fridays for dinner. I will try again on other days and keep you posted if it looks good. The rates are bit costly. Biryani is almost $14, which is so costly."}
{"text":"Bad. Need to improve on customer satisfaction and hospitality . food and option are good but the other one makes me not go to same place again. But I still love the option what they have for lunch buffet."}
{"text":"I visited this place today.. I saw no pieces in the Hyderabadi Dhum Mutton Biryani.. They could have named it Just Biryani  Rice instead.. The manager over there was a lady.. When we told her about that, she was like we can't maintain a even balance between the rice and the pieces.. Lol.. Then why do u maintain a restaurant.. Dumb lady..it's not the way you treat you're customers.."}
{"text":"One star since thats the least we could give. Not worth one penny of your money. They dont treat their staff well nor does the tip go to the staff. Unhygienic conditions. Over pricey. Food not matching the value. Most of all. the owner lady and her son, are extremely unprofessional. Lot of things need to be fixed to earn a good review and customer satisfaction.

These guys are cheaters. The owner lady, and her son. And this restaurant does not deserve to run its business. They charged twice the amount for my purchase and they refused to pay me back the money I paid in extra. Cheater business. Just dont go here."}
{"text":"I was having a party and ordered 5 chicken and 5 goat biryani. I am from hyderabad and was not expecting at that level but the biryani sucked. It was the worst biryani even. Will never buy here...."}
{"text":"Love this Indian. Trying to find a good Indian for ages, have eaten some awful food in pursuit. The food here is great and reasonably priced, decor could be better but when the food is good who cares. The butter chicken is particularly yummy!"}
{"text":"Favorite Indian food around!  Love that they have vegan options! Always enjoy my meal and enjoy trying different dishes.  Their samosas are a bit spicier then some other places but really yummy.  I love that they have vegan options too."}
{"text":"The customer service and wait time for food is absolutely horrible, but let me tell you every minute I waited and twiddled my thumbs and watched the music videos on the tv they have by the entrance was well worth it. I had one of the best dosas I have ever had here. I have lived in chicago and los angles, and the cook who made my dosa shall get my business very often. I hope to shake his hand. I do wish the service and wait time would improve, but why compromise the quality of food. I will wait as long as you want me to."}
{"text":"I first encountered Kabab Palace's chef's food back at Woodlands in Chandler, and fell in love with the rich flavors, diverse menu, and excellent pricing. The move to Kabab Palace and the addition of meat dishes to the menu enhanced the excellence of this establishment."}
{"text":"I tried this place once on a whim as carry out, not sure what the menu name of dish but the description said yogurt chicken also came with fresh naan....ohh my yumminess very spicy and flavorful!  Felt I really scored with this whimsy adventure.  Took me awhile but made it back twice for the lunch buffet and have been very pleased with the selection.  Even though my carry-out and lunch buffet both good experiences I have and will definitely recommend the lunch buffet because if I hadn't gone for buffet wouldn't of discovered they had SO many delicious items available!  The place is clean and blue..lol and the service friendly yet a bit stale.  I do plan on going back again soon:)"}
{"text":"They have improved a lot from the last time I visited , would highly recommend this place for lunch buffet"}
{"text":"Service was slow and ignoring the people who came first and serving the people came after us"}
{"text":"Gratuity is mandatory here even for buffet!! This is what this Indian place made us realize!!!! Food is decent but service isnt and the lady at the cashier (Sujata) basically forced us to pay gratuity! Not that we wouldnt pay but literally questioned it because it was buffet. Anyway...we wont be going here as: - No kabob's were served on our buffet trip - Food was decent but not necessarily better than other Indian places. - Sujata was more interested in gratuity which she basically forced us to pay even though we objected.  Will never go here again!!!!"}
{"text":"Although I have been to this restaurant quite a few times, I was very impressed with how they accommodated our group of 10 without any hassle! For a group setting near by ASU(college campus) in Tempe, the food is great and the atmosphere is very relaxed! We ordered a number of dishes but I really enjoyed the zesty chicken manchurian and biryani as I usually order these dishes! Aside from these courses, I enjoyed the shrimp curry and butter chicken side items as well for the generous serving of thali! Also SAVE ROOM FOR DESERT BECAUSE THE lassis, kulfi, ice cream etc are worth the post-meal scrumptuousness! I plan to come back in the future and give the lamb-based dishes a try in the near future and optimally check out the popular lunch buffet option!"}
{"text":"Wow. Really great indian food.   I had the goat currey. It was so melt-in-the-mouth good. And it was nicely spiced.  The garlic naan was very tasty.  If the buffet is anything like the dinner I will be back.  I saw a lot of Indians there too, so it has to be authentic and good."}
{"text":"Great Indian food is hard to find so close to home! The staff is very friendly, she recommended the Dahl and I'm so glad I got that! It was delicious! The rice was good too, nice and fluffy. Definitely try the Dahl if you go here- I'll be back just for that!"}
{"text":"Well, I  came to eat here with a group. The service was very slow. and the food didnt come to my table until it was 45 mins later. Also, the food was really awful. Way too much salt and not tasty at all. I dont recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Love Love Love their Lamb/Goat Rogan Josh..it is simply the best !!! Their Naan's are really good as well. Recently got food catered from them for a small ( 40 Ppl ) event and loved samosa Chaat for appetizer , Vegetable Biryani for Entree and Carrot Halwa for the desert the most."}
{"text":"the food was mediocre, service was not good.   go to the dhaba instead. you'll be happy."}
{"text":"I am from south India and I can say that this place is as authentic as it gets. Food taste is consistent every time I go. I love their dum biryani."}
{"text":"Love it, love it, love it.  My husband took me here for my birthday dinner, as we'd been wanting to try this place since it opened. I haven't had the opportunity to eat Afghani food since college, and so I was really excited.  Kabab Palace didn't disappoint.  First, it's adorable, decorated with blue walls, chandeliers and Afghan art. Secondly, they offered a vegetarian section in their menu (it's always nice when they do that, as it shows me the veg food is more than just an afterthought). We ordered the vegetarian ashauk for an appetizer, which was thin \"dumplings\" stuffed with leeks and covered in veggies and yogurt. It was tasty.  I then ordered a vegetable special, which was amazing! Stewed spinach with a hint of cinnamon, crispy roasted eggplant with yogurt and tomato, an okra sample and sugar-coated pumpkin roasted and topped with yogurt -- all of it came with a rice pulao.  By the way, that eggplant was possibly the best eggplant I've had in my entire life. My husband ordered the sheekh kebab and said it was very good, too. For dessert, we ordered turkish coffee, which was just OK, but it came in adorable china cups and saucers. They also served tea, beer and wine, as well as various juices. The service was very attentive, and the owner was friendly. The restaurant was almost empty around 8 p.m., but I hope business picks up -- I know we'll definitely be back for the high-quality and unique food."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today with Rand H at this great east indian buffet , there is new owners in the place and they have been there for about a year now. The food is still some of the best indian food you will find in the valley. Everything i ate from the lentil soup , lamb , goat , tandoori chicken ,naan , lots of veggie dishes were all delicious and for dessert they had a mixed fruit mango custard that is real good , so good they serve it everyday because it is so popular. The restaurant itself is clean and nicely decorated and the staff are very friendly and helpful. I would strongly recommend this place to anyone wanting good east indian food.                   yumm  yumm   yummm"}
{"text":"Clean place and for me it is a must   Very accommodating   Thanks for the chile and the onions appreciate that"}
{"text":"best chicken biryani i have ever had.. so full of spice, they don't hold back! 12.99 buffet.... great place to go before a costco run lol"}
{"text":"I've been here twice for the lunch buffet and have been impressed with the selection and the freshness of the food.  Everything I tried was wonderfully flavored and the prices are quite reasonable too."}
{"text":"The food didn't agree with my wife after 1/2 a plate. I asked to pay for my one plate of the buffet and the help got the manager. The manager complained to me, \"if you eat you should pay!\" then said \"in her custom first customer is important and that I wished them bad luck\". We will never return and also tell our friends and coworkers."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  The service is GREAT, I never had less than a half full glass of water.  I am a vegetarian, and the three other people I dined with are not, and for the pumpkin appetizer, they put the meat in a separate dish for the meat eaters.  It's just nice.  The place oozes kindness and helpfulness.  I'm not sure if the food is authentic, but it is really REALLY good and the service is so kind and helpful."}
{"text":"In light of the whole Amy's Baking Company not allowing their servers to keep their tips, I thought it would interest Yelp to know, that one of the servers at Kabab Palace  told us to leave her tip in cash because they were not allowed to keep their tips. Yeah, the owners don't allow their servers to keep their tips."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Food was stale. Service was annoying slow. When we found an aluminum piece in one of the dishes they offered no apologies and then just proceeded to replace the dish. Don't think they care about the consequences of such an incident. Highly advice ppl to not visit this place."}
{"text":"I have actually been to Kabab palace a few times now--mostly to humor my family, since they have been partial in the past.  However, today's experience tipped me over the edge.  We decided to come here for my birthday and the service was beyond poor.  Our party of 7 was the only group in the restaurant for the majority of our time there, and each dish came out one by one, about 10 minutes apart; the first person got their food and finished before the last person even received their food. The plates that they gave for appetizers were dirty. The water was not iced and tasted very stale.  The sambhar tasted like it had been sitting all day. The paneer dosa that I ordered was tasty and the right level of spice, but was overcooked. Overall, I would like to say that I have given this restaurant one too many chances.  Needless to say, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a lunch buffet when you are in the mood for Indian food.  The food selection at the bar is really good, and they keep everything very fresh and clean.  All the selections I've had from the buffet are very tasty and probably the best quality I've eaten at a buffet.  I also like that they bring fresh hot baked Bhatura (bread) to your table.  The bread is to die for!  Of course, they also have salad and dessert too, which also tasted very good.  The prices aren't cheap, but not bad either.  I usually pay ~$15 by the time I get a lunch buffet, drink, and good tip."}
{"text":"Craving some authentic Indian food. The chicken biryani hit the spot. Gulab jamun was ok. Definitely coming back for more. I ordered to go and was skeptical on coming here because of the other reviews. Glad I tried it since it's right in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Lovely restaurant with attentive and pleasant staff. The mutter paneer was perfectly seasoned and the paneer flavorful. Ordered some garlic nan and it came out steaming and topped with plenty of fresh roasted garlic and butter. The helpings are enormous, so bring your appetite. The friends we came with have been to the lunch buffet often and were gushing with complements."}
{"text":"First let me clear up one thing, some people have written that this restaurant serves BOTH Indian and Middle Eastern (kabab) food.  It does not.  It was a kabab place until 6 months ago when the ownership changed, its now SOLELY Indian food.  I guess they're too cheap or too lazy to change the name or sign... which i actually find really endearing.    This is easily the best Indian food I've ever had, and I'm from the Bay Area where we have a very substantial Indian population.  Even my boyfriend, whose prior idea of exotic food was Filibertos (no I'm not kidding) LOVED the food here.  I had chana masala (chickpeas) which was insane, spicy and savory and completely flawless, and my boyfriend had the biriyani.  I'm not a fan of biriyani in general but this one was pretty good. Just a warning, you'll be picking full cardamom pods and whole cloves out of your mouth -- but whatever works to get the flavor so nice!  You can order your meal \" thali\" which means with 5 small side dishes for just a couple of bucks more, so we got to taste the dal (lentils), a soup, the aloo gobi (cauliflower), an incredible eggplant dish, naan and a tiny dessert.  I dont remember what the dessert was called but it was some kind of cardamom syrup soaked fried flour ball -- was delicious. I've been disgusted by that dessert at other restaurants but LOVED it at kabab palace. FYI, we didn't mention anything at all about level of spicyness and our meal definitely came spicy enough to make our noses run...charming, right?  so if you can't handle heat i'd suggest mentioning that you'd like it mild.   When all was said and done, our bill came to $25 bucks, and we had at LEAST half of what we ordered to bring home.  Next time we'll order only one \"Thali\" meal to split and still eat well.  All in all, the best indian meal i've ever had, and enough to convert my 'merican-cheese loving boyfriend."}
{"text":"This place is great! We thought that we were going back to the Afghan restaurant, but found out that it had changed to an Indian restaurant once we were already through the door. We decided to give it a try. The food was AMAZING! Really, really good northern and southern Indian food. We ordered the Palak Paneer, the Chole, and the okra (forget the name). Each dish was delicious! The Palak Paneer is normally a pretty bland dish, but it was surprisingly (and deliciously) spicy! The okra had a nice spice as well. I couldn't stop eating it! We also ordered one of the chaat appetizers. It was unlike anything that I've had before, which is always a great treat because I've had a lot of Indian food. I have only just recently discovered chaat dishes and I've never seen them in a sit down restaurant. Neat!  We were really happy that the curries came with plentiful rice AND naan bread (you usually have to order bread separately). The atmosphere of the restaurant is really pleasant and a little up-scale. The bathrooms are ehhh, but not awful. The owner came over afterwards to see how we liked the meal, which is always a nice touch. The server was a little new at the job and wasn't able to answer our questions fully. However, she looked like she had just started and needed more time to learn the ropes.  Overall, a really wonderful surprise! One of the best Indian restaurants in Phoenix."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars.   Great food! But the staff is still a little new and seem to be getting the hang of things under their new owner. The cuisine is Northern and Southern Indian, definitely not Middle Eastern. The servers were very nice, but were not the best at judging when you were done eating and they tried to take our plates away mid-meal.  I wasn't sure why that kept happening.  Nonetheless, she made some great recommendations for dinner. The chicken 65 appetizer is delicious: crispy spicy chicken. Mmm."}
{"text":"I've experience something of an about-face on this place.  I don't know if the food has gotten better, or my tastes have changed, but now, when I go, I find at least three or four dishes I really like.  Curry goat?  Yes, please!  On my first time going back in almost a year, they had the most warm, moist, delicious gulab jamon (probably butchered the spelling there) I've ever had.  Now I have cravings for those tasty little balls (I'll let you come up with your own punchline)."}
{"text":"Oh man do I LOVE THIS PLACE!  Their food is SO good, and so are their prices!  The first time I went I had never had Afghan food and was curious about what it was.  It was \"normal\" foods I had heard of but with spices that are simply WONDERFUL.  If it's your first time I highly recommend the lunch buffet, that way you can taste a little of everything they offer.  Because deciding on a dinner item was difficult, I wanted to try so many of them!  I came back last Dec. with a few girlfriends and we ended up chatting and eating well past when all the other patrons left (oops!).  The owner was so kind and told us to stay as long as we wanted- he chatted with us as well- telling us about his family and moving the restaurant from San Fran to Tempe etc.  I really cannot say enough great things about this place.  JUST GO EAT THERE!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times it's been a great experience.  Don't let the name fool you...It's actually an Indian restaurant not Mediterannean.  Great food and great service.  They do not have a liquor license so they allow customers to bring their own wine to drink.  At most Indian restaurants I've been to usually you have to order the naan or rice a la carte.  Here at Kabab Palace if you order a la carte, you also get plain naan and rice with your entree.  I think it's a smart business practice to do that."}
{"text":"First time going back in awhile obviously.  The service was TERRIBLE.  Very, very bad.  I ordered some eggplant dish and I didn't like it at all.  I usually love eggplant no matter how it is prepared.  I also ordered my dish mild and about burned my mouth off eating it.  Done with this place."}
{"text":"Good Indian food with abundant portions. With an Entertainment Book coupon, it was a bargain."}
{"text":"Read the review from New Times, and thought we'd give it a try. Consensus: best service dining out in a LONG time, crazy-amazing food (just have something with lamb, or eggplant for some real standouts). We lived near the middle-east for a while, and this food definitely had that \"comfort food\" type of feeling for us - and we'd never had Afghan food before. (for reference, we had the kourma challow entree, the banjan & aushak appetizers, bucklawa and sheerbering desserts)  On a different level, as far as we know this place isn't a chain, doesn't relate to some gigantic corporation, etc., so when you go you know you're helping a family-run, local business while also happening to have a phenomenal meal. Seems like a winner to us."}
{"text":"Very nice place. The quality of the food is superb. The Kadai paneer is a little not as it should be. The Burbank is good. Ambience, service and pricing as it should be. Will be back to this place again. Not sure of the dessert."}
{"text":"having grown up eating chinese food and mexican, i feel pretty comfortable going into a new restaurant and ordering certain dishes without much fear and trepidation.  but throw me into a middle eastern cuisine and i'll end up ordering something stupid.  that's why we like going to AYCE when it comes to indian, afghan, middle eastern or mediterannean.  You can try a number of things that you would not have a clue about if you were to order straight off the menu and you can go back for the stuff you like.  i have no clue what we ate, what it was called and couldn't even recognize it again at another restaurant.  but it did taste good (but we don't really know what to compare it to).  like the 1st poster said, the ground beef kabob was so heavy in spice and rich, i nearly tossed my cookies after eating a 2nd helping.  it tasted good in the beginning but by the 8th or 9th piece, i was ready to kiss the porcelain cadillac.  that's what i get for being greedy i suppose.  the chicken breast kabob had a great sauce, but it was dry (as stated by the 1st poster)  For $10/person and lunch, it's a great way to taste different things on the menu w/o having to order 20 items and filing chapter 11 afterwards.  1 thing we noticed is that a ton of people were coming in on Good Friday that seemed to be of the middle eastern persuasian (sometimes a good indicator that the ethnic food is semi-authentic?)  we'll probably return once a year to get our afghan fix  the owner was very nice and talkative, great service"}
{"text":"So I went here for the lunch buffet on Friday. AMAZING! The food was really fresh, seasoned well & cooked to perfection.  Most buffets leave you with dried out pieces of meat but not here. The service was great & we were in and out within our hour allotment. So I figured I must have caught them on a good day. My GF & I just ate there today...again the lunch buffet. Again...AMAZING. The service was just as good, the food was great & they even added a few new items that wasn't there Friday.  At $10.99 for the buffet its a deal. Esp. considering we spend almost $8-$9 on a burger meal at a fast food joint. I really like this place. My coworkers liked this place. Most importantly...my honey liked this place. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I don't really like Indian food to begin with the only reason why I came was because of a staff lunch for work and let me tell you they picked the worst place to have lunch the food was dried the meat was raw and it smelled bad and the service was slow and rude and don't even get me started on the price $15 per person really !!!! not even your typical Asian buffets charge that much probably like the worst restaurant I've spent my money at don't spend your hard earned money here never coming back"}
{"text":"Great buffet but the price does hurt a bit. I dropped about $30 for two at the buffet with out drinks for a Thursday lunch.  In addtion to the normal dishes one would expect there are dosas and even mini batura  The flavors were bold and declious, service was good too.   I would be back but at about $2-5 more than other lunch buffets I probblay may not be for a long time."}
{"text":"I have finally arrived!! The best Indian food I've ever had. When I shared my nut allergy the chef made me a special meal off menu and it is delicious!!"}
{"text":"We have a newly over-rated restaurant to talk about; and it is named Kabab Palace (obviously).   Okay, so we were expecting this pleasantly surprising Middle Eastern cuisine (especially for the asking price). We went for the lunch buffet: the Afghani bread was as dry as a Saltine; and the curry chicken was also as arid as the climate originating from. All-in-all, everything we ate most definitely lacked the wow-factor that everyone seems to be raving about. Including drinks (but lacking tips), the lunch buffet totaled to $30. We will not be returning.   If one would like to experience a tasty buffet at a reasonable price, check out the Taj Mahal (Indian, Pakistani cuisine) in Tempe, off N. Scottsdale Rd (really close to ASU). Only $7.99 with a good spread; the garlic naan bread must be sampled. Oh, and the Indian equivalent of MTV playing in the background is not as loud as some are whinnying about; they are quite ridiculously funny (definitely enjoyable to watch while you eat your enjoyable food)."}
{"text":"I was invited to come to this place on the spur of the moment.  I probably should have declined, but I do like Indian food and I figured I could order off the menu.  Yes, they do have a buffet here, but I hate buffets.  Allow me to digress about buffets briefly.  The first problem with them is that they encourage me to eat too much.  I always want to get my money's worth, so I stuff myself.  Not great.  Second problem is a bit more gross.  Any idea how many people wash their hands after going to the bathroom?  Maybe half?  And here is a row of food trays with utensils being handled by literally dozens of people, half of whom did not wash their hands recently.  And that doesn't include those who may be sick, or recently coughed/sneezed into their hands (without washing afterwards).  And those serving utensils are touching my food??  Uhhh...no.  So I order from the menu (more about the menu in a moment).  I'm not very hungry, so I just order a lentil soup with mixed vegetables in it (Sambar).  The waitress proceeds to the buffet line, grabs a bowl, and ladles the soup from the buffet into the bowl.  There's my sambar.  Served with one of those potentially toxic utensils I just mentioned.  Ugggh!  I wanted it from the kitchen where only one or two people who haven't washed their hands will handle it!!!!  Not cool.  The service itself was inattentive.  They seemed a bit understaffed.  Maybe someone missed work so they were short-handed?  Dunno.  But it was inattentive.  What interaction we did have with the servers was friendly.  The soup was very flavorful, but very lacking in lentils.  I expected to see lentils.  It was mostly broth with a few pieces of vegetable in it.  Disappointing.  And now for the menu...it featured a large variety of dishes.  That bit was good.  But every section that involved meat indicated the meat was halal.  Some argue that halal meat is more humane, but I do not believe that is true.  There are a few brief religious ceremonies/utterances that must be done before slaughtering the animal, but basically they hang it upside down and slit its throat while it's still conscious.  It then bleeds-out (probably at least 20-30 seconds before it passes out).  I do not see how that is more humane than the typical western method of stunning the animal first, then stringing it up and cutting the throat.  There is no suffering in the latter (if it's done properly).  I'm not squeamish about slaughtering an animal for food, and I do know where meat comes from.  The only reason to do it halal is religious, and I have a problem with inducing suffering without very good reason.  Ancient traditions that aren't really relevant to modern hygiene do not qualify in my opinion.  I'm not criticizing others' beliefs, but I do not share them and don't think I should have to partake in them.  They have plenty of vegan dishes, and that's fine.  My soup I believe was vegan.  I do wish she had brought me a fresh one from the kitchen instead of one from the buffet line.  Prices seemed a tad high to me, too.  But the place was busy, and clearly very popular with Indian people (most patrons appeared to be Indian)."}
{"text":"We went there for a buffet an hour before their closing time. The buffet was ok. What was really bad was the service. While we were still eating, the waiter brought out a vacuum cleaner and began cleaning the floor. It was very uncomfortable for us with all the noise the vacuum was making. The owner was right there and she did not seem to care.  We went there for the second time after a few months. The service was again really bad. We had wait every time to get water filled into our glasses. The waiter also had some kind of eye infection. I wonder how they allowed her to work with that.  When I mentioned to the owner about the bad service her response was - \"What ever we do people don't seem to be satisfied\"   The food was OK."}
{"text":"Nice place..good Indian food! Idli like was really soft. ginger chicken was excellent ..."}
{"text":"Average food at not so average prices I came here on the weekend and they were closed on Sunday. The food the first time I came was decent at best"}
{"text":"This place is way too expensive.  They do not have a price list and they added gratuity for a big group even though it's a buffet and they didn't do anything!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I have low tolerance for spicy food but I LOVE indian food, and they were able to somehow make my food not spicy, which is the first time any indian place was able to do! And the people here are honest about their food and very courteous. I'm not from here, but if I was, this would be my go-to place for Indian food"}
{"text":"Pros: + Good flavor all around. The Butter chicken...  Cons: - Not spicy enough for full legit-ness  Would I come back: Yes  Had lunch with coworkers here. They have solid curry offerings and a variety of chicken, plus good deserts. All pretty good. Only thing is that they don't offer any truly spicy dishes at the level of what indian people would actually eat normally. Not surprising given the location I suppose, but I was hoping to have that option. Still, a good place."}
{"text":"8am Thursday morning went out the night before so didn't pack a lunch and was thinking to myself who can I get to go out to lunch with me, so I emailed my friend and said I'll buy if you fly, and she was down for that. Then we were like oh where are we going, since the office moved not too long ago we are still looking around and trying new places, we both have wanted to try Kabab Palace for a while now, so noon came and off we went!  When I 1st walked in, my nose was intrigued by the smells, smelt so good, couldn't wait until I tried the food. We went for the lunch buffet, though the buffet table looked smaller than others I have been to, the items they have to offer were so much more, many different things to try, North & South Indian dishes, I have say so far this is my favorite lunch buffet spot.  Some of the highlights for me, the butter chicken, omg that was soo good, and the coconut rice, amazing!! The naan bread was perfect too!  Happy to have given Kabab Palace a try!"}
{"text":"The service was a little slow but the friendly service made up for it. The food was good (I got a kebab combo plate) and the servings generous. I don't remember but I don't think they have beer or wine though."}
{"text":"Very good south Indian food. Service is OK. Have been there for Dinner and food has been consistantly good."}
{"text":"I have not and will not eat here.  Their last inspection (12/08/2016) resulted in five priority violations and two others.  One priority violation was a repeat violation.  They got a \"D\" grade.  Looking at prior inspections (all of which were significantly better) doesn't give me confidence in the cleanliness of this joint.  Maricopa County Environmental services has them on a risk control plan."}
{"text":"Don't be scared off by this weird strip mall set up, employees vacuuming 45 minutes before closing, strange shows playing on the TV. Look beyond all that. The food and service were spectacular, and they let several couples in just before closing and offered them the entire menu.   Would TOTALLY go again."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet here is excellent, I think its the best I have tried in Phoenix.  The curry had great flavor, great briani, butter chicken was good, naan was good and they had a scrumptious breaded cauliflower dish I have never seen called Gobhi Manchurian that was awesome.   The mango custard was definitely the best I have had.  Service was below average but the food was awesome!"}
{"text":"the hubby and I ate here this past weekend and found the food and service to be very nice.  We were greeted and seated right away.  We ordered an appetizer that was recommened by the waitress. I forget the name, but it was a pumpkin dish that had ground meat on top. Sounds odd, but was good. A little bit sweet, but the meat somewhat balanced the sweetness.  I ordered the subzi challow a spinach /lamb dish and my husband ordered a meatball dish. Some of the lamb pieces I found to be a bit fatty. Both meals were pretty decent.  Each table is served bread with three sauces. One sauce is a pesto type of sauce, second a yogurt sauce and third a red, slightly spicy sauce. All very good.  I would have enjoyed getting more bread. My husband and I only received two pieces each while the wait staff offered more bread to the table next to us at least four more times.  At the end of our meal we ordered their homemade vanilla ice cream topped with spices. It was very good and you could tell it was home made and not store bought.  I would pass on getting alcohol from here as even the cheap stuff like a bottle of Bud or Miller is $5 a bottle. I can get a six pack for $5 at the store.  I found my visit to Kabab Palace to be very good and I would go back."}
{"text":"Decent food with not so good ambience.......chicken biryani was good...shrimp curry also......custard mango is my fav at all Indian cuisines.....u can try it once.....i believe in trying food at all places once and then pick my fav places....."}
{"text":"tasty lunch buffet.  the Goat curry sounds scary but, its great."}
{"text":"i had just had indian food the night before, that made me slightly ill, but deicded to eat here and was so glad i did! the food was reasonable and the service fairly good. the portions were just right-the chicken tikka masala is a must-have!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Indian food ...but this place is where I meet friends on a regular basis for lunch. The all you can eat buffet is among the best I've ever had. I'd recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Food is good and spicy. The restaurant people are also good but they charge for 3 year old kid as well for buffet. Mindless stupid people they do not know how much 3 year old eats."}
{"text":"Very expensive for limited vegetarian choice.. My meat eating friends liked it though..Really super expensive for the quality of food you get.."}
{"text":"Wife and I had the lunch buffet.  The food was outstanding everything was awesome especially the rice dish.  The food has some similarities to Northern Indian food so it seemed familiar to me but different enough to intrigue me.  The only con was the bread which I guess is traditional but I found very dry.  We will go back for dinner for sure."}
{"text":"Kabab Palace waivers in its quality from making either extremely spicy or absolutely tasteless food . I understand that spice levels are a matter of individual preference , however the fluctuations I have seen at Kabab Palace place you at the mercy of the mood of the chef."}
{"text":"Arrived at 8:30 for Sat dinner and were given some great suggestions.  There was a large family and like 2 other couples at the same time, and all were Indian so we thought it might be good after all.  We started with Chili Pakoras, which are fried jalapenos, but spicy ones!  The hostess even came out and wanted to make sure we understood what we ordered.    Hubby had Lamb Curry, which was in a red spicy sauce-not intense, not bad considering I'm not a lamb eater.  I had the Spinach Chicken which was very tasty and the spinach was just cooked right.  We made one of our meals into a Thali, which is a big tray with several little samplings and we also had some bread that accompanies the main dish.   We had a great time trying out this new food and thinking about recommending and going back.  Total was about $30+, not bad for dinner for two on date night.  Next time I'd like to try the mango dessert and a drink."}
{"text":"Goat biryani is good... Very close to where I live and I gave it a try. You will not be disappointed. Yet to try out some of their tempting appetizers .. Very quite place and neat decor ..Will be back soon with my amru friends for sure."}
{"text":"This place is definitely good for lunch buffet but not for other menu.. I went to take chicken biryani, first it's way over priced and second it tasted like one week old with no flavor in it..   If you are a biryani person, please don't go there.."}
{"text":"Nice food..in the lunch buffet.  surprisingly the aloo bonda and puris werent oily at all... so felt good yo eat... nice variety of menu ..different curries than other restaurants in the valley"}
{"text":"Whenever I have a craving for Mediterranean food, I come here.  Due to food allergies, I am not able to enjoy hummus anymore so going to other places that offer hummus can be bittersweet; However, all is forgotten when I enter Kabab Palace.  The lunch buffet offers so many flavorful dishes, such as banjan, veggie kourma challow, and sabzi.  My faves are the excellent kaddo and qabelee!  My only caveat is the lunch buffet price- $11 before drinks and tax!  However, the spread is varied and delicious, and the temptation to throw caution to the wind and partake in hummus (allergy) is non-existent.  It's easy to overeat- consider yourself warned!"}
{"text":"Kebab Palace has some of the best Indian food I've had in a long time.  The butter chicken was perfectly seasoned with complex flavors.  The aloo gobi was perfectly cooked and just the right amount of spice.  Our order was to go, and they included 2 cartons of rice and 4 large pieces of naan with our order.  Our total for the 2 dishes was ~$25, a little higher than I thought it would be, but well worth it.  I'll have to come back for lunch to try the buffet!"}
{"text":"Best Indian buffet in town! Holds its own against any other better known location. In fact, I shouldn't be writing such a good review because I dislike large crowds. Just hope it can stay in business longer than all of the other ones we loved! Ask for extra Naan!"}
{"text":"Lunch buffet is gud and biryani is ok. I sometimes go thr as its the only decent place to have proper hyderabad biryani in Tempe. I won't say it's great but it's ok."}
{"text":"I'm on a quest, Chicken Vindaloo in every Indian in Tempe. Randomly picked this place tonight.   Chx V for me and Tandoori Grill for the wife. She thinks the grill is fair enough, no issues with it. I think the Vindaloo is Meh, a 2.5 out of 5 dish.  Came with Nan, just bin it, I reckon it's 3D printed.   Price $30 before tip for a take out. Middle of the road price, middle of the road food.   Tip 15% although I read here that the servers don't get them, and I have absolutely no proof of that, I hope it's a lie.  I see there is another Indian kitty corner to this place, I'll try them next."}
{"text":"I love kebab Palace! I have only been for their lunch buffet with folks from work and the service is good and the food is delicious. The prices are  good"}
{"text":"Have been here twice now. I feel it's quite an underrated place. It's better than most Indian places around. We went there both for lunch buffet and dinner and were not disappointed. We've enjoyed many of their dishes like chicken pakoras, tandoori chicken, lamb curry and fruit custard. Our server was friendly  and hospitable. The ambiance was nice. Overall a good experience. We'll be back"}
{"text":"I didn't even get the opportunity to try the food. I went in with a guest from overseas to have the buffet. But the vegetarian dishes seemed old and untouched so we thought we would order a la carte. We asked for the menu and the manager was so rude to us and stood over our shoulder as we were looking at the menu. When we were deciding, she even said, \"make up your minds\". So we left."}
{"text":"I gave this place the last money they will ever get from me. The quality of their food started out as meh and has become abysmal over the few times we ordered from them. They progressively have made mistakes on orders and tonight was the final straw. We never remotely considered this good authentic Indian as they clearly cut corners.  Ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Korma. Asked for Marsala to be mild and Korma to be medium. Also ordered x2 naan...  They used the same sauce for both dishes but added a hint of butter and more yogurt to the korma. We seriously couldn't tell them apart at first. Both were definitely hotter than medium instead of what we requested.   The naan was stale and hard as a rock. Seriously it was like a cracker it was that dry and hard.  We called to explain our disapproval and asked how they would like to fix this for us. Their response...verbatim...  \"I asked him and he said he did not put anything more in the sauce.\"  \"All naan is going to dry out after 20 minutes of waiting\".  No offer of restitution. No apologies. By the way...we ordered by phone and I was literally out front waiting 5 min after the order as I was in the neighborhood. I also live 5 min away. Nothing was waiting for 20 min. Naan doesn't turn to a saltine in that amount of time. This garbage they sold us was sitting around for hours if I had to guess.  The food sucks. The service sucks more. I suggest yo try Passage to India down the street if you are craving and need a quick fix for such cuisine and save yourself the grief."}
{"text":"The food is still great, but it looks like they have too much success and have stopped trying. The last time we were there, back on March 1st (my birthday, by the way), the buffet was all but empty, the service had gone downhill, and it was stuffy inside. We kept waiting for new additions to the buffet, but none came. Of course, we were still charged full price. They had better step it up--I just reviewed two new competitors that will give them trouble otherwise."}
{"text":"You know it's good when you see a ton of Indian people eating at an Indian Restaurant.   This is one of the better Indian places I've tried in the Valley.   What I tried:  Spinach Pakoras  Chicken Tikka Masala Butter Chicken Chicken Vindaloo Chai Tea  I came here for a lunch buffet with two friends and waited 25 minutes during the week. Was it worth it? YES. Was it worth the 20 minute drive to get here? YES.  I'm a fan and will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I have only ever been here for the lunch buffet but they do a very good job of it.  Lots of items good service and delious Mango Lassi's.  There are lots of Indian buffets around but this is a standout.  Try it."}
{"text":"Love this buffet. About $14/person for lunch but lunch is served late. Wonderful selection. Butter chicken and potato masala are my favorites. Always very friendly servers and quick to refill waters. Been to this location many times and will continue to come back. No complaints. Always leave extremely full. Naan included :)"}
{"text":"It pains me to say this because this has been a favorite restaurant of mine for years but....   It's Infested with roaches!!!  I took my mother here for her first Indian Food experience and could not have felt worse about it. Saw 4 live roaches and 2 dead ones. Sorry but that's NOT acceptable.  2 of them were on the ceiling above the buffet by the Tandoori and the other 2 were right on the wall as you walk past the buffet to the bathrooms  The dead ones are right under the chairs when you walk in.  Disgusting!!!   Brought it to the attention of the owner as we were leaving and she still charged us and said she knows about it but the pest company is supposed to handle it.  For every roach you see alive there are 100 more in the walls.   No thanks!"}
{"text":"Good food. But this is an Indian place.. Why does it say Afghan ?? I had the lunch buffet and it was pretty good. Naan, biryani, 3 chicken dishes etc etc .. A decent variety. Will definetly go back again."}
{"text":"This is an absolutely fabulous Indian restaurant, the best I have had in Phoenix. It's definitely the best in the area here in Tempe. I cannot understand some of the poor reviews. I and my family eat here approximately every 1-2 weeks and it's always delicious. I can state for a fact the reviewer that said there are roaches is a flat lie. That is so unfair. I have eaten in this establishment at least 50 times, no roaches. I can only deduce that one of the two other Indian restaurants in the 1 mile radius are trying to tarnish this place. Fortunately, one of those (Aachi) just went out of business. The other, Passage to India, is not as good as this place.   The naan is soft but crispy and hot. Definitely try the chili chicken appetizer, to die for. Can also vouch for the butter chicken, spinach chicken, chicken Marsala, lamb curry and lamb vindaloo. Also be sure to order entrees as Thali, which comes with six house side dishes. Yum!"}
{"text":"Chicken Teka Massala is my favorite along with chicken 65, really nice staff and quick and clean service."}
{"text":"So good! My brothers Indian gf took me there. She approved and so did all of us. Took leftover lamb curry and chicken kabob home and was even good the next day!"}
{"text":"Ah the previous owner sold this joint (to the people from Woodlands?).. how surprising given the poor quality of food they dished out.  Now this is a much better Indian fare. With comparison to NY or any other decent place this falls short. But for chandler with all its Intel and Freescale population it is probably currently one of the better ones in the vicinity. So not surprisingly most of the patrons sport an Intel and Freescale badge... my my I would never have guessed.  On to more serious stuff like FOOD... Well I would say 70%  of the dishes are decent. Unfortunately Its hard to discern which ones. I had to sample each item m in their buffet (lunch) to come to that conclusion.  I'll harp on the bad...The Chettinad chicken was horrible, the dal makhni was \"meh\"... and the  paneer was swimming in oil. Of these I can excuse the dal and paneer... but Chettinad... shame... what a poor representation, given that the owner is... well not from Tamil Nad.. but nearby.  However the desert was different ... yippee  and the eggplant good....lovely....  Will have to go there once again but I'll try the a-la-carte dinner, that should foment my decision"}
{"text":"We really like this place. I usually get the full meal that comes with naan, sides and a dessert and its a lot of food for a good price!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Indian food but not the best I've had.  They did have some really unique choices though.  Today, butter chicken was one of the options, it was pretty awesome.  The tandoori chicken was a little over dry, its a high temp cooked dish, so that is to be expected, but it was still a little over done.  They had another red chicken dish today too, with onions and hot peppers mixed in.  I don't know what it's called, but that one was pretty good.  It's really spicy for those that are sensitive, but I thought it was just right!  Fish curry was enjoyable as well.  Generally, everything I tried as pretty good and I would definitely recommend giving this place a try, its better than Passage to India and the other close by Indian places I've tried."}
{"text":"Note: this is for the Indian restaurant located in the former Afghan restaurant.  Also, to clarify, there is NO alcohol served here now.  I was very sad when the Afghan owners sold their restaurant--the food was fabulous.  That said, I love southern Indian food and was pleased the first few times I ate here under the new ownership, even though they had NO chutneys, lime pickles, etc on or off the menu. Sadly, the quality has been sliding down with each visit.  When I went this week with my family, the meal started badly and continued that way.  The pappads were awful, stale.  When I informed the waitress, she went in the back, then returned saying, \"Oh, we tried to keep them crispy but the kitchen must be too humid.\"  She didn't take ours back or offer us an appetizer.  Instead, they sat there on the table, untouched, until we requested that she take them back to the kitchen.  For the rest of the night, I listened to her warn guests that the pappads were a bit \"off.\"  Good grief.  Still, we didn't come for the pappads, so onward.   As usual, we ordered a LOT of food: chicken and paneer pakoras, poori chana, butter chicken, lamb vindaloo, and more.  Alas,  everything seemed like reheated leftovers.  Not horrible but certainly not what I expect when I pay someone else to cook for me. It's not every Indian restaurant that serves dishes like dosa, utappam and idlis, so I'm sad to see what could be a good restaurant going down the road to mediocrity.  Next time, I'll drive the extra ten minutes and go to Dhaba."}
{"text":"I have a good understanding of Indian dishes, taste and flow of cuisine... this is not the place. Not as flavorful as fellow yelpers have appreciated.. Sorry!"}
{"text":"This restaurant serves the best chicken biryani in whole of Arizona. Ambience is not worth mentioning, but the service was really good."}
{"text":"Went there a couple of weeks ago. First off, we were sat at a dirty table. The staff were very rushed and a tad rude.  The food was ok but not the best I've ever had. The buffet looked pretty decent. However, I found that several of the options were undercooked, especially the dishes with lentils or beans. This wasn't the best indian food I've had but it wasn't the worst either. Just so so. It also seemed a little over priced for what we had.   Maybe we just went there on an off day given the other reviews here. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre. Tandoori chicken was the only dish I really enjoyed. Service was really nice, but doesn't make up for the quality of the food at those prices."}
