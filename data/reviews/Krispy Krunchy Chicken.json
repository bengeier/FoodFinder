{"text":"Great chicken and customer service. Two thumbs up . I would recommend this place highly you would not think that something so great would come from a gas station awesome job"}
{"text":"I'm sitting here waiting for 4 pizzas and I'm the only person that has an order on the grill.  I walked in to a Bollywood film that was on full blast, decor is out dated, and bug shedding on the window seal.   I really believe in supporting smaller businesses but I fear this one has a short shelf life. The woman here is screaming on the phone in an india tongue and being very inconsiderate. The Indian gentleman that took my order ,and is also the cook, is very nice and I can see he works hard.  I'll follow up on this post after I eat the food... It may just be a diamond in the rough. Initial impressions deserve one star.  OK... Got home and found that the pizza was dry and they seriously held back on the toppings. There was little to no sauce, ditto on the cheese. Don't order the pizza from here. Hopefully their management will read this and realize that there is a good chance to turn it around and have tasty food. P.s. I tried the garlic knots and they were drenched with butter and spilled all over the place during transport.. And they weren't fully cooked ( doughy).   One star at best."}
{"text":"Awsome. Love the chicken here. The biscuits are to die for. Carry out only. Reasonable prices. Good service. Clean."}
{"text":"Took over an hour and 40 minutes to deliver, the estimated time of arrival was an hour... Half of the order was completely wrong and the other half was over cooked and gross. Don't order from here!!"}
{"text":"Krispy Krunchy Chicken is one of the better fried chicken places in Champaign. The chicken and sides are all delicious. The staff is friendly, and the store is always clean and tidy. It's much better than KFC and Popeyes with prices that are as good as, or even better, than those stores."}
{"text":"Wow some of the best Chicken tenders or strips I have ever had. Well seasoned, tender, moist and delicious. Lady who worked there told me they closed at 2 pm or when they ran out of chicken. So lunch only but it also means it is fresh. Take out only. I understand they have breakfast options too but have not tried.  Worth a stop!"}
{"text":"The fried chicken is the BEST!  It's well-seasoned without being overly salty and fried to perfection without being greasy.  It would be 5 stars if only they were more than a lunchtime window.  They're available Monday through Friday, but I wouldn't count on them as a dinnertime option."}
{"text":"This place blows. Horribly slow service and awful food. Go anywhere else and you would be making a wise choice."}
{"text":"Don't trip that its a gas station. Its west coast cornerstore style.  The stuff was hot and fresh, and the people were nice. I liked the chicken a lot. Wedges were kinda thick and biscuit wasn't my favorite style.   Online ordering was easy.   I might skip the sides, but I'd pick up chicken again for sure."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the other reviewers: No one will believe that this chicken and catfish come from a convenience store. The chicken is never frozen and breaded on site. The Cajun seasoning is just right and the chicken itself is very juicy. It tastes like chicken in the best way possible and not like fried breading  as you get in other fast food joints. People stand in line for this food so I'm afraid this won't be a secret gem for long. The Superpumper Shell station is also very nice and the whole staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Scottsdale, AZ to South Beach, FL this place is always a solid choice for BOMB fried chicken"}
{"text":"I have to agree with the other reviewers. While the atmosphere is unexpected, the chicken is fantastic. You can't go wrong with anything you order. They turn over food quickly and seem to be vigilant about quality and freshness. I have never gotten a piece of \"old\" chicken here. Definitely give it a try. Be warned that every tradesman in the area stops in a lunchtime so plan ahead"}
{"text":"The Chicken and biscuits are delicious.  It's worth a try. It reminds me of Church's chicken, found in bigger cities."}
{"text":"Ok, went here last night for dinner.  I think that this place is owned by the gentleman who run the liquor store on the end of the strip mall.  The chicken was fried fresh, but It's no better than the chicken that I fry at home myself. it was just OK.  I do find it odd that they opened this JUST before the popeyes is due to open soon.  No competition what so ever."}
{"text":"I read about this chain on Eater and wanted to try it out. This is the closest location to me, stopped by at 6:30pm on a Saturday. There was one piece of chicken in the display. The woman behind the counter said it would take 20 minutes to cook an order for me, and was none too pleasant about it, so I left.   I should also note that the parking lot for this place is hands down the sketchiest place I have been to in years. I'm no stranger to rough parts of various cities. But I felt downright unsafe in this parking lot. I won't be back, not even in daylight."}
{"text":"I am so glad I drove by this gas station/fried chicken spot. After a long drive from Orange County, I was nursing a serious hankering for some fried chicken - my car was nearly empty as I drove through this area of spring valley & I found this gem.   I was a little hesitant about \"gas station\" fried chicken at first but once I saw nothing but 5-star reviews (albeit only a handful), I had to try it.   The chicken is hot and crispy - extremely flavorful, especially when compared to the industrial, greasy chicken that is sold at the chain fast food chicken joints.   If you're in Vegas and have a fried chicken habit, this is an absolute must visit."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say this place is bad because the food is edible. As a Asian, i prefer richer flavor. It says that it is open on 6:00AM, that is honestly not true, I drove there just to eat some chicken thinking I got there on time and don't have to wait anymore; I had to wait like 20-30min more and the time I got there was over 6 already. So just for future preference, if anyone is going there, take your time... The customer service was horrible, 1-10 I would give it a 2; maybe I'm thinking that way because it's my first time there or whatever but I didn't really enjoy the service."}
{"text":"THIS RESTAURANT HAS RE-OPENED.  Again, the Krispy Krunchy Chicken restaurant at 900 W. Bradley Ave is again open as of 7/14/15.  This restaurant needs to become a cook to order restaurant.  This chicken is only good if it's fresh right out of the grease."}
{"text":"This place is getting better, especially the Krispy Chicken Sandwich & the Cajun Fish, which they fry up fresh upon ordering.  The biscuits are wonderful and melt in your mouth.  The staff is extremely friendly.  Please give this place a try."}
{"text":"I was unaware this place is literally inside a gas station. The high reviews on yelp had me still walking inside, where I was assaulted with the smells of a public bathroom. I think I'll pass on gas station fried chicken that reeks of the sewers."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. I am very upset as to what has become of this place. Ever since new management has taken this place - EVERYTHING changed, for the worse. From their food quality, dipping sauces, and most importantly their pricing. Be VERY careful - I was overcharged $1. I ordered a $5.49 meal with an .85c soda, and was charged $7.80. I asked could you explain to me how it's $7.80, and he started hesitating and said it was sales tax, and a $1 custom tax, and .70c for the dipping sauces (which he did not mention until I asked to explain the charges). I let it go the first time. This was the second time happening to me, and I said enough is enough, and give me my money back. Very misleading, be careful."}
{"text":"This place was a very unexpected surprise.  The price is great very affordable that's for sure.  The customer service is wonderful all of them were very nice and friendly.  The guy behind the counter seemed to know everyone and by name.  It gave you a great little neighborhood vibe.  The chicken was nice and crispy and cooked all the way through had great flavor not dry at all.  The only thing is that your can taste and smell the oil needed to be changed.  Other then that I would recommend trying this place and I will be back also."}
{"text":"They have the best fried chicken and biscuits in town! I have literally driven across town in the middle of a work day for a friggin biscuit! So after a few visits for the chicken and biscuits, another customer tells me to try their Philly Cheese Steak....whyyyy?! It is everything I miss from my hometown! SO delicious! My diet has been compromised...and I don't mind!   Now parking? Not so great..but who cares when you're in and out?!"}
{"text":"So far I've ordered chicken, fish, burgers and Italian beef. Everything has been delicious. It's definitely a go to spot."}
{"text":"Crazy good cajun fried chicken, and in a gas station no less!  Saw this place was nearby where we lived, and we were in a KFC-type mood but didn't really want to go there.  KKC turned out to be a way better decision!  The fried chicken is excellent and extra crispy as expected (my favorite) with a little bit of spiciness in the aftertaste.    The potato wedges were great too and my wife loved the jambalaya side.  I have to try the mac and cheese sometime too!  Plus the honey biscuits are really tasty afterwards.  Don't be thrown off that this is in a gas station.  Seriously, check it out, it's an excellent alternative if you aren't feeling KFC/Popeye's."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, I'm impressed with this yard bird. I'm from Dallas texas which is only about 3 hours from Louisiana so being a southern man born and bred, I came in this world with a crunchy thigh in hand. ha. I've been to 2 separate locations and I am absolutely blown away by the chicken actually being pretty damn good! popeyes has em beat and canes is another good choice but the colonel in KFC doesn't compare at all. gas station chicken shows there's some good finds 8n the last places one would look. I like off the beaten path with runway lights directing you into the front door of the same McPlaces. gas station chicken, on the hood, while pumping gas. that was the best first date ever! cheers, enjoy"}
{"text":"If you like anything from Popeyes, give this place a try. You won't end up going anywhere else--ever---and you won't need to. THE BISCUITS....I could live off of these....the honey/butter that is soaked into them, it's amazing. Get extra!! I've never had red beans and rice before but was told it was good - no joke, they are great. It's not dry like I assumed it would be but almost has a gravy. Tons of flavor. Chicken tenders were good but I will be back for the biscuits and red beans and rice! My husband tried the fried chicken - loved it and he doesn't impress easily."}
{"text":"It's 4:50pm. Came here for first time after hearing how good this place was. There was no staff. Gas station attendant says hours are 6am-3pm. Who eats chicken and mashed potatoes at 6am? I'm surprised this place is in business with horrible hours. Pathetic."}
{"text":"Best place. Their biscuits are fire. One of the chickens was infused with hot sauce. SO GOOOOD. I should have ordered a ton of those biscuits."}
{"text":"I was shocked  that fried chicken from a gas station could be this good & the honey biscuits were great."}
{"text":"They are located in the shell has station. I found them by going in to grab a snack for work while putting gas. The chicken tenders are delicious.. way better then KFC. I love the biscuit that comes with a meal. I tried the mashed potatoes and gravy however it was very bland. I guess if its eaten with the chicken it's okay but I probably won't order that anymore. Love that its near my work and the cost is pretty good since i only get a three piece chicken tender strips and a biscuit."}
{"text":"If there was a negative star rating this place would get it definitely - we ordered one large pizza and 8 pieces of chicken to a nearby hotel.   Firstly I promote Halal restaurants where ever I go but....I can't when crap is crap you have to bring it to people's att still   After 2 calls of the original order it still took a total of 1 hour and 40 mins, I am just shaking my head how this establishment can operate selling such horrible pizza and fried chicken. After eating the pizza I need to visit my dentist my jaw hurts it unbelievable. Crispy fried chicken should not be so hard that your teeth feel like they are going to break my teeth. We ordered dark meat and we reviewed white meat which looked like they were on steroids. We should have had Pizza Hut or dominos   Also after such a long wait we were very upset choosing not to tip the driver who then nearly left a smoke show in front of the Hotel. I understand majority of the deliver driver are minimum wage employees but your establishment is represented by your drivers. So no fault to driver but the establishment needs to learn how to run a operation.    I wish I could be positive on my review to support the establishment but unfortunately this place should be operating Message to owners get some better staff."}
{"text":"Worst experience .... rude, nasty hard pizza. Argued with me about returning wings due to them making there own sauce. Order was messed up and took too long. Alot happened that would make this post Extremely long... FYI just don't come here, save your time, money, and patience with another restaurant."}
{"text":"Looks like they tried to make a \"new\" business page to fend off all the horrible customer service reviews and photos of their awful food from their old one.  They're evening stealing images off of the internet to supplement their photos.  Don't bother.  They're still terrible."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here and was pleasantly surprised!  Grubhub delivery...the chicken was juicy and the skin crispy.  I also ordered a Philly cheesesteak - quite impressed and tons of flavor!  To cap it off I had their honey butter biscuits... I could eat these all day long!  Take a chance on it, unlike the other review I had great luck!"}
{"text":"I don't always eat fried chicken/foods, but when I do, I eat Krispy Krunchy Chicken. You would not expect some bomb fried chicken from a gas station but damn this place kills it for sure, I have tried every piece of chicken they sell here and they blow any fast food chicken joint away. It's Cajun style seasoning so if you into some good Cajun batter on your chicken this place is for you.   You can tell a good fried chicken place from how juicy their breast pieces are and I must say this place is consistent on the way it's made because the 4 times we came here the same guy was cheffin' it up. Ohh did I mention how extremely bomb their biscuits are? Ohhhh myyyyy gooooodness this biscuit is so bomb. The honey butter glaze is so good and seems to deep into the biscuit just enough, prior to this I used to like churches biscuits but this place beats it by a whole lot, you wouldn't want to eat any other biscuit again from a fast food joint.   The Filipino aunty who seems like she runs the gas station counter and the chicken joint, reminds me of the aunties back home in Hawaii so it's pretty down home I must say. Just get down here and sample these chicken pieces, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place however, they are just ok. Chicken can be crispier and not so much on the dry side. If you are a halal eater then sure its worth trying else I wouldnt come back"}
{"text":"I love their Cajun tenders and fries.i just wish they would give more sauce.they only gave me 4 sauces for 25pcs tenders."}
{"text":"Inside a sketchy looking market, this place has really good fried chicken. I recommend waiting to get it fried fresh. The skin was crispy and seasoned well.  The fries where crunchy and seasoned. I loved the honey biscuits, right blend of sweet and savory. The customer service was great. I recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"BEWARE ordering from this restaurant on Uber Eats (and I am assuming for dine in as well).  My family ordered the 3 piece combo meal and the chicken wings from Uber Eats last night.  After a long day at the Clinic we were up for some good fried chicken as some comfort food.  Initially was unhappy that they missed an entire order of the 3 piece, but we lived with it as we had ordered a good amount of food.  Initial thoughts were that the batter was very good, flavor/seasoning was on point, and chicken moist...however, they quickly changed within the next 5-10 minutes.  Several of us immediately experienced severe food poisoning and were sick to our stomachs.  I am not sure if it was the wings or fried chicken, but we were very sick.  Until this restaurant addresses health and safety concerns of the food preparation here, I would warn those who are thinking about a delivery order or dine in at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery tonight, had two wings, a breast, a biscuit and rice and beans, And i'm now sitting here with a contented smile on my face. Everything was excellent. The  chicken really is crispy and crunchy. It really does beat Popeyes in my book. The breading is just spicy enough, sort of  in between the two breadings at the forementioned place. The chicken was fried just right. The rice and beans were the real deal, and although I'm not a biscuit person, this one was heavenly. Crunchy on the top and bottom and a delicate middle. Savory and sweet. Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"I know what you're thinking, \"A chicken shop in a gas station...that's good?\"  This place is such a strange little gem that I had to create a yelp page for this location.  For starters, they have a small kitchen set up in the gas station itself, which would usually be a concern, but they fry the food fresh in the store (when I last came in I talked to a nice lady named Elaine who was breading tenders).  I'm not sure of the hours they are actually in the kitchen, but when they leave they put several packed meals in a heatlamp box that is still a lot better than the food you get at QT across the street.  The chicken is good quality from what I can tell and actually tastes like home cooked fried chicken versus frozen strips.  So far I have had the biscuits, chicken tenders, and jambalaya.  The biscuits are the crumbly honey butter kind, which pairs nicely with the cajun seasoning on the chicken.  The jambalaya was seasoned well and has entered the rotation for my lunch options in this area.  I only eat fried food about once a month, but this chicken shop has just got bumped to the top of the list."}
{"text":"Decent restaurant, food is good. I got there when it opened so food was fresh. Try the fried corn!"}
{"text":"When they are fresh they are the best I've ever had anywhere, if you could get made to order they would have a line out the door   4 tenders and a biscuit"}
{"text":"Believe it or not the chicken and catfish here are amazing. Every Time I tell someone about the chicken here they think I am nuts till they trey it.  Make sure you get the original  dipping sauce."}
{"text":"When I called the number ton place an order it was a convenient store and told they were out of business.  Beware of buying the deal, call first"}
{"text":"Who would think that the best chicken tenders in the world are located inside a gas station. If you haven't already tried these things they are my family's favorite give them a shot"}
{"text":"I was introduced to Krispy Krunchy Chicken many years ago when I was living in Phoenix. It is best known for being crispy and crunchy, as the name implies. It is made from fresh and not frozen chicken. Better tasting than KFC, Popeyes, and Churches. When I moved to LV almost 6 months, I was disappointed there wasn't one here... Until now.  The honey butter biscuits are to die for. They are flakey, buttery, and sweet. The chicken is well seasoned and juicy."}
