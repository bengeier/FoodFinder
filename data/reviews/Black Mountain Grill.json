{"text":"Menu items returned - loving it!

Great service at BMG.  We are ecstatic many of the items from the original menu have returned.  Back to being a local favorite!"}
{"text":"The food is really good! I do have an issue with the service when sitting at the bar. Its almost like the bartenders would rather do side work than bother with actual customers. I do like the food and ambiance its just hard to keep trying them out and experiencing such below par service from bartenders. The rest of the staff is very helpful."}
{"text":"I'm perplexed by the tepid reviews. I'm a very picky restaurant customer and I absolutely loved our dinner last night. The service was perfect, the setting was lovely (we sat on the back patio, next to the fountain and had it all to ourselves), and the food, well, YUM! And very reasonably priced, surprisingly so. We started off with a 1/2 bottle of La Crema Chardonnay off of the extensive \"California\" wine list (a steal at $16), enjoyed the warm, slightly garlicky, fresh bread and butter, started with a side salad that had the most delectable balsamic vinaigrette I've had in a long time ($3.95 with entree), and I had the crab/shrimp/brie-stuffed halibut with sauteed vegetables julienne and mashed potatoes while my boyfriend had the salmon in bourbon sauce (both under $20). The halibut was fresh catch, cooked to perfection and everything on my plate was mouth wateringly impressive. The salmon tasted more average to me but the sauce was delicious. We were both very pleased with our meals. We finished it off with their new s'mores dessert ($5.95) complete with housemade graham crackers and a very alcoholic rum-chocolate sauce. Amazingly enough, after polishing all of this off, I did not have that \"I wish I could un-eat half of this because I am so stuffed\" feeling at all, which further indicates to me that they use fresh ingredients and don't sneak in a ton of unnecessary oil. I could have done without the taxidermy inside but otherwise the decor was lovely as well. We will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Love the black mtn grill... Awesome breakfast food that is great after a late night out. Very unusual decor for the vegas area which makes it very unique. Love the atmosphere here, very laid back.."}
{"text":"Won't be coming back until they bring back the old late night hours menu. What was once our (myself and all our industry friends) favorite late night spot in Vegas is no longer worth the drive after work. So disappointing."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a bite because it was close to our new house. The food was great but the service was terrible. We were looking for our new regular spot but the bartender was less than attentive. I don't think we will be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Went to the Black Mountain Grill last night using a Groupon.. appetizers-crab cakes very good and french onion soup, my favorite, which was outstanding. For our main meals we shared BBQ chicken pizza and Monterey Chicken Sandwich w/ the best french fries I have ever eaten.. the pizza went home with us.  There was enough food with the appetizers and sandwich.. Loved the decor..we certainly will be back. Our server Daniel was attentive and we had great refills of our ice tea, never having to ask for more."}
{"text":"Sat a the bar on a Saturday night for a special event birthday party for a friend.  Food was good (special prices for us), mixed drinks were a bit weak, and the bartener was terrible.  I'm so tired of the bad bartenders in this town - and here was another one.  And he's probably not even union, so can't use that for an excuse.  We pretty much had to beg for any service.  Such a shame, with so many bartenders looking for work, that they keep someone like this.  Always gets a bad mark in my book."}
{"text":"AMAZING food! The large pretzel is perfect with a beer at anytime of the day. Service is attentive, fast and very friendly; especially Brent!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! The service is excellent and the food is delicious & presented nicely. Recommend for any appetite. Try the bacon wrapped shrimp, or the ice cream sundae in the Huge cup!! Try anything really, it's all good!"}
{"text":"I agree with Kim A and others that commented on the service. For some reason, men aren't as welcoming and accommodating as hosts & servers. The food was actually better than I expected but the service ruined it for me. I wanted to give them an extra star but the service! What ever happened to great customer service at restaurants these days? Did that get lost in the recession also?

Moving on to the eats - spinach & mushroom dip was good and the soft bread made it even better. Use the leftover dip with your meal, gives it a great flavor. Now my dish, I ordered the shrimp stuffed halibut. While the dish was good, I only have to gripes about it - 1) where was the shrimp? 2) without the lemon butter sauce, the halibut would have been flavorless 3) lemon butter sauce was a little thickier and became too rich for me after a few bites.

While our dining experience was a pleasurable, the service wasn't which again is pretty disappointing. And it wasn't that busy guys, come on!"}
{"text":"Our favorite local watering hole.  We end up there almost every Friday night.  Summer and Paul don't  even have to ask for our drink orders and they always have another one ordered and on the table before the end of happy hour. ( sadly, only goes till.6:00) The happy hour food menu is varied and VERY tasty and filling.  The kettle chips are the best in town.   They have.a fabulous chef...we have probably had most everythingon the regular menu over the past 4 years.  Prime Rib on Fridays and Saturdays!  Manager, beautiful Mia, never fails to stop by our table.and check in...sometimes,.when they are real busy,  she cheerfully serves us...cause that's just the way she is. We often run into friends and push some tables together. Black Mountain Grill is Henderson's \"Cheers\".....where they always know our name!"}
{"text":"I think I seriously found my new favorite restaurant! From start to finish service was sooo on point. Food was amazing! I had the hangar steak and I was left wanting to lick my plate:) Server was Jill she was awesome! Very friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would ! I'm a student at euphoria and me and my girls have dined here twice now, disappointed both times. The first- service was slow, food was slow (we waited over an hour, and ended up having to take it to go-which our server said was ok), and it took us well over 20 minutes to pay since our server was no where to be found. (After we had already asked for the check) we had to go to the bar and attempt to pay there which was another fail. The next time we went we only had 30 minutes to dine. We asked the girl who sat us (which was our same server as last time) if we would have time to order happy hour food and be out in 30 minutes. She said yes, say us, and was our server again. 25 minutes later our food was still not out, so we asked her to bring boxes with our food along with our check. She said \"they can't box it for us\" but we can take our food. She then had another server come tell us the happy hour menu was dine in only. I said ok, but we were told something different by our server and I asked to speak with a manager. An old looking, VERY rude and unprofessional female manager came over and Said rules are rules, and the happy hour menu was dine in only which we were not aware of. I told her that our server told us it was ok to take our food this time AND last time and she kept tell us that is their rules. I quickly removed my debit card from the check presenter and told her she could keep the food, and I will keep my money. She then offered to charge us full menu price for our happy hour items but she would take 50% of my bill off. Which means I would still end up paying way more than happy hour prices for their already over priced and mediocre food. I told her no, I would only pay happy hour prices and to bring us boxes. No one came back with boxes until I had to stop one of their bussers who was the only decent person in the restaurant. The managers hospitality was non existent and her attitude towards a paying guest was unacceptable. After she charged my debit card I decided the way she treated me was not worth paying for. I did not sign any receipts and I took all copies, there for she can legally not charge me. I would honestly rather eat my own shit than deal with that washed up, saggy face old bar whore that thinks she can treat people poorly because she managers a low end bar."}
{"text":"We had two drinks that were unusual.  Husband had something with vodka, half and half and chambord which he liked (I didn't) and I had the Beautiful which was brandy and Grand Marnier which was terrific and a generous pour.  Helpful waiter although table setting did not have bread plates and as I looked around the near-empty room, many tables did not have bread plates, but some did alongside the napkin wrapped flatware.  Place was pleasant enough--very new looking with stone wall that I liked but had that new-rustic-old-trying feeling, which I personally cannot stand.  Too suburban.  Anyway, husband had the halibut dish which he liked a lot and it was a generous portion.  I had a crab pasta dish that was about the worst restaurant meal I have been served in years. Yes, they offered to take it back; no I refused because I was starving and didn't want to stuff myself with the bread.  They did not charge me for the dish which was fair since I ate about three forkfuls.  No kitchen should send something like that out.  Somehow when I ordered a crab fettucini, I thought that there would be a taste of crab.  No luck.  Anyway, if you are in the neighborhood and hungry, the halibut was fine and I would guess the steaks would be, too.  I wouldn't return; husband would consider (but he'd be lonely)."}
{"text":"We had visited several weeks in a row in late 2011 until we saw a waiter at the kitchen pick-up area USE HIS FINGERS ON SOMEONE'S FOOD to check the order. Can you imagine this? The cook standing right in front of him said nothing. We sent a written letter to the manager and never heard back. Needless to say, you might want to keep an eagle eye on the kitchen, which you can see directly from one side of the bar and make sure the servers aren't giving you finger food, literally. Too grossed out to ever go back."}
{"text":"Everything was great! Danny at the bar was friendly and efficient. Summer was an excellent waitress. Everyone was very customer focused!!!
The food was delicious!
I'll be back! Thank you."}
{"text":"If you're after mediocre that takes a really long time to get to your table you have chosen the right place. 

Save your money and just go to Wendy's which is right next door and servers a much better burger."}
{"text":"Got three meals here.  2/3 were pretty good. The Chicken Picatta was pretty decent. My entrée was their Chicken Marsala and while it was served well; the cook needs lessons (apparently) on how to cook chicken. It was TOUGH as a piece of leather. I probably should have sent it back but didn't have the time to quibble with them. A little pricey for what was served."}
{"text":"Just tried to go for a burger.  It's 11:15 am... Memorial day.  No cars in the lot. Hmmmmm.  We go in ,  get money from the atm.  No employees in sight.  Check out the machines at the bar...see a woman near the kitchen who does not acknowledge us.  After a couple minutes we decide to go somewhere else.  I guess I know why there were no cars in the lot,  right?"}
{"text":"Ordered the ultimate grilled cheese. Literally no cheese taste at all.  Very greasy. No onion jam, just burned onions. Slow service."}
{"text":"We went there on Christmas day, we called ahead of time to see if we needed reservations, they said no, unless you want a booth. So we reserved a booth and told them we would be there in half an hour. We arrived and no booth available, she says I see your name here, but its first come first serve, so we waited at the bar, when we were seated we ordered appetizers which were really good, but then didnt get our dinner for over an hour later. People were coming and going and we were still waiting, I complained and was told they had a party in the back room, so they were very busy. When my steak arrived it was burnt and dry, I asked for a container, I figured my dogs would like that. Worse service ever and not the friendliest place."}
{"text":"Previously left a 5 star review  for Black Mountain Grill. We have been back several times since a the food has constantly become worse. Last night was the last time we will eat there. The chicken on the chicken salad was rubbery the buffalo wings were undercooked and ghe pizza was extra greasy. Too bad another local place can't keep up a consistant quality of food. The service is better than average. That is me being polite."}
{"text":"My son and I decided to grab a bite on a Thursday night. This place has a separate area with a very bar and gaming, it looks like you're in a ski lodge. I don't know if they allow smoking or not but we could not smell it at the dining section. 
We got here at 6:00 pm, the dining area was completely empty, we were greeted and seated immediately. Water was brought out to us within a few minutes. We just opened up our menu and our waiter came and wanted to take our order. I love fast service but at least give me a few minutes after I come in before you ask me what I wanted to eat. We asked for bread and butter, it came out fairly quick, the  bread was nice and hot. We devoured the three rolls without blinking. 
My son ordered the BBQ Chicken Pizza ($12) and I ordered the Pasta Pomodora with Grilled Salmon ($18). Both of our dishes were average, nothing to write home about. The pizza crust was nice and crunchy. The pasta had no flavor, I had to add salt and Parmesan cheese, I normally never add it to my dishes. The salmon was a decent size piece and was grilled perfectly. When I left at 7:00 there was only another table of two people beside us. I have been here a few time and the reason why we come back is because it's close to my kid's school. The people were very nice"}
{"text":"It's 24h place, not too crowded and not a lot of smoking so it works great for me. It's  usually a late night, after work spot. After 11 they have a late night menu with 50% off items and I don't think the 22 oz cowboy steak can be beat for 14$ instead of 22$. The servers and bartenders are the nicest and most attentive I've ever dealt with. Highly recommended especially after 11pm"}
{"text":"We found this restaurant on Groupon and it was worth every penny!  The food selection was great, the staff was amazing, and we were seated next to the open kitchen, where we could watch the chefs prepare meals.  They have a different special every night, and contrary to what the info here says, there is free wifi.  Mia was the manager on and she was very helpful.  Danny was our server, and was very professional and friendly.  I definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal at a good price, that wants to be away from the noise of the strip."}
{"text":"The worst dinner ever!!  I ordered a filet done medium and sent it back twice because they brought it to me rate.  I thought this was a steak restaurant...  Guess not, since they don't even know how to cook a steak.  And, the manager offered us nothing but an apology for the ineptness of her cooking crew.  Stay away!!!"}
{"text":"Dark neighborhood bar/restaurant with a taxidermy/hunting lodge feel. I love the watermelon and seared ahi salad ($16- not a big portion). The prices on just about everything are way too high to make me come here regularly. Food is just as good with lower prices/better happy hour at Cheesecake Factory a mere 5 minutes away thus, you can usually find us there or at any number of the other delicious spots on eastern."}
{"text":"Needed a decent place to eat that wasn't a chain and was resonably priced for a good family meal.  Enter Black Mountain Gril.  It is tucked away just off of Eastern Ave and pretty hard to find actually.  We went over Memorial Day weekend at about 7 and it was completely dead for dinner.  Food was good enough.  I had the NY Strip and French Onion soup and my girlfriend had the Salmon.  Best part was probably the soup which wasn't the best French Onion I've ever had, but was still good.  The bar area here was pretty cool actually and seems like it might be a chill spot to have a night cap if you frequent the Henderson area."}
{"text":"I keep coming to this place with friends and its the same story.  We arrive,there is no one to seat us, we poke around to the bar and ask to be seated, they yell at the kitchen and someone comes out like your bothering them. The food sucks and its kind of expensive. The food is all bland. I have tried so many things on the menu and not one stands out as \"good\" This is below mediocre. dont know how they are open"}
{"text":"The food was very good, although the service was lacking. Considering there were less than a dozen people in the bar, it took a long time to get beverages. Our server seemed like she wanted to be anywhere but at work. The photos lining the walls are a nice touch, but it seems they haven't been cleaned in years. The glass and frames are filthy. As an aside, there are multiple stuffed animal heads on the walls and a whole mountain goat on a pedestal. I just can't get behind that. They have a Saturday BOGO, which I normally would jump on, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food. Fatty happy hour not worth it.   Drinks awesome but don't gamble here ouch compared to others nothing seems to be \"comped\" when you play.  Ouch lost 150 nothing but 6 dollar drink back free.  Oh my"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience. The food was good, the service was great and the atmosphere was fun. I got the special, prime rib, and it was very tasty. And my wife got the stuffed halibut, which she thoroughly enjoyed.
Was it world-class cuisine? Probably not. But the experience was worth the price. We will be back again."}
{"text":"After visiting this restaurant three times in the past two months, I need to leave this review. Love the variety of their menu, and loved everything I tried here so far! My favorite right now are the beef satays and the pizzas. I love that the salad is fresh, and the burger was exactly how I desired it. Great fries too! Overall wonderful! And the employees are very helpful and friendly. Happy Hour is great at this place!"}
{"text":"We ordered the spicy Asian wings, pretzlenator burger and the Thai burger.  The wings were a good size but not spicy at all more on the sweet side. Both of the burgers were great, a lot of flavor and cooked right. The prices are a bit high but the atmosphere is nice. Bartender was excellent be sure to ask for Jimbo, very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"The food is over priced bar food. I ordered the queen cut prime rib ($26) & couldn't finish it because it was so tough. The cheap $12.99 prime rib dinners Downtown are better. We don't come here often but when we do I'm reminded why we don't :("}
{"text":"We have been to Black Mountain Grill and usually go in for the midnight special the Cowboy steak 22 oz steak.  We went last Saturday and was given the late night special menue with the steak special still on the menu.  The waiter came to take order and we were told that the steak was no longer available.  He continued with why that they didn't make any money off this special and did we know how much steak was per pound and they still had to pay the cook.   We were a little suprised by his attitude. He was very condescending.
We will not be going back to the grill.  We have enjoyed it in the past but no longer. 
We ended up ordering breakfast which was medicore at best.
It is too bad !!!"}
{"text":"Very strange place tonight~
   When she finally came around to our table , I asked her if there were any specials not on the menu? She looked puzzled, then said No~ 
   We had a poorly trained server, her assistant (bus boy) was attentive & we saw more of him than her~ My husband ordered and she volunteered they were out of the item. Shouldn't she had mentioned that they were out of this or that?????
   Food took along time , like 25 min.....& there was ONLY 3 other tables seated at this time. I ordered Chicken Piccata, the chic was soooo tuff I could not cut it. REALLY!!! I cut around the edges. I don't know what that was however I have NEVER seen chix so tuff~ & about half a jar of capers.... REALLY QUITE SAD!! 
   Then we had to ask for the check, she brings back our cc, drops off the booklet that has our bill.....only it's someone else bill AND someone else's cc~ she was a disaster! 
   I CANNOT EVER IMAGINE GOING BACK~"}
{"text":"Got to say this is one of my favorite late night spots. Bar tenders are always on top of it and and very fun staff. 

And main reason why I come here is the porterhouse special! Probably best steak special in town. You get this huge 24ounce porterhouse and 2 sides, usually get some potatoes and side of steamed broccoli. They also have a great app with the chicken satay. 

All in all great spot for late night bite to eat and drink, who knows maybe you'll even with some money on the machines."}
{"text":"We got a gift certificate for this place, so one evening of drinking leads to us stopping in here.

We each ordered a burger, since we were intoxicated of course. No more drinks though their drink list was pretty cool. Pretty sure I posted a photo. 

The burgers were cooked how we requested and pretty tasty, at least drunk me thought so. The fries were delicious...nice and crispy. Service was pretty good. Seems like the server may have bitten off a bit more than he could chew at times...but he still stopped by here and there to check in. We had to ask for the bread that (we found out) they were just supposed to offer. Still got the bread... but still... it took way longer than we would have liked and I had already finished the side salad I ordered (basic salad). 

Not sure that we will return without another certificate, honestly. Or we may, who knows. I am pretty curious about their chicken parm dish. The types of food on their menu varied, but that was the only other dish that interested me there."}
{"text":"A very cozy comfortable bar and grill near near my home.  I often go there for late night happy hour menu.  The cowboy steak is delicious and my favorite dish $5  buffalo shrimp with chunky bleu cheese on the side.  The best deal of all is the $6 tenderloin beef satay.   

Every time I go there I have a great meal and the staff Steve the bartender is friendly.  It's relaxing and the music is great!!    Nice people, delicious food and cozy spot!!!"}
{"text":"I've stopped in several times to Black Mountain Grill & this time was absolutely the worst experience ever. Stopped in for happy hour with a friend. Ordered a BBQ Chicken Pizza while my friend ordered chicken fingers. (I had been in a different time when I had seen someone order that pizza & it looked amazing - why I decided to order it.) That's when it all went downhill. Chicken Fingers arrived well ahead of pizza while they should have arrived together. Friend said chicken fingers tasted like they were frozen out of a bag - guess you can't expect much for chicken fingers. My BBQ Chicken Pizza arrived with absolutely no chicken on it. After a couple of bites of the 1st piece I asked the bartender if there were supposed to be chunks of chicken or shredded chicken as there looked like little shreds of something on the pizza - it was burnt as well. Bartender stated it should be chunks of chicken & I told him there was no chicken on the pizza & he agreed & took the pizza back & placed another order for a BBQ Chicken Pizza. Waited another 20-25 minutes to get the pizza & when this one came out it was one big lump of cubed up chicken thrown in the middle of the pizza so you could tell it was put on after the fact & wasn't even cooked w/ the pizza as there was grill marks on the chicken indicating just cutting a chicken breast & throwing it on top of the pizza. Chicken was cold as well. I took one look at it & said \"you've got to be kidding me.\" Can't believe that the bartender would even serve that to a customer because clearly you could tell it was chicken thrown on top after the fact. Told bartender that chicken was cold & wasn't even cooked with the pizza & he took it back & asked if I wanted another one. By this time I was getting irritated on many levels (being hungry was making me irritable as well as the situation) as he tried to give an excuse that they have a new cook - who the hell doesn't understand how to make a pizza? You need to put cheese over the top of a pizza then cook it not throw ingredients on it after it's been cooked. Agreed to try 1 more time allowing another 25-30 minutes go by before I got the 3rd pizza.  3rd pizza finally came out & at least the chicken was now placed under the cheese & cooked. Pizza was mediocre at best. Kind of burnt as well. I guess if you want food @ Black Mountain you better stick to the crappy bar food that can be thrown in a fryer & out to the customer in 5 minutes."}
{"text":"We were on vacation, we ate out every night, this place was by far the best on a Tuesday night, the server was polite and the food was great the price was 5 buck more than most casinos. I will be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots on this side of town. 

The decor is great- feels like you're in a beautiful log cabin in the mountains. It feels like home- a couple times, I've dined on the comfortable leather couch in front of the tv, surrounded by bookshelves- awesome! They also have a bar and separate dining area. 

The staff are awesome- friendly, thoughtful, helpful. 

The food is always great. I've enjoyed everything I've tried! Prices are good. They have an awesome happy hour and late night menu. I love that they're open 24 hours- great for a late night meal or drinks."}
{"text":"We wanted to try another bookmark of mine for lunch ~ so Black Mountain Grill it is.  

I felt like we walked into a cabin or lodge with the animal decor and log cabin look.  Kinda neat! The hostess told us to take any table we would like.  It wasn't very busy at all so we had our pick.  Shortly our waitress was over to get our drink order so we could look over the menu.  

I decided on the Thai Chicken Wrap with sweet potato fries.  The wrap had the great thai peanut sauce which had a nice little spice.  But my highlight was their sweet potato fries.  They were perfectly done with just enough crisp.  I was absolutely delighted! 

Our service was just ok. Sometimes it seems as if she disappeared even though there were only a few tables in the area.  We had to wait for drink refills a few times as I noticed another did as well.   Another strange thing was the temperature of the restaurant.  I was freezing as I was eating.  I usually don't have a chilly nose and hands being inside of a restaurant.  

So I was really torn between 3 and 4 stars...  I am feeling generous today."}
{"text":"My family & I love this restaurant.  There are not many restaurants to choose from in the Anthem area that serve such great quality food with a relaxed atmosphere.  My \"steak\" connoisseur husband swears the filet mignon is the best in Vegas.  Our family has used their banquet room for Anniversary Dinners & have had relaxing meals on the patio that features both a fireplace & a walled water feature.  The staff is friendly & accommodating.  The only complaint is the maintenace & upkeep of the restrooms.  It also has a great bar area.  Looks like a hunting lodge.  It has intimate seating areas that include a fireplace."}
{"text":"I love the Black Mountain Grill. Its a video poke bar with a dining room side with an open gourmet kitchen. It has a lodge feel. I had the oppertunity to meet the owner Donna Rocker on my last visit and what a very nice lady. The staff understands customer service and its nice to see that it isnt lost in Henderson. They have a weekly specials menu and post if via their website, facebook and twitter. If you are looking for a fresh not frozen meal with great service, you wont be dissappointed."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to this place by a friend which ended up being a location we'd frequent when we couldn't decide on where to go, or what to eat.  This would be the place we'd hit up for breakfast and on Sundays they have a special brunch menu which offers different items and a buffet style course. 

The food is pretty good here. The eggs Benedict from what I remember never satisfied me but the waffles were done great every time. If you're picky with the way your eggs are cooked this place needs help. 

Overall, cheap eats, good amount of seating and brunch on sundays."}
{"text":"Used to love this place, but they have started raising prices on everything. I don't eat meat and asked to sub fruit or something else that is cheaper and they charge extra to substitute something. It costs less but they charge extra for it. All of their breakfast items come with meat and I can't eat it so I have to pay extra if I want to get something else instead of the meat. Won't be coming back and don't recommend any one else does until they decide to change their sub policy. 

Also my food showed up and was wrong. So they had to redo it and when they did they had meat on my plate when they brought it out. Meat makes me physically sick and I specifically said no meat so they had to go make it a third time. The rest of the people in my group were done eating by the time my food got done."}
{"text":"We've been going there for a couple of years now. There is a new Chef, his food is very good.  If you sit by the bar to eat....the wait staff tends to forget all about you.

I do miss the BOGO Tuesdays a lot."}
{"text":"I was taken to this place by a vendor from my work, so it was free meal. But a review is a review and I was not very impressed with this restaurant. When we got to our table the waiter was forcing us to order food as quickly as we can, which is a big no in my book, especially when half of the restaurant is empty. They kept interrupting us when I was explaining the vendor on how the chemical plant works, so I had to back track constantly. 

I got french onion soup to start me off, and it was probably the most disgusting french onion soup ever. the cheese took up about 1 inch of the bowl and when I finally broke through that layer all the cheese was literally coating the spoon. There was an inch of cheese coating the spoon, which made it unusable for the task. I felt like I was part of a deep sea drilling operation. After barely having any soup, I awaited for my main entree, the hanger steak. 

One thing that I did want to mention before I move on to my meal. The cowboy steak is more of a place holder item to attract customer. They never have enough and it will always be sold out. We got there for dinner around 6PM, and they were all out of it. I also stopped by next day around 4:30PM to see if they had it in stock, but it was gone. So, if you are going just to get the cowboy steak then be cautious. They do have other alternate steaks and this is why I got hanger steak. 

The hanger steak that I got was done medium rare, just as I had asked. It was very flavorful and the the garlic mashed potatoes was perfect match for this steak. 

But its hard to look over bad service and french onion soup, so over all its 3/5 stars. On a plus size this place is open 24 hours, and they do have good late night specials."}
{"text":"We went for a late lunch and were the only table in the dining room.  We ordered the black mountain burgers and creme brûlée.  Both of our burgers were burnt and completely black, even though we had orders them medium; as well as, the creme brûlée was burnt and had an odd thick taste to it. I do not understand how everything could be burnt!  The single star rating was for the sever, who was nice and attentive.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Food is good; hours are great; service is mediocre.  Printed menu omits some prices; the items were listed on the menu with either no pricing after them or a \"plus\" sign to indicate an additional charge.  When I asked the Server how much these items were (e.g., tap beer and the \"extras\" for a hamburger such as grilled onions or mushrooms), he got snippy and appeared annoyed that I wanted to know in advance how much something was going to cost me.  Instead of finding out the prices, he estimated or ranged them - and it ended up he was wrong.  Not the best dining experience."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!!!! Super friendly so nice great service. Food was good I ordered the shrimp scampi and made a few changes and they had no problem. I'm a little needy when it comes to my food and they took great care of me ( Danny) and the staff as well. Just a bonus they're a bronco bar too. I'll continue to come here to watch football and eat. Thanks for the great experience."}
{"text":"I have seen this place go downhill over the years. 

Service levels have declined rapidly since 2010.

Bar staff is basically unaware & inattentive.

Management presence is non-existent. 

Food quality is marginal / average. The prices are also a bit on the high side for what is delivered.

Some of the best items (i.e. Rosemary Chicken) were taken off the menu years ago which was a disappointment. 

There appears to be high turnover with regards to wait staff. This is a sheer reflection on management.

The one PLUS that I do see is the environment in terms of \"decor\" as it does lead to a cozy and hospitable lodge-style environment. Unfortunately, the environment is not supported by the service levels or the product offerings. 

* Basically, I have lost all motivation to return here on my own. Occasionally, I am invited there by family members for a late breakfast or early lunch, but I can tell that they are not exactly hit by the \"Wow\" factor either. 

Lots of improvements need to be made here.....in a hurry.  What a let-down this place has been. Henderson dining continues to struggle for obvious reasons."}
{"text":"Came here to have drinks after school. This was my 2nd time here. Both times the staff weren't very friendly or welcoming. Not very attentive either."}
{"text":"This was our second time back. I'll get right to the point. The food is ok but for a sports type Bar the prices on some dishes are high. However, it was the petty charges which really annoyed us. I ordered the wrap and the server said do you want fries or a salad on the side. I said a salad. I then asked for some dressing for my sandwich. I was given some dressing which was the size of a shot glass which was fine. When the bill arrived I was charged for the dressing $.50 and for the little salad on the side $2. I asked that you gave me the choice between salad OR fries and who charges for dressing on the side? I was told to the effect \"to bad\". I said we'll never be back again which didn't phase them."}
{"text":"DELISH!!!  Went here with my husband and the food was fantastic!!  I will definitely come here again. And the crab cakes!!!  Omg."}
{"text":"A not to miss restaurant when we come to Vegas.  Reasonably priced, food always good, especially their bourbon salmon, and nice atmosphere.  Added bonus, if you come on Tuesday nights before 9 pm.  the second entree is half priced.  This particular night by husband and I both got the bourbon salmon at $22 and the 2nd one was only $11.  A pretty good deal,I think!  Their house salad is a favorite as well as their beef satay appitizer.  The latter enough to make a meal of."}
{"text":"Come here every time I'm getting my car washed across the street at 7 Hills Hand Wash. My favorite breakfast is Pancakes & Eggs and I don't like pancakes but these are very good. They have V-8 for bloody beers as well"}
{"text":"Tasty food, super friendly and efficient staff, ice cold beer. Why only 2 stars then? Sewer problem, the bar had a very bad odor that the staff tried to mask it with a candle in the restroom and by opening the doors on a cold night.  Not the first time we've experienced this there. Hope it's fixed soon or we may have to find another watering hole- too bad."}
{"text":"First visit. The service was good and the food was even better. I ordered the steak salad. It comes with potatoes, green beans, tomatoes marinated and goat cheese ober crisp romaine lettuce. Delicious. I plan on coming back"}
{"text":"At first, I was not a huge fan; however, this place has grown on me. Its not too far from where I live, so if I ever end up meeting someone for a drink, this is usually the place. The drinks are good, food is delicious, and the poker usually has a good payout!

After putting in $20.00, I frequently walk out with more then that, sometimes way more! Regardless, its all about fun and good company. There is a nice bar area, or you can sit down away from the bar, or even outside! The negative thing about outside is that it is usually for smoking breaks from the bar area. Regardless, its a nice local hangout spot."}
{"text":"Service is terrible. GM should not be in the hospitality/food service business. Food was mediocre, assuming it's prepared how you requested and you get it before it's cold. 
I will not be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"Our favorite place for steak. Their menu is awesome, reasonably priced and the food is amazing!!  Go on Tuesday, but one get one half off!!"}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVED this place!! Food was amazing and the service was even better. Our server went above and beyond to make our party feel welcomed and extremely well taken care of. We will be coming back here for sure! Thank you for such a fantastic dinner service this weekend!"}
{"text":"This is our neighborhood bar and grill.  It's within walking distance of our house and the food here is just great.  The filet is USDA PRIME!  $28 for a Prime filet dinner.  You  won't find that anywhere else in town.  It's SO good and they cook it perfectly.  On Tuesday nights, you can get TWO Prime filet dinners for $28 with their BOGO deal from 6-9pm.  The halibut is amazing.  The French Onion soup is out of this world.  Actually, I've not had one thing here that wasn't very good to excellent.  The variable is the service.  The bartenders tend to be not super outgoing and the wait staff is from marginal to outstanding.  Just ask for Jill to be your server.  She's far and away the best.  My wife and I always ask for her.  The other servers and the bartenders keep the place from being 5 star.  The food is definitely 5 star.  It's not cheaply priced, but the food is not cheap.  It's VERY good quality!  We'll be here weekly, and have been since we found it.  We just hope to God Jill is working so we get good service.  And no, we're not related to her or even knew her before we started going to Black Mountain Grill.  :)"}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday at noon with a group of 8, and we were seated promptly. It wasn't too crowded, but it was also Memorial Day weekend so a lot of people may have been out of town.

On weekends, they have a deal where you can get Buy 1, Get One Free for lunch. This is great because that means you can effectively get a dish for half price (you just need to pair up with somebody else at the table) for it to apply! 

Everybody at the table ordered the Country Steak or the filet mignon ($28). I got the filet mignon medium rare but it was slightly underdone, so I sent it back, and they cooked it a little bit more for me.

The quality of the meat for the country steak wasn't particularly great the day we came- there were a lot of us and all the steaks seemed to be underdone unfortunately and the meat was a bit tough and less tender than expected.

The filet mignon was a great, tender though it was a lot smaller than the country (8 oz v 22 oz) steak. I also swapped out my baked potato for mashed potatoes - they were great! The green beans were cooked nicely in butter and garlic - nice and flavorful! 

Service was alright but overall, a great deal if you're in the mood for steak! I heard their burgers are also great!!!"}
{"text":"Thank you to trusty Yelpers for your fantastic reviews for Black Mountain Grill; it ended up to be true to your positive words (for the most part).

The rustic yet tasteful decor was pretty inviting and we were seated right away (on a Friday night) so that was fantastic.

 The sausage fest of a staff that appeared \"busy\" all night (despite the lack of business in the restaurant), were pleasant whenever our table was in need of attention.  I would say the service was average and that's about the best it seems to get in most establishments these days so I'm content. 

Let's talk food.. DELICIOUS!!!!  We ordered the mushroom and spinach dip as an appetizer and the bread that accompanied the dip was soft, warm and paired very well with the flavoring of the dip.  I ordered the chicken picatta and it was outstanding! The mashed potatos were tasty, the abundance of capers (which I enjoy) were delicious and there was just the right amount of lemon flavor to enhance the entire dish.  PS- if you have left over spinach and mushroom dip, plop that stuff on the mashed potatoes for an added boost of flavor.

All in all service was decent, food was delicious and I will definitely keep Black Mountain Grill on my list of options on a dining out kind of evening."}
{"text":"My family and I had breakfast here for the first time this past Sunday.  We were pleasantly surprised at the atmosphere as it was actually nice inside and not smokey and the patio seating was also nice, especially with such nice weather this past Sunday.  We were kinda worried at first as the place was pretty dead with maybe 4 people at the bar, 2 of whom were actually eating.

Any how we sat outside in the patio and were immediately greeted by our waiter who was very friendly.  We ordered a short stack for the little one, a big breakfast for me (2 eggs, 4 strips of bacon, and an English muffin), and my hubby had the omellete with toast (ham, peppers, cheese).  The short stack was 3 thin pancakes that were out of this world!  When it arrived, we knew it was going to be good as it had a nice brown color to it.  My food was also good.  Perfect portion size and very generous with the bacon.  The omellete that my hubby had was sent back as it was on the dry side and the ham was extra chewy.  It was definitely not fluffy so I do not recommend this.  On the flip side he ordered 2 orders of the short stack and his meal was comped by the waiter. Such great customer service!  We will definitely be coming back to try the dinner menu!!!"}
{"text":"Very good cowboy steak price is a little on the high side $28 ..but overall i was happy with the meal"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on a Sunday. Service was atrocious. Waitress forgot half of our order and brought my toast without any butter or jelly. When I asked for some, it took forever to come back with just butter. Had to wait an unreasonable amount of time again to get the jelly. There were only two tables in the place so it's not like she was super busy. 

Food was meh. Very average to below average. Granted, I don't think they're  known as a breakfast place, but if your service is going to be terrible, the food better make up for it!  We won't be back."}
{"text":"First time coming here after a bartender told me they had great food, a good  line-up of beers on tap, and decent late-night specials. I was not disappointed! I felt as if I had walked into Dick Cheney's cabin (minus the dude he shot in the face), the walls were lined with cool animal heads. 

The beer was great, the service was top-notch, and the food was damn good! The crab cakes and the burger are highly recommended. I will be back again"}
{"text":"DO NOT HAVE BREAKFAST HERE...ESPECIALLY ON A SUNDAY as they may have the same chef that can't even make pancakes or poach eggs.  The Poor Mans Egg Benedict was disgusting to look at....now we are back home and two of us are SICK....we both had their Banger sausage so guessing that is the culprit.

We have dinner there frequently and like it very much but DO NOT DO BREAKFAST!"}
{"text":"the service here is horrible. last time we went, no one greeted us, talked to us or took our order. we were completely ignored. we sat there for about 10-15 mins and no one came up to our table. we didn't know if the kitchen was closed or not. you wanna know how long we waited? we were able to call another restaurant and place an order for pick up! we left shortly after that and even then no one acknowledge us."}
{"text":"Went on Thursday night with my husband and my Mom. Anthony was our server and he made the night out a lot of fun! We are locals and have been a few times but this visit reinforced that we need to go more often. I ordered the burger and substituted a baked potato due to a shellfish allergy...I stay away from fried foods because of it...the burger was scrumptious. I have had a hankering for a good burger lately and this filled the bill! The potato came with a side of butter, sour cream and chives...I love that so I can decide who, how much, etc.! My husband ordered the Cowboy Steak. It is huge...it comes with 2 onion rings and I believe is set on mashed potatoes. I don't think they had to wash his plate after they tossed the steak bone, he pretty much cleaned it all! It is his goal to walk in, sit down and say \"I'll have the usual!\" and magically the Cowboy Steak will appear! My Mom ordered the chicken parm...she said it was wonderful, left full and with a to go of leftovers for lunch! Nice ambience, love that it is not super bright...love the quiet booths and, again, Anthony was friendly, fun, attentive and really made the night!"}
{"text":"Waited 50 minutes for our meal which consisted of a shrimp cocktail, which took 25 minutes to get, 2 salads, that came out a minute before our meals, soup and a rack of ribs. When I said something to our waiter he said everyone ordered at the same time. There were 4 other tables so it wasn't like they were slammed. There was a woman who was either the hostess, manager or owner who when we left was at the bar drinking wine. How about someone jumps into the kitchen and helps get food out. The waiter didn't communicate that it would take almost an hour to get our food so apparently trying to hide it from the guest is the way to go. Needless to say we won't be going back ever. Epic Fail!"}
{"text":"Bleh! I hate posting negative reviews. Our waiter Matthew was awesome and tried to be as helpful as possible despite being yelled at by a lazy kitchen. It wasn't his fault that the kitchen's ticket times were terrible. It took about 30mins for our apps and over 60 mins for entrees. 

I'd totally understand if the restaurant was packed. But it is wasn't. We were one of Maybe 3 tables in the place on thanksgiving.

The kitchen staff clearly didn't want to be there. So they took their frustration out on their patrons.  

My husband's food was ice cold! We we're both in the restaurant business for a long time, it's HARD to serve cold food!! 

My son's shrimp were BAD. Old, bad, whatever you wanna call it. They tasted fishy & gross. 

Half of my food was cold :-/ 


At the end of our dinner, even with several items comped, it was over $100 for cold food and it ruined thanksgiving. 
Never again. They haven't heard the last of us if we end up sick from this food."}
{"text":"Black mountain grill is a combo bar and restaurant. The kitchen stays open 24 hours and always has something to satisfy. I usually come at some ungodly hour in the morning, but this time we made it in for dinner when the kitchen was in full swing.  We arrived at about 8'oclock and were immediately seated.  The restaurant side of the bar is configured in a square with an open kitchen at the top so you can keep an eye on the chefs and see when your food is ready. I saw 4 servers taking care of about 15 tables.  Being the single most impatient person on the face of the earth I like to order, eat and escape in about the time that it takes me to type this review. My friend however enjoys the art of dining and tells me that the service was good. The bus boys / food runners/ servers were always on top of refills empty plates and silverware replacements. 
I had the beef Wellington and corn soup and friend T. had the Alaskan salmon and rice. Aside from a little snafu with the soup (We were told lobster bisque was on the menu and it turned out to be corn or French onion) everything was great and the server recovered well by comping our corn soup.  My only gripe was that the food was a little slow coming out, but I think that had more to do with my hunger then the actual time it took to cook the dish. The dishes were about average $15 to $37 an entre.  If you are up and out at 2am then have a great grave yard special and the chicken fried steak is the best in town. To top it all off everything on the menu is available for take out."}
{"text":"I've been going to Black Mountain Grill since they opened & have been a fan since. I love their food and the bartenders (the female - Deirdre, I think) is the BEST! My favorite dishes there are the Pesto Pasta, the Beef Wellington, the Thai Beef Pasta, the Steak Salad, their occasional Roasted Red Pepper soup, the occasional Chicken Cordon Bleu, the pizzas... The offer a great wine selection and comfortable atmosphere. I've been so often, the staff knows me by first name now (is that sad?). :) I often steer friends/family there."}
{"text":"Hunting loge decor is out of place but cozy after a fashion. Food is excellent."}
{"text":"There were 3 people in my party and our meal took 45 minutes to arrive. I ordered spaghetti and meatballs and it looked and tasted like spaghetti and watered down tomato juice. Management didn't charge me for it"}
{"text":"My husband and I went last night (Monday). I have to say it was FANTASTIC! We had the beef sate for an appetizer which was wonderfully delicious. I had the BBQ chicken pizza and he had the Ginger Crusted Tuna Salad for main course and we shared the Carrot Cake. I have to say everything was wonderful probably the best dinner out we have had in quite sometime. It was out first visit but DEFINITELY it will NOT be our last! Well Done! Bravo!"}
{"text":"Nice local place! Great late night specials and the bbq ribs are fall off the bone great.  The bartenders are friendly and know how to make a great drink."}
{"text":"Waiting 30 minutes for food, asking for bread 3 times and getting overly salty food is not worth the one star minimum. The waiter didn't offer the specials which would have changed the order. When I complained about my dish they didn't take a discount off the bill, offer a dessert or anything. The rolls reminded me of supermarket dinner rolls. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"I Have eaten here about 3 times for dinner and once for breakfast.  The breakfast was a 4 star experience because of one thing, bangers, Scottish Bangers.  If you don't know what that is, it is a sausage link that is savory and about 6 inches in length.  The rest of the breakfast is well executed as well.  The Big breakfast was better than any chain place that specializes in breakfast I mean you IHOP.  BTW under beverages you can get hot cider too.  If you live in the GVR or Anthem area this is a great little quiet breakfast spot not like the others.   As for dinners, they make a good burger but not quite as good as BJ's brew house down the hill on Eastern.  The pasta dishes are good.  I had the eggplant which using an A-F scale I would give a B-.  But Truly great Italian can be hit or miss in the Valley.  The calamari appetizer was a little greasy, again BJ's are better.  Overall though this place is solid and you can tell by the families that show up.  The owner is usually lurking about and she is dressed like the help.  She is blonde and about 5'3' with a very appealing smile."}
{"text":"Went here ecause we had a Groupon and were very pleased!  The decor is lovely, warm and inviting.  Were seated right away and the waiter came quickly.  Ordered the Halibut stuffed with shrimp, delicious!  Also the Rib Eye was perfect and the jalapeno mashed potatoes tasty, although would've like a little warmer.  Started with a delicious french onion soup, really tasty and rich, and the mountain salad.
Overall was a great experience, place filled up quickly (maybe the Tuesday nite buy one Get one free special?)...will definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"Great food and the bartender was really fun and personable! Love the atmosphere. Will go again."}
{"text":"So I went back to this place last night and enjoyed it much better the first. The fire place setting was an enjoyment along with the popular 22 oz cowboy porterhouse. It was delicious. I was a happy girl at 5 clock this morning."}
{"text":"This is my second time going to this establishment, I sat at the bar and was greeted by Deidra ( bartender ) she was very attentive and had good conversation with my wife. Deidra was very personable and my wife was very pleased with the service here, we will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"How can you beat 2-for-1 entrees from 11:00- 2:00 on Saturday? That being said, everyone seemed to love their burgers, but the French Dip was awful. The meat was grisly and fatty, In spite of that, I'd come back again. I just wouldn't order the French Dip."}
{"text":"Gees reading some of these reviews I can't believe it's the same restaurant I eat at.  Unless they had a change in cooks and staff recently I have never had a bad meal here or bad service. However I did notice some of the reviews are from very late night visits and within the last month.  We have had  breakfast here as well as late lunch which included  hamburgers, chicken piccata  (no capers!), beef satay skewers and salmon and ribs. All very good. Service is always good and drinks constantly refilled. Only 4 stars because the entrees can be quite expensive."}
{"text":"This is a smoke free pub with an almost across the board good menu. Some of the prices are a little much, considering you are eating in a 24 hour bar with video poker machines, but the quality can be surprisingly good. I go here fairly regularly and have tried a lot of menu items. The burgers are really quite good, the soups are too, and the side dishes that come with the other entrees are often delicious. Some of the appetizers are strangely proportioned or a little bland, but overall the food is definitely pretty good and reliable. The staff is really friendly and the atmosphere (aside from the confusing mix of genres....what is the sailboat doing in there?) is pretty cozy. Most of the times I have met up with people here, time has flown by and everyone has had a good time. Seems to be good for people of all drinking ages, and lots of old timers mix it up along side the younger generations."}
{"text":"Good. Not impressed with happy hour prices. 
$14 for steak and eggs. Steak was about the size of quatah. 
Boston accent. 

Stop criticiZing my reviews, cat!"}
{"text":"Came here with a groupon on the last possible day of eligibility. It was fairly busy and our server apologized in advance for the wait times and menu options. The halibut I had been hoping to try was no longer available. Our waitress was overall fairly accomodating through the night but she was certainly right to warn us about the wait time-- we did spend a decent amount of time awaiting our main course. We decided to start the evening off with some spinach dip. I liked it-- it was thick and creamy, as expected, and much more seasoned than the one you might find at a TGIFridays. The bread sticks that came with it were extra crunchy--perhaps by design.

The actual bread basket was decent I suppose. I don't recall much  being in there other than your standard french roll. My girlfriend ended up choosing the pizza, and I went with the filet mignon. The pizza was pretty unremarkable-- it tasted rather generic and we ended up taking most of it home for leftovers. My filet mignon came out mostly to my liking. I ordered it medium rare but I would say it leaned more rare than I would have liked. In their defense, it is a difficult cut of meat to cook just right because it is so delicate, and I suppose its better for a steak to be slightly underdone than overcooked. The steak rub was adequate and I required no dipping sauce. The baked potato that came with the meal tasted like...baked potato. Nothing fancy-- there was some sour cream and butter to make it more palatable. I will say that the asparagus was probably the best I have ever had in any restaurant. They were cooked in some sort of buttery, citrusy finish-- which is my way of saying I don't know what they hell they cooked them in but I had no problem lapping them all up. 

I think this is a decent place to bring your family for dinner. I guess the decor is sorta western and cool if you're into that sorta thing. I'm not sure that this place really excels in any one particular area of cooking, but I'd sure as hell choose them over a Chili's or Applebee's or some other american style chain. And the fact that they are open 24 hours is certainly a novelty worth mentioning. I doubt I'll be back any time soon but don't let that deter you-- for a late night meal especially, they are a way better option than a Norms or Denny's."}
{"text":"Held a birthday party here last month for a friend in their private room. Everyone was so accommodating and the service was outstanding. Everyone had a great time! Thank you to everyone Black Mountain Grill!"}
{"text":"February 2013 

I am kind of a French Onion soup snob... I have to say... I enjoyed their version very much! Pizza was pretty good, too! :-)

Looking for late night fare in Henderson... this is your place!

{"text":"As always, everything was great. It's like coming home. All the familiar faces. It was great seeing and visiting with all our dear acquaintances. And the video poker machines were good too. Good job everyone. And thank you to all"}
{"text":"So I called for food to go and spoke to Paul I ordered cilantro chicken wings 
Beef satay (medium) n Thai chicken wrap w sweet potatoes for $2 more  we called @6:15 n he says it'll b done in 15 minutes the bill was $38.92 I gave him 8 but then I waited 10 minutes more my food wasn't ready when I got there so it's like... Reallllllly???? He offered if I want any alcoholic drinks n I'm like... Ya .. U told me it'll b ready in 15 minutes I got there n it's  another 15 minutes .. Duh"}
{"text":"Don't wait for Groupon;

This place is great! the Bar is open & great for making new friends.
Dining room has good size comfortable booths, with overflow seating up in the loft.
I especially like the sofa area  for drinks & an informal feel with the soft leather chairs & couch ( mtn lodge feel).  
As this weather cools off, chillin on the patio will be a first come rush for the locals.

Food....Upside down apple pie with ice cream is big enough to share but why would you?  The steaks are cooked to perfection & the salads make you feel like your eating healthy.  As for starters, the fish is very fresh & if they have any of the Ahi available when you are there do not hesitate.

It was well worth the drive & we do this without a coupon & it was still a killer value."}
{"text":"Food is good, service was good. Only gave the 3 stars because I think they are a bit pricey. Solid place, close to home. However, I'd probably go to BAR up the street, because they are the same price, but their food isn't just good, it's incredible. They just aren't special enough for the prices they charge."}
{"text":"The food is so so in general. But to me they way overcharge for the rice. $6 for a very tiny portion equal to half of a small bowl. I like to eat rice with some of their dishes, but it always bothers me to pay that ridiculous price. Tonight they gave us a thick iced tea like it was very old or sat overnight or like it was mixed with oil. We had to order soda and they did not even give it to us for free as a nice gesture."}
{"text":"Ordered a cowboy steak with the BBQ sauce on the side. Note that this steak is a porterhouse and is about an inch thick or a pinch thicker. I ordered it well done. The steak arrived medium well. I did not have a problem as it is hard to cook a steak of this size well done all the way through without it getting tough. As always, I started on the strip side of the porterhouse and finished up on the filet side. The steak was tender all the way through and very enjoyable. 
Onto the side dish......jalapeño & cheddar mashed potatoes. I didn't care for the potatoes and didn't finish them as the jalapeños were crunchy. I just have a hard time getting past the crunch factor when I m eating something that should be creamy. Perhaps they should give the jalapeños a quick Sautee to soften them up before they add it to the mashed potatoes.  This is what made this rating a 4 instead of a 5. 
I'm not sure why they cover this steak with BBQ sauce......I mean why would you want to mask the taste of such a good steak with it? If you're a true steak lover you'll agree and ask for the sauce on the side a s well...or even leave it out all together. Great service from our waiter Paul. Worth a trip back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Been Coming here for the last 17 years. Food drinks and service has always been on point."}
{"text":"After 11pm menu is great, prices and food. Machines have high minimum bet and all the staff is good except the Latin guy that comes in around midnight. Because of his obnoxious-ness we leave as soon as he arrives. Ambiance is good."}
{"text":"Great food and great prompt service at moderate price. The ambiance was also very nice. 
I highly recommend..."}
{"text":"This is by no means \"bar food.\" It's a neighborhood bar with exquisite food! Where else can you get buffalo shrimp, petite beef wellington and italian stuffed chicken? Their Spring Salad is to die for and the Salmon is as good as it gets. Well worth the price and the drive (if you don't live around the corner like me)."}
{"text":"I stopped in with a friend for some drinks and we ended up staying for dinner. The bar area was smoke free--a rare find for a poker bar!

Our dinners hit the spot!  I had the chicken sandwich and my friend had the burger. We both enjoyed salads with our meals. Definitely recommend the anchovies on the caesar.

Friendly and fast service (from the bartenders to the wait staff), relaxed and pleasant atmosphere, great food. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar!!!! Excellent waiters / waitresses and Bartenders! It is our go to spot close to home.  Beer is usually ice cold and food is always great! We usually go 1 - 2X a week."}
{"text":"Really nice chill place, servers are good - but could stop by more to check on patrons.The crab cake appetizer are the best.  The only thing missing is mist fans outside for the hot weather."}
{"text":"I had the Blacked Ahi Watermelon Salad it came with sweet soy & wasabi-marinated tuna, almonds, tamarind vinaigrette! I'm not a big fish person but this was really good. Our witness with real nice and the chef came out and checked on us!"}
{"text":"Food was so so, service was bad.  I had heard this place used to be good, but it definitely went downhill.  Don't waste your time or money. Not to mention, the horrible sewer smell, which has apparently gotten much morse.  It's so bad it gives you a headache in a short time."}
{"text":"Place was decent. Good service. I would've given four stars if they executed better. The prime rib was cold and the pepperoni stuffed chicken (I subbed sautéed mushrooms and asparagus for sides) was very salty - and I like salty food. The burger was juicy but also salty. I could be dragged back quite easily."}
{"text":"Salmon was tasty.  Place used to be packed.  Now easy to get a table.  Kids enjoy the food and the place is tasty."}
{"text":"The food was great, the service was ok (not awesome, waiter made us feel rushed or that we were bothering him when there were only two other tables with guests).

The thing that got me was that when I asked if they had a \"kids menu\" I was told \"We have kids macaroni and cheese and kids chicken nuggets\" and what I got was two $7 adult portioned meals.  I would have never ordered two large meals for a 4 and 2 year old, I would have never ordered two $7 \"kids\" meals, I would have given them some food off my plate (especially the 2 year old) before spending $14 on \"kids meals.\"  I suppose I should have asked the price, but given they are not listed on the menu, I would have also expected the price to be disclosed if it was greater than the average kids meal.

I've always loved Black  Mountain Grill.  Used to be a favorite spot for me and my husband back when I lived in Vegas full time... very kind hostess, very clean, great food.  Just annoyed with the kids meal scenario."}
{"text":"Went here two days ago for the second time because once again Groupon was offering a deal for this place 20 for 40 worth of food so I said hell why not. This time I had the french dipper and mixed veggies which was very tasty and my girlfriend had the ahi salad which I tasted and had alot of flavor and was very well prepared. Only reason that I give four stars is because the app was average at best it was the shrimp wrapped in bacon I just felt like the sauce it was covered in was the only seasoning they used shrimp was bland under the salty bacon. Overall for sure would recommend this place to anyone looking for some good food they also have dinner specials each night. I basically had a $70 dinner for 32 after Groupon and remaining charges which also included two drinks and the apple pie desert which was also very taste"}
{"text":"Bought  a groupon and came late in the afternoon to try it out.  Service was average.  Food was about twice the price that it should be.   The place claims that they have great steaks but there weren't any on the lunch menu.  I had the ribs and they were fair although tony romas would have been better at about a third the price.  The beer was cold and the decor was nice.  The prices were way too high to consider coming back for an average meal."}
{"text":"This was my 1st trip to @BlkMtnGrill. It's A lodge-like bar & grill with seperate dining room the kitchen is open in the dining room so you can see your meal being made. Really Cool:)

After taking a minute to clean up and check the place out-which if you are a hunter you will love it. Very cozy with a fireplace front & center big comfy seats and lots of great decor;-)

Since we arrived just before 11- we could order breakfast or lunch and decided to do BOTH.

We started off with the cheese plate(cheese & fruit really)-then ordered a 3 item omelette with ham,bacon & cheddar-potaotes & english muffin-also a burger with grilled mushrooms and french fries.

(NOTE: Drinks-they serve PEPSI)

Service was OUTSTANDING-our drinks were filled quickly and the food was brought out in a timely manner.

When the food arrived we knew immediately we were in way over our heads-it was ALOT of food!!

The burger was good a little-bit over cooked, the fries were great.

The omelette was insane-the was a whole hog in there soooo much ham & bacon:) maybe a little too heavy on the cheese but that was an easy fix:) I like shredded potao hashbrowns myself but the kids loved the country potaotes!!

The cheese plate was fantastic with strawberrys,granny smith apples,grapes and raspberries and several different cheeses-my favorite was the smoky cheddar-yummy:)

Yeah I know I only tried the bar food but it was damn good.

They serve a much more sophisticated menu than the items I ordered so I'm gonna have to go back some Tuesday evening (2 for 1) and try their dinners. Maybe the Stuffed Alaskan Halibut of Petite Beef Wellington;)"}
{"text":"We had so much fun here on our Vegas weeding excursion.  We met friends here for the Bronco/Steeler playoff game and it was awesome to be in a Bronco bar away from Denver.  The place was packed with fans dressed in Bronco gear and the air was filled with a playoff atmosphere.  All the apps were very good,the beer was cold and the wait staff was on their game and made it a perfect place to see the game away from home."}
{"text":"My first time going to Black Mountain Grill was a nightmare. It was the only thing open late at night, so I decided to give this place a shot. Long story short, my bill was $19.The next morning I checked my bank account, and I was charged $40. I called Black Mountain Grill the next morning to speak with a manager. Unfortunately, the manager was not available. The employee took my phone number, and said the manager would call me. HE NEVER DID. Thank goodness for my bank, they took care of the incident unlike the irresponsible manager. Shows how much they care about there business!"}
{"text":"I  have not been here in a very long time and I was very glad to see this place is still here.

It is a NON Smoking establishment but they do have an outdoor patio for people who want to grab a smoke.  The food was WOW and the service from our server Summer was amazing.

They do what they can to cater to allergies or gluten sensitivities even though they do not have a gluten free menu.

We started with the wings, Salt & Pepper which are double fried and made them not only the crunchiest wings we have ever had but they were the most amazing wings we have had in a long time.  They were NOT greasy at all and the taste was amazing.

We also had the fish and the porterhouse steak which was one of the best I have had..  The chef is amazing and cooks your food to order and does very well.  I asked for garlic butter on the side and it went with the steak really well.  

Summer was awesome, she knows her food and is knowledgeable about Organic, GMO's, etc and can have a really educated conversation with you about food and concerns you may have.  We had NONE here, this place was awesome and is a popular locals hangout and one we will be back to often.

This place has a history for us, one we shared with Summer and we will be back.."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today and they have a new menu. So sad about this! This is or I should say was one of my favorite places but the food is not how it used to be. I had the chicken panini sandwich with chips (no more fries either) and it was pretty plain. The bread seemed sweet as well, not satisfactory at all. The bartender was a sweetheart and that's why they get a 2 star rating. 

Update 06/26/16

Back to their old menu and could not be happier! They even added some bonus items and they are delicious. Extremely happy!"}
{"text":"The Stuffed halibut was way overcooked! It was stuffed with shrimp and blue cheese instead of Brie from the menu. It tasted so bad! Topping that off by laying it on a bed of instant mashed potatoes made me wonder why anyone would eat here. ((looking around)) ummmm...the diningroom must be empty for a reason! Only patrons are drinking at the bar! Luckily i ordered a four cheese woodfired pizza for an appetizer. It was the highlight. The chocolate bomb desert was tasty but didn't make up for the meal."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick beer on a Monday evening.  7 people at the bar.....took over 5 mins to get a beer.  Perhaps I am not a regular here but it ain't busy by any means.  With all the bars on Eastern Ave you would thing service would be a plus.  This place kinda sucks......only thing going for them is no smoking.  I won't be back.......oh yeah never got that beer........garbage.......can I give a minus 1 star yelp?"}
{"text":"On Tuesdays entrees are priced on special at 2 for 1.  We each chose the stuffed halibut (brie, shrimp and crab) that was accompanied by a delicious mushroom risotto and grilled vegetables.  The halibut on 2 prior occasions has been very moist, but this evening it was overcooked and bone dry."}
{"text":"The food, service and atmosphere here are all tops by my standards. You can't go wrong with ordering anything off the menu. I haven't tried a lot of the higher-end entrees, but then again I'm pretty simple and usually swing in on a short stop for a snack. Salad, wings, soups, all good. I have never been disappointed here. Best non-smoking bar/lounge where people are friendly and games are fun."}

{"text":"I appreciate Black Mountain Grill and am grateful to live relatively close by so I can go a couple times a month. The restaurant serves delicious food and the servers are friendly. The bar is fun and the bartenders are friendly and efficient and they remember folks' names which is so nice. Thank you BMG!"}
{"text":"We've passed the place several times and finally dined for a nice romantic dinner. The groupon tipped our scales to finally try the place...and I'm so glad we did! Everything about the meal was great. 

We started with the buffalo shrimp appetizer, which has me writing this review because I can't get them off my mind. They were so good and I can not wait to go back and have them again. Very good amount for an appetizer and great blue cheese dipping sauce. 

I had the stuffed halibut which was delicious and the plate had an amazing complementary sauce. My sides were the mashed potatoes and seasonal veggies, sliced thin and I enjoyed both very much. My husband had the crab cake BLT, which he didn't love, but he's not a big BLT lover, so I wouldn't take that for much in this review. They did have more beers on tap than he expected, which is always a plus in our book. 

The only negatives I can think of was that my cocktail was very standard and something I make at home easily (pom martini) and the atmosphere was definitely an older crowd in the 60's and up, but could have been the Tuesday deal and timing that influenced this. 

Definitely can not wait to return and try more buffalo shrimp, the mushroom spinach dip, the fillet, the beef wellington, and other cocktails!"}
{"text":"Local Bar and Restaurant here in Henderson and I really like this place.

1. The interior is like you are at a lodge in the mountains. Very good attention to detail and quality interior decoration.

2. Comfortable chairs, sofas, tall boys, and plenty of places to sit.

3. That bar they have is fantastic.  Tons of wood and character.

4.  The waiter and waitresses are all very nice, accommodating and very professional.  They will take care of you top notch.

5.  Try  that pretzel that they have.  It is a ginormous tasty pretzel that is fun and comes with cheese and mustard to dip. 

Great prices, ambiance, selections, service and atmosphere.  What more can you ask for."}
{"text":"Got to love Groupon.  

We probably would have never tried this place out if not for the 20 for 40 Groupon that we got.  We decided to go there for dinner on a Saturday night to try it out.  The place wasn't exactly empty, there were a few patrons in there.  Definitely not enough people for a Saturday night though.  Our server was nice and friendly - pretty standard.  I'm not sure that the ambience of the place warrants the higher prices that they charge.  It's your standard restaurant - nothing fancy.

I got the filet mignon based on other recommendations on yelp.  I was easily able to swap out the baked potato for mashed potatoes.  It also came with a side of green beans.  The steak was pretty on point!  Cooked to medium perfectly with great flavor.  The sides were actually pretty tasty too!  I just wish there was something on the steak that would separate it from a steak that I could cook at home, you know what I mean?  There was nothing particularly special about it.

He (the husband) got the beef and portabella dip.  I love French dip sandwiches and I'd have to say that this one was just OK.  Nothing special to it... I've had better plenty of times.  I really like the au jus sauce and ended up dipping my steak though. 

My one complaint would be the crème brulee.  I love crème brulee and they really messed it up.  It was cold and more like really thick pudding than warm and custardy like it should be.  Make like the 90's toy and skip it!

I'd have to admit that there are probably better restaurants out there for the price that you pay and the food that you get.  Overall, I'm confident in giving this a solid A-OK.  Go mediocre!"}
{"text":"Bartenders are miserable. Insulting. Food is ok. Owner is a head case.  Sort of \"in crowd only\" mentality. If they don't know you, you're nobody just taking up space at their bar. Boring, not going back.."}
{"text":"This is fast becoming my fave neighborhood place to eat, very comfortable warm welcoming lodge like setting, huge bar, excellent patio, cozy dining room but the star of this show is the food ! Always fresh, the menu has great variety with layers of flavor in each bite. Staff is young but attentive and fairly knowledgeable. Check out the weekly special especially the Tuesday night buy one get one half on entrees and buy one get one free Saturday lunch hour totally worth it."}
{"text":"We bought a $40 Groupon for $20 a week or so ago & decided to give it a try last night. In a nutshell: they are charging waay too much money for the food that they are serving. There is nothing about the food that justifies charging what they are charging. If you want more details, read on....

We were seated promptly & our drink orders were taken. They then brought out a basket of what I could only describe as a loaf of Pillsbury  bread. I like my bread, so this was a big disappointment.

I ordered the Miso Sea Bass ($24.95) which came out still frozen in the middle (could not get my fork all the way through it) & had to be sent back for additional cooking. That came with undercooked (yet oddly enough at the same time, gummy rice & a mix of previously frozen broccoli & shredded carrots that were steamed & sprinkled with black sesame seeds. I guess this was their attempt at trying to make it seem fancier than what is was but they failed miserably. There was also a little bit of what I'm sure was bottled teriyaki sauce on the plate. I do have to say that when I got my fish back after almost 10 minutes of me worrying that it was now overcooked, it was perfect. Moist & delicious. Just wish that it had been cooked properly the first time it came out. 

Now here's the part that really irks me.. from the time we sat down, the waiter was pushing the evening special which was a Prime Grade 14oz Ribeye for $26.95. He went on & on about how delicious it was & what a good deal it was considering it was prime grade. Hubby went with his recommendation & ordered it. Waiters, listen up.. If you are pushing a menu item & really making it seem like we would be crazy not to order it, it better be the best thing you've ever eaten. If it's just ok, don't rave about it for close to 5 minutes. It was just ok. It was a very thin cut, we're talking less than a 1/2\" thick & had quite a bit of fat. I know Ribeye is a fattier cut, but this was the hard gristly fat, not the kind of fat that is marbled throughout the steak & melts in your mouth. We've had prime grade beef before & I dare say that this was not prime grade. It came with Garlic mashed potatoes that had been over-mashed & about 5 stalks of asparagus. Pushing the most expensive item on the menu to a customer b/c they came in with a groupon & not b/c it really is good is a tad bit tacky in my opinion.

They struck out big time with us & I have a hard time understanding how they have managed to survive in the Henderson/Vegas Restaurant market charging $$$ for $ food."}
{"text":"First time here. Heard great things and they were right. We both had Hanger Steaks. Done right, tender, good flavor. The mashed potatoes had a good herbed flavor. Broccoli was too raw for our liking but all places serve it that way. 

Nice atmosphere. Quiet so we could discuss the day. We look forward to taking friends there soon."}
{"text":"Came her 11/11 for their Saturday BOGO deal, which actually is a great deal. They do charge the higher of the two but it's still BOGO :) Nice atmosphere and friendly staff. I got the fish tacos (comes with 2) and felt like being healthy so got a side salad (which was additional $2). The usual sides are chips or fries, which their chips are pretty good; the fries are fries hah. The salad was flavorful and the tacos were great! I would definitely return on a Saturday to explore the menu.  Many people around got their steaks, which is the biggest portion of steak I think I've ever seen haha. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I knew we'd found the secret best deal spot in town when I walked in and the average age in the dining room was 70 or so. The social security set knows where to get the best food deals in town, and in this case they picked a place with damn tasty food as well. 

As far as the more \"moderately priced\" steak type places in town go, take a date to Twin Creeks. If on the other hand you're an old married couple just looking for good meat - this is your spot ! 

Tuesday night is incredible. All entrees are buy one get one free! This makes their normally reasonably priced steak dinners ($25ish for a filet mignon + 2 sides) INSANELY priced. $12.50 for a filet mignon and 2 sides? WHAT?

Let it be known that I'm a steak snob. I've tried to do the $9.99 steak dinner casino rap and ended up throwing it away too many times. I can't do chewy cheap steak. I don't even eat Prime Rib as I find it beneath me. Yup, I said it, I'm the world's biggest steak snob. I went in to this place with pretty low expectations, I mean how the hell can you serve a sizeable filet for $12.50 with sides? The steak here blew me out of the water! SO TENDER, so perfectly cooked, so quality. It was crazy. Honestly it was just a couple ticks below a filet at Hanks. I asked for double green beans to avoid the carby potatoes and they were happy to oblige. The husband got a HUGE ribeye and also liked it, but it wasn't as money as my filet. It was really really good for a cheap ribeye, but it wasn't anywhere close to a Hank's ribeye if you catch my drift. The filet is where it's at!

The dining room is comfortable (it's like a lodge inside) and service was really awesome. Wine was fairly priced (we had a fabulous bottle for just $24 that retails for $16! Very low markup for Vegas). They also have very creative specials (think duck, inventive salmon dishes, etc - they post them on their website ahead of time). Unfortunately I've only had this $12.50 Filet mignon dinner once so I'm scared it was a fluke but I really hope it's not . Sometimes in life you don't get what you pay for - you get so much more ! A bottle of wine and 2 steak dinners with sides and bread for $50ish? Crazy I tell you."}
{"text":"Have you ever tried something so good you end up licking the plate when no one is watching?! 

~eating and seeing is believing.... I came here tonight with my groupon and before I went I checked the yelp reviews and it was mediocre. But nonetheless I went, I saw, I smelled, and I ate. Mmm it was sooo good!!! I ordered the 22oz ribeye (medium rare) with the cheddar jalapeno mashed potatoes served with a side with their BBQ sauce. The meat was so tender, juicy, and perfectly seasoned, to be honest it was one of the better steaks I've had in Las Vegas! My hubby ordered the full rack of ribs with seasoned fries. This dish was so succulent as well! Charbroiled ribs, falling off the bone.... The sauce they use is a 'ketchup' and sweet tasting BBQ sauce.... Very good! I forgot to mention as an appetizer we ordered the spinach and portobello dip served with warm, soft garlic parmesan bread... So fresh & so big!!!!

Please try this place for yourself!!!! The prices are kind of high without the discount, but u can go for their happy hour for half the price we would've paid!!!"}
{"text":"The vibe at Black Mountain Grill is super cozy and warm, with the bar in the main section of the restaurant and the private rooms along the sides. The service is definitely on-par with a high quality restaurant, but with a huge party like ours, all the staff members seemed to just walk by several times without really checking on our guests.

I ordered the Extreme Mac & Cheese ($15.95) upon recommendation of my friend, and it has chicken, bacon, wild mushrooms, campanelle, and white truffle oil. Honestly, I was disappointed. There was a generous amount of stuff in the mac & cheese but the chicken was dry and some distinguishable kick in flavor was missing. Plus my stomach did not feel great after, but I'm sure that was just my coffee intake.

Speaking of the coffee, when a cup was initially brought to me, it was lukewarm instead of hot. The second time they refilled, I finally got hot coffee. Rule number one when someone needs coffee... serve it hot.

My friends have given this place great verbal reviews, and while I would actually come back here and give it another try, my first experience was not all that filling or fulfilling."}
{"text":"Great basic Angus burger. Perfectly cooked. Salad delicious. Buffalo shrimp was Spicy and spot on. Service was friendly and spot on. I'll be back. Joined VIP club. Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"We had a gift certificate here but when I looked at the 3.5 stars, I was pretty scared. My expectations were very low. We sat at the dining area instead of the bar but since we wanted to do happy hour, we had to move to the bar. 

Garlic Parmesan Fries:
Part of happy hour. Crispy, hot, garlicky and yummy fried potatoes. I wish I didn't have to share. 4.5/5

Beef Satay:
I was craving something with peanut sauce and my back up plan was to go to the Vietnamese restaurant across the street in case this was horrible. This was in their appetizer menu but it came with rice so, it's a meal! But then again, I don't eat rice. Huge chunks of plump medium rare beef and a nice peanut sauce to dip them in. I was pleasantly satisfied. 4/5

Bacon Cheeseburger:
The patty was pretty thick and really juicy. The bacon strips were nice and crisp. 4/5

Nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Try the Hanger Steak Sandwich. Steph Kim Danny Sarah are my favorite! They make you feel at home and are very personable. Good drinks good food good people... what more could you ask for?!"}
{"text":"**Summary**
       - Taste - The food is delicious. Every dish we got seemed a step above their counterparts elsewhere.
       - Decor - Even though half the restaurant is a bar, the place looks and feels like you're in a half-fancy lodge. The kitchen is open to the dining area so you can see your chefs at work.
       - Service - Unfortunately, it seems that everything takes a long time. The staff is friendly, but just absent most of the time.
       - Nightly Dinner Specials - They have a different special every night. You can get a list online. A lot of them read and taste like gourmet dishes at much more expensive places.
**Promotions**
       - Tuesday 3pm-9pm - Buy one dinner, get one half price.
       - Saturday 11am-2pm - Buy one lunch, get one free.
**Ordered**
       - $7.00 Caesar Salad - Decent salad with phenomenal homemade croutons. I could not get enough of those croutons. They were large, cheesy and perfect (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TKcq0hOqesiDOwQb-ZwFAw?select=G2RCzbxFAZrpXEJOynZSYQ#G2RCzbxFAZrpXEJOynZSYQ).
       - $11.00 Beef Sate - The beef is sliced steak and the peanut sauce has an Americanized peanut butter taste. I liked it. The steak can be eaten with or without sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TKcq0hOqesiDOwQb-ZwFAw?select=YoEwbSS4Hp6YnnPzbxnhnQ#YoEwbSS4Hp6YnnPzbxnhnQ).
       - $12.00 BBQ Chicken Pizza - A healthy sized pizza that could rival CPK's (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TKcq0hOqesiDOwQb-ZwFAw?select=JgIQqsfSiL5VTJOlKU1oQw#JgIQqsfSiL5VTJOlKU1oQw).
       - $19.00 Glazed Short Ribs (Weekly Dinner Special) - One of the best short ribs I've ever had. The glazed red wine sauce was incredible. It leaked onto the mashed potatoes and made the mash taste great too. My only disappointment was the portion size of meat (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TKcq0hOqesiDOwQb-ZwFAw?select=axUXkeWofs-3nURvCguR6w#axUXkeWofs-3nURvCguR6w).
**Recommendations**
       - I'd recommend this place if you have a little time. Their food is delicious and worth the wait."}
{"text":"I have heard many wonderful comments about BMG and have ignored the mixed ratings on this place. I came here with my sister and one of her friends for lunch. In no rush, we just ordered a few items for the table and shared. 

The spinach and mushroom dip is by far the best item. It does not feel as heavy or taste as creamy as most dips. It was not weighed down by cream cheese or mayo and had the consistency of a light creamed spinach. Most of the other items were either bland or off putting so we just dressed everything in it. Since we were unsure about what to order, we decided on  a mixed grill plate. The ribs were fall off the bone tender. The chicken was moist and possessed the most flavor. The sausage was nothing special. The filet was the biggest disappointment. It did not have any taste and not cooked to our specification. This platter comes with mashed potatoes and veggies. We asked for the jalapeno cheddar potatoes and it was a huge mistake. My sister was dying and I just taste anything but jalapenos. The consistency was close to the stuff from a box. Our last item was the steak salad. The dressing was sparse and flavorless. Parboiled potatoes also top the salad. Everyone thought they were pears or apples and was shocked by the crunchy tuber...

The overall experience was mixed, but one thing we all agreed on was our love of the dip. It is definitely worth going back for that."}
{"text":"I have been to Black Mountain Grill several times and have always thought that the food and service were OK. Not amazing, but OK. My family loves this place so I end up going more often then Id like on their behalf. My most recent visit there was so bad that even my family who loves it were disappointed and commented on how bad it was.

When four of us walked in we stood at the podium for a while before someone acknowledged us. We were sat by a guy who reappeared a few minutes later saying, \"Oh, I guess Ill be your server.\" Wow, good start. Our entire time there he seemed impatient. I had gone in planning to order something I had seen available on the menu online. When I arrived it wasnt on the menu in the restaurant. I asked about it and he just shrugged like he had no idea what I was talking about. OK. 

When we eventually ordered my mother ordered an entree they were out of which he hadnt told us about. Upon prompting he then told us about the other things they were out of and acted miffed when we needed more time to make second choices. After ordering (and after receiving our appetizers) we asked for some bread. Again, he was miffed. 

When we got our food it was just meh. Ive always thought their food was a bit corporate and unimaginative, but this was just boring. I ordered the salmon and it was literally just a piece of salmon on some plain, white rice and some bland, blanched broccoli. The other entrees looking similarly plain. The grand finale on our night was having our server give us a dessert menu and then not coming back to see if we wanted anything for 20 minutes. Awesome."}
{"text":"Had a couple beverages, salads, Cowboy steak and full rack of ribs. Everything was great and the food was awesome."}
{"text":"Well... I tried to like this place; as my family liked it and brought us here.
Honestly... I don't know what the draw is. They have liquor and sports TV. I guess that's it; if that's all you want. Food is mediocre at best. We had Italian Sausage Sliders(on mini hot dog buns), the Feel Good Wraps and onion rings. The sliders were okay. The wraps had little flavor and I gave up halfway through. 
The service was mediocre... and We had to flag down others servers for assistance.... on a Sunday evening when it was slow. Slow, even with a local football game on!  I think that's a sign of times gone by for this establishment. I'm sure a patron can have a good experience here if they ordered other dishes perhaps... or had better servers... but not for us. We'll avoid Black Mtb... 2 stars... life is short."}

{"text":"We were waiting on our dinner reservation and decided to pop in here quick ! It was such a cool feel ! A locals place through and through ! The bartenders were nice but the people sitting at the bar were nicer ! Met this older couple that live near by they were so nice and welcoming ! 
The prices weren't so bad either 
$5 for a bear ... not bad !"}
{"text":"We went out of our way to go here due to a special voucher that the other couple had received. It has nice decor and near great shopping. There was good variety on the menu. I had the asian salad which had a very light dressing. They did not skimp on the chicken. The hubby had a burger with delicious fries.  We had a very friendly waitress. Everyone enjoyed their meal. We would definitely return, with or without voucher."}
{"text":"I came here late on a weekday evening. We were seated immediately, as the place was not busy at all.  From our seats in a booth we were able to see the action in the open kitchen, which was nice.  The place is clean and nicely decorated, and our server was extremely attentive and polite.  I eat a mostly vegetarian diet (in fact, mostly raw these days) so I had to request some changes to the salad I ordered. There was no problem with my request at all and I received my altered salad without a hitch. My companions had steak, chicken wings and salad, all of which were praised. I would suggest this place to  friends or family, especially if they like meat."}
{"text":"Came here with friends who know it well. Thought the hangar steak was spot on and my beloved really enjoyed the the onion soup. Service was enthusiastiic Coststs were OK, but there were no low cost options"}
{"text":"Hands down this is our new place for a great local steak dinner. Paul was an amazing server extremely knowledgable about the menu. Get the big ass pretzel you won't regret it."}
{"text":"A neighborhood meeting place with OK food and an OK wine selection. If I could do a 2.5 star rating, I would. As I cannot, I am erring on the side of of edible.

Let's start with the bad news.

The cons: 

Aside from my two favorites and a dessert (see below), the rest of the food seems to be middle ground. My friend had the italian-style stuffed chicken which he seemed to really enjoy but, when asked, said it was \"OK, tasty, not mind-bending.\"

The stuffed mushroom entree? Not so much. The portobellos were flat (whether they had the been squashed in transport or storage, or whether they were flattened in the cooking process, I am still unsure) and a little tough. The cheese, which sounded good on paper, just doesn't melt the way one would hope. The dish also cooled quickly or wasn't that hot to begin with. I wanted to like it; I went in to try this specific dish. I was disappointed. 

I have done meals here, snacks, wines and desserts. It's not a bad place, per se, but it's not an \"oh, man, you have to try this place\" kind of place. It's... average.

Price is a con. What you get and what you pay? Big disparity. I can think of a handful of places in the same general area that offer better food at better prices.

The pros: 

The staff is always friendly and happy to help. Some of them are a little overzealous (I do not need to see them every three minutes) and some are so laid back you have to smile or wave to get them to come over if you need something. It all balances out, however, and overall the service is, well, decent.

The cheese plate and the crab cakes are my favorites, and I would be happy ordering just these whenever I go. They are fresh, prepared well, presented beautifully, and very, very tasty. (Also, on the price issue, fairly well balanced, I think). 

I also enjoyed a taste of their creme brulee (they sometimes have different flavors and I am not sure which we had): creamy, not too heavy, and flavorful. The sugar crust was perfect.

WINE!

Wine Wednesdays help. Buy 2 entrees and get any - I was told ANY - bottle of wine for half off. They have a half-decent wine list and some of them have good prices already. Get a bottle for half price to go with your meal? Even better!

The atmosphere is totally doable. The dining room and outdoor patio (fireplace is a plus) are pretty basic yet comfortable, but there is also a mountain-lodge-inspired living room area that's cozy and a bit quirky. The bar is spacious without feeling like you are too far removed. Good for just you, a couple, or a group, there's a space for everyone."}

{"text":"Treated myself on Mothers Day 2016

Bacon wrapped shrimp app was good. 
Filet was perfect medium as I ordered. My waiter recommended the sauce on the side and it was very good. 
Green beans were perfect not over or underdone. 
Baked potato was good; hard to mess up, I know. 
Creme brûlée was good & larger than most places. 
Lemon drop martini was strong & delicious... Had to nurse it from app to dessert ... Yes, I had to. 

Service was very, very good ... Not quite 5 stars since I had to ask for my \"complimentary\" bread as I was eating the steak. 

I'm having 1/2 the potato & 1/2 the steak for tomorrow's lunch."}
{"text":"First time here and pleasantly surprised with the food! Had their signature burger, done perfectly med, and it was delicious.  If you sign up for their app, you get a free appetizer...bacon wrapped shrimp was my selection!! These were kind of tough, but OK. Service was excellent.  There is a sewer odor in the building from the area and the door had to be propped open...was a little too cool for that, but it helped with the odor. i will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late night dinner.  However when your food comes out and there is black material (from someones uniform) and you bring it to the attention of the bartender and he takes it throws it out and says nothing.  No sorry about that or can i get you a new one....NOTHING.....will never go back....So if the owners wonder why there graveyard shift is always dead this could be a reason.  Hire some competent people.  I will never step back into that palce again there are to many other bars around with employees that actual care..."}
{"text":"ONLY $14. COWBOY PORTERHOUSE STEAK... cant beat that there happy hour menu is THE BEST ive seen.. ive een coming for over 9. Year to this place even though its on the opposite side of town for me its soooo worth it"}
{"text":"Every time is come to town , I get there cowboy porterhouse and their amazing dessert , a disclaimer , serves 6-8 people but this fool ate it all, brownies cookies ice cream fudge whip cream"}
{"text":"Nothing really to write home about this place other then it's the 2nd closest bar to my house which is always a plus. Went here the other night for some late night happy hour food and it was ok. My burger was a little on the done side but the fries kicked ass!

Mind you, the burger was a great deal at $4 but then again, I would not have paid more then that for what I received."}
{"text":"OK, we'll start with their Happy Hour every day from 2-7!!!
With way decent prices such as $4 wine, $3 pints and a $6 burger! I was greeted upon entering and offered menus. 
I made a beeline for the patio as I'm a patio kinda gal. It's a cool area with a relaxing fountain, a fireplace and some comfy looking couches as well as regular tables. The downside is this is where smokers congregate! Yuck-y.

Well, the $4 wine sort of appeased my distaste for the smoke. I didn't order food but my dining partner enjoyed a burger with fries, and it looked very decent. We even got the happy hour prices on the patio, though I was informed you had to be at the bar to get those prices.
Good for them, because a gaming bar really shouldn't restrict where happy hour is, right???
Thought so. 
The decor really isn't too bad, it's a lodgey theme and they decorated for Halloween, which scores major points with me."}
{"text":"Mia is the manager and is very pretty and super nice. The food and drinks are top notch as is the comfortable atmosphere. We go here all the time for a great meal or just to stop in and have a drink. The Bartenders are friendly and provide excellent service with a smile!"}
{"text":"Not very good, They are trying to come off as a high class place but don't meet the mark. We went with a coupon from KSHP for $25 for $6. The sign above the door said pints of Bud Light for $2.75 so I asked about them and the waitress said it was only during happy hour or if football was on the TV. Well there was a bowl game going and she said it did not count. So they were $4 each.
My wife ordered a Caesar Salad with chicken. It was like $14 the dressing was the worse we have ever tasted way too much lemon juice. The chicken was just warmed up but still cold.
I got a burger and it was just so so not worth $11 but the fries were good though. Would I go back no not even with a KSHP coupon. 
The waitress was slow and the noise from the grill area really loud, vents."}
