{"text":"Went in for 5$ burger monday. It gets you a burger, no side (fries +3$), fair enough.

I added a poutine, bacon, and cheddar. It was decent, i guess. I wouldnt bother ordering it again. Average meat, not much beefy flavour. The menu said it was a special bun, but it looked, felt, and tasted exactly like the baged grocery store ones (d'italiano?).

Next time I want to try the fried chicken dinner. Girlfriend got lettuce wraps which were....lettuce wraps. I also had a club on another visit which was just ok. We had tater tots and they tasted like tator tots, lazily served with a bottle of tabasco.

Always seems to be a beer special, which is great! Lots of cool taps, usually something ive never heard of to try. The building itself is pretty cool. This is a spot to drink, not eat."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a drink on the patio. The food is definitely average, but pretty decent nonetheless. My hunny and I tried the nachos, and a Cesar salad which is basic but good after a few drinks lol. I have also tried the veggie burger which I loved!! Also their sangria is amazing :) might need a pitcher of that this weekend on the patio... lol :) 

Great local neighbourhood joint where you can watch the game on the plasma tvs, or listen to some live music. They also have some comfortable seating if you want to bring a date here it feels a little intimate but still very casual. Staff was super friendly also.. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Dominion is a great little local pub/restaurant with a great vibe/environment. It's sorely lacking in the food department, however.

The food has several problems: portion, taste and price. Portions are painfully small (and some don't come with sides) There's little to no seasoning (including salt & pepper) and the prices for these small micro-dishes is well over $10 (in the case of tacos, you get two teeny weeny micro tacos with no salad or any side starting at a whopping $12.50 

It's too bad about the food, portions and prices. If it wasn't for the food issues, I'd be here more often"}
{"text":"I live in the area and have been looking for a local. This is the spot. 

Drinks are affordable, the food is well above average for a pub and the front of house staff are energetic and welcoming. I've tried a handful of things on the menu and would highly recommend the chicken pot pie and the elk burger."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The food is really really good and the daily specials are great value. The $4 drink is really good value too. The staff are always really nice."}
{"text":"Brunch is a dud, just meh to say the least. I gave it a second chance, but won't do a third.

I live one block away and it is my second time here for brunch.  Both times I am very unimpressed.  I have had the eggs benny, standard eggs plus bacon & toast and cinnamon roll. The price points are all $11 plus and for the presentation, quality and quantity they do no measure up at all.

Nothing special about their brunch at all for a \"gourmet\" pub.  Small diners in this area do far better on all counts. The egg benny was super dissapointing, especially at $13.  Edible yes. Anything beyond that - no way. The two giant melon slices take up the space on my plate that should be filled with at the very least more tater tots or a small salad or coleslaw. They do not even use peameal bacon, just plain ham, which was dry and they give very little benny sauce.  The cinnamon roll my friend and I shared was very dry...but they are supposedly baked in-house?

What is good: to go for or drinks on weekends or after work -- great! They have some great daily specials including Wine Wednesdays and daily pours.  The newly reno'd atmosphere, live music, large patio, selection of drinks and some of the food is great. The crispy chicken sandwich, burgers, tuna are delish to be specific. 

Although, I have to point out their food \"daily special\" price points all over the map.  There are $5 burgers on Monday night and the rest of the week $14, $18, $24 price points. How are those prices specials??  They also need a better selection of shareable apps. Other than the nachos, the selection involves avocado toast and lettuce wraps.  This the food I get to share with my friends for with post work drinks? Major room for improvement here.

Again, skip the brunch.  There are many places in the 'hood to go for a FAR superior meal and the same or a lower price point.  For example, Figs on Parliament & Queen - Dominion can learn a lot from this small diner; or if you want booze with your meal - Prohibition at Broadview and Queen....  they do far better on the food anyday.

Other than the decor and drink selection, this place is very inconsistent."}
{"text":"Loving how great corktown/regent park going out options are popping up! Great place, great drink specials (for my friends since I don't drink) and amazing food! What a menu, honestly wanted to order all of it! The winners we ordered were the avocado toast and the elk burger. There's also space for live music which is awesome too."}
{"text":"I think this place has potential. It really does but it's just not there yet. I have been several times now with friends and some times everything has been good and sometimes little has been good.

Here is the good - drinks can be cheap. Daily pint specials and Thorogood Thursdays means $10 for one bourbon one scotch and one beer. Technically they are serving JD and not bourbon but I'd let that one slide. For a cheap place with drinks I can recommend this place as is.

But on food and service the bag is far more mixed. I have waited at the front of the restaurant for up to five minutes with no host/hostess asking me if I needed a table. That said, all of the staff I have encountered are friendly, I will certainly give them that.

I had the fried chicken sandwich and really liked it, and then I ordered it again and it was dry. I had the chocked bao and the chicken in that was dry too. I ordered the brick hen and the chicken came served on top of soupy potato thing that wasn't appealing to look and the taste was subpar. The hamburgers are consistently good. The fries are mediocre.

In short this place is better than the old Dominion and I really want this place to succeed. I hope they do and I can update this review."}
{"text":"And another update. The lamb burger is one of the best things I've eaten in months. The food gets better each time I return. Must go back to revisit original orders. Love this place in the neighbourhood 
Update to this review. Returned and had the chicken sandwich. Excellent product, one member of the group had the chicken pot pie, also excellent. Keep supporting folks. 
Previous review was only a 3 because of food quality, now I can go here for more than just the booze!"}
{"text":"Since new ownership over a year ago, fantastic!
Drinks are a great price, service is good.. and the weekend brunch is quite yummy!!! And a nice little patio on the east side. Been coming here since they re-opened."}
{"text":"What can I say about my experience at dominion? To be honest not enough because my experience was unforgettable. My server, Lucy was fantastic from beginning to end. I was greeted promptly and I kind you not I had a full glass of ice water hit the table the second I sat down. The patio was great. I ordered the Thai salad with chicken...very impressive so much so that I want to personally thank the kitchen staff, Cory in particular who I was told put my meal together! Amazing service and a great meal! Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Just opened and so far exceptional. Beautiful decor, cool menu, great specials and well trained staff. Welcome to Corktown!

Update:  Super friendly staff, always recognize you and say hello, even managers and the chef.   Food and drink specials are awesome prices, especially for wine Wednesday & $4 pint special every-night.   

Chicken pot pie was very tasty.  Tater-tots are a must.  Burger is on par and 1/2 price nights is a very sweet deal. 

Looking forward to trying the brunch and Caesar bar."}
{"text":"Same owners and identical menu to the Pour House on Dupont as well as a few other places I haven't been to. Apparently the same people who own this also own the insanely old school dirt mcgiver Dom Tavern in Ottawa but there is no resemblance.

I found the food a bit strange. My burger was this weird Belgian mishmash and the spicy tater tots were not that spicy....

Overall, solid 2.5"}
{"text":"When in doubt and not craving anything specific, go to Dominion. Cool decor, great service and really good drink specials. The nachos with wild boar chile are awesome! My sister ordered the Cornish hen and inhaled it and now it's her go to dish! My brother in law always orders the butter chicken pot pie and he loves it. Always consistent and always very good! Worth the visit and support!"}
{"text":"Really nice place for after work drinks.  very decent prices for drinks.
Wait staff are fantastic.
regular prices for lunch are a bit steep"}
{"text":"Yes!!! Reinvented and UHmazing!  Cool decor, great service, killer brunch with $4 mimosa and Caesar special!  Been here twice and I cannot wait for patio season!!!"}
{"text":"Read about this re-opened pub in a magazine and it seemed like a good place to try out.  It's location worked perfectly for meeting a friend.

Atmosphere is fun, relaxed and cozy.  The front room by the window has comfortable couches and high tops to sit at.  There's a second room in the back with more typical tables - it's pretty hidden and I didn't even notice it until I was seated in it!

We visited on the weekend during the brunch menu although neither of us actually ate brunch there.  They had a special 'all you can garnish' caesar station for the day that, had I actually liked caesar's, would have interested me greatly.

I selected the homemade chicken pot pie - it was absolutely delicious.  It came with a small salad and was a great portion size.  My friend had the fish tacos which were advertised to be an appetizer - he added a third for $5.  They still looked pretty small to me.

Overall - good service and great quality food for a pub.  I'd like to go back and try a few other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Dominion Pub and Kitchen is a decent, fail-safe joint for a pint and hearty food. It's not mind-blowing and it's unlikely you'll find anything superbly memorable. However, it does it's job in filling your tummy with standard pub fare that's actually portioned well without you reeling from excessive grease and sodium.  Plus, the floor staff are amicable and the warm lighting is a long-awaited alternative to the dim lighting you usually have at other pubs.  My crew of seven left feeling satisfied and full, and that's all that matters.  

Tip: This is a great location for dinner during the annual Christmas Market at the Distillery District when you can't get a reservation from one of the restaurants inside the district.  It's about a 10 minute walk from the market and is open late. 

Tip: I wouldn't recommend the peppermint cheesecake. It tasted highly artificial and even my friend who usually eats everything without complaints could not stomach it.  Go from the bread/toffee pudding instead!"}
{"text":"Pros: Tasty food, reasonably priced, great drink deals, friendly service, cool decor. 

Cons: Live music was very loud, draft beer menu lacking local craft scene. 

Verdict: Would recommend."}
{"text":"Came as a group on a Saturday afternoon. From the outside, it's pretty low key and unpretentious.

You enter into a bar area which was surprisingly crowded, we were then led to the back where we had our reservation table ready. The dining area was very spacious compared to the front bar area. 

Aside from their brunch menu, they also have some daily menu. They actually have a \"make your own Caesar\" station. I didn't try this out as I have no clue what to put in there. 

I ordered the superfood salad, which was huge. It was very well made, good balance of the green leafy (kale) and the pomegranate and cranberries etc. One little disappointment though- on menu it says the dressing is a house made curry dressing. I didn't really taste any curry flavour. Kinda of taste just any regular vinegerate to me.

The service was prompt considering we were a big group. She also helped us take some photos and patiently divvy up the bills. I do wish the waitress can keep an eye on our water level and refill accordingly instead of being asked. But I figure we are kind of very far in the back and that's why it's hard to keep up

They have some very cute old archade game in the place like Pac-Man, really nostalgic lol"}
{"text":"This is a solid 3.5/5 star rating with a chance to become a 4.0 in the future.

The newly revamped Dominion Pub and Kitchen was a warm atmosphere, a good selection of drinks, and a new pub menu.

We sat on the patio and it was a good time as we were met with friendly and attentive service.

I tried the lamb burger and it was done right.  Couldn't fault anything with it.  The sriracha mayo spread was a nice complement.

I also like trying different caesars from different establishments and saw the pork belly caesar on their menu.  The all-natural Walt's caesar's mix was a nice surprise but I think this drink needs more pork belly! :-D

Good experience and would come back again in the future."}
{"text":"Food is lacking big time. The $19 \"surfs up\" burger was a total let down. How can you screw up a burger?!  It had an anemic patty and overall the burger was very dry. Bun was pretty much burnt. My wife ordered the mac'n'cheese. It was screaming for more cheese. The cheese was almost non existent!  Fries are good and the service was very attentive but overall it was very very mediocre lunch.   Want great pub food? Head over to Queen and Beaver on Elm street! They blow this place out of the water."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is spacious and relatively airy for a city pub. I had a Brickworks Cider which was light and refreshing. My friend and I both had Moroccan Veggie Burgers, mine with a gluten free bun. It was fresh and tasty. The fries were a little bland but it's probably a good thing (less salt). The wait staff was very friendly and helpful. This is a good neighbourhood place with a nice crowd."}
{"text":"This place has a nice vibe and good service.  The craft beer selection is fantastic.

Where this place lacks is the food.  We had the scotch egg which was not that great.   Also had the spicy lamb burger.  Not spicy, small, a bit dry and not much flavour.  Upgraded to poutine for the side.  Very basic poutine.  

Not a terrible experience overall, but probably won't go back."}
{"text":"2.5 Stars.   Patio & location great. Beer tasty and good price.  Don't order  the Spicy Thai Salad unless you are a fire eater. It was too spicy but I ate half of it because I was starving. When I complained and asked the server for bun or bread to get the heat out of my mouth and throat, they charged me another $2.50 for the bread.  Aside from being too spicy, the combination was underwhelming: very few noodles and tasteless mango. Maybe this was bad luck or the kitchen needs a re-boot, but I won't go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic find on Queen East! 

I absolutely love the decor. Just like Pour House in the Annex, it is rustic yet modern. The interior looks like something you would find in Brooklyn, which I absolutely love. 

Atmosphere is cozy and friendly. Waiters and bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. I also love the open kitchen concept! 

I will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"We were there at about 10pm and got the late night card. I had the lettuce wrap and it was seriously so good! Best thing I had in a long time! You definitly gotta try that!
Good selection of beer, super nice waiter and resonable prices - can only recommend!!"}
{"text":"Cool decor, warm and inviting neighbourhood pub. Food is consistently good and service is great!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and average food. 
Perfect for an after work drink and snack."}
{"text":"First off this is a great addition to the neighbourhood. The place has great decor and the staff is amazing. They are doing everything a front of the house staff can do in order for you to enjoy you visit. The food is the miss here. The burger bun was dry and the wings are not crisp and the buffalo sauce was lack lustre. The place is new so I hope they figure the food out soon."}
{"text":"Patio is nice.  Like the new interior. Lots of space.  20+ beers on tap.  Interesting menu. Will try again."}
{"text":"I had a great time at the Dominion Pub. I was here to watch one of the eurocup games in the afternoon, just when the pub had opened. I sat on the large couched by the entrance and there was two tvs in my view. While there weren't many patrons in the front part of the restaurant, we were served quickly and checked on an appropriate number of times. 

The waiters and waitresses were knowledgeable about the drinks they had in stock and could recommend us ones to try. We ordered the trifeca of poutine and thought they were all spot on."}
{"text":"Reasons I like this bar:

One of the better beer selections in Toronto.

Large patio.

$5 burger Monday. Cheap beers on tap.

Tons of space. Between the bar, patio, front room, and back room, you should be able to find a table.

Some of the cleanest bar bathrooms in all of Toronto. Downtown has so many basement horror bathrooms.

Nice decor. It feels like I'm in Brooklyn, only it's not cramped like Brooklyn.

This fills a gap in a neighborhood without many other options. Let's be honest about how I'd go here even if it was awful, because there's no competition. Luckily, this is a great spot."}
{"text":"This is a great little go to spot on the East side. Good vibes, drinks, and an awesome patio. The food could use some work. The salads are huge and good value, and every brunch item I've had is excellent. Some of the lunch/dinner entrees are just mediocre though. 

The servers are friendly and efficient and there's never a wait."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Food was good. I had the pot pie and fried kale the other day. They were solid. Good service. And seriously you can't beat the $4 daily tap."}
{"text":"Went for brunch and the hostess/manger was a massive cunt to my party of four purely because one wanted challah toast. There are a couple really great waitresses, but mostly the staff is awful. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Great food and great drink specials. Back room of the bar cleared when a rock cover band showed up and started blasting everyone out at huge volume. People came here to congregate and talk, our party would have stayed all night and racked up a huge bar tab but instead forced to walk down to Riverside/Leslieville so we could converse and drink some pints."}
