{"text":"Good wine list ....all special imports !  Food is tasty fresh and creative.  Classics with a twist.   Great service and laid back."}
{"text":"Ate here with my partner, my sister, and her boyfriend. All of us love wine, but none of us are super knowledgeable, so we were a bit nervous to order the wine at a restaurant like this. To our pleasant surprise, our experience was similar to Brian C.'s in that we found no wine snobbery at all. Our server was very happy to advise us and answered all of our questions without making us feel bad. I cannot remember exactly which wines we ordered, but I do remember they were very nice.   For food, we ordered the Leather and Feather and the Charcuterie Platter, to start. Both were delicious! The Charcuterie Platter had a very nice selection and very reasonable portions (not teeny tiny like I've had at other places). I would go back just for that! We all very much enjoyed our main courses (2 had lamb, 1 cod, and 1 steak). And to finish off, we shared the Mignardises Platter. Tiny little deserts, just the right size to have a little taste without exploding.   The prices are ok, not overpriced, but not cheap either. The atmosphere is also ok. We at no time felt rushed and very much enjoyed a leisurely meal, but the place was not full on a Friday night. When I go out on a Friday night in Montreal, I expect it to be a little more hustley-bustley, but it was nice to really be able to chat with my dinner companions.   Will absolutely go back, if not for a full meal, then for a nice glass of wine, the charcuterie platter, and the teeny tiny mignardises."}
{"text":"Service was very VERY snooty. Maybe it was just a bad day for the waiters but I would give 0 stars if it weren't for the food. Very unfortunate considering the bill came up to over 100$!!! We were three at our table for lunch, two of us had the salmon tartare and my colleague took the steak frites.  Once we we were done our meal my colleague had a good portion leftover of fries and a little bit of her tartare left so she asked for them to pack up her food. The waiter looked at her, rolled his eyes and said alright. We stayed there for another hour so my colleague got the little chocolate tartelette and ice cream. Once we asked for the bill a different waiter came with the wireless machines, he explained to my colleague how she should cook her salmon once she got home to avoid any food poisoning (she was bringing some tartare back home). She thanked him for his advice and told him that was her intention in the first place. Let me add that he purposely spoke loud enough to make sure the tables next to us heard every word he said. Once the bill was paid, instead of handing my colleague's credit card back he literally threw it on the table, thanked us without making any eye contact and left. Let me add that restaurant had a couple of empty tables, so this wasn't a busy day or anything to rectify the service. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"The food was fine.  Good enough, but not remarkable. You can get a scallop most places.  They offer misleading coupons on tuango, etc.  Skip it, go down the street to a good restaurant."}
{"text":"Pour ceux qui ne le saurait pas, Les Cavistes sur St-Denis a été vendu (malheureusement pour ceux qui, comme moi, étaient des adeptes de l'endroit). Depuis, le menu a beaucoup changé et est maintenant dans le style d'un restaurant tapas.   Les anciens propriétaires de ce restaurant ont ouvert un autre Cavistes sur Fleury Ouest il y a quelques mois (peut-être même un an,... le temps passe si vite!).  Samedi dernier, j'ai décidé d'aller voir ce fameux nouveau repère. La salle est plus grande que celle sur St-Denis et une salle privée est également disponible. L'ambiance est celle d'un bistro français avec ses planchers en damiers, les chaises basses en bois, etc. C'est bien, mais moins intime.  Les serveurs sont sympathiques et blagueurs. Plus amical, moins professionnel. C'est très bien aussi, ça dépend seulement de ce que vous aimez.  Le menu offre de bons classiques français, tout ce que nous avons mangé était cuit à la perfection et savoureux. Seulement, il manque la touche Les Cavistes qui transformait autrefois tous les classiques en plats totalement appropriés par l'endroit ou des agencements de saveurs surprenants.  Bref, c'est un bel endroit pour un souper tranquille en amoureux ou entre amis accompagné de bons vins. Pour ceux qui étaient adeptes des Cavistes d'il y a un an ou plus, tentez de ne pas comparer.... Bien que tout soit beau, bon et sympathique, pour moi, ce n'est pas à la hauteur des propriétaires et du chef."}
{"text":"Fun Place! Classic Bistro fare. Checkered floor, with huge war times lamps. Service was excellent. Very interesting wine list (all private imports; good selection by the glass). The ambiance is cool. It's a simple, very good menu. A bit out of the way, but in a very nice neighbourhood, with plenty of free and easy parking.  Go there with your friends for a good times and good food!"}
{"text":"Le nouveau sur fleury,a midi.cadre neutre moderne bruyant.carte et plats du jour intéressants carte de vins courte,mais bien en accord avec la cuisine.service attentionné prix corrects.endroit a la mode agréable et bien géré"}
{"text":"Excellent bistro français. Bon service, carte intéressante, menu du jour variable. Belle carte des vins. Ateliers de dégustation de vin offerts."}
{"text":"We stopped in here randomly for some wine and appetizers. We can a great, reasonably priced reisling, and decent cheese and pork terrine. Very cute place to have a glass of wine on st. denise. Also pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"Très bon. Plats bien exécutés et personnel Professionnel et très sympa.  Bon choix de menu."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with colleagues. The place gets filled up during lunch so it appears quite popular. They offer daily special lunch menu which makes the selection quite easy and straightforward. Food, service and decor are all great."}
{"text":"Les Cavistes care about wine. Really care. If you you attend one of their tasting events, you can hear one of the cavistes speak eloquently about their passion at great length. They know their stuff. Their wine list is full of carefully selected private imports, with an excellent by-the-glass selection. And you can even buy bottles to take home.   They also make some tasty tapas and bistro-style meals, but it's the wine list that's the real star here. It's a great place to try an unusual wine you can't get at the SAQ. And the quite reasonable prices make Les Cavistes a real diamond in the wine markup rough."}
{"text":"Really really a wonderful place. If you come before 7 pm, they have a two-course 19$ prix-fixe. I had the cantaloupe and pineau des charentes soup and the steak frites. Not only was it a great meal, but the wines available are very impressive (often private imports). What's more the service is great, the wait staff is knowledgeable and friendly and they explain wine pairings to you when you casually ask for which wine would go best with your food.   A gem of a restaurant, we're definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I liked the overall experience here. It's a good place to sample a variety of wines that are not available at the SAQ. If you order by the glass they present the bottle at the table and give you a little taste before they generously fill the glass. Our table of three tried five different wines. All of which were way above average. The food was quite good. Thought he Magret de Canard was terrific ;swimming in a bold and very tasty red wine reduction. Oysters three ways were fresh and flavorful and fun to enjoy with a nice glass of dry Spanish wine that I never heard of.  Our server was kind and attentive. Surprisingly, there wasn't any wine snobbery attitude at this place... I think they just want you to eat,drink, and be merry. Not too bad on the wallet either about $60-70 per person all in."}
{"text":"This spot is celebrating its 5 years in business this week and has been on my list for almost as long! I finally had a chance to visit with some foodies friends this past Friday, and let me tell ya, I was not disappointed!   Firstly, this cosy bistro in Ahuntsic offers a delectable menu of classic bistro fare with daily specials at a very reasonable price. I decided to go all out with a three course menu starting with an onion soup, their renowned blood pudding and dessert. The onion soup was perfectly sweet and salty with gooey flavourful and generous amount of cheese; I practically slurped my bowl. The show stealer was definitely the blood pudding; perfectly seasoned with hints of clove and great texture, and was served with a tasty purée of fennel and Jerusalem artichokes and caramelized brussel sprouts that were to die for. Finished it off with a mint chocolate torte which was rich and oh so decadently good.   The wine list at this spot is impressive; private imports and a great variety available by the glass, the waiter was knowledgeable with his pairings and even went out of his way to explain some of the appellations and offered insight on how we can get our hands on some bottles at a great deal!   Besides a mixup with my starter which was rectified immediately, the service was smooth, friendly and personable.   The rest of the group of 8 which attended with me that evening, also raved about the place; the daily special of lamb shank was a big hit with everyone!   I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for good food, great wine and a nice cosy spot with a laidback vibe; I'm already looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Francais plus bas.  First I've put a 3 stars but it's really a well deserved 3.5 stars. Not enough to be a 4 stars. My friend had a gift certificate he had won. The service was really good considering it was under-staff. Maybe a bad choice that wasn't suppose to occurs but regardless, our waitress did well. The menu is pretty great. It has some Tapas plates (shared meal) Pretty good. Was it wow? Nah just good bistro food. I think I will give it another try, The plates were generous, good bread. Next time i'm getting wined-up! They're specialty is private wine importation. Great selection, each avaiable by glass. Not that I'm too cheap for a bottle, but they understood the more people drink wines each time they come, the more they will want to buy bottles of their collection for their on to be found. I mean having private importation in your wine rack is pretty cool! They have a store section where you can just buy bottles of their wine, by the way.   Premièrement, j'ai mis 3 étoiles mais c'est un bon 3.5 étoiles bien mérité que je donnerais. Mon ami avait un certificat cadeau et on est allé manger la. Bon service même si notre hôte était clairement débordée. Le Menu était sympathique. A gauche des entrées et entrées pour deux (des tapas) et des mets principaux. A droite les vins d'importation privée. Quelque chose de rare au Québec et qui donne un certain cachet de savoir que nous pouvons les acheter . Sur le menu on peut consommer l'alcool au verre ce qui démontre de bonne créativité pour faire découvrir un maximum de vins durant un repas. Savoir que si nous avons aimer, on peut aussi s'acheter une bouteille du vin qu'on a but. De faire ça rend l'Expérience différente qui lui donne une place dans les bistros de Montréal. La bouffe était OK pas exceptionelle, j'avais déja vu mais bon apprêté. Donc au niveau de la créativité c'est p-e un peu limité, J'ne connais pas la spécialité de la maison mais la prochaine fois je vais testé la recommandation."}
{"text":"Don't miss out on this restaurant if you are in the neighborhood. Great food. Great service. Amazing selection of imported wine. Fun Terrace. There is even a private room for events."}
{"text":"Absolutely beautiful restaurant, perfect for an intimate dinner. The menu is definitely on the high side, however, but the portions are decent and the food was good. Wine was excellent!"}
