{"text":"Great customer service and great food cook to order!!! I definately will be back to try other things"}
{"text":"Generous servings. I had the chicken and beef teriyaki with noodles, which was really good. The service was fast and friendly. Would come back again if in the area."}
{"text":"Good prices and portions. I had the shrimp and chicken combo and a large drink; the total after tax was $10.14.   I was expecting the shrimp to be over-cooked, but they came out hot and tender. The chicken pieces were smaller than their picture board, but we're also mostly tender.    They cook to order, but have pretty quick turn around times. Only thing I didn't like was they had mushrooms in the stir fried veggies.  Would order without them."}
