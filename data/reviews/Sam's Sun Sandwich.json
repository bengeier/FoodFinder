{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Food is delicious and delivery by the owner himself. We had the hummus, baba ghanoush, grape leaves (healthy options platter) and a combo (the stuffed cabbage was really good). In this area we don't have a lot of diverse food options and this place is top notch"}
{"text":"Ordered from here last night.  First timers,  had a fish sandwich,gyro and a Greek salad.  Everything was huge, I had enough gyro meat for 2 sandwiches and Chuck's fried fish on pita was awesome.   The baklava was perfect.  The only negative comment I have is use Greek olives on the salad"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp app and so glad we did. This food is so good and all homemade. We had hummus, tabbouleh, lamb gyro, baked kibbee and spanakopita. Great portions and prices that match! And Sam, the proprietor was so very gracious. He treated us as if we were in his home. We arrived a little after 7pm and ate in. There are only 2 tables available on which to eat, and that was Ok for us. He does a lot of take out, but if you get the chance to eat in, do....Sam is a great conversationalist!!"}
{"text":"Went to Sam's after reading some of the reviews and living relatively close by. Ordered a chicken gyro, spinach pie and grape leaves. Was not disappointed...the food was excellent. Chicken gyro was loaded with tender white meat and the cucumber sauce has a great taste. The grape leaves were excellent as well. I made the error of ordering the plain spinach pie and not the spanakopita that I meant to get, but it was still very enjoyable. Great food for a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Fresh, authentic Mediterranean food and made to order. Cozy atmosphere with friendly owner :) I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great food great family I've been a customer for over 10 years always a healthy option"}
{"text":"Went here because of the reviews here and was not disappointed. I had the chicken gyro and baklava, both were delicious. The chicken was tasty and overflowing from the gyro.The owner was really friendly and let my try the regular gyro meat which was also good."}
{"text":"The \"sandwich shop\" name is a little misleading because it's mostly Mediterranean type food, like gyros, hummus and the like.

But as other folks have mentioned, you would never guess from the modest outside, but this little place is amazing - the owners are seriously some of the nicest people I've ever met.  Try the artichoke salad or the tabouleh.  People swear this is the best tabouleh they've ever tasted.  They have a variety of Lebanese desserts as well - baklava, pistachio rolls, all drizzled in sweet honey.  They also prepare large plates, so if you're looking for a nice, unique dessert for a party or dinner, try this joint!"}
{"text":"10 stars, no 100 stars for Sam's Sun Sandwich!!  Sam and his spouse prepare the freshest Mediterranean food in Pittsburgh and lucky for me it's right up the street... but I would easily travel far to get there because it's so worth it.  Parking is available right outside.  
(There's also a parking lot across the street too.) By far they make the best home made grape leaves I have ever eaten.  Another one of my favorites is the sleek and baba.  Next week I'll probably get the hummus and mujaddarar, delicious lentil, cracked wheat with lots of fried onions. And you can even get whole wheat spinach pies, which I prefer.  Doug's fav is always the chicken roll because of the crispy homemade wrap. I've ordered here for years, for picnics, appetizers for lunch and for dinner. And you can also call ahead. We love Sam's Sun and thank you Sam and Sonny for your hospitality."}
{"text":"Very good, affordable food with a lot of vegetarian friendly options. Very kind owners. I'm proud to support this business. Thinking about it makes me hungry...."}
{"text":"Awesome gyros! Went here for the first time today and was not disappointed. Will definitely go back. Take out is the specialty. Not many seats inside and not a lot of atmosphere but Sam is super friendly and makes this place extra special. Giving 5 stars for what it is, great gyro take out."}
{"text":"This place was great! We got 2 large gyros and a Greek salad and both were really good! Delivery was fast, and prices were reasonable! Definitely would recommend!!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend Sam's Sun, good healthy food for pickup at good prices.  I get the Spinich and Feta pie or the meal combo Hummus, Mujddara and Sleek.  Great local spot"}
{"text":"After driving by Sam's tons of times, I thought it was just another Pittsburgh Sandwich shop.  Eventually I decided to give it a try and to my surprise Sam's offers great Mediterranean food at great prices.  Every time I'm there I get the falafel and baklava and my girlfriend gets the chicken gyro.  

The people that work here are extremely friendly and more than willing to strike up a conversation with you. If you're in the area I highly recommend Sam's especially if you enjoy Mediterranean food.  Who would have thought that the best falafel in town is from this little unsuspecting place on Brownsville Road?"}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh visiting family when I stumbled upon this sandwich shop. Saw the reviews on yelp and thought this is the place since everyone gave them 5 stars. Walked up to the shop and was blown away by the appearance I saw before me. Dingy, dirty, and the display case was almost completely empty. Maybe 2 bags of chips. I saw a thin slab of some sort of meat on a rodizio. Who knows how long It was there. I wanted to immediately walk right out but I was trying to figure out if my fianc√© wanted to still give this place a chance. I couldn't read between the lines and decided that I felt bad for wanting to walk out with all those 5 star reviews. So we got a soda and 2 sandwiches. The woman rang us up and then made our sandwiches. She didn't wash her hands after touching the cash and didn't wear gloves. Made our sandwiches in 5 minutes. For a gyro?! No attention to detail, and when I grabbed and soda out and took a sip not only was it flat,  it was from December 2014! This is the end of March 2015. The bottom of the fridge was crusty. Needs a good scrubbing! I took about 3 bites of my sandwich cause i felt bad for wasting money and proceeded To get a slice of pizza across the street. Don't waste your time here! Big disappointment!"}
{"text":"I'm ashamed I haven't reviewed this place before now. My husband and I eat here regularly. The prices are super reasonable and the food is delicious. As a former vegetarian, I  was a huge fan of the falafel sandwich. It's really good and HUGE. The spanikopita is tops but keep in mind they make it to order so it can add some time to your order. Nowadays as a boring omnivore I usually just get a large gyro. They are just the best around. The owners are super nice, and they continue to recognize us even when we haven't ordered in a while. I've ordered almost every single thing on this simple menu and I can tell you we loved it all. Admittedly, however, we have never tried anything with chicken, which seems to be unpopular here on yelp. I find it hard to believe that they would ever make something I didn't like, but then again I'm just not one to order chicken when I could have lamb--so I guess we'll never know!"}
{"text":"Sam's Sun? How about Fox's Moon?

I know Sam but I don't know his son so I'm not sure why I'm doing this review. As much as I love to support family businesses and as much as I agree with every other of you which says Sam is a wonderful nice friendly genuine man, I really don't like his food. The chicken seems to be flavorless Frozen chicken strips instead of actual seasoned Middle Eastern chicken and the gyro does not do anything for me either. The only reason he gets three stars is because he is so nice and it's family-owned."}
{"text":"I thought this place had the best gyros until i went next door to Family Restaurant!"}
{"text":"The baked kibbi is amazing and grape leaves are second to none. I come here once a week at least. Sam and Sunny are super friendly. This place is a hidden gem that you must try if you like Greek/Mediterranean/Lebanese food. Everything is homemade and I haven't had better anywhere."}
{"text":"Wow, Sam was such a sweetheart! My sister lives nearby and my bf was hangry. I avoid fast food so I trusted yelp to find us some food in Carrick. This shop had mostly 5 star reviews so we headed here.

Sam was super friendly and gave us the 411 on his Greek dishes. We both decided on a gyro. It was overstuffed and delicious! For dessert we went with pistachio roll and baklava. The pistachio roll was delicious but I was too full to try baklava. Oh, he also gave us a sample of his homemade hummus..... amazing!!!

Sam Sun sandwich had the best hospitality and customer service that I've experienced in a looong time. Please don't overlook this shop. The owner is eager to serve you his homemade food while chatting with you."}
{"text":"Best gyro out there. Highly recommend to anyone looking for good Greek food at a an affordable price"}
{"text":"I was more than a little surprised when my adventure partner told me we would be picking up dinner at a place called Sam's Sun Sandwich in Carrick. I immediately web searched Sam's to make sure it met my approval, and I am so glad I wasn't a picky bitch that day!  A sunny day, plus Sam's sunny disposition, plus perfect Mid-Eastern cuisine, plus no picky bitch equals a perfect day (there was also handfuls of black raspberries, eagles, successful mushroom foraging and swimming)! We tried Sam's Baba Ghannouj - which was an ideal combination of smoky, oily and creamy, the veggie grape leaves - which were uniquely spiced and definitely not the ones from the can you get just about everywhere else, and the spinach pie - which was the best fucking spinach pie ever; it had a really tasty dough, not phyllo, but more like that of a calzone and the filling was definitely made from fresh, not frozen, spinach with just a hint of lemony tang. Sam also brought us a sample of his falafel which was probably, as another reviewer mentioned, the best in the Pittsburgh region. All other patrons we witnessed coming and going seemed to be regulars of this very friendly and most worthy establishment."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places ever to get  mediterranean food. It's strictly take out and a hole in the wall in not so nice carrick. But the business is amazing! The owners are so kind. If you become a regular, it's guaranteed you'll get to now the owners. The gyro salad is amazing. Light lemony dressing with perfectly moist gyro meat. Tatziki sauce on the side. Spanakopita always made to order and so crispy and flaky! Hint of lemon too. Baba ghanouj is my favorite! Call ahead and they will have it ready for pick up! Parking usually on the street right in front. And CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"I love love love this tiny restaurant! 
Sunni and Sam( the owners) are SO sweet.The food is DELICIOUS!
I have been a steady customer since they opened!
They deliver too! Please give them a try!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. My boyfriend and I live only a few blocks away and we get take out from here at least once a month. I always the chicken gyro and the bf gets a Falafel and we each get a baklava. It's a must if you are looking for good Greek food!"}
{"text":"Sam is from Greece, and makes the best Greek food in all of Pittsburgh! 

I only wish he would put kabobs on his menu.

My favorite thing recently has been the chicken pie. But everything on his menu is fantastic! 

Stop by and check him out."}
{"text":"Ok. You first have to understand this place is nothing to look at. It's not a sit down restaurant so if that's what you're looking for, don't go here. That being said, the food is delicious and the prices beyond reasonable! Sam seems cool too! I recommend getting take out. There is 1 small table inside for 2 people sit at if you really need to but I think it's more of a take out place. I had the chicken gyro which was flavorful and seasoned perfectly. My husband enjoy his lamb gyro. Also, I love hummus and Sam's did not disappoint! The baba ghannouj was also good but has a more smokey flavor than I am used to. I gave it 5 stars because the food was fabulous in my opinion and I can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"Great place for gyros, meat grape leaves, everything!! Awesome! And Sam is an incredibly friendly guy! Go!!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service. Truly terrible execution of chicken breast. 

I ordered the Chicken Gyro. The pita was soft and chewy, quite good. The toppings were generous and fresh, with a balanced amount of fresh tzatziki. 

The chicken tasted as if it had been boiled for hours. It was dry, chalky, and flavorless. I had to throw away the meat on this sandwich because it was inedible. 

I want to emphasize that the owner seems to really care about this place and his customer's satisfaction. Unfortunately, the food on this day was not commensurate with the level of service."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Had my first chicken gyro from here and so far it's been the best but to be honest I don't eat them a lot and I don't eat regular gyros.  I always get the hummus which is also great.  The owners are really friendly and always up for a chat..  I'm glad we have this place in Carrick."}
{"text":"My mom has been a regular customer here for years and I've been fortunate enough to benefit from her frequent visits. They have always treated her more like family than a customer. 

The food is always delicious. You can see and taste the pride in every dish. The high quality ingredients and homemade options are authentic, tasty and affordable. I love their baklava and falafel. We have taken their food to several parties and everyone always raves about it. 

The service is amazing. They are always eager and genuinely happy to accommodate any special requests and appreciate every customer that they have. 

Our entire family will enjoy being lifelong patrons!"}
{"text":"Sam's is outstanding. This place is a must if you are nearby. The food is stellar, the prices are fair,  Sam and his wife are very friendly and prepare your foods in a heartbeat. I'm in the weekly-bi weekly customer frequency range. I'd specifically suggest the spinach and feta pie, either of their soups, sleek, desserts. The only drawback with Sam's is their use of styrofoams and plastic cutlery :( its not really an eat-in place, but they've got a table and chairs. I've eaten in on near a dozen occasions."}
{"text":"Stopped to get some takeout at another place but they were closed so figured we'd see what Sam's was like.  So happy the other place was closed, excellent food, great price, and awesome service.  Will be back for more, the babba ganoush, tabouleh, spinach pies, just top notch and made fresh while we waited.  Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"WARNING: DO NOT ORDER THE LARGE GYRO WITH EXTRA MEAT! It will be packed with so much of their delicious gyro meat that it will be literally spilling out! 

I am pumped to review another amazing gyro place. I thought the place I found in Chicago was the best gyro, but this place may even top that one! 

My wife told me about this place and we finally went there. I ordered two large gyros with extra meat and some stuffed grape leaves. The lady behind the counter was wonderful and very nice. I couldn't wait to get the behemoths they call a Large Gyro home and eat it. Once I got home I was stunned to find how much meat was packed into each gyro, Every bite I had bits of their perfectly cooked me and their delicious, obviously homemade tzatziki sauce spilling out. By the time I was done with both I was stuffed AND had an additional Meat Salad to look forward to later.

Fast forward a day. I heat up my meat salad and break out the grape leaves. The meat was still delicious microwaved, and the grape leaves were AMAZING, purely amazing. Hands down the best grape leaved I have had since my first.

If you are anywhere within the area and do not go, you are cheating yourself out of one of the most amazing and memorable gyros you will ever have. I look forward to trying other items on their menu!"}
