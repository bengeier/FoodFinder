{"text":"It's unfortunate but I don't think this place will last long. I'm here on Cinco de Mayo and, while it's much busier than it was when I tried it for lunch opening week, it's not jam packed. I've been here over half an hour and have chips and salsa at the table but my beer is still not here and no one has come back to take food orders. When we came for lunch we were shocked at the fact there's not a lunch menu given the busyness of the area. Plus the menu is really expensive for Mexican food. Won't be coming back unless we hear they have made some positive changes."}
{"text":"Ummm...yeah....no.

I'll start positive:  my food was good...not spectacular, but good.  Aside from that I left grumpy and irritated.  Asked waitress a question about menu...got a blank stare...inquired further...got a \"um...because.\" Then she walked off.  Drinks came about 20 minutes after ordering them.  After we ate we waited about 10 minutes for the check....about 10 minutes more for it to be picked up.  After another 10 minutes they came back and snootily said card had been decline (it hadn't).  Gave them another card.  10 minutes later asked for manager as card had not returned.  Manager then informed us their card machine was broken.  Have her cash.  15 minutes later got change and manager begging us to return.  Lots of waiting, poor wait staff.  Get some decent waitstaff with the ability to speak and not be cocky when they make an error and this might be an ok place to eat.  At the moment it is just irritating and frustrating and not the relaxing experience I want."}
{"text":"I tried this place about a month ago. The service was not the greatest but the lady on staff who seemed to be a \"fill in manager\" was throwing staff under the bus about how terrible management was and they had brought her in to help out.... The food was terrible and we had to send the ceviche back after looking at it(grey in color). At this point I figured I would never try it again. However there is a sign that says \"under new management\" so I figured I would give it a try. Well we walked in and there was no hostess. Several staff saw us but just left us standing there. It wasn't until a couple that came in after us went to the  
bar  
and must have said something. The bartender came and apologized but when he learned there was 7 of us gave us a look like \"oh crap\" and said \"oh you should be ok.\" He then went on to tell us the head waitress just left and he doesn't know why so it could be a wait. We end up leaving and going to On the Border where the service was great!"}
{"text":"This place did absolutely nothing well. We didn't finish our food it was so awful. They ended up writing off the bill. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Cannot remember the last time I had worse service, or worse food. Slow service, people who came in 20 minutes after we were seated got their meals before we had received our drinks, let alone order meals. Fajitas we're scorched badly. The order was incorrect, as well. I asked three times for a fresh drink and after45 minutes told her to just forget it. So disappointed."}
{"text":"I guess they have fixed things up since all the poor reviews.  We had lunch there Sunday and it was pretty great. Our waitress arrived promptly to take our order and was very nice. I had the beef chimichanga and my girlfriend had the chicken tostada. The food came out quickly from the kitchen after we ordered looking and tasting great.  I think you should give this place another shot or give it a try for yourself.  We'll be back for happy hour to check out the nachos and margaritas."}
{"text":"Well, we've been coming for Mariachis on Sunday and have enjoyed that. The food is decent. The service is slow for sure..."}
{"text":"Found this place Sunday decide to go in and check it out. Did not look any different then the other two bars, that were there's before, no nothing that made it look like a Mexican restaurant .  Oh except for the music, it wasn't traditional Mexican music , it was whiny and kind of weird . I kept thinking to myself who pick this out. It was annoying at best. The menue seemed okay but nothing special. So I decided to have a Modelo and the queso dip.
The queso was awful,  it was runny and had sort of a sour taste to it. I tried it a couple times then decided it was nasty and I would not ever would have that again. Otherwise the bartender was nice and the atmosphere was nice and the place was clean very well done inside.
 I went home and after a couple hours I became very nauseous start having stomach cramps then vomiting and diarrhea. I guess it was a minor case of food poisoning, and the only thing I can think of that night that eating it would do that was that Queso dip because it was kind of fowl  and sour and terrible. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Meh...No staff, overpriced & distasteful food, very dark atmosphere...Not for me. Smokin Fins is great however!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would.  It took 51 minutes to get served...water!  We would have walked out if it wasn't that we were meeting here for a birthday party.  It took 56 minutes to be served our happy hour drinks.  Instead of the steak Fundido that I ordered, I was served chicken.  The manager ended up covering the bill of my whole party due to the horrendous service.  I will not be back and would recommend that everyone steer clear as well."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE, ONE STAR IS GENEROUS!! I just walked out of this place. Worst service ever. My husband and I sat at a table for 10 minutes before a host walked by and told us he had brought us the wrong menu. Then we waited another 15 minutes for a server who said they didn't have any Cinco de Mayo specials. My husband and I ordered margaritas and asked if they have tacos. She wasn't sure but said she would ask. Another 10 minutes went by. 3 other tables were visibly pissed off. Our margaritas finally came and I'm 100% sure there was no booze in it. The server said I guess we don't have tacos. We asked for our tab immediately. 7 more minutes went by with no sign of our server. Almost an hour wasted. As they say, Bye  Felicia."}
{"text":"Decided on a Tuesday night to try this place. It was previously Nabors. I don't see this place as being around too long. We had shrimp empanadas and Tacos Carnitas. The rice and beans that came with the tacos were horrible. Rice tasted only of black pepper. The beans were undercooked and void of flavor. The carnitas were bland. The shrimp empanadas tasted like they came from a box and deep fried. The menu is way too busy with Mexican, Italian and sushi!??? The bar is slow to get drinks. Probably because the bar tender was too busy flirting with a customer so one of the cooks was making the drinks. First two margaritas were good. The last margarita was pure lime juice yuck!! Too bad. I had hopes for this place."}
{"text":"Went to try Senor Pancho Villa last night the server Maria & manager Dora were great. The food & drinks definitely needed some help, they are under new management & we really hope everything changes for the better. It would be nice to have somewhere in our neighborhood to go to that's close for great food, friendly excellent service & of course kick ass drinks. 
We were asked to come back & try them again on them we will give it a little bit & go back. They need to address all of the issues, bland food, sub par margaritas & correct them & try another soft opening and reach out to the public & offer tastings of new menu. We are hopeful"}
{"text":"I really had high hopes for a decent Mexican restaurant in our neck of the woods and was thouroghly disappointed.... we didn't even have the opportunity to try the food because we had the WORST service ever. We were seated at a table and were not greated by our server for 10 minutes.  She brought us chips and salsa and took our drink order, 10 minites later we got finally got drinks but no one took our dinner order. We waited another 10 minutes and we ask for an appetizer, queso fondito, she immediately took off before taking the rest of our order (which I am now thankful she didnt). During this wait time (another 10 minutes) we were greated by the manager who asked how things were. We said no one has taken our order. Instead of asking if she could put in our order for us she asked if we wanted more chips?  As soon as our appetizer came, which was another 10 minute wait we asked for the check, that was the only part of our dinning experience that had a quick response time! 45 minutes waiting for drinks and an appetizer, what a waste."}
{"text":"First time coming to this place I was a little afraid to come  in because of the reviews I was reading but I was why not give it a chance! came in great welcoming fell like I was at home nice n clean  customer service was great I order asada chimichanga with red salsa n I was impressed it was so good!

{"text":"What a great find! The beef tacos and chicken tortilla soup were delicious. Eric our server was very accommodating.  Highly recommend!!!"}
