{"text":"The atmosphere is very relaxing and the service is great!

I love wine flights and they have four to choose from.  We tried two and they were both amazing.  

The food was excellent.  The crab cakes are very much worth a try.  Our entrees were both great.  Overall, I can't say anything bad about my experience."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner and it was such a great night. Our server was brilliant and made good suggestions for wine/food.
Started with a cheese plate -I had their salmon dish -My boyfriend had the Chicken and Chorizo pasta dish. we didnt do dessert as we were pretty full but they had a good choice.All were delicious. Such unique flavors and they were all presented so well. I will certainly return again as for the food and service we got the prices were very reasonable.
The atmosphere is lovely as well with the open windows and the decoration inside is lovely too."}
{"text":"This is a regular lunch haunt of mine.  

First, I love that I can book a reservation online... they call me to confirm the day of the  reservation ...  and when I get there, the place can be jam packed (as always) but I am seated immediately.  

For me, the service has always been A+.    They push the wine, but that's ok, as the wine I've accepted has been very good.

The food has also been very good, to excellent.  

I'm deducting one star, because SOME of the menu items have been overdone in the \"smokiness\" aspect, in my opinion. 

For example, the salmon main.  It permeates the whole meal, risotto included, rather than just the salmon.  Some contrast there would be nice.  Otherwise, think a smokey jambalaya. 

I'd also lose the TV's showing the fireplace DVD.  Some real fireplaces would add to the ambiance.  TV's.... not so much.  Your restaurant actually stands on it's own, without the need for props.  

But don't get me wrong... the overall experience has always been great for me, and I will continue coming back."}
{"text":"We went here for a romantic date night. From the moment we walked in I was impressed. The atmosphere was extremely warm and inviting. The service was perfect. Very attentive but not annoying. We ordered the grilled vegetable ravioli as the appetizer it was delicious! For the main I had the grilled vegetable bake, which was to die for. My date ordered the seafood paella. He never says anything is \"really good\" its usually \"it's alright\" but he actually said it was delicious! 
I was beyond full after the meal as was my date. But we decide to splurge and ordered dessert. I am so glad we did, we had dessert tasting which was way more then I expected for the price. 
I cant say enough good things about the restaurant. Our bill only came to 110. Which in my opinion was cheap considering the quality of food, service, atmosphere and portions. Definitely going to be going back here for our next date night :)"}
{"text":"We tried this for dinner last night.  While waiting for our dining companions the staff were attentive and fun.  Once we'd decide on drinks (half carafe of red for each couple suggested as an instead of full bottle) nice option more than a glass for the one not driving! Appetizers were ordered and there was a good selection and sharing options. Dietary restrictions were considered and even confirmed by the chef, thanks brad! The mains were plentiful without being excessive.  The apple wild berry crumble was a hit as were the truffles and port. I'd definitely recommend and go there again. One note watch seat four in the corner table there's a hole in the floor and the chair legs fits in nicely."}
{"text":"Escoba is great!!!  I went to Escoba's new location on 8th Ave & 6th Street SW before the Michael Franti & John Mayer Concert at the Saddledome with a group of friends.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that many of the decor and menu features that I enjoyed so much at the former Penny Lane location had made their way over to the new establishment.
Our group started things off with a host of appetizer platters before delving into a great assortment of mains....Tiger Rose, Ahi Tuna, Beef Tenderloin Linguini, Bison and Lamb.  Everyone raved about their meals.  Several of us also had dessert...save room for the Cookies & Cream (like a giant chocolate lava cake topped with homemade vanilla bean ice cream...YUM!).  For those with less room, try the Chocolate Truffles and Port for 2.
Food was great; wine list is extensive and contains some eclectic picks; service is friendly, attentive and knowledgeable; decor is great.  Darren the owner even built a cork wall for one of the rooms using his vast collection of corks amassed over the years.  He decorated much of the former location and I assume his artistic touches are throughout the new venue too.
Our group really enjoyed their experience at Escoba and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Calgary, had my birthday dinner here yesterday. The Food, Service, & Ambiance was fantastic! I had the salmon with risotto, the ahi tuna was exceptional. The risotto balls and fish cakes were good but small.  I would highly recommend this place! 

Can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend (J) and I spent yesterday hiking in the mountains, and as we were driving back in to Calgary we were considering going somewhere for a nice late dinner. We used his opentable app on his iPhone to find places downtown that had a 9pm opening and I read reviews on Yelp to narrow down our choices. When Escoba came up, both with a 9pm sitting, and positive Yelp reviews, I knew we had a potential match. I had been to Escoba several years ago (in its old location) for lunch and rememberd being impressed. I recommended it to J and read some items off the menu and he was sold.

We arrived about 20 minutes early for our reservation, but the hostess was very accomodating and had a table cleared to seat us early. The restaurant was still very full considering the time, a good sign of a happening place.

Our server was very attentive (but not in your face) for the whole dinner, he is definitely experienced at what he does.

For appetizers we had the Stuffed Mushrooms and Prawn Skewers. Both were full of flavour and well presented. J was head over heals for the Prawn Skewers... the sweetness of the prawns and the salty of the calabrese balanced really well.

For our mains, J got the Seafood Bake and I got the Duo of Lamb and Bison. I went with the recommended  Rioja pairing for my meal, but J, not being a fan of whites, opted for a Malbec rather than a sauvignon blanc. My main was delicious. The braised bison short rib was fork tender and full of flavour. The lamb was perfectly seasoned and grilled and beautifully rare. Even the compliments, roasted vegetables and potatos were delicious. Thought definitely went in to every component of this meal. I sampled J's Seafood Bake and it was also full of flavour. I thought it may have been a little overcooked, the scallops were slightly chewey and the tuna was not as moist as I would expect, but overall it was still delicious. The portions were also larger than I was expecting.

For dessert we had the truffles and port for two. I was a little dissapointed with the truffles, they were reminicent of cheap truffles you buy in a box from zellers. I was expecting something more Callebaut calliber.

Overall it was a great meal to remember, I felt like we received good value, and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The service was excellent! I went there with a reservation for 6, but wound up with 7 people, and they were immediately accommodating. They gave us food recommendations that allowed us to try a variety of dishes. The food was so rich and flavourful. They made a mistake on one of my friends' orders, and gave her a free soup while she waited for the fix, plus a free dessert afterward. Truly top-quality restaurant service. :)"}
{"text":"This place has everytging figured out. Whether for lunch or dinner the food and service is amazing. 
They understand the downtown lunch crowd (aka I NEED to be out of here in under an hour) and the prices are completely reasonable given the quality of food. 
Despite the exterior (hello Verns) it is gorgeous and ambient inside. Perfect for a lunch date or reservation to impress your clients. 
Highly highly recommend."}
{"text":"It was a quiet evening. The service was prompt and pleasant.

We shared the charcuterie plate and seafood paella. Both were good especially the duck on the charcuterie plate. There was lots of seafood on the paella and the broth was tasty.

Husband had cookies and cream dessert which was essentially a lava cake with ice cream with a crispy crust. It was good, served at the perfect time."}
{"text":"Super! I attended a company Christmas function here. The place was dedicated to us. But I believe on an ordinary day it would be the same.  The appetizers, entrees and desserts were delicious and nicely presented. The service was impeccable, really superior.  Your wine glass was never empty no matter which room you were in. For a large crowd ordering went smoothly, tables were served completely before moving on, so table etiquette could be maintained. Coat checks went smoothly.   It was really impressive give the large crowd filled restaurant.

Kudos to the staff and management. a job well done made for an enjoyable evening.  I would definitely recommend this place for a company function or a quiet couple's meal.

Oh and when it is cold outside, there is a nice heated parking garage across the road, Centennial Parking."}
{"text":"Everyone, Escoba is back!

I missed their signature mushroom soup and salad combo because it was filling but not too heavy. So I knew exactly what I was getting when I headed here for lunch!

Their Roasted Beet & Apple salad is great, you get mixed greens (not just plain old lettuce), the tart green apple slices goes really well with the earthy beets and there's a nice added crunch from the toasted chickpeas. I'm not a huge fan of rosemary, so they happily substituted it with their honey balsamic dressing. 

The ambiance of a European bistro makes you forget you're in the busy downtown core, even if it's for a little while :)"}
{"text":"You want that cool factor that has authenticity and history well this is the place!!

Great dining room all refreshed cool wine bar and wine list to match it and the food is fun, funky but has favs everyone loves executed brilliantly. Service is awesome."}
{"text":"It has been a few years since I have been here...the first time was a private party with appetizers only which didn't really give me a complete feel for the place. It was well done but not the regular experience intended.

However I recently checked out Escoba for lunch. Impressed! The service was fantastically attentive despite the place being absolutely packed. And as another reviewer mentioned, even when it is busy, you still feel like you have your own cozy personal space. 

I like just about everything but I was dining with a fish eating vegetarian (whatever they are called) so she did the ordering. We opted to try 4 appetizers (Risotto balls, crab cakes, prawns and butternut squash ravioli) and split a roasted vegetable salad. Because our table was small, they put three of the appetizers on one plate -  nice to see they could adjust presentation for table size. The food came in three waves which was nice too. The crab cakes and risotto balls were my favorite but everything was truly delicious. The roasted vegetable salad was huge and had a lot of great, well thought out flavours and ingredients.

There are a lot of other (meaty) things I'd love to try so I'll be coming back. I love that I can make a reservation online (note to restaurants: if you aren't allowing that yet at your place, you are doing it wrong). My only issue with my first visit was how I did need to wait in a bit of a traffic jam at the door while people ahead were seated...it was a bit confusing) and also at the peak of lunch it was so loud it was hard to hear my friend talk...we were yelling. Something I'd expect at a pub, not a quaint restaurant. But it could be that given the time of year, people were perhaps a but more \"festive spirit\" hence the noise."}
{"text":"Went there this Saturday for dinner with a bunch of friends, absolutely loved it! Great atmosphere, we felt very comfortable hanging out, and enjoying our wine during/after dinner. One of the girls with us is celiac, and our waitress, Niki, was great at letting her know what was gluten free, and what they could make gluten free for her. The service, and management there is phenomenal. My friend wasn't completely satisfied with her duck, (she didn't know the differences between how they were cooked) they were more than accommodating for her. I've never really been to a place that actually listens to the customer, and rectifies the situation that easily.

The food was amazing, we had a bit of everything, steak, salmon, and duck. All of it was prepared perfectly, and the plating was nice. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Just reopened today.  Exceptional food at a great price point, fantastic service and an amazing and unique wine list.  Great for both lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"We were really impressed with our experience here at Escoba. The location and atmosphere are really nice. We went for Big Taste Calgary... almost changed our minds once we saw some of the other delicious menu items, but stuck to the set menu.

The smoked cheddar risotto balls are to die for. The basil sauce they serve along with them is the perfect compliment. I could have eaten a hundred. I was told they're on the regular menu so I'd go back just for those!

We both had the 6 oz. flat iron steak as an entree and they were both cooked to perfection. The steaks had a wonderful sauce over them and the rosemary potatoes were full of garlicky goodness and yummy, crispy little onion straws (not the gross French's ones that come from a can).

Dessert was a raspberry lime cheesecake for myself. It looked small, but by the last bite it ended up being enough as it was quite rich. My hubby had a brownie which was fairly ordinary- but they had this AMAZING berry sauce with it that I can't figure out what was in it, maybe cinnamon or nutmeg but it made the whole dish.

We plan on coming back to try the delicious sounding seafood paella and smoked duck breast, hopefully when I am not pregnant so that I can enjoy a wine pairing :)"}
{"text":"Upon walking into Escoba's eclectic and well designed space, your expectations are high. Upon perusing the menu, you'll notice a wine list that has premium prices with food that is very reasonable.

I choose a Spanish red I was familiar with and the waitress insisted we try the \"sampler\" starter. I didn't like half the choices on the starter which sounded like a chain with meatballs, calamari, etc, She kept insisting it was excellent and pushing it. Ignoring her pseudo hipster academic tone, I inquired about the pakoras and she said they were excellent. In fact they ended up with a the best thing we had. 

We ordered a pizza and pasta and both were average. Honestly they tasted like the typical Sysco supplied prefab menu items. I'd take clients here in the future as the noise level was low and I could hear all conversation, which has become a luxury as of late. 

My only other complaint was about the training of the waitstaff;

1. Don't ask your customer what they're doing the rest of the night, it's none of your f---ing business when I'm paying close to $100 plate. 
2. Don't serve pasta with a spoon unless the customer asks for one. It's tacky and uncouth. The spoon was under the pasta and I had to eat around it to prevent making a huge mess... Awkward!

In summary, Escoba is an average eclectic resto in an every growing field of competitors. I found it very unoriginal for the prices paid."}
{"text":"Have been here for our work Christmas party twice now. The staff are pretty good...  always friendly, but the waiter we had was not very knowledgeable about the in house beers.  The bar selection is quite good for wine and spirits. Food is amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service! We went as a group of 8 for our work dinner. They made sure that each one of us got exactly what we wanted. The beef tenderloin was delicious and definitely a favorite among my coworkers! We had dessert and tea after while we chatted and they made sure to check on us if we needed anything. A great place to bring a big group and guaranteed you'd all leave happy and full."}
{"text":"Last night after dinner, the crew was in the mood for a nightcap, so we headed down the street (we were already on Stephen Ave) to Escoba Cafe & Bar.

WHY have I never been here before?!?!? Seriously. I have fallen head over heels in love with this place. 

What's not to love?
Contemporary atmosphere, a European, bistro-like feel, excellent service, friendly people, delicious food and orgasmic dessert.

Another thing I absolutely love about Escoba is that even though they specialize in wine, they don't make it awkward for someone who doesn't drink anymore. The staff isn't pretentious and snobby, and they have just as much selection in food and dessert, as they do in wine. 

Escoba is the perfect getaway. You step in, and you feel like you've been transported to a remote destination somewhere in Europe. Good lookin' food, good lookin' decor, and good lookin' people. Yes, yes and YES!"}
{"text":"We went here for hubby's birthday a couple years ago and had a great dining experience.  Our waitress was funky, cool and efficient as well as friendly.  

I love the ambience... nice, dark and romantic.  Perfect for a birthday dinner celebration for two(or more if you choose)!

The food was really good.  We split the cheese plate and stuffed mushrooms to start.  I ordered the roasted chorizo and chicken.  I don't remember what hubby ordered because mine was so good I couldn't get past it to pay any mind to the hubby's meal. 

For dessert we split the dessert tasting and were in love with all 4 offerings.  

This is definitely a place I would frequent again.  Hmmm.... hubby's birthday is not too far off."}
{"text":"Im kind of between a 3 and four star rating on this one. Overall our experience was really good. We went in for Tapa's and felt more like they were appi's. I know everyone rants on their spring rolls, but it was the paoched pear salad and bison dumplings enjoyed most..
Althought the decor is rustic, it felt slightly dated.  having said that, its nice when the quality of food met our expectations as it had the first time."}
{"text":"I would say food 3* and service 5*. I had calamari to start with and paella and prawn pasta. The starter was average a bit overcooked squid. Pasta was great but paella had curry taste which didn't work for me. Service probably the best in town. I will give it another try."}
{"text":"This would have been a 5 star review if the service had been as stellar as the delicious food and beautiful, modern, clean space of the restaurant. 
I liked the location too as we found parking on the street without issue on a Sat night. 

This was the first choice of restaurant for the birthday boy and I was also anxious to try it out. We like any place with Spanish Flair and the menu read well on line. Escoba is listed on line as Mediterranean Comfort Food but I found many of the ingredients to be more Spanish. The word Escoba is also Spanish meaning, \"Broom\".

I would have to recommend the Ahi tuna Carpacchio and Prawn Ceviche. 
Really fresh, great quality ingredients. We also ordered the Seafood Paella which was a big hit and the Red pepper pasta. Both were perfectly cooked, seasoned and presented very nicely. The shrimp in the dishes were of star quality - fresh tasting and not overcooked.

For dessert, we shared the Tiramisu with raspberry sauce on the side. It was quite good but hubby said it does not hold a candle to Famoso's Tiramisu.He ended his meal with a cappuccino which was small but otherwise tasty. 

The server at times would be disconnected - forgetful, inattentive, spoiled a small birthday surprise at the table but she seemed to be a nice girl so perhaps it was an off night. She also should know not to carry the pepper grinder under her armpit. (Health Code Violation) We also saw some delicious looking bread on a table next to us with oil and vinegar and asked if we could try some too and the answer was no, they do not usually do that. Odd. I guess maybe that is just for regulars? Kind of uncool.

I had requested a nice table for this occasion and we were seated next to where all the coats of guests were hung which meant people were inches from us quite often, coming and going. Not great for privacy. 

The only other thing would be the music - it was.. different, had a strange beat. I would have loved instead some Spanish guitar music in the background or similar.

Nothing special is done for birthdays here other than candles placed in the dessert that you will pay for but that was fine.

TIP - As of May 1, 2014, this restaurant is not taking Open Table resos - they will only be accepting them on their own website. (EscobaBistro.com)

A worthy meal experience but expect without drinks to shell out over $100 for 2 people."}

Service: 3.5/5
Ambiance: 3.5/5
Overall experience: 3.5/5

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

It's been awhile since I've been to a good restaurant and Escoba was unwittingly great! I came here on a Saturday night for a friend's birthday, which oddly enough wasn't really busy. Thus, we had a whole section to ourselves, away from the front of the restaurant which opened up to a small patio. 

The décor is very rustic and 'earthy' - kind of reminded me of an Italian country side manor. Our server was personable and diligent at managing our group of 10. Despite our large group, the food came out hot and in a reasonable amount of time. I'm not sure if I can say the same if it was a really busy night.

I love Escoba's menu because it has so many unique and tantalizing dishes to choose from.  Look to spend about $15 for a tapa (appetizer) which is large enough to share amongst 2-3 friends and about $30 for a main dish. They also have flatbreads (size of a medium pizza) for about $21 and pastas (packed with toppings) for $22. It might sound a bit steep but it's definitely worth the money! The dishes were presented beautifully, the quality of the ingredients was fresh, and the food was cooked properly for the most part. The portions are pretty big so you will definitely leave with full bellies.

The first item I ordered was their 'Beef Carpaccio' ($14) tapas with lightly seared raw beef wrapped around bread sticks with sundried tomato pesto, tapenade, and a side of arugula with balsamic drizzled. The dish came with five bread/meat sticks which I barely finish because the dish became overwhelming salty. The beef was sliced thicker than what I'm used to, but the texture was still velvety. 

For my main dish I ordered the 'Maple Whiskey Smoked Brome Lake Duck Breast' ($29) with butternut squash ravioli and roasted vegetables over a port & pear reduction. There was about 6oz of meat with five pieces of ravioli. I like my duck pink (medium rare), but they overcooked it so the meat was a little tough and dry. Despite that, the dish was still well put together and tasty. 

Other items that my friends ordered were:

- Grilled Atlantic Salmon over shrimp risotto, sautéed veggies, smoked tomato puree, and sweet corn salsa ($27)
- Chorizo & Chicken Alfredo ($22)
- Beef and Shrimp Fettuccini with bell peppers, mushrooms, arugula, and red onion in a basil sundried tomato pesto ($22)
- Duo of Lamb & Bison with grilled lamb loin, braised bison short rib, truffle garlic smashed potatoes, roasted veggies with a red wine reduction ($32). The meat was tender and grilled to a perfect medium rare. This dish is huge though and could easily be split between two people if you plan to eat multiple courses.
- Roasted Chicken and Scallops over gnocchi and veggies in a saffron cream ($27). The chicken was moist with a crispy caramelized skin. The gnocchi wasn't what I expected... it was more like a giant potato nugget that was dry and tough to eat.
- Seafood Paella ($28) which was piled high with shrimp, mussels, scallops, tuna, salmon, lobster, and Andouille sausage.

I had a bit of everyone's dishes and thought it all tasted great; there were no complaints from my friends either.

Overall, Escoba is a delightful place to take a date or even have a birthday party at. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food and service.  I ordered the smoked duck breast with pulled pork hash and my coworker ordered the seafood paella. Delicious and great portions. I also loved that they were playing a lot of Radiohead."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic restaurant in downtown Calgary! I come here frequently for lunch with clients and colleagues, and everyone has walked back to work happy. Who doesn't love a lunch that starts with a wine sample?!?

I almost always have the Escoba salad with prawns - one day I will venture out and come for dinner! Last week, I also had the seafood chowder - it was perfect! Lovely on a cold winter day!"}
{"text":"Escoba is one of my favorite restaurants in Calgary.  The food is unbelievable, but really, I think what keeps me coming back moreso is the ambience.

When you walk in, it is rustic with lots of stone and tile.  The back wall in the dining room also has its unique flair with the wall made out of wine corks.  Nice touch!  The lighting is slightly dim and the restaurant always smells amazing.  Even though it may be jam packed in there (which it usually is over a lunch hour), for some reason, I don't feel crowded in there at all.  The tables are spaced in a way that you are not in each other's space.   I have always felt relaxed and unrushed, despite the hustle and bustle of a popular lunch place.

I have been to Escoba for dinner a few times, but the majority of my visits have been over a lunch hour, since it is located very close to my office.  I went to Escoba with 8 colleagues on Friday and we had yet an unbelievable meal.

Some of my favorites on their menu are the Poached Pear Salad.  I am stealing the verbiage off the menu to make sure I don't leave anything out.  It comes with:  Poached pears, golden beets, pickled red onions, manchego cheese with rhum vinaigrette & crispy Prosciutto.  Yep, it tastes as good as it sounds!  You can also for $7 have a protein added.  Today, I had the lemon prawns, which were delicious.  They weren't chinsy either. I got about 8 large prawns with my salad. 

The soup of the day today was Beef Barley Soup, and it was flavorful and thick - almost like a stew.  Since the soup was heartier than I expected, the soup and salad actually stuffed me, to the point where I had to say \"no\" to dessert.

Our group also tried four of the appetizers, which included: their award-winning springrolls (Oven baked, feta, toasted almonds, spinach with sweet chili aioli sauce), as well as crab cakes (Rock crab, sweet roasted corn, house made guacamole & chipolté aioli), beef carpaccio (fresh bread sticks, sundried tomato pesto, tapenade, arugula with balsamic drizzle) and stuffed pimento peppers (eggplant caviar, feta cheese, kalamata tapenade over basil oil).  All appetizers tasted even better than they sound.  Everything was fresh, delicious and rich with flavor.  

If you are on the west side of downtown, Escoba is a gem.  It is a little on the pricer side, but absolutely worth it if you are looking to treat yourself.

{"text":"Came here with a small group on a cold night. Was quickly seated in a nice corner table. Warmed up quickly with a negroni.

We shared the spring rolls, arancini, meatballs, and bruschetta to start. All were fresh tasting, hot and very flavourful.

For my main I had the steak sandwich on the recommendation of the waiter. Was a bit apprehensive because in the past other steak sandwiches I've had were just too saucy and salty. This was not the case. The steak was cooked perfectly and presented on a single slice of bread. Very nicely seasoned sauce too. Plated with a delicious salad that balances the meal."}
{"text":"I booked Escoba for a bridal shower solely based on pictures so I wasn't quite sure what to expect however the manager: Laurel O'Leary and her staff made the bridal shower an event to remember. During the booking process, Laurel O'Leary was very accommodating. She was very quick to respond to my inquiries and she was also kept me informed about all costs associated with planning the event at her establishment so there were no surprises on the day of the event. I was very impressed by this classy restaurant. The ambience was very warm and cozy. The staff was warm and welcoming. During the decoration process, the staff made the bridal team feel comfortable and offered their assistance anyway they could. The assisted us with putting up balloons, setting up a disco ball, putting pictures of the bride up on screen and so many other things. They were very patient with us and accomodated all our impromptu requests like accommodating additional guests that we weren't expecting. The food was absolutely amazing. The private space we occupied remained private. The waiters were very patient during the ordering and payment process. Overall, I must say that I was very impressed with Laurel & her team. I will definitely be back to this venue for the next party I plan.  Thanks again Laurel! You definitely contributed to making the bride's day special. I hope to see you soon."}
{"text":"My meal at Escoba was great - unfortunately.  It's unfortunate because I hadn't made it into the restaurant before they announced their closing... and discovering something that's about to disappear is sad. 

I had the risotto balls and athena pizza.  The risotto balls were amazing - softer then I thought which is something I quite liked. The Athena pizza was definitely different with hummus replacing the pizza sauce but the balsamic reduction made it work and the whole thing was quite fresh.  They also had a really nice wine list. 

I'm hoping something might pop up here again ... I understand that times are rough but they won't always be and maybe we'll see this reboot."}
{"text":"Food was delish and a wine special helps the price. Escoba is one of those places I sometimes forget about until I am on the west side of downtown. Every dish we had was beautifully presented and tasted great. Server was great as well - with a feeling of a professional rather than just some waitress bringing out the food. Great for a business lunch or romantic date as its not to noisy."}
{"text":"Came here for a late 1pm lunch. Was seated right away with no reservations. Service is fantastic. Our server made 2 recommendations and we ordered both. I highly recommend this place. Though it's on the pricey side for lunch. My friend had the tiger rose pasta and it was amazing! The prawns are gigantic! I think she got at least 6. Not bad for $ 23(?).  I got the flatbread she recommended. BBQ chicken. I would never had ordered this as I am not a huge fan of chicken on my pizza. 

We both finished our entire meals. Definitely would come back"}
{"text":"Consistently good food, service, value and atmosphere"}
{"text":"Too bad Escoba that you chisled me on the soft drink refill charge and one fill on the coffee! 25% of our $89.50 bill for lunch was for (4) glasses of pepsi and (3) single cups of coffee. WOW!

This was my first trip here for a business lunch and everything was 5stars until the cheque arrived...$4.00 (first) + $2.00 (per refill) for pepsi and $3.50 per coffee. 

Based on the chisel I will not return to Escoba and would not recommend based on this fact. The service was alright, the food was alright, the speed at which the food came from the kitchen was unbelievable - way to go kitchen!

The chip I received from the chisel will grow back."}
{"text":"Power Hour Pleasure

Escoba has been in existence for over 20 years. It is one of my favorite restaurants for lunch in downtown Calgary. The food, service and ambiance are absolutely excellent.

The word \"Escoba\" means \"broom\" in Spanish and I'm not sure how it applies to the restaurant but I can tell you one thing for sure.....if you plan on eating there for lunch you need to make a reservation. The place goes from empty to full in about 10 minutes between 12 noon and 12:15pm. The hostess greets you with military (but friendly) precision asking if you have a reservation and what time. Then one of the staff shows you immediately to your table.

I have never had a bad meal and the Mushroom Soup is one of the best I have tasted anywhere. Pair that with a mixed greens salad and a perfectly grilled piece of 3 oz or 6oz salmon and you have an awesome lunch. The menu has a wide variety of full dishes and tapas including delicious pastas.

The service is quick and friendly (thanks Savannah for doing an awesome job!) and the interior is warm and comfortable. You simply can't go wrong at Escoba, unless of course you forget to make a reservation. Even with the official declaration of a recession in Calgary, this place is still full."}

{"text":"Been here 3-5 times for lunch. Very quick to seat you and reservations are recommended as it's a busy place. Food is deelish but a bit pricey for lunch. Service is excellent and ambience is lovely. Upscale but not overly pretentious. I have tried the mushroom soup, wow!  I've had crab cakes, beef fettuccine, tiger rose and the duck breast. All were very tasty!  Overall, I'm full and satisfied at the portion size, service and ambience."}
{"text":"My husband and I came for dinner on Saturday March 5, with another couple.  Husband had wanted to try it because I had mentioned it a couple of times, due to the proximity to my work. 

The waitress was nice, attentive,  social but not overly so.

The food and wine are pricey, but you're paying for the ambiance.  

We all tried the special they had on, as it was cheaper than all else on the menu.  Even then, it was still $100 for two.
Not bad food, I just wasn't blown away like I expected to be for the price

I feel bad for the waitress as I didnt much of a tip, due to my disappointment in the meal.

If you have a lot of money, and want to imptess your date, this is a good option
Amd the staff are lovely"}
{"text":"I work right around the corner so in the past five months Escoba has become something of a regular haunt for me.  

Service is always great but what keeps me coming back is the food!    

IMO there are a few must try items on their menu.  For starters the capaccio and spring rolls are both incredible!  The spring rolls (which are baked not fried so not completely sinful) are particularly good.  For mains the beef tenderloin (literally melts when you eat it) and chorizo & chicken pasta can't be beat.  

While its great and I'll continue to take customers there it does get a little noisy so serious conversation can be strained at times."}
{"text":"We visited Escoba on a recommendation from a friend.  We truly enjoyed the casual ambiance and the request for a nice seat by window was met :)
The menu has a lot of variety and upon everyone's YELP recommendation of the spring rolls - we had to have them!  So we started with those and the charcuterie platter.  Our appetizers were tasty and enjoyable.  
For dinner we ordered the seared ahi tuna and the duck two ways.  Entrees were just ok.  Nothing that was memorable for us.  Tasty but nothing crazy!
I would have been happier enjoying more appetizers so thus we will be back to do just that!
They do have an extensive wine list but wasn't in the mood for a glass but if you are a wine lover, they have a great menu!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Calgary, had my birthday dinner here not too long ago. I was introduced to this place for a work lunch and been in love ever since. The ambiance is really dark at night I find, it kind of puts me to sleep. 

Service and food has always been exceptional. Going to eat there again tomorrow night, can't wait!"}
{"text":"Such a beautiful restaurant inside. It feels like your walking into italy's hidden treasure. Great wine list, Helpful welcoming staff and delicious food"}

I think this may be one of my favorites places in the area... I can't wait to go back there!!.."}
{"text":"We crashed an office party here last night. All I can say is, the food noshing was awesome and under appreciated by the drunken patrons. Waitresses and bar staff were very very receptive and accommodating. All in all, a fun night that I can barely remember. Thank goodness for phone cameras!"}
{"text":"Am I ever happy that Escoba is re-opened!  Had the best lunch ever at Escoba today.  Ordered the Tiger Rose, an old fave.  Deliciously cooked.  My friend ordered the Chicken Parmesan and loved it.  The only problem we had was we waited for 40 minutes for 2 dishes of food.  Turns out a table of 22 was ahead of us!  My friend had a 1 p.m. meeting to run off to and told the waiter to hurry along.  The food came out in a jiff.  The mgr came by to check on us and reassure us.  After we ate quickly, the mgr offered my friend a gift certificate of $25 for her next visit as she picked up the bill.  Way to go, Escoba!  Excellent customer service!

Very busy and bustling restaurant.  Go early is my advice."}
