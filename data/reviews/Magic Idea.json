{"text":"The \"everyone in the group must order at least one drink\" rule is ridiculous. I was with a group of 4 friends just finished dinner and 2 of us wanted bubble tea so we went in and sat down. Me and someone ordered bubble tea. 2 of my friends asked if they can have hot water. The waitress downright said \"NO\"and then proceeded to give us attitude the whole time... we then decided to just get our drinks to go, we paid and that waitress slammed our money down in the back counter and walked away while we were still sitting in our seat a considerable amount of distance away. The actual bubble tea was not bad (wouldn't be surprised if they had spat in it)... but either way, because of the deliberate rudeness of the staff I would skip this place."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food here. Got a tofu and eggplant  dish. heavy on  msg but tasty"}
{"text":"I went to this place yesterday, so March 24th 2013.

DRINKS:
 I got the durian milk with lychee jelly which was good. I was there with 3 other girls and we did all enjoy our drinks. Word of advice, opt for the \"large\" drink unless you really arent thirsty at all. The small was tiny, half ice, and there was barely any jelly. The large only costs $1 more for most of the drinks anyways. Cash only!

ENVIRONMENT:
It was pretty busy there, we went at 6PM on a Saturday and about half of the tables were filled. There were your normal ables and chairs, it was cold by the door but that's because it's Montreal.

SERVICE:
This is where things really go downhill. I would never go back here again just because of the service. There was one waitress for the entire restaurant/lounge. There were at least 10 tables seated. She just wasnt very hospitable at all nor helpful when we asked about drink sizes. When we went up to pay, things got really bad. We were a group of 4 people. All lined up to pay. She allowed one of us to pay and then she proceeded to walk away from us and serve some tables while we were waiting there. When she decided to come back she let the other 3 of us pay, but she gave the wrong amount of change back to us. She gave back $9 when she was suppose to give back $11. When we mentioned this to her, she just walked away and served some more tables, and then came back and gave us $11. She then looked at us and had the nerve to say tap her tip tray and say, \"these prices don't include tip.\" She said that twice to us very rudely. And this was after she just walked away from us twice while we were paying. I was astounded by how rude she could be."}
{"text":"When I first came to Montreal back in 2006, I loved coming to this tea lounge located on the second floor, overlooking one of the most beautiful streets in Montreal.  I savored their Taiwanese beef noodle soup, delicious teas, and view.  However, after coming back recently the vibe is not the same.  The place is now run by one person, an older woman, who is not in the mood to deal with customers.  

During this year, our first visit, we came in and were completely ignored.  Then, I came back the next day and did receive some service.  What I go through just to get some Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup is beyond me.  The teas were not as good that they used to be, and the overall feeling of the place is no longer young and hip.  Before there used to be young customers, young servers, and music videos playing.  Now it is like a tomb."}
{"text":"They have amazing bubble tea (the extra-large size is humongous so be careful what you wish for), and their dishes are alright.

The food was acceptable and the decor was okay. I love how they have many TVs with different sports channels, so that all kinds of sports fans can enjoy themselves."}
{"text":"Delicious and refreshing and doesnt have that fake flavour. Had the coconut milk one and the honeydew back tea. Yum! The place is spacy so theres lots of room for groups of people, apparently the food's also tasty"}
{"text":"Nice calm lounge! Great location!

Ordered the Mango juice with bubbles! its really good and the cups a pretty big! a little cheaper than the average places

I would definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic for hanging out, drinking bubble tea, and playing board games/puzzles for hours on end.  Great location in Chinatown as well as one near Concordia University. 

Pink Lemon-aide is out of this world delicious. Lots of choice in drinks and bubbles/jellies."}
{"text":"I took a lychee bubble tea to go.  It was $3.50 and it was fine.  I think you can get the same thing at Harmonie bakery a few doors over for $3.00, don't know about the size difference.

The place seemed a bit grungy and run down.  There were some well-used looking board games (chess and some others).  Generally, looked like an ok place for teenagers to hang out, have some bubble tea and play games.  I wouldn't recommend it for anything else.

There was a food menu but I didn't try it this time."}
{"text":"Ok, I find that Yelp seldom leads me astray, but I feel that it did with Magic Idea.  Reviews were pretty good and I was excited to check this place out, and when I did, I was so disappointed!

This place is ghetto!  The cushions on the benches towards the back (where the tv is) were all torn and the stuffing was poking through the rips.  The washrooms were really dirty and grossed me out.  

Bubble teas are cheaper here than at most other places in Montreal, with a small being $3.75.  I had a chocolate peanut milk green tea with tapioca.  There was not enough ice in the drink for me and the tapioca were too soft and mushy.  They lacked the chewiness that I like.  The drink itself was chocolatey and peanuty tasting, but I didn't taste any tea flavour.  I forgot to ask for it half sweet, but thankfully it wasn't too sweet.

Service was nice enough and there's free WiFi.

I personally would not return though :("}
{"text":"Small Lychee bubble tea
Fish balls
Small fried chicken wings
Thick toast- sesame
and Sichuan shrimp rice.

$30
Good.  Not great.  But I can see this being a nice cheap spot to hangout and eat for Concordia students.
The bbt is a bit watered down- not as dense as I'd like fresh fruit to be.
The pearls though are very good
And the portions are VERY big.  Good place.  Not amazing."}
{"text":"5 stars goes to the bubble tea!  Strawberry milk tea is great, taro milk green tea is great, or just plain milk green tea sugar free (now that I'm on a diet) is great!  I like the seafood undon noodles soup is amazing there and also I always order the pork vermicilli noodles.  Reasonable price and great for my taste buds."}
{"text":"Very dirty and terrible service; the staff is really rude and ignore customers. The food and bubble tea isn't amazing either. Not worth it at all I have no idea why this place is still in business"}
{"text":"As I mentioned in an earlier review, Magic Idea is one of a few places vying for second place in my estimation of the best places for bubble tea in Montreal.  The bubbles are a little fluffier than I like, but they still have a satisfyingly chewy center, for the most part.   They're just not perfect.

I really like the fact that Magic Idea is open until midnight every night, they have a wide variety of flavors available, and they have a stamp card so after 9 teas, the 10th is free.  I also really love the tall glass mugs, they're just super cool, to me.

You'll often find a lot of Concordia students here, given the proximity to the campus, and the free WiFi.

Unfortunately they only accept debit cards and cash, so if you prefer credit like me, remember to bring cash.  The bathrooms are also pretty grungy.

Overall, a very nice tea room, and worth a visit."}
{"text":"If there's anything you should know about me, I can't go a full week without bubble tea. I was on vacation here from US, and I was suffering from major bubble tea withdrawal. 

I stopped by here after a long day of walking to escape the scathing wind. There was only one girl handling all the work in the front, so it was understandable that service was quite slow. I ordered the jasmine milk tea while my boyfriend ordered their mango bubble tea, and  both were DELISH~ I'm a pretty picky person when it comes to my bubble tea, but this place exceeded my expectations. The jasmine milk tea was on point, milky but also able to taste the green tea flavor in it.  I tasted some milk in the mango bubble tea, even though the waitress told us it had no milk in it. My boyfriend is lactose intolerant, so he wasn't actually able to drink his drink, but hey, that means more for me! :) I believe that they also serve a variety of noodle soups to warm yourself up. They have plenty of space in there, so it looks like a great spot to hang out. Definitely recommend stopping by here for great milk tea!

PS: their menus look like storybooks! 

PPS: They have wifi!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite bubble tea place. Prices are goodand I highly reccomend the cantonese fried noodles, with chicken. They also serves meals and snacks. Its really closeby the metro and John Molson, so friends can come grab a bubble tea and play some cards. Theres a lounge section seated here too, with TVs and plenty of entertainment stuffs. Great for friends!"}
{"text":"Went there a few times since it close to school. Their bubble teas are not the best, but they are still good (also a bit cheaper than the others). Food is also quite good, and really cheap. I think it is a great place to study, since they also have wifi. Service is fast and courteous."}
