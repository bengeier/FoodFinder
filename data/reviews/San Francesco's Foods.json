{"text":"Great pizza, the sauce is yummy, nicely spiced...lots of cheese, pepperoni, and fresh mushrooms.  The service was awesome, very friendly. Looking forward to trying the veal..."}
{"text":"I'm a regular. I swear by this place. Better than California sandwiches and better then the ones in the area. 

Everything is always fresh & the portion is huge

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I work about a minute from San Frans and cant get over how huge their lasagne servings are. Service has always been amazing every time I come, I always get the daily special run down and freebies like garlic bread, free toppings etc. $1 additional toppings for the veal is ridiculous though. Although, I can't pass on the cheese so $7 bucks is a fair price for something as huge as my hand. They've got three levels of heat: sweet, medium, and hot. Medium is always the way to go for me. I always come in starving during lunch so anything hot satisfies my empty belly."}
{"text":"I was walking by on my way to buy some pet food at the plaza.
Saw the hot chick was working behind the counter again.
Stopped,,,,turned around.....went in.....got pizza.
The food was good, the eye candy was good, watched some TV, played a few rounds of angry birds, finished my bottle of water then left.
I forgot to buy pet food so i may be back tomorrow"}
{"text":"It was a dreary night and while I was driving home from work, I was thinking I want junk food.  So I pass by this new plaza called Creekside Crossing at Dixie and Dundas and see there is a Five Guys and a San Francesco foods.  Hmm...which one??  Five Guys is gaining popularity in Ontario now, but there's a lot of them and I figure I can always go there, but you don't see too many San Francesco foods.  

I ordered a veal sandwich for $6.95, which I thought was decent, until I realized that every topping cost $1 each and it came out to like $12.  So I decided to take one topping off (toppings are peppers, cheese, mushrooms and onions).  If it was 0.50/topping, sure, that's reasonable, but $4 for 4 toppings?  That's 80% of the sandwich price.  No good.  

As for the sandwich itself, the veal was cooked fresh, and it was tender, but didn't have outstanding flavour.  When I go to a sandwich place, I expect superb quality since the price is quite expensive for what you get.  It was okay. Maybe 2.5/5

Service: n/a

Price: 1.5/5

Overall, this place is really 2.5/5."}
{"text":"Nice clean restaurant and friendly service. Had a good tasty meatball sandwich on a fresh kaiser bun only for $7.00.  Extra toppings are $1.00 each. Will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Haven't had a chance to compare this location to other's in terms of sandwiches but came in the other day just to try a slice of delux pizza and it was a big slice, very delicious, the cheese was tasty not greasy or leaving you with that pizza pizza musk.  The sauce was really good, fresh ingredients and not over sauced...nice to see all the veggies were fresh including the mushrooms, will definitely be back to try and compare the veal sandwich."}
{"text":"Decided to try out this place on a whim since I already had everything else in that plaza. The guys there were really friendly. My sandwich was huge and sooo good. Came out to about $9. A little pricey but worth it if you're hungry and can eat a lot. Definitely coming back. They have an app that I will test out next time I'm there."}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes for a pizza that looked like it was out of a box. From the clearance bin. At a bottom of the line grocery store. That cost $17 for a large pepperoni. Will never go back"}
