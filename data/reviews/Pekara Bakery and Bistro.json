{"text":"The bread here is so good. Got the baguette from a place that sources their bread from Pekara and froze it. Reheated it in the oven two days later (16m on 375,  if you're wondering) and it was so good I just ate it plain. Made the best garlic bread from the rest. One star removed for sloooooow service and rather overpriced selections of other things, but man their pastries are good. Sandwiches can be hit or miss and heavy. Ambiance is typical locally-owned college town coffee shop, with eclectic furnishings and local art on the walls etc. Outdoor patio seating is great for nice days. Very walkable location, not so much driveable, parking is limited and metered."}
{"text":"I saw a cockroach here once.  Their ciabatta bread and crepes are almost delicious enough for me to look the other way, but I'm a little too grossed out to ever frequent this place again."}
{"text":"Sometimes Pekara is awesome.  Other times, not so much.  I recently purchased a dozen cookies for my staff and they were hard as rocks.  Utterly embarrassing."}
{"text":"What I'd do next time: order my crepe 'golden' to make sure it's cooked enough, and ask for toppings on the side because they load them up. Also, watch out for low grade cheese. But I'll come back for a second visit, definitely."}
{"text":"I like this place so much that I eat lunch there just about every day.  The draw for me is the bread, and the fact that the selection of sandwiches is so large (plus an off-the-menu special every day) that it's difficult to get tired of it.  (It doesn't hurt that it's only a couple of block from my home.)  
I'm not much of a pastry eater, but the ones I've had there have been delicious.  Quiche and spanikopita are also to die for.  Crepes and omelets are inconsistent.
Pekara is *not* a coffee shop.  If you want a capucino, go next door to Aroma or around the corner to Kopi.  But their regular coffee is delicious, as is their iced tea, and their desserts put those other places to shame.
Their regular staff are very friendly and helpful, but (like anywhere else in the food business) there's a certain percentage that is always turning over, and some of them have been less than wonderful.
When I go, I almost always take my dog, who tells me that their bakery made (but not by Pekara) dog treats are the best he's ever had.
I'd give it five stars if it weren't for the inconsistencies of some of their menu items."}
{"text":"The caramel machiato is amazing. The only reason I am giving it 4 star is because it's kinda pricy."}
{"text":"I'm not impressed with the pastries, bread, food or coffee here.  Everything is way overpriced and nothing too special.  I ordered an omelet and got a thin egg tortilla filled with cold veggies and un-melted cheese!  I still go here sometimes when Aroma is full.  They do have free wi-fi and the space is clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"It's a great study location and date place! It's a cute little bistro right in the middle of downtown Champaign. The backdoor opens into a beautiful and decorated alley. The outdoor seating is great for the summer months. It's the only place in Champaign that serves sweet crepes!! I'm a fan of their nutella crepes, hot chocolate, and sandwiches. I'm vegetarian and they were really nice about leaving the meat out of some of their meat sandwiches, or making me a custom sandwich a few times. The place is also very aesthetically pleasing- they have some nice art and photographs hanging on their walls. I've hung out here a bunch of times with my friends. They also have free wifi, the password to their secured network is in front of their checkout counter. Great place!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised this bakery/cafe has not had more reviews. It is one of a very few that actually MAKE their food, including breads, baked goods, crepes, soups, sandwiches, individual pizzas, and salads, in addition to coffee drinks.

Pekara has now moved its baking operations to its own dedicated building (now that says something for a local successful biz, doesn't it?) to do more wholesale for local retail establishments (for example, you can find their bread at Common Grounds Food Coop, cookies at the Latte Da coffee shops in the public libraries and Carle on Windsor and baked goods at Pages for All Ages independent bookstore.
I like their niche; the desserts are homey, yet professional (and they can do higher level European cakes and pastries). They have THE best spanokopita-type dish (much better than Greek versions-more like a spinach/cheese custard in filo), lovely cupcakes, great combos for soup/salad/sandwiches, and savory croissants. Oh, and did I say individual Babkas? Seating is a smart row of two chair/table setups with plenty of outlets down the hall, with a counter/bar stools in front, and larger table combos, couch/club chairs in the back. Warm weather brings a couple of tables in front, and a bricked patio in the back. The only problems I have seen are: parking (now w/the road closed, but at nights and weekends you can use the bank across the street), and sometimes poor staffing (the owners cannot be there 24/7) although this is to be expected with the high turnover of food service jobs. I have noticed that the past six months have gotten better with a couple of 'managerial'  level employees who are keeping the staff professional. This is a casual, nice place to bring someone for lunch, breakfast, a bit to eat in the evenings, to study, etc. It is not a sit down restaurant, and it can sometimes get complicated if you are eating with a group of four or more and you want to pay the bill for everyone (getting the orders in and together).  Lunchtime can get a bit crowded. Each person orders individually and the staff brings you your meals. The food arrives quickly, even the made to order crepes. They do nice box lunches, catering, and platters as well."}
{"text":"Coffee was okay, but honestly one of the least friendly experiences I remember. Apparently my purchase was getting in the way of other work. Only customer there...staff just kept loading the case. Once they decided to take my order, they were still apparently angry I had slowed their work."}
{"text":"This is my go-to study spot. I feel a little guilty taking up table space, so I tend to try to buy something. Their sandwiches are good- my favorite is the tuna croissant. Their big chocolate chip cookies are also amazing. I like their roasted red pepper soup, but I wish they had some other palatable options- I tried the beer cheese soup and it tasted like velveeta. I would also really love if they offered a half sandwich option without another side.The staff are very sweet, although I wish they wouldn't call me \"hun.\" They seem to have improved tremendously on getting orders right, which used to be a consistent issue but hasn't been a problem in over a year. They play top 40 radio, so bring headphones if you want to study there and that isn't your thing."}
{"text":"many people i know raved about pekara, so one day i decided to give it a try. i was disappointed because two items that i had were nothing more than a chocolate cake and a cream puff. the texture was kinda hard and they were just sweet with no other taste."}
{"text":"Breakfast bagel is really good but not super filling if you're very hungry. The pastry selection is very impressive. The music was very loud relative to other coffee shops; too loud to study for me personally. Very cute venue. A+ for breakfast or lunch with a friend"}
{"text":"Had the banana bread again..... warmed it up in the oven.... crack! On a gluttony binge. They also got a great pumpkin bread...... yum."}
{"text":"This is the kind of high-quality bakery that you find in cities.  Everything that I've had here is good.  Their bread is sooo fluffy.  The soup is great, I tried the cheesy broccoli (I love broccoli).  The coffee is fine, not amazing, but not bad.  I also like the random assortment of mugs that you get to pick from.

They just got bagels here!  And they look like the real boiled thing!  Who else understands how big of a deal this is in urbana champaign?  The hours of 7-7pm also make it perfect for a real breakfast place. 

Free wifi and the fact that it's relatively empty on weekdays (unfortunately for them) makes it a fantastic place to work or power-study.  The caffeine + excellent sugar filled pastries keep you going."}
{"text":"A bit conflicted about this caffe because last night I had a delicious cookie and noticed they had a sign saying they serve breakfast all day. So this morning came in expecting a delicious meal; because the cookie I had the night before was homemade (plus on Monday's they give you a free chocolate  chip cookie with your purchase). So this morning my omelet was good but the butter croissant was tough. The coffee was good. The tab came to $17; a bit expensive. But I was still thinking a 4 star would be an ok rating for this caffe, that is until I asked for a coffee refill and the women attending the counter said there is a $.50 charge. I read in the menu that is posted on the wall, that  you can have a espresso shot for $.30 added to your cup of coffee. Up to this point I was still ok with their way of conducting business (although it made me appreciate coffee shops in California that refill at no charge). However I had to take the rating down to three stars because once I asked for the refill and a shot of espresso the woman attending the counter said I would have to buy a new cup of coffee. If the owner of this coffee shop reads this review, please note you should change the writing in the large menu  written in the wall and clarify the coffee refill situation. The customer service was also inconsistent the first time (night) I came in to buy my cookie the gentleman attending the counter was great. The next morning I order my $17 omelette, croissant and coffee a nice African American lady took my order. But the woman with very short light brown hair was not customer service oriented when dealing with my coffee refill issue. I came in happy to be a return customer but left not sure if I would return."}
{"text":"Service is friendly and prompt and willing to give recommendations to customers, wifi is usually functional, and their chai lattes are a zillion times better than the ones I've had at Aroma or Espresso Royale in town. Kopi's is on par for comparison, but I think I like Pekara's more because it's served in a porcelain cup...something about it is more pleasant that way. 

The bakery is delicious, but the sandwiches are a little too salty/heavy for my taste. The same goes for the soups; tasty, but way too rich and creamy. That's a preference thing and I'm sure many people will like it, but just in case others are sensitive to textures, there it is.

Overall, it's not a super-special kinda coffee shop, but for downtown Champaign, it does well, and its a local business with awesome staff that I feel really good about supporting. I also think it trumps downtown urbana shops by a long shot; looking at you Flying Machine."}
{"text":"Pekara's okay. I think the baked goods are a tad overrated, though they're not bad (and probably the best in the area- though that doesn't say much- it's a long slope down from Pekara). I'm not a coffee drinker, so I can't comment on that. 

The food was pretty good. I had a Cuban when I went, and it was alright. It's certainly not as good as Radio Maria, but understandably so. Still, I can't help but think it was lacking something. The soda was also a bit flat. I will say that the french baguette was delicious, and I like day-old bread, so it's great for that."}
{"text":"I ordered a bagel with egg and feta sandwich. I expected it to be pretty plain, just something to eat for a snack or whatever, but when it came I was amazed with how good the bagel was. I was like \"hold up homie, does that say bakery on the wall? Wowzas they made this bagel here from scratch. That's amazing. Can't wait to yelp review this\"

And here I am, reviewing it. It was good. The stuff they bake is awesome."}
{"text":"I've been to Champaign twice and been here twice, so it must be good to bring me back. Their bakery selection is fantastic. I had an apple danish the last time I was there, and it was all I needed for breakfast. Their crepe selection looks great, but I didn't have the time to try one; so I will have to stop in again."}
{"text":"I dont like the cakes but the bread is excellent, at the level of any good german Beakerei"}
{"text":"The breads here are what you might expect at a good bakery in Europe. The selection is somewhat limited, but the quality is great. We also tried their apple almond tart and mint gelato--both were excellent. The gelato scoop is typical for European gelaterias but small in comparison to your standard ice cream expectations. 

They also have excellent tables with wifi as well as salads and sandwiches, if you get hungrier.

I thoroughly recommend visiting this cafe."}
{"text":"I love coming to Pekara on the weekends to study. The sandwiches are delicious. I love the Hot Chicken Parisienne and  the BLT. The Napoleon is to die for and the gelatos are amazing. The food is great, the atmosphere is great. The only issue I have is the temperature. They like to keep the place cool, even in the winter, so I like to wear layers. Anyhow, the desserts and pastries are so delicious. I love trying the cakes treats."}
{"text":"Worst Crepe !!!!!!! Being an European cafe if they don't know how to make a extremely simple Crepe, don't know what to write. We ordered 4 crepes, and they all were bad, uncooked crepe, very little filling. We are having stomach aches as well. Tried calling them and they kept us on hold for over 15 minutes..Weird!!!!  Don't know about other stuff but crepes are HORRIBLE..stay away if you are going there in the hope of a good Crepe as we did...."}
{"text":"The baked goods are fine, but not outstanding. But the prices are crazy high for the quality of food. Anyone who has been to a bakery/cafe in a larger city can get MUCH better baguettes/loaves/pastries for either the same price or cheaper.

The kicker is the customer service. The woman who manages the bakery is downright rude to customers. She rolls her eyes, sighs, and will actively complain about you to your face if you don't order the right way. 

Also, they recently took away their self-service jug-o-water. I asked the woman at the counter if I could have a glass of water with my meal and she said \"No, but I'll sell you this bottle.\"  So, this is I think *literally* the only restaurant I have ever been to that will not give you a glass of water.  Astounding."}
{"text":"Parisian Macaroon (Red) is very bitter. I don't know if it is because of the dye or the almond flour. I can't finish it ;(
The filling is great tho."}
{"text":"This place deserves every bit of 5 stars that I can give as a fellow Yelp-er because of not only its great bakeries but because of the dedication and love that its bakers put into their food! 

My boyfriend and I were passing by the Pekara bakehouse and thought that it was the actual cafe and bakery and so rang the doorbell to the place (we were slightly suspicious after this moment that maybe we were at the wrong place). A woman baker answered the door and told us that in fact, we were not at the cafe but at their warehouse where they make all of the goodies every day. Despite the fact that this was already a pretty cool discovery, she spontaneously invited the two of us in and took the time to give us a quick tour of the bakery - and even gave us a sample treat at the end (which later, we tasted and it was absolutely amazing)!

Afterwards, we of course had to go to the actual cafe and got some more treats, which didn't fail to amaze us yet again!"}
{"text":"This review is not about the baked goods. I am reviewing the \"bistro\" here. The \"bakery\" is fine.

The sandwiches here are so obscenely over-priced. I don't understand how they manage to make everything so plain and unappetizing. I ordered a \"ham and cheese melt\" that had ham and melted cheese on sourdough. The sourdough was vaguely stale and warm, but it was not clear that it had been toasted. The cheese had been melted on the bread, not the meat; there was a single, sad slice that didn't even cover all of the sourdough. The ham was overly salty, cut thick. Nothing else comes on the sandwich -- the bread isn't clearly buttered, pressed, or anything. No condiments. Just generally unappetizing. In retrospect I should have asked for a refund.

This is the most recent sandwich disappointment. I don't think I'll make the mistake of getting anything that isn't pure sugar again."}
{"text":"Their pastries are almost always stale. They have a lot of options, but not a ton of fresh options. Not the best bakery in Champaign-Urbana."}
{"text":"Pekara was built up as something really special for me long before I visited. Whenever I was in downtown Champaign during the day, I was there to study, write, grade, etc., so I was looking for coffee and space. Usually, I went with Kopi or Aroma, so it took a while for me to get in. 

I was underwhelmed. Their brewed coffee is passable. I'd go anywhere else, including Dunkin Donuts, before I'd go to Pekara for coffee. Their food can be decent, but the price point and quality never quite matched for me. I also caught a whiff of attitude once for opting for water (free) as my drink. 

Their cranberry baklava was fantastic, though."}
{"text":"I was dismayed by the poor service at the VetMed location.  After purchasing a pricey Roasted Red Pepper w/ smoked gouda soup, I was handed a cold soup and told to heat it up in the microwave.  

Unsanitary and unprofessional."}
{"text":"Great local bakery in the heart of downtown Chambana.  Awesome to drop in in the evening and get a good dessert.  Love the cheesecake baklava and I recommend their fresh ciabatta bread as well."}
{"text":"I considered having Sunday breakfast here but after reading several negative reviews re customer service, I decided to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"High quality food and super friendly staff. Great espresso in the most interesting cups ever! Perfect for lunch or bring home a euro style baguette under your arm-authentic!!"}
{"text":"I'm really a fan of Pekara's crepes and baked items in general. When you walk in, you can't help but to stare at their displays of baked items; all of which look delicious and the ones I have tried have tasted delicious so far.

During my visit I tried the La Parisienne crepes and the person I was with had the Nutella crepes with banana and walnut. I would highly recommend either of those sweet crepes if you are fiending for something savory and sweet for breakfast (or any time of the day).

Overall, it's a nice little establishment to stop in and grab a bite to eat or grab a coffee. I will definitely be returning in the future because crepes are life."}
{"text":"Tried ordering from here for the first time w/grubhub.  It was around 5:15 when I placed my order.. so I was already hungry.  Fast forward to and hour and a half later... my food never shows up.  Then had to wait on hold 15min with customer service to cancel my order.  Turns out they close at 6pm- nobody had the decency to call and say the order may not make it.  Was looking forward to trying this place out, what a shame."}
{"text":"We were travelling through and stopped by for breakfast. Organic eggs omelette drew me in. 
Big mistake!
The cashier was courteous but not the staff. The omelette was cold and unfortunately did not taste any better than the breakfast chain ones. No ketchup. No gluten free options. 
My husband had omelette with toast. They never asked what type of bread he wanted and gave raisin bread, which he did not like.
Will never go again."}
{"text":"Wow. Love the cinnamon rolls here. Microwave for fourth seconds in the back...? That seems uncouth, but whatever. Great icing. Great texture. It's a good breakfast spot. Come. Their quiche are huge, too."}
{"text":"I stopped by Pekara Bakery for dinner on Saturday, and unlike the other (fancier) downtown Champaign dining venues, it was almost empty that night. It's nothing fancy: you order from the counter and they bring the food to your table. They have a pretty wide selection of sandwiches (warm or cold), salads, pizzas and crepes. I went for the smoked salmon pizza, which came with cucumber and dill cream cheese... a somewhat unusual and unexpected combination, but it wasn't bad and it was pretty cheap ($8 or so?). I'm guessing this might be better place for lunch than it is for dinner. I'll probably give it another try sometime soon."}
{"text":"Although Pekara has delicious food, the lack of attention to getting orders correct may be dangerous for those with allergies.

Originally intending to go to Aroma for breakfast, I decided to finally check out Pekara's beautiful display of baked goods. I was elated to see that they had filled croissants like spinach and cheese, ham and cheese, and mushroom and cheese. 

I ordered the ham and cheese with a cup of cocoa - but they mistakenly gave me a mushroom and cheese croissant. I did not complain since I am an equal opportunity eater, but I know if I brought my friend here who is deathly allergic to mushrooms, well, it would have been bad.

The croissant itself was beautifully flaky and tasty - not rubbery store-bought crud. I also like how Pekara prides itself in not using preservatives!

However, the cocoa was awful - entirely made of Hershey's syrup that congealed at the bottom of the gigantic mug. At least the drink was beautiful.

I know I'll be back, but just for the food. 

Additional tip: They sell half price day old bread."}
{"text":"I am in love with the new Pekara stand at the Soulard Farmers Market. I have a horrible weakness for bread. If I try and go on a diet, bread is one thing that I cannot give up. I love it so!!  Pekara is now my go-to spot for bread at the market. The wide selection of bread and baked goods immediately catches your eye. In a glass case, there are croissants and other goodies.  Next the case is a table filled with fresh baked breads that all look mouthwatering. I have purchased the Herb Focaccia and the Baguette.  Woah, both were amazing!!! The Focaccia had the perfect amount of rosemary and salt on it and it was perfect for dipping in some olive oil with parmesan cheese.  The baguette had a rustic look to it and had the right amount of crustiness.   It went great with the Italian Wedding Soup I made for dinner that evening. The gentleman at the stand is also very nice and I will for sure be a regular customer from here on out! Thanks Pekara!!"}
{"text":"Treated extremely rudely. The food is good, but your staff needs to learn how to treat customers."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch just last week. Great ambience, great staff and amazing food. What more can you want? We ordered a savory crepe and omelette to share. Everything went swimmingly, from the fresh bread samples at the register, to the lightning fast service and readily available condiments. Best of all, Pekara is big on natural food, so you feel quite healthy after a meal here.

I really enjoy their gorgeous backyard with great outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Mmm! This place is THE place to go to, in Champaign-Urbana, for freshly-baked sweets. Albeit their cornucopia of napoleons, cinnamon rolls, fruit tarts, danishes, pies, cakes and miscellaneous sweet treats, they also have a very nice selection of sandwiches. 

They are a bit pricey, and the servers could include cutlery with the plates so you don't have to get up and get them yourself, but it's worth a visit for sure."}
{"text":"I love the bread, the crepes (especially the nutella crepe!), desserts and tea here. I can't comment on the coffee since I don't drink coffee. There is outdoor seating on the sidewalk out front as well as on the back patio. Sometimes on weekends it is so crowded that you can't find a place to sit. Once in the winter, one of the employees brought a table from outside in for me to sit at. The prices are reasonable and the quality and quantity of food is just right. I absolutely love the roasted red pepper soup, yum! The atmosphere is pleasant and sometimes they feature art pieces by local artists. There are frequent buyer cards for drinks and sandwiches. I have yet to feel disappointed at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Pekara is a wonderful place to relax and get a pastry and coffee. On nice days, the patio is delightful. Recommended items: roasted red pepper & feta croissant, spinach & feta danish, and the chocolate dome. I also buy most of my baguettes from here."}
{"text":"I recently stopped by their booth at the Soulard Market in Saint Louis and picked up some bread to take home. I usually go to the market early, take a quick lap to see who has what and then make my purchases, in and out in under an hour. This was the first time I purchased from the Pekara Bakery booth and liked their setup, friendly service and wide selection of seemingly yummy breads, pastries, donuts/Cronuts, etc A huge plus in their favor is that they sold half loafs of bread ($3.75, about 12 slices and thick) which no one else seemed to be doing. I would rather buy a couple half loafs of bread to try new floors than full loafs and be stuck with a ton of bread if I don't like it. I picked up a half loaf of their Cinnamon Raisin bread and a croissant for the road. Their pastries are large and decently priced but my overall dissatisfaction is the taste - the butter croissant, while large, was kind of bland, hard and nothing to write home about. The biggest disappointment was the bread - again, bland and very \"meh\" tasting. Very little cinnamon and honestly, I've had better tasting bread from the grocery store. I love buying local, I love tasty food and I love fresh, without the preservatives food but this experience was just a let down."}
{"text":"Just popped in for a quick coffee while my party figured out where we wanted to go for brunch.  I ordered a hot Americana and my brother got a cheese Danish.  I tried the Danish and found it nice and flakey with a good amount of cheese filling.  Americana was simply but good.  We got our drinks very quick.  Its an interesting layout with two rooms separated by a long hall way.  Seems like a decent place to do some studying and get a nice cup of coffee. If I lived in the area I could see myself frequenting Pekara.  It also has a nice outdoor patio for those wanting to enjoy the weather."}
{"text":"The desserts are always so good and pretty. The coffee is great and employees are very kind. Every time I'm in town, I always look forward to coming here. They also do latte art which is a plus!"}
{"text":"Service was laughable...simple breakfast took 30 minutes...for the first person, then another 15 minutes for the other 3.  The timing was completely off, everyone around us was ticked off.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"wow..that's all i can say...amazing omelette and croissants and the coffee and friendly service topped it to 5 stars"}
{"text":"I'd say this is the best dessert place in the town. Unlike the other American desserts which are tooooo sweet and rich, everything tastes right on the spot. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Sunday late brunch - I thought I ordered a roasted vegetable crepe but what came was a roasted vegetable omelet. Because it looked quite appetizing I decided to eat it and am glad I did. Omelets are easy yet so difficult. I don't usually order them because they often come out too soupy or dry. This one was done perfectly - slightly fluffy and moist but not runny. The roasted vegetables were quite aromatic. We also had a chocolate banana crepe which was delicate, a decent portion, and rich. Pekara also carries extravagant cakes, croissants, breads, pastries, and coffee. Relaxing neighborhood joint with high quality food. 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Pekara's got a hippie sort of charm that I'm down for, and some DELICIOUS sandwiches.  Yes, the caps are necessary.  The best part?  They serve coffee in a series of mismatched store-owned mugs.  That makes me very happy, and it's far less wasteful than say a Starbucks which would just make a thousand disposable goods.

I did get elbowed aside by a pushy older Caucasian gentleman who then glared at me for half of my coffee experience, but his class privilege is not the fault of Pekara (or is it....!?), so no stars lost there.

I like you Pekara, and I see you and I having a delicious sandwichy future."}
{"text":"I've lived in Champaign for 8 years, and I *want* to love Pekara and support local business. Even though many of their menu items are great, their customer service is atrocious. Specifically who I think is one of their managers, Alli, but also many of their behind-counter staff. Whether it is stopping in to ask about their featured pastry, or calling in a catering order, I have experienced nothing but rudeness and argumentative aggression from Pekara staff for years, with two recent experiences putting the final nails in the coffin.

A few months ago I stood at the counter while 2 people cleaned behind it, even though it was still 30 minutes before closing and they had customers at tables. After being ignored for a solid 2 minutes, I said, \"excuse me, can I please make an order?\" One woman didn't even look up from her tasks, and the other one said, \"Yeah\" flatly. I asked about one of the desserts and she gave me a one-word answer. I wanted to take my business elsewhere, but I was supposed to pick up sweets for a party and figured I'd just deal with it this time. The woman flopped my delicate pastries in a box, flopped the box on the counter, rung me up without a word, and didn't respond when I said \"Thank You.\" I opened the box as I left and saw my pastries were smeared along the box due to carelessly flinging them in there. I didn't want to deal with the staff again, so I shared the story at the party and two people said they have had similar rude experiences at Pekara.

Flash forward to last week when I called to make a catering order, and manager Alli not only was rude to me on the phone, but continued to be rude even after I stated that I've had poor service before and would like to not be treated rudely for no reason. She continued to argue with me about a catering order I made a year ago, which I remember clearly and she was no part of. (She didn't take nor deliver my order a year ago, yet she kept telling me I was wrong about my memory of the order). If I didn't have to make the order for work, I would have hung up right then. Pekara is one of those places that is cute and has good product, but the EXPERIENCE of going there is what makes me want to run for the hills. When I complained about this experience to my fiance, he said he's long stopped going there for the same reason. I've given Pekara my money and forgiveness for far too long -- I am now actively NOT a customer and will never recommend them to friends or colleagues again."}
{"text":"This place is fine, and their pastries look amazing, but when purchased (for a pretty penny) they are nothing to write home about at all. I didn't enjoy their sandwiches either - actually I felt a little sick. My husband liked it ok, so I gave it 3 stars, but for my own purpose, I would only go there to hang out, work on my laptop, and eat something small just to keep my energy up."}
{"text":"Their Cuban sandwich on fresh baked bread is seriously delicious, and not what you're going to get elsewhere. Love the baked croissants they keep in the display case--good if you're trying to keep the budget on track.

Coffee is decent, but I wouldn't go for just coffee."}
{"text":"Uhh Huh...pastry and my sixteen year old loves their Cuban"}
{"text":"Just had a fantastic Cuban sandwich for breakfast medium roast coffee delightful. And of course a bunch of cookies to go that melt in your mouth we will be back next week"}
{"text":"Pekara has decent coffee and reasonably fast wifi.  The crepes are tasty but inconstant.  Depending which chef makes the crepes, they can range from soggy to burnt.  Still, Pekara can be a nice retreat from the crowded, noisy campus."}
{"text":"Orderd a machiatto and then gave me some caramel drink. That's not a real macchiato. Asked for a real machiatto and they treated me like I was stupid. Still have not received my refund. Short rotund manager apparently doesn't give a shitte about ratings."}
{"text":"Ok, so A bunch of us went down to U of I for the weekend and someone we know said we should try this place. It looks nice and their pastries are delicious...BUT...their crepes..are meh...

I ordered the strawberry and cream crepes and I didn't like them much. Their crepes had too much cream and the cream was very strong, over powering the crepes. Strawberries weren't ripe, so a little sour in taste and the crepe was just ok. Overall, the taste wasn't pleasing and I will only be coming here if I have to, or for their bakery items."}
{"text":"Love it!! One of my favorite places to go!"}
{"text":"Great quick lunch spot downtown.  Roasted Red Pepper Gouda soup is  wonderful and I usually get the salad of the day.  One thing I wish they did was post their daily specials online on Facebook or Twitter so I knew when my favorite salad or sandwich was on the menu.  That would cause me to go a lot more.  Downtown Champaign has very few quick lunch options, and I would consider this the best."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their food, especially the breakfast sandwiches and sandwiches. The bread and bagels are always very fresh and a generous portion. 

The coffee is also quite good. The atmosphere is nice, there's plenty of space to sit and enjoy your food. 

My issue is that the customer service, like other reviews stated, is bad. Under the description for the breakfast sandwich ingredients, egg is not included. So I asked the simple question \"can I have egg on my breakfast sandwich?\" And her response was very sarcastic and condescending and she seemed to be laughing at me, which I did not appreciate as a polite and paying customer. However I just shook it off and enjoyed my good food! 

Come here for the good food and expect mediocre service and you will enjoy yourself!"}
{"text":"A nice place to get lunch or some sweet baked goods. Sandwiches are on nice fresh-baked bread and you can get them toasted or cold. Each comes with a side or grapes and chips. There are also some sweet and savory crepes. Baked goods range from chocolate cake to cute pink cookies. It's right next to Aroma, so if you hungry from studying you can migrate here. Outdoor patio has a perfect view of one of downtown's nicest art deco buildings.

Only caveat is the prosciutto crepes...I don't know what type they are using, but it is not the appetizing Italian variety. In fact, it was so unappetizing, that I have downgraded my review. I love their other items, but that experience has made this place less desirable."}
{"text":"Very accommodating and good tasting eggs.  I stayed at the Hilton during homecoming week and I'm gluten & dairy free.  All I wanted was some poached or scrambled eggs that didn't have dairy in them.  This was very hard to find at 7 am on a Saturday.  This place made a special order for me and they were delicious, served with some spinach and organic eggs.  The people were very nice, high quality food, fast service and reasonably priced.  If I'm in town again I would go there in a moment."}
{"text":"Cute little place downtown Champaign! Pekara has a variety of great pastries that cannot be found anywhere else in champaign! They also have great bread, I like the focaccia. Their opera cake, macarons, sugar cookies, cherry danishes, and raspberry dark chocolate tart are all great as well! I also really like the chicken pesto sandwich, kale salad, and quiche. They have great lunch deals too...and wifi! One of my favorite places in Champaign :)"}
{"text":"Chocolate mousse torte was passable, but nothing spectacular. A torte should be small and rich, but the mousse was not terribly rich and the underlying cake was on the dry side. Lacking in velvety chocolate richness.

The apricot shortbread was also passable, but soggy and lacked dimension. No undertone of saltiness, butter flavor was not apparent through the flavor of the apricot jam, and I like a little more wheat flavor.

I'd suggest increasing the proportion of butter to flour, including a small amount of whole wheat or graham flour, and upping the salt on the shortbread -- but what do I know?"}
{"text":"I stop by when I am in town. Haven't eaten lunch, usually tasting some baked goods. They have a great selection and always good. Stopped by on a Friday afternoon and both staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"Purchased a 1/2 sheet chocolate/yellow cake with raspberry filling for a special family event.  The cake was nicely decorated, however, the end pieces were dry. Also there was very little raspberry filling.  Too $$$$ for the cake quality."}
{"text":"So glad they now have a stand at Soulard Farmers' Market in St. Louis. Just had their whole wheat bread for the first time, a real artisan treat - with great crust, crumb and flavor. Look forward to trying other types."}
{"text":"I needed a baguette to go along with a stew I had made, and this place held one for me until I could come to get it later that day. I appreciated that to the highest."}
{"text":"Love me some of those roasted veggie and chicken pesto crepes... :) I, also, can't forget those delicious blueberry scones....YUM!"}
{"text":"Ever since I moved here, I've struggled to locate bagels as good as I found in New York. After a long series of mediocre bagels, I can finally say that I have my bagel supplier, Pekara."}
{"text":"Pekara has a lot going for it. The staff are really friendly and they have a really focused lunch menu. My favorite soups are the tomato and red pepper bisques, and they've gone out of their way to heat some up even if it's not on the day's menu which is really going the extra mile. I've had their turkey, blt and mushroom sandwiches and all were very tasty. Their breads are really great, too and you can't beat the price for a half soup and half sandwich at lunch. The best thing are the portion sizes! When Penara or Atlanta Bread Co. give you a half sandwich it's more like a 1/4 sandwich. There are times at Pekara i can't imagine how large a full sandwich would be! I haven't tried much of their baked goods but they look amazing."}
{"text":"The food here is overpriced and not that tasty. That said, their pastries are great and their bread is reasonably priced and delicious. Not the English bread but pain de campagne and ciabatta. Otherwise, do not bother with the food or coffee. Aroma does better in both regards."}
{"text":"3.5 stars is really more realistic.....

My husband and I showed up to meet a friend for breakfast. We were there a little early and said emphatically that we wanted coffee and it was our first time there, and were met with silence and attitude. We finally decided on a lemon/cheese danish and a berries and cream cheese crepe. The girl working there apparently confused \"lemon and cheese danish\" for pumpkin and cream cheese muffin, which she stated they did not have. So I repeated the order, and she got to work. It didn't take too long to get the crepe (less than 5 min), but when my friend ordered, I went up to the counter with her and the girl asked me \"if she could help me\" to which I replied no, I was getting water and talking to my friend. That girl had a serious problem with apathy and attitude. Later, she climbed up into the visible \"attic\" storage and THREW things down (like paper towels, boxes, etc.)

The prices could be better, but it was around $12 for a crepe, a pastry, and two cups of coffee. 

The crepe was really tasty and the coffee was good too, but the pastry was nothing special, I've had better at Panera."}
{"text":"Front service guy was kind of rude. I came in around 4pm, almost no one there. Came in to buy a small  treat for a friends birthday, and while I was browsing their selection he kept eyeing me and I felt extremely rushed and unwelcomed. When i asked for prices, he would only give individual item prices. I had to keep asking for prices of everything else which was a pain.

In the end, I got a flower decorated sugar cookie. Nothing too special. Wouldn't come back.
Only pro was \"free cookie Monday.\""}
{"text":"Pekara is my favorite bakery in Champaign-Urbana. I believe they have the best desserts available in this area. However, their savory, non-dessert items are some of the worst food I've ever had not just in CU but anywhere. For example, their quiches are otherworldly... And not in a good way. Something about their specific flavor profile of olives and eggs and spinach and mushy crusts reflected poor thought in product development. Their crepes are tasteless and sad. On top of that, I think the food is laughably overpriced for its taste and quality (desserts here are worth the price though). As an amateur baker and lover of baked goods, I think there is no competition when it comes to their confections.

Also, 1000% agree with the other reviewers: most of the staff are very rude and, well, lazy and cannot be bothered to walk more than a few steps to help you with questions or anything else. They act like being there is sucking their souls out, which might be true, but probably best not to make it too obvious."}
{"text":"I do love their desserts and go often to pick up cakes or baked goods. Their food is overpriced for what they are, but good. So I have been a regular at Pekara. The reason I am not giving it five stars is their customer service has taken a nosedive over the years and the people who attended me this morning were downright rude. Very condescending replies to a normal question. I am not sure what is going on with the management because it was not like this two years ago. I think I will avoid Pekara until they improve their tone. I walked out of there today and parked myself at their neighboring cafe, where I felt quite welcome."}
{"text":"I was downtown with time to kill and thought I'd go get a cup of coffee. I knew of the Aroma Cafe and walked there. Then I noticed Pekara and thought I'd give it a try.  I ordered:
1. CUBAN - ham, Cuban pork, provolone, pickle 
& Dijon mustard on Focaccia $7.7   
and a \"Turkish Coffee\". The sandwich was delicious and served with Kettle Sea Salt chips.  I had never tried a Turkish Coffee and the lady said it was a really strong coffee. It was good, but too strong for my taste. I enjoyed the atmosphere and style of the establishment and will definitely return to try other things on their delicious looking menus."}
{"text":"Good quality food fairly priced. What more could you ask. Great place to stop in and have a bite. Their bread is excellent."}
{"text":"In all of the lists of must-visit spots in Chambana that I've found Pekara always makes an appearance and for good reason. Upon entering, I was greeted by the friendly cashier. When I asked for her recommendations she gladly offered a variety of her favorite treats and then gave me adequate time to decide what I'd like to try for myself.
After much deliberation, I went with the scotch oatmeal cookie that the lovely cashier recommended along with an iced coffee. Just a heads up for anyone interested, their oatmeal cookies are the real deal, made with shortening and lots of love. So while the cookie was the perfect balance of \"crunchy AND chewy\" that the cashier promised it would be, this treat definitely serves as a more once in a while splurge in my book. There were a number of other delicious looking pastries, tiramisu, and cakes on display; it really was tough to choose!
My total came to $3.25 which I thought was extremely affordable considering the use of local ingredients and the fact that, at some other coffee shops in town, you'd pay that much alone for a cookie or a coffee separately.
I thoroughly enjoyed my cookie, but I also just really enjoyed the space. The noise level was prime for sitting down and getting some studying and busywork done on a lazy Friday late afternoon.
The combination of friendly and accommodating staff, delicious products, and the cool bakery/coffee shop ambiance give Pekara a thumbs up in my book. I definitely hope to be back in the next week or two!"}
{"text":"Decent stop for an omelette or breakfast sandwich but nothing special or unique. They had good coffee and the baked goods looked sumptuous. They have Quick service and a low overhead-you clean up your own dishes. The place could use a good cleaning from the light fixtures to the bathrooms."}
{"text":"The turkey melt here is amazing! A perfect portion of soft, warm sourdough bread with turkey, cheddar, and bacon. With a pickle on the side and a bag of chips it's a great lunch. I'm also a huge fan of the black currant iced tea. I've sampled a couple of the bakery items and they're always good and I love that they have smaller cookies for $.75 so you can still satisfy your sweet tooth without having to gorge on calories.

Some negatives - inside seating is limited so it may be hard to get a table during lunch. Also, the line can move a little slowly, but the staff is pleasant."}
{"text":"There isn't a 2.5 star rating so I notched it up to 3 because when Pekara is good, it's good. But when it's bad, it's terrible.

I've had a multitude of mixed experiences here, both in service and food quality. When the baked goods are fresh, some of them can be outstanding. But when they've dried and/or gone stale and they're still selling them, it's like throwing money in the trash. (And sometimes when you ask what's fresh and you get it, it's still sub par.) The bread leaves something to be desired--I do not go here for their bread items.

Pekara is not an inexpensive place to eat, either. Sometimes the service is fast and friendly and other times it's indifferent and slow. While most local businesses have a policy for a minimum spending amount to use a debit/credit card, most shop owners will still let you use your card if you're out of cash and making a purchase. Not here. I was thirty cents below the minimum and had no other means of paying for my purchase and I did not want to add on another $3 item, so the cashier took my item back and I walked out the door. It just baffles me that they'd rather lose a sale/customer than let you use your card for a $2.20 purchase.

In sum: hit or miss. Could be top notch with a few changes, in this reviewer's opinion."}
{"text":"Pekara is a bakery in Champaign with an inviting storefront. When I got there, I ordered a Ham and cheese croissant, which was good and cheap. However after that, it began to get expensive. I originally came here for a crepe, and I must say that I think their savory crepes are better than their sweet ones.

The Salmon crepe that my friend ordered was good, however, the chocolate banana crepe I ordered was horrible! It was tough to cut through, there wad hardly any nutella or chocolate on it, and it tasted flavorless. I was disappointed.

I ordered a fruit tart, which was good (you can't go wrong with those), but pricey. And their French sodas are okay, but also pricey.

Since the main reason I came was for the crepe and the crepe I had was terrible, I can't give this rating no more than three stars."}
{"text":"Pekara Bakery is one of my absolute favorites in Champaign! They have *the best* tiramisu and crepes in the C-U area, and their crepes are to die for. In addition to their many bakery items, they have a great assortment of coffee drinks, sandwiches, salads, and more! It is the perfect place to go for breakfast, brunch or to get dessert. Always such a treat!

I will add that this is not an ideal place for large groups or meetings. They have a back room, but seating is kind of tight and the sound carries and can be very loud. It is *perfect* for small meetings, however. I really enjoy holding one-on-one meetings there, or meeting with a small handful of friends. In the summer, their outdoor seating is great too!

The only reason my review is 3-stars and not 5-stars is because the staff members are not the friendliest. I have had multiple encounters with different cashiers and their attitude is the same across the board. I have also had two incidents where they forgot about my order and I had to wait over 45 minutes to get it. My fiance won't come with me to Pekara because he feels the staff are so rude to us. I usually get our orders to go."}
{"text":"Great service! A little hesitant to the cheese the use, so if you're picky about your cheese, ask! Love the coffee barista, does an amazing job!"}
{"text":"The pastries are beautifully presented & impressive. I like the Swedish oatmeal cookies (yay! no raisins!) and macaroons. Then there's the baklava and the pretty cakes... Besides amazing pastries, they have delicious sandwiches. The Cuban and Hot Chicken sandwiches are my favourites. Omelettes & crêpes are meh. There's a decent selection of fresh bread too. I like the jalapeño cheese pretzels & ciabatta when they're available. The baguettes have been hard & stale on occasion. I like to go in for an espresso & a sandwich before I work night shift. I get a pastry to go or pick up one in the morning when I get off work. For ambiance, there's a rotation selection of artwork. It's often loud inside & not conducive of conversation. The baristas are sometimes attentive & sometimes they just ignore me until I flag them down. All in all, I like their pastries & some of the sandwiches, but it's not my favourite place to hang. This place is kinda hit or miss."}
{"text":"The bakery is great: croissants, baguettes, focaccia are among the best in the area. However, their espressos are undrinkable: bitter and bad quality coffee beans. Avoid at all costs. I will upgrade to 5 stars if they will get their coffee act together."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what has happened to this place. Or actually, maybe I am. I can't say for sure, but I believe ownership changed several months back, and if so, it's obvious that the new owners are merely profit driven and not overly concerned with customer experience. I've stopped going entirely, as the prices are exorbitant for what you get and the service is often actively aggressive. There's nothing at all special about this place, and you can get relatively healthy/artisanal breakfast elsewhere and skip the snark often present at the Pekara counter."}
{"text":"Love their old world sourdough bread, but the real standout here is their almond croissant! Flaky pastry filled with almond paste that is neither too sweet nor too well done- this joint h as it down! Pekara also manages to deliver on breakfast, contrary to some other reviewers experiences, I was pleased with my roasted vegetable omelette...Prices here are reasonable- considering the quality of the ingredients."}
{"text":"I used Pekara Bakery as the source for my wedding cake, and I couldn't be happier. Samantha was excellent to work with, and gave suggestions and guidance about making a cake that suited us. The cake was very good and looked lovely. The pricing was on par with the area at $3.50 a slice (as of August 2013). My husband and I tried three other bakeries in town before we found Pekara, and this one stood out as the best in our opinions."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and fine coffee, but food was cold and under seasoned. Cost was too high for the product and overall experience."}
{"text":"I've had the tiramisu here before and it was fab.  But the last time I went, it was disgusting.  The texture was gloppy and gelatinous.  It reminded me of very nasty bodily excretions.

Freakin' yuck."}
{"text":"Really cute place to stop for lunch on a snowy day! I recommend the Caesar salad! I got it with the roasted red pepper and Gouda soup. The desserts taste as amazing as they look. And the lattes are Great too!! Bread is half price on Sundays by the way!"}
{"text":"I'll start off on a bright note: the drip coffee is tasty. 

But terrible croissants! Mine tasted like it was made days ago, hard chocolate pellets and all. If you want a good croissant, go to Mirabelle's. 

The breakfast sandwich was also bad, no flavor except for the delicious sourdough bagel.
Also this place is pretty dusty and dirty. 
Step it up, Pekara."}
{"text":"I came here with my mom about two weeks ago and I really enjoyed my quiche, tirumasu, and mango soda that I ordered! SO GOOD! But my mom did not like her decaf coffee that she ordered. She enjoyed her lemon bar though!"}
{"text":"I used to like this place, but after the customer service experience and bad food, can't give it another chance.

For one, brought my mom in and we hyped up your place because we had 2 good times before that. This wasn't one of those times. We came on a Monday or Sunday, not sure, but anyways, our food comes out. My girlfriends sandwich came on rock solid bread. And I really wish I was exaggerating when I say rock solid, but I wasn't. And then my mom orders the vegetarian sandwich, forgot what it's called, and there is a scoop of the mix in the middle of the sandwich. If you tried to spread it out, it would probably be as thin as a sheet of paper (once again, I'm not exaggerating at all). Therefore, both my mom and girlfriend complained at separate times. When my girlfriend complained, the cashier said \"oh that's how that bread is, all the time, I told you this before you ordered\" (he didnt) Which of course was a lie, because not only have we had that bread fresh, but no one without razor sharp teeth could chew that. Then my mom complains, and she talks to the cook, and the cook says \"well I don't know what you want me to do about it, you already started eating it\" which she replies politely by just asking for a different sandwich.

With all this, my sandwich wasn't even good since the bread was also old and hard, but I wasn't going to complain because it wasn't going to get anywhere. Anyways, if your a BAKE GOODs store, don't sell bread on your off day and just try to pass off staleness and then complain back to the customer. It was a very good time to witness how bad customer service can be. We didn't mess the food up, don't get mad at us.

I also messaged the Facebook page and tried to explain what happened, because I don't often go right to Yelp when a restaurant has a bad day. I understand because I am also a cook. Even after them appreciating us talking to them, and then offering a free lunch, whenever we try to redeem that lunch, they ignore us. So I came here. 

Hey Pekera, teach your employee's how to respect the people that come into the store, considering we're the reason you exist, don't give us attitude over and over because you guys don't know how to store bread.....at a bakery.....that sells sandwiches...."}
{"text":"I think that Pekara gets a bad rap from when the place first started. Sure I went there a few times when I was exploring downtown, and I just thought the place was alright, the staff a little iffy. Now, it's such a great, cute little cafe. I absolutely adore the place! I love the crepes which taste just like the ones I had in Europe. And oh! the chocolate raspberry mousse cake is amazing! I'm also so very obsessed with their snow cookies... it's ridiculous. If I didn't live in Urbana, I think I would end up a diabetic. Hands down the best bakery in the CU area."}
{"text":"My daughter and I decided to try Pekara while she was on her summer break.  We had never been here before and it was apparent; however not to the lady behind the counter.  I'm not sure if she rubbed me the wrong way or if I rubbed her the wrong way, but my daughter chose the chocolate croissant and I the fruit tart.   When trying to make a drink selection and explaining to the woman that we had never been here before she directed me to the drink menu after looking around.  Now that she knows this, she fails to direct us to tableware, etc.  just felt very unwelcome here, but still excited to try the wonderful pastries.  

First off, my fruit tart was placed on a Chipped plate (tacky).  The tart was excellent and fresh!  The chocolate croissant was Mainly croissant.  Hardly any chocolate.  Art Mart has way-better chocolate croissants, by the way.  My daughters frozen hot chocolate was very good and my chai latte was yummy as well. Despite some of the negatives, the fruit tart will bring me back.  I'm interested to try the lunch items as well as dessert."}
{"text":"I discovered Pekara this summer and I like it!! Friendly place where you can meet up with friends and have a nice meal!! Deserts are fantastic!"}
{"text":"While the food and pastries are pretty good, the customer service needs a lot of work!  

My friends and I walked in on a weekend looking to try their pastries and lunch specials. When I got up to the counter, I immediately note the unwelcoming look on the cashier's face. This was my first time here, so I asked a question to clarify the lunch special and the woman just looked at me and says \"ok so what do you want.\" She completely ignored my question so I just decide to order. I then ask what the soups are, since this is my first time here and I am unfamiliar with the place and the menu. She looks upset that she has to point over to a separate menu hanging on a different wall. 

I am polite the entire time and just try to go with the flow. The food was good - nothing amazing. But the customer service is enough to make you question coming back. 

Ironic because they have a \"hate has no place here\" sign hanging outside their window."}
{"text":"First time and so much to choose from!  Maple bacon croi-nut was so good!  Dark roast coffee was perfect!  Friendly helpful staff."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get lunch in Downtown Champaign.  They have so many options, I try something new every time I go and have not been disappointed. I love their baked goods, especially the Maple Bacon Croi'nuts.  Today I had a veggie quiche and it was so good, the texture was silky like cheesecake- I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"It is one of my favorite cafes in town. Awesome food and nice place to spend your time at."}
{"text":"Pekara has recently become my go-to spot if I want to spend a few hours sitting downtown. The coffee is good, the service is friendly, and there's a great selection of food whether you are looking for a snack, a meal, or something sweet.

The crepes and the omelets here are outstanding! Especially the vegetarian options. And all the pastries and baked-good I've had are delicious.

There are a few tables out front and a patio in the back if you want to sit outside. In the back, they have a couch and an armchair and a taller table that works well for small groups.

The only weird thing is that they don't bring cutlery out when you order the food so unless you think ahead, you have to walk back over to the counter. Not a big deal, but it would be a nice thing for them to do."}
{"text":"i've been here twice.  this place is confused.  my 12 year old son was totally unimpressed after they completely screwed up what he ordered.  the staff are maybe too focused on the whole hippie schtick to realize that paying customers don't really care about the staff's identities and really just expect to get what they pay for.
if you need a coffee and/or food, walk around the corner to kopi."}
{"text":"Pekara is a really cute place. I've had their breakfast omelettes which are a much healthier and lighter version that the stuffed huge ones you get at most breakfast places, and their coffee is really good as well as their tea. Also love that they have soy milk because I'm lactose. There's one worker there that always sings Beyonce and is fabulous, and I love him. He's such a mood-lifter. 

Their desserts are REALLY good. The lemon cheesecake and fruit tart are my favorite. Their quiches are also quite good. My only complaint is if you come towards the evening some of their pastries can be dry/crumbly. Their tiramisu lady fingers get dry pretty fast. They do make everything fresh morning of though, so it makes sense. Their bread is BOMB by the way."}
{"text":"I have only purchased cakes and desserts from this place for quite a number of times so my review is based on their desserts. When they are fresh, they are really good, particularly the flourless chocolate cake or brownie. The quality is inconsistent because some of the cakes they sell aren't fresh - you know they are days old when the texture is dry and the icing falls off the cake in clumps. I would be trying out their sandwiches in the future. Perhaps this might give them a more favorable rating. There's quite a variety of cakes and desserts in this bakery though - they sell everything from macaroons, cookies, baklavas, to cakes. I sure wish that the quality was more consistent with baked goods."}
{"text":"Finding a coffee house in downtown Champaign is no longer a chore. There are plenty of outlets to fill your desire for high quality java so the hardest part is deciding which to choose. My favorite place is Pekara. It has your expected selections of coffee, espresso, tea, and the like. I think their strongest feature though is their selection of sandwiches, breads, and desserts which I think are the best of any place around. There's also plenty of space to sit although the arrangement of the kitchen is a little weird and creates this narrow hallway effect that connects the front of house with the back seating area. It is conveniently located to City Hall and other major businesses. Recommended."}
{"text":"First, the things Pekara does well. I frequently encounter quiche with an unappetizing dense, crumbling texture, so I was absolutely over the moon when I discovered Pekara's quiche lorraine--instead of a piece of dried-out egg cake, the filling is so superbly soft and velvety that it literally melts in your mouth. At the Urbana farmers' market, I'll stop by their stall and pick up a filled croissant, which are always crisp and flaky beyond belief (not the sad, soggy pastries that croissants can sometimes be). I also crave their savory roasted red pepper and Gouda soup--but I bet they buy it packaged from some wholesaler as I've eaten nearly identical versions at several other places in town.

Next, the things I'm not so happy with. One morning I decided to stop in and pick up some treats for my workplace's coffee hour. Thinking it'd probably be a good bulk investment, I opted for a loaf of the pumpkin bread, which came out to more than $10. I've been able to pick up a loaf at other bakeries in town for around $5, so I was admittedly shocked, especially because the bread was very dry and not particularly special in any way. 

Some of their baked goods are fairly inconsistent in quality--so much that I've sometimes wondered if they switched owners/bakers. Recently, they've made attempts to introduce some of the classic items you'd see in a New York Italian bakery, but unfortunately their attempts lack heart. It's as if some of the cookies weren't properly taste-tested before making it to the shelves.

For Pekara, I'd recommend the savory items (omelettes, sandwiches, salads, quiches) over the sweets."}
{"text":"This review is based not on a dining experience, but as a coffeeshop experience.

I've been to Pekara several times in an attempt to have coffee and  work. I keep trying because I like the atmosphere more than Aroma or Kopi.  But, the wireless is always spotty. Most recently, last Friday night, the wifi wasn't working at all. We talked to a staff member, and she tried to reset it, but it never ended up working, and we ended up leaving.  The frustrating part is that we had made several purchases, were clearly there to work, and there was no indication prior to ordering that the wifi was having any problems.  I think that in these cases, if wifi is faulty, customers should be given notification before they settle in. This has happened at least twice now.

I ordered a pumpkin latte, which was tasty.  The sugar cookie tasted too much like almond extract for my preferences.  I prefer purer tasting sugar cookies.

I might return to Pekara in the future for bread or to have a drink when I don't need the Internet to work."}
{"text":"i'm convinced i ordered the wrong thing. bakeries and locally grown produce supporters will always have a place in my heart, but pekara definitely let me down. i made a last minute switch from the mushroom & swiss croissant to the hummus vegetarian sandwich. (if i was a time traveler, i would go back and order the croissant) i got it to go and was incredibly unpleased when i saw a bag of lay's in my take out box... definitely one of my biggest pet peeves. don't cop out and throw a bag of the least popular chips in the world in there. it's like a slap in the face. anywho, the sandwich itself was nothing memorable, and definitely not worth $8. great bread, 2 slices of tomato, maybe 5 super thin slices of cucumber, a leaf of lettuce, and spread of hummus. that's it? that's all you got, pekara? like i said, complete disappointment.

3 stars for the yummy bread, beautiful display of baked goods (that i stupidly ignored), and the biased potential I believe this place has. haha. but negative stars for the bag of lay's, the server who refused to step in while I went back and forth between menu items, and weak hummus sammie. 

like i said, soft spot for places like these, i'll be back and im hoping pekara wont go down without a fight."}
{"text":"Go to Pekara for their coffee or pastries (OMG THEIR PASTRIES). You can also go for their amazing sandwiches (Banh Mi is AMAZING)! But I want you to go for their customer service. Everyone is treated like a family friend (which can mean a little sass) and that is what I am looking for. Whenever I travel, I want to feel like I could live there: Denver, Atlanta, or small-town Oklahoma. Pekara does this for me. Everyone makes it feel like I have always been there. Gets me right in the feels!"}
{"text":"I won't give my business here again. These people truly come across as mean. Not only to us, but I watched the woman behind the counter interact with a few other guests as well, and the whole thing left a sour taste in my mouth.

We go in to \"treat ourselves\" to a non-fast food late breakfast; it's a beautiful day. I get up to the counter to order a breakfast sandwich, but as mentioned in another review, I also inquired about the automatic inclusion of egg. Pro tip: put that on the menu if you plan to stay in business longer and get annoyed when the customer asks you questions. Whatever, I order my sandwich. I didn't want a drink, but I asked if they had potatoes. This woman leaned forward, looked at me like I was insane, and pointed to the right at the rack of potato chips. I was taken aback mentally and almost physically by this woman getting in my face, and I clarified, \"no, breakfast potatoes of any sort.\" She said no, I paid, found a place to sit outside, and the food was actually okay.

The food itself was better than a 1/5, but I will never be back here. Customer service is big for me, and I won't even tell you about what happened when we tried to get a small to-go box."}
{"text":"Went here once for lunch with co-workers.  Seemed to be like just a little sandwich/soup/salad plus bakery type of place.  The food was average at best.  Unfortunately, the reason for the low review was the price.  I paid something like $8 for a sandwich on two of the smallest slices of sourdough bread I've ever seen and a handful of chips.  I felt ridiculously ripped off, and was left feeling hungry.  Actually, quite a few of my co-workers with more money in their pockets ended up buying seconds just to fill their appetites.  

It took a little while for the food to come out as well.  The sandwich wasn't bad, just very average and ridiculously overpriced.  Soup and salad were the same.   I'll be staying away."}
{"text":"Can I give 0 star? Never ever coming back... So disappointed... :(

Second time here. Ordered two cakes for to-go. I didn't open the box at the counter, which is something I should have done. When I got home and open it with so much excitement, BOTH were WRONG! 

Didn't feel attended at all by any of their staff when buying. I took desserts back in 100 degrees weather for full refund. Completely lost my appetite. :( When I said I was going to talk about this experience on Yelp, the cashier doesn't seem to care at all. 

Last time I bought a Triple Chocolate Ganache Cake for my friend's birthday who is a chocolate lover. Still remember how saccharine it was... a nightmare. We ended up throwing more than half of it away. 

I'm sorry for this bakery. Will never come back to such a place where customers and their experience are blatantly ignored. 

I barely never gave out negative reviews on Yelp but this time I am extremely outraged by their service. Would NOT recommend this place unless you want your day ruined as mine.

Having been to 25 states and 5 countries, this one place unites THE worst dessert and service I ever had."}
{"text":"The food here isn't bad but it isn't anything to write home about and the servings are small and prices large. I spent $7.50 for a small lukewarm portebella sandwich and my husband got a very small and flavorless omelet with lukewarm bread that was supposed to be toast for $5.50. There are definitely better deals to be had in town. Their bread and pastries are better than their meals but still overpriced."}
{"text":"This is the place in Downtown Champaign that you go for the best pastries. They have a daily array of yum yums that may include some of these: bagels, danish, bear claws, turnovers, cheesecake, cookies baklava(excellent), tarts, tortes, fruit/nut bars, quiche, rolls, and much more. Every one of these that I have tried has been very good.

They also have really good daily soups (with surprisingly high prices) and good lunches. Their lunches are pretty expensive for what you get, but all sandwiches come on their awesome bread. They make crepes here that are pretty good, but again, the prices are pretty high for what you get. It can get crowded at lunch time, also. They have staff to deliver the meals to your tables after you order at the counter.

Coffee comes in little (one size) cups and is often weak. Get your coffee next door at Aroma, people bring product from one cafe to the other all the time.

It may seem like I am way too down on this place for a 4 star review, but for what I am looking for (pastries!) they are solid."}
{"text":"This place has great pastry items, their carrot cake and tiramisu are amazing. The quiche are just right(all organic eggs), the breakfast bagel with eggs and cheese is very yummy as well as the the Cuban sandwich!!! It does get a little crowded 12-1 lunch time and on weekends during brunch hours. Their prices are so cheap compared to big cities, for the quality foods you are getting :)"}
{"text":"Yummy croissants and breads, and kind servers...nice atmosphere all-around.  Chicken tortilla soup packs a little punch, so if you are sensitive to spice, be aware!"}
{"text":"You want to get their crepes because they add value to your digestive system. I had a sandwich and it was alright."}
{"text":"A dear bakery & cafe in the nice part of Champaign. Enjoyed a breakfast here and was pleasantly surprised with the quality and prices. The interior is clean and there is decent amount of space without some outdoor seating. Cashiers were nice and friendly.

We enjoyed two crepes, a quiche, and a soup for breakfast. I really liked the quiche here. It's more eggy like an omelet but it was very aromatic with the bacon on the bottom. I think I ordered the Florentine quiche? The crepes are nice as well. It's not a very thin, delicate crepe, but I really liked the sweet cream inside along with the fruit. Its stuffed with the cream and what's nice is that it wasn't too sweet and it had a hint of acidity. I would skip the tomato soup with gouda here. It was too heavy in my taste - almost like a sauce. It does come with a lot of bread though.

With it's price point, I'd definitely want to come back when I have the chance!"}
{"text":"This place has delicious lunch and baked goods. 

I love their tuna salad sandwich - the tuna salad is AMAZINGLY GOOD! It has bits of white cheese (I'm still trying to figure out what kind, but it's sooo tasty!) and berries in it that set it apart from other tuna salads. Paired with a fluffy, buttery croissant, the combination of flavors is wonderful!

I have also had the red pepper and smoked gouda bisque, which has been on their specials board for a couple of weeks. So good! And it comes with a generous helping of fresh bakery bread.

The only thing I didn't entirely enjoy was a mango smoothie.  This is mainly because it was quite pricey for the quality IMO, since it was made with pre-squeezed mango and other juices from a container, versus using real, fresh fruit."}
{"text":"Had a tuna sandwich, which was OK, and a cup of flat coffee that I didn't finish.  This was $9.50... a bit steep. 

The layout is awful... the kitchen bisects the seating area, and all of the kitchen noise is audible (read: deafening) in the seating areas.  

I asked for milk in coffee and was told the half and half was behind me.  Half and Half is the farthest thing from milk in the universe. 

Won't be back."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place for the following reasons: a) inexpensive, quality coffee, easily the best value in the Chambana area, b) deliiiiccciiiouuus pastries!!!!  Think fruit tarts, chocolate raspberry cake...yum yum, c) decent, wide selection of foods; besides the usual soup, sandwich, salad coffee shop fare, they also have some serviceable crepes, and d) lots of seating, with smaller 2 person tables for studiers/couples, and larger tables in the back for groups/families (plus a nice outdoor seating area in the back).  Oh, and free wifi as well!
One star off for their relatively limited hours...only open till 9 M-Sat, and till 5 (ouch!) on Sundays."}
{"text":"Some of the best cinnamon rolls I've ever had! I was in town for my niece's graduation and Pekara became a daily fixture for me. On my last day I also tried the breakfast sandwich on a sourdough bagel. The bagel was toasted to perfection and delicious but the sandwich could have used an extra couple slices of bacon. I bought a loaf of bread to take home...thankfully, they have instructions on how to keep your bread fresh for the longest period of time, as their breads do not have preservatives. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little bakery and bistro with very pleasant humans who serve you. I'm a huge fan of the quiche and honestly, I dig the overall vibe of this sweet little spot in downtown Champaign.

We picked up cupcakes today, and homemade macaroons for dad. Yum!"}
{"text":"With nearly 30 reviews already, I am not sure what I have to add.  I think this place has a lot of potential but is rough around the edges.  I went with my wife and son so we sampled a lot of things;

I got both a plain croissant and a chocolate croissant (which they should have labeled \"pain au chocolat\"!).  The plain one was good but the chocolate one had the bread all wrong.

My son got a cheese omelete but it was kind of hard on the outside and he didn't like it.

My wife got the chicken pesto crepe, which she said was good.

We also had some samples of a brownie they had out on the table.  

You order at the counter and they give you a number to put on the table and then bring out the food to you when it's ready.

The location is nice (and there's an outdoor part out back).  Bathroom was clean.

Prices are a little high but there are some less expensive items on the menu.  Nothing really wrong with this place, I feel like there's more on the menu to try and I'll probably find a favorite.   I will probably end up checking it out again if I am in the area after I have tried a few other places on my list first.

A 3-star type establishment."}
{"text":"I have never tried their sandwiches before but as far as I know, this is the only place in Chambana that serves Turkish coffee in a small boiling pot. It is not the cheapest definitely but I am just fascinated by it. I just love it when I get to play with tools and make my own food with it =). The atmosphere is just wonderful for studying. The only downside is that it is rather inconvenient for people who don't have cars to stay a little late."}
{"text":"Have been stopping by this place after my shift for quite some time (night shift RN). Last time I stopped by I had the worst customer service I have had in a very long time! Not getting too much into the details but management needs to reevaluate their morning staff. I will not go back EVER again. I can't give it one star because I don't think its fair to the ownership and i really enjoy their pastries and lattes. However I can only give it 3 stars because their rude staff."}
{"text":"This is my favorite cafe and place to grab a bite to eat. The roasted red pepper soup is to die for. If I crave a chai latte, I always go here. I refuse to go to any other place. I sometimes take the bus and it's just a hop, skip, and jump to grab that chai latte then head to work on the bus. I would complain it's always busy, but that's not a substantial complaint. There's always enough staff to accommodate. This place is just so busy because it is so good. Great quality, service, and stays true to the Midwest attitude of friendliness. Ive lived in Champaign my whole life and will continue to go to Pekara as long as it is around. And I hope that is forever."}
{"text":"\"Meh. I've experienced better\".... in Urbana.  

Anyway, This place is really pricey for the amount of food they give you -- delicious, but bordering on frustrating -- let's just say that I am never ordering one of their sandwiches again.

Spring for an almond croissant and your day will be brighter. The ciabatta is great, too."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick breakfast bite.  It's a charming place, with food beautifully displayed and a friendly, welcoming staff.  There's a nice patio in the rear, and the back room with the couches is charming.  Good coffee and tea, the scone was dry and tasty as sawdust, and the almond croissant certainly looked much tastier than it tasted.  They have a nice-looking menu, though, so I might drop in if I am back through the area, but I certainly would not make it a point to revisit."}
{"text":"It was a lifesaver a number of times being close to the Blind Pig and when I am STARVING or if I want to improvise up a few appetizers for guests. They have reasonably priced sandwich combos and I usually go for their italian meat option which often changes from month to month. It is worth trying when you don't feel like something too heavy (Guidos, etc.). A sandwich is always a good complement to your beer too..."}
{"text":"Had both the strawberry and cream crepe and the veggie omelette. The strawberry cream crepe was so delicious! It was creamy and just the right amount of sweet! The omelette was really savory. It had just the right amount of cheese and peppers. 
The bakery has all sorts of sweets. I would love to try them all. There is plenty of seating. Also, plenty of outlets!"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches and their fresh baked breads are amazing,  however their coffee is weak and just overall taste bad."}
{"text":"El bocadito cubano! 

The right crunch, the amount of pickles, mustard and mayo.   I told my friend she can have the other half of the sandwich because I figured that I wouldn't want it because most places that make sandwich cubano make em alright, but they usually deconstruct it like it's some system gone bad. For the record: THERE'S NOT A GOD DAMN THING WRONG WITH EL Sanwich cubano, in theory and in practice!  

The other half of the sandwich is just sitting next to me.  My friend is out on a phone call.  Should I eat it?  The porkiness is peeking thru... taunting me.  Sigh.  I wish she would come back.  Practice will power.  Practice restraint.  You guys!!! 

The other real good place to eat a cuban sandwich is either at my parents house where my dad will throw it DOWN or somewhere in Union City or Hoboken.

Just come here for the cuban sandwich."}
{"text":"Nice quaint bakery and coffee shop. Always delicious and fresh pastries, cookies and cakes. A great way to start a morning, especially on a weekend. Highly recommend the scones, croissants, and lemon bars. Generally relaxing and quiet place to get work done."}
{"text":"Pekara seems to be one of those restaurants that lacks a true identity. It's a bit more upscale in atmosphere and food choices, but the food isn't exactly gourmet. All the items I tried, from bakery goods to omelettes weren't bad but they weren't great (for the price) either. With that said, there's also a lack of upscale cafe/bakeries in general in the area so it's not a bad place to visit for breakfast if you're around."}
