{"text":"Went here with out of town guest last night..hadn't been here in a few years but since the Hoot Owl closed, we picked this place for drinks and food. The food is good, the service slow, and the mix drinks horrible !! I drink scotch n water and you couldn't even see scotch in the glass ! Another drink of vodka tonic was all tonic and after two tries we gave up and left. It's a beer bar if you want a good drink n the wine selection is very limited..won't be back unless I need a beer n burger !!!"}
{"text":"Went in tonight to play darts, have some drinks, and some food.  Waited at a table for over 15 minutes and no service.  My wife then goes up to the bar and asks for a pitcher of beer and inquires about food.  Well, on a Saturday night the kitchen is closed and after 20 more minutes of waiting for our pitcher and 2 rounds of darts later we left since we couldn't manage to get a drink, oh and it wasn't even that busy.  If you want to get ignored go here, otherwise find another dive bar."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing ranch. Best ranch in town. Pretty good drink prices. Depends on what day you go on. Vodka drinks are very expensive compared to other bars. They only have 1 person behind the bar which sometimes takes you forever to get a drink."}
{"text":"Cheers is a good dive bar, The inside is very spacious. They have about 6 state of the art dart boards and 2 pool tables. The people were very friendly and grown. Everyone participated in karaoke in the 4 hours I was there. The two bartenders were a bit quiet but kept the drinks flowing. They're not the best at making cocktails (Amaretto Sour & Liquid Marijuana) but at least they did not shy away from it. I will definitely be going back & this time I will try the food"}
{"text":"I really miss the OLD Cheers. I loved the old bartenders, regulars, and dive-y, chill atmosphere. 

Since they have reopened, I have given Cheers Tavern several opportunities to make me a regular. It seems that this place has no desire to keep the old clientele. It's disappointing that I have lost a place to hang out -- at least there's still Tony's. 

New Cheers is too pricey for a dive bar. I don't see why this place is ever busy because of the prices. Although, if this place was slightly enjoyable, I would gladly pay for their over-priced drinks.

They are competing with the other bars in Glendale, for the douchey-ist bar in the valley. Which is sad because there are so many bro-friendly bars on the westside. None of the old regulars come to this bar and, from what it seems, new Cheers doesn't even attempt to retain the old regulars. Also, the owners' responses to the once-regulars' reactions on the changes are crass and appalling. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL. 

Although, one plus-side is their bathrooms are no longer disgusting -- hence, the one star. 

I miss Sunni, Missy, Jess, and, MORE IMPORTANTLY, everything about the OLD Cheers. Once again, they have lost another paying customer, who was once a loyal regular."}
{"text":"Ok.....so I know the new cheers has big shoes to fill and in no way am I trying to bring down the old cheers as I loved that place as much as everyone else did. As the new Cheers came about I heard a few things and me being who I am I wanted to try it out for myself. I came in with my roommate for the first time and yes it was weird to see the change but immediately I felt comfortable and welcome. It was clean, it smelled good, it looked nice, had a good vibe, nothing that would have turned me away in the first second...but then again I am not one to judge a book by its cover.. So as I sat down and began my night it was nothing but fun. They had karaoke, they had a good crowd, no drama, and overall a good vibe! The owners were down to earth and were nice enough to talk to everyone. I had a great time and there is no question if I will be back.. Since then I have brought my friends in and all of them have enjoyed every minute of it (who were also regulars at the old cheers) and will be back!!! It's good to give something a chance before you immediately bash it. Its is a great place with great people so far...so all the haters can stay at tailgaters.. :)"}
{"text":"Best hot wings in the state!

Good prices, Great food, try the sample plater.

Great place, I liked the old dive bar style a lot better."}
{"text":"No food even though advertised. Drinks are watered down and weak. Very overpriced drinks. Karaoke host was excellent. Lots of singers though,  so you don't get to sing a lot.  Watch out for the dart players as they are rude and in the way."}
{"text":"Not a bad place. Wasnt happy that the bartender ricky was gone but the new girl seems to be really nice. Its a nice low key place to play darts and have a drink."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. It's a pretty solid place to play darts and relax. Lots of nice dart boards. Good atmosphere, too. The lighting is dialed in just right, and they play cool music videos on several non-sports screens.

Overall, the place is clean and well maintained. Service is good; bartender really hustles behind the bar and does table service, too. Drink specials are OK, nothing out of this world, and I'm not a huge fan of plastic beer mugs. Cocktails seem to be light on booze. Food looks pretty decent from what I saw other people getting, and the specials are damn good. 

However, as is becoming a cancer all over Phoenix bars, this place seems to think that vaping is OK to do indoors. When playing darts here last week, we had to walk out it was so bad. My eyes were watering and it smelled like the inside of an ass mixed with cotton candy from all the douchers with oral fixations sucking on alcohol and oil smoke. Seriously gross, why not just allow smoking? 

If you don't mind the possibility of vape stench, this is a great bar. I will come back, but I guess it'll have to be earlier in the day before the goombas come out to stink up the place."}
{"text":"Stopped by on Monday 8/7, got some food for takeout------girl behind the grill in the kitchen kicks A$$  ,\"the chicken in the sliders was super moist & tasty-the homemade ranch dressing along with the other sauces were amazing & the onion rings were super fresh & CRISPY (by the time you get home onion rings are always soggy but not these ones) Will definitely be ordering from Cheers kitchen again"}
{"text":"This is the type of management/ownership running this establishment now.  I posted on the \"Cheers Tavern\" facebook page, saying I disliked the bar because of the management/ownership and received this  inbox message. I of course knew the ego on this guy just couldn't resist replying, obviously just like he does here on the yelp page. 

I quote: 

Tim Montague
GO FUCK YOURSELF you fat FUCK!!! Your little rants/post will never hurt my business...EVER!! Funny 99% of the old Cheers crowd love the new Cheers. The other 1% are the ducebags like you who pissed on the bathroom floor and thought your tough guys by punching holes in the walls.....Don't want you or any of those P.O.S. back in my bar. Don't EVER step foot in Cheers again....you will never be welcome!!!

Classy."}
{"text":"Best Reuben and onions rings! Amazing staff, especially the heads of the bar and kitchen!!"}
{"text":"We've been to Cheers twice months apart to play darts. Both times we've had the reuben and onion rings. We came back for the food and the bartender remembered our food and drink orders before we'd even gotten the menu! Love the atmosphere, wait staff, bar games, food and drinks!!!"}
{"text":"I play darts here every Thursday night. I've only been here one other day, and that was a Sunday morning. Karen is the bartender/server on Thursday night's. She is absolutely amazing. Drinks are never empty, good pour, good prices, food is very good and the atmosphere is a bit of a divey sports bar. I do recommend it."}
{"text":"I've been coming here pre and post new Cheers. The environment now is so much cleaner, more open and much more welcoming to patrons. There are several TVs playing all sports, beers are cold and a great selection of food items. Karaoke and music on the weekends makes for a fun night out! The owners, Tim and Lisa, make it a point to know their customers. Definitely a place I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"So according to my group this isn't the 1st time I'm here must have been a hell of a time because I don't remember ever being here. Nonetheless my review is on the one I remember Thursday 2pm fairly empty  but by 5pm it was starting get some steam. Dart board are top knotch. Waitress cool and very attentive my cup never went empty which explains why I don't remember the 1st time. Good rotating craft beer selection. Billiards."}
{"text":"Food is great and bartenders make you feel at home! Good amount of TVs for football. They also have darts, pool, and a patio! The taco salad was AMAZING! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Genuine neighborhood bar.  Love the owners and the servers. Dave behind the bar and Tim and Lisa the owners are amazing. Darts and karaoke?  This is your one stop shop.  Come in and have a great time.  The wings and nachos are the best."}
{"text":"It's not the same menu anymore as what was mentioned in previous post. Very limited menu. It seems like the food part of the business is leased out because I had to pay upfront for the food order before it was made. Drinks were billed on a separate tab. I would not recommend eating here. Plenty of better choices out there."}
{"text":"Sad day for me.  I've been going to Cheers since about 1989ish?  Wayyyy back.  Burgers and wings were always consistent.  Excellent.
Today's visit, sadly, sucked.  I ordered a short Titos and cranberry, all the short glasses were broke, so I got a tall.  The cranberry is outta of gun and is super sweet so she has to water it down a little to be tolerable.  
There are doing something new with their kitchen and leasing it out so the food and drinks are separate. So I have to pay twice. Super inconvenient.
Next, the food.  We ordered a new item, the street tacos. He puts this really sweet pickled purple onion on them, had to pick those off.  I was not expecting that on a street taco and I've ate tons of em.  Then we ordered regular wings, mild, extra crispy.  I've been eating buffalo wings the same way forever, that's,the way I like em.  These had a slightly sweet flavor to the hot wing sauce. Again, not expecting that.  And did not care for it. My husband thought they were good. You can go and form your own opinion.

This is just my opinion but I have been going there for their burgers and wings forever. I did not try the burger so I can't speak on that.  But I didn't like the wings or the drinks.

Also, staff needs to check their language.  I'm not a prude, but staff shouldn't be swearing out loud in front of customers."}
{"text":"Our group of 7 barely walked in and our waitress was on it with our drink orders. We hardly had to wait at all which was impressive for a busy Friday night.

Just as the description said, it was a sports bar with karaoke and there were definitely both that evening. A lot of people chose classic country songs to sing to. To deal with the singing, our hubbies wandered over to play darts while we, girls, had gummy bear shots and mixed vodka drinks. Although the bar has been described as divey by others, the atmosphere is still inviting and laid back at the same time. 

This bar has been around for years and even expanded. It's nice because it doesn't feel too crowded even with a lot of people there on a Friday night. 

The true stand out to me was the Tatchos. The tater tot nacho hybrid was lathered in BBQ sauce and had Sriracha cream sauce and green onions all over it. It tastes so wonderful with our drinks! Cheers to Cheers Bar!"}
{"text":"What a perfect place!!! Came in for the first time Saturday and was treated like family, thank you Ricky for being so nice to us. Loved it so much came back with the kids on Sunday for the games. Was greeted again like royalty with balloons and reserved tables for us. Will be making this our new regular hangout. Food, service all the best!!!!! Thank you again Ricky."}
{"text":"If you have not been here in several years, it is not the same stale Cheers it was back then. 

The place is clean, brigher, and Cheers'ier. 

The food is better than most bars too. I have had the burger, wings, and chicken. the fries are good too. 

Service \"can\" get a tad slow if they get busy, but once your there, they take care of you. 

The tv's, music, karaoke, shuffleboard, darts, pool...drinks and buddies. It is a perfect bar."}
{"text":"Decent food for bar food. Good service, reasonable price. Come here for football often. Close, convenient, cozy."}
{"text":"Very poor service. Went in after work to unwind with a few drinks. No one approached to take my order after waiting over 20 mins.  Would be understandable but the place was fairly empty"}
{"text":"Love this place! We go to relax and play darts and the staff is super friendly. The food was good but now there's new food that we have yet to try, will report back. It's easy to get too, karaoke on the weekends and super old regulars that are really fun to shoot the shit with on the patio. All in all a great place no matter the day."}
{"text":"Came here on Friday the 18th with family because we were looking for drinks and karaoke. Definitely had that. The waitress, she was excellent for it being her first night. Her name escapes my mind though. The karaoke was different from what I'm used to, with the music being non-stop and the KJ just going through the crowd to find the person who is up to sing. A little hard to find a seat, but it was a Friday night. I would come back!"}
{"text":"Good every day bar. The servers are very good at making sure you don't go dry. Good crowd. Much quieter than Tailgaters. Same sized big brews as Gaters and better prices. This will be me and my friends new hangout."}
{"text":"This place is gross.  The owner gets drunk and yells at the staff.  The bathrooms are gross. Service is slow.  Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Not being a country or a Nascar fan, the bar was nice and clean.  The touch screen was new and nice.  The big miller lite's were reasonably priced at $4.  The bartender was pleasant.  A good time for one in the afternoon."}
{"text":"After an hour of driving around looking for somewhere to eat the bf and I ended up landing back on the couch and ordering from Cheers through ubereats (sorry eat24).

We ordered at around 11pm and got our food at 11:30pm. Super hot and fresh. So much food per item. The bf got his usual cheeseburger with bacon and onion rings. We also got the loaded tator tots and the mac and cheese bites. We had so many leftovers and we pigged out. 

I cant speak for the location itself except that I know its in the corner of a blah shopping plaza. I would very much recommend their food regardless of location."}
{"text":"New ownership, new review!

I always liked Cheers, so when I saw it undergoing renovation this summer, I was a bit hyped. New interior does not disappoint! Great lighting system. Nice TVs everywhere. Lots and lots of comfortable seating. Whoever designed it has the aesthetics on point.

The music also rocks. They play everything! And the sound system had an upgrade--you can NEVER have enough bass.

But I know you know you come here for more than sleek looks and cool sound. You wanna know about the drinks. On Tuesdays, specials include $4 Jager bombs and $2 PBR Tall cans. It doesn't get any better than that. There's also a little food menu, but I'll get back to ya when I try that. 

Staff was very friendly and down-to-earth. I can tell they genuinely enjoy what they do, and that feeds into a fun environment. Cheers has all the foundations of a successful mainstay in the west valley. Like any new establishment, they'll have a little market research and fine tuning before they develop a solid identity, but it still works smoother than any other new bar I've been to. For now--it's all looking up!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite new bar. I came in Monday and they had $6.00 burgers and $2.00 drafts. The bartender was really nice and down to earth. Oh and they have an outdoor patio where you can smoke and drink which is awesome if you're a smoker(I am). I had a great time and it didn't break the bank. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Love this place ... Great vibe great service and Dave behind the bar is spectacular! Cool places to chill or kick it up a notch. Good food great drinks and fair prices!"}
{"text":"This would have been a nice little visit if the bartender wasn't tweaking ....  it's so nice that we went into the bathroom and then came back out and she's gossiping about us to the other bar patrons....won't be back"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot on the west side. Come see for yourself, try the steak, mouthwatering. 
  They have karaoke Tuesdays Fridays and Saturdays. Pool tables, shuffleboard, golf, darts and more. 
  The place is clean. The bathroom is spotless. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food at this place is AMAZING! It was recently taken over by a new chef after a stint of them having no food. He has done great things w/ the kitchen and is providing a variety of awesome bar food w/ a little bit of everything for everyone! The whiskey BBQ wings have the BEST flavor! I loved the mac n cheese bites, easily my new favorite! Also, the tachos are a twist on nachos w/ tater tots! Definitely a fun and amazing item!! Big fan of the corn fritters and my daughter LOVED the burger too! Check it out for sure, the bar staff also did a great job of making sure our dirnks were always full and letting us sample different beers that they had! Amazing place to relax, play darts and pool and just have a good time!!"}
{"text":"Always a good time! I've been here twice so far and it's great they have dart games and pool tables. Friendly staff and inexpensive drinks. Overall love this place and lots of fun!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place.  I'll be honest, I came here for the name.  But I stayed for the fun crowd and good karaoke.  The place doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside it looks brand new and totally remodeled.  There is a large outdoor patio for you smokers, and it has two large heat lamps and rain cover.  If you come here on a weekend, the karaoke is actually pretty good.  The host looks like the guy from that TV show \"The Commish\" and he's a nice guy and does a good job rotating singers so everyone gets a chance.  The service is really good; I have never had a problem getting a drink.  Most of the crowd here is very friendly and chill.  However, I have encountered a few idiot drunks which is why this doesn't get a full 5 stars from me.  The bouncers need to do a better job screening for these people and kick them out when they turn aggressive."}
