{"text":"The service is very very bad here. I've been here like 5 times just to give it a chance, thinking that it would get better, but it didn't.   One time I went there and ordered a combo and the Indian guy gave me horrible attitude when I asked for some bbq sauce (I'm an Indian guy myself). Yesterday I went there and asked for a cup of coffee and they responded \"our coffee is 3 hours old, but, I can microwave it for you.\" They would NOT make fresh coffee lollll! The whopper sandwiches I bought tasted funky too and we threw them out.   This is a horrible place and the workers all have a lot of attitude. Now I know why usually noone's in there whenever I go. I won't be going there anymore.   They also have a lot of negative reviews on google+"}
{"text":"Great location. Typical Burger King food. Came here on Monday, Jan. 30, 2017. The girl at the drive thru was absolutely stunning!! The food was fresh and would definitely recommend and come here again!"}
{"text":"This Burger King location doesnt even deserve a star. Its by far the slowest Burger King I have ever been to and to top it off gave me the wrong order at the drive thru and tried to over charge me when I specifically handed over a coupon. Will go back to BK but never again to this location"}
{"text":"Avoid if possible, I just got food poisoning after couple of hours. Ordered fish burger."}
{"text":"Well... Its just another burger king!  I use to go there when I used to work in the area. The service was fast and the server were quick on moving the line. The seating is pretty nice but it feels like an old location.   There is parking on the location."}
{"text":"I turned in to the drive thru exit lane by accident of course. I couldn't turn around and get out so I had no choice but to drive until the end. People waiting to enter the drive thru we're giving me funny looks. Luckily I didn't crash with anyone head on! Otherwise it's good, it's got a play place which I would go to when I was younger. I don't know if any other bk has a play place."}
{"text":"Dear Burger King,  First off, screw you! I was at this location earlier today and tried the chicken Caesar sandwich. That was at 5:30. After eating it I immediately felt sick to my stomach. I ushered myself to the washroom and painted the toilet bowl with the the inside of my stomach. Its now 8:00 and im putting together this review from my toilet seat. I have a feeling I'll be here for a while. I'm giving this location 1 star because the fountain pop was aiight.  Thank you Burger King!"}
{"text":"terrible. just terrible. they are super incompetent, they just can't get my order right.  its not rocket science, but the employees there are brain dead. ordered 20 nuggets, gave me 10.  order onion rings will always get me fries.  order 3 combos, missing 1 order of fries. order large fries and medium onion rings get me 2 medium fries.  terrible service on top of everything."}
