{"text":"Food great, unfortunately they play country music entirely to loud during dinner hours.  No thanks, will only be ordering take out from now on"}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Service and food  was very good.  Pepperoni rolls and burgers were excellent!!!"}
{"text":"A group of 8 friends and myself came to the Breakaway for dinner. We were all pleasantly surprised by the large portions and how delicious everything looked and tasted! Their food was much better than other comparable local restaurants. I had one of their signature pizzas found on the menu, chicken, spinach, pesto! Yum!"}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight after spending a day skiing at Boyce Park.We had two teenage boys with us who, along with us were quite hungry from skiing, we ordered the wings, cheese fries, the chicken salad, and a philly cheese steak. Everything was GREAT! So good! Not to many places with full Wings anymore. Done perfect! Our server was very nice and we basically had the place to ourselves on a slow Sunday evening! We will be back. Very pleased!"}
{"text":"Such a cozy feeling walking in..  so festive for the holidays. The hostess was busy seating the party that walked in right before us.. and I was pleasantly surprised that the bartender offered to seat us.   That was really nice.  In fact all the staff was nice.   Typical menu - BUT all the good stuff that we patrons love.  It was a nice simple menu.  My boyfriend was really  - really looking forward to the \"Mozzarella Puck\" but unfortunately they were out of that item on the menu. It must be a popular item.   We will be calling ahead of time before visiting again to ensure they have it.    Being a huge steak lover.. I liked the fact that there was a \"philly cheesesteak \" and  a \"steak n cheese\" on the menu - two different menu items.     I ordered the steak and cheese - taking a vacation from onions and peppers.. and the steak was super fresh and plentiful.   The fries were fresh cut and decent portion.  It was probably one of the better steak and cheese's I have had.   The Fiery burger (I got to sample) was good - and definitely up there - would rate a top notch burger.     It did take a little time for our food to come but was worth it.   The restaurant was busy.   We weren't there long but when we left I noticed I smelled like I was cooking over a grill for hours.    The service was good and no doubt so was the food. I will be returning.   Thanks Break Away Bar and Grill."}
{"text":"Have been going there to play Zoachtrivia . Lots of fun!!! But this place is ALWAYS freezing cold in this place like they are afraid to turn the heat up!! And it doesn't matter where you sit!! Burgers are good & juicy and thick but difficult to enjoy your food when you are freezing and trying to eat with your coat on!!"}
{"text":"The food is good and I've never had a problem getting a table. People are great but it seems like there is always a long wait for your food. If you aren't in a hurry this is a welcoming place to watch games."}
{"text":"Great food, good beer selection, and wonderful staff! you can never go wrong with any sandwich or appetizer, and always a good beer/drink special available.  Bartenders and managers very hospitable and great with customers."}
{"text":"Lucked into this joint at a hockey tournament next door. Don't let the outside fool you the food is 5 Star! Pizza and Calzones are excellent , salads are fresh and huge !"}
{"text":"Best place to get a drink after playing a hockey game.  Food is not the best and there could be more options. The pizza is solid. The rolls are good. Do not order the wings.   Drink options and prices are great."}
{"text":"Food was great! Loved the pepperoni rolls and the zamboni fries! Service was sub par. They hustled at first; however the server entirely forgot our pizza. When we inquired, she proceeded to blame it on the kitchen. She never apologized, nor did she offer a discount. She coerced us into paying our tab and did not offer to get us any additional food or beverage. Furthermore, she did not pass on to another server that we intended to stay and eat and drink-even though we explicitly stated that. We stayed for 45 minutes waiting to order more food and have our drinks refilled. Our plates were cleared and we were not offered additional food/drink. No one addressed us. L  Overall: good food, bad service."}
{"text":"We frequent the Breakaway for Happy Hours.  They have a nice beer selection and  their chicken tenders are pretty great.  Service is always very prompt.  If it is a nice day, sit outside, you might no know it is there,  but it is comfortable and quiet."}
{"text":"Place is very dirty, service non existent, food sub par. Why do places like this exist? Just get out of the bar biz. It ain't working. Oh and get rid of the gnats, it's appalling."}
{"text":"Very good wings and what a price on Tuesday. Dollar wing night.... yings & wings. The atmosphere is definitely cozy but that's what I expected. The wings are amazing. I honestly have yet to try anything else because the wings are the star for me!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE BREAKAWAY! By far the best pizza in town and the rest of the food is amazing as well! Especially the burgers and ranch dressing! Also it's hockey lovers paradise! Let's go Pens!"}
{"text":"Loved the pepperoni rolls - order of 5 - should have ordered 2 orders.  Absolutely fabulous!  Would like to try the feta rolls next time.  Service was good - Ashley was very accommodating!  Onion rings, chips were hot through the entire meal."}
{"text":"This place is just ok.   Nothing special.   Marginally decent bar food.   Had a pizza because I was was the most appealing item on the menu.  Again, just ok."}
