{"text":"The good:

The shish taouk tasted ridiculously healthy, which would normally put me off.  However, the beef was quite flavourful, as were the ingredients placed into the sandwich.  I'm not 100% sure, but the hummus could have been store-bought.  Nevertheless, it tasted good and I felt quite energized after eating it.  The chicken shawarma was tastier than the shish taouk (albeit greasier with the garlic sauce).  My partner lamented about the lack of toasting on the pitas (oh Boustan, why can you not open a location on the shore), but the sandwiches still stood up pretty well, despite the lack of warmth.

The bad:

Being a lover of potatoes with garlic sauce/mayo, I was disappointed.  Upon first sight, the potatoes were the most gorgeous shade of golden-brown... a visual testament to their crispy goodness.  The reality, however, had me feeling deceived and robbed of deliciousness.  The potatoes were greasy and the garlic mayo was a congealed mess that failed to coat the overly-greased and soggy potatoes.  A \"fail\" on two fronts.

Would I come back again?

Sure, I've experienced better, but I would come back again.  I am willing to overlook the potato debacle in favor of the flavorful pitas.  I am even more enticed by the \"shish taouk poutine,\" which I intend on feasting upon my next visit."}

{"text":"We were Looking for a good quick libanese restaurant and we saw this one on Taschereau boul. 
This place was quiet, not alot of people around 1pm on a saturday afternoon. That was surprising! But what surprised us was the flavor of the chicken when we ate the shishtaouk plate! Sooo good! 
The potato was well cooked  and the rice as well.

The staff was very friendly and the service was very good. I'm definitely going back and I totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian so this might not be a popular choice for me, however the salads are so good that I just had to come back for more. They're always fresh and there's a good variety of them. My friend who loves chicken really loved the flavourful shish taok sandwiches and plates!"}
{"text":"Great place for some shish taouk! I find it taste better than Amir's and it is slightly cheaper as well. Only drawback is that they do not accept credit cards."}
{"text":"First off, the owner was extremely nice!! I'm a vegetarian, he catered to my needs. The tabbouleh was excellent!"}
