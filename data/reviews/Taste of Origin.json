{"text":"I live very close to this restaurant and I've seen the change of ownership of this place several times over the years.   I decided to give it a try last week and found the atmosphere, service and the food was very good.  

I found the place wasn't big, maybe they have 15 to 20 tables.  But we were sitting very comfortable.  Not like some small restaurants where they try to put as many tables as they can in a tiny space they have.  All tables have table clothes, no plastic sheets over them.
After we placed our food order, the waitress brought over a small dish of appetizer.  It was sour cabbage, like kimchi.  Next came our complimentary soup, which I find sometimes it's not being offered in some chinese restaurant nowadays.  Two free dishes so far...bonus.

We ordered the oysters with ginger and green onions,  free-range chicken, seafood with Chinese broccoli and spicy tender pork.  All dishes were a generous portion.  There were eight pieces of oysters and it was my favorite dish.  They were tasty and not oily at all.  

We were given a 10% discount.  I think it's because they just reopened recently.  The total was $42 with taxes so the price was very reasonable.  We liked it so much we've made reservation for Chinese New Year.

{"text":"Revisit this restaurant again and the price of the set menu has been adjusted quite a lot. We order the set dinner menu for 8. The portion is large enough for 10 people. 

It includes soup, double fried lobster, Peking duck, fries duck meat mix, steamed fish and we exchange a Vancouver crab. The duck is average. The lobster and the fish though are very tasty and fresh. It was $99 only. No restaurant can beat that price. But now it is $168.  Although there is an increase, it is still cheap."}
{"text":"Family came here for a Chinese New Year Day dinner. It was maybe half empty. I guess people do really celebrate on the eve. 

The food was not spectacular. Some dishes were too salt, while some others weren't salty enough. The peking duck was a bit dry. The only thing I really liked was the deep fried lobster tail. Everything else was unremarkable. 

The service was good and the food came out quickly but I don't think I'll be visiting here again."}
{"text":"Taste of Origin is the third restaurant that opened up at this location within a year or so.... And unfortunately I don't think they would stay open for too long if they don't improve the quality of the food and the services...

My friend was really hungry.... and when someone is hungry, everything should taste good... at least decent... but 

Pickled Duck Feet ($4.99)
- We originally ordered Wasabi chicken feet...but after waiting for 20 minutes, the waitress informed us they all sold out?? and she suggested duck feet instead....20 minutes to found out that something precooked are sold out??? 
- Really really bland tasting!! Practically tasted like just cooking in boiling water and just let them cool down and serve...
- My friend said her mother can made them better at home...maybe I should just eat at her house!

Original Handmade Noodle with Fu Zhou Fish Balls ($7.99)
- My friend said my cooking taste better than this bowl of noodles... need I say more?
- Fish ball was undercooked, noodles was undercooked really hard and chewy.. and the soup was tasteless
- $8?? with 3 fish balls that tasted like from the freezer of a nearby Chinese supermarket??? and just handful of noodles? Maybe it is good since it tasted so bad...no point to get plentiful of bad food.....

Taste of Origin has this Cantonese and Fu Zhou menu.. which can be really interesting since if you are a seafood lover, you would love the selections of  Fu Zhou's seafood. 

Sadly I don't think I would be coming back to try them out.again..."}
