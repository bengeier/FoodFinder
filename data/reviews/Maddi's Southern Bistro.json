{"text":"Maddi's is a charming place for a casual but elegant lunch.  The food nods to Southern influence but does not require a fondness of or even familiarity with Southern cooking to appreciate it."}
{"text":"The service was extremely slow and the food wasn't even that great. Do not go here during your lunch break, or you will end up waiting about 1.5 hours total for your entire meal."}
{"text":"Really outstanding food....this is a restaurant first and gallery 2nd.  I found the \"art\" really tacky to be honest, but the cuisine is phenomenal.  I thought the menu lacked a little bit of creativity and selection, but the execution was perfect.  The fried chicken was absolutely perfect.  I would strongly recommend reservations for this place...they turn the tables over very slowly and it is a small restaurant."}
{"text":"Dear Sarah M., Maddis is more a gift shop then an art gallery, but I think you missed the charm of the place because you were hung up on terminology.  Sure the stuff is mass produced, but much of it is unique and exclusive.  I guess you would have to define art.  The jewelry, which is what takes me there at least 3 times a year (wife's Birthday, X-mas and Anniversary) is unique from artist who you will simply not find in the big boxes.  Try going back with an open mind and look for a bit of whimsie.  You might be surprised how fun of an experience it really is."}
{"text":"Very interesting space and nice.  Thought the food was a little over priced for what you got.  If you like southern cuisine you will like this place."}
{"text":"A cool gallery that now has a bistro restaurant inside.  We had brunch there this past Sunday (7/6/08) and I fell in love with the place.  The waiter was awesome.  No hurrying you for the next round of patrons.  Brunch was wonderful; well priced, good portions, and delicioius.  As a bonus, we browsed the gallery next door after we ate.  A definite must for any Charlottean looking for a new brunch spot."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, Maddi's at Birkdale has closed. It was very good. :("}
{"text":"A friend and I ate here yesterday (5/13/09) and instantly fell in love.  The decor and table settings are extremely charming.  The bistro is attached to an art gallery that features art and handcrafted pieces from local artists.  My friend was interested in trying this place because of the fried green tomato BLT and she said that it did not disappoint!   I ordered the turkey pita wrap with black eyed pea hummus (that I requested on the side) asiago french fries with a cucumber rittiata (sp?) dipping sauce.  My meal was delicious! In fact, I have been thinking about it all day.    All of the ingredients were fresh and extremely flavorful.  The hummus tasted like they had just prepared it as I ordered (and not took it out of a pre-made package).  The only gripe I had was that my turkey pita was served in a tortilla NOT a pita.  For beverages, we both ordered the White Peach Iced Tea and it was very refreshing.  I found the prices to be quite reasonable, not at all extravagant.  The price of my turkey wrap was $8.50 and the drink was $2.50. About the same as you would pay at any mid-level chain restaurant.  I look forward to coming back and trying the fried green BLT and just about everything else on the menu.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Went to Maddi's for Sunday brunch and the food was delicious.  Started with a cup of good coffee and yummy fried green tomatoes.  Then we waited. And waited. And waited. Finally got to place our order.  I had the Portabello Wrap, which was well cooked, but over-mustard-ed.  The spicy mustard took over the sandwich and kind of killed my tastebuds a bit.  My dining partners had an omelet and gumbo (reviewed favorably), the fried green tomato BLT (which disappeared off the plate quickly enough to indicate its deliciousness) and the \"Birkdale Breakfast\" (which was on par, but not fantastic).  Assuming the wait for our waiter was not a regular thing, but a fluke of the day, I'd recommend this place for a delicious, \"new southern\" brunch."}
{"text":"I am not really sure where to start on this one:  the service was mixed.  The lady waitresses were fantastic--they knew their stuff, and were kind and engaging.  The men of the house were awful in every sense: sassy, lazy, rude, bad servers and poor drink mixers. (When I pointed out that he had substituted 2 ingredients in a drink and was missing a third, he said \"yeah...we don't have the right stuff anymore.\"  When I pointed to it on shelf behind him, he just walked away.)  We have gone twice in the past week, and both times the food was pretty blah.  It was oversalted (and I LOVE salt!), overcooked, and a lot of good ideas just missed the mark.  For example, the mac and cheese was insanely soggy, the fried chicken was dry and the french toast with apples had tough, unpeeled apples inside, and already had the syrup poured on top when it arrived at the table. Who does that?  I was excited to try this place after all the goods reviews, but after going twice and experiencing the same problems both times, I would say that they have either gotten lazy or had a change of staff.  Yes, the art can be a bit charming, but most of it was just plain tackiness disguised as cuteness.  Highly NOT recommended, especially for the money."}
{"text":"Maddi's is a cool, quirky find. All of the dinnerware and glassware are handmade, which really adds to the charm. We have been there many times for dinner, and brunch is also good. They also serve these delicious sweet potato muffins with both brunch and dinner that are to die for. However, we have noticed that Maddi's has declined over the last couple of months.  During our latest visit, the shrimp with grits was truly tasteless - there was no seasoning in the dish!  On two occasions, they have been unable to make martinis because they were out of alcohol.  What?!  The fried chicken, while still tasty, has shrunk in portion size.  Their soups are ALWAYS so thick it's like eating sludge.  However, we still go back because some dishes are consistently good (like the filet mignon or the fried green tomato sandwich).  If you want southern cooking, I would suggest giving Maddi's a try, just don't expect perfection."}
