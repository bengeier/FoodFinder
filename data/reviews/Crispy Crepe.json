{"text":"I went to this Crispy Crepe for breakfast on the 4th of July. It's a cute and quaint restaurant. You have the option to sit inside or out. I ordered the egg and veggie omelette that was nothing but amazing! My side of fruit (melon and pineapples) was freshly cut and delicious. The crepe is huge so come hungry. Parking is easy. There's a free parking garage behind the building or you can park on the street. This is definitely a new favorite spot for me. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Got a tasty several cheese (3 maybe?) crepe. Will definitely be going back for a sweet one sometime. Service was good and pretty quick. Worth the price of admission in my book, especially considering the prices were relatively cheap."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the menu options here and the texture of the crepes. In terms of savory crepes, there aren't many options and the combinations just aren't appetizing. Hazelnuts uptown is hands down better for options, taste, crepe texture and also about $2 a crepe cheaper."}
{"text":"They really close whenever they want to. Came here 20 minutes before close and they told us they are not open. Even tried calling before arriving but they didn't even pick up. I'm here from California so really sad and disappointed that I couldn't even try this place. Heard good things but hey I'll never know now."}
{"text":"I had a friend in town who loves crepes, so we gave Crispy Crepes a try. The restaurant was cozy and quaint. The service was wonderful. We both split an asparagus/Caesar salad, savory cheese crepe, and sweet peanut butter/chocolate crepe. We each also ordered one of their special lattes. Everything was delicious. We were stuffed and happy for the rest of the day!"}
{"text":"We've had the sweet, we've had the savory and I'm not sure which was more delightful.  Great flavors, rich and wonderful.... Can't wait to experience more of the great offerings from this JEM! And to boot, they serve Coca-Cola!  A match made in heaven!  We will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you are visiting or passing through (or no where near) South End - make some extra time in your schedule to visit this place! And make sure to ask for the amazing Sophia! She was a fantastic server"}
{"text":"Was nervous to go here based on some yelp reviews but I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. Went for brunch on A Saturday morning and was seated immediately outside in the beautiful weather. The waitress implied that the sweet crepes were not large enough to be a full meal, but I was pleasantly supposed at how big my maple crush cheesecake crepe was. It Totally filled me up. There was definitely too much maple cream filling but everything else was perfect. It even came with a chocolate covered strawberry and dollop of whipped cream. My friend got the bruschetta crepe and seemed equally pleased with her choice. Service was superb and we were taken care of very well. The prices seem a little steep, esp for the sweet crepes that don't have any meat in them, so I took off one star, but I am already craving another crepe and will definitely be back. It also looks like they do call ahead and pick up as I saw one girl walk up with her dog and hand her credit card to a server outside who then returned with a to go bag for her. Being within walking distance to all the southend apts is a plus."}
{"text":"Mixed experience at best - I debated giving two stars. I don't plan on returning.

Pros: My gluten-free buckwheat crepe was quite tasty and the filling had fresh, properly cooked ingredients. Even eggs were perfectly done and the arugula was unbruised. When I needed help, the manager was great.

Cons: Sides were meh. The au gratin that my husband had apparently tasted like it came from a frozen foods section, not a restaurant.

However, service was the real problem.

1) Weeks before eating here, I walked in to discuss gluten-free options when I happened to be in the area. I was told that they do gluten-free orders frequently (as you'd expect since they carry a gluten-free crepe batter) and was told that they can make anything on the menu without gluten! This sounded too good to be true but the hostess insisted that this was the case. Of course, it isn't true, and I have no idea why she said so.

2) When I visited, they nearly gave up our table because they couldn't find us when it was ready. Where were we? Sitting in the waiting chairs right in front of them! Thank goodness one of our party went up to check up on them. Again, I have no idea why this happened.

3) The waitress had a remarkable amount of trouble understanding my gluten-free order. I'd ask a question about whether an item was gluten-free, and she'd respond by saying something about the item that had nothing to do with whether it contains gluten. This went on for several menu items until she started to say something about how they didn't really do gluten-free crepes and that maybe I should look at other menu items, which of course is not true and I have no idea why she said it. We finally asked for her to get a manager or chef to recommend gluten-free options. When the manager came, he was great at answering my questions and making basic allergy accommodations the way most restaurants do. Now, while it's a bit silly for a server not to know which items are gluten-free in a restaurant that's gone to the trouble of having a special gluten-free crepe batter, I don't really have a problem with a server not having all that memorized. The problem was that she wasn't offering to help us figure things out or check and, indeed, she didn't seem to understand basic questions well enough to give an on-topic answer! Yet again, I have no idea what was going on with that."}
{"text":"This place was ok...I ordered the Egg 'n' Turkey Bacon Waffle Platter, the eggs were fine, nothing to write home about, the waffle was burnt on the outside and not cooked on the inside and way too sweet. The potatoes were not 'au gratin', they were more like mashed pototatoes, but with some salt and pepper they were fine.

My boyfriend ordered the peanut butter and chocolate chip crepe, which was really yummy...probaby too sweet for a breakfast, but something we would probably go back and split for a dessert.

And as some other reviewers have mentioned, there doesn't seem to be proper ventilation from the kitchen, the whole place is kind of hazy and full of smoke from the kitchen. Sit outside if you can, at least until they install some overhead vents for their open kitchen.

We'll probably give this place another chance...but we'll see."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the food is always great!  Come early on the weekends because they are busy. The only downside is that my apartment's plumbing always gets overwhelmed by all the pooping my friends and I have to do afterwards."}
{"text":"I had the banana and nutella crepe and it was AMAZING! I wouldn't recommend their coffee--I have drank my coffee black for over six years now and I had to put cream and sugar in mine (first time in a VERY long time). I talked to a few other people that felt the same. I'm not sure what kind they use. I'm sure their lattes are fine. Our waitress was very nice. It may take them a hot minute to get to you but overall the service was good."}
{"text":"I should start by saying that my husband enjoyed his breakfast very much and the service was very good.  However I would strongly recommend that people avoid ordering the salmon crepe.  The quality of the smoked salmon is very poor and tasted like salmon jerky, additionally the goat cheese in the description was completely missing.  Additionally, I am a little bit of a coffee snob an the coffee they serve reminded me of bad hotel coffee."}
{"text":"The crapes are flavorful  and have several unique options. If you are in the mood for something more traditional in a crape you won't be disappointed. Service here it's some of the best in the city. On weekend mornings be prepared to wait a while for the tastiest treats in South End."}
{"text":"My wife and I live nearby and really like the atmosphere and clientele at the Crispy Crepe. However, the last two times we've been there have been bad experiences. One time we were seated outside, ordered our food, and waited more than 50 minutes before it came out. The second time, we ordered an Egg, Bacon, Cheese omelet for brunch to go, and when we got it home it was a vegetable omelet - not even close! If you can't get my order right, and when you do, it takes almost an hour, I will definitely take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"We went last weekend and had a great experience (as usual).  We each got a chocolate peanut butter waffle and it was fantastic.  I usually get a cookies 'n cream waffle that they will make even though it is not on the menu.  Everything we have had here has been great!  It is definitely a place that we go to for a treat.  We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast on the weekend. Quiet noise level, but busy. Located right on South Blvd, there is plenty to watch as you eat. I had the Banana Pecan waffle, which was delicious. Paired with fresh fruit and a latte, it's my new favorite place to go on the weekend."}
{"text":"Fresh fruit and ingredients for the crepes, omelettes and fruit cups. Eggs were perfectly fluffy and tasty.  Coffee was too acidic for my preference, but maybe not for others. Service was fast for our Friday brunch. I'd definitely come again. Delish!"}
{"text":"Waffle was awesome. Chipotle crepe was delicious and the chocolate peanut butter crepe was sweet, very sweet and I like that.  Crepe was not crispy but a chewier doughy type, which was fine for me, I like of that way.  Got a groupon to come here (never heard of it till then) and I will return."}
{"text":"Tasty food, great friendly service and good coffee. What more can you ask for on a cloudy Saturday morning."}
{"text":"Hey I'd give this place a thumbs up. Not alot of crepe spots in the Queen City, but hey. That's ok hit up Crispy Crepe for waffles, crepes or lunch. During my visit I endulged in the Cannoli Crepe ( pretty delishnessous) and the chedder and veggie crepe. The chedder and veggie was much healthier, but hey you gotta mix it up to keep them LB's off. The crispy crepe has healthy options and endulgence.  If I'm looking for a crepe or some waffles I'll will return."}
{"text":"I've been here twice.  The first time I ordered the waffle and I thought it was good, not great.  It had the lovely caramelized sugar nuggets that we all love, but I thought the waffle itself was a bit dense.  
Before I gave it a review, I wanted to give it a fair shot and order the restaurant's namesake, a crepe.  I'm so glad I went back!  The crepe was phenomenal!!!  I ordered the gyro crepe and was very happy.  The portion was huge and the filling was great.  It's something I honestly don't know if you'll be able to find anywhere else in Charlotte.  For dessert I got the S'Mores crepe to take home to my husband.  Once we started eating it, I realized I should've ordered two!  Again, excellent.  The only thing that keeps me from giving this place 5 stars was the slight disappointment in the original waffle.  I'll definitely be returning and ordering more crepes."}
{"text":"The service here was absolutely horrible. I saw servers walking around looking like they had nothing to do and bus people being extremely slow busing tables. However, due to it being Sunday there was a decent amount of people waiting for tables. We put our name on the list and waited. A couple that came in 10 minutes behind us were seated before we were and I had two people in my party. There were 6 to 8 servers and everyone at every table were having issues or problem with how slow service was, getting checks or even drinks. Once we are finally seated we ordered immediately because we saw how slow service was. It took them over 55 minutes serve us their special of the day and one of the regular menu items. My wife order to tea and it came with no spoon, she asked for more  sugar and that came 10 minutes later. I ordered a water and I couldn't get brought back until my food came out. Again due to the slow service I asked for the check when the food came out. It probably took them another 20 minutes to come pick up the check.

All that being said about this problems with the servers and the staff being slow, the food did taste very good and I would go there again but maybe just to pick up food."}
{"text":"The prices are way too high and the food is bad. You have been warned!"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for good crepes and decided to give the  restaurant a try. The crepes were ok, however my daughter ordered a waffle. When the waffle arrived, it was yeasty and raw in the middle. The server said that people were complaining earlier in the morning that the waffles were overcooked, so the kitchen instead of cooking the waffles correctly, went in the other direction and now it was undercooked. The waitress took the waffle away and my daughter ordered a bacon/cheese croissant. The server said that the waffle couldn't be removed from the check, so we were charged for a waffle that was not edible and a dry and stale bacon cheese croissant that she couldn't eat. We asked to speak to a manager and the owner came over to the table and said that he was sorry and that was it!!! Over $50 of LESS than average food, which half of it was not edible..we will not be back!"}
{"text":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. 

  I just recently went here last Thursday around 10am to an uncrowded restaurant.  My server approached my friend and I to get our drink orders and seemed to be kind of in a rush to get back to her circle of server friends/breakfast eating at a table in plain sight at the back of the restaurant.  We both ordered the waffles with peppered turkey bacon selection, hastily as not to ruin my server's busy social life. I added a $3 topping choice to my waffle of strawberries and nutella, JUST strawberries and nutella nothing else. Our food arrived in a decent time, but was completely unseasoned and not necessarily appetizing. Our eggs were a little undercooked, which happened to be fine with me but not my friend. Our potatoes that were scooped from a steam well lacked flavor completely. Our COLD waffles possessed a yeasty almost raw taste(which we were later told is a common complaint among diners, and yet they haven't tried to fix it) and mine was topped with an excessive amount of whipped cream and chocolate syrup in addition to the strawberries and nutella,  that I hadn't ordered. It was pretty, but unwanted. And for this to be an open kitchen the line cook could have been a little more inviting to watch prepare our food. In an open kitchen, you're on display and most times people's entertainment for their meal. However, don't worry our server only popped back in enough to quickly see if we were ready for dessert(as if I could stomach that with the heaping pile of whipped cream I had on my waffle, nice selling tactic though) and for the check. I felt as though we were some what neglected,  until I noticed the table next to us barely be attended and then stumble across an error in their bill because they were trying to use a Groupon. I don't know the full situation, but their server kindly handed the situation over to who I assume was the manager who stood behind the counter the entire time and never cared to check on this table or anyone else, but the lady didn't seem to get her problem resolved. When she walked back to her seat she was confronted by her server explaining to her it was \"corporate's\" fault. I do have to admit that wasn't my burden to harbor, but the management team seems to be lacking severely here for letting their service team get away with what they do. The servers need to actually act like they like to work there, regardless if they do or not. I feel as though I paid A LOT of money to be pissed off and unhappy with this place. I didn't even bother getting our server to comp anything(not that I think they would after reading reviews on here) or to speak with the manager (if she should be so bothered). Its not like me to write reviews of places further than giving the stars, but I'd like to let people know DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME,  MONEY, OR ENERGY TO GO HERE!"}
{"text":"Easy parking. Food and coffee are great (and also, I am pretty sure the food is halal)& great service"}
{"text":"We had a late lunch on a Tuesday and loved it!  I had the tomato and arugula salad and my friend had bruschetta crepe.  The dressing and fresh mozz on my salad were delightful and the Au gratin potatoes they serve with the crepes are so good!  Iced late was good and service was decent."}
{"text":"We were really excited to try this place.  The crepe filling had great flavor but the actual crepe was very tough and chewy.  If you have ever had a good crepe you will not be at all impressed.  The waffle was just okay.  If it sticks around for a while I'm sure we'll hit it again to see if they have changed their batter.  Everything was fresh with good intentions but a commitment to one particular item means it has to be special.  It certainly was not special.  

The decorating is a bit awkward and appears unfinished.   Our food runner was very pleasant though a bit nervous.  I was still hungry when I left.  More calories burned chewing than ingested.  Best of luck Crispy Crepe."}
{"text":"My favorite brunch spot in Charlotte! Try the cookie butter latte! Incredibly delicious. For brunch, the Mediterranean crepe is a savory treat or for something sweet/amazing, enjoy the Nutella and strawberry crepe. It is packed with fresh strawberries and tastes like heaven! This restaurant also makes you feel like you're in Paris. What could be better?! Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch with my girlfriend and we had the best service! The food came out quick and it was quite delicious. We will be coming back soon!!"}
{"text":"If you get tricked into going to a niche cafe-type place by your friends when you aren't paying attention, hope that it's this place.
They have standard breakfast items, but I don't really know why anyone would order anything other than a crepe from a place called Crispy Crepe; so you can do what I did and ignore the few elitist reviews on here about turkey bacon and other nonsense.
I ordered a maple creme crepe, my friends ordered 'savory crepes' which are more meal-ish than the deserts. And because we all got to-go boxes and they all were forgotten in my fridge, I was able to take my pick from multiple delicious crepes this morning.
Their espresso is really nice and though I usually take cream and sugar, it was great just black.
One of my friends got a nutella milk shake which was awesome.
Expect to pay about $11 and some change for any crepe on the menu and that includes tax. If you get one of the 'savory crepes', chances are you'll have to take some home, so the price isn't bad at all.
If you're in the area, and there's not a crazy wait-time, it's a great place to stop in."}
{"text":"I bought a Living Social coupon to try this restaurant, i would have never have known about it otherwise.  The casual atmosphere will shock you with the gourmet food you will receive.  My daughter ordered the Roastbeef panini and loved it.  I had the shrimp crepe and my husband had the chicken chipole crepe.  We all LOVED our entrees!  For dessert  my daughter ordered the oreo crepe.  She loved it, but for me it was sugar overload.  my husband and I shared the Cookie butter waffle.  There are not words!!!!  Carmelized crispy sugar, bananas whipped creme!!!  We are already planning our next trip.  I read the comment about no coffee refills, that must have changed, we were offered free coffee refills, and had fast and very courtiest  service.  Love, love love this restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"Giggity giggity, giggity GOOD!

I am a serious fan of crêpes...and the Crispy Crepe must be a serious fan of me!  I'm not sure if there is anything that could knock a star off my five, based on the food alone.  We came here to grab a bite after the Charlotte \"Thunder Road\" marathon last weekend.  I am so glad we did!

Like many of my other reviews say...don't go to a steakhouse and review the chicken.  Enough said...get the crêpes.  

Which one should I get?  I got the Apple Streusel Crêpes.  Made from fire-roasted apples in a cinnamon caramel sauce, some crème fraîche, candied walnuts and a delicious crumble...you can't go wrong here.  Sooooo good!

As for the service and ambiance...you'll be fine.  In fact, the service is nice and so is the ambiance of the place.  Might get a tad warm...so take off your jacket.

Try:  Any of the crêpes

Avoid:  The Saturday morning rush hour"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Not a fan of smelling like food after leaving a restaurant (I usually eat outside during the warm months) but it's totally worth it lol."}
{"text":"When for a Sunday meal after church and was very disappointed.  The five of us (2 adults and 3 children) wait an hour for a table.  The staff act dumb founded as to how to find us a table.  We saw other who came in after us and got seated with little to no wait.  For the price the food was ok, but does not deserve a second visit. If wasn't for the rain and the hassle of driving somewhere else and getting the family wet again, then we would have left before seating. In a nutshell: seat can be limited and the staff is clueless.  I don't for see this place staying open too long."}
{"text":"Randomly found this place because of google reviews. Never been a big fan of crepes but decided to try one. I got the chocolate peanut butter one, it was super sweet but delicious! I could've eaten it as a dessert. I can't remember what my boyfriend got but he was pleased as well. The latte I drank was good too! The service was slow, especially since they weren't busy at all."}
{"text":"Breakfast is my favorite meal so I was anxious to try Crispy Crepe.  I went back and forth between the crepes and waffles, but settled on the Cookie Butter Liege waffle.  It was outstanding!  Great mixture of crunchy and chewy texture topped with bananas and whipped cream.  I was worried it was going to be too sweet, but it wasn't.  

Don't forget to order a latte.  I had a hazelnut latte and I would say it was the best latte I have ever had!  

Service was excellent.  A little pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"I love their crêpes; the place is very cozy and clean, and the staff is very friendly and polite."}
{"text":"Waffles taste like cardboard in a press.  Never coming back.  

I came because of the good reviews.  I should have stuck with the Terrace Cafe."}
{"text":"Came here on Friday after dinner for dessert. 

-Prices: I thought the prices were pretty high. I think we paid $10 for one of the dessert crepes.

-Food: We ordered the maple crunch crepe to split. It was good, the filling was super thick though....nothing excellent. The best part about the crepe was the chocolate covered strawberry that came with it!

-Service: Nothing spectacular. Got us drinks, took our order, brought us food, and brought us the check. Just the basics.

-The problems: We arrived at 8:20pm on Friday night. The place closes at 9pm. We walked in and got a seat. There were a handful of other groups in there eating. Right after we ordered, they started stacking the chairs on top of the tables all around us. This was around 8:30! It was extremely distasteful and made us not want to be in there. We quickly ate our crepe and left. I worked in the food industry for many years and know that balance as an employee of wanting to close up, clean up, and get out of there as quick as possible. But putting the chairs on top of the tables 30 minutes before close, is probably crossing the line a bit! I really hope owners/management is reading this because if the place looks closed before it is actually closed, there goes evening sales. 

Unfortunately, we most likely will not return. We really aren't high maintenance people when it comes to eating place (actually we are probably some of the easier customers to please cause we are so passive!), but when I don't feel welcome, I don't want to be there."}
{"text":"I went here with my Mom after we dropped my daughter off for a 3 week trip to Greece and thought crepes would be a great reminder when my daughter and I were in Greece a few years back.

The staff were so pleasant and I loved our waitress who assured us our choices were good ones.  Seeing the portions were huge, I had the vegetable & cheese and split it w/ Mom. Our waitress asked if we're sharing and served us each half. Thank goodness because it was stuffed and would have been a mess trying to divide it. We had to get a sweet crepe so decided to split the Apple.....oh my!!!  That hit the spot...yes sweet but don't put sugar in your coffee because I wldnt have them change a thing.

All the previous complaints, I didn't experience but the tables weren't filled at 11:30 on a Tuesday.

I will be back with Hubby soon!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and feel like it goes downhill each time there. The atmosphere is plain and boring (let's throw up some French decor to make it feel right type of feel). The portions are so tiny for what you pay for. I ordered the 'special' of pumpkin spice crepes and they tasted good. The problem was I was starving when I left the restaurant. Aside from that, there was no price attached to the 'special.'  Come to find out it costs almost $15. Long story short breakfast cost almost $35 for two people and I felt like I had been had this last time. Batter and cream cheese and the effort to make it doesn't cost nearly what they charge. This used to be the only 'creperie' in town but now there are plenty others who I feel offer better food and quality of service for the price you pay. Plus South End in general has grown up a lot since the inception of this place and I feel like they need to grow up with the area too. Someone mentioned brunch was dead on a Sunday at 10am and that should be prime time for this place. That statement alone speaks volumes. Parking is also a pain at this place as a side note. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great small restaurant with great service. I got a house coffee (great- a little \"weak\" for my taste but you could tell the beans were freshly roasted and ground- it was a great, complex cup of coffee). 

My breakfast was an apple streusel crepe which was amazing- sweet, buttery, and cinnamony. My husband got the egg/veggie/cheese crepe. I actually liked his better for a meal, because by the end of mine I was on a sugar high. Both used high quality ingredients throughout! I think in the future, my husband and I could split a sweet and a savory instead of getting separate meals. 

Expensive compared to what we usually pay for breakfast ($40 after tip) but I don't mind paying extra for quality. Large portions. Neither of us could finish. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to the historic south end of Charlotte near the Dilworth neighborhood to Crispy Crepe. 

Dora here. Hey, I recognize that cute guy in the red shirt! :)
I would've preferred to sit outside, but the Saturday afternoon of our visit was a scorching 95 degrees. The interior was cozy and air conditioned. Check out that giant bottle of chocolate syrup along the wall. How cool is that? 

This unique eatery not only serves crepes, but also waffles, salads, flatbreads and sandwiches. 

I chose the Egg n Turkey Bacon Waffle which is served with two eggs, turkey bacon and fresh fruit. Now this waffle is not an ordinary waffle. It is a Liege waffle, named after a city in Belgium, and is made using brioche style dough and caramelized Belgian sugar, and pressed in a cast iron press. 

This waffle was outstanding, definitely the highlight of the dish, and reminds me of waffles from our trips to Europe. The soft scrambled, not runny eggs and bacon were perfectly cooked. 

Dora here. Isn't that plate huge? I couldn't let Ernie eat that whole meal by himself!  He definitely needed help with the waffle. Wow! Yeasty and yummy and my fork kept sneaking over to his plate. :)

I strategized my order. I knew we were going for a sweet crepe, so I ordered the Smoked Turkey with White Stilten Cranberry Cheese sandwich. Doesn't that sound intriguing? I know, right? And look at it. Sweet caramelized onions, cranberry cheese...need I say more? Yummo! And to be fair, I did share. :)

The Chocolate Peanut Butter crepe was filled with mini chocolate peanut butter cups, vanilla cream & drizzled with caramel. The chocolate and cream, almost like a donut cream, all mingled together for a sweet ending to a great meal. Check this out!

Dora here. The crepes don't normally come split like this. Somebody was a bit too quick with the knife. Lucky I snapped a picture because this crepe vanished within seconds.

The coffee was a different story. Too weak for me. Bummer. 

Three hours of free parking is available in a garage around the corner. Service was a bit slow because of the packed restaurant, but you won't need that long to eat. :)

We rate this restaurant 4 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving great food.

{"text":"Parking was difficult. Really liked my crepe, but others at the table didn't have the same experience. I won't be back soon unless it's for takeout -- the ventilation in the restaurant was horrible and the cook is very close to patrons, so fumes from cooking hung in the air (and my clothes) and left me with a headache."}
{"text":"The Crispy Crepe is fantastic! I had the Chipotle Chicken Crepe and was blown away. Add a little hot sauce on it and now you're talking! The fresh salad as a side is definitely the way to go, although the fruit looked really good.

Why not 4 or 5 stars? 
         Parking is kind of a bugger, park behind CC in the parking deck, limited spaces available to the public.
          The CC is crazy busy on the weekends so be prepared to wait.
           And lastly, the coffee sucked. But I'm a coffee nerd."}
{"text":"Groupon had round 2 of coupons for Crispy Crepe, so I decided to give them another try after a so-so first visit.

Well, round 2 was just not much better, but an improvement.

First big difference was that it wasn't the same, order and pay at the counter and we'll bring it to you sort of thing. This time, we were seated and had a server order our food and bring us our check, etc. This was definitely more relaxing. 

This time they also had their patio poppin'. We ate outside at like 7:30 on a Thursday in July, the weather and ambiance was perfect.

I tried the Crispy Cheese crepe this time. Unfortunately it just tasted like a cheese quesidilla. It wasn't bad, just boring and lacking in texture. The menu says it's served with a grape tomato relish, but it really was just a couple sliced grape tomatoes with a vinaigrette. I got the black bean and corn salsa-like salad as my side... not good, not bad. 

My boyfriend on the other hand, LOVED his crepe this time around. He ordered the Chipotle Chicken Crepe and was all about that thing. He ate every single bite and would totally order it again. 

So, we'll definitely be back so my boyfriend can order the Chipotle Chicken Crepe again and I will still be on a quest to find a decent vegetarian crepe option here."}
{"text":"Hubs and I had the cinnamon waffle and fresh fruit crepe. Absolutely amazing! Top off with the creme Brule latte....time for a nap!"}
{"text":"The crepes and waffles are delicious! It can get a little pricey with upcharges, but the food is worth it. The cookie butter crepe is my personal favorite. The crepes are always fresh and light. The service is average, doesn't take too long to get food. Overall a great place for a breakfast splurge."}
{"text":"There are many places that are much better than, Crispy Crepe. Also, places where the staff and owner won't tell you that you don't fit in, due to your appearance. Living close by my friend and I decided to give it a try. I take it that most of their clientele isn't tattooed and pierced. I heard the owner describe me to our server and say, \"this isn't the place for those people with their tattoos\" I hated to break it to them, it's Southend not South Park."}
{"text":"The crepes are huge and amazing!!!!!!!!!!!! Highly recommend for hangover brunch!"}
{"text":"The selection of crepes there is pretty sweet, no pun intended. But they also have some savory crepes as well if that's what your looking for at that time. But I first got the espresso, and that was made as good as any other espresso that I've had, so that is a plus for them. And I choose to have the sweet crepe and got the cheesecake crepe and the only thing that I have against the crepe was that it was extremely tough and had a really hard time eating it. But the filling was rich and decadent ( yeah that was an Anthony Anderson spoof lol). So all in all its not the best crepe I've had but it was good."}
{"text":"Discovered this place in a Buzzfeed list of the best places to grab breakfast in Charlotte. I was not disappointed! 
When we arrived, the place was packed. Even so, we were seated in a little under 30 minutes.
I got the cheese crepe with turkey bacon and my fiancée got the smoked salmon and goat cheese crepe. Both were delicious! 
And the must have of the experience: the cookie butter latte! Do not pass up this treat!
The only reason I didn't give a 5 star rating is the price was a bit high. Even so, we shall return."}
{"text":"Loved this place!!!  We stumbled upon it while out for a walk and decided to pop in for brunch. Couldn't decide between sweet or savory... So we each picked one and shared. Cookie butter waffle was devine as well as the Herb Ricotta Cheese and Spinach crepe. Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Yum!! The food and drinks were amazing! I highly recommend the cookie butter coffee, it was a sweet treat that I've never had anywhere else! The wait was pretty atrocious, which means they are doing well for themselves (soooo, woo hoo) but I wish there was more areas indoors to wait to be seated especially on hot days. 

Service was great, kind of slow because of the number of patrons but I will definitely not fault them on that! I thoroughly enjoyed my experience and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A few weeks ago, I visited the Crispy Crepe for the first time. I ordered the Cinnamon Roll Waffle. Now, in Crispy Crepe's defense, the waitress told me it was super sweet (And I LOVE sweets), but WHOA! It was so sweet and sugary I couldn't even enjoy it. Not a fan of this dish. 

I decided to give this place another shot today (based on its reputation alone) and ordered the vegetarian crepe. The veggie crepe was pretty good. The mushrooms gave the crepe a great texture and was paired nicely with the sautéed spinach and cheese. The potatoes that were served as my side were one of the best parts of my meal. 

I'll probably give this place another shot and try another meal in the future. I really want to like this place, but am not incredibly impressed."}
{"text":"This is my third time visiting crispy crepes and once again the food is amazingly good. 
I had the Smoked Salmon Egg Crepe and my friend had the bacon and egg crepe these are must try items.  

The maple cream pumpkin pie was good and the turkey bacon was great.  
This place is only for those willing to try different types of food and it's not your normal Waffle House type of menu. 

If your looking to try something new this is sure to be hit and you will enjoy CC. 

FYI this is not a place to have a business meeting being that it's extra loud when it's busy."}
{"text":"After spotting Crispy Crepe driving down South Blvd where all the new condos/apartments are, we decided to give it a shot this past Sunday morning.  Being Sunday morning, we were afraid there would be a long wait, but we gave it a shot anyway.  Fortunately, although the restaurant was busy, there was a table for us!  Since it was a beautiful day, it would have been nice to have sat at one of their covered tables on the sidewalk, but they were already all taken (another time then!).  

For being where it is, the restaurant is a decent size, and the interior with the big glass windows and modest decor give it a very cheerful, welcoming, clean feel.    I've never been that crazy about the open kitchen concept, but it wasn't bothersome for breakfast.  I guess I'm just one of those people who'd rather see and feel the ambiance of a dining room (especially when I'm dining OUT) than try to eat a meal in the throes of the kitchen where the chefs and servers are buzzing about.  

Crispy Crepe has a lot of lunch items but not as many breakfast choices as I was hoping, especially with the crepes.  There's only a couple of basic egg options.  So, with the promise of our table sharing one of the many, many dessert crepe choices (dessert for breakfast? yikes!), I went with the Egg 'n' Turkey Bacon Waffle Platter (with au gratin potatoes) so I could taste of variety of items during my first visit.  Everything was delicious.  The potatoes were really creamy and cheesy (not greasy).  I hoped they were fresh instead of from a package, but I couldn't be too sure.  The waffle was definitely a highlight.  It's called a Liège Waffle, which I've never had before.  It was very dense, but full of a lot of flavor that regular waffles don't have.  It stayed very crispy, too, even with the real maple syrup on it.  

At the end of the meal, we all split a Banofie Crêpe, which was a giant crepe filled with bananas and a butterscotch custard.  It tasted similar to Bananas Foster.  The crepe itself was light and delicious.  

Lastly, I must note the coffee.  It tasted good and came in a BIG cup.  I always appreciate restaurants with big coffee cups so I'm not waiting for a server to come around often to keep refilling my tiny cup/mug.  I only had to have one refill this time around (but our super-friendly and efficient server came around a lot anyway).  

Will we be back?  You betcha."}
{"text":"Great crepes...although it needs to open earlier and 7 days a week.  It seems that I have tried to go when it is closed as often as it is open."}
{"text":"I eat out all the time, and I can say without any hesitation, this was the most outstanding dish I've had in months: Bruschetta Crepe with chicken, with a side of fruit... Dessert was: Cookie Butter Waffle, topped with a chocolate covered strawberry. 
There wasn't a single bite of food left on either plates. 
Amazing service, decent atmosphere.. Sensational/fresh food. 
I only wish they were closer to my house, so I could eat Crispy Crepe daily. 
Only downfall: they're not open on Monday's."}
{"text":"The S'mores latte is super yummy. I got the egg and cheddar crepe and it's huge and so worth the stop if you're in town.The au gratin potatoes are soo good!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised that this is the second review since I've already been there 3 times. Oddly, I still haven't tried a dessert crepe!  This new place in SouthEnd next to My Townhome is well located and a good spot to get a meal or a snack.

Our favorite dishes are the chipotle chicken crepe, the eggplant tartine (delish!) and caramelized waffles. The tartine came with a melange of roasted veggies including more eggplant that was awesome and I think I would like to have that as the side with everything (even though the orzo salad was great too). My friend enjoyed her portobello grilled cheese panini. The lemon peppered chicken crepe left a bit to be desired, and I wish that they had a creamy chicken and mushroom one like the delicious ones at Cafe Monte, or a shrimp artichoke one. 

They make crepes on site in front of you so it actually is a bit smoky in there, so they need to keep the door open or figure out the ventilation a bit better.  They didn't do too much with the upfit, so I think they could get a little more creative to make it feel more cozy.  But I look forward to returning and trying the salads and dessert crepes or chocolate dipped strawberries!"}
{"text":"They need to change their name to soggy crepe. The only reason they're getting 2 stars is that the filling of the maple \"crisp\" (not crispy) cheesecake crepe was tasty.  
Even the coffee was watered down and ill-prepared. Save your money."}
{"text":"It was crowded as expected for a Saturday morning the wait wasn't too bad.  Once we were seated and ordered our food came out quick. Our server was nice and provided the special for the day, she wasn't pushy but observant and the place was crowded. I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great service, atmosphere, and delicious food! 
Fresh perfection! I love that they offer a buckwheat option."}
{"text":"Charlotte is not a big crepe city so if you're looking for something unique in concept, give it a shot. Food's good - def a crowd (and a wait) on your typical weekend brunch times like Sun 10-1. 

Very laid back place to have a coffee and grab a crepe - as a meal, dessert, or just for fun."}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch and all had crepes, smoked salmon and vegetarian. They were excellent, as were the lattes. A Quebec lady in our group was pleasantly surprised to find maple syrup latte on the menu. The place was full and some people were eating on the outside terrace. The owner was cooking and supervising the open kitchen, always a good sign. I had the salad greens and absolutely loved the dressing, Portions were generous, we all loved this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The Cookie Butter Latte is phenomenal. If you don't try anything else- try this. My friend had the veggie egg cheddar Crepe which was super awesome. I had the fruit medley Crepe. We also split the cinnamon roll crepe- which was the best! 

The service was great! Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I'm actually surprised reviews aren't higher for this place. My husband and I had a great experience. We were there on a beautiful Saturday, right before the brunch busy time, however we got seated on the patio pretty quickly! Service was quick and the food was good. 

Per usual, I was so indecisive and had trouble deciding between a savory or sweet crepe. But alas, my sweet tooth always wins out and I got the cookie butter waffle and added strawberries! They were a nice touch, but be careful because it adds like $2.00! The waiter offered, so I agreed to add them. Be careful of those trickster \"add ons.\" The hubs made me feel glutenous by ordering the healthy egg and veggie cheddar crepe. However, it was definitely nice to have a choice between sweet and savory. His was delicious, and the veggies give the color quite a pop!"}
{"text":"I really like crispy crepe. The savory crepes are the best thing on the menu. They are very balanced. The sweet crepes are also good but it's pretty rare when I have a sweet tooth. The staff is always friendly and professional. The only thing that keep me from giving them five stars is that it's very smoky inside. After you've been seated for a while, it's get to the point that your eyes start burning. You can see a layer of smoke in the room. I'm not sure why they don't install better ventilation or keep either the front or back door open so the smoke can escape. Overall great for brunch but be sure to sit as far from the grille as possible or you will find yourself crying over you brunch."}
{"text":"I ordered the egg and waffle combo with au gratin potatoes and 2 pieces of turkey bacon. Au gratin potatoes were below average.. Waffle was super tough, very \"bready\" eggs were just ok, bacon was the only tasty thing on my plate. I regret not ordering a crepe, but will not be returning. Service was decent."}
{"text":"I visited Crispy Crepe for breakfast a couple of months ago. The food was good and the coffee was delicious! Our waitress was friendly and attentive. 

I came back this weekend for an after dinner treat. The waitress was obviously anxious to leave which made the experience very rushed and uncomfortable. The cookie butter crepe was good, but the coffee was just as cold as the ice water. 

Probably will not be coming back! #LivyOut"}
{"text":"Wowwwwwwwww. I'm not sure how I've waiting almost two years after living in South End to try this place out. It's definitely one of my go-to brunch spots going forward. 

The caffe mocha was awesome, a great way to start your morning. 

Crepe wise, my wife & I split it chipotle chicken & the picorini (think Cesar salad) crepes. Both were delicious and I'd easily recommend them. The cheesy potato side great flavor & texture, and the side salad was probably the best \"side\" salad I've had at any restaurant. Their house dressing was almost like a pesto, and it was fantastic. 

I cannot wait to head back to this joint and try one of their authentic Belgian waffles."}
{"text":"The crêpes were amazing! I have been looking for a place that serves gluten free crêpes for a long time... The ones served here are wonderful! I got the scrambled egg and turkey bacon GF crêpe and my husband got the chipotle chicken crêpe. He says his was delicious and I know mine was! And then for dessert we had Nutella with strawberries and this is a testament to how wonderful the GF crêpes were we shared a GF crêpe! 
Kayla, our server, was friendly and gave good advice on what to eat. 
Only complaint was the temperature of the restaurant which did not affect the flavor of the food or our service. The restaurant felt like it was 80 degrees! 
We will be back! But maybe fix the AC please and thank you!"}
{"text":"First, let me say that we entered the restaurant, but ended up not eating here for a couple of reasons.

We were passing through Charlotte on the way back to Asheville and were looking for a gluten-free option for food, before we hit the highway. We found Crispy Crepe through a Google search and Yelp directed us to their contact information and profile page on the Yelp website.

We called the restaurant to make sure they were still open. They were, as they close at 5 pm on Sundays. We made our way there, found parking, and proceeded to enter. It was before 5 pm, but the staff were already cleaning up, having mopped the floor with a strong cleaner, while people were still eating. It's my opinion that it is rude to mop a floor while people are eating. You impact the food smell, which is one aspect of the overall experience.

My wife is very sensitive to toxic chemicals, so we decided we'd do take out instead of dining in. When we stepped to the register, my wife asked about gluten-free options. The cashier had zero knowledge of what was gluten-free on the menu and what was not. She turned around to ask the person making the crepes and he was unsure if the sauce on one of the menu items contained gluten. It was clear that both employees lacked the knowledge or understanding of whether or not one of the crepes contained gluten.

From cleaning the restaurant with toxic chemicals (many restaurants are using green cleaners now) to having a passing interest in understanding their own menu, I was very disappointed with my first experience at Crispy Crepe. Fortunately, I live in Asheville, where they take these things seriously, instead of Charlotte, where it seems like there is little regard for people with both chemical and gluten sensitivities.

We ended up simply heading to Whole Foods to eat off the hot bar, because at least they list their ingredients and they don't clean around the food when you're trying to enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"Well, we enjoyed an early lunch here and were glad to have beaten the rush. Folks were piling in after we had ordered. We thought that this was a good sign. We both had savory dishes with-- the Chipotle Chicken being really tasty. Per the menu it consists of \"Cumin crusted chicken slices topped with pico de gallo, jack cheese, sliced avocado & chipotle cream\" and comes with a side orzo pasta salad.  All of these ingredients worked well together and tasted fresh.  I also tried a Caramel Macchiato. Although I could taste the caramel and hints of vanilla, I will ask for maybe an extra shot of espresso. It was a little weak for my tastes. Service was decent and the owners seemed nice and asked if all was good. Prices are moderate. We will have to come back and try some of the sweeter choices."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Service was poor.  Hostess and waitstaff were not very friendly nor helpful. Warm soda with three ice cubes (had to ask for more ice), the server was thrown off by a simple question (\"how's your hummus?\"), and we were given our correct bill and somehow when we got the card back to sign, it was the wrong amount.  Server and manager handled it really poorly and seemed inconvenienced by the request to make it right.  Not even an apology.  I would go back for the food, but not the experience."}
{"text":"Delicious food, made fresh and fast. Attentive and considerate staff. This restaurant is consistent every time we have come!"}
{"text":"The wife and I have now been here on several occasions and the food and service has always been great. The crepes are huge and tasty with plenty of filling whether they be sweet or savory. 

Overall, we have tried the vegetarian, smoked salmon, chipotle chicken and shrimp  crepes, and they are all great. The crepes all come with sides and the daily salad has easily been the best with variations on tabbouleh and chick pea salad. My only gripe is the kettle chips as a side, which were really just regular potato chips from a bag, and not even kettle chips. Also, last time I took a shawarma lamb sandwich, which was a good change of pace, but I would be hard pressed to say that is was better than the crepes.

For the dessert we usually take a waffle and our favorite is the maple delight, but the banana butterscotch is a close second. The lattes and espresso here is also pretty good if you need a little caffeine pick me up. We shall return often."}
{"text":"This place is a must if you are in South End for breakfast or an early lunch. Their savory crepes are super yummy."}
{"text":"This is my favorite weekend breakfast location. The crepes are so delicious, and we love sitting outside on the patio to eat. The coffee and specialty drinks are also amazing. Service has always been very efficient. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Crispy Crepe is easily one of the best places in Charlotte for Sunday Brunch. Always great food, service and presentation. HOWEVER! Until they fix the ventilation, don't even consider sitting inside. Pray the weather is nice and choose the patio. Had a great meal today, but was chased out by thick smoke that burned eyes and left clothing smelling like we'd just worked the grill. With an efficient ventilation system, Crispy Crepe would be an easy 5 Stars."}
{"text":"Tasty food, very nice interior, good service. great side walk seating and people watching."}
{"text":"I accidentally wrote my review in the check-in -_- 3/26/17 was my 3rd visit. I love this place. Their crepes are huge and I'm always satisfied, the side of potatoes is great as well. My favorite savory crepe is the egg and veggie with cheddar cheese. This last time I had them use herbed goat cheese instead...I now have a new favorite. My companion ordered the smoked salmon with goat cheese, I'm getting that one next time. The staff here are equally amazing."}
{"text":"Had heard some good things about this place and was excited to check it out. I'm not the biggest fan of crepes, but thought it was cool that another creperie was opening in town. 

Located on South Blvd, the parking can be a little hairy. You'll have to grab a meter or score a spot in one of the close garages. Not my ideal situation, but it's pretty cool that it's right off of the street. There is some outdoor seating with umbrellas which are nice, too. Always great to see the hustle and bustle on South during the day. The interior is pretty spacious. Plenty of tables and a small lounge area with some comfy chairs. Tons of natural light coming in their large windows, too. Very welcoming. 

The open kitchen is a HUGE plus, too. Always fun to watch someone make crepes. Great for kids. 

I had no idea when the menu held, so I went with the first sweet crepe on the menu. Maple Cream. This is where these guys lost it for me. It was a pretty standard crepe. Some whipped cream and fruit on the side. But....filled what was the equivalent of low-grade paper canister icing that you find in the grocery store. The worst part? There was SO MUCH of it. It was so overpoweringly sweet that I had to discard almost all of it for it to be slightly enjoyable. Really disappointing. Though, I think some of their savory crepes would be more enjoyable. Hoping to check those out next time. 

I can't say I'll be rushing back it anytime soon, but these guys have a pretty cool setup. Really dig the open kitchen and think some of their concoctions are cool. Worth a shot, in my opinion. Just ask for LESS maple cream, should you venture down that road."}
{"text":"Went in today for breakfast and there was no wait. It smelled amazing inside and I couldn't wait to order. Our server, Shana, was attentive and sweet and very prompt. I ordered the apple streusel crepe, which was bigger than I thought it would be, and SO tasty. My husband got a savory salmon crepe and said it was excellent. I also ordered one of the tastiest chai lattes ever. I definitely want to come back."}
{"text":"So good I forgot to take the pic before I ate it. Portion to price is great. The fruit was perfect and fresh. The service was excellent. Thank u for a great Sunday morning."}
{"text":"The food and service are fine. However, the smoke from kitchen is floating around the whole restaurant, which makes me feel terrible. They definitely need to improve the ventilation system inside the room, otherwise, I will never recommend people should come here for food"}
{"text":"Wow oh wow oh wow. These crepes are to die for! I always enjoy a sweet one when I decide to get crepes cause you basically get dessert for breakfast and who doesn't love that? I got the apple streusel and it tasted like a warm little apple pie wrapped up in a crepe. SO GOOD. My friend got the cookie butter crepe and the bananas perfectly compliment the cookie butter as not to make it too too sweet. My boyfriend ended up with the chipotle chicken crepe as it was pretty close to lunch at this point. As someone who was skeptical about crepes and had actually never had one, he loved It and was excited to eat his leftovers later that day. 

The service was really quick! We were quoted half an hour wait for 3 people but only waited about 15. After we ordered, our food took maybe 10 minutes to receive and not much longer to devour! I would most definitely come here again for breakfast/brunch!"}
{"text":"They have hands down the best crepes I have ever had! I got the Bruschetta Crepe and added chicken and it was amazing! The flavors were so developed, the crepe was thin, everything was perfect. I got a side of Au Gratin potatoes and they were delicious, not too overwhelmingly cheesy! I also ordered a Fresh Fruit Medley Crepe and it was really good too. I don't have a huge sweet tooth, but I liked it! The sweetness was not too overpowering and the whipped cream definitely helped soothe it a bit. The decor is so adorable and chic, I love it. Our waitress was so nice and even wrote \"Thanks\" on the receipt. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So, I really hesitated about the appropriate number of stars for this place. I wish I could give 4.5. I mean, in the category of casual eateries, it probably deserves 5 stars, but compared to all restaurants I've been to ever in my life, 4 seems more appropriate. Moving on--the food. We hesitated to try the Crispy Crepe due to the lukewarm reviews, but I am sure glad we stopped in tonight. Our server was great and helpful (not to mention right on target) with menu selections. We had the Mediterranean, Apple Brie, and Bruschetta crepes for our meal along with fruit and the salad of the day (rice and asparagus). It was all delicious. The crepes themselves were just right, crispy edges, mmmm. I read another review that described both the Mediterranean and Apple Brie crepes as bland. They must have changed something since that review. All of the crepes were flavorful and amazing fresh from the kitchen. The Bruschetta crepe suffers a bit from sitting around (I nibbled the leftovers from the plate of one of my kids, and it was not as good as it was right at first), so it might not be a good choice for takeout. The combination of the brie and apples is tasty (not too sweet). The pesto on the Bruschetta crepe is so yummy and delicious. The Mediterranean manages to capture all those flavors you expect in that kind of crepe, the saltiness of the olives and tanginess of the vinaigrette. The spinach was clearly fresh too. All in all, they were delicious. The kiddos ate them up too. We tried an old standby for dessert, the banana and Nutella crepe. You just can't go wrong and Crispy Crepe does it right. It was very good. I'd say it was better than that other option in town for crepes and way way cheaper. For $35 we were stuffed! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Butter cookie latte could put Starbucks out of business it was that good, and if you leave hungry, you're a BIG eater."}
{"text":"Such a cute place.   Small bistro seating about 40-50 people. They have a large selection of savory and sweet crepes along with other items.  I had the bruschetta crepe with chicken.  It was large, way to large for one person and it comes with a side.  I choose the salad.   Perfect little salad.   The crepe was very tasty but had to much of the pesto oil.   If you choose this maybe tell them light on pesto.   You can always add more."}
{"text":"This place is breakfast/brunch nirvana. Pick between a wide range of sweet or savory crepes. As well as my favorite brunch item, the schwarma lamb pita wrap. I can taste it in my dreams. Last time I went I also tried the smoked salmon crepe which was life changing. Only downside to this place is it's only open til 3pm! On street parking only."}
{"text":"Sweet treats abound at Crispy Crepe. In addition to the crepes, they have liege waffles and creative coffee drinks. For those who arent aware, a liege waffle is different and much better than a normal waffle. These belgian style waffles are filled with pearl sugar that caramelizes when cooked. Theyre more like desserts than breakfast dishes. My favorite crepe is the fresh fruit medley which is filled with strawberries, bananas, and honeydews then topped with a dulce de leche sauce. The menu description says that is also includes kiwis but I have never seen a kiwi in this crepe and Ive ordered it several times-I wish theyd actually start putting them in. One of my only complaints about Crispy Crepe is that their menu descriptions are also inaccurate. The bananofie crepe is good but I was a little peeved about the misleading menu description. This crepe is supposed to be filled with bananas and a butterscotch custard. I love custards so I was a bit dismayed when my crepe arrived and was topped with a butterscotch sauce instead of a custard-not the same thing! It was still very tasty but I think it would be even better with a real custard. Ive never had a chance to order the coffee drinks because its hard for me to drink a sugary drink while also eating a sweet dish but one day, Ill have to come in to get coffee and nothing else. The butter cookie latte sounds intriguing. Overall, very good but beware of the fact that what you order may not match the description exactly!"}
{"text":"Great location the food is exceptional and as fresh as it gets. Anyone that eats there must try the Chipotle Chicken each bite is like a bit of paradise. The service from start to finish was first class, I promise to be a great experience that will have you returning for more."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday afternoon and was immediately seated. I ordered the apple and brie crepe-- my first time trying a savory crepe. The food was delicious, nice serving sizes, and friendly waitress. I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"I'm not a crepe expert but I'm sold. I went in expecting to find a bunch of sweet crepes but was completely caught off guard with all the non-sweet crepes on the menu. 
I ordered the chocolate Nutella crepe with bananas, and I am a chocolate lover. I ashamed to say there was just too much chocolate! Lets not talk about that ever again. 
The crepe came with an awesome side of pineapple & chocolate covered strawberry. 
I need to go back and try a savory crepe!"}
{"text":"Unfortunate experience, very poor customer service, above all... Not dog friendly. Waitress had to be reminded multiple times to bring silverware, to refill our water glasses and no dog bowls for our puppy."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food and great service! They never disappoint. I recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and awesome food.

The waitress was REALLY off (slow, distracted, taking smoke breaks) but not bad enough to spoil a great lunch.

We will be back!!!

PS- They seemed to have quite a few fruit flies/gnats also.  :-/"}
{"text":"My first visit.  Parking is in parking garage.  Small place, but nice and quaint.  Ate outside due to not enough umbrellas the sun beat down on us pretty hot.   Took 10 mins for waitress to take order.  35 mins. For food to come.  The food was worth the wait. We had the apple strudel crepe and the turkey bacon and egg crepe.   All in all a very nice brunch."}
{"text":"Sooooo... I didn't order a crepe but the waffle is more than likely just as good as them. It's sweet but not too sweet with the German sugar... Towards the end it did start to taste a little too sweet. Maybe it's because of the White Hot Chocolate... Which might I add was REALLY GOOD!!! Not too hot, just right. Creamy, buttery flavor. Definitely better than the White Hot Chocolate from Starbucks. 

Anyway, the potatoes au gratin is aaaawwwesommmme!!!!  And the turkey bacon is on point. Not like that fake stuff you buy in the store. I really would have been good with the bacon, potatoes, and hot chocolate. 

My eggs weren't really cooked right, but in light of the other parts of my dish... I could ignore the eggs. 

Nice spot for some brunch.

I think I'll try a crepe next time. Savory or sweet? Who knows?"}
{"text":"I love crepes and this place does them VERY well. Good choice of savory and dessert crepes with good, bold house coffee. We're huge fans of brunch - who isn't - and this is one of our go-tos. Oh and very family-friendly with a good amount of parking in the back."}
{"text":"First time here and was with my nephew and his friends for about after church meal in Easter. Apparently,  we were there at the right time. First thing that caught by eyes was the service Nicole was our server...knowledgeable and really listened to ensure that my omelet was as I wanted it. W. Food presentation awesome as was the taste. My nephew stated u hit a home run.  I felt so as well.  Will be back. Thanks Nicole for making our dunning experience a great one."}
{"text":"Went here for easter brunch. There is a parking deck which is really nice since parking is sometimes hard to find in south end. They have a good amount of seating and there is patio seating as well. We were immediately seated and we ordered a cookie butter latte and an Americano. The cookie butter latte was SO good. Way better than anything Starbucks has to offer. For brunch, I ordered the chipotle chicken crepe with the Au gratin potatoes. The crepe was really good, the best crepe I've had in the charlotte area. It was more than enough food for me and I actually couldn't finish it all. Can't wait to go back and try some of the sweet crepes!"}
{"text":"First off- I love crepes. Breakfast, dinner- whatever. My husband and I decided to check it out a few days ago for dinner....DELISH!!! This place gives the Crepe Cellar a run for its money. Plus, you have a ton more crepe options than other local places and their lattes are out of this world (what a great combo). The portion is pretty large- I had to take my crepe home and it was even just as good for the following day. I ordered the chicken bruschetta crepe with the scalloped potatoes. Melt in your mouth crepe, which was crusted in garlic and cheese. I started off with some French onion soup as did my husband- a great starter. We finished off with a Nutella and strawberry crepe with a cookie butter latte- all I can say is it.was.awesome. 
Our server was also extremely attentive and offered some really good recommendations as we had not been there before. This is going to be my new crepe place to go."}
{"text":"Was heading towards Carrabba's for Lunch and my friend noticed several patrons sitting outside the patio and wanted to check out this cafe.

This is a very spacious eatery. Once you walk it, the staff noted you can sit anywhere you like. We wanted to be by the open kitchen to see how they prepare the crepes and waffles.

We ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Crepe and the Grilled Marinated Shrimp Crepe. Bother crepes was delicious. Large portions and perfect size for brunch, lunch or dinner. They did not have salmon crepes which was my favorite.

There were refills for coffee and tea. Staff checked to see if we wanted refills and water.

For those allergic to certain food make sure staff knows. My friend is allergic to onions and told waiter to remove out of crepe which they forgot when the crepe was brought out. Informed waiter again and they took care of it right away.

Will be back to try the sweet crepes the next time I am in the neighborhood.

As you walk out the door look out for bowl of water for the dog. Almost stepped into it.

Metered parking outside of the restaurant. Whole street on South Blvd is metered parking. Make sure you have coins available."}
{"text":"Crispy Crepe has a lot to offer.  This is a staple back-up breakfast place for us for a long time.  The location is great, right in south end outside of uptown.  The restaurant is not huge, but they do have (dog-friendly) outside seating which is nice.

The food is consistently good. They have a lot of options and an expansive drink list which is always fun.

Unfortunately the last time we were there we had a waitress who put a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended), so I'm compelled to keep my review short to be fair the the restaurant.  CC is great, this waitress was terrible.  Not a review for yelp.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Love their Mediterranean wrap (not sure of the right name). Crepès are great and they always give chocolate dipped strawberry with fresh whipped cream with Crepès. Awesome."}
{"text":"The first time I tried this place out, the service was S - L - O - W. They were understaffed that night but the place had no more than 10 customers so it shouldn't have been an issue. A good time to go is during lunch, surprisingly. There isn't much of a crowd. I am a fan of the bruchetta crepe. It's got a lot of flavor and texture and is very filling. My favorite is the roasted eggplant flatbread. It's served like a pizza pie, big enough to share for two. Packed with so much flavor it'll rock your senses. I'm already craving it as I type this out. Definitely don't leave without trying a dessert crepe. Can't go wrong with any of them but anything Nutella always hits the spot. They also offer gluten-free crepes, so that's a plus for those seeking that option. Oh, and, try to be seated as far away from the kitchen area as possible or you'll walk out smelling like grease."}
{"text":"Crispy Crepe is SUPER yummy! I am not a huge fan of crepes, but the Cannoli crepe was amazing.  My only beef-- the place is open to the kitchen, which is nice; however, there does not seem to be much ventilation.  My suggestion, sit outside.

P.S. - They also have really good coffee!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have probably been to Crispy Crepe over 10 times.  They see us coming and greet us with \"welcome back\"  at this point.  I have tried quite a few menu items but the Cookie Butter Waffle is my favorite.  The waffles have a yeast flavor (not our American type waffles.. read about the caramelizing pearl sugar, non-bromated flour, etc. on the CC site).  It is served with the Biscoff European Cookie Butter, whipped cream, bananas, and topped with a chocolate covered strawberry.  :)  It is just big enough to leave me satisfied, but not stuffed!  The waffles are not huge, but are thick, Belgian-style.

The Bruschetta (add chicken) or Caesar Crepe (I forget the actual name) are both wonderful.  My husband enjoys the eggs, turkey bacon, waffle and gratin potato dish, but does wish they offered regular bacon. (Not turkey bacon fans). He also enjoys their sandwiches.  My vegetarian son loves a lot of their dishes, crepes, and coffees.

The owner is very nice and on Mother's Day (after eating a large lunch at Cowfish) I wanted a Cookie Butter Waffle that evening.  They treated us like royalty and even brought me out a flower for Mother's Day (my second of the day).  I thought that was very considerate.  The interior is very European (reminds me a lot of Cafe Monte in SouthPark, if you have been there.. very French).  Outside patio seating is available.  Parking is in the rear in a HUGE (free) garage for those of you who are having a problem with that.

We had one slow waiter experience, which we over looked since they were in training, and one take out apple/brie crepe that was not so hot.. (eat these crepes while they ARE crispy)... not so hot for take out, as they do lose their crispness in a take out container.

I have never minded the kitchen (it is glassed off from the main dining area & I enjoy seeing them at work), and our food is always hot from a heating lamp they use to keep the entire meal hot while getting it ready to bring to the table at one time.  

I have not yet tried the salads, but they look fantastic.  They do gluten-free dishes, also.  While I usually eat gluten free, I have found I can eat these waffle with the non-bromated flour without problems.  I will definitely be continuing to visit Crispy Crepe for my Cookie Butter Waffle fix! :)"}
{"text":"Fun different types of crepes the bruschetta and cookie butter crepes were so good and the lattes are beautiful. Worth the wait"}
{"text":"I got a flat bread but it was more of a salad with mushy bread.  I wish I would have skipped straight to dessert & only gotten the sweet crepe.  I had the apple crepe and it was wonderful."}
{"text":"OK, I've been here a handful of times and I think it's ready to give the Crispy Crepe my honest review: It's as good as everyone says it is!

Personally, I think it's one of the best crepe spots in Charlotte. It's usually busy on the weekends so make sure you get here early or you will wait. However, I've noticed they always tell me it's a longer wait than it really is. Last time the wait was \"45 minutes\", but we only waited 20. 

Anyways- to the good stuff:

Chipotle Crepe (Chicken, Pico de Gallo, cheese,avocado & chipotle cream): You can't go wrong with chipotle. It's got a little kick to it, but nothing too over powering. If you're not a fan of spice, ask for a side of extra sour cream with it and definitely extra pico! 

Spinach Goat Cheese Crepe (Ricotta cheese with sundried tomatoes, cheese, spinach & roasted red pepper pesto): First of all, add chicken. It's bangin! You can also add chicken to any veggie crepe for a slight up-charge. This crepe is the bomb.com and one of my favorite savory crepes. So delicious! 

Pecorino Chicken (chicken, romaine, parmesan & creamy caesar dressing): Basically it's like a chicken ceaser salad wrapped in a crepe and it's delicious! But it's also really big so come hungry! 

Waffles: Pretty good- super dense and a little aggressive if you eat it yourself. You might be in a sugar or chocolate coma after it so think about splitting it with someone else first. I had the Cookie Butter one and was in heaven while eating it.

For sides, the salad is good and I love their dressing - a creamy pesto basil dressing (?). The potatoes are also a must! They are so cheesy and delicious. 

For the 2 pairs out there- do yourself a favor and order one crepe and one waffle or one savory crepe and one dessert crepe. Get the best of both worlds. Plus, the servers are happy to bring you an extra plate if you share."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. I went Friday morning, it was no waiting line, we got nice table close to the window. The service was friendly. I loved the crepes!!! My was with cheesecake filling, and it was very sweet, as for me, but I combined it with my husband's crepe with chicken as the result I was happy. Nice place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Mediocre restaurant at best, but if you plan on visiting any of their neighboring business and you parked in their designated spots (even after they're closed) your car is probably going to get towed. Also, while on the phone asking about the where abouts of my car (no signs saying who to call) the manager proceeded the tell the girl who answered the phone, 'if anyone asks the speak to the manager tell them I'm not here'. Great look guy, wont be coming back here any time soon, and I'll make sure none of my friends do :)"}
{"text":"Crispy crepe is one of those places that becomes a fantastic addition to your regularly visited collection of eateries. It has everything on the menu from savory and sweet crepe entries as well as options for your gluten free and vegan friends. 

I recently visited with just such a group where we had gluten free and vegan requirements and both parties were extremely pleased. I had the chipotle chicken crepe and it was delightful. The portions were very substantial and being a 6'1\" guy with a healthy appetite I was satisfied. 

The staff is very friendly and helpful and the decor is pleasant. The restaurant also features an outdoor patio and a good brunch menu for this sunny afternoon weekends."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went on a Sunday at 10:00am. We figured we would have to wait but surprisingly we sat right down. The server greeting us with water and asked if we wanted anything else to drink. We did not feel rushed and the server gave us time to look over the menu. 

My boyfriend got the strawberry Nutella crepe and I got the Brushetta crepe with potato au gratin and added Chicken for $2.99. 

Our food came out fast (mind you it got really busy when we sat down!) 

The Brushetta was huge! And the Nutella crepe was to die for! 

Overall the service/food was fantastic! We look forward to coming back !"}
{"text":"My cousin and I visited Crispy Crepe and used a Living Social coupon for $20 which covered the entire tab.  This place has changed format since the last time I came.  It used to to be more of a self service and order at the register type place but now it appears to be full service and sit down.

We ordered two crepes - one sweet and one savory and split the two which was absolutely perfect portions and flavors.  The Mediterranean crepe is like a Greek salad with chicken in a crepe and was very tasty and an interesting blend of flavors.  The Bonafie crepe was absolutely amazing with butterscotch and bananas.  Every bite was just the perfect amount of sweet and crispy and so tasty. 

The service was attentive and prompt.  Using the Living Social coupon ($10 for $20) and leaving a $5 tip was an incredible deal of $15 total for two adults to eat some excellent food with great service.  I would highly recommend this place especially if you can each get a sweet and savory crepe and split them.

The parking is past the restaurant down at the bottom of the building in the garage.  It may be a little tricky if you've never been to that building before but it's still a very short walk to the restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! I went during a weekend and it was busy but it was worth the wait. The service was great too!
 
I ordered the butter cream crepe and the creme brûlée latte! It was all delicious!"}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise. First day in Charlotte on a multi-day visit and was looking for something good for breakfast. I went out on a limb and gave a Crispy Crepe a try even though seeing it had a 3-star Yelp rating. My experience was great overall. It's worth mentioning that I visited at a time when they were nowhere close to being busy. It was a weekday (Thursday?) morning around 10:30am. The place was basically empty and service was PROMPT!  We chose to sit outside as the weather was very cooperative.  I ordered the Egg 'n' Turkey Bacon Waffle platter but paid a $4 upcharge to make it a cookie butter waffle. I really wanted to grab a crepe from here too (because it's part of their name!), but couldn't justify adding another $12 to my tab when I was already going to be full from the other stuff. Anyhow, the food was it to me within 5-10 minutes of me ordering. And it looked exactly as picture on the menu!  Since when does that happen?!?!  Cheese & eggs scrambled well, hash brown casserole, turkey bacon, and of course the waffle. I think the attached picture just about says it all, but everything was done to perfection. Eggs were a little small on the portion size but they were good. Next was the hashbrown casserole that had cheese in it. Besides needing a little salt, it was awesome! Turkey bacon was thick cut and full of flavor. And the dough-based waffle was very much dessert for my breakfast. It was larger than expected and the texture was great. I'm not a big fan of whip cream so I could've done without that and I don't eat strawberries so I gave away the chocolate-dipped strawberry that was on top. But the food here was as good as I could ask for. The waitress was friendly and helpful in helping my decide what to get. They are not \"cheap\" but as long as you come in knowing that, you won't be surprised/disappointed by pricing. I checked the menu online before dropping in. There was free 3hr garage parking in the back (no validation required) for restaurant customers. Would highly recommend to anyone without hesitating. Good job Crispy Crepe, good job!"}
{"text":"So In-Love with this place small nice and cozy! My sister, son and I arrived at noon for lunch during the week, we were promptly seated and our waitress arrived right after.
Food was Great... I ordered Chicken Chipotle Crepe & a S'mores Latte... The best latte I've had!!! 
Great customer service & Great Food!!! 
Definitely coming back to Crispy Crepe & try new items on their menu."}
{"text":"My partner and I went there for brunch over a weekend. When we were sat the restaurant was only about half full. The tables around us were being served but no server helped us for about 15 minutes. When we were were finally approached by a waitress she told us \" I didn't see you, you should've waived your hands to signal me.\"

I ordered a \"House Specialty\" the waffle and egg combination... my partner ordered a side of hummus... both where very bland and tasteless, so we stopped eating after a few bites. I noticed several others around us that only ate a few bites as well.

The server asked us how everything was, we told her that it was bland ... she then said \"Don't blame me, I don't make it!\" She then came back with the full bill and we then asked to speak to the manager. He then came over and we told him the story and he ended up comping our meal, with the waitress yelling as we walked out."}
{"text":"This was a nice experience.  I thought the service was great, and I liked the open kitchen.  I tried two crepes, the nutella&banana and brie&apple.  My side item was the au gratin potatoes.  I thought the food was slightly above average, but not great.  All in all it was very nice and I'll return to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Overall I had a good experience at this establishment. I got the cookie butter crepe which was a bit soggy but still good! The decor was quaint, and our waitress was friendly. I liked how there were plenty of options for both sweet and savory, I would come back but I will say I have had better crepes!"}
{"text":"We went there on New Year's Day and it was crazy busy.  First time there.  The owner and the wait staff were EXTREMELY friendly!  The food was hand made and very good.  The side of fruit included strawberries and pineapple...not like most restaurants that give you mostly melon.  This really impressed me!  The atmosphere was also great!  However, it is a little pricey.  We will return :)"}
{"text":"Response to Said G of crispy crepe 

Actually your waiter did not state that you guys didn't have ranch. He just said \"the chef left\" and that the person cooking the food wouldn't be able to fulfill my order. I've never had a problem with other restaurants having an issue with either taking the food off of my bill or letting me try something different, I mean none of those options were given to me. Especially if the customer barely touched their food. So that's just terrible customer service because if the customer isn't happy you should try everything to satisfy the customer. Long story short you guys need to take notes from HAZELNUT CREPERIE because they have the best crepes in charlotte & they're not soggy. They consistently have good crepes that are crispy with that being said y'all have poor customer service & the food sucks :) no wonder hazelnut creperie has better reviews than crispy crepe lol"}
{"text":"They have Waffles, Sandwiches and Crepes some Mediterranean influences for sure and I asked for one of the Sandwiches to be made as a Crepe they said \"Sure\"!  Chicken Shawarma with Feta, Red onions and Eggplant marinated in Moroccan Spices, with Tahini lemon Vinaigrette, Served with a side of Couscous???  Everything was Incredibly Fresh!  They were very Busy for 1:30pm (Black Friday) and Incredibly Fast!  They have only been open about a week!

Open Kitchen!!!  You can watch them grilling the food and making the Crepes!

Fantastic Service! Everyone was very Friendly and Efficient!"}
{"text":"The food was good, the service was horrible.  I had the waffle and my boyfriend had a savory crepe.  The service was very lackluster.  We were seated and forgotten about.  No clue where the server went, so we grabbed another waitress in the area.  Go in to wash our hands prior to eating and she was lingering, socializing with coworkers.  The replacement server wasn't much better."}
{"text":"Ended up here after other plans fell through and we are glad we did! We went on a sunny Sunday about noon and only had to wait around 10 minutes for a table. When you walk in you can see the open kitchen and and glass wall that allows customers to see crepes being made. The restaurant feels cozy and perfect for brunch. We enjoyed the ricotta and spinach crepe and the egg, cheddar, and veggie crepe both with buckwheat crepes. I was thrilled to see buckwheat crepes as an option on the menu, as I
loved the savory buckwheat crepes I enjoyed in Paris earlier this year! The crepes were perfectly cooked, the fillings delicious and the portions huge! I look forward to going back to try a sweet crepe as well.

We also both ordered pumpkin chai lattes with soy milk, I found the drink cloyingly sweet and almost unpleasant to drink due to the sweetness. I would go back for a sweet crepe instead."}
{"text":"Great food. Issues with host and seating. Probably would go back with less expectation."}
{"text":"Just OK.

Had lunch here today.  My girlfriend and I were both remarking on how we liked it, until we got the bill.  It was very overpriced.

I got the signature chipotle chicken salad served on flatbread.  It tasted like a gordita from Taco Bell.  That's not to say it was bad, but if I wanted taco bell that's where I would have gone.   The chicken amount was skimpy, but what was there was very flavorful and well cooked.  I just can't get over how similar the flatbread tasted to the Taco Bell entree.  It was very strange, but I did like it.  Anywho.  For dessert I got the cookie butter waffle.  These are dough waffles, not batter waffles - and I've had them done better (see Cast Iron Skillet in South Park), but it was still yummy.  I'll probably ask them to go light on the cookie butter topping next time.  The low light of the meal was the side of au gratin potatoes.  It was not good.  My dinning companion agreed.  I should have listened to my fellow yelpers. When will I learn.

So the smallish taco bell like entree, the desert and an Ice tea was 26 plus tip.  I think that high.  They also screwed up my waffle.  I asked for no whip.  The kitchen messed it up - not the waitress.

Also a few other comments:
 1. The restaurant itself is cute, but the open kitchen allows for that grease smell.  We both left smelling like old Chinese food.  

 2.  Management really should keep employees from congregating/eating in the dinning room.  Twice I had to walk back to the restroom and both times there were staff hanging out in the back table. Patrons have to past them to use the facilities.  I found it unprofessional..and more importantly, the table had unsightly half eaten take out and other garbage on it.  Also the bathroom could be cleaner. It wasn't terrible, but I think they get a lot of foot traffic from passers by due to it being tucked back by the back entrance. I.e. folks can slip in and out w/o anyone seeing them..

So to sum it up..my waffle was yummy and I LOVE waffles.  I'll go back for that alone..and I'll get water cause the prices are steep yo."}
{"text":"This is our typical post workout weekend spot. We always share a crepe and sandwich. I haven't tried any of the amazing looking, sugary/dessert crepes, but they are so wow! I go for more of the turkey, chicken and lamb dishes with pesto and avocado ingredients, and they are always great. They also have a nice coffee bar with speciality cafe drinks that I usually partake in. Would come here just for that. They have a nice patio outside on South Blvd, which is great for sunny Saturdays. If you're in for a fairly quick, flavorful lunch - I highly recommend this place. We've gotten the same waitress three times, and while she never remembers us, she has given us pretty good service each time. She will forget about us and then run over to make sure we're ok, I appreciate the hustle and effort. All in all, haven't had a bad meal here yet and continue to order new things. Definitely recommend you try this place!"}
{"text":"A must for breakfast or Brunch in Charlotte, the wait can be a little long, but the food is great."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Crispy crepe. pick your favorite savory  crepes on the menu  and you will  surely enjoy whatever you pick. The interior  is clean with touch of French  style decor. the people  are friendly. Look  for Raven. She got such a delightful personality. :) And Hey  don't go home without  their crispy crepe  desserts :)"}
{"text":"Was excited for this place to finally open as there signs were up for quite some time.  Went in one evening for dessert and coffee.  Took a small table with leather lounge type chairs.  When our two crepes and coffee were delivered (order at the counter and they bring out to you) the plates were hanging off the table and had to be very careful not to knock coffee of the table.  Mind you there were 4 chairs around this table.  The plates were huge which was overly annoying and not well thought out.  The crepes themselves were actually quite thick, very large, and overly sweet for my taste.  One would definately have been enough for two people to share (especially as a dessert).  I wish they would have advised of this when we were ordering.  Suggestion would be to advise customers of the size or possibly offer a smaller portion option.  I also found the prices to be a little on the high side for dessert.  Our two dessert crepes and specialty coffees were about $25.  I do have to say that they add a chocolate covered strawberry to each dessert (not that you really need any more to eat) that is absolutely delicious.  I will most likely not visit again but if I do will be very mindful of the portion size and prices."}
{"text":"My son & I had Sunday brunch here on Sept. 21, 2014 & we enjoyed every delicious moment.  To compliment the great food, we also had excellent service provided by our server Nicole.  A very pleasant & attentive young lady who made sure our dining experience was more than just about the food.  So thank you Nicole for the exemplary customer service."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday afternoon and started out with a delicious Creme Brulee latte. (They torch the sugar on top. So good!) I ordered the Bruschetta crepe and my boyfriend ordered one of the more dessert-y crepes, so I got to try a little of both. Both exceeded expectations! If you want to go to a place with interesting, delicious food, I would totally check it out. Already trying to figure out how soon is too soon to go back!"}
{"text":"seated right away but took awhile to get our water and latte..... 

was recommended the cookie butter latte and it is to die for. loved the cookie that came with it. 

ordered chefs omelette, strAwberry & banana  n nutella crepes   but there was probably a misunderstanding... no bananas in them but no problem. 

food is really great here but i agree on price- kinda a lil high but i will continue to come back. wished they open later :( great service too  . really a 4.5 stars"}
{"text":"I really liked it! I went there on a Sunday morning to buy some crepes to go. I ordered 2 gluten free crepes for me and my husband. We had a really good time eating it, because it was delicious! The crepe with the side is a lot of food, so if you are not hungry I recommend to share. The next time I want to eat in the restaurant because the place is cool and the staff nice!"}
{"text":"Top line: decent food, had a few quirks with service/layout.

Was surprised by this place, thought it would be a grab and go place, but it was a sit down place.  Waitress was super nice, but clearly didn't have much experience. 

Poor flow for the wait-staff, there was only one terminal, so there was perpetually a line. 

Weirdest part, they didn't have a hood over the cooking area so the whole place was kind of smokey. 

Bottom line: food was fine, but won't be back. If there were a few changes, might go back."}
{"text":"Today, I had the pleasure of stopping by for one of my most favorite crepes. CC makes a most satisfying buckwheat salmon, onion and goat cheese crepe. Once a \"special\" visitor on their menu, it resides as a regular on their permanent menu. A fresh pot of coffee was brewed for my meal as I arrived after the lunchtime rush. 
Service is always friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"I love everything that this brunch spot has to offer. We went with a group of 6 people and there was something on the menu for everyones cravings.

They have a variety of drinks to choose from (hot and cold). There were so many different speciality coffee drinks that I'll be sure to try the next time I visit. My boyfriend ordered the s'mores latte and got it iced. It came with marshmallows on top drizzled with chocolate and sprinkled with graham cracker. It was so good and I literally ended up stealing it from my boyfriend.

I liked that they had options for crepes - you could get sweet or savory. Perfect so that everyone can get what they are craving. I got the Herbed Ricotta Cheese and Spinach crepe. It had a ricotta and sun-dried tomato mixture inside with parmesan cheese, herbs, and fresh spinach with a roasted red pepper pesto on top. I ordered the potatoes as a side. It was such a good breakfast and I was not disappointed. The crepe was so big I was unable to finish the whole thing. My boyfriend got the chocolate peanut butter waffle which was also amazing.

Our server was great. She was personable and very nice. She offered us some suggestions and even told us some of her own favorites. We had a very good experience here."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great customer service! Can't go wrong with anything on the menu! I've been to around 75 restaurants in Charlotte and these guys can roll with the best of them! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Cute lil cafe atmosphere, service was pretty good, food was tasty, no complaints! I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I ate at Crispy Crepe with my husband on a Friday evening and truly enjoyed the experience. Although our food took a little time getting to us it was worth the wait. We ordered the Pecorino chicken and Bruschetta crepes and split them between ourselves. We both had the little hummus with cilantro side. We really enjoyed our food!!  I can truly say it was better than I expected. This was my first time eating at a crepe place....my husband's second. He said he enjoyed his crepes at Crispy Crepe better than another place he'd tried. I also thought the meal was filling. Although my mouth was salivating at the dessert crepe that was being served at the table beside us, I was too full to order dessert. I am so glad we took a chance on a Groupon deal for this or we probably wouldn't have known it existed. The atmosphere was relaxing and consequently we were very comfortable and enjoyed the evening at Crispy Crepe immensely. We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"What a welcome surprise! I've driven by here a million times but never when I'm hungry... til today. I decided to grab a crepe before I hit Atherton Market on a Saturday at 11:00, and I thought I might be the only one in there. Wrong! It was hoppin'. Thankfully, there was one parking space left in the garage.

There were a few tables with umbrellas outside, but inside was nothing like I'd pictured - there were probably 10-15 tables with a big, open kitchen so you can watch them make the crepes, which looked like works of art. The wall had a cute mural of a cafe painted on it, and it definitely had a quaint, cafe vibe. I was by myself, but I didn't feel out of place at a two-top table, and my waitress, Liz, was awesome. 

I had a cup of coffee (strong and delicious at $2.89), and after much deliberation, I decided on the apple streusel crepe ($10.99). Mmmmm. It was almost too pretty to eat - almost - and it tasted as good as it looked. The apples were tart and warm, and the walnuts and streusel were crunchy; the dollop of creme fraiche cheese on top was a welcome addition. I also loved that the crepe was hearty - I've had some crepes that are so thin they fall apart when you eat them, but not this one. I especially appreciated the chocolate-dipped strawberry and whipped cream on the side... was that only a garnish? Nom nom nom."}
{"text":"-soggy rubbery crepe
-cheap oj, tastes like minute maid
-Potatoes gratin tastes cheap with a Mac n cheese flavor

I wanted something classic so I got the maple cream crepe with coffee and oj and a side of Potatoes. Maple syrup wasn't high quality. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I stumbled across Crispy Crepe on Yelp when looking for somewhere to take my husband for Father's Day.  I was hoping to find a place that had food options that my husband and children (ages 28-13) would enjoy.  We were all pleasantly pleased with our choices.  Some of us started with coffee or tea and they were all unbelievable!!  The presentation was beautiful but the taste and uniqueness was even better!!  Every one of us loved our food choices - from waffles, to crepes, to omelettes...you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Came here with my mom who was visiting charlotte for the weekend. Small but really nice place with a great atmosphere. I ordered the Chipotle chicken crepes, which were very good. The portions were decently large and the coffee was great as well!"}
{"text":"Had brunch at this place on a Saturday. Cute little spot. The service wasn't stellar but it was OK. The waitress kept forgetting my glass of water. I ordered the Chocolate Nutella and Banana Crêpe. It was phenomenal.  Needless to say, can't go wrong with Nutella! Lol. The food was definitely satisfying.  My counterpart ordered the Hot Caramel Apple. The mug was almost overflowing with whipped cream, but was delicious! I will definitely return to try other crepes!"}
{"text":"It was okay. We didn't realize that they close at 3, so when we came in we were informed that they would close in 15 minutes & they would only take Togo orders. So we were given a menu, and honestly I felt kind of rush to order because he kept staring me down ready to take my order any sec, it was kind of understandable though. I ordered 1 savory crepe, and 1 sweet crepe. I picked the smoked salmon & the apple streusel. The smoked salmon also came with potatoes they were pretty good! Very creamy. The salmon crepe however was soooo friggin' dry, I just got tired of eating it halfway though. The apple streusel crepe though, tasted weird to me. The apples were pretty sour, and it was so salty? Was it suppose to be that salty? I had waaay better crepes, I don't know if whether they were rushing that's why it wasn't that tasty, but I was pretty disappointed especially for the $$ I paid lol! The shop however was very cute/chic, I like how each table had its own little cute flower & the wall art was lovely. But I don't know if I would be back, maybe to try their lattes ?"}
{"text":"Their prices are way to high for the way the food tastes.  I ordered the Belgium waffle and it tasted like wheat bread, not what I was expecting.  Also it was small.  The help is mediocre.  Definitely would not recommend this place to anyone.  Won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"Fantastic crepes. A lot of different kinds to choose from whether you're in the mood for savory or sweet. Really good coffee too. Might have to wait a little while to get a seat if you go on a weekend but not too long."}
{"text":"Best. Breakfast. I've. Ever. Had. 

This place is amazing! I got the cookie and cream crepes and they were phenomenal! Affordable and great service. I visited from out of town and now all I want is more crepes."}
{"text":"Crispy Crepe...can I take you back to California? By far one of the best breakfasts I have ever had!!! So good, I came twice in three days. Can't go wrong with the bacon, egg and cheese crepe...Delicious!!!! Lattes are spot on and they have a sugar free option. This place is bookmarked for my return."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try out Crispy Crepe since it opened, and finally made it there yesterday.  First off, let me say that the service was great.  Our server was very friendly and offered several great suggestions.  

I started with the ham and cheddar crepe (not sure if that is the actual name).  It honestly tasted just like a ham and cheese hot pocket.  Although I really like those hot pockets, and the crepe was good, I probably wouldn't order it again.  I would rather buy the $2.00 hot pocket from HT than the $7.99 crepe.  My fiancee got the chipotle chicken flat bread and said it was very good.

We ended the night with the peanut butter chocolate crepe.  Do yourself a favor and get this crepe.  It was delicious.  It had melted peanut butter cups that just oozed out when you cut into it, and mixed with the chocolate drizzle.  It was served with some whipped cream that was just ok and a chocolate covered strawberry.  I honestly want another one right now.

So, overall a good experience.  I'm definitely going to go  back.  There menu us pretty big and several options looked tasty.  Be careful about sitting outside.  Although it was a nice spot, we were annoyed by numerous flies the entire meal."}
{"text":"First time here. Got an espresso, smoothie, strawberry and Nutella crepe, and bruschetta crepe. All was fabulous. The bruschetta had a good amount of cheese in it, which is always a plus. The au gratin potatoes were on point. Service was very slow and inattentive, to put it kindly. Got my own to go containers, cups, etc."}
{"text":"This was my first time to Crispy Crepe and I'm not sure how I feel about my experience. My feelings are a little mixed. To start, the place is in a great location, the atmosphere is nice, and all of the food looks really good. 

When my wife and I first walked in, it was very smoky inside. To the point it felt like I was in the kitchen the entire time. I even left smelling like I just worked a shift at the Waffle House. They even had to prop the doors open, but that did not help at all.

The staff was nice and very helpful. I just wasn't sure what to get as there were many options that looked appealing. I settled for the eggs, turkey bacon and waffle plate. It also came with a hash brown casserole scoop. The turkey bacon and eggs were good and so was the hash browns. The waffle on the other hand is part of why I docked a star. It was the most dense and thick waffle I have ever had. It was like eating a tough piece of bread. It was not fluffy or soft at all. It had a good flavor, but I could not stop saying to my wife how tough it was the entire time. I even had trouble cutting it with my knife at times. I'm not sure why this is the case but it's enough for me to never want a waffle there again. 

To make matters worse, if I wanted some of the toppings on my waffle, I would be charged an additional $4. Which is kind of ridiculous, being that I was already being charged $12 for the plate. There was also no option for anything other than the turkey bacon. My wife had a crepe and they charged her $3 extra to add the chicken on it. For the price that we paid, I expected to be blown away and I felt very let down. The price, the food and the smoke everywhere is why I'm giving them 3 stars. Many people there seemed to enjoy their food and I might have just ordered the wrong thing."}
{"text":"Delicous! I always get their specialty crepe - cookie butter. It's so addictive that I always tend to order same crepes whenever I'm here with my friends. I love their drinks also. S'MORES LATTE IS THE BEST!"}
{"text":"Great place to come for brunch on a lazy Sunday
Service and food was good!
Would definitely come back for brunch"}
{"text":"We were seated quickly on a Sunday afternoon. The service and food was great! We'd definitely return."}
{"text":"Marcia took great care of us! The cookie crepe was phenomenal and their soy lattes are killer."}
{"text":"Our new favorite crepe place in Charlotte! Loved this place! We had a savory and sweet crepe and both were delicious!!"}
{"text":"Went here last weekend for a late lunch to sit outside with a friend. We split the Caesar Asparagus Salad and the Grilled Cheese Portabella mushroom sandwich which were really tasty! Definitely good quality products!  As others have said, the parking is a little hairy if you go at a busy time but there are normally spots in the parking deck behind the restaurant. 

Though our server was extremely sweet and informative, it seemed our food took longer than expected, especially since we were 1 of 2 tables there at the time (over 25 minutes).
If you're in a rush, this isn't the place for you. Definitely a place to sit back and relax. Absolutely willing to give it a go again though since the food was so delicious!

Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Had the cookie butter waffle, the onion soup, and herb chicken crepe (table shared the first two) Slam packed. It was fresh. Service was somewhat slow. 
I will definitely return."}
{"text":"An hour to get a soup and salad?? Everyone around us who has come in after us is finishing up and my food still isn't here.. Never again.. The waitress seems mad I'm asking where my food is... There are only about 5 tables including inside and out.."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast brunch or lunch.
They have some really great crepe options with veggies and protein or you can go sweet. Like
Bananas and Carmel, apples or strawberries, you pick the combo or select from delicious options and you will be sure to be pleased.

They have waffles that are so rich and delicious. I don't recommend that as your meal. (Too heavy) But share one at your table. A few bites and you will be wondering where they have been all your life! 

Their specialty drinks are so good and their Salads at lunch are yummy too! 
I've never had a bad meal. 
Service varies, we've hit the jack pot a few times and often are left disappointed. 

They have indoor or outdoor seating and are conveniently located in south end. There's a parking deck down the alley behind the restaurant. 

If you haven't been try it out :)"}
{"text":"I am hard on crepes, since I've been out of the states and have had them in International territory-where they basically live off crepes for their only diet.  I had a breakfast crepe and it was good, but the crepe itself seemed too dense-like a pancake, when in actuality, it should be quite light and fluffy-and served in a cone shape, not on a plate like an omelette.  The service was delightful and I would like to give them a try for a sweet crepe sometime.  If they blow my mind, I will revise my review. :)"}
{"text":"Celiacs beware!! Today was our third visit. The first time was great, second time we ordered the same as the first time and to our disappointment it was nothing like the first time. Then, today, it was actually good, so this tells me of their inconsistency, however, that's not why I'm writing this review.  I am CELIAC (MUST have a Gluten Free diet) and for any of you aware of what that is, the MUST is non negotiable, apparently Crispy Crepe is ignorant of this and SHOULDN'T offer \"gluten-free if they are not going to adhere to the claim or understand the effects of cross-contamination, etc. After such a lovely lunch with my family, I am now dealing with the ill effects of gluten contamination. Shame.."}
{"text":"We stopped in just to see what the crepes were all about. I do wish that the staff could have help recommend things. 

The food is delish. The crepe I had was a double trouble with fruit, glazes, chocolate and whip cream.

It was my first time at the restaurant and the waitress did a great job on helping me decide on my choice."}
{"text":"Crispy Crepe is the cutest brunch place with its beautifully decorated decor of a French shoppe. The food too is beautiful and delicious, from its crepes to its waffles. There is a great variety of the type of crepes you can order, not only just for breakfast, but also savory lunch crepes and sweet desert crepes. My boyfriend and I found this place, and it became one of our top brunch restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Since Crispy Crepe is near my apartment complex, I was so excited for its opening. My first visit there was a late weekday. I ordered the Turkey Fontina sandwich, which was decent. Very average flavors despite its description. The \"gourmet salad\" was incredibly underwhelming. It consisted of chickpeas and some sparse feta vegetable-ish stuff. I ordered a croissant for the morning but they were out. To compensate, they included some chocolate strawberries. Nice touch! Definitely the highlight of the meal. Thank God that strawberry is in their logo. 

Ok, so the first meal 3/5 but then again... I didn't try their specialty. Armed for round two, I checked Yelp for recommendations. Despite some of the other reviews, I got myself a crepe for dinner tonight. Crispy Crepe? More like Chewy Crepe. You guys are right! The crepe was doughy, thick, and TOUGH. I couldn't bite into it, let alone cut it with a fork and knife. I ordered the Chocolate Chip Cannoli Crepes which called for ricotta filling and chocolate chips. Honestly, the filling felt cheap and almost offensive. The ricotta filling was thin and granular with no hint of ricotta. It was like they were trying to pull a fast one. I would have much rather walked across the street and gotten a real one from Nova's. The crepes came with a side of fruit in the same soupy creme. And my chocolate covered strawberry--the star of my previous meal--was partially mushy.

This sealed the deal. I wanted to like Crispy Crepe. I really did! The owner is such a nice man, and the staff is very accommodating. However, for a more expensive lunch joint, I need better quality and substance."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday morning with a large group. Bring your own wine so we went to cvs across the street.  ALL  the food was delicious and well plated. The place was packed with about 2 to 3 waiters. Great place to come on a date. I will definitely visit again. EVERYTHING was delicious."}
{"text":"Food here was a different concept from my usual outing but it was good. The gyro crepe was delicious and I would prefer the au gratin potatoes."}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM!! The pictures shown are from our 4th visit to crispy crepe because the other times we've scarfed down the food so quickly. Shown are: Nutella and strawberry crepe, s'mores crepe, and cookies and cream. The drink is the cookie butter latte. Everything is to die for. We've gotten the savory crepes in the past and they're good but the sweet ones we can't get enough of."}
{"text":"I wanted to try one of everything! We started with hummus with toast and pita. I had the goat cheese, spinach and chicken crepe. It was huge and delicious. My friend had a very generous salad. I can't wait to go back & try the dessert crepes and coffees."}
{"text":"Go to crepe spot uptown. They have a huge array of coffees and breakfast foods but I don't know why you would come and not order a crepe or Belgium waffle. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but when I went yesterday it was so disappointing.  The coffee was gross AND lukewarm.  They only had individual non dairy creamers.  I mean, come on!  You're a breakfast place and you don't have half and half for coffee?  My eggs were so bland; the turkey bacon was actually grilled ham (or the softest \"bacon\" ever).  The waffle was ok but not nearly as good as it has been in the past.  I probably won't come back.  I spent $20 after tip and for that much money I could've had an AMAZING breakfast at Cafe Monte."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and am always pleased! First time I got a savory crepe for lunch and a desert crepe to share with my friend. Today I got the shrimp and avocado salad which was delicious! It is nice to know they have more then just crepes here. My friend that came with me wanted breakfast and they had omelettes. The waitress was very sweet and on top of her game. If you want something different then the standard sandwich or salad lunch, give this place a try."}
{"text":"The Cinnamon waffle was very dense and not sweet, dry even with syrup. My wife had the gyro crape and was not impressed. Nothing was bad, just not very good. Coffee was above average"}
{"text":"The workers are great, the prices are fair but the quality of the ingredients are extremely fresh and most of all DELICIOUS. I speak to everyone about this place: they all feel exactly like I do, Extremely satisfied. This is a must go to spot for all of those living in the southend area."}
{"text":"This is such a cute cafe.  Stop by and have a cup or coffee or grab a bite to eat.

 I had not heard a lot about this place besides what I read on Yelp but purchased a deal on Living Social to try it out. We stopped in the day before Valentines day so it was fairly slow. I had the Shrimp Crepe which was awesome. The outside was crispy though the inside that was wrapped around a ton of filling was a bit chewy as others have pointed out. I still loved my meal.  My boyfriend wanted to try the Shawarma and asked that it be made as a crepe. Just as others had found the chef had no issues accommodating this and he said it too was really good. I also had a Vanilla Cafe Latte which was so good. We sat around for a while after dinner chatting over our coffee.   I can't wait until it is warm enough to sit out on the patio."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place since it opened, and buying the Groupon gave me just such an opportunity to do so.  Thus, my partner and I ventured here fairly early on a Saturday morning for breakfast.

Cookie Butter Latte:  Holy cow, this drink was flippin' awesome.  It was not too sweet, tasted very smooth, and I absolutely loved the cookies that came with it.  All the flavors came together well to produce a tasty drink.  I would come back here again just for this drink.  (5/5)

Americano:  Surprisingly, this was not as good as the latte.  I suppose when you add the milk and sweetness, you really don't get a lot of the coffee flavor.  By itself, the coffee was a little plain tasting and a little bitter.  (2/5)

Maple Delight Waffle:  When this came out, my first thought was that it was so small for the price.  However, when I cut into, I realized how dense the waffle was.  I suppose that's not surprising, since it's made from dough rather than a batter.  The flavor of the waffle itself was good, and I liked the thick yet soft texture of it.  The waffle itself was fairly sweet.  When you added the maple cream, whipped cream, and syrup, it was more like eating a dessert than eating a breakfast dish.  It was good, but a little too sweet and rich.  I could not finish it.  (3/5)

Egg and Bacon Cheddar Crepe:  I don't think I have ever had crepes this thin and crispy, which was definitely different.  The crepe itself was lighter in texture and less doughy than other ones I've had, and I really enjoyed that.  However, it had very little of the bacon in it and was mostly eggs.  That was a little disappointing.  The bacon that was in it was  good, though, and overall I did enjoy it.  For the price, though, the portions were not terribly big.  (3/5)

The staff was pretty friendly and efficient.  Our food came out quickly.  It's bright and cheery in there and I love the open design.  It's nice that they have decent parking in the garage and some street parking as well, but I am guessing there is an issue later in the evening when World of Beer starts filling up.

Overall, it was good, but without the Groupon, I don't know if I felt like everything was worth it.  I'd be willing to try it again.  Goodness knows I will likely come back here next time I'm craving that cookie butter latte."}
{"text":"I have eaten there many times and they are always cautious with my severe food allergies.  I would have given a 5 star but the service has been hit or miss by some of the waiters they bring in.  A couple have been amazing and then some don't belong around people at all.  They just don't have the charisma to wait on people.  But overall I'm happy with eating there and some of the best hummus I have had, too!"}
{"text":"I'm s sucker for a crispy crêpe, and I've had many from different places.  While I wouldn't put the ones here at the top of the list, they are decent and I've enjoyed each of my visits.  I ope for the vegetarian crêpe, and I haven't been disappointed yet.  The au gratin potatoes are also a hit.  

Why not 5 stars?  Their coffee drinks could be a little better; I haven't been wowed yet, but I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"I went to Crispy Crepe for the first time today. I have the Chipotle Chicken Crepe. It was delightful. I highly recommend the Au Gratin potatoes as a side. The only recommendation I would make to this establishment would be to carry ranch. A nice chipotle ranch would have been the perfect finishing touch! Other than that....a good find!"}
{"text":"We went there with a living social we bought so I expected a crowd. After getting a seat we got in line and it took roughly ten minutes to order it seemed they did not have a grasp on how to run things smoothly. I was not told I had to get my own coffee so I waited until everything was brought out and then was told. Our food was not that great my gf got a Nutella banana and said it was over cooked and lacking In banana . I got a bacon cheddar egg and it had tons of cheese lousy turkey bacon and hardly any egg. So the food was not so good and the service and all around design was not great. I know they are new so we might give it another try in 6 months."}
{"text":"My husband and I adore this place. We have only eaten here twice but holy cow is it good. I have tried to make leige waffles as home many times with imported pearl sugar, and they're never half as good as Crispy Crepe's are. We both work in the restaurant industry and this place is great. I get the cookie butter waffle with bananas and whipped cream - pure heaven on a plate. We will continue to eat here as long as it stands. We always go on weeknights to avoid the crazy weekend crowd. Thank you for providing quality food!"}
{"text":"How is it possible that this place is only 3.5 stars?! We go here every Sunday morning. We take our pups and sit outside. Everything serve ever had, which is pretty much everything, has been absolutely delicious! The specialty coffee are also insanely good."}
{"text":"Wanted a savory crepe so I ordered a sweet coffee drink - it worked out well.

YUMMM. The mocha latte is so delicious and creamy and not-too-sweet and just perfect. The savory crepe was awesome, too - chock-full of ingredients, loaded with avocado, and nicely seasoned chicken. Really hearty, huge, and so good.

Au gratin potatoes are to die for. I wish I could have a whole plate of those.

Had to wait about 25-30 minutes around 10:30am on a Sunday morning, but it was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I ordered the cookie butter latte and the bonafie crepe. Both were delicious! My husband ordered the chipotle chicken crepe and I couldn't stop taking bites from his plate. 

Service is great as well, they are very fast. A great breakfast/brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Bacon egg and cheese crêpe is amazing"}
{"text":"Great crepes and fantastic artisan coffee!  The lunch menu looks fantastic and very nice cafe atmosphere.  Staff were very nice, service was great, and there is a really comfortable seating are with free wifi.  Can't wait to go back and try more especially since they are open early and stay open until 9 or 9:30 for dinner!"}
{"text":"Crispy crepe catered one of my work breakfasts for a client.  The client was so happy.  They said it was the best breakfast any rep had ever done.  They will be my go to for client breakfasts in the future."}
{"text":"Just OK. My apple crepe was really dry. The potatoes needed salt. The latte drinks were very tasty, as were the chocolate strawberries. The worst part is the grease smell that my clothes absorbed and had to smell the rest of the day. Definitely overpriced. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Expensive, seems like portion wise they give you more for the savory crepes rather than sweet. The maple crunch crepe was pretty small, and heavy. Sole kind of cream looking thing inside of it that looks like ice cream. Not a very healthy option for sure but great if you have a sweet tooth. Not really worth $10.75 if you ask me, and not very filling.

The smoked salmon goat cheese egg crepe was surprisingly pretty good. Unfortunately the smoked salmon would have been better if they cook crepe first and then add it in to still keep the cold smoked texture, rather the salmon in the crepe is cooked. You get to choose a side with this crepe..some options were fruits(honey dew, sweet melon and pineapple slices), kettle chips etc

Pretty sparse for 10am but it started getting busy around 11. Overall i feel like there are better crepe places out there that are more economical. I am not a big fan of spending more than necessary just for the hype"}
{"text":"Nothing hits the spot like crepes and this place is the bomb! Whether you're a savory person or sweet -- you'll have no problem finding a satisfiying crepe on their extensive menu. Personally.. I'm savory but most people I've dined with are sweet and, let me tell you, Crispy Crepe does not disappoint!  I had a chorizo and egg crepe the last time I dined here and it was so good! The person I was with got a sweet breakfast crepe and gobbled it up! The coffee was yummy too and they even gave me a to-go cup of Joe without me asking. I love this place! New addiction in Southend!"}
{"text":"OMG Sweeeeeeeeeeeet Waffle!  Ate half because it was like having pie for breakfast.  Would definitely get this as a dessert & split it with my sweetie.  The waffle itself was delicious.  I would rather have had that with less creamy, gooey, carmel, sweetness first thing in the morning.  Serious Sugar Bomb.

The apple crepe was ok.  The crepe wasn't bad, but I didn't finish it.  The apples were small-chopped & when I tried to cut into the crepe for a bite, the apples just slid away or slid out.  I ended up just scooping out the apples/oatmeal/nuts & eating that & leaving most of the crepe untouched.

The hot chocolate & mocha were well-made & tasty.

I really wanted to like this place, they have a nice patio area, but for breakfast, it just didn't cut it.

I might have to go back & try a savory crepe, or get that waffle conglomeration for dessert one evening after dinner somewhere else.  

It's 3 stars just for that waffle.  Otherwise I'd have been at 2.5."}
{"text":"It's Sunday Brunch season and Crispy Crepe was our restaurant of choice. I ordered the Eggs and Turkey waffle platter with potatoes. The potatoes were the best thing on the plate. The waffle was dry, hard, and flavorless. The fact that you have to pay $2.99 for syrup is ridiculous so I had three bites and left the rest on my plate. I will say again the potatoes were wonderful! The service was subpar. Our waitress got all of our orders mixed up when the plates came so my eggs were on my cousins plate, her waffle was on a friend's plate, someone's turkey bacon was on her plate and someone else got a plate with absolutely nothing they ordered. So it took about three trips for everything to get fixed. The waitress was rude and stated \" Well, usually when people order their food they know what they ordered and can tell us before the servers give them the plate\". She brought the tickets at the end of the meal and had additional charges on my ticket for something that I didn't have. I am allergic to citrus so I am not able to drink orange juice. The fact that she added a charge of $2.99 for Orange Juice that would send me to the hospital if I drink it was outrageous. At no point did I have anything to drink other than water. Needless to say she did not get a tip because of her lacking service,  smart remarks, @and erroneous charges. I will certainly not be going back there for brunch. As a foodie,  this experience left me very disappointed on multiple levels."}
{"text":"What a mistake. I should have listened to the negative reviews on here.

We arrived on a Sunday morning, and after looking at the menu, we were unsure. The place looked fast-food and casual, but the prices were $11-12 for a crepe!

We were sat fairly quickly and went ahead and put in our order so we could eat quickly. First, the waiter screwed up our order and put the wrong thing in, and then told us 3 times that our food was almost out. It took 40 minutes for us to finally get our food after we ordered, and the manager even brought out the wrong side after they had already corrected my order once. We couldn't get the waiter's attention to get a straw so we got up and found one ourselves. 

Overall, the wait and the service was horrible. After expressing my concerns with the manager, he only told me that yes, that sounded frustrating and then brought me my food. Did not even bother to partially pay for my check.

I will never return here and never tell anyone to go here again. GO TO CAFE MONTE IN SOUTH PARK. I can not say this enough. The quality of the crepes are a million times better, and even though it's about $2 more expensive, the environment, quality, and service are a million times worth it."}
{"text":"This is a cute little get away for coffee or desserts, its great for a date or just going to hang out.  I had the apple streusel crepe and it was very delish, my friend had the cinnamon roll crepe and it was VERY sweet; almost like  cinnamon toast crunch cereal.  I do recommend this place for something fun and quaint and its very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Dessert for breakfast! so good. They also offer healthy gluten free options :)"}
{"text":"Not dog friendly.  Owner was very rude.  Charged me $4 for a bowl my dog licked.  For some reason they can't clean dishes there.  Used to be a frequent customer but that's the last time I will dine there.

The response from \"said g\" should be posted somewhere in their restaurant.  Would've been much more cordial than extorting another $4 from a paying customer."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in all of charlotte!! Went there before a panthers game and even tho it was busy, service was fast!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I had to take the light rail up to South Blvd. to pick up some concert tickets from a radio station.  We were getting hungry and there were several restaurants to choose from.  This one just seemed to be right down our alley.  The funny thing is we didn't get a crepe; I got a salad and my daughter got the grilled cheese and portabella sandwich.  Both were delicious.  The dressing wasn't heavy-handed on the salad and the grilled shrimp were spiced just right.  The servers were attentive and it was small enough where we didn't have to scream at each other to have a decent conversation over the din of a lot of people.  Can't wait to have another reason to head back!"}
{"text":"I've never been a crepe fan until eating here. There was no wait upon arrival. The menu is nice, with plenty to choose from...but not overwhelming. I had the chicken, goat cheese, and spinach crepe. It was nothing short of  delectable. The flavors were front and center in each bite. They are not stingy when it comes to filling the crepes, I had enough left over to take home for a small lunch. Our server was very patient with us and checked on us throughout our meal. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice since moving here in October and the first time i was blown away so maybe this second time just didn't live up the expectations i had set. The first time i got the Smoked Turkey with White Stilten Cranberry Cheese which was great. I do wish that there had been less caramelized onions on the sandwiches but it was all together great. The real star of that meal was my mom's Basil Grilled Chicken Sandwich. It was fantastic. We got this in October when she moved me into my apartment and seriously still talks about this sandwich like it was god's gift to earth. It was a great sandwich and i'd definitely get it next time i go in for lunch. The second time i went i got the Egg 'n' Turkey Bacon Waffle Platter with overeasy eggs and a side of the potatoes. The potatoes are good but very very cheesy. They were a bit much for me and i LOVE cheese. My eggs were runny which was really disappointing. The waffle was good but very dry. I felt that i needed to drench it in syrup to be completely happy with it. Both of my friends got crepes and loved their meals. I think that i've learned my lesson to stick with the crepes next time."}
{"text":"I have now eaten their twice. Both times I was extremely impressed both times. They luckily have the menu broken down by sweet and savory flavors of crepes. I have eaten one from eat and my daughter loves the cookies and creme one. My wife is also extremely impressed. I recommend this for anyone. Although if you plan to go with a group you will prob wait a long time. I recommend going during the week and going around 1pm. Not busy then."}
{"text":"I heard about this new crepes place in town and thought I'd check it out. I should have looked at reviews online before going. The ambiance is not what I expected. It kind of has a cheap feel to it once inside. Maybe it was the website and pictures that made me have higher expectations.

I ordered one of their specialties - the maple cream crepe. It was okay, but way overpriced at $10. My friend drinks coffee (I don't). She had to ask for another latte, because there were coffee grinds in her drink. When she got the new latte she said, \"I think the coffee is just bad here.\" I didn't have any issues with the food taking a long time or it being crowded. There is another crepes place in NoDa (farther from me in South Charlotte) that I think is better. 

Bottom line: Sounds like it would be great, but very lackluster and not worth going."}
{"text":"First time here and I can't wait to come back and try something else. Loved the food, beverage options, but my favorite was the service. The girl was super kind, respectful, and great at her job. This is a direct representation of the management team. Great JOB! I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"See my tip...I think the main concern is the parking. Don't be! It's in the back, INTO the garage which is absolutely free and safe.  HOMEMADE CREPES in EVERY order - and keep in mind, it's NOT small. It's pretty big crepe, even when it's folded. Defy thumbs up!! CUTE place to dine... I will return for breakfast one day SOON! ...and the price? Really? Can you actually find a fault with this???"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite get away!!!!! You have to try this place if you haven't already. Breakfast & lunch are both delicious. Desert is to die for and the staff is more than friendly. My daughter and I are regular visitors here. Cozy cute place. You can eat inside and outside."}
{"text":"Ok let me start by saying it was a living social coupon that got me in the door but i would be happy to return and pay regular price.  I saw the coupon and I checked yelp which i am prone to do and I saw the mixed reviews so I said what the heck i have a coupon if its horrible i don't have to go back.  Well me and my girlfriend were very happy we decided to give it a try. 

 I can only speak from my one experience but it was top notch.  We went around 2:30pm on a tuesday, there were about  2 or 3 other parties seated and it was not busy at all so we were seated immediately.  I ordered the smores latte and my girlfriend ordered the cookie butter latte, i am not much for warm drinks other than hot chocolate but i just wanted to try this and its was very very good.  My girlfriend is a coffee and espresso lover and she said she would come back just for these latte's in the future.  Waitress who was named jesse also brought us some waters without us asking which was very nice.  She did a very good job throughout our experience checking on us. 

For our entrees I chose the chipotle chicken crepe and my girlfriend had the Mediterranean chicken crepe.  They were both exceptional and i am a picky eater to say the least, i would order either again.  I am not a crepe connoisseur so i can't speak for authenticity or anything else but i know good tasting food and this was it.  Portions were large we both had enough to take home and basically have a whole second meal later.  I could have finished mine but wanted to try a waffle for dessert.  The au gratin potatoes were similar to a hashbrown casserole, i added some siracha to mine and enjoyed them, my girlfriend said hers were good also and enjoyed hers plain.  

For dessert we tried the cookie butter waffle, their \"liege\" style waffles with bananas whipped cream and this cookie butter stuff, it was sweet and decadent and very good. It is not gonna be a hot crispy and fluffy waffle so don't expect that or you will be disappointed, it is more dense and chewy but that is the way its suppose to be according to them and it was fine with me just know what your getting before you order it.    

I don't leave reviews everywhere i go but this was a place that had mixed reviews and i was on the fence about trying but I'm very happy I did and we will go back for sure.  I can't comment on busy weekends or anything else but this tuesday afternoon was a pure delight!"}
{"text":"Our food was good, but the service is painfully slow. It took 20 minutes after being seated before the waitress even took our food order, and then an additional half hour before the food made it to the table. I realize it isn't fast food, but that's just painful and not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Love this place, but the decor could use some work. Crepes are the size of your head and are divine."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went around noon on a Sunday. It was a nice amount of ppl there, but we were able to get a table right away. I ordered the Cookie Butter Crepe w/strawberries and it was delish!!!! We sat right next to the grill and I thought that was pretty neat. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The food has become inconsistent. I had to send my disgusting egg and veggie crepe back. Do you know she charged me for the fruit that came with the crepe, regardless  I ordered another crepe. That was the Mediterranean. I have been here before and had this same crepe and this time it was nasty. The shrimp were cold and unseasoned. The spinach was flavorless and barely warmed. It was dry. The sauce was scarce. Even the freaking side salad was terrible. As if all this was not enough, I asked for another cup of hot tea and she said, \"I can bring you some water, but I have to charge you for another tea bag.\" WHAT!!!! Hell no!"}
{"text":"Great food, but don't come here with more than four people. You will never get seated. Management wouldn't let the hostess put two four seat tables together for us, but they will seat two people in those tables instead of them sitting on the open two seat tables and make groups larger than four wait indefinitely. We only had six in our group and we weren't sure if we would ever get seated.

Other than that, great food and good service."}
{"text":"Was visiting a friend in Charlotte and she took me to this place. I ordered some bruschetta crepe with cilantro jalapeno and pita chips, it was pretty good! But it was a few months back and I dont exactly remember loving it. I also ordered an iced chai latte..it was ok, I've had better."}
{"text":"I have to update my review. I still love the food here but this place has become so unreliable. I have had bad experiences the last two times I came. I tried placing a pick up order about 15 minutes before close last time. Called about 5 times with no answer. Arrived 8 minutes before close and two men said that they already closed for the day. I questioned them about the posted closing times to which they responded that it was a few minutes before close and they were done for the day. I told them I had been trying to call in a pick order with no answer and they were just like \"oh.\" Then this current time they were out of waffles by 11am...


Original Review:::
Love this place. The European waffles are just like the gofres in Spain! The Shwarma Lamb pita is a force to be reckoned with. Great for brunch and regular lunch. Haven't had a bad meal here yet. So glad this place exists here in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place is okay. We didn't wait long for a table but we did wait to get our drink order taken, and then about 20 minutes for our food, which was one crepe and one cinnamon waffle. Our waitress was busy I guess because she didn't seem to check on us often, and she didn't really speak up which she needed to do because that place is loud. 

I got my waffle and wanted a steak knife to cut through it. I remember going to a waffle place that had waffles like these before, and they were done in 5 minutes and I didn't need a sharp knife to cut through them. So this waffle wasn't my favorite waffle. On my list of favorite waffles it comes in right under that weird store brand frozen waffle I bought one time because there was a picture of a meadow on the box. In retrospect what does a meadow have to do with waffles? I don't know. 

My friend didn't like the coffee but my frozen mocha smoothie was pretty alright. He got a gyro crepe and said it was basically a salad stuffed into a crepe. The potatoes au gratin were pretty good though. 

One thing I didn't like was the lack of sides you could order. I figure you can order sides, but it would have been nice to see what was available instead of having to rely on the soft spoken waitress who I could not hear."}
{"text":"I live over 40 minutes away so was not very happy when I arrived and discovered they decided to close an hour early. 
This is not the first time they've done this and it's very annoying. I won't be coming back and will give my money to another business that wants it more. 
This is not very good business practice and feel like they're letting teenagers run this place."}
{"text":"Such a yummy breakfast spot - you can bring dogs and sit outside, gets busy of the weekends but they turn tables fairly fast and food comes fairly quick.  Great lattes too!"}
{"text":"This place is ok, but I don't know that I will be rushing back.  I had the egg and veggie cheddar crepe.  I really liked it but i agree with the other reviews that they are more rubbery crepes than crispy.  My wife had the waffle, egg, and turkey bacon platter.  The waffle was extremely dense.  We couldn't tell if it was under cooked or if that was how it was intended.  The flavor reminded me of a soft pretzel dough...kind of.  All in all..not bad...not great...but with so many unique items on the menu we will probably give it another try one of these days."}
{"text":"Great way to start an late Saturday morning. 

Came here with a buddy after a round of golf and this place hit the spot. It was busy, but took really long to get seated--about thirty minutes.  Given the simplicity of preparing the crepes, the rose itself took a long time to get to us.  Server was very detailed and repeated our order but still got the sides wrong--mine on buddy's plate and vice versa. She was nice so I can't knock her for that.  The crepes themselves were tasty an very filling.  The berry shake though, is where it's at!

Still coming back here bc the shake was so good... Did I tell you how good the shake is here?

dmo out."}
{"text":"Crispy Crepe... What to say about this place.. i feel like a kid in a candy shop.. Everything here is well done, even the coffee is some of the best Ive had.

See you guys soon"}
{"text":"It wasn't bad, but I wasn't impressed. There was more crepe than filling, no distinct flavors everything tasted monotone. I didn't like the setup of the dining floor, felt like they grouped certain crowds together.  The Belgian Waffle had so much whipped topping and caramel you couldn't taste the waffle.  We've had better."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to Crispy Crepe a handful of times now, and I do like them very much (with the exception of their specialty coffees).

We've only been here for breakfast, and I like that they open early on weekends.  They also have a barista and offer a variety of specialty coffee drinks, but I'll warn you that the syrup-flavored drinks are OVERLY sweet.  The chai latte I had one time was honestly so sickly sweet I couldn't drink more than the first sip.  The server could tell I wasn't drinking it, but never asked if anything was wrong.  Boo.  I'm much happier just getting a cappuccino or latte since that occurred.

Crispy Crepe will modify any crepe you choose with more or fewer fillings.  I like getting their egg, bacon, and cheese crepe, but placing the turkey bacon on the side (for my husband), and then adding avocado and chipotle crema.  Wow, that's an awesome combination!  And their crepes are FILLED.

My husband has been more adventurous, trying several of the sweet crepe varieties, as well as their avocado BLT.  He's liked everything he's had so far.

Their sides are very good.  We've tried their salad, as gratin potatoes, and fruit.  The salad is really delicious and my favorite, topped with their homemade creamy vinaigrette (with basil?).  Their at gratin potatoes are good, but are never served hot enough, temperature-wise.  We've sent them back a couple of times for reheating.  The fruit is best in summer.

Service is usually very fast.  And they have a lot of outdoor seating covered by umbrellas, so it's nice sitting outside in both summer and winter.

All in all, we recommend Crispy Crepe.  Just beware of the specialty coffees if you don't like your drinks very sweet."}
{"text":"*shrugs* I thought it was pretty good.  I know nothing of crepes, so I couldn't tell ya the difference between a good one and a not so good one.  Mine was tasty.  I ordered the egg and veggie crepe and Hubs ordered a bacon and ham one.  Both were good and not too soggy.  I think crepe's are supposed to be thinner so that would be my only complaint.  Service was really friendly and the place is really clean. Oh and my dish came with a side of either fruit or Jasmin rice.  I opted for the rice.  I thought it was going to be hot in temp but they served it COLD.  It shocked my taste buds for a sec, but it's really good.  You would think it to be warm! so that was a nice surprise.  
 Again...*shrugs* I liked it and will go back.  I won't make a special trip, but I'll at least go again if I'm in the area.  :-)"}
{"text":"Oh my word super yummy.. some reviews say its pricey but  I found it was fine for the amount of/quality of food  and Service was great. We will definitely be back and just F.Y.I I don't eat Lamb but the hubby got the Shawarma Lamb.... He has not stop talking it about!!!! Ohhhhhhh and get the the potatoes.... yummy... I had a crêpe with bacon egg and cheese its turkey bacon which was good and a latte with cookie butter and it was super yummy, make sure you stir it because the goodness is at the bottom.

Just had Take out.... it was still yummy this time had Chicken Shawarma!!!!! My new favorite sandwich!!! I was happy!!! Will be back soon!!! Thank yet again!!!!"}
{"text":"I've lived in the neighborhood for several months but had the pleasure of trying this place for the first time this weekend for breakfast. I enjoyed the eggs and waffle plate with turkey bacon and potatoes. I had the Hazlenut waffle which was a delicious mix of Nutella, fresh strawberries and whipped cream. Needless to say it was heavenly and just writing this review is making me crave that perfection. Service wasn't anything too special, but it wasn't terrible either. I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I wasn't overly impressed with this place.  I hoped it'd be better than it was.  The entire restaurant was very smoky inside and I couldn't breathe well.  My food was average, but made my stomach hurt later!!! I might give it another try sometime. The service was decent.  The prices were ok too."}
{"text":"A hot date chose this place for Sunday brunch and I am SO glad that he did! We arrived around 2 on a Sunday and there was no line, so we were seated immediately. Our waitress, Aubrey, was patient as it was my first time here and it took awhile to review the menu. I had the strawberry and nutella crepe and my date had the shrimp and pesto crepe. My crepe was delicious. It's supposed to be more of a dessert option, but so be it. The strawberries were fresh and plentiful. Couldn't ask for more. I was able to taste my date's crepe and it was extremely good too. Think I'll have it the next time I go, as I will certainly be returning soon."}
{"text":"Excellent food gorgeous atmostphere incredibly delicious. Love this place reasonable prices for a highly recommended food."}
{"text":"AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!  We got the turkey bacon, cheese, avocado, & mushroom crepe...my husband loved it.  Also, we got the veggie & added shrimp, it was great!  The side salad and potatoes au gratin as our sides.  The hazelnut latte & micha were amazing.  Great spot for breakfast, brunch, lunch, or just coffee and dessert."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!  I had a late breakfast here today and I can say, without a doubt, that I will be back.  I ordered the Cookie Butter Waffle and a side of the Au Gratin potatoes.  The Cookie Butter Waffle was garnished with bananas, whipped cream, and a delicious Biscoff cookie (I'm a Flight Attendant, so I know all about the Biscoff).  Very sweet, but I didn't expect anything else.  And the potatoes were absolutely delicious too!  Since it was a weekday afternoon, the place wasn't busy, which I appreciated.  My server was very sweet and attentive.  I can't wait to return and try their lattes!"}
{"text":"This was a great little find. (thanks to yelp)

These folks specialize in crepes and waffles. I have fallen in love with the Maple waffle, YUM!

The food portions are about right and the choices on the menu are all quite health when you thing about it. 

Dexter and I love this place because they have a nice outdoor seating that is far enough away from the road.

They do a great job at recognizing you when you come back.

After talking with the wait staff and chefs, these guys are always on the look out for new menu items to add and improve their menu."}
{"text":"We've driven by this place a few times and mentioned wanting to go, so this Sunday we made it happen. There was a little bit of wait but it wasn't too long. We sat down and were immediately greeted. I ordered the cookie butter latte with soy milk and my boyfriend ordered a caramel macchiato. Mine was delicious. He didn't like his at all but the waitress happily offered another drink instead. He ordered the smores latte and liked it much better. 

For our meals, he had the waffle, eggs and turkey bacon. He really liked it, especially the potatoes. I had the veggie crepe with cheddar cheese instead of goat cheese (and no hummus). Now, when I ordered it, I had a ton of hesitation just because it is unlike things I normally order. However, I was blown away! The garlic oil drizzled on top was amazing. My boyfriend also really liked it, which says a lot because he typically likes meals full of meat. The only thing that was just ok to me were the potatoes. Now, again my boyfriend really liked them. I thought they were tasty, but I wish they were served at a warmer temperature. 

Overall, it was really good. We will return."}
{"text":"Overall not likely to be returning - service, food and comfort left something to be desired. If you read some of my other reviews you'll find I usually will give props where due

Service - greeted at the door and handed menus before being seated; 5-10 minutes before server comes to the table (host did check and follow up) then another 5-10 for water

Food - over seasoned and kind of disappointing because the buckwheat crepe was quite tasty; my herbed goat cheese/chicken/spinach crepe was over seasoned with herbs; other half's apple and Brie with onion marmalade was mostly cinnamon apples with 5-6 small pieces of Brie he barely found and strings of cooked onion (definitely not a marmalade) - there were so many apples it should have been a dessert crepe.

Comfort - not sure if the AC wasn't working or it got too hot; the front door was open and the restaurant was a little warm as a result"}
{"text":"I have visited Crispy Crepe two times so far and enjoyed both. It's not a very large restaurant so seating could be an issue during peak times.  With that being said, they are only open for breakfast and lunch, no dinner!  

Since everything is freshly made to order, be patient with the amount of time it takes for your food to come out.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish they were open later and the prices aren't low, but I understand it's because of the quality that is put into it... I do appreciate a good crepe though!

They do offer gluten free crepes for those who prefer it."}
{"text":"This place is sooo yummy! I got the brushetta crepe, and it was out of this world amazing. One of my friends got the Nutella crepe with strawberries which was of course amazing as well. They also give you a ton of food! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love the patio seating it's small but intimate. 
Fun fact: there's no alcohol sold here due to owner's decision BUT you can bring outside champagne and other a $10 pitcher of OJ and they'll bring you champagne glasses. There's a CVS across the street that's we did. I had the chipotle chicken savory crepe with potatoes yum! Also tried the hummus and bruschetta flat bread which I definitely recommend getting.Cassie was our waitress she's was patient we had a needy group lol . Definitely recommend and will be back!!"}
{"text":"My mouth waters just thinking about the strawberry and nutella crepe at Crispy Crepe! The parking deck is a bummer and there may be a short wait, but it is worth it! They have a variety of savory and sweet crepes and I've never been disappointed, though the strawberry and nutella is so good that it is hard to try something new!"}
{"text":"This is a place that you drive by and say I'll go there one day and then never do.. Because who doesn't like crepes? Well I'm telling you to give it a shot! I went once and got hooked! They have amazing hot drinks including a cookie butter latte. They have great breakfast crepes and most certainly wonderful dessert crepes. Before arriving I was already a huge fan of cookie butter and to see all the cookie butter inspired entrees I was in heaven! 

They have both inside and outside seating available. The restaurant is not the largest so seating is a little cramped if you are 5 people. If you go on a weekend there will probably be a little wait time but it's worth it. You're in SouthEnd so enjoy the neighborhood :) 

The wait staff was very helpful specially if it is your first time! They provided helpful hints and also offered us to go drinks on the way out! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Holy good crepe!  This place is pretty freakin good.

It's tucked in a little corner off of S. Blvd and is not that noticeable from the street.  I wouldn't have randomly stopped by here and only knew of this place because some coworkers told me about it.  

Crispy Crepe has a good amount of tables, and also have some couches, but I would recommend sitting at the tables so it would be easier to eat.  I thought it was great that the tables all had a touch of a real flower in a small vase.  Made it feel nice inside.

Their menu has different variety, but not too much to overwhelm you with what you should choose.  I decided to get the Mediterranean Chicken, and man o man did I make the right choice!  The food was good, and not at a bad price either.  I'm sure I could have watched them make my food as they have a big glass where you can view them making the crepes, but I wanted to score a seat at a table before it started getting too busy.

The only reason this place lost a star is because with their parking, I had to park at a meter and parallel parking is not my forte.  I plan on going back one day and getting a dessert crepe to fulfill my sweet tooth needs."}
{"text":"Crepes are absolutely on point and the coffee is simply phenomenal. One of the best creperies we've been to in a LONG time. If you're in the area definitely stop in."}
{"text":"The food was good. We went with another couple and tried several dishes. The staff were friendly as well. Why I'm giving this a two is because there was so much smoke in this little quaint restaurant that our eyes were burning and watering throughout the whole meal. We actually rushed through our meal so that we could leave. Due to the smoke we smelled like food all day. There definitely needs to be better ventilation. Especially because the place is small."}
{"text":"Went on a sunny day and sat outside. Ordered chipotle chicken and salmon, egg and goat cheese crepes. Both crepes were big portion. Both crepes were okay. The crepe dough was little thick to me though. Also wish there were more cream on the top of the crepes. The side dishes that came with potato with cheese and fresh salad. Potato was good and salad was fresh. The server was attentive and the food was good but not a wow-level. 3 and a half star for this experience!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised the rating isn't higher, this place was fantastic! I had the Cookie Butter Latte, which was divine, and the S'mores N More crepe. My crepe was delicious. It's a good thing we were just visiting Charlotte because I could myself eating there way too often if I lived nearby :)."}
{"text":"I survived college partially on a diet of strawberry-nutella crepes, so I wanted to give this place a shot. I went for Brunch by myself on a Sunday and it was a pretty mixed bag. I might have been more forgiving if they opened pretty recently...?

Pros:
1. I snagged a spot in the garage behind the building - there are some reserved spots for this restaurant specifically, for one hour.
2. I immediately got seated outside, and when the sun came out (and some other people left) they indulged my request to move to another table under 1 of their 2 umbrellas.
3. Due to their slow service, they brought me a side of fruit and didn't charge me for my tea (I happened to notice it on my check, they didn't point it out to me). 
4. I had the Apple Streusel Crêpes and it was DELICIOUS. Seriously. The chocolate covered strawberry was a bonus, but I housed that whole freaking thing. It was a meal in & of itself.

Cons:
1. I sat for 10+ minutes before I was approached by a waitress. My entire meal (1 savory crepe for 1 person + iced tea) took 1.5 hours.  I don't know if they're not used to having an outside section since it's been rainy? I assume they're the same level of busy every Sunday.
2. My waitress, Ariel, was not at all friendly. I wouldn't go as far as rude, and I would love to make an excuse for her as it seemed hectic, but I never got told the specials, had to ask for tea refills, and generally felt like I was putting her out somehow.

Overall, I would go back to explore more of their menu, but probably not sitting outside (which sucks, I love to bring my dog and eat outside).
I have heard a few other comments from friends (which put the craving in my head!) that some of the menu items are definitely misses.  Mine was hit so it gets 3 stars!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time and set quite the first impression! I ordered the Pecorino Chicken and my sisters ordered the Bruschetta and the Bacon Egg and Cheddar. These three crepes were awesome! The size of these were larger than your traditional crepes. I would definitely come back and I would definitely refer people here! This place was great!"}
{"text":"Yummy waffles and other goods including smoothies and of course, the namesake crêpes. The interior is sleek and yet very welcoming and the service is prompt. I ordered a banana butterscotch (I think it was) waffle to dine in and also a smoothie to go, and the waffle came out promptly whereas, per my instuctions, the smoothie was ready when I was ready to leave the restaurant myself. I think they have a variety of salads and other lunch goodies on the menu, but the waffles are something else. More like a dessert nearly than a proper breakfast, and certainly not something the cardiologist will approve of, but very very very yummy. 

And sometimes that's exactly all that really matters."}
{"text":"Didn't love it, didn't hate it.  I truly want to support this place and give them credit for their efforts.  We tried the tomato, basil and mozzarella crepe and added chicken.  It came with a generous-sized side item.  It was good.  I've had crepes where they are crunchy but this was more soggy and it required a fork.  It was like a big, greasy, doughy mess by the time I was half way in.  Just not the best in my opinion.

I didn't try any of the sweet crepes but they had quite a selection and a couple of them seem worth a 2nd try.  I won't hoof it over here again just to visit crispy crepe but if I'm in the area I am not opposed to giving them another shot."}
{"text":"Sweet and savory crepes. Best of both worlds. Not huge selection but they do have a decent variety. A bit on the pricey side, but the quality and filling for almost all their items are premium.

Also, you can see them make your crepe (which I always find entertaining)"}
{"text":"5/9/2013-  Terrible Service and food!
We had the waitress who wore the hot pink lipstick.  After we were seated took hot pink, 25 minutes to come back to take our order.  I ordered the grilled marinated shrimp-just ok.  My husband ordered the lamb sandwich, next remove the fat and use more meat and the flatbread was stale.  This was not worth the one hour and twenty minutes.  We will never come back again and would not recommend the to anyone.   You are over rated.  Yuck! 
PS the free Thursday crepe dessert (apple streusel) was never served to us as ordered."}
{"text":"I have loved this place since they opened. My husband and I now consider ourselves crepe connoisseurs and go places in search of the best crepe! They have an array of sweet and savory delights to choose from, and I have never been disappointed!  I've had the Pecorino Chicken, the Apple Streusel Crepe, and the Chocolate Chip Cannoli and all three are delicious! The crepes taste delicate and the ingredients are very fresh!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Kind customer service. Clean. Fast service. Delicious latte. Best I've ever had. So much food, I couldn't eat it all. The herb chicken and goat cheese is yummmm. The savory crepe is so flavorful. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Crispy Crepe, however, I was so disappointed!!!!  I asked the server for recommendations, and i ordered her suggestion.  My entire family ordered so we had 5 crepes.  When I got my crepe, I thought it was terrible.  I told the server I didn't like the crepe, and she offered to get me something else.  Little did I know, I was being charged 1/2 for the crepe I sent back and full price for the replacement crepe - I was NOT informed of this when I placed another order.  I received my bill as I was starting to eat my second crepe as my entire family was finished with their food.  Once I saw the charge, I sent the other crepe back with only 2 bites taken and told them I would pay for none of them.  The manager stated she was sorry I was not told about paying for both crepes, but she didn't remove them from the bill.  Basically, I was being charged for 1.5 crepes and I took 3 bites total.  The second crepe was actually very good, but I sent it back on the principal that I should only have to pay for 1 crepe especially when I was not satisfied with the first one and the server was the one who recommended the crepe that was horrible.  After arguing, the manager removed both items from my bill.  I left the restaurant hungry and very unhappy.  I will never come back.   I have never heard of a restaurant trying to charge people for bad food that is sent back - it tells me that they don't stand behind their food which is crazy since that is their business.  Do not go to the Crispy Crepe!!!!!"}
{"text":"We have been here three times now and we have enjoyed each visit very much. The service is great and it is easy to find parking. We usual get one savory and one sweet crepe to split which is perfect. Love all of their crepes with eggs and the buckwheat crepes are really good and a great option if you are looking for something on the health side. We haven't tried any of their waffles but they look awesome."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our brunch this Sunday. Arriving right in the middle of the rush, it was a surprisingly short wait. The tables turn over quickly here!

Even though they have tons of other stuff - sandwiches, waffles, salads - there are two pages of crepes on the menu - one of savories and one of sweets. Tough to choose!

After our waiter brought us two swimming pool sized cups of coffee, we chose one sweet crepe (the Apple Streusel) and one savory (the Crispy, which is cheese stuffed). Both took a little bit to be prepared, during which the coffee was refilled. Good coffee, btw. Even though they have lattes and cappuccinos and other 'elite' coffees, you can't go wrong with a cup of Joe here.

Both plates arrived looking excellent as you can see from the pictures. The apple crepe was massive and quite sweet. The \"Crispy crepe\" was excellent. Tons of cheese and lots of flavor. I think I made out better for having that one. Oh, and the side of potatoes? Heavenly!

Plenty of parking in the parking deck behind the restaurant or on the street if you can find it."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places that I have been to in Charlotte. The crepes are huge and delicious! My friend got a savory crepe and I got a Mediterranean crepe which was amazing! We had a large party. We  just left a 5k walk and were starving. We were taken care of quickly. The server was great... Bottom line, I will be returning to this place again..."}
{"text":"I thought the food here was really good. The menu is quite extensive, so it took me a while to decide (who doesn't love crepes?) The waiter suggested the bruschetta crepe, and it didn't disappoint. I also got a creme brûlée late which was completely delicious! I didn't give myself enough time to enjoy this, since I arrived an hour before they were closing.

I wanted to try a sweet crepe, but it was way too much food. I'll have to go back even though a \"pick two\" or \"half-and-half\" option would be amazing.

The setting was okay. It is nicely decorated, but the vibe is lacking. I went later in the day, so it may be different during the peak brunch time."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant today with a friend who had been wanting to go. I had never heard of this restaurant, but I was open to trying something new. We split three meals: a cookie butter waffle, the smoked salmon crepe w/fruit, and a cheese omelet w/ potatoes. We were greeted by a male waiter. He asked us if we were ready to order even though we had just gotten there. Since we'd never been there he took our drink orders and left. He brought me a sweet tea that looked like cloudy apple juice. It tasted like it was old. And again he asked if we were ready to order even though much time hadn't passed. We told him we weren't ready to order and he tried to rush us by asking if we wanted to know his favorites. But I didn't ask for his input. I wanted to continue to look. But he offered his opinion, and we quickly decided on those 3 items. He went to put the order in and we didn't see him again till the food came. I informed him that the tea wasn't good and instead of saying \"I'm sorry about that, let me get you something else,\" he told me \"Oh yeah it did look kinda weird when I brought it.\" So we got out food. The cheese omelet was good, not hard to mess up. The potatoes reminded me of mashed potatoes though. The salmon crepe was not as creamy as I expected, which is what I expected from an entree with goat cheese. The eggs and salmon in the crepe were both over cooked. The cookie butter waffle was really good. It would have been better if my drink had been refilled because it was very sweet, but my waiter was outside socializing while I went without  he finally refilled it, but I was ready to leave and my friend was too. She waiter gave us our checks, picked them up AND asked us if we needed change. Uhhhh...YES I DO I WAS THIRSTY WHILE YOU WENT OUTSIDE AND THEN CAME BACK IN AND STOOD IN THE KITCHEN DIRECTLY ACROSS FROM MY TABLE AND LAUGHED AND TALKED. I work hard for my $ and I truly want it back. Such a damper in a beautiful day."}
{"text":"Great and huge crepe! I ordered ahead and took out, so no idea about the wait/atmospher of the resteraunt, but the food was nice and the homemade chips good and crispy as well!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

We came here with a groupon yesterday for lunch. We were quickly seated and given waters right away. Everything looked good so I went with the chipotle chicken while the bf ordered the Mediterranean chicken crepe. Crepes are a little over 10 bucks here, kinda pricey. Crepes came out fast and wow, they are big. We should have split one. The Au gratin side was Delish! I was disappointed to find the chipotle chicken was very bland. I didn't even get a hint of chipotle. But, everything was fresh! The Mediterranean chicken was so bomb though! The sauce included in this is so flavorful! Some chicken pieces felt off and a little chewy. Had to box up both crepes, they were so big we couldn't finish! 

We will be back for more, but, well be splitting a savory and getting a sweet. The cookie butter sounded enticing. Having a crepe to yourself is just too much food. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great brunch spot! I ordered the Herb Ricotta Cheese and Spinach crepe and had no regrets. The vibe is laidback and cheerful, and service was awesome. Lots of coffee options too. If you're super hungry and debating whether it's worth a 30 minute wait for brunch, it is.

Also, they were great about accommodating shellfish allergies."}
{"text":"Didn't get any crepes based on the 45-minute wait, but our food ended up taking around 30-minutes regardless. Has the turkey bacon/egg croissant and a waffle platter. Seating was pretty limited."}
{"text":"Crispy Crepe is in the heart of the South End (one of my favorite areas in Charlotte) and I am a sucker for outdoor seating.  My bestie and I thought we'd try something new so Crispy Crepe it was.  I was really excited after reviewing the menu, but I couldn't decide if I wanted sweet or savory so I ordered the Smoked salmon, egg and herb goat cheese Crepe and my friend ordered the Cookie Butter Waffle and we split each dish to satisfy our palette.  The food was delicious HOWEVER the service was not the best.  We chose to sit outside since it was a beautiful day. The waitress was prompt in coming to our table, explaining the menu and the food arrived to our table in a timely manner.  Towards the end of our meal, another waitress arrives to our table and aggressively says \"So are you guys ready for your check or what?\"  I was a little taken back by her tone and the fact that she was coming to our table without announcing why she was coming to our table at all.  It gave me the impression that she was rushing us and not to mention she was rude.  I guess my expression said everything because she quickly corrected herself explaining that our waitress was occupied and sent her over to ask if we were ready for our checks.  I think it's important to teach your staff the importance of tone and delivery.  It's not what you say but how you say it.  That one incident partially spoiled my overall brunch experience...nevertheless the food was good and I still recommend trying Crispy Crepes."}
{"text":"A coworker of mine told me to check out this place and I will definitely be going back. I went with a friend and we got two crepes. One was the goat cheese and chicken crepe and the other was the chipotle chicken. The goat cheese was my favorite crepe. I was nervous about it possibly being dry but it has just the right about of goat cheese. The chipotle chicken was good but had a lot going on inside the crepe. After a few bites I ended up picking just the chicken out because it was too much"}
{"text":"2.5 stars here.  It's not terrible, but the value just isn't there. I gave this place two tries and I was really excited for it opening, but I was not really impressed with it.

I am not a crepe connoisseur, but the crepes were very doughy and heavy, rather than thin.  Also, there was not much flavor to the breakfast crepe I had.

After trying the crepe, I tried their Liege waffle.  Unfortunately, that too was very doughy and left me not feeling that well.  (I did enjoy the bonus chocolate covered strawberry, though)

The #1 downside of this place are their high PRICES.  I would not mind the food being mediocre, but the prices are very high for the quality you get.  I think I am done with this place for now until someone persuades me to return.

For now, if I want crepes, I will keep going back to Hazelnuts Creperie."}
{"text":"Just the Best!!

Food is scrumptious and savory, the coffee is heavenly & the service is outstanding! There is tons of options, from breakfast to sandwich style to desserts. They have an outdoor patio too!

Our server Joe F. was always checking on us, making sure we were happy, comfortable and well taken care of - go Joe!"}
{"text":"I had a waffle there and it was good, but what I really didn't like that ventilation inside was very bad. As soon as I entered the restaurant there was a smog in the air, after sitting inside for a half an hour I stank. The waitress was very pleasant and checked on us a few times and made sure we got everything we need."}
{"text":"I am a bit partial to my go-to crepe place in Matthews, but had to give this place a shot since it is within easy walking distance to my new place.  Usually when I drive by, there is a crowd waiting to be seated, so naturally I had already hyped this place up for myself.

Expecting a crowd, I was pleasantly surprised there was no wait and the place was busy, but not busting at the seams (like I had grown accustomed to seeing on my drive-bys).  It probably had something to do with the frigid cold temps that morning... but it was our gain.

The menu looked super-delicious, probably cause I had just ran 9 miles in the morning so I was ready to eat!  Had their Bacon, Egg, and waffle platter and was pretty happy with what I got.  The turkey bacon was super tasty, the eggs perfectly cooked - maybe wished for some bread to soak up the yolk... instead I used part of my waffle, and the waffle was a unique doughy texture (in a good way).

Our server was on point!  Always refilling out coffee cups and checking on us to make sure we were okay.  

I wasn't completely blown away, but I will definitely go back.  Something about the room being fairly smoky (from a previously burned food item- I am guess) and then the craziness... or lack-there-of in the kitchen.  Since it is open, I saw a lot of folks waiting for something to do.  I think what happened is that they were anticipating a usual Saturday crowd, but the weather keeping people in, gave the staff more presence in the restuarant than customers."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, warm and inviting.  I had the Chipotle Chicken Crepe.  It was absolutely delicious.  It had the appropriate amount of seasoning and spice.  The Potato Au Gratin was AMAZING!  I ended my meal With a Chai Tea Latte, it was warm and delicious.  I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I love any opportunity to brunch it up, and Crispy Crepe was a slam dunk on a Saturday. We walked in around 10:30am and was seated right away, which was wonderful; we expected a crowd.
I'm a big fan of crepes and was delighted to see a large selection of both savory and sweet options. I settled on the Smoked Salmon crepe. It was delicious  and very large. It's served with a cheese potato hash( the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the hash needs salt, pepper and love). The portions are large so if you're into sharing you could potentially share one crepe or get a savory crepe and a sweet crepe and split it between two people if you wanted to try more things on the menu.

Prices were reasonable for brunch and the service was great. Will definitely be back next time in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This amazing brunch spot has it all!

It has a wide variety of drinks to choose from. A lot of specialty coffees that will bring me back to try the next kind. I ordered a s'more latte. It was very good! It came with toasted marshmallows with graham crackers sprinkled above the coffee. My girlfriend liked it so much she basically took it from me. 

I got the chocolate peanut butter waffle. It was amazing. The waffle is made in house and is thick and full bodied. It had chocolate peanut butter treats drizzled on top of it. The only thing I regretted was getting that with the smore latte. That was a lot of sugar for me but I wanted to try both. They also have a wide variety of crepes that are not sweet but savory. I had a bit of my girlfriends crepe and it was delicious. 

The service was great. Our server was very personable and offered suggestions and suggested  us her favorite dishes. Great experience!"}
