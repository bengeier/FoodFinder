{"text":"This places was an OK spot on the Place Jacques-Cartier for a quick-ish lunch.  We walked up and down the Place looking for a restaurant and this seemed to be the only one open before noon that wasn't also insanely expensive or exclusively seafood.  We were the only customers and that was fine with us.  

The service was OK and the menu was kind of large.  The beer specials were decent (including American and Canadian craft brews) and they had a lot of sandwiches available for lunch.  I can't remember what I ordered first but they didn't have the item so I was disappointed and went with an underwhelming sandwich instead.  My husband liked his sandwich so it kind of evened out.  The corned beef was OK so I'd never order it again but maybe other people would think it tasted better... who knows.

I could see this place getting worse as traffic increases since there weren't too many servers available and they have evening drink specials which may take up the time of other waitstaff.  All in all, a totally mediocre place in a super touristy area of Old Montreal.  Not anything to write home about but good enough to stop again.  Outdoor seating in the summer/fall... definitely a huge plus!"}
{"text":"Quick service good poutine and you can't go wrong with Stella Artois on draft in a chalice. We sat down to wait twenty minutes while an artist finished a painting for us."}
{"text":"This place is a block from the old port of Montreal on a huge tourist area (which I equate to Montreal's version of Times Square).  This place features al fresco dining is right near the port, so it's popular (most likely due to location).

The menu is focused but a bit confused.  They serve pasta, French Canadian food and American fare all on the same menu.  No specials the day we went.  The pulled duck poutine was good and not overly heavy.  Seafood risotto (it says linguine in English but this was a print error) was too creamy and the rice was undercooked.  If you can't make risotto, you shouldn't.  Shrimp were massive but the only other seafood in the dish was baby scallops.  A bit misleading.  The club sandwich was OK but probably a bit overpriced at 16 bucks (Canadian).  

All in all, the service here is pretty good, the place is nice and its located right in the middle of everything.  Food is average and a bit pricy so it's one thumb up."}
{"text":"Came here after a great afternoon in the Old Port in Montreal. My boyfriend and I got a pitcher of sangria and a plate of nachos, it was all amazing and just the perfect combination!!

The service was stellar, we had our server recommend places for us to visit while in town and gave us a great list of places, he was really nice.

I honestly can't wait to be back in Montreal and will defiantly be returning here. Nachos and sangria were great and the price was reasonable!!

Merci Montreal!"}
