{"text":"Finally a new salad place in montreal.
I like this place so fresh and full of life.
Staff is super friendly and knowledgable.
I have tried most of there salads but my favourite is the blt helper.
I also tried there soups which you can custom make.
My favourite soup is the beef broth with chars and bacon.
Next time I'm there I will try the wraps.

I even took one home for my lunch.

Give Hillary salad a try and you will thank me later"}
