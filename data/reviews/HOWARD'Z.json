{"text":"My 87 yr old mother and I love the Philly Cheese Steak!  Comfortable, casual and friendly.  We'll be back; however, the restaurant is not very wheelchair friendly."}
{"text":"The philly is delicious, they give you a ton of fries and the owner makes your day every time you come in.  If you are looking for a true philly that isn't overpriced, then Howard'z is your place.  The atmosphere and location are perfect and is very kid friendly.  You will not be disappointed.   Howard'z is the Jewel of downtown Concord."}
{"text":"Best Philly streaks in the south!!!! Good prices and great personality! Food is good sized. And the meatloaf burger.....so good."}
{"text":"What can I say? This is the best cheesesteak in NC! The bread is delicious and just melts in your mouth. The meat is juicy and full of flavor. The bread and meat come straight from Philly and you can tell. The owner was very gracious and personable. If you are within 30 minutes of Concord then you need to come here to eat. Unbelievable food with unbelievable staff. Thank you Howard'z for the great food and hospitality."}
{"text":"Two words \"Mumbo Sauce\" I love how engaged the owners are and they make a habit or remembering their customers anytime I'm in downtown I make it a habit to frequent this restaurant. All their food is freshly made so it may take a moment to get but  They always take care of me and it's well worth the wait."}
{"text":"I am part of a family owned printing business in Downtown Concord, and there are quite a few places to eat that are good, and there are plenty of choices and price ranges on the cuisine side. I had a customer tell me how wonderful the restaurant's hamburgers were and he was right on. Flat out great burger. So, I thought the Burgers were the best thing about Howard'z, but the Philly Cheese Steak is to die for. I spent a year in Philly and I never had a better one there. This guy has my vote for the best Burger and Steak Sandwich in the area. certainly the best in Concord/ Kannapolis area. Find out the owner is from Philadelphia, PA, which explains the spectacular Cheese Steak."}
{"text":"Howard's is great! I especially love the salmon patty burger! I know, I was somewhat skeptical when a friend told me I \"had\" to order it. The salmon patty was cooked perfectly - a little crunch on the outside and the perfect texture on the inside. I ordered mine with lettuce, tomato, onions and pickles. Let me tell you it was amazing!
They cooked the shoestring french fries to order so they were piping hot and the perfect compliment to the burger."}
{"text":"Howard'z is a wonderful new restaurant in downtown Concord-- 11 Union St, just past the Chocolatier's (also wonderful!). It has a large, glassed in dining room, fun to see the world go by as you have your meal.  They make really delicious hamburgers, and even better meatloaf burgers.  But the shining star of the menu is the Philly Cheese steak!  Out of this world!  You can customize it with grilled onions, mushrooms, peppers, choice of cheese, etc.  please try this sandwich -- you will be an instant fan!
     The owners are indeed from Philly, but they are settling in and they love Concord.  Show them a little love in return and go eat there.  Soon.  Today!!!  Now.  You'll thank me for the recommendation!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Best Philly Cheesesteak in Charlotte and surrounding. The fries are delicious and crunchy too. My husband order a side of wings with their special sauce and it was absolutely delicious. The owners said all there steak and bread comes from philly. The owner is ver friendly and down to earth. This is definitely a staple restaurant for me. Make sure you stop by."}
{"text":"Very good Philly cheesesteak. Definitely not fancy, but great food and super friendly staff. Best place to grab a sandwich in downtown concord."}
{"text":"This place was chosen because of Yelp. And this place is awesome !! They say that most holes in the wall have the best food. This place definitely does ! And we made the trip from Charlotte ,NC. Go here you won't be disappointed !!"}
{"text":"The cheese steak is great, but the meatloaf burger is unbelievable. Now they have a salmon patty that rivals the meatloaf burger. Just keeps getting better!!"}
{"text":"They are legit, Philly family! They have vegetarian options too. We had the veggie sub and a salmon burger and they were so good. They have the right rolls too. Nice family run spot that has the Philly cheesesteak shop vibe. Place an order and grab a seat. It's not supposed to be fancy, it's supposed to be Philly. Go and get the experience if you don't know. Good food and great people."}
{"text":"True gem.  Great food, and even better service.  Worth the drive to eat a cheesesteak."}
{"text":"After reading the mixed reviews I decided to give this place a try. Upon entering I noticed 1 other customer that was on the way out. I placed my order of a philly cheesesteak with onions & provolone. The to-go order was ready in about 7 minutes. Overall, the flavor was good.  The meat was seasoned well, with enough moisture. However, the sandwich was riddled with small pieces of inedible gristle! ! I could not get through the first half of the sandwich there was so much of this stuff in it. In addition to that, I also felt that the bread was a little to soft for a true philly. Too bad. I really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"They have closed the Concord location but there is a news article dated August 3, 2016 that says they have moved to a Gastonia location( but are not yet open)."}
{"text":"Nestled in the the center of Downtown Concord lies this hidden gem. The authenticity of their Philly cheese steaks is fantastic. I can tell that a lot of love is put into making the sandwiches, and I can appreciate someone that wants to keep something their city is known for as authentic as possible. I'm pretty sure the place is ran by people who are originally from Philly. Very nice people. I will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Now this is a cheese steak!! I'm from Philly this is good!!! way better than jersey mikes in Huntersville the family are good people!! even though he is a Dallas cowboys fan!! lol"}
{"text":"Awesome staff! But I was a little underwhelmed with the sandwich I ordered. If I have more time next time I will get the fries and actually eat in instead taking it to go."}
{"text":"Saw the reviews and decided to try Howardz. The cheesesteak was awesome!   I have been trying to find a good cheesesteak in Concord and have finally found it.   It isn't anything fancy inside and the menu is not large but the food was great and you get tons of food.  The employees were so nice and made sure everything was to our satisfaction.   Can not wait to go again!  Great job guys!"}
{"text":"I so wanted to love the place. I love local restaurants in downtown areas. That's why I'm so disappointed to write this review. First time I drove by the place had a line out the doors and I think that demand just made my anticipation grow for a qualify cheesesteak. 

Steak Cheesesteak 2 stars-Just meh. No real flavor. Even the over cooked saut√©ed vegetables had no flavor. Had to Doctor it up mayo and hot sauce just to get it down. 

Cleanliness 2 stars-looks like the owners and the staff just don't care. Light bulbs out. Drink cooler 80% empty. Drink machine not functioning."}
{"text":"WOW. I cannot say enough about how awesome this place is! As someone who grew up where Philly Cheesesteaks were a way of life, I have found it difficult to find authentic cheesesteaks since moving to the south. When I saw the reviews for Howard'z, I knew I had to try it. I was NOT disappointed! I call this place a little \"hole in the wall\" as a term of endearment but everyone knows that's where you get the best food! The cheesesteaks are absolutely to die for. I only wish I lived closer because I would literally eat here every day. The staff is very personable and friendly too so that's always a plus! I could sit here and write all day about how great this place is, but you just can't comprehend it until you try it yourself...so get to Concord and get yourself a Philly Cheesesteak from Howard'z and you can see why there are so many people on Yelp raving about their food!"}
{"text":"Found this gem on yelp, and we are so glad we gave it a try! Amazing Philly cheese steaks, probably the best i've ever had! The southern hospitality from the owners made it perfect!"}
{"text":"Best cheesesteak I've had in a long time! Just like the ones you get in Philadelphia. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"This place lives up to the hype on Yelp. Excellent authentic Philly cheesesteaks on the perfect hoagie. French fries were crispy and the portion was huge. Will definitely make this my go to cheesesteak place. Highly recommended!"}
