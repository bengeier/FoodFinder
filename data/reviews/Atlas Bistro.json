{"text":"Fantastic food.  Decent service.  The location leaves something to be desired."}
{"text":"WOW! This place is awesome! My girlfriends and I came to Atlas Bistro on a Saturday night and we couldn't stop talking about how amazing it was. The food was delicious. Seriously, some of the best food I've ever had. The atmosphere was quaint and fun, and the service was terrific. I loved the somewhat unique dishes. They were different than your normal menu, but not so different that you didn't really want to try much. They also accommodated the various allergies at our table of 9 lades. I just wish I had taken a to-go bag of my scallops!"}
{"text":"It's funny, reading down these reviews I really don't have much to add. I think it's best summed up by Nicki H. Starting with bubbly and moving into a nice red you will never go wrong at Atlas. Hey, even if you do want that white its only 20 feet away! 

Definitely call ahead. 

Seriously, pound for pound and what you get for your money it is the best date spot in Scottsdale. You feel exclusive in small space which is a turn on to most. I say go immediately, or as soon as you can get a reservation."}
{"text":"My wife and I, along with another couple sat down in Atlas for a culinary adventure. We opted for the Chef's Choice Tasting menu. Which is a euphemism for \"Whatever strikes Chef's fancy this particular day\".   We called a day early to find out which wines to bring since, among the other attractions for AB, it is a BYOB establishment. We decided to bring a variety since the menu hadn't been set.
Good thing, because Chefs Joshua \"Lefty\" Reisner and Keenan Bosworth really pulled out all the stops for us. We wound up enjoying 12 different courses. Yep, four hours and 12 courses later we walked out with our heads spinning from the intense culinary assault. This is the third or fourth time my wife and I have done the Chef's Choice menu. We've had as many as fourteen courses and as few as 9. 
Ha, as \"few\" as nine courses.

Some of the high points from Saturday night:
Second Course
Applewood Smoked Idaho Trout
Mizuna and English Cucumber
Things Chef Joshua Pickeled

Fourth Course
Sundowner Day Boat Santa Barbara Sea Bass
Grilled Baby Octopus
Bagna Cauda and Fried Capers

Sixth Course
Crispy Korobuta Pork Belly
White Bean Puree
Bourbon Glazed Apricots

Twelfth Course
Hudson Valley Foie Gras
Vanilla Pound Cake and Apricot Jam
Minus 8 Vinegar

These guys are fearless in the kitchen. If you ever thought it would be interesting to let someone create a gastronomic adventure for you, Atlas Bistro is the place you're looking for."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and presentation was just amazing. Plus it's a BYOB restaurant connected to an amazing wine store. If you check in on Yelp they even waive the corkage fee."}
{"text":"My husband brought me here for Valentine's Day dinner, and I am beyond glad that he did. It's one of those places that only the hip locals know about. It's off the beaten path, and is literally a hole in the wall, conjoined with a wine bar, which is the coolest thing ever because you can purchase your wine from this massive selection and then step right in to this little bistro, where your dining is the experience. Every, single course was absolutely amazing. The service was superb, my wine glass was never empty. Todd was very knowledgable, charming and obviously takes great pride in his restaurant. I've had the pleasure of eating at various establishments, but in all of my years of dining experiences, this was by far the best. I honestly cannot emphasis the beautiful and skillfully prepared culinary masterpieces that I had the ultimate pleasure of consuming, and just how delectable each plate, each bite truly was. I am taking my parents here when they come to visit. It has got to be Arizona's best kept secret. Definitely a must!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in town recently and we happened to stumble upon AZ Wine Company. We thought it odd that what seemed to be a nice little wine store was so quietly tucked back in the back of grubby back alley with no real signage to speak of indicating its presence in the complex. We browsed the aisles for about 15 minutes and were impressed with the Italian wine selections but severely disappointed in the Pinots. 

Needless to say, we selected a lovely bottle of Pinot Grigio to take back to our hotel room with us.. While we were checking out, we took note of Atlas Bistro next door, perused the menu laid out by the door, and decided we'd have to come back later that day for a glass of wine followed by dinner. 

We were so incredibly disappointed. Not only were we made to wait an astounding 45 minutes (apparently, not a rare occurrence) before we were able to get a table, but the bottle of wine recommended to us by the 'owner' was overpriced and corked. The food was alright, but the service was stilted and rude. We found the overall experience repugnant and will not be returning. Far better fare and service can be found at other, nearby spots (see Pig & Pickle)."}
{"text":"I'm sure the food is good. The presentation of everything was very nice. However, it's not a good place for vegetarians. The only thing on the menu without meat was the cheese plate. I ordered the gnocchi without the short rib and it was extremely salty. I suspect they added extra salt to make up for the flavor lost from the meat. The wine bar next door looks nice and the wine store has a large selection. I'm sure I'll return for that."}
{"text":"The food is always awesome, Todd and Natasha are great."}
{"text":"What an amazing little place! Food is outstanding! Great dining experience! My husband and I celebrated our first wedding anniversary there and since then this restaurant is our favorite place"}
{"text":"We had dinner here this past week based on all the good reviews. Our food was good but not outstanding. We had duck, steak and salmon entrees. The duck was probably the best and the steak was fair at best. The cheese plate appetizer was excellent. Service was very good. We will give this place another try before making a final judgement."}
{"text":"Truly Great restaurant. If your into accomplished intricate flavors this place rocks. Love the wine store next door. We go every time we're in town"}
{"text":"Great place for those who love the wine and food culture!  Went there for a wine pairing dinner and came out thoroughly educated about the wines that were served."}
{"text":"Service is excellent and the food is among the best in the city. The only negative I might see for a big eater is that the portions are small, but hey, this is fine dining and I'm certain we all eat too much as it is."}
{"text":"Best place in Arizona! The food is unparalleled and the service is top notch. If recommend this to anyone coming or living in phx/Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Updating to report that we did in fact try again, for a 4th time, to eat here, on April 30th for my bf's birthday. Called to try to make a reservation, no answer. Showed up and the guy in the wine store said they'd been closed for weeks preparing for a special event. This it's pretty ridiculous. I just feel like if you're going to be closed during normal business hours you could at least put something on the answering machine or website indicating such. It appears the only way to eat here is one of these special events. Don't think we'll waste our time again."}
{"text":"We went here last night and it was amazing.  As a Phoenix native, I have eaten at a lot of the better restaurants in the metro Valley.  It is safe to say that Atlas is at least a step, if not three, better than any other restaurant in the Valley and is, in itself, a destination. The food quality is magnificent and the presentation is inspired.  Within the presentation is a playfulness and creativity that lets the consumer be part of the process.  Each dish has a number of sauces and complimentary food items within in it, presented in most unusual ways.  Thus as one is eating, they can combine the different elements of the dish with the sauces, creating an evolving food experience. So a basic fois gras dish becomes a living art piece that includes hazelnut granola, pears, dates... plus a variety of perfected sauces drawn throughout the physical plate. Combinations I never knew would be good together but Atlast somehow marries the improbable to make it probable and awesome.    I am ecstatic to have found this place.  This is a place that is above and beyond any other restaurant I have been to. And as a self-taught home cook, I appreciate the ability to be served such original food-I was looking for a place that cooks better than me and for food I could never do at home because it would be too complicated. I hit the jackpot with Atlas.  And for all that I found the price more than reasonable. One of best things is after the meal was done, I actually felt nourished.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"How did it take us so long to find this amazing hidden gem? Truly one of the best restaurants the Phoenix area has to offer. Absolutely stunning meal. We can't wait to go back! Highly recommend to anyone who appreciates the art of food. Plus you can't beat a place where you can bring your own wine or choose from their expansive inventory at the wine shop it's connected to."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! The food was the best food I've ever experienced. Every bite was so decadent. The staff was beyond wonderful and incredibly knowledgeable about the courses and wine selections. Very quaint place, but that helps make the experience that much more intimate. I loved atlas bistro and can't wait to go back. Chef's Juan and Corey are unbeatable."}
{"text":"Well, there are plenty of places with great food in the Phoenix area, this being one of them.  But customer service will kill a great food experience as has happened for me at Atlas Bistro.  Made a reservation for 12 during restaurant week, confirmed the day before.  When we arrived a table for 8 was set up and the remaining 4 of us had to wait nearly an hour to be added to the rest of our group.  We'd purchased wine next door at AZ Wine so started with that yet were offered no bread or snacks while we waited, much less an apology that our party was separated like this for nearly an hour of a confirmed reservation time.  Totally awkward for the 8 diners inside waiting to order/eat and the 4 of us outside the door waiting to get in.

We were seated in a tight center table with one end being near the kitchen door and the owner, then the manager got in to an altercation with one member of our group causing the entire restaurant to witness this \"scene' involving yelling and physical pushing.   The owner physically pushed his chair out of the way while he was sitting in it claiming in an angry tone that this diner had \"been in the way all night\".  I sat right across from this man and never saw him move his chair out of it's assigned spot (way too close to the kitchen door but where the restaurant located it) until the very end of the evening, after the check had been paid and most diners vacated the restaurant.  He had moved his chair to the end of the table to pose for a photo. 

After he was ejected from the restaurant, everyone in our group was humiliated, asked not to come back due to this altercation regarding one member at our table even though everyone else remaining had no idea what had even occured, much less been involved in it.  \"Unfortunately his behavior reflects on all of you and you are not welcome to come back here again\" we were told.  We were treated like lesser human beings I suppose because we had the audacity to come in during Restaurant Week and pay a reduced amount.  Clearly the restaurant was not equipped to handle a group that large, was burnt out after a week of Restaurant Week diners and took it out on the entire group.  They should have been embarassed at their own behavior publicly like that.

Little did they know this group was a small representation of a 1000+ member group, The Arizona Winebats, which just won Phoenix New Times \"Best of Phoenix\" award for their wine social group.  And they burned every member of this group with this behavior tonite.  And every member's family /friends.  Not very smart in this economic climate.  No good food (which it was/is good food there) will make up for that kind of poor customer service.

Also as a side note, a restaurant never knows when they are serving to a person who is personal friends with a big restaurant critic in town and who goes dining at various restaurants with said friend/critic while she is doing reviews.  That would be the case with this incident.

I'll take my dollars to Total Wines and tried and true like Barrio Cafe and Digestif or NOCA,  thank you.  Atlas shrugged indeed."}
{"text":"I hate to review a place after only one visit, but for the price I don't feel that bad. The service and the presentation of the food was excellent. Except I did show up before someone else who seemed like a regular and got sat after, but minor issue. The problem was the food. It was just so salty! I felt like I was eating a Mountain House freeze dried meal. Those things are pretty good after spending the whole day hiking, but didn't expect it from a fancy restaurant. Everything we ate we couldn't really taste because of all the salt. It did seem like a lot of regulars there who loved the place, but I do not plan on going back anytime soon. I did overhear it was a new chef so maybe that was the issue. Luckily the free Yelp corkage coupon is accepted!"}
{"text":"Before you read this review I suggest you scroll down and read my original review on July 6, 2013. I raved about Atlas Bistro, gave it five stars and wrote, \"This is a little-known jewel of a restaurant. Highly recommended for special occasions.\" It was my favorite restaurant in all of Phoenix. How sad that now, after enjoying three superlative dinners there, I am forced to give it a mere two stars.

A new chef took over the kitchen at Atlas Bistro several months ago, and it is no longer the restaurant it once was. Each time when I  went there earlier they had a sublime appetizer, large beef marrow bones with crumbled lamb bacon - the kind of dish you could find nowhere else in Phoenix. Heavenly. Well, now with the new chef they don't offer it anymore, our waitress told us. Earlier I had heavenly entrees like an unequaled duck confit and melt-in-your-mouth short ribs. All banished from the menu. The portions were not large, but there was plenty to enjoy. I realize their menu changes from day to day based on available local foods, but it is now devoid of dishes of substance, like a duck leg or a short rib.

Now they offer a prix fixe menu that is so shi-shi, so devoid of substantive dishes, and with portions so infinitesimal that you could cry. I had the hangar steak as my entree and there were two tiny pieces of beef, each about the size of a half dollar. They were incredibly delicious. First rate. But why do I need to use a tweezers to find the meat on my plate? For the money, the portion was preposterously small.  My friend ordered the halibut, again a very small portion, and nothing to get excited about. One of the sides was supposed to be a lentil dish - there was only about a tablespoonful of lentils. Delicious, but gone in one forkful. The entire dinner was like that. The focus was on presentation, not on providing a real meal.

Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the food and very pleasant. But alas, even here the restaurant I loved the most was sorely disappointing. Before the meal began I showed the waitress my Yelp coupon for a free corkage. But when we got the bill we were still charged a $10 corkage fee. Plus, we had ordered the octopus appetizer which was $5 extra, but the waitress billed it for $25 extra! She corrected that, and we asked her to also remove the $10 corkage fee, and showed her the coupon again. Idiotically, I didn't look over the revised bill when she brought it out and it was only after I got home that I saw she never removed the $10 fee! For a restaurant where we spent more than $200 for two people, not including the wine, this was totally unacceptable. But what can I do? They got my extra $10.

It is truly heartbreaking for me to write this review. A once great restaurant has become so full of itself that I cannot go there again. And this was for a very special occasion. For a fraction of the cost I could have gone to Christo's or Tarbells' and had a real plate of food at a fair price. Alas, I have to bid farewell to what was once my favorite restaurant. What a disappointment. What a shame."}
{"text":"Best place to eat in PHX hands down!
 If you go just trust the chef and bring your favorite wines.. only BYOB in az with this quality of food. The owners are so amazing and accommodating. Do yourself a favor and give this place a try!"}
{"text":"3 course $50. Amazing. Place is so good. Service is not great but I continue to go back. Grab a bottle of wine on the way In at the adjacent wine shop as its byob"}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled across Atlas Bistro in a local magazine while on vacation.  It sounded interesting, so we figured we'd give it a try.  We are big wine lovers, and food is a close second.  
There are those who have complained about having to pay corkage on bottles they purchase from the wine store attached to Atlas.  They are attached, but not run by the same people.  It is purely a \"working relationship\" built around a great idea.  That being said, one could pay for a bottle in any restaurant around the country and fork over anywhere from 100%-200% mark up from retail for their wine of choice.  Having to fork out $10 per bottle for corkage is a way better alternative.
Anyway, what a find!  We chose the 4 course dinner to go with the 2 bottles of wine we brought with us.  The meal began with a smoked trout amuse bouche.  I am not a fish fan, but this was delicious.
For the first course I chose the pork belly and my husband selected the gnocchi.  Both were amazingly complex and confirmed our hope that Atlas could be the find of our trip.
The rest of the meal was equally as sublime, with every bite accompanied by \"mmm\" and \"this is so good\" as our mantras.
We had happened to meet the \"Cheese Nerd\" (as he is called by his peers) in the wine shop.  Do yourself a huge favor and order cheese at Atlas.  They take it very seriously.  Since both of us ordered the cheese course, \"Sir Queso\" selected 8 cheeses for us to enjoy.  They ranged from soft sheep/cow's milk cheese to a pungent water buffalo blue.  Having cheese at Atlas reminded us of our trips to France, where cheese is a religion. 
Our thanks to the chefs and Nolan and Todd who made our dinner a fantastic experience.  We will be back the next time we are in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"In a city of now you're open, now you're not, Atlas Bistro just quietly chugs along, reinventing itself whenever their chef gets hot pants to think he can do better elsewhere. And then Todd Sawyer reaches into his masterful bag of tricks and pulls another ace out of his waistband, never missing a beat, and continuing to improve. I double dog dare you to spend $55 anywhere else in this over hyped city, and eat the quality of food presented in a three choice, three course prix fixe option menu that changes often enough to keep repeat customers interested. Last night it was pork belly, lobster, waygu, duck. There's something for everyone. Mr Sawyer and his staff fly around the room attending to the every need of their customers. Their outrageously inexpensive corkage policy makes this THE destination for valley winos, no matter how many bottles you bring in. And we typically bring in a pants load. New glasses appear, old disappear, decanters managed. Six stars for service alone. Even if you're dumb enough to drink Rombauer and Yellow Tail, get your butt to Atlas. After all, the table next to you is likely drinking DRC, and you just might have a pour sent over to your table. I can't recommend Atlas Bistro more highly. Get there!"}
{"text":"I am an events director for a national magazine, we are based out of Dallas, TX and were hosting an executive dinner in Arizona...let me just say Todd and the staff phenomenal, on point! They took care of every last detail, which was very helpful to me since I couldn't be on site. Food was AMAZING! wine - perfection! wine glasses - accurate to type of wine! This place really knows what they are doing. Not only were we impressed but our local execs were blown away. This is a gem hidden in the desert, we will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Wow!  What an amazing find.  While I'm not a huge fan of the fixed price menu, it does wonders here.  The selections are basically what is available today from local sources.

The lobster, bisque and risotto appetizer is amazing and could easily be the best in town.  It makes Capitol Grill's seem like it came from a tin.

Scallops were dynamite as well.  Just order them if available.  

BYOB works wonders with Ridell glasswear.  

It's simply one of the best places in town."}
{"text":"I just had a wonderful evening at Atlas Bistro and I have to say that the food there is some of the best I have ever had.  Every thing I put into my mouth was delicious and very fresh, props to their chefs!  The atmosphere was great and the service was top notch and timely.   I also thought it was very unique and convenient having a wine store next door, a smart and convenient  partnership.  If you've thought about going to Atlas Bistro but haven't gotten around to it make reservations, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Hands down the best BYOB and restaurant in Scottsdale! I have never had a bad experience here! Todd does a wonderful job here and the service is always spot on! 

This is an amazing place for every occasion! I had my wedding reception here and I couldn't of asked for a better night! My
Guests still talk about my wedding night, and how good the food was. This is a place everyone should try, it really is exceptional. Any duck menu item is always one of my favorites!  I can't say enough positive things about this place!"}
{"text":"We took a chance on this place based on Yelp and it was awesome. Small place located in a strip mall. Don't bother bringing your own wine - there is an AMAZING wine shop next door with great prices. We showed up with 2 bottles we had just brought from a trip to Napa 2 days prior and ended up buying two others - favorites of ours that are pretty rare finds. Service was great too. Great find if you are looking for great food at a great value and like your wine."}
{"text":"We have been wanting try this great find for sometime but it always slipped our minds until I saw it on the restaurant week list.  Because they were so booked they extended restaurant week to the following weekend as well so I was able to get reservations and surprise my boyfriend for a great date night. The meal was a three course meal for $40 which to us was a bargain and for what you get!  We had the gnocchi appetizer and the Oregon Lobster Mushroom appetizer.  A new mushroom for us but won't be our last.  Every bite of both appetizers was very palate pleasing!  For the salad we had the halibut and the beet salad. Again, we were not disappointed! For our main dish I had the Tri-Tip and he had the Pork Porterhouse.  Both dishes were very satisfying.  We bought out wine from AZ wine to drink with dinner.  Todd is the general manager of Atlas and very knowledgeable of wines so he helped us pick one out and it went really well with our meal.  Can't wait to visit this place again.  This is a great date night place or if you want to impress your parents or out of town guests, but call ahead to make reservations.  If they don't have a reservation that night they don't open.  The ONLY complaint we had was that the appetizer and salads were so big that we were too full to eat our main meal so a lot came home with us."}
{"text":"Fun fun fun.. Truly unique dishes and appetizers with an amazing selection of wines/beers for your dinner next door at AZ Wine. It's a hole in the wall but somehow comes across as chic and cave-like. Talk to your significant other and suggest a date night, you will look smart and trendy for picking this place."}
{"text":"Unless you're getting a medical marijuana license or need your check cashed, there aren't many reasons to visit the Wilshire Plaza in Scottsdale. That is, except for Atlas Bistro--a quaint little BYOB diamond in the rough. Keep in mind my visit last night was during restaurant week, but my previous visits didn't disappoint either. I will say right up front that for 40 bucks, I don't think I could have done better.

I won't break down the entrees other than to say, if you consider yourself a foodie, go. You won't be disappointed. All the entrees enjoyed by my date and I were well thought out with great flavor and generous portions as well. Bring your own bottle or buy from the adjacent wine store. My only complaint is the 10 uncork fee. I think it should be 5.

Berkshire pork shank confit had an amazing cabbage and other accoutrements that enhanced each bite and was my highlight to a great dinner. My date loved the Hawaiian ahi tuna tataki. All in all, great food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"What an amazing set up! The restaurant, which is BYOB, is connected to a wine bar/store. Get there a little early and find a great wine to go with your meal. If you get there too early have a seat in their bar section and purchase a glass while you are waiting. The menu is 3 course prix fixe. I'm a vegetarian/Vegan and the chef was able to accommodate me and make me my own Vegan 3 course meal. It didn't let me down. Intimate restaurant, great for a date or a group. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Always amazing.  Started with the fois gras, unbelievable. Then the lamb tortellini,  amazing.  Finally,  the steelhead,  wonderful."}
{"text":"We went to Atlas for dinner during restaurant week.  The pre-fixed menu was amazing and had plenty of options.  I was truly impressed with the food and would have easily given the restaurant 5 stars if it wasn't for our server.  I'm not sure if he was having an off day, or was annoyed that it was restaurant week. He was pompous and arrogant and did an awful job explaining the menu overall.  My date was interested in trying the fish and the server pretty much pushed her in to taking a dish she did not want because she had questions about the presentation of the fish (skin on vs. skin off), he left her feeling confused and uncomfortable.  The rest of the evening he pretty much ignored us and disappeared by the end of our meal leaving us with another server,  who was actually pleasant.  Not happy to write a review like this considering this restaurant is the owners passion but feel obligated to share my experience."}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences in the valley. The produce is ridiculously fresh. Menu changes regularly. I'd eat here 4 nights a week if I could."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night - Just the wife and I, which is rare these days
Small, formal, quiet, really nice -  Not fancy

This is a byob right next to a wine store (how convenient), Todd our waiter Helped us pick wine for dinner, That was nice. The food was amazing, every coarse.  This is our second time at the Bistro, and we left there again promising each other that we would make this one our regular date night places.

6 Stars -"}
{"text":"A Christmas gift shared with great friends a 1982 Mouton Rothschild, the best part  of BYOB is the opportunity to pair your amazing wine with the talented chef's pairing. Atlas Bistro is designed for those who truly want to enjoy an amazing meal and that special bottle of wine.  Our meal was lobster, gnocchi, ragout mushrooms, superb duck, plus cheese plate for dessert at very affordable prices.  You know  its great when you see a local chef enjoying a meal too."}
{"text":"The best flavors I've ever had in my life combined on one plate. Highly recommended this restaurant!! All the flavors play so well together.  What an experience.  Cannot recommend this place enough.  This chef is a delight, and the service was exceptional."}
{"text":"Had my first dinner last week with a dear friend that said they had enjoyed other fine meals at this quaint hidden treasure.  From the charcuterie to the fine choices for dinner, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  Thank you for keeping such fine quality and amazing wait staff!  We will return!"}
{"text":"Took the wife for her birthday.  Raided the wine store next door for a bottle of champagne (yum) and the Pinot they recommended, which was fantastic.

We both had the seven course tasting menu.  I won't go through the details, but it was great (and eight courses, plus an amuse bouche, if I managed to count correctly) (would that be an amuse douche if served to the sort of Scottsdale resident that everyone loves to hate?)  It's not a Michelin-style tasting menu (no froths or layered liquids), but it was an absolutely delicious collection of interesting, well-cooked small plates.  Good atmosphere - it's small with friendly staff.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"This is a great spot! I've been there several times and always have great food. It's definitely more low key, but it's still a great place to have a wonderful dinner. It also helps that it's byob, great way to Save on the alcohol markups most places have.

I recommend ordering a variety of plates and sharing everything. The menu is constantly changing so you never know what you're going to get. Last night we had the bone marrow, red beans and rice, barramundi, and pad Thai. Everything was exceptional, don't think you can go wrong with anything you get."}
{"text":"Slightly late review, we ate here on 2/19 for a friends birthday.  There were 5 of us total and 4 of us were there on time.  We had informed them ahead of time that the 5th person in our party would be late and they said no problem.  The 4 of us were sat at our table, the place is tiny and we were right by the door.  I didn't have a problem with that, we love smaller places and the offerings that most of them have.  The 5th person was bringing the wine and we told then we would like to wait a little bit and we would look over the menu in the meantime.  Well, after we got our water upon seating, we never saw the waitress again!  She entered the room 5 or 6 times and never even made eye contact with us.  I had learned that the 5th person was going to be a little later than we thought, so we wanted to go ahead and get our order for our starters in.  Every time the waitress walked in the room she completely ignored us.  I understand we had said we were going to wait a bit, but at least come by and ask us if we're ok!  Well, by the time we flagged her down and placed our order, another 40 min went by before the starters even came out.  Then an absurd amount of time between the starters and the entrees... and again before dessert.  I know that smaller places tend to take longer and that's fine, but this was rediculous! 

There was also a dessert that we wanted to order and when we went to place our order she said \"oh, that takes and extra 30 mintues to make\"  Well, it had been so long by then, forget that!  It would have been nice of her to mention when we ordered our entree so we would know and could put the order in ahead of time.  Seems reasonable.

That being said, the food was amazingly delicious (once I sent the duck back to actually be cooked to medium rare rather than served almost raw).  The steak was absolutely delicious as was the lamb.  Food was 5 star, service - not so much.  My husband has been in the fine dining industry for years and we are big foodies, but I don't know how highly I would recommend this place.  I'm kind of torn considering how good the food was."}
{"text":"Friend picked out restaurant.  Inauspicious front.  Restaurant -- amazing.  Low key decor top notch service.  The food is creative, fresh and tasty.

We were big group sampled lots!  Escabeche sailfish ceviche, lamb belly confit w fried duck egg, hanger steak w Brussel sprouts crimini ragu red wine reduction.  Hand rolled farmers cheese gnocchi w charred Campari tomato and chorizo sugo.  Delicious.

Dessert was sticky toffee date cake rockin'.

Finally was best cheese plate I have ever had.

If there were more stars I'd give it to them."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. We went to celebrate an occasion recently and were pretty much blown away by the food. We moved from NYC and are kind of foodies and their food was as good as any we had at a nice place there. 
The place is nondescript on the outside and the atmosphere's a little wonky since it's attached to the wine store, so you can literally see into the wine store in some spots of the restaurant but after a bit I didn't mind. It's BYO which makes it all the more of an experience (and saves you some dough). The menu changes quite a bit, but the escargot was excellent, and husband had the fish which he loved. My steak was good, if a bit fatty. 
The service was fantastic..we started chatting with the waitress about hotels in Mexico and she went and printed us out something she recommended so we didn't have to write it down!
We would definitely come back in a heartbeat. Love, love, love. Not too many places like this gem..I hope they stick around."}
{"text":"Another visit, and still magical.  Phenomenal restaurant.  Still highly recommended and another great meal."}
{"text":"Surprisingly wonderful restaurant in an unpretentious setting.  The star is the food which is presented with careful thought and great creativity.   From the mixture of ingredients to the plating it is obvious that this is a restaurant that enjoys entertaining, challenging and ultimately creating a memorable  dining experience for its patrons.  If you want a wonderful and different evening of dining, this is one of the few places in town that accomplishes this feat with great aplomb."}
{"text":"We're snowbirds.   This is our most favorite restaurant in the entire Phoenix area.   In a word, 'FABULOUS'!"}
{"text":"Atlas is a place for the foodies, the gastronomers, folks with a trained palate and the adventurous. Not your place if you need Buffalo wings, burgers and fries or a grilled chicken salad. 

Like their website states: \"Organic, hand foraged, local, wild, line caught, sustainable and exotic are just some of terms you will find on the menu that our chefs revise daily\".  I love that! 

The fun part is it's a BYOB restaurant...attached to a wine shoppe (AZ Wine Company). So if you don't bring your own, shop next door first. Wine pairing assistance available. 

Reservations are HIGHLY recommended."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the whole valley. I have eaten here so many times over the past two years I could not possibly list all the delightful meals I have enjoyed.  I have never ever left here hungry, I don't think it's possible, frankly.  The chefs create artistic masterpieces in that small kitchen, using regional proteins and veggies, creating pates, jellies and cured meats in house, and even selling their delicious selection of cheeses retail out of the AZ Wine side of the shop. 

I highly recommend grabbing a bottle of wine and heading over there for an amazing meal."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise!!  I have worked in many fine dining and restaurants that put an emphasis on pairing foods and sauces that compliment each other, and being recently transplanted to the Scottsdale area, I am very pleased to find this jewel.  First, this place starts on a great foot by letting you buy wine next door at about wholesale prices, because all great food has good to great compliments of wine.  
I am used to the smaller portions and having many of them, my date and I both got the 4 course tasting menu allowing us to sample many of there plates.  It was a couple of weekes ago that I dined but standing out still were the endive salad, OsaBuco style short rib, and an amazing apple and fennel dessert.  I was very pleased to have found the Atlas Bistro"}
{"text":"Wonderful food but the owner is RUDE and Disrespectful.  I would not take the chance.  There are many other restaurants that want the business.   Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"When your really \"jonesin\" for an affordable high end meal this is your place.  We have been in Scottsdale for 6 months looking for something that wasn't a chain and wasn't the snobby Scottsdale scene, just a place where they rock out the food. And that's what they do here, they turn out dish after dish of great food. The staff is knowledgable and attentive and the chef has serious skills.  Wake up Scottsdale it's a byob place and its owned by a couple of guys not a corporation. Sorry its not a Fox concept or a Mastro's.  They are locally sourcing their products and they seem to really love what they're doing! You may not find a bathroom attendant but a few other things you won't find are \"Tex-Mex\", salsa, drowned meat in some sort of cheese sauce and you probably won't find to many green chiles.  Foodie is not synonymous with snobby! When you can only afford to splurge on a big dinner once in a while you want (well we want) the best possible product.  People who love food and want to get the most bang for your buck on great food, this is the best we have found in a city desperately needing a refresher course on great food. Grab a couple of  great bottles and ditch the Louis Vuitton one night and get down to Atlas Bistro."}
{"text":"Outstanding in almost every way.  The menu changes daily, although about half the dishes remain for more than a week.  Two quick and easy points:
1. The attached wine store is great.  Respectable selection, a bit higher than total wine or bev mo, but the corkage is less if you buy next door so go ahead and save the time.
2. Prixe Fixe options are 3 or 4 course.  Get the 4, the portions are small for America, but right in line with what a good dining experience should be, and that's variety.  Who wants to stuff themselves with 20oz of the same cut of steak?  Fat Southerners do...

 I began my meal with breaded sweetbreads.  They were fantastic... perfectly cooked and just the right amount to satisfy an early bite.  The next course was roasted golden beets with spinach and duck confit.  Awesome.  Great flavors.  My main course was a local ribeye which came out closer to medium than my ordered med-rare.  The cut was about 5oz in my opinion, but again, perfect to me.  The seasoning throughout the dinner was spot on... I mean perfect.  The final course was called \"death by elvis\" and was a chocolate, peanut butter, banana cheesecake topped with candied bacon.  NOTHING can describe the bliss here...

Lastly, in my opinion, very few restaurants cook well enough to bring a prized bottle of wine to for a special occasion.  Although I adore great wine, I hate it when the wine becomes the star of the evening, and not the food.  This is one place that makes the cut for those of you who have a great bottle and want impeccable food to pair it with.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Still one of the better places in town. Looking forward to the new menu after the summer break"}
{"text":"Must dine here. Amazing food. Menu changes daily! Use yelp check in for 2 free corkage fees"}
{"text":"I went to Atlas Bistro the first time a few years ago for an anniversary dinner...I remember it being delish, if a little heavy on the foie gras (I know, I know...I'm just not that big of a fan). We had ordered the chef's tasting menu. 

I tried again for Restaurant Week with a friend, and it was as delicious as I remembered. I started with sweet chile veal sweetbreads over creamed corn (good, but the flavor was a little reminiscent of sweet and sour fried pork takeout Chinese), salmon skin salad and grilled swordfish over white beans with local sausage and pepperonata. Loved the beans with sliced sausage, and the swordfish was meaty and fresh. My dining partner started with gnocchi with cauliflower and mushrooms, had a grilled romaine salad with anchovies and an over-easy egg on the top, and a pork porterhouse with ginger butter (?) After trying her dishes, I wished I wouldn't have ordered all of my selections, but they came recommended by the server. Her gnocchi starter was crave-able. 

Love the attached wine store (the girl that worked there helped us pick out an amazing malbec), and the general ambiance of Atlas Bistro. It's friendly and not at all stuffy."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!

Dined at this hidden gem on Thursday.
From seeing the pictures of the cuisine from time to time, I thought that the food was created by artists using a microscope and tweezers-the kind of place where the food is beautiful but complicated and you leave starving-
Besides the beautiful part, I couldn't have been more wrong!!!!!
The menu:
First course 
We all shared the pork belly,the big eye tuna and the circulated egg with potato mousse and lardons.
Second course 
Avocado soup with chorizo 
Roasted heirloom tomatoes 
Fava bean falafel 
Main course 
I ordered the wagyu hanger steak and had zero intention of sharing because it was easily one of the best steaks I've ever had,but that would have been mean..
Friends had the Hawaiian Ono and the duck,which were both equally fantastic!!!
We all declared that we were too full to order desert, but ordered 3 just to \"try\"...
I'm pretty sure I found a shovel to eat with because there was nothing left on any of the plates.
Coffee cake,chocolate tart,and \"eat dirt\" with dolce de leche and powdered peanut butter were the perfect end to a unbelievable meal.
Our server was the owner Todd (when was the last time you saw the owner of a restaurant touch a plate, let alone serve?)
Also got to meet his beautiful wife Natasha and the holy trinity of chefs,Cory,Juan and Joe- it blows my mind that a restaurant of this caliber has only 3 chefs!!!
I have been fortunate to have been able to dine at several of the best restaurants in America (French Laundry, the Inn at Little Washington,etc...)
Atlas bistro is as good as it gets..."}
{"text":"Food was great.  In particular, the veggies were like none I've ever tasted.  Completely excellent.  Owners/Operators were very nice.  Our rez was a little late, but hung out at bar and drank great wine at store price.  Owners waived our bill for the inconvenience, so I tipped 80% of the bill to bartender and wait staff.  We weren't even complaining b/c having so much fun at bar, but very generous of them to waive the bill.  Great place.  Going back again for sure."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Scottsdale!  The food is farm to market fresh with an ever changing menu.  It is BYOB, so you can bring the wine that suits your party and they provide the appropriate stemware.  The food, atmosphere and service were impeccable!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were at a wine tasting at AZ Wine and were seated in their bar area.  To our surprise you can order Atlas food as if you were seated in their dining area.  Atlas is connected to AZ Wine so it just makes sense.  Atlas' dining room is very very small and only 15 or so people can fit in the place.

Everything I tried was top notch.  Our table only sampled some appetizers but I can't wait to return to try some main dishes and of course more appetizers.

Here is the rundown:

*bread & butter - the bread was excellent but the butter was weird to me.  I'm sure it was freshly made but it had some type of smoky flavor and weird texture of which I wasn't a fan.
*cheese plate - very good, perfect for sharing while wine tasting
*crispy penne - it is exactly what the name implies - crispy penne.  lightly fried penne with excellent flavor because of whatever they put on it.  anyway, it was excellent and very unique.  easily my favorite dish.  I could eat plates of the stuff
*Schreiner's Italian Sausage - spicy and delicious.
*Gnocchi - not your standard gnocchi and very difficult to describe.  however, it was delicious and not overly sauced as they sometimes are."}
{"text":"This is a quite fine Prix Fixe restaurant. The food was very well balanced with great contasting flavors and textures. They make great use of locally sourced ingredients and fresh out of the area ingredients. The staff was knowledgeable and friendly and not overbearing. All in all highly recommended 
Km"}
{"text":"My wife and I go here every year for our Anniversary. We love the ambiance and low key. Make sure you plan this night, because you'll want a reservation. So worth it though! Food is reasonably priced for what you're getting. Wine is BYOB so stop by a little early to get a good wine recommendation."}
{"text":"This place has like... .4 or 5 tables....
MAKE A RESERVATION!

For reals.

This place has killer food.  Killer.
It's so good.  
I love it."}
{"text":"It's a shame that it has taken me this long to review Atlas.  My husband and I have eaten  here on at least six or seven occasions and the only time it was less than thrilling was when we ordered a la carte.  In other words, if you want to be wowed, get the tasting menu.  They put their heart and soul into making it an amazing experience with top notch ingredients and creativity in both the flavors and presentation.  If you really don't want to go the distance with what usually wnds up being more like eight or nine courses plus, then at least get the cheese plate for dessert.  They have an outstanding and ecclectic selection, as many have already said.

With regard to complaints about the corkage, I can only assume these come from neophytes who know not a thing about wine.  The rare opportunity to bring your own aged Burgundy or Bordeaux and enjoy it with haute cuisine is unknown outside of Atlas in this town -- please don't mention BYOB at Coup de Tartes, their food is awful by  comparison.  In any other restaurant of similar quality (I'm thinking of Vincent's specifically) you will be paying three or four times retail for a quality wine.  If you are interested in a cheap quaffer the corkage may not seem worth it to you.  But if that's what you're after you're also in the wrong restaurant.

We've eaten at The French Laundry, Bouchon, Chez Panisse, etc.  In this old pueblo Atlas is the best we've had by far.  If you know what quality food and wine is supposed to be like, then this is your go to restaurant."}
{"text":"Do you watch cooking shows? Do you take photos of your food? Do you have long discussions about your meals? If the answer is yes, this place is for you.

These are food people, seemingly trapped in a strip mall, only doing their thing four days a week.

But they do it well, and everyone from the waitstaff to the chef clearly take pride in the meals. 

So forget that it's strangely connected to a wine store with a run down bar. And forget that you have to bring your own bottle. Deal with it. It's about the food. It's about fresh ingredients and beautiful preparation. It's about artistic plating brought by knowledgable service.

Plan ahead and make a reservation for a special occasion. This place is on our short list for showing out-of-towners that we're developing some culinary cred here in Phoenix.

In case you care- the cold asparagus soup, the pork belly, and the wagyu beef were the highlights of our meal."}
{"text":"Atlas Bistro hires the very best upcoming chefs. The past chefs have moved on and opened some of the best restaurants in the metro Phoenix area. Atlas Bistro is a very tiny upscale ten table restaurant that's B.Y.O.B. It's adjacent to a very good wine shop next door. This restaurant serves up organic, local, wild line caught exotic dishes. All the dishes I had were painstakingly detailed and masterfully prepared.

We started with an amuse bouche of House Smoked Hawaiian Opah Fish with a caper and Lemon Aioli. It was so darn tasty I wish I could have purchased some to bring home.

My first course was a combination of crisp cucumber, sweet watermelon, creamy Israeli Feta, jicama, pickled honeydew, pistachio, fresh mint tied together with watermelon/lime vinaigrette. This was so light but bursted with bright flavors. Just delicious!

My second course was a very detailed beet salad. What stood out were the beets. You can taste how different a just picked beet taste. It has a totally different texture. The whole salad was earthy and bright from the fennel and tangy from the blue cheese. The crisp rye berries added some texture.

Dinner was Wild Hawaiian Hebi Spear Fish. The fish was mild sweet, meaty, moist with a nice tasty crust. This dish had many components but the one that stood out was the beet infused cous cous topped with harissa. It was so darn delicious it was the star of the plate. It had great flavors. I had to fight off my husband from taking too much of it. 

Unfortunately I was to full to try one of the interesting sounding desserts.

Being that this is a B.Y.O.B. place I do note your bottle of wine you bring might not pair with the plates you order but if you drink wine between plates it doesn't matter. As of the time of this review the corkage fee is $15.00"}
{"text":"I recently had the pleasure of celebrating a special occasion at Atlas Bistro, and it was simply AMAZING!! The service was wonderful, to say that the selection of wine is expansive would be an understatement, and the food is out of this world! They offer a three course prix fixe menu at a very fair price, and it is a wonderful way to enjoy multiple entrees. Our group enjoyed the tortellini in a creamy, velvety lobster sauce, the crispy duck breast, the waygu hanger steak, and the sea bass. Each and every single bite provides a perfect combination of flavors! Words cannot describe the decadent journey your taste buds will enjoy, you must go there and experience Atlas Bistro for yourself!!"}
{"text":"Am I stuck in some weird dream?

Are we really at a table in the aisle of a wine store with a shopping cart seated at the head of the table? (yes, see photo)

(***UPDATE*** Yelp decided ALMOST 2 YEARS LATER that my photo of THE INSIDE OF THE RESTAURANT was \"specific to my experience\" and therefore \"not appropriate for the general business listing\"...Yelp is too funny...)

Did the store clerk really just tell me to not get my good trusted bottles of wine and instead suggest three of the most putrid wines I've ever had?

Does the menu really have the phrase \"in season\" in quotes, as if the food isn't really in season but they are pretending it is?

Are there really people in this \"restaurant\" (see the use of quotes there?) loudly cheering for the Iowa Warhawks game?

Was I really just served cold duck confit?

Am I really eating it?

Did they really just charge me $10/bottle corkage fee on wine I paid for at the cash register 5 feet away?

Did I really just wait 20 minutes for someone to take my credit card?

2 stars because *overall* the food was good (even if my duck was cold)."}
{"text":"Waited 40 minutes with no apologies or explanation. So obnoxious.  Walked out and will NEVER return. There are far too many other restaurants in town with stellar service that we will choose to spend our money."}
{"text":"What a wonderful dining experience.  After having to cut out dairy, soy, nuts, eggs and gluten from my diet because of some allergies I thought eating out would forever be painful and tasteless.  However Atlas Bistro saved the day!  The server actually took the menu and highlighted the items that were compatible with my diet.  Then once the food arrived it was delicious!  I didn't feel like I was missing out on a thing.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to those who are looking for a vegan, or lactose free, or gluten free dining experience.  Not to mention my husband has none of these restrictions and enjoyed his food just as much."}
{"text":"One-half bistro, one-half wine store...

This restaurant is basically the back-room for AZ Wine Company.   You  enter through the wine store (where you can incidentally pick a bottle for dinner from their vast collection), then you make your way over to their dining area.  Don't worry -- if you purchase wine from their shop, they will wave the cork fee for dinner.

The cozy (read: teeny-tiny) bistro section, is dimly lit and sparse on  decor.  But if you happen to love candles and basic black everything, this is the spot for you.  Their menu is small, but the dishes are flavorful and well prepared.  Their website claims that the food is southwest inspired -- but that's not exactly how I would describe it.  The courses are more like French PLUS: French + Korean, French + Italian, French + Southwest... you get the picture.  The waiting staff is not only polite, and well informed about dishes, but discreet (i.e. they won't bug the hell out of you while you are trying to eat).  This is the perfect place to take a date.

NOTE:  The mapping feature doesn't accurately display where this business is located, so I uploaded a pic.  It is on Scottsdale Rd (just South of Thomas) in a rather non-descript shopping center, next to a beauty salon.

**UPDATE:  It looks like the map has been fixed :)"}
{"text":"What a suprised from a block lettered restaurant in a strip mall. 

The food is art. Thoughtful, well prepared, and perfectly prepared."}
{"text":"I have to speak the truth here. This is a gourmet hot spot but our waitress was having a major issue--she dumped a full glass of ice water on our friend's lap and not one course later knocked his glass of red on his lap, ruining not just his pants but his wife's sweater. I kept waiting for the announcement of free dessert or a bottle of wine, but nothing. No concession at all. Totally inappropriate."}
{"text":"Would have never known about this place without the recommendation of a friend. Thank god! From the moment we arrived, I felt as if I was in the comfort of my own home...if my home were chic and had a wine bar ;0). The environment was pleasant and welcoming. I love wine, and was impressed by the selection. I especially loved that I was able to wander without being \"bothered,\" while at the same time feeling comfortable enough to ask questions or for recommendations. Then the food arrived. Being from a city that doesn't cater to fine dining, I was \"wowed.\" I am a foodie at heart and cannot say enough about the care and sense of perfection that was put into every dish. Everything was a party in my mouth! Kudos to the kitchen and staff that made this a most memorable night with a dear friend!"}
{"text":"I would actually give it a 4.5 but that wasn't an option.  This is the second time I have eaten here and both times I have not been disappointed with the food. I love the fact that the ingredients come from local vendors. If you are a foodie this is definitely a place that you need to try, but reservations are a MUST.

Atlas is a hidden gem within a strip mall complex, part of AZ Wine Store. I enjoy the ambiance of the restaurant and the fact that it is limited to about 10 tables.  It is fun to be able to bring in our favorite wines to enjoy with the meal and you can always go buy a bottle once you decide on your meal. The service is a little to slow though, which is why I took off half a star.  Granted I don't like to be rushed, but the time it took from being seated to actually taking our order seemed like a bit much. Once we ordered most of the courses came out well timed but there was a bit of a wait again between finishing our meal and them checking to see if we would like dessert. 

Overall, I would be happy to eat here again."}
{"text":"It's almost not fair to describe a specific meal here because the menu changes and you cannot be assured to find whatever is described; you CAN, however, be assured of finding subtle-yet-dramatic presentation and an outstanding meal. 

I've had wonderful short ribs; fantastic duck; sweet scallops; tried Jerusalem artichokes for the first time in a lovely soup; had to-die-for desserts and phenomenal cheese plates. 

The venue is small and, although attached to a brightly lit wine shop (that now sells some super cool cheeses too), offers an intimate, romantic dinning space. 

This place is in my top 5. 

Heck! Top 3. 

I can't imagine turning down a chance to go here!"}
{"text":"Atlas is  a wonderfully quaint bistro, amazing food, wonderful experience. We will see you next year when we return!"}
{"text":"I don't quite know how to describe Atlas...it's part wine shop/wine bar and part high-end intimate BYO restaurant (so you can buy your wine and then uncork it and chow down!) I'll start out by saying that the guys in the wine shop know their shit and they have a good selection of wines at all price points.

On to the restaurant. It's a tiny place with just a few tables and it's all about the farm to table experience. You can expect a small but artfully prepared menu with fresh local ingredients.

On my particular visit had had a delicious beef tenderloin that was served up a sumptuous medium rare and topped with chimichurri and accompanied with fingerling potatoes, broccolini and roasted onions. A dripping of other delicious sauces. And it was so beautifully arranged it was almost too pretty too eat.....ALMOST.

Our server was Todd who is the owner he was gracious, hospitable, knowledgeable and enthusiastic. This place is definitely worth a go. The menu is constantly changing so rest assured you will have a different experience each time. Sure, it's pricier than most places and you're not going to leave stuffed but the experience and incredible preparation the experience you'll want to treat yourself to!


A Tip: Yelpers get a break on the corkage fee with check-in."}
{"text":"A friend of mine recently \"inherited\" a wine cellar collection that had been aging for many years.  We decided to pull a couple of bottles and check out Atlas last weekend for dinner.

The dining room is relatively small and nicely decorated with original paintings by a local artist.  We had a nice romantic candlelit table near the front window.

I noticed that all the dishes were made with top quality local ingredients whenever possible.  We started with a cheese plate and made four selections of various types of cheeses.  This was the best cheese plate I have ever had!  They were all delicious.

For dinner we had the filet and the lamb.  They were cooked perfectly.  I enjoyed learning about, and trying, the spigariello from Mclendon farms.  Basically, it's a leaf broccoli and it made for a nice green vegetable on the plate.

The service was friendly and I really can't wait to come back with another bottle of good wine in the near future."}
{"text":"My fiancee and I dined at Atlas yesterday evening for her birthday... and we loved it.

Right off the bat, my date was swooning since they printed \"Happy Birthday Brianna\" on the menu since I let them know the occasion when I made our reservation. Nice touch!

Todd is apparently the managing partner, and he's the one who took my reservation, seated us, and took care of us for the evening. And took care of us he did. The guy knew the food being served backwards and forwards and clearly was passionate about what was being served.

...and the food. Wow. We enjoyed everything we were served. Our favorites by course:

1st: Garlic Pork Saucisson (oh that Tomato Jam)
2nd: Pork Belly (kind of a deconstruction of the best pork taco of your life)
3rd: Hanger steak (beautifully cooked, flavored and textured with a nice char on the outside)

The entire meal was paced perfectly. The portions were not particularly large, but given that we had six courses total (my date and I shared everything), our appetites were totally satisfied. The plating and presentation was beautiful. The atmosphere in the restaurant is quiet and elegant. 

About the only downside I can come up with is the $15 corkage fee for a bottle of wine, but it's hard to fault them given that the overall value for this quality of food and experience."}
{"text":"We've been here 4 times, and I hate to review this restaurant because it is our favorite hidden gem.  Do not let the common exterior fool you.  The inside is truly special.  With the exception of Café Monarch, this is our favorite place to dine in Scottsdale, and those are two very different price points.  The atmosphere, the service, and the food are always amazing."}
{"text":"I love coming here.  The cuisine is second to none and the great part is that I can bring my own wine.  Every time I come here I know they'll have something that I like, as the menu is laid out in 4 course style with several options for each.  

The menu is always sophisticated and food is cooked to perfection.  The place is small enough that if you want your dish cooked just a certain way they have no problem.  

Last visit I had bone marrow that I'll now add to my last meal dishes."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in several years because the restaurant was a bit of a hike from our home. We actually hosted my husbands 40th birthday dinner here 10 years ago. Long story short so many restaurants migrated our way over the years that we quit venturing out for dinner. Fast forward, we moved to Paradise Valley  and couldn't help but revisit this once AMAZING restaurant. Well clearly Atlas Bistro has remained committed to amazing seasonal food with a contemporary flare. Every experience we have ever had at Atlas Bistro has been 5 . We have lived in the Valley for 15 years and would certainly say that this is without a doubt in our top 5, arguably top 3, restaurants in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"New to Scottsdale & being foodies this restaurant was high on our list to try. Todd the owner called back to confirm the reservation . Since it was for a bday we wanted it special. Todd greeted us & knew the menu inside out. He has a passion for his restaurant which shows in the presentation of the food. Every course we had was superb. 
Our daughter even had called ahead to give him specific instructions for a special surprise birthday dessert which was wonderful.

The restaurant is small so reservations are a must!

{"text":"I was under the wrong impression that the only place in Phoenix to go for a Molecular Gastronomy experience was Kai. I got searching in earnest to surprise my wife on her B'Day, mid June and came across Atlas. The first thing that hit me was the unassuming aura about the place. Small, Non-Pompous BYOB, tucked away in kind of a strip-mallish place (if one exists in downtown scottsdale).

The Personalized Menu they provide is quite an added value for effect, if you are truly trying to impress someone. But that is not all.

There were 4 of us at dinner and we were seated a quite corner, not that the rest of the restaurant was noisy. The walls seemed to have voice cancellation padding, the likes you would put in a home theatre room. Since there was 4, we pretty much got to taste two or three options within each of the three courses ( + a welcome palette).

Among the first course, Foie Gras was melt in the mouth. Duck Egg and Pork Cheek were the winners among the second course. The Groper and unbelievable Steak were the highlights of the final course. The lamb that I ordered was disappointing though. For some reason, it tasted dry although it was medium done.

Dessert options Lemon Cheesecake and Double Chocolate Brownie took us into trance. We were sad that we had to get out, but truly speaking we were stuffed and satisfied, and I had collected enough brownie points to last me another year"}
{"text":"Totally unexpected. I was not planning on walking through a wine shop in a strip mall into the most awesome meal I've had in AZ, honestly, I cant think of a better meal period. I actually love the idea of getting your wine right there then going to dinner.  Even though we had reservations and they were ready to seat us, we still decided to do a quick glass of wine in the bar first, just because another couple was playing Cards Against Humanity and invited us to play with them. Like I can resist any sort of game invitation. The bartender was very sweet and helpful, Natasha was our server and Todd was never far off. They are both so on top of things and helpful and friendly, you almost feel like you're having dinner at their house. The menu changes with what's in season so going into detail about what I ordered wouldn't be helpful, but here's the deal. Make reservations because it's a small place, go a little early so you can pick your wine (and don't worry about getting more than one bottle because once you order, it'll take like two seconds to go grab another bottle to go with dinner. And if one bottle of wine is enough for you, then we probably would never be friends), make new friends in the bar area to play games with, then have the best dinner ever. Oh and ps, it was maybe $60 a person for the prix fixe menu, I seriously can not think of any place less expensive at this level, I get that you have to buy your wine separately but STILL!"}

Az Wine is next door is you run out with what appeared to be a great selection.   Everything was fresh... yellowtail sashimi, lamb cheeks, and duck breast was perfectly cooked.  Finished with the Panna Cotta, delicious...  our friends surprised us with a nice bottle of port.   Perfect night...  awesome food with awesome service, our favorite wines with a non-pretentious environment that created a relaxing environment.  Not once, did we feel rushed through out the entire experience.  We will be back!!"}

Our favorite course? The Dessert!!! Deconstructed cheesecake with mango sorbet & also the bacon ice cream with bananas - yes... BACON ice cream! A-MA-Zing :)"}

Fluke crudo - fresh and refreshing. Paired with grapefruit which added a bit of (welcomed) acidity to the fish

Seabass - served with  a butternut risotto which was just fantastic. Not creamy and heavy like most risottos. The carrots and leeks were also cooked to perfection.  

Sticky Toffee Date Cake - yum. very strong flavors...and I thought the whipped cream served with it was ice cream! What a great way to end the meal.

The wine shop next door is such a good idea. The selection is decent and its pretty easy to pick a bottle or two out and walk through the doors and be seated. Service is great, the waitstaff is friendly and attentive.

All in all, perfect execution and with 15 people, that isn't an easy thing to achieve."}
{"text":"Amazing food, exquisite presentation.  Menu changes often, with an emphasis on the freshest ingredients.  The staff really knows the menu and is very helpful with helping the diner choose or even customize an order."}
{"text":"Probably my 20th meal here and it's always been amazing but they have a really good chef owner pairing going on right now. Better than Binkley's. Best restaurant in town.."}
{"text":"After reading rave reviews and wonderful sounding menu items, my bf & I checked it out on Restaurant Week.  We called late and accepted a table in the wine store.  big Mistake! Bad fluorescent lighting, horrible ambiance, so so service.. not at all what we expected our Saturday night dinner to be like.  Do not go unless u can be seated in the small, but much nicer actual restaurant.

We were charge me $10/bottle corkage fee on wine I paid for at the cash register 5 feet away.  I had read online that they did away with the corkage fee but aparently not.  BF's med rare waygu steak ($10 upcharge) was overcooked and all the food was just ok. Dessert was the best part of the meal. Our male server seemed a bit stressed out and would be looking around the place while he was talking to us at the table..thought quite rude n unprofessional at a nice high end restaurant.

I may give this place another try at the normal dining area, if I can convince my bf to go again."}
{"text":"We ate here this weekend and were pleasantly surprised.  Dinner was well executed with a build your own tasting menu experience similar to Danko's in San francisco.  We had the sashimi, beets, chanterelles, lamb tasting, duck and cabriole seabasss.  Spot on.  Presentations were beautiful as well.  Thank you atlas for a great meal."}
{"text":"If you are a foodie, then you MUST come and check out Atlas Bistro!!

To start, the restaurant is small.  There are only 10 tables in the entire place, and it is attached to a wine store (which is convenient since it's BYOB).  But the small space just adds to the intimacy and the experience.  The food that comes out of the kitchen here is like beautiful artwork.  The plating of the meals are absolutely stunning!  It's the type of stuff that you only expect to see at super fine dining restaurants in NYC, LA, London....Our eyes enjoyed the food without even tasting it.

And getting to the taste, every detail on the plate has a purpose and a distinct flavor.  All the ingredients are fresh, upscale, and unlike anything you would get at any other restaurant in the Valley.  We dined for restaurant week, so had the pleasure of tasting their many different dishes.  The 2 things that stuck out to me the most were the pork duo with tomatillo sauce (the sauce was heavenly), and the duck breast.  Now, I've eaten duck breast before, but never one like this.  It was cooked beautifully and you could cut through it like a perfectly cooked filet.  I ate every bite of that duck, and if they keep any duck items on their menu, I am going back just to see what other exciting things they do with it.

Our overall experience was unlike any other at Atlas Bistro, and I am looking forward to enjoying many other foodie friendly dining adventures there in the future."}
{"text":"Restaurant Week 3-course Prix Fix BYOB Dinner mostly an Afterthought of POOR quality and execution.
Stars were a 
+pork belly with sweet potato puree
+local mascarpone cheese (served with a burned-black samosa)
+Reidel glassware for our selections, brought from home reserves.

[We were not offered the normal prix fix or a la carte menus, only the Restaurant Week menu.]

UNDERSTAFFED
--No host stand was a bit awkward for me and guests. Eventually, staring diners shooed us to the huge neighboring wine store to wait. Just uncomfortable. Did we go through the wrong door?
!! You've GOT to acknowledge your arrivals within 15 seconds!
--Two servers (possibly also managers/owners?) for the entire dining room (8 tables?) knew their menu and ingredients, but the stuff of service was left behind
--$10 corkage (BYOB) means cork removal and first pour only. practice your sommelier wine bottle posture and pouring technique because YOU WILL HAVE TO POUR GLASS REFILLS YOURSELF.

IT'S ALL ABOUT THE FOOD?...
I can overlook almost any bad service if the food is fantastic, but...
--Lamb Samosa was BURNED, black and rock-hard on the bottom. Don't serve it, you lazy assholes!
--fried egg was over-hard, crispy, and brown, not \"runny and like-a-dressing\" as described by our server. _EPIC_ FAIL!
if you can't fry an egg, you should GET OUT OF THE FUCKING KITCHEN and bus tables where you belong.
if you can't catch your cook's mistake at what is supposed to be one of the valley's finest eateries deserving of five stars, YOU SHOULD BE EXPEDITING SHIT from a Village Inn toilet to its sewer.
--rib eye not trimmed, HUGE chunks of fat. if that's \"marbling\" then my cousin's 400-pound cottage cheese legs are STILTON.
--rib eye ordered mid-well (my guest; of course, i would never order meat mid-well) arrived mid-rare. THEN the server argued about it. WWHHAATT??!!
FUCK YOU. That is not \"grey with a line of pink\" IT'S FUCKING BLOODY PINK.
--rib eye arrived an oily pile of uncut sauteed green onions and more.
CUT THEM you lazy bastards. [see the pic for detail]


I went to Atlas Bistro after a year of prodding and reminders by others. I chose it for a reunion dinner that comes only every few years (the last one was celebrated at Kai). We were sorely disappointed. Note to self: when it matters, _always_ try a place first, no matter the recommendations or yelper reviews."}
{"text":"Service was slow, and the server had a slight attitude the entire night. We had 7 people at a large table in the center of the restaurant, and had brought in four bottles of wine purchased from the place next door. Every course took at 30-45 minutes to bring out, which was fine because we were happy and celebrating. Dishes were brought out a couple at a time, with a few minutes in between. I ordered a drink twice, which was really not a big deal. The server however was impatient when we couldn't decide on things immediately, or that my sister asked about the cheese that came on the steak. She and her husband keep kosher... she didn't need to explain herself, but he was not very accommodating. She also asked for some bread that didn't touch the pork on the charcuterie plate. She was brought a plate of 4 bite size slices.

I didn't have too many issues with this restaurant until the bill came. The food had been rich and good. My dad, who *never* makes a stink about price discrepancies, pointed out to the waiter that he thought the corkage fee was waived if you purchased the wine next door. The waiter said no, that's not true. My dad pulled up the Zagat's review where it says that, word for word. We just had 7 people eating 3-4 courses each, and you can't waive the corkage fee for 4 bottles?? A customer service-oriented person would have apologized for the confusion and waived the fee. A somewhat customer service-savvy person would have apologized and waived half the fee. This server said \"Yeah, we've been trying to get Zagat's to take that out for a long time. It's wrong.\"

Decent food, but don't expect service to be on par with the prices."}
{"text":"If you can get a reservation, Atlas Bistro is AMAZING! If you can't go get a glass of wine at the AZ Wine Bar and order a la carte. My favorite thing to do is go to the Thursday night wine tasting at the AZ Wine Bar and to share the five cheese, cheese plate with a friend. The cheese plate is phenomenal. (If you like fancy cheeses.) It is different every time, but in addition to the cheese, the plate has nuts and preserves and all sorts of interesting flavors and tidbits. After a week of work, that platter of cheese just makes me smile. (It is too much richness to not share with a friend though.) Between the wine and the cheese, my week goes from arg to ahhh, which is why I go back over and over and over."}
{"text":"We have dined frequently at Atlas Bistro for the last 8 plus years.  They are a restaurant that allows guests to bring their own wine with a very, very modest corkage fee.  Although this is a big plus the quality, reliability and service of the restaurant stands on its own!

The food at Atlas has been uniformly exceptional.  Corey, the Chef, is an artist in his menu development and preparation!  The food is not only delicious it is beautiful in its presentation.  Todd, Megan and Oscar do a magnificent job serving and interacting with guests.

In sum, Atlas is the finest restaurant we have found in AZ!  Rest assured you will enjoy your experience at Atlas."}
{"text":"Great food.  Love the BYOB.  But owners should not be waiting tables.  They have no humility or customer service skills. A bit snobbish to customers."}
{"text":"Cool concept - high end restaurant attached to an impressive wine warehouse. You can buy wine from next door and drink in the restaurant with $10 corkage fee (free if you check in on yelp). $55 for three course prix fixe - no a lar carte option. 

That said I have a mixed feeling about this place. Good service, sociable staff, the wine recommendation was great (they suggested a moderately priced bottle of wine over expensive one and it was delicious). Tasty beautifully decorated food. The sweet potato lobster soup ($15 up charge) was to die for, so was the pork belly... Yumm...

Here's the but... Most dishes were not hot enough as if they spent too much time decorating the plates. And too much waited time between each courses and the tiny portion leave us pretty hungry still toward the end. 

All in all it was a pretty good dinning experience. Not too bad for something in this price range but not spectacular."}
{"text":"This restaurant is as good as it gets.  I have changed my last meal on earth to include anything from Atlas Bistro.

Now for my handy tips...this place is BYOB, so bringing your own booze means it's time to splurge on that nice bottle that you have tucked away for a rainy day!  Having a wine store attached to the restaurant is DANGEROUS...but darn convenient when you aren't quite sure what type of wine/champagne you want to commit to until \"Game Time\".  We started with a 1/2 bottle of champagne freshly purchased from AZ Wine next door.  Then followed with an amazing French Red.  

The menu changes daily however there are a few wonderful dishes that stay on the menu, which include the sweetbreads, endive salad, and the delicious duck dish.  I went with a seasonal mushroom starter w/goat cheese (YUM!), procuitto & melon salad, duck, and yikes...I have forgotten what I had for dessert.  Damn French wine!  Needless to say, this was hands down, one of the best meals I've had in my life.  Manfriend says that EVERYTHING here is consistantly good, so I would try anything your palate desires.

Reservations are a MUST, since there are only 7 or 8 tables.  Atlas Bistro has many regulars that go in weekly, so many of their tables are already reserved each Friday or Saturday night.  This is a great place for a romantic date or a birthday or anniversary celebration.

The owners are AWESOME...it's rare that you ever get to meet the owners much less have them serve you and suggest dishes.  Atlas Bistro is a complete treat and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal here. We brought our own bottle of wine and took advantage of the free corking with yelp check in.  We started with the cheese plate which was presented on slate with 5 cheeses each paired with a  chutney or nut. If you love cheese, you will love this place. My husband had a vegetarian pasta dish (forgoing the lamb sausage) and I had duck. Both were delicious. We ended with a apple crostata which we shared. All in all, this was a great, intimate restaurant that we highly recommend."}
{"text":"Reservations are a necessity.

This ranks as one of the best, if not the best restaurant I've been to.  The food was EXCELLENT.  I spent time with my best buds and enjoyed some excellent wine and food.

Food and service of unparalleled quality and flavor included the bone marrow, peachy tomato salad, wagyu steak.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We have found a great place!! It is located in an unassuming, older strip mall but inside it is very nice.  The service and food were all fantastic! An added bonus we brought our own favorite wine (seasmoke Pinot). We had the 4 course tasting and it was the perfect amount of food. While everything was great, my partner loved the Wagyu Bone Marrow and I can't decide if the risotto or skirt steak were the best. Every course was delicious and we were doing a happy dance in our chair over the desserts! We can't wait to return and if you run out of wine, just go back how you entered at the wine bar, awesome selection."}
{"text":"For me, this place is very special. Low-key, intimated, simple menu with the freshest locally grown vegetables. Three courses meal menu is plenty good & tasty with great selection of wines, BYOB ($15 cork-fee for each bottle). Services was excellent - Thanks Oscar & the team to make it was a great time. Cheers"}
{"text":"My husband and I have dinner at Atlas Bistro 5-6 times a year.  We like to go here for special occasions and sometimes just a \"night out\".  The food is amazing!  The restaurant is small, so make reservations in advance.  The other thing to keep in mind is that because of the size, there is only one (sometimes 2) waiters for the whole restaurant.  Thus being said, service can be slow, but friendly.  Just plan on savoring the food and wine and having a relaxing evening.  I highly recommend Atlas Bistro!"}
{"text":"Incredible dinner and presentation!  We hadn't been here in years and went for a friend's bday. The staff were wonderful and very attentive. The presentation of the food outstanding. I'd never had fois gras and so yummy. Thx for a very special evening !"}
{"text":"Atlas Bistro is exactly what a restaurant should be. When I went on a Tuesday night there were only about 2 other tables being used, so it was very quiet, which was great. Our waiter was excellent, he did a fantastic job describing each dish and making sure we always had drinks in our glasses and got us anything we needed. 

I believe the menu changes often and they offer a $50 3 course meal which consists of a starter, a soup or salad and an entree. When I was there in the middle of March I was able to try many things and a couple of my favorites were the gnocchi, the prime ribeye and the pate, which was a $5 extra. 

My only issue with this restaurant is it is a B.Y.O.B. and they charge a 10 dollar corking fee. Usually that wouldn't bother me, but if you are buying the alcohol from their wine store that is connected to the dining room then they should not charge that corking fee in my opinion. 

Overall though I was thoroughly impressed with Atlas and look forward to going back very much."}
{"text":"Atlas Bistro provides everything you could want in an establishment and is truly a hidden gem!

Atlas is BYOB and like Stacy M. has mentioned you get free corkage with a Yelp Check-In. Don't have a stock of wines to bring in? They have local wines within the same building of the small restaurant and the staff is greatly knowledgeable on pairings. (Wine glass emojis x 10). I love the usage of local ingredients. Not only does it ensure freshness, it promotes the community, local farmers and showcases the best produce from Arizona. The restaurant itself is small, intimate and unpretentious. The noise level is perfect, adequate lighting for dinner and felt cozy. Definitely something you would not expect based on it's outside appearance and location.

This review is for Arizona's Fall Restaurant Week with Atlas providing a Three Course Prix- Fixe Dinner Menu. Red Wine was brought from home to accompany this meal.

First Course: Hudson Valley Foie Gras Pate, Oregon Blueberries, Candied Walnuts, Shaved Grapes, Celery Leaf, Granola, Balsamic, Blueberry Coulis

While Foie Gras is rich and buttery, this course is offset with refreshing and light flavors from the fruit, the balsamic's acidity and the walnuts and granola for texture. I thought this dish was good, but probably would have enjoyed the pate if it was lightly seared as it was served as a shaped disk or with a more substantial textural aspect like a wafer or cracker.

Second Course: Braised Niman Ranch Pork Shoulder, Northern White Beans, Carmelized Sauerkraut, Cippolinis, Celery Root, Pork Rinds, Ham Hock Consomme

I'm a big fan of Niman Ranch, so I had to get this course. This was literally a fancier take on Pork and Beans. The Consomme is poured table side and was clear, light but flavorful. I found the Pork Shoulder was a good portion, but found it a tad bit too salty and slightly tough. I believe the seasoned pork shoulder combined with the ham hock consomme was just a touch too salty together. 

Third Course:  Australian Wagyu Hanger Steak, Citrus Cured Yolk, Red Lentils, Tempura Mushrooms, Broccoli, Curry Cauliflower, Black Mustard Demi-Glace

How the hell can you pass up on Wagyu? Obviously, a rhetorical question. The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare. The pieces were tender and had that lovely, gamey distinct flavor of Wagyu. I thought the Tempura and Demi-Glace paired well with the Wagyu and loved the Citrus Cured Yolk that was microplaned over as a garnish, it added texture and gave the dish a little lift. The Curry Cauliflower I could have done without as it was way too overpowering in regards to the rest of the dish.

All in all the staff was so genuine, knowledgeable and sweet. Food came out in a timely manner and was explained perfectly. Honestly, one of the best places I've had here in Arizona and I'm so glad to have made it out here for Restaurant Week. Here's to more foodie finds such as this!"}
{"text":"Atlas you primordial Titan - you left me wishing for more. 

Great concept, and truthfully, really great food. They offer a 3 or 4 course prix fixe menu that is creative, seasonal, and delicious. I just loved the root vegetable salad and the pork belly amuse bouche. The lamb was wonderfully done, although I did not think it went well with its bed of kale. Unfortunately, the scallops were cold and slightly chewy - I need my scallops to melt in my mouth. 

The space is very small and intimate. Note that if you are seated in the middle of the room, you will feel like the other guests are very close to you. You may get bumped into as other guests head to the restroom (which is on the other side of the wine store, past the dingy mirrors, the wood-paneled bar, and the 1970s couch). I enjoy the fact that Atlas is BYOB, and that they are conveniently located within a wine store with a great selection. I do not like that they charge a corkage fee for a bottle of wine that they just watched me buy. Seems to lessen the experience. 

And I think that is what is so disappointing.. For a place that boasts haute cuisine and fine dining, you expect a little romance, a little charm - more of an experience. Instead, you find yourself sitting in the back of a drab wine store, sipping overpriced wine, trying to avoid watching the neighboring table eat their meal. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but at this level, you are also paying for the atmosphere and the experience, both of which are lacking at Atlas Bistro. There are several other places in the valley that serve excellent, seasonal cuisine, and if you are looking for a place with charm, I recommend you go to one of those instead."}
{"text":"Where do I start?  They let you bring in your own wine or you can buy wine from the store that is connected- which is perfect. 

The service.... tough to beat.  Every time I come here, they are thoughtful in recommendations and attentive to all details. Their passion for great food and drink is contagious. 

I started with the melon soup... yes, I had melon soup. It was incredible. My wife started with the tuna dish. From there we had had the pasta and pork dishes. To finish, the wagyu and duck. 

For dessert, we had the coffee cake and peanut butter bread pudding. Amazing.

This place is one of our favorites in Phoenix."}
{"text":"So everyone says they wish they could give 6 stars for certain places, and I am having the same dilemma. My solution is that because atlas bistro was so good I am actually downgrading every review I have done by one level. Both my date and I could not name a better meal we have ever eaten (and she is way more of a foodie than I). All the negative reviews are for people who book large parties, ummmm guys this place is smaller than my bedroom, maybe this isnt the place to go for dinner with a dozen people. 4 should be the max. I definitely had a foodgasm at the table after the meal, my moaning was so loud I am sure I disturbed the other customers."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 8:15 and weren't seated until 20 min after. The male host was rude and didn't apologize, rough start to the evening. 

They ran out of 2 out of the 3 dishes on the pre fixe menu. Those were the two I wanted. 

Everything was played the same and had no personality. The food was good, everything was just plated the same way and we felt like that wasn't a ton of character or charm from the dishes. Good thing was the company was better and we brought 2 bottles of wine to share. 

What ruined it for me was the first impression of the host and service was a little slow. So many other places in the valley that I would rather dine at."}
{"text":"Atlas Bistro is an intimate little restaurant in a strip mall in South Scottsdale. My boyfriend took me there on my birthday and we had a really nice experience. The service was excellent - everyone was very friendly. We noticed someone at another table asking questions about the kitchen and they invited him back there to check it out. 

Atlas is attached to AZ Wine Co, so it's BYOB. AZ Wine co has a wonderful selection to choose from. We ordered a gnocchi and roasted squash appetizer that was delicious - lots of layers of flavor. We also shared the roasted beet salad. This one was okay. The beets were excellent, but I thought the salad was over dressed and some of the lettuce was very bitter. I had their fish dish with potatoes and spanish chorizo - I enjoyed every bite! I wish we had enough room for dessert because all of them looked amazing! 

I probably won't make it down to Atlas very often, but I'll definitely go back in the future."}
{"text":"Love Atlas. Creative, local food. Menu is always changing.  Only strange thing is the location. Its funny to take people there in the weird strip mall (you know, next to the weed and gun shop) and then have such an excellent experience."}
{"text":"A remarkable dining experience.  

Atlas puts their best foot forward to ensure you have an ultimate dining experience focused on your food & wine while allowing you to be in control.  As you navigate your way thru their prix fixe courses that you've likely selected to pair with the wine that you have brought for the evening, the Atlas staff accommodates & guides you intelligently for the entire evening without distraction.  

Their service is impeccably professional.  

It's been a couple weeks since i dined there but the flavors of many of their dishes still pleasantly haunt me.  The butter poached lobster claw bisque was so rich, yet  balanced and still retaining the characteristic traits of the dish.  

The duck confit was one of , if not the best duck dish I've ever had.  Subtley spicy, mildly gamey, and flavorful in each bite.  

The Niman Ranch Pork Chop with maple glaze was simple yet executed with great craft.  Warm textures while contrasting sweet & salty.  

All around a wonderful success, I truly look forward to my next dining experience at Atlas."}
{"text":"Finally have a chance to get this post up, and I cannot believe we do not have a thread on Atlas Bisto because of how amazing it was. They had always been on \"the list\" of places to try, I wish we would have moved it to the top sooner. It is located in a strip mall on Scottsdale Road toward Tempe in a strip mall, as most of the good restaurants in the area are 

Walking in it is a bit confusing as you go through AZ Wine, which is a very large wine store, with a great selection of Sake, Wine, Half Bottles, Craft Beer (Aventinus) so turn to your left and there you will see the dining area, if no one is immediatly there someone will pop up shortly as there are only two people working the front of the house. It is BYOB so you can bring a wine if you would like to or get there a bit early and browse, or bring your own wine and during the meal add something extra if you run out of wine (which we did!)

Below is the menu choices that we had on offering

First Course

Smoked Paprika Braised Pork Shoulder, Queso Cotija, Guacamole, Shaved Baby Radishes
 
Korabuta Pork Belly, Butternut Squash Hash, Tamarind Peach Glaze
 
Hand Rolled Porcini Gnocchi, Maitakes, Ginger Cabbage, Black Bean Miso Cream


Second Course

Grilled Romaine, Fried Rainbow Valley Egg, Spanish Anchovies, Capers, Raisins
 
Roasted Striped Beets, Gala Apples, Horseradish Cream, Prairie Breeze Amish Cheddar
 
Applewood Smoked Duck Breast, Peaches, Sweet Corn, Cranberries, Almonds, Arugula, Frisee *Add $5


Third Course

Grilled Pork Porterhouse, Spaetzle, Spaghetti Squash, Bacon Brussel Slaw, Amish Asian Pear Butter
 
Niman Ranch Tri-Tip Steak, Roasted Fingerlings, Baby Rainbow Carrots, Black Mesa Ranch Feta, Caper Aioli
 
Wild Caught Market Fish, White Beans, Cherry Tomatoes, Fennel, Baby Spinach, Green Goddess (Swordfish)


Now on top of this there were a couple items on top of the normal menu, there were Sweetbreads for the First Course (+5 supp) and there was another option for the second course but I do not recall what it was

Course 1 - I had the Sweetbreads which were had a sauce that was delicious (i cannot remembe what kind, the good kind) with a plum apple slices to freshen it up for some acidity and they had a cornmealish fried texture to them -- I had been to Blackbird (1 star Michelin Chicago) who also served up a sweetbread 1st course, and this preperation blew it out of the water, and that was our favorite app we had there -- Also they gave a very good portion size as well, this was not a Restaurant Week portion to make tons of money this was their normal portion just at a discounted price - one thing that always drove me crazy about RW is that many places don't put their best foot forward and try to make a quick buck, instead of trying to gain return clients

The Mrs had the Pork Belly, which I have to say was one of the best pork belly's i have had in a very very long time. It seems they are always overcooked and stringy instead of melt in your mouth lucious. The flavoring and cooking of it was perfect, again to releate it to Blackbird (because two of the 1st course apps were the same ingredient) Blackbird overcooked theirs and it we left some of it on the plate, I was lucky to get one bite of the Pork Belly from my wife

Our friends we went with, he ordered identical to me, and his wife went with the Gnocchi, she really enjoyed it however I did not try any of it

Course 2 - I had the Smoked Duck Salad, which was not exactly what i was expecting and I was pleasantly suprised. For some reason I expected warm duck, but it was chilled duck with just a light touch of smoke, to set off the flavor against the tangy peaches and sweet corn, it was amazing and way better than what i had pictured in my head - there was also TONS of duck in it, every bite huge piece of duck - just great

The Mrs had the Grilled Romaine with Anchovies, which was also very good, nice anchovies on it and she really liked it, however the duck salad was where it was at - our friends wife went with the off menu salad and she really liked it, I passed on trying it because it wasnt beating the duck salad

Course 3 - 3 of us had the Grilled Pork Porterhouse which was one of the best pork dishes that I have had, the only other one that i would rank up there when they had it on the menu was the Stuffed Pork Chop at Cowboy Ciao (no longer on the menu) this was was equal to it or better, they cooked it pretty close to medium rare which is perfect for me and everything about it was good, lots of flavor - The Mrs had the steak (when Todd was explaining the menu he was very elaborate about everything on the menu and then he was like \"we have steak too\") so that was really on the menu because you have to have a steak on the menu - It wasn't bad but when all the other flavors on every other course is off the charts, just a good steak isnt the same - however as a good husband I gave multiple pieces of the Pork Porterhouse to Mrs Dapuma

{"text":"Half bistro---half wine store?  It works well.  What else would one expect in Scottsdale?

Truly Southwestern-accented menu with an international flare. We started off with mussels in a kettle of Baja chowder.  It was amazing!  Our entre's were just as flavorful. We were told the dishes are seasonally tweaked which adds great variety to the menu.  This is one of those places that have a small menu and it shows with the exceptional quality of dishes.  They did it right."}
{"text":"I kick myself in the butt for not coming here sooner.
My hubby took me here for my birthday dinner since I love BYOB restaurants. This place is small (about 10 tables) and have a three course meal for $60! I ordered the foie gras for the first course and it was melt in your mouth good. For the 2nd course I had the hand made tortellini. I could have licked my plate clean. For the third and final course I ordered the Grouper and my husband had the Wagu Hanger steak with Peruvian purple potatoes. Everything was so fresh and decadent! We have decided to come here more often and try new things they offer. Their menu changes weekly so it keeps it very exciting.
Reservations are a must!"}
{"text":"Ummm....delicious, that's all i have to say about this place. small and quaint, had the owner as my server, who was very knowledgeable about the products being used. 

once again the food was exceptional, I had the seven course tasting menu and everything was light and very fresh. the highlights would consist of a red Alaskan snapper dish with quinoa and melon dish wish a wonderful rhubarb sauce, and a cheese course of purple haze and peaches that went perfectly together. 

The time in between dishes took a little longer then I would have liked but with all the attention to details it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of having a fabulous meal here a few weeks ago, sorry for the late, late review but here it is!! 
Always wanted to come here for dinner, its a BYOB place and nestled right next door to AZ Wine Co( a fantastic wine shop complete with tastings, helpful staff and an amazing selection of wines). 
We were in a large group of 10 and they are very accommodating for large groups, private events, etc.
              Started with the acorn-squash soup with celery and apple salad. The soup was smooth and velvety, liked the side salad (couldn`t finish it) but a great combo! I selected for my entree the lamb t-bone(hadn`t had lamb in a while, was in the mood for lamb! Plus it was paired with a nice Cab!) Served with the lamb was an assortment of figs, fennel and endive.
Everything was delicious, lamb was tender and flavorful. For dessert-I chose the cheese flight( I was trying to keep my sugar low and avoid chocolate, others chose the chocolate chip cookies with nutella sauce and were very pleased!! You can go next door to AZ wine co and pick out a bottle and enjoy it with your meal(there is a corkage fee) or try one of their pairing dinners. The men updates frequently, can`t wait to go back and try something else!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful hidden gem. Small room, not much ambiance.  Terrific, fresh, inventive and interesting menu.  Changes frequently . Superb service. I highly recommend !!"}
{"text":"While visiting Scottsdale my husband and I happened upon some nice Yelp reviews of Atlas Bistro and it sounded like the perfect foodie place for us to check out, so a quick thanks to all the folks below!!!

Atlas Bistro is attached to a wine shop with a knowledgeable staff who can pick out a great wine or two in your price point before you head into the restaurant.  We picked a nice Pinot Noir and headed in for our 9pm reservation. 

As others have stated, it is a small room, perhaps 12 tables.  When we arrived the room was dimmed, save a few uplighting spotlights and candles on the tables.  Very warm romantic feeling.  Every other table full of contented smiling guests.  We were handed menus - and here is a good time for me to mention pricing - there are two options, 3 or 4 courses priced at $55 and $65 respectively.  The extra course is a salad course that I highly recommend.
We were served an amuse, and then our courses processed out one by one and into my admiring eyes and mouth.  I wont go into our dishes but everything was perfectly fresh, delightful with a slight southwestern twist.  Just to tempt your senses, my entree was a beautifully thick, tender and juicy lamb chop served with olive tapenade.  Absolute perfection!
The waitstaff was lovely, accomodating and good at sensing how much you wanted them around or not around.  Overall we were absolutely thrilled with this find, and hope to come back some day!"}
