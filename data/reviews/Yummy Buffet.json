{"text":"Great selection even for our vegetarian daughter. The spicy chicken was very good. The price is reasonable and the service was decent. Arrived about 7:15 pm on a Saturday night. They were very busy, but the crowd thinned out by the time we finished a little after 8."}
{"text":"Great price for the lunch buffet......The food itself tastes good.....The selection is not what we expected.....they have to much \"americanized\" foods......If i am hungry for Asian food then that is what i want and expect....The staff, although friendly, need to work on visiting the tables a bit more......"}
{"text":"I have been here three times in as many weeks.  It is relatively new. Not the building, itself just this restaurant.  Yummy Buffet boasts very affordable pricing for a very expansive lunch or dinner buffet.  The choices are really diverse, from sushi, sashimi, fresh stir fry, typical Chinese standards and not so typical- yet traditional Asian specialty dishes.  There is a lot of seafood and fish offerings as well as a good sized salad and desert bar.    With everything to choose from it is not surprising that there would be a few missteps.  On my first visit, I am kind of overwhelmed by the array of options.  I settle in with things I am familiar with first- chicken satay, kung pao, sesame chicken, crab puff, more chicken stir fry and some baked salmon.  All of it was remarkably tasty and enjoyable with exception of the crab puff.  Something strange and a little fishy.  No problem- the rest is really good!  I return for seconds hitting a few other tables where there is peel and eat shrimp, pot stickers, egg drop soup, steamed broccoli and long green beans- again- all is going down well.  The crappy crab puff is erased from my mind.  I finish with pride, some banana pudding with vanilla wafers.  Yum!  My friend tries the white tennis ball looking thing from a pot.  he says it is a very traditional desert.  I watch as he bites into the un food like object.  Inside it I see what looks like light purple jelly.  MMMMM???? okay- He says it is good and finishes it.  Fun Fun I go back to my yummy creamy yellow slick in a bowl.  Approved!  Not only was the food and service better than expected, I did not get sick!  Yay! 4 stars My second visit  -another success- even the crab puff tasted normal and good! 4 stars! My LAST visit- I knew I was pushing this too far- sure enough- it was lousy this time. inedible, even!  What happened?  This time every piece of chicken had some type of hard grizzled appendage or hidden extremity.  I went through several napkins as mouth fulls were discarded.  I am so disappointed.  I will never come back- even if it was an off day- I will never take that chance again, UNFORTUNATELY."}
{"text":"Skip this place. Spoiled fish in sushi (ruined my appetite before my first bite), room temperature crab tasted funny (wife didn't eat afterwards), cold food in the hot trays, and hard chicken that had been under the lights too long. Six of us went and none of us ate a third bite. Pepsi was good though."}
{"text":"This place is the perfect example of what a typical Midwestern all-you-can-eat Chinese buffet is -- A greasy, cheap, and really disgusting dump. Despite being known as Madison's worst Chinese restaurant, the place generates quite a lot of business. There's some people who'll happily pay $5 and not complain -- I've noticed that college students will eat practically anything as long as it's cheap and for some others, it's a guilty pleasure. Me? I wouldn't take the risk... unless I was really drunk or had to accompany a stoner friend or something."}
{"text":"MEH! Not so yummy buffet.   The wife and I ate there tonight and we were terribly disappointed with the quality of the food. Much of it was stale, lukewarm (the warming tables aren't NEARLY hot enough!) and I was totally put off by the dark and somewhat unfriendly atmosphere.   I'll stay away from this place and spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Meh. Not a big fan of this location. I think I'll stick to the one off Gilbert and the 202."}
{"text":"Another good new Chinese buffet. Not as good as some of the others but not bad. They had a couple of different trays that were good (corn souflee , big crunchy chicken wings and BBQ pork chops ) all of which were real good. The dessert selection was a little weak with mostly canned fruit (nothing fresh accept the watermelon).The service was fast and friendly  and they fixed up the decor so I will give Yummy a solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"$5.99 for a lunch buffet.  You spend more than that at your local fast food burger joint.  In all seriousness, this is a \"it is what it is\" situation.  The food isn't too bad.  For that price, the food and selection isn't bad at all.    They have good chicken wings at times, and the crispy shrimp has been good both times I went there.  They have items like pizza and curly fries for those with kids that are picky eaters.  Look for a coupon in the mail and give it a go."}
{"text":"The word is that the Yummy actually had a grease fire in the kitchen, and then the health department got involved and shut it down.  Regardless, this restaurant no longer exists. Thankfully."}
{"text":"How about NOT So Yummy Buffet?  I added this hole in the wall Chinese buffet located off State Street just because I wanted to highlight how clever and witty I can be.  But really you honestly get what you pay for.  FIVE BUCKS for all you can eat and all the soda refills you want.  I mean you could probably camp out here from lunch until dinner with your textbooks (although I probably wouldn't recommend it).  I do take my freshman brother here frequently because he eats like a horse--seriously he does.  After a nice dining here for almost an hour (me for the most part watching him grub) as we were walking down State he demanded we go to Taco Bell to get something there as well.  Wow....wow."}
{"text":"I wrote an earlier review, but it seems to have disappeared.....no problem.  I just wanted to provide an update.  I have been here at least 6-8 time since they opened and the food is about the same.  So they are not reducing the food choices or quality to save money.  But what I wanted to update the other yelpers about is that they have raised their prices significantly where they no longer have a economic advantage over their like competitors.  Their lunch prices are now $8 although they still advertise that the lunch price is $6.  Why do establishments do this?  Are they just stupid or are they trying to be shysters and mislead the public?  These kind of things really irritate me when businesses do this kind of thing."}
{"text":"I definitely agree that Yummy Buffet is worthy of five stars.  I've certainly eaten at my share of buffets and thoroughly enjoyed my lunch here today!  It is extremely reasonable at $5.99 for lunch ($8.99 @ dinner) and with an additional 10% off coupon, the total was $11.78 for two buffets with no drinks.  The decor is very comfortable, pleasant and it seems extremely clean and well run.  Service is prompt and friendly.  I'm trying to watch what I eat right now, so I avoided many of the traditional entrees (ugh!) but there is certainly a very good variety along with the Mongolian grill.  My attempt at a \"healthy\" buffet experience included:  * Salad bar - romaine tossed w/ a light italian dressing, mushrooms, black olives, cucumber/tomato/red onion salad, fresh oysters  * Sauteed green beans (extremely fresh and delicious), sushi (no deep friend rolls), edamame, teriyaki beef on a stick, spring roll (I cheated)   *Vanilla frozen yogurt - really yummy....no pun intended :)  They also offer \"to go\" boxes for $5.99 at lunch and $6.99 at dinner...with a coupon it's a flat charge versus how they normally charge by the pound."}
{"text":"Was yummy for the price you cannot beat it, I got the coupon for $6.99 for lunch buffet and it had everything! They had sushi, Asian food: teri chicken, shrimp tempura, noodles, beef broccoli, sea food, stir-fry, fresh fruit, salad bar, fish, and i am sure I forgot to mention things but they had EVERYTHING!  I didnt know if it was a promotion but I took my friend to try it out and we both couldn't believe how good it tasted for that cost!   It was at a good location and it was very convenient to get to!   If your in the area stop by, its at a great location at the corner of the block. You cannot miss it!"}
{"text":"My wife & I went this buffet restaurant for lunch recently. In our opinion, we sampled many dishes, including the Mongolian Barbecue & also the sushi.  All dishes are average.  The waitress was friendly."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet at Yummy Buffet is cheap. But that's not a bad thing! I use this buffet to benchmark the value of other restaurants in the Valley. Even though it's dirt cheap, the food selection and quality are on the same level as other $9-$10 lunch buffets. It's even better than some of the chain restaurants in Arizona.  I went to the Elephant Bar with a friend last week and she ordered the sweet and sour chicken for $12+tax+tip. It came with a side of rice. The food did not taste good. You don't realize how awesome Yummy Buffet is until you purchase a terrible meal at a restaurant. The $12 that she had wasted could have fed 1.85 people at Yummy Buffet.  Overall, if you're going to out to lunch  with friends, family members, poor college students, church goers, Yummy Buffet is an excellent place to eat."}
{"text":"$5 all you can eat 2 week old Chinese leftovers.  Or that's what it tastes like anyway. Yummy."}
{"text":"Super cheap. 8.99 for dinner and I got a 20% coupon discount from the ad. Went here to celebrate my birthday. I was going to put 4 stars since it wasn't really bad, the place was huge - but the service SUCKED BIG TIME. We had to keep on reminding to have our drinks refilled. Our server looked lost (maybe couldn't handle a group of 10 people). Their sushi is pretty decent though. But yeah, return factor about 50%. Just cos they are cheap, and across walmart."}
{"text":"When I had come here when it was zen buffet I don't remember it being all this bad.  There were two things that i cared for one particular sushi that seemed deep fried with a delicious sauce and the Mongolian BBQ although my meat was over cooked today.  It was definitely worth 5.88 using the 10% off coupon. I would not want to pay more than that for their food.  Everything that was sitting out besides the lemons and coconut macaroons tasted weird.   The worst was the either the sweet and sour chicken the mustard chicken  i believe or the orange chicken. I just know that all tasted very very strange."}
